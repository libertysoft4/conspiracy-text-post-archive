        <p><span class="badge badge-primary">185</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;2018-03-15 by <a class="author" href="../../../../../../../../user/TechVikings.html">TechVikings</a></p>
        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Hey guys I need your help. Basically this person was left a voicemail. It left a series of words and numbers and more words. <a href="https://twitter.com/strayedaway/status/973604056005570560?s=21">https://twitter.com/strayedaway/status/973604056005570560?s=21</a> here is the voicemail to listen to. After he posted it live to Twitter this week an unknown user from Malaysia told him to remove the tweet. He provided screenshot proof and username to. After getting through the simple message it came down to something along the lines of “SOS danger the situation is dire they are not human danger (the string of numbers here) ”. Which of course seems like a very troll post. But after googling the numbers it turns out their coordinates are in Malaysia, and not just that but also a tourist attraction. Now checking his post history last week he posted about when he was in his car there were people taking pictures of his house with the flash on (this is all days before he got the voicemail). There’s a whole lot to this puzzle and not quite sure but hoping someone can look into and help. The “not human” piece seems very childish. Although googling the numbers in a string I found right away a DNA genome strand and test data. <a href="https://www.ebi.ac.uk/arrayexpress/files/A-MEXP-200/A-MEXP-200.adf.txt">Here</a> is what I found. It seems to be way over my head and from someone named “Yong Quian”. Anyone know what’s going on?!?!</p>

<p>Edit: full voicemail transcript: sierra delta alpha november golf echo romeo sierra oscar sierra india tango india sierra delta india romeo echo foxtrot oscar romeo yankee oscar uniform tango oscar echo victor alpha charlie uniform alpha tango echo bravo echo charlie alpha uniform tango india oscar uniform sierra tango hotel echo yankee alpha romeo echo november oscar tango hotel uniform mike alpha november 042933964230 sierra oscar sierra delta alpha november golf echo romeo sierra oscar sierra</p>

<p>Edit 2: <a href="https://twitter.com/strayedaway/status/974074062623342592?s=21">here</a> is the tweet from the Malaysian user. When you try to search his account username in twitter you CAN find him, but shows “This user is currently restricted due to unusual behavior”.</p>

<p>TLDR: Weird voicemail leaves almost a joke of a threat. Decoding the numbers leads to Malaysian location and DNA Genome testing though. Anonymous users from Malaysia are telling us to take down these posts. </p>

His profile pic is still there though so i think he just deactivated to fuck with his followers but i dunno i could be wrong. Any ideas?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you scroll through the top replies here, some guy said it&#39;s his friend and he has a link to a bit of conversation with the OP before he deactivated. Apparently he deactivated because he&#39;s been getting coded messages from bots non-stop, and he&#39;s not handling it well. He&#39;s ok, just spooked as fuck</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Interesting that these so-called coordinates are remarkably close to the city of Medan. There&#39;s an old, creepy sea legend of a ship called the Ourang Medan that is very similar to this modern day saga. Short version, a ship called the Silver Star receives an SOS morse coded message from a nearby ship called the Ourang Medan with a similar message. They go to investigate the ship and find the crew all dead. I&#39;m wondering if this is a modern homage, and the creator put the coordinates there as a sly wink.</p>

If it did go down and this was the last recorded message it wouldn&#39;t be delayed 2 years in time nor sent to some new yorkers cell. So the whole missing plane thing can be forgotten. Right now were on contacting the provider of the Genome testing (Yong Quian) and going to 3 different locations the number sequence can bring us to. Also what China would have to do with any of this.

    <div class="md"><p>it&#39;s most probably part of a &quot;wangiri scam&quot; - which is where a person with an unknown number either leaves a voicemail with a phone number to call back.. or has a known number and leaves no voicemail and just rings and hangs up. the idea behind the scam is that the phone number is a premium number which charges a large amount to your phone bill per minute - so the object is to get you to call the number and stay on the line for as long as possible. with a voicemail such as the one left &quot;SOS DANGER&quot; etc it&#39;s trying to entice the person to call the number. the problem here is the number called is an international number, so if they were genuinely in an emergency situation they&#39;d call a local number, not some random international one. it&#39;s possible the phone number left is also wrong and an additional digit has been left. </p>

<p>if it&#39;s not a wangiri scam, then it&#39;s just bizarre. </p>

NATO code is basically universal for clear, definite, messages.

When I got this call I turned to my friends and told them it was justa a recording reading off peoples&#39; names. That&#39;s what I thought it was although I did consider it weird to be repetitive I never thought about it again until now. I&#39;m covered in chills rn.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I never post on reddit, you can check. This is not to get upvotes I&#39;m sharing this in fear. I texted someone who was with me when I first saw this asking if they remembered me telling them about a call of an automated voice listing off names but they only said &quot;maybe.&quot; The reason I thought so is I picked up on Sierra Oscar Sierra but she pauses in between so I heard Sierra, Oscar, Sierra like a list and hung up when I got to the numbers without paying attention. My guess is much of the general public probably got a call from an unknown number and reacted the same, because it&#39;s not meant for us, nobody would think of NATO without seeing it in print. If it was to scare the public they would have said something in black and white. If it was to get a call back for money it wouldn&#39;t be an unknown number. It&#39;s on repeat, it&#39;s a broadcast, it&#39;s not even a normal automated call. The resource OP listed about the DNA is an analysis of 3D printing synthetic nucleotides in the genes of an aligent mouse. Aligent mice are what&#39;s used in stem cell research and biological development, and it&#39;s no secret that we are engineering synthetic RNA, the info is available online through multiple research universities that we&#39;ve already created two entirely new, successful, synthetic and never before seen in biology letters in addition to ACTG. We can already officially program dna to do unnatural things by simply changing the code that it uses to develop and copy. This message is scaring me because I have no doubt we&#39;ve experimented with programming human genomes the same way, I mean that&#39;s WHY we do it to mice, and I can&#39;t find the motivation for fraudulency in this warning. When I heard that voice again my entire body erupted in chills. Take it or leave it but I&#39;m already studying aerospace engineering and astrophysics to eventually build a space shuttle and get the hell out of here anyway so it doesn&#39;t change much for me but the more of us who come, the better chance we have to evolve.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My comment got deleted because I used a new account instead of my old one but I’m reposting. When I looked up the coordinates, Estuaire showed up, which seems to be on the coast of Africa. What’s interesting though, is they found debris that was confirmed to be from the Malaysian 370 Flight on the coast of Africa. Though I’m not sure if the debris was found near Estuaire, it makes sense that the coordinates would lead there if they were found in Estuaire. Also, an oceanographer suggests that Malaysian flight 370 could be preserved underwater similar to Air France flight 447. <a href="http://www.freemalaysiatoday.com/category/nation/2018/01/26/mh370-remains-may-be-preserved-underwater-says-oceanographer/">http://www.freemalaysiatoday.com/category/nation/2018/01/26/mh370-remains-may-be-preserved-underwater-says-oceanographer/</a></p>

<p>So if the discovered debris wasn’t found in Estuiare, maybe the whole plane is preserved underwater like the oceanographer suggested, but near Estuiare? It seems like there are all different interpretations of the coordinates, but they all seem to fit together, strangely, to Flight 370. North Sumatran, Africa, Malaysia. They can all be connected to the plane crash. Maybe the specific numerical string was to convey the multiple different coordinates on purpose ? I’m sort of stumped with this whole thing, what do you guys think?</p>

Not to reach too far but maybe the mante wanted to be left alone and when they were discovered they started terrorizing the people of Malaysia in te Aceh area. They figured American people had a better chance of helping them than local forces? Just a thought.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>All though this is a convincing story, it is however, pretty fake or coincidental. A distress signal would have no way to be intercepted by a piece of equipment such as a cell phone. A cellphone has no way of intercepting or decoding a message in such capacity as it is not a radio capable device to receive such a message. I am no expert but by basic knowledge of how specific devices are connected, one cannot receive a voice mail out of the blue like this. The message seems wayyyyyy too bunk and the numbers seem too good to be true, the message from the twitter user would be sent as Malay alphabet, not translated into english letters. It is a cool theory but highly doubt anything to come of this. It seems like a hoax. Too many holes in the story from getting a voicemail somehow via radio frequency, the photos being taken of him inside his home (no proof of it), and the latitude/longitude numbers, I looked up Malaysian phone number sequences but they have 8 digits excluding the +04 at the start, this sequence has 12 digits with an 04 starting at the front, it would be Malaysian. </p>

I transferred the numbers as a hex code into text I get this: )3�B0 . nothing much right. so I instead transferred it as text TO hex and got this: 30 34 32 39 33 33 39 36 34 32 33 30. Again gibberish? now just take the numbers as they are don&#39;t let them repeat. and you get 30 34 32 39 33 36. they are coordinates. I may have done this wrong but, tyr it yourselves. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was really into these conspiracy theories but then I started thinking and literally nothing makes sense. (i know most conspiracies dont but hear me out) It just doesn&#39;t make sense for the fact that the voice mail isn&#39;t really a voice mail because it was &#39;transmitted&#39; from something sounding like a looped radio. How does that message call in the first place? I saw a lot of lack box conspiracies but yeah, a black box is just going to make an outgoing call to a random guy. I saw some other conspiracies on solar flares but I feel like that still doesn&#39;t explain things all the way. I&#39;ll be honest, what you guys found is really interesting with the flights and the coordinates, it almost fits perfectly that it kinda ties in with everything. That also leads me to believe it&#39;s just a hoax because the dm he received on twitter was an indonesian man/woman? The coordinates also go into indonesia. Coincidence? I also wanna add that the &quot;they are not human&quot; is a little dramatic but that might just be me. I just think that this might be a well thought out plan for this guy to become &#39;twitter famous&#39;. Unless one of his friends decided to prank him because a friend would know his ohone number, twitter, and where he lives which would explain why he saw someone taking pictures of his house. ALSO i wanna point out, if this is real, and someone was really taking pictures of his house, how does any of that tie into this. Like i know its weird and all but think about it, someone takes pictures of his house, he receives a strange voice mail and gets a weird dm. W.H.Y? Am I supposed to believe that hes a &#39;chosen&#39; one or something? Maybe he&#39;s being monitored? Who knows. I&#39;m still going to keep researching on more theories though but keep me updated.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot; I saw a lot of black box conspiracies but yeah, a black box is just going to make an outgoing call to a random guy.&quot;</p>

<p>Regarding this, there&#39;s theories about the plane entering a &quot;time rift&quot; or different dimension.</p>

<p>Imagine the plane vanished in 2014 then re-entered 2018 with little to no time changed to the people on the planet. Maybe the sender wasn&#39;t aware of the 4 years difference and sent it to that number, thinking it was someone else.</p>

<p>It&#39;s not unusual for phone companies to recycle old phone numbers after about a month or so a phone is deactivated... </p>

<p>So he could be a &quot;random guy&quot; that got a phone number of someone that was &quot;important&quot;.</p>

<p>Now also imagine YOU randomly got the voicemail, bring it online for answers and everyone asking &quot;what makes you the chosen one?&quot; and you&#39;re like &quot;I DON&#39;T KNOW, THAT&#39;S WHY I POSTED IT TO FIND OUT&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re not wrong to be skeptical, but if this is a legitimate sos message from a vessel either air or waterborne it would make sense it is in NATO code. NATO code is basically universal for clear, definite, messages. Pilots, military, and (I think) ship captains are generally required to know English and NATO if they operate in international waters or airspace. Sierra Oscar Sierra has been a thing as long as at least the time of the Titanic, and it was an automatic reaction then, so probably already codified or at least tradition years before. </p>

<p>Even as an enemy combatant I&#39;d rather yell SIERRA OSCAR SIERRA than AYUDAME, HILF MICH, or any other foreign code in an emergency. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Dozens have come forward. We&#39;ve pretty much crossed off the planes black box. If it did go down and this was the last recorded message it wouldn&#39;t be delayed 2 years in time nor sent to some new yorkers cell. So the whole missing plane thing can be forgotten. Right now were on contacting the provider of the Genome testing (Yong Quian) and going to 3 different locations the number sequence can bring us to. Also what China would have to do with any of this. It&#39;s probably some poor attempt at a scare with to many loose ends to be taken seriously.</p>
