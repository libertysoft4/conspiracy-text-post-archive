        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Title pretty much sums it up. The whole &quot;flat earth movement&quot; feels very inorganic to me.</p>

<p>I can&#39;t help but ask myself; Why is the media suddenly covering these people? There have always been a small percentage of people who actually believe this crap, but why is it news worthy now?</p>

<p>Then I see newscasters and pundits lumping flat-earthers together with all conspiracy theorists.</p>

<p>Think the DNC rigged the primary? &quot;Haha I bet you think the earth is flat too, huh?&quot;</p>

<p>Think the official vegas shooting narrative sounds a bit fishy? &quot;You&#39;re no different than the flat earthers and anti vaxers!!!“</p>

<p>I feel like the whole thing is just another way to discredit anyone who holds an opinion outside of the mainstream narrative.</p>

<p>Thoughts?</p>

<p>Edit: To clarify, I don&#39;t believe the flat earth theory, in and of itself, is inorganic. There has always been small a portion of the global population who believe the world is flat.</p>

<p>The part I find inorganic is the massive amount of media coverage for such an obscure topic.</p>

<p>Edit 2: I will not feed trolls. If you wish to believe that the entire sum of mathematical and scientific evidence pointing to our current view of the known universe is bullshit, then enjoy. Do not expect a reply from me when you rant about how true the flat earth bs is, while offering zero evidence to support your stance.</p>

<p>I am a man of science. Logic, reason, and even basic science/mathematics show us the earth is near round. If you expect me to believe otherwise, you&#39;d better have some amazing evidence (backed by science and mathematics) to convince me.</p>

<p>I&#39;ll wait.</p>

Kennedy assassination conspiracy theories.</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sometimes the most surprising / unbelievable mechanisms are the natural ones.</p>

<p>Remember Elsagate? It&#39;s been theorized on this sub that it&#39;s an indoctrination/whatever secret programing shit.</p>

<p>Myself being a quant developer (mathematical programmer for hedge funds) I know people who earn 10x, 20x, 50x of the money I make by.. exploiting the mechanics of non-financial services. Such as AdWords, such as AdSense, such as other advertising networks. They combine gut-feeling with rigorous A/B testing and statistical optimization to game the system and get paid a <em>lot</em> of money. They&#39;re very well educated people, yet the things they earn their fortunes on are:</p>

<ul>
<li>porn</li>
<li>casinos</li>
<li>shark loans</li>
<li>various enlargement pills and other snake-oil products</li>
</ul>

<p>and the presentation + content they produce (that is rigorously tested and proven to maximize their profits) is usually:</p>

<ul>
<li>shocking</li>
<li>gruesome</li>
<li>revolting</li>
<li>grotesque</li>
<li>endlessly stupid, obviously fake, literally screaming SCAM, WTF!</li>
</ul>

<p>yet that is what the majority of internet &quot;consumers&quot; love to consume. Clickbait, buybait, watchbait etc.</p>

<p>Now I don&#39;t personally know anyone who makes money via Youtube (probably because I know mostly technical people, not creative artsy types), but I can easily see how the very same characteristics of &quot;clickbait&quot; content would apply there to maximize revenue. And that&#39;s likely what happened there.</p>

<p>Of course you have to be a certain kind of a person to exploit the internet &quot;consumers&quot; in such a way, but there are levels. The further down you&#39;re willing to go with the level of your content, the more revenue you get. So unfortunately the most idiotic / degenerate content will get most views (especially true for children and elderly target groups).</p>

<p>I think I remember Flat Earth starting as a joke a decade or so ago. I can <em>easily</em> imagine how it can be the most clickbaity crap pseudo-conspiracy on the market, thus generating the largest revenue for people willing to monetize it.</p>

<p>The real world is a sad place, but it can also be fascinating to observe.</p>

I&#39;ve heard quite a lot of stories tying the LHC to esoteric symbolism like Vishnu , the godess of destruction and chaos ( if I&#39;m correct?) has some statue out then front or some shit. But like I guess I&#39;m open to other fringe scientists who explain things in a new way like Nassiem harramiem ( I think this is correct) who talks more about the fractal nature of the universe etc. I&#39;m open though so if u have some views or literature on what it&#39;s all supposedly covering up, I&#39;m all eyes</p>

<p>Now, I&#39;m not saying it&#39;s a bad idea to question anything and/or everything... but if you&#39;re going to question science, you should study and understand the science you&#39;re questioning. It&#39;s not like science is some kind of elite consensus that nobody is allowed to question, or is inaccessible and impossible to verify. You can test and observe the results of any experiment to verify the data yourself. If you find something doesn&#39;t add up, you can have your results peer-reviewed. If you end up blowing a hole in the accepted science, you will be celebrated for helping us to better understand our universe. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is a common theory. I&#39;m not sure though. I don&#39;t doubt that a bunch of people actually belief the earth is flat or at least not as round as the pictures show.

<p>There are tons of super smart people that also believe the story of Noahs Ark is literally true. A dude building a big ass boat capable of taking two of every single animal in the world. Some people also believe in vampires and fairies. Which sounds about as dumb as a flat earth to me. So I&#39;m not sure the flat earth thing isn&#39;t organic. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>From my understanding of the history behind the flat earth theory folks I believe it&#39;s totally inorganic. I first saw an increase in discussion surrounding flat earth around 2004. Around that time a website called &quot;The Flat Earth Society&quot; came to my attention.</p>

<p>A friend/work associate of mine bought a membership and was showing us all the site in the office. They explained that it was set up as a gag site used to mock people who don&#39;t believe in science.</p>

<p>It wasn&#39;t until recently that there&#39;s been a noticeable uptick in discussion surrounding flat earth. That uptick came about through multiple youtube accounts publishing videos and social media accounts pushing those videos for views.</p>

<p>Of course, these videos also typically advertised websites that discuss the flat earth theory.</p>

<p>So, my theory is that people are monetizing conspiracy theories in general. Plenty of folks have noticed that conspiracy content makes money and has an established community. There are other examples of fringe theories that have been promoted in this same manner.</p>

<p>While I&#39;ve been a moderator in this subreddit I&#39;ve become aware of accounts on this site and on others that are definitely more interested in monetizing certain conspiracies than actually discussing these topics. </p>

<p>Social media is a business now and it isn&#39;t just independent grassroots individuals involved in making media in order to disseminate information. There are marketing companies involved now that, if you pay attention to the production and frequency of publication of some of these videos, infer large teams are involved.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I remember this as well, however the flat earth thing sounds like someone trying to muddy the water in many regards, not just with flat earth.  You can hide the truth by drowning it in noise.  I think FE stuff is exactly that, but what is interesting about the FE stuff is it isn&#39;t just coming from electronic bots, its full BS coming from the other side of the veil.</p>

<p>For one example, take someone like Tracy Twyman who is a well researched author, she has always taken some clues from the other side in regards to her research leading her to some interesting research.  However, if you follow along with her things she starts down this flat earth, earth is in now in an artificial dome, type stuff.  </p>

<p>As I&#39;m going through her history of videos of her talking with people about all her subjects, I could clearly see where the info she was getting from other side was literally fucking with her, but because she is finding &quot;evidence&quot; to back up this crazy stuff she is being told, giving her syncs and everything.</p>

<p>As time goes on the BS they are feeding her gets even more off the rails to the point she has lost the ability (last I watched of her) to do any more meaningful research.  So what interests me is in this case is not so much the content of the flat earth, earth in a dome, we are in an artificial reality topics being portrayed as real physical phenomenon rather than the esoteric style concepts of the mystics they really are (even then its not that accurate, just part of certain cults belief systems) - what is interesting is the coordinate feeding of misinformation from the other side in conjunction with manipulating data and events on this side to give her syncs to convince her its real.</p>

<p>Given her spat with Bloomberg, I do wonder if it has to do with him fucking with her, but given how big these things are (literally just had someone spouting this stuff off to me in a SpaceX thread) and spreading, I&#39;m not sure if its a single group or entity trying to pull this off.  Also with all the inversion stuff the illuminati are doing trying to gain energy after their system was destroyed makes me think this is more a measure of panic than calculated planning.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hmm... That&#39;s a very interesting theory on this. I do not doubt for a second that there are groups out there monetizing conspiracy theories. Everything is monetized in our society.</p>

<p>I am just particularly unnerved by the mass media pushing flat earth theory. Then the same media organizations release articles that imply flat earth theory and all other conspiracy theories are equally fallible. I see the same thing happening with the anti-vax movement.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s a BBC article showing my point quite clearly. They talk about how dangerous conspiracy theories are by linking them to the anti-vaxers. By doing this they are making it increasingly hard to publicly express an idea that is not in line with the mainstream narrative. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Funny anecdotal story incoming..</p>

<p>I started going to a chiropractor recently in order to get some expensive joint pops after a neck surgery. These guys have televisions and little android devices around the office that run slideshows of info-graphics involving chiropractics.</p>

<p>Most of the slides are your normal &quot;chiropractic care heals&quot; type jargon but the other day when I was using one of their neck stretching contraptions the slides went deep into anti-vaxx type info.</p>

<p>It pretty much was the type of content you see here. I really wanted to ask the &quot;doctors&quot; where they pulled the content they made the slides from but didn&#39;t know how to phrase it without possibly offending someone.</p>

<p>Mind you, I&#39;m somewhat in agreement with a lot of what the anti-vaxx community has to say but I was baffled that this business took the leap required to allow the content to be disseminated in their office. I was impressed but also completely flummoxed. It&#39;s a quick way to alienate potential or already established clients.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have seen the same thing!!!</p>

<p>My wife has been seeing a chiropractor for quite some time now. She has told me repeatedly about anti-vax pamphlets being on display in the office. This particular chiropractor has also discussed, at length, the &quot;healing effects of crystals.&quot; She actually told my wife that, in order to calm our one year old son who had been throwing temper tantrums regularly, we should have him wear an amber pendant.</p>

<p>Hence I have very little respect for this chiropractor and her &quot;medical advice&quot;.</p>

<p>Having heard your story, it makes me wonder if the chiropractic community as a whole embraces the anti-vax movement.</p>

<p>I agree with some of what the anti-vax movement says, mind you. I wholeheartedly believe the companies making vaccines would cut corners to increase profit margins. </p>

<p>I do not believe there is a link between vaccines and autism, but I feel as though that is a straw man argument meant to discredit the anti-vax movement.</p>

I usually steer clear of them. Ive found that the ones who use a more science based approach to be much better chiropractors.</p>

<p>Personally, I wonder if the whole vaccine autism thing was actually a disinfo campaign created by the vaccine makers for use as a tool to discredit anyone linking vaccines to other issues. or to poison the minds of future jurors in liabilty lawsuits by those harmed by side effects.</p>

Somebody (presumably big pharma) decided this information was gaining too much attention, so they astroturfed the everliving crap out of the anti-vaxx movement to change the message from &quot;stop using neurotoxins in vaccines&quot; to &quot;vaccines cause autism&quot;.</p>

    <div class="md"><h1>Please define &quot;Jewish&quot;.</h1>

<p>Rabbinical Judaism and Biblical Judaism are two different things.</p>

<p>Rabbinical Judaism in short is not Jewish at all.</p>

<p>It is the synagogue of satan that masquerades as Judaism that is warned about in Revelation 3:9 and Revelation 2:9.</p>

<p>Jewish people who follow actual Tanakh would come to the conclusion that Jesus is the messiah and &quot;Christianity&quot; is really Biblical Judaism.</p>

<p>People who follow the Talmud are disobeying God by following the word of man, and not God.</p>

<p>Proverbs 30:4, Genesis 1, and the Isaiah 53 all point to the holy trinity - God, the Holy Spirit, and Jesus Christ, all written in Hebrew Scripture.</p>

<p>There is plenty more to back up this claim all throughout the old Testament.</p>

<h1>Earth IS flat.</h1>

<p>The reason news stories are now covering this FACT is because it would cause more people to come to the realization of the truth if they did not, as people would question why the media totally ignored such a large movement.</p>

<p>This way, newscasters can ridicule and inject false claims in to the minds of the masses in order to slow the spread of truth while the satanistic pedophiles figure out a way to get their cattle back in order, so they can rape our children and enslave our bodies.</p>

<p>This is no conspiracy to discredit conspiracies, this is the conspiracy that ties all conspiracies together.</p>

<p>God exists, the Earth is flat, and satan is the god of this world.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/N30/comments/7530hc/revelation_1318/">It is no coincidence that calculations for the globe Earth lie continually come to 666.</a></p>

<p>The globe lie is the grand delusion also spoken of in The Book of Revelation.</p>

<p>Satan, who is the god of this world, has blinded the minds of those who don’t believe. They are unable to see the glorious light of the Good News. They don’t understand this message about the glory of Christ, who is the exact likeness of God. 2 Corinthians 4:4</p>

<p>Do not love the world or anything in the world. If anyone loves the world, love for the Father is not in them. For everything in the world—the lust of the flesh, the lust of the eyes, and the pride of life—comes not from the Father but from the world. The world and its desires pass away, but whoever does the will of God lives forever. 1 John 2:15-17</p>

    <div class="md"><p>These are a few questions I have that I can&#39;t really find anwsers on the internet.
1. How does the moon affect the tides and waves? It&#39;s 1/8 the size of earth, it&#39;s 2 thousand miles away from us, and has a weaker gravitational pull than earth. How does it over rides earths gravity to affect the water. And how come it doesn&#39;t affect the clouds, its water vapor.
2. Hot air balloons, I get the argument that the earth doesn&#39;t rotate underneath them because it&#39;s like tossing a ball in a car. But what about the two guys who did stratosphere jumps. They were 30km and 33km in the stratosphere and out side the ozone, however they both landed 12 miles or less from where they took off. How?? The earth should have rotated underneath them, it takes over 2 hours to reach that height and the earth rotates at over 1,000 mph so...
3. So according to the big bang everything in space is moving, our own sun is traveling around 43,000mph. How come not one star has moved out of place from any constellation? Humans have been looking at and mapping the stars for a couple thousand of years and with all that moving nothing.
I have other questions but I need to go back to work.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You picked some points that you can actually solve yourself using some math.
1. The moons pull is much smaller than the earths yes, but the entire oceans are fluid so they are susceptible to even the slightest fluctuation in net force. Its not really the force of moon itself that directly causes the todes. Its the differential. When the moon is on one side of the earth, it has a much smaller effect on the sides because it is farther away. Its like having 2 equal items on a delicate scale, put a small object on and it tips over even though the force is miniscule.</p>

<p>2.Why would the earth rotate underneath them? If the surface has a tangential velocity of 1000 mph so does the jumpers, this velocity does not disappear when leaving the atmosphere, that would violate the laws of physics. In fact, orbital rockets use this rotational velocity to their advantage, most rockets launch with the rotation of the earth instead of against it to use that extra velocity to their advantage.</p>

<p>You need force to eliminate velocity, where does this force come from? The rotational velocity is horizontal, so we need a horizontal force to eliminate it. But there is none, once leaving the atmosphere there isnt even any friction. Therefore when something goes up and comes down the earth does not drastically rotate underneath it.</p>

<ol>
<li>Think of it relatively, 43,000 mph may seem like its fast, but when stars are light years away it is actually really slow. You picked constellations, these are made of stars that are incredibly far away from each other, we can actually detect the movement of the stars, but to the human eye its not noticeable. </li>
</ol>

<p>There are lots of stars we can see moving very noticeably! Look up the video of the stars at the center of the milky way orbiting the massive black hole. These stars are moving much faster than 43,000 mph so we can see massive movements with telescopes, just mo to the naked eye because they are so far away.</p>

<p>These are all good questions, but they lack the fundamentals of classic physics. I suggest you take a class on calculus based physics, it will make you rethink how the world works. (the newtonian part is the most important)</p>

I first hand witnessed an eclipse a few months ago and seen a round shadow over the sun. I have had a video chat with an Australian at midnight while it was mid day there. I do a lot of research on space tech. I have been to the ocean and it appears to curve slightly to me. I was curious as to how you came to believe the earth I flat.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>you saw a solar eclipse where the MOON passes in front of the sun and the round silhouette made you conclude the EARTH was round? very faulty logic.</p>

<p>yes, it is day for about half the earth at any time and night for the other half, again, this is no proof at all the earth is a ball.</p>

<p>doing research on space tech means what? have you researched how rockets might work in a vacuum with no molecules to thrust against?</p>

<p>finally, yes, we have a 360 degree view of the world - on the ocean there are no obstructions so you can see the full circle of the limits of your sight. again, this is your vision, nothing to do with the shape of the earth.</p>

<p>It was going through every so-called reason like this that supposedly proves the ball earth that has had me conclude that earth is not a ball - ie there&#39;s a complete lack of evidence.
do you have anything else?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My only complaint is you use the word theory with the flat earth shit. This is science and in science a theory can be stronger than law. </p>

<p>Flat earth is a weak hypothesis as best.</p>

<p>No math or experimentation exists to support the flat earth</p>

<p>These people need a history lesson and a turn with a theodolite. </p>

<p>But your point about it being so effing big is the exact reason these mental migets can&#39;t grasp it. </p>

<p><a href="http://www.joshworth.com/dev/pixelspace/pixelspace_solarsystem.html">This webpage</a> puts it in perspective. </p>

<p>I have heard some state that a half a moon up in the day is proof of something screwy. No. It is proof you can&#39;t grasp astrophysics. </p>

<p>Fair enough though. It is a math heavy field. </p>

<p>What about the hologram moon? Hollow earth. Satanic occultism (that actually works) ruling the world. Reptilians. Nephilim. Hillary being a failing clone. Suppressed history/tech. Literally every incidence of public violence being MKULTRA.</p>

<p>I agree.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>But agian where is the heat coming from?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Good question. It could be because the earth has a molten core or it could be some other explanation. We don&#39;t know and people shouldn&#39;t act like it&#39;s an obvious thing.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Or why do we have gravity on this &quot;possible&quot; flat plain?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Dense things sink and less dense things rise. That explains the phenomenon way better than the theory of gravity. How can gravity be strong enough to hold the oceans and the atmosphere against the pull of the vacuum of space, but light enough to let a leaf blow freely in the wind? You might say &quot;well that&#39;s because gravity&#39;s effect on a body is related to its mass,&quot; but isn&#39;t that another way of saying &quot;dense things sink and less dense things rise&quot;?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Absolutely, yes.</p>

<p>This is a pretty common tactic that gets used to shut down something legitimate. &quot;Flat Earth&quot; is probably the oldest one. </p>

<p>A newer and much more obvious one, which you referenced, is the anti-vaxxer movement. A guy discovered that a specific vaccine caused intestinal problems in people with autism. An entity which would have been harmed by that information misrepresented his findings as &quot;vaccines cause autism&quot; and then attacked that. They attacked it so loudly and viciously that people actually started taking sides on the non-issue. They reframed the entire discussion and invented a strawman to attack. Now, any criticism or skepticism gets you lumped in with that strawman and attacked mercilessly. </p>

<p>Have you thought about the counter-argument “prevention is better than cure”?</p>

<p>The question then becomes: does this vaccine actually prevent the disease, and with less harm than the cure?</p>

<p>Many popular vaccines (flu shot, for example) don’t even meet the first requirement reliably.</p>

<p>It’s a slippery slope of an argument. If prevention is better than cure, then why stop at vaccinations? What about proactive human genetic engineering? DNA disease profiling, segregating or chemically castrating ‘high risk’ individuals who have been (unverifiably) marked by the state for the good of everyone else?</p>

<p>One might even conclude that “prevention is better than cure” leads logically to Eugenics.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It’s a <em>deductive rhetorical argument</em> that begins with a generalised premise, in direct opposition to the premise of “if it ain’t broke, don’t fix it”.</p>

<p>I mention it because it is commonly used to sum up why vaccination should be considered preferential to reactive medical treatment.</p>

<p>My main point is that preventative measures carry their own risks, particularly if the reasoning for those measures cannot be verified or directly inspected. Vaccines already fall into that category.</p>

<p>Vaccination represents the thin end of the wedge in terms of what is possible if one extrapolates preventative medicine to its logical conclusion.</p>

<p>For the sake of clarity, let me rephrase.</p>

<ol>
<li>“prevention is better than cure”</li>
<li>“if it ain’t broke, don’t fix it”.</li>
</ol>

<p>These are both generalised premises which are the starting point for a deductive rhetorical argument from two opposing perspectives on medical treatment.</p>

<p>For brevity, I just called it an argument.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Vaccines do not fill this bill, end of story.</p>

<p>Agreed. In fact, I was attempting to reinforce that with additional reasoning.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Because conspiracists typically think they&#39;re right because they provide a take on a situation that the professionals have either dismissed or ignored. They think they&#39;re smart for holding that position, and when they notice the rest of the people don&#39;t, it&#39;s because they&#39;re trying to hide something. This is how the majority of conspiracists are born. And in the end, they tend to be idiots. A chain smoking gun wielding Trumpette that believes the Earth is flat because Alex Jones said so really isn&#39;t going to have more stance over all the explorers and researchers that have studied this. But a case of the DNC swaying the vote for Clinton? Well, that&#39;s more likely. The people that deny that have something to gain for denying it. Unless there&#39;s some billion dollar industry behind globe-manufacturers buying lobbyists to push some twisted agenda, then the flat earth crap is just crap.</p>

<p>I can&#39;t help but ask myself; Why is the media suddenly covering these people? There have always been a small percentage of people who actually believe this crap, but why is it news worthy now?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Because the cat is out of the bag and the media is scrambling to make the whole subject/movement seem like a joke.  The mainstream media would not be covering this topic if the amount of people waking up to the spinning ball illusion wasn&#39;t growing exponentially.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Then I see newscasters and pundits lumping flat-earthers together with all conspiracy theorists.  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>They do that with 9/11 or any other false flag event.  It isn&#39;t anything new.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Think the DNC rigged the primary? &quot;Haha I bet you think the earth is flat too, huh?&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It sounds like you are talking about a brainwashed person that can not look at facts and have an opinion for themselves. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Think the official vegas shooting narrative sounds a bit fishy? &quot;You&#39;re no different than the flat earthers and anti vaxers!!!“</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So are you pro spinning ball earth and pro vaccine?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I feel like the whole thing is just another way to discredit anyone who holds an opinion outside of the mainstream narrative.</p>

<p>Thoughts? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;ve been seeing posts like this for almost 4 years since I&#39;ve been researching the subject. 99.9% of the people that make the &quot;FE was put out to discredit all conspiracies&quot; have never even thoroughly researched the subject and most have done almost 0 research at all.  </p>

<p>So are you one that still trusts NASA or do you realize they are liars but still think we live on a spinning ball earth with water stuck to it?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yet there are a few posts today on various conspiracy subs that all speak to Flat Earth theory as being a psyop. Here&#39;s another: <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/C_S_T/comments/844zf7/does_flat_earth_make_the_conspiracy_community/?st=jeqa7qcl&amp;amp;sh=ceec50a4">https://www.reddit.com/r/C_S_T/comments/844zf7/does_flat_earth_make_the_conspiracy_community/?st=jeqa7qcl&amp;amp;sh=ceec50a4</a></p>

<p>The very label &quot;conspiracy theory&quot; is already designed to label people crazy. People like David Icke and Alex Jones have done quite a bit of psyoping to discredit any truthseekers. You&#39;d think they&#39;d be all over Flat Earth theory and such.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>To me it was always very obvious that the &quot;Flat Earth movement&quot; was a CIA disinformation campaign designed to discredit people who question official stories and scientific orthodoxy. What I love most about the &quot;theory&quot; is how Antarctica supposedly surrounds the entire planet, in a giant wall of ice. Yet no one except military has ever hit it... just because they haven&#39;t, which is why we have no photographic evidence for it even though this is 2018 and if this were true there would be countless videos of pilots and sailers running into the edge. Yeah, smart people.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Everybody who ends up believing in flat earth pretty much has the same story.</p>

<p>One day, you&#39;re browsing around the internet, and you come across some article, or video talking about &#39;&#39;(insert reason) proves the earth is not a globe&#39;&#39; etc, etc. You ignore them for some time, until after months go by, and you see more of the videos popping up, you think what the fuck is going on here?  This has got to be a joke...So, you decide to watch a quick video.  In the video, there are certain things mentioned which make sense to a degree, but the fact they&#39;re attached to the &#39;&#39;flat earth&#39;&#39; idea still makes you stray away from it.  So, you begin to look at ways to prove it wrong.  When looking for ways to prove it wrong, you find more answers that lend credence not so much to the earth being flat, but that there are consistency errors in the current heliocentric model of the solar system, and our cosmology.</p>

<p>Where i stand on it is simple.  I dont think the earth is flat.  BUT...after watching plenty of videos, looking up and researching various different experiments that have been done, and even seeing the heliocentric models &#39;&#39;proofs&#39;&#39; used against itself by flat earth enthusiasts, i&#39;ve come to the stance that there is something that is off, but i dont know what.</p>

<p>Perhaps the size of the planet we live on is much larger, or smaller, or something of those sorts, or the earth is round, but we cant leave the upper atmosphere, or whatever--point is, i was into cosmology, relativity, quantum physics and astrophysics and everything space  related for years, and i loved it.  But, after diving deep into info provided about why the &#39;&#39;earth is flat&#39;&#39;, its changed my view on whether or not we have a current model that is correct.</p>

<p>To me, Flat Earth is not a theory...its a device that breaks you out of that way of thinking that what science tells you is 100% fact...because almost all of what science tells us regarding our planet, the solar system, and the universe is completely up in the air, and is still an &#39;&#39;in-the-works&#39;&#39; theory 100%.</p>

<p>So, going off the initial reaction people have when they see something about &#39;&#39;flat earth&#39;&#39;, which is what i stated above--that being &#39;&#39;this has got to be the dumbest shit ive ever heard...&#39;&#39;...that initial reaction is almost universal to everyone when they first see or hear about flat earth, so its become a common thing to say when you hear, see something that is completely unbelievable.</p>

<p>IMO this is what i think.</p>
