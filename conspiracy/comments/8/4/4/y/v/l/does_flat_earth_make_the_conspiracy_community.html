        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>“Flat Earth is a psyop to make the conspiracy community look bad.”   </p>

<p>I’ve heard this reasoning or argument a few times now and I’d like to discuss whether or not it’s true.  </p>

<p>Psyops are  “planned operations to convey selected information and indicators to audiences to influence their emotions, motives, and objective reasoning, and ultimately the behavior of governments, organizations, groups, and individuals.”  </p>

<p>So the theory is, some agency who is afraid of the conspiracy theory community gaining traction or being taken seriously by outsiders, propagates a theory like flat earth among the conspiracy community in order to make the community look bad.  So if an outsider visits a sub like r/conspiracy and sees some posts about flat earth they’ll say, “wow, look at these idiots believing the earth is flat.  I think I’ll just leave now.”</p>

<p>There are a couple things wrong with this line of reasoning.  First of all, no agency cares whatsoever about the conspiracy theory community and how it looks to the outside world.  It is naive to think that by “red pilling” your friends and family you are going to bring about change within the world at large.  One could make the argument that the conspiracy theory movement as a whole is the psyop, and every single theory presented is just one small mission within the greater operation.</p>

<p>Look at 9/11 and the amount of theories that surround that event.  Anyone with half a brain can tell that the official story is a lie.  It’s naive to think that the government doesn’t know the story looks like a lie as well.  After all, these are the same masterminds that pulled of 9/11 to begin with.  What the government or deep state or Illuminati (so many names for the same agency) rely on is the fact that most of the population will buy the official story right away without questioning.  Then, because no clear evidence is gathered and no straight answers are given, those who question the official story are free to come up with their own theories.  I’ve lost track of all the different theories that exist now, from DEWs to mini thermo nukes to holo planes etc.  At the bottom of every theory is more questions than answers, more confusion, and most importantly, more details to disagree on.</p>

<p>The conspiracy community already looks dumb to the outside world.  For an agency to decide to release a psyop such as flat earth would mean that the community as a whole was coming to a consensus on some massive truth that just couldn’t be allowed to come out.  What would that truth be?  Chemtrails, vaccinations, GMOs, interdimensional alien vampires, pizzagate, reptilians, NAZI space invaders, on and on and on.  Which one is it?  If you latch onto pizzagate as your answer, you must realize that this current iteration of the flat earth movement began well before pizzagate.  </p>

<p>If anything, the flat earth movement is a psyop against those who question the shape of the earth as we are told. The flat earth theory is disruptive to the new religion of our times, Science.  If people start questioning the shape of the earth what’s next?  Evolution, gravity, heliocentrism, carbon dating, space, dinosaurs, the big bang, life, death, pretty much everything we have been told since our first day in kindergarten.  If enough people start to question modern reality as told by science, what would happen?</p>

<p>If you think the flat earth community is making conspiracy theorists look bad I’m afraid you have an inflated sense of value in the conspiracy theory movement.  The conspiracy movement is nothing more than disinfo mixed with good info to such a degree that no firm conclusions can be made by a general consensus.  What’s leftover is confusion and disagreement.  The biggest conspiracy theory producer of them all is in Langley, VA.  As long as you are confused they are happy. </p>

<p>People love this quote.  They use it to validate whatever their biases are.  Try making a post about Flat Earth and see how it goes.  You will quickly learn that it is not allowed.</p>

<p>Just remember, if you think the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/C_S_T/comments/4scop0/if_the_earth_is_rotating_at_nearly_1037_mph_and/">Earth is a ball spinning at 1000 mph, traveling 66000 mph around the sun, in a solar system that is moving 500,000 mph through a galaxy that is moving 67 million mph through space</a>, you accept these “facts” solely on belief because someone told you so.  </p>

<p>Good to see you admit your ignorance... even if in a dickish round about way...</p>

<p>The world was measured by hand. Around 500 years ago survey crews used a 66&#39; chain some stakes and a theodolite to parcel land for taxation. They started in Britain. Used the median low tide for 0&#39; and went to town. This data is available to all. </p>

<p>Heres a good intro to how to figure out the Earth is not flat. </p>

<p>Why does the sun move through the sky at the rate of 15 degrees every hour regardless of where you are on the planet? That right there is not possible on a FE. </p>

<p>Why can I see the sun rise from below the horizon and cast a shadows under the clouds first thing in the morning? </p>

<p>Why do objects far away becomes obscured and increasing my elevation brings them back into view?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>At 35,000 feet you still can only see theoretically a 4 or 5 degree curvature along the horizon, but what you actually see is even less curved due to refraction of your <a href="https://gyazo.com/ad1abe84bba57d178327a8e9cb68a92d">line of sight</a>. this results in an unnoticeable amount to the naked eye.</p>

<p>Why does the horizon stay eye level regardless of altitude? </p>

<p>It doesn&#39;t, but the massive size of the earth makes it appear so. Assuming a visibility of 500 miles on a flight at 35,000 feet the horizon is only &#39;off&#39; by single digit degrees, again without factoring in refraction which curves your line of sight closer to the earth, reducing the change in the horizon? this result in, again, an un-perceivable change to the naked eye.</p>

<p>How are there no locks on the Suez canal?</p>

<p>Because it is a canal connecting one sea to another through flat terrain. Locks are used to move water/boats between differing elevations(sea level doesn&#39;t really change that much, especially over just 100 miles, and tidal changes would be equivalent at both ends of the canal. Locks were used for the panama canal because it would have been absurdly expensive to dig the whole canal at sea level due to the terrain.</p>

<p>Eratosthenes got a fairly good estimate of the circumference of the Earth 2000 years ago, so its not like a round earth a new concept.</p>

<p>Let me clarify. They do not care what you are talking about. None of the ideas presented here are dangerous. You are the product.  If you are not showing enough signs of being isolated and confused, they will add to the noise. So in that sense they care what is presented.   Also, they need to keep fresh material coming to keep you entertained/entrained. Better to have you in front of a screen where they can control what you&#39;re seeing than out in the world talking to people. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>First, let me apologize for the condescending tone of my comment. Second, magnets work because of the alignment of the up/down unpaired electrons in magnetized materials. Sometimes all it takes is a small electric current to align these electrons in a way that cause a magnetic field, and it is the interaction(force) between these electrons that creates said field.</p>

<p>My understanding of gravity is that it&#39;s the relation between the masses of two objects and the distance between them.</p>

<p>F(grav) = G*(m1+m2) /r<sup>2</sup> where G is the gravitational constant(I can provide a proof G if you&#39;re interested).</p>

<p>I&#39;d be interested in your source for gravity being a consequence of the curvature of spacetime and not the other way around. It is my understanding that gravity is the cause of the curvature of spacetime.</p>

<p>Lastly, I&#39;d like to point out that the Higgs-boson particle was suspected to exist for almost 50 years before it was actually measured in a large hadron collider. I assume the same could hold true for dark energy/matter. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yep. The Flat Earth is so easy to disprove that it&#39;s actually laughable. </p>

<ul>
<li>Pick a star on the celestial equator.</li>
<li>Calculate the angular difference between your chosen star and Polaris (use Sigma Octantis if you&#39;re in the South). </li>
<li>It&#39;s going to be 90 degrees. Move south (or north) until you reach the equator. Keep track of the change in angle as you go. It won&#39;t change throughout your movement. </li>

<p>For this to be true on a Flat Earth, stars must be at multiple different altitudes at the same time. Including ground level. </p>
