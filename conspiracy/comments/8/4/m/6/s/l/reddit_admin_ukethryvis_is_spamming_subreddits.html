        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>The admin first posted to <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/television/comments/84972t/slightly_ot_help_reddit_find_you_content/">Television</a> the mods have since removed the post, user were not so welcoming, but the best post on the matter is posted below written by aYearOfPrompts</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Hi! What do you mean bring us more of that content? Do mean continued catering to the handful of power users/marketers that drive the discussion on this sub/site? Or mods, admins, and your advertising partners deciding what gets through to the subs, or what? Shouldn&#39;t we, the community, be determining what shows up here via our upvotes and downvotes? You don&#39;t bring us content. That&#39;s not how reddit works, no? It&#39;s a community driven forum, or at least it always has been. We find something we&#39;re interested in then bring it here to discuss with others. What exactly are you planning to turn reddit into?</p>

<p>Nothing in that survey was even about content. It was all questions about our social media usage and viewing platforms of choice. How does this survey in any way make the subreddit/website better? What are you expecting to actually do with this data? How does the data you are collecting directly translate into a better reddit experience? And i don&#39;t mean the PR buzzspeak answer, but an actual 1:1 translation of &quot;questions A and B provide us with information L and M which we&#39;ll use to produce X and Y.&quot;</p>

<p>The language you used to make this post and the questions asked in that survey don&#39;t feel very community and user oriented. It feels like marketing, and as if you suddenly fancy yourselves as content producers instead of the simple platform for communication you&#39;ve always been.</p>

<p>Can you please expand on the purpose of this survey and where you think the subs you posted this survey on are going to be headed in the future? I&#39;d like to know if you&#39;re about to pull a Digg 4.0 and hand the whole shebang over to power users and corporations instead of the organic community so I know if I want to continue contributing to this discussion forum</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The admin then responds with a completely stupid response</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Hey there! Our community creates better content than anyone else out on the internet (something I firmly believe or I wouldn&#39;t be here!), and we’re not about to mess with that. My title was probably pretty bad and I apologize for that. I can’t give you question-by-question answers, but what I can tell you is that this survey is more to ensure that you can find the content you’re looking for (think more along the lines of subreddit discovery, not dictating what actual content you see), both in posts and in the advertising that runs around it. We’re not looking to change anything around content creation; you guys create it and curate it better than anyone else could.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This place is absolutely data mined as is. </p>

<p>More so than average social media sites imo. Not only data mining, but full blown real-time propaganda, or brainwashing across all platforms. No matter how subtle it is. It leaks into mainstream across sites, in how they feed each other in various niches. Football Conspiracy Politics Memes etc reddit&gt;fb&gt;ig...</p>

<p>I’d bet half the larp fe sr type post are exactly this. They are looking for <em>believers.</em> Thier business is selling/controlling points in any topic. To achieve that, they need a known target base, that is easily swayed in the first place, on top of the normal numbers. </p>

<p>Reddit it’s soul, there is no question about it. The users are now being targeted via direct access. This survey was most likely just what you said, data mining. </p>
