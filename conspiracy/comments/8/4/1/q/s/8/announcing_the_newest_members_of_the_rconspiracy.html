<p>JFK and 9/11 are my 2 favorite conspiracies to dive into. There are so many moving parts to both, and both ushered in new eras of the deep state. The deeper you go on either one, the more fascinating they become in so far as how both were pulled off, and what a pivotal, societal shaping event each became. </p>

<p>My favorite overall conspiracy stuff is anything dealing with space. I eat that shit up. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Just because we seem to be complete opposites on every current political conspiracy doesn’t mean I’ve never(or rarely) said anything of merit, just nothing you’ve agreed with.</p>

<p>Beyond that however, ancient tech and civilizations is what I cut my conspiracy teeth on.  I learned to read not too long before I started to devour Graham Hancock and Andrew Tomas type books.  I love that stuff, but I’m nowhere near as well versed in it as I used to be.  When those topics pop up I generally upvote and read everything presented because I love different perspectives, but I rarely contribute because I have little to add except for maybe something tiny here and there.  </p>

<p>The current political threads, however, dominate this sub and are like conspiracy fast food.  I’m terrible at controlling my diet so of course I feast on those.  I honestly think this sub should consider post tags/flair and a method of sorting them, though I’m not sure how difficult it would be to implement.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have my moments.  These days it&#39;s few and far between due to the constant barrage of politics.  Those topics are like fast food and it&#39;s hard not to indulge, especially when a lot of other people resort to the lowest effort contributions in them so it takes just as little effort to join in.  I&#39;m not deriding my other sub users, I&#39;m just saying we all fall prey to the kind of mentality where people feel truth resides in who can be the snarkiest and most bias-confirming.  </p>

<p>People here want to fight, they thrive on it.  They seem to feel this rush when they &quot;win&quot; a debate or argument online, kind of like how people refer to getting a dopamine hit from various stimuli.  And it&#39;s so much easier to argue and trade insults with people that disagree with you, because it takes so much less energy than coming to the realization that maybe you&#39;re not 100% correct and need to reassess your preconceived notions.  That&#39;s why those other topics don&#39;t take hold as much the political ones; there&#39;s no fight in them.  They don&#39;t grab the attention of people looking for their quick fix, so they tend to get way less comments and interest than the fast food political fare where you can pick a side and hurl shit at others.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not saying I&#39;m any better, at least much of the time.  I fall victim to the same stuff all the time, and I&#39;m sure I fall on many troll/shill lists because of my comments here fall under the same level of snark I previously mentioned.  That seems to get the karma and I&#39;m sure we&#39;re all aware of how an upvote, a like, a retweet, whatever, can feel.  </p>

<p>Meh, I&#39;m ranting now.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Doesn&#39;t matter.  Once you realize the limo stopped, you can see the scope and scale of the operation.    </p>

<p>Before you know the limo stopped:  Maybe it was the CIA, or maybe military intelligence, or who knows.    </p>

<p>After you know----  It was everyone.  Military + CIA carried out the attack.  Primary attackers were snipers squads consisting of anti-castro cubans, italian mafia hitmen, with US mil snipers as backup 3rd team (not used, mafia got the killshot, from highway overpass).  SS involved to stop car (if needed (and it was) to get killshot), and speed away with the evidence.  FBI used to silence witnesses..... limited hang-out was that cubans did it, and they don&#39;t want to start WWIII.    </p>

<p>Backup plan was to nuke Dallas if all snipers failed, and blame it on Russia.    </p>

<p>Oswald was a patsy.  Wanna-be special ops guy.  Too smart.  Didn&#39;t make the grade to be green beret, couldn&#39;t get into any other special op group, but military intelligence decided to use him as a spy.  Had him fake-defect to Russia.  Came back to America with a russian wife and some radar array plans he stole.  Infiltrated communist groups in America.  Ended up a being an asset of both FBI and CIA.  Was sent on a mission to Dallas to prevent a presidential assassination.  On the morning of the assassination, an anonymous telex (which should be impossible) was sent to the FBI&#39;s Dallas field office, warning of an assassination attempt.  I think Oswald sent this telex, and I think he sent it because he already knew he was being set up, and wanted to try to actually succeed in his fake mission.    </p>

<p>The only mystery left for me is WHY.  There are plenty of possible answers.  Kennedy&#39;s presidential order to abolish the CIA.  Bay of pigs.  Various other conspiracy theories.    </p>

<p>Personally, the one I believe is that the &quot;Deep State&quot; were fucking furrious at how Kennedy ended the missile crisis.....  Pubic view was that America was firm, and Russia backed down.  But in reality, Kennedy made concessions.  Reasonable ones, I would say.  He got NATO allies to move strategic missile launchers away from the borders of Russia (which was the whole reason Russia wanted missiles in cuba to begin with).  The 4-stars didn&#39;t like that at all.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I personally think one of the most important conspiracies at the moment has been the steady erosion of our civil liberties under Bush &amp; Obama, and those powers are now in the hands on some one who can barely manage a Twitter account.  The rule of law has been dying for decades, leaving the US ripe for a dictator to take over, I&#39;m just not sure how Trump plays into all of this.  The weird part is you don&#39;t hear his opposition pointing out the BS powers Bush &amp; Obama gave Trump.  Crickets.  I also like the AI / Job Apocalypse theory. </p>

Since when does a conspiracy subreddit need a private conclave where they get to make all of the decisions with zero transparency? Even if you completely agree with it, this just looks shady as fuck. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Three popes have died within a year; foul play has not been eliminated. The Vatican is in total chaos. Cloistered for more than two months, the conclave of cardinals is gripped by discord and indecision.</p>

<p>But, on the seventy-ninth day, white smoke finally appears above the Sistine chapel. For the first time in one thousand years, a layman—from the United States—will lead the church. Before the smoke clears, it is obvious the papacy, and the world, will never be the same.</p>

<p>I actually agree with you - this <em>should</em> be considered a progressive space. And yet, again and again, I see people who espouse non-conservative views driven out or straight up banned for their progressive comments.</p>

<p>Not big into back channels, but I can see why they wouldn’t go through regular channels given the surrounding hysteria.</p>

<p>Flynn called Kislyak to discuss non escalation and that transcript was basically used to perjury trap him.</p>

<p>Don’t pretend like the MSM and a large part of the general public has been calm and reasoned in the Russia Gate theorizing this whole time.</p>

<p>If collusion is proven then ok we can go from there, but reporting around it is sensationalized and one sided.</p>

<p>Mueller asked routine questions to interviewees and the headlines were “Mueller is closing in on Trump: here’s why”.</p>

<p>Truth is people made up their minds a long time ago and if Mueller turns up nothing collusion wise it won’t matter to the people that are already convinced he’s guilty.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well Manafort is going down for his lobbying-money laundering, that’s pretty obvious. But unless that’s tied to collusion than it doesn’t mean anything for Trump.</p>

<p>I’ve never been unwilling to entertain that people like Manafort May have sought to leverage their relationship with Trump for personal gain in the future.</p>

<p>But from the get go it’s been “Trump’s a puppet and there was quid pro quo collusion.” I’ve never believed that and I still don’t. If Mueller presents concrete evidence to the contrary I’ll accept it. I’d be disheartened for what it would mean for our country, but I’d accept it.</p>

<p>My point on Flynn and the Seychelles was a non back channel communication was used to perjury trap Michael Flynn so yeah I can kind of understand a back channel being preferable to being grilled over any form of communication, regardless of content of the discussion.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah I know about that. It just doesn’t mean anything to me. The government didn’t shut down Wikileaks after the emails started coming. Absolutely any campaign would’ve used the Wikileaks emails. Is it ethical? No. Is it quid pro quo with Putin? Also no.</p>

<p>If after all this the “collusion” turns out to be a couple people exchanged twitter DMs with Wikileaks then I think most Americans would view this whole thing as a farce.</p>

<p>The story for 16 months has been Trump is a Russian puppet since there was a quid pro quo for Putin’s assistance to get him elected. If they don’t demonstrate that or something equally significant than our “journalism” takes another embarrassing hit to its credibility.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Once again, a meeting is exposes that helps prove there was no collusion.  If there was collusion, why are they only setting up a meeting to supposedly try to establish back channel communications immediately before the inauguration?  Did trump and Russia collude to steal the election after it happened?</p>

<p>This is the third time a meeting has been trotted out as a &quot;smoking gun&quot;.  Remember the Smith meeting?  It was obvious evidence of collusion.  Yet after about a 10 days of &quot;traitor&quot; and &quot;collusion&quot; and mountains of hyperbole, it was never mentioned again.  Then Trump Jr&#39;s meeting was a smoking gun, until it wasn&#39;t.  Now this one. Has there ever been a recent administration that doesn&#39;t have back channel communications with Russia and other major nations?  </p>

<p>Not to mention this gem from an anti-trump article: &quot;...an apparent move to shield their pre-inauguration discussions from monitoring. &quot;</p>

<p>Well no shit, when powerful political factions supported by the administration still in power want to risk WW3 with Russia over some retarded attempt to make Syria an extremist hell-hole.  Keep in mind that this meeting was just before the inauguration.  A little late to collude with Russia to steal the election, but perfect timing if you plan to deescalate in Syria and stage regime change of your neocon enemy&#39;s BFF.</p>

<p>If they werr <strong>so right</strong> it shouldn&#39;t have been so hard to demonstrate.  The evidence provided consisted of comments critical of the hysteria surrounding the MSM&#39;s version of events and comments regarding the distrusting of major political parties in general.</p>

This is the same RFMN who one comment later says they were already banned once for trolling the sub and trying to find clever ways to break the rules.

If the establishment really wanted to get Trump on colluding with a foriegn entity to influence the election, look no further than Cambridge Analytics who actually brags about influencing our election, but MSM apparently doesn&#39;t want to focus on that.  We can beat that horse all day long, but ultimately neither of our opinions are going to effect the out come of Muellers investigation, so we&#39;ll see what happens.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes &amp; no, I personally don&#39;t think ones point of view should dictate how I or anyone else mods.  If you want to talk about any conspiracy topic, so be it and the community should decide by votes (how reddit once was).  With that said, no one should be an outright dick, whether to you or anyone else.  People are going to disagree and argue, but I don&#39;t think attacking the individual does anything besides show how weak their view point is.  I have a strong background in argueing against  subs being taken over with a political bias and I completely understand your concerns.  I can only offer my promise to be an impartial and non bias mod when it comes to moderating.  Sorry I can&#39;t offer more, didn&#39;t exactly ask for this position, but whole heartedly accept it as a long time member of this community.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think my favorite part of that post is the comment from <a href="/u/CelineHagbardPosts">/u/CelineHagbardPosts</a> that pretty much states outright that the mods don&#39;t care about people who are not members of their little private club sub:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I get that, yet at the same time, where is this backlash going to come from? Since this latest round of invites, I&#39;d say most of the old-time and good users are here, and the ones that aren&#39;t I would think mostly would trust this group, at least with having a slightly stronger voice in terms of moderation.</p>

<p>Yes, we&#39;ll get backlash from the usual suspects of TMOR and r/politics, and probably some manufactured dissent from seemingly real users, but I&#39;m not sure how this could really be perceived as bad from regular users who are aware of the problems of this sub.</p>

<p>The best part of this whole thing is that you people still haven&#39;t figured out that calling people Nazis isn&#39;t winning you a single fucking thing.  They just keep doubling down and expecting different results.  Isn&#39;t there some famous quote about repeating the same behavior and expecting different results?</p>

<p>I still believe that leftist ideology is the majority opinion on Reddit and the majority doesn&#39;t need protecting, as evidenced on Reddit the leftist have free reign in 99.9% of all subs but they aren&#39;t happy with it.  No they want to ban TD and ban Conspiracy, nevermind the 800 anti-trump resistance subs that are the REAL problem on Reddit.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>And I totally disagree, but at least everyone knows where you stand. Enough of this cloak-and-dagger stuff we&#39;ve seen here today. Get it out in the open so there&#39;s no pretense of neutrality. That&#39;s one thing I kind of respect about T_D; it&#39;s a place to be with other like-minded people and they&#39;re not there to have their opinions challenged. It&#39;s a private club and they can do what they want. For that same reason they should put you back on the mod list, maybe do something like &quot;ban MSM sources&quot; (it&#39;ll only be applied ideologically), maybe only allow stuff from approved commentators, and/or maybe only allow certain topics. Since this sub&#39;s explosion the last couple years, maybe have a splash screen when people go to sub that says &quot;We don&#39;t believe Russia did anything wrong&quot;, or something like that, just so new users that come here expecting info on the Russian thing know that this isn&#39;t the place for that.</p>

<p>Nobody said it did. But it was incredibly incorrwect and a gross characterization of reality - so I&#39;ll certainly call it out.</p>

<p>Either way, maybe you shouldn&#39;t be threatening moderation in reply to a comment that wasn&#39;t rulebreaking?  Do you not understand how inappropriate that is?</p>

<p>That&#39;s even disregarding the moderation he already experienced was complete horseshit.  You asked for sources and then ban the dude for it.</p>

<p>He made a claim.  You <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/841qs8/announcing_the_newest_members_of_the_rconspiracy/dvnf9kh/">deleted his highly-upvoted comment</a>, saying you would reinstate it if he could source the claim.  You even gave him permission - &quot;Feel free&quot;.  You even encouraged him - &quot;Off you go!&quot;.</p>

<p>He posted his sources, as you requested.  For his troubles, you removed the post, despite being exactly what you asked for, gave permission for, and encouraged him to make.  Then, on top of that, you didn&#39;t reinstate his original post in adherence with the terms <em>you</em> outlined.</p>

<p>But sure... he didn&#39;t get censored.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah I wasn&#39;t under the impression it was a democratic or community involved policing thing, more like the UK is now. You don&#39;t get to complain. All these hurt people from the mean mods are all wrapped up in one way or another with politics, hence the situation. </p>

<p>They are welcome to start their own sub, and they have - there are a bunch of them. So I think they just really like conflict and the feeling of power, which is sociopathic behaviour imho.</p>

<p>we&#39;re all going to have to take your word for it that you&#39;re being censored here and the only way to fix it is to have mods that are anti trump.</p>
