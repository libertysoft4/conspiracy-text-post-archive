        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>With the recent escalations between Israel and Iran/Syria around the Golan Heights area, I&#39;m remembering an old prediction made back last year or so of a top US military psychic remote viewer who I think if I recall correctly predicted Superbowl wins and other sports stuff I don&#39;t pay attention to, aside from that interest in psychic phenomena and stuff like that.</p>

<p>The basic gist of it is he predicted the world escalating into WW3 sometime in June 2018 due to escalations between Iran and Israel, so recent events made my curious. I can&#39;t remember the sources but can anyone back me up here?</p>

<p>Here&#39;s to cooler heads prevailing, Israeli white hats and the good guys behind the scenes doing what they can to tame their country&#39;s recent aggression down a bit, and the warhawks calling for war with Iran to get tamed. Can&#39;t have a better world if it gets nuked to shit if America goes to war with Russia and China over Syria.</p>

<p>May good prevail over the evil of this world and for you all to live the best lives you can no matter the temptations of the pains and traumas of this particularly fucked up and cruel world. Peace be with you all.</p>

<p>The next war is going to be really bad. It&#39;s not going to be about territory. It&#39;s going to be about race vs race, religion vs religion vs atheism, freedom vs socialism and nationalism vs globalism.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m fearing and expecting a civil war in the United States as well, but if there&#39;s any reconciliation, the US is never gonna be majority any race, it&#39;s a cultural melting pot shaped by the migrations patterns of the world and based on who&#39;s able to make it to America, and there&#39;s socialists who are fighting for freedom too. I have faith eventually people aren&#39;t gonna be thinking in terms of capitalism or socialism or any other dumb -isms and will just try to find out what works better than the current banking and money heirarchies, which I believe will require a lot of decentralization, but still need organization for the sake of greater humanity, of which that system would look like, I don&#39;t know.</p>

<p>Easier to just say the powers that be want to divide every by every possible way that they can, and I&#39;ve seen a couple of your posts and the way you talk about Hispanics and blacks plays right into the narrative of the powers that be if you ask me. Everyone&#39;s gotta unite and stand against the evils of this world if anything&#39;s gonna get better. Race and religious differences need to stop being ways to divide.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m going to leave it at this, because you are clearly very locked into your perception of reality and I know that there is little I can say to shake you out of that, but you should really try interacting with those who are different than you.</p>

<p>I think you&#39;ll find that there are many more things that make humans similar than differences caused by where they were brought up, or the color of their skin.</p>

<p>Why is the color of our skin the most important / most defining feature of our being? Is it not our thoughts, our dreams, our hopes for a brighter future?</p>

<p>I&#39;m a white guy who grew up in a very small town, but throughout life I have been lucky enough to live in a completely foreign country in the Middle East, and cosmopolitan metropolises in North America. Believe me, I have experienced culture shock many times, so I can sort of remember the incomplete reality that I lived in before when I thought there were just white people, black people and asian looking people.</p>

<p>You gotta get out of your small town and explore the world my friend. Meet it&#39;s people, enjoy their hospitality, eat their food, love their women (or men if that&#39;s your thing). Existence is a lot brighter when you joint the planetary tribe.</p>

<p>Think big. Bigger than your narrow view of reality. Violence and hatred beget violence and hatred. If that&#39;s all you see everywhere you look, that&#39;s all you&#39;ll manifest.</p>

<p>Anyways, hope that at least sparked SOME cognitive dissonance for you.</p>

<p>You mean like living in another country, going to a plurality black and White school and having multiple bad business dealings with black people? Because I&#39;ve done all of that.</p>

<p><a href="https://imgur.com/a/NAikhxy">Do you celebrate diversity or do you destroy diversity?</a></p>

<p>If everyone is the same, which is what you want, there will be no other country to go to and there will be no reason to go anywhere else because it&#39;s all going to be the same.</p>

<p>I believe in true diversity, which is blue, red, green, yellow, white, orange and black. All unique colors that stand out on their own. What you want are 15 shades of brown which are borderline indistinguishable from each other.</p>

<p>People like you think you support diversity. What you support is homogeneity. Your idea of diversity is completely ass backwards.</p>

<p>The Middle East needs to be the Middle East. Africa needs to be Africa and China needs to be China. They need to be left alone to perish or prosper without interference.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Think big.</p>

<p>Imagine what America would be like if the 12% of the population that commits 52% of the crime were gone? Imagine what we could build if the group of 57 million people with 80%+ of them being on welfare weren&#39;t here? Imagine if various degeneracies like homosexuality, miscegenation, alcohol abuse and drugs weren&#39;t allowed? Imagine a world where we can live in communities where our kids could feel safe to go outside and play and we didn&#39;t have to lock our doors at night? Imagine a world where we knew all of neighbors and lended each other a helping hand due to being free from the chains of multi-culturalism? Imagine a world where people were pushed to be the best possible people they could be with family being the model for the state?</p>

<p>That&#39;s the type of world I imagine. It doesn&#39;t get any bigger or better than that.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>A majority, in terms of demographics, is the group that makes up about 50&amp;#37; or more of a given nation&#39;s population. Which it&#39;s currently majority white so I fucked up being precise there, but migration patterns due to climate change in Latin America may change that. A border wall built will just be a waste of money, where there&#39;s a will there&#39;s a way and not wanting to die or starve to death is a pretty good motivator.</p>

<p>The wealth remaining in an Emrica, in an ideal situation, should be spread more equally to prevent abuses of power as a result of that wealth.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>All psychics and remote viewers can do is predict a probable future based on the coalescing of energies currently present.</p>

<p>In other words, they can tune into the global psyche of all beings on this planet (the collective consciousness) and ultimately the collective consciousness of the All (since the entire Cosmos is one intertwined matrix) and &quot;read&quot; the collective intentions and with it the future pathways of them, which is directly correlated to the unfolding of events on this planet and our society.</p>

<p>But all of these things - the intentions, thoughts, corresponding actions and thus the eventual unfolding of events can always change. The habitual patterns are the train tracks we are on, the collective timeline, mostly unconscious and on auto pilot. This we can call karmic destiny. </p>

<p>But apart from that, there is free will, which is essentially the opposite of an unconscious auto-pilot unfolding of things. We can all access by being aware, of ourselves, our thoughts, emotions, intentions and actions - and with that our destiny starts ever so slightly shifting. The course moves ever so slightly the more aware you are. At that point your own destiny and free will come together in a divine symphony of creation. And as this is the case with you, the individual, so it is with the All and thus the totality of humanity.</p>

<p>Awareness literally equals free will and the more free will you can exert, the more the probabilistic predictions made by these psychics based on a certain past energy, become obsolete. </p>

People can do good things and people can do evil things. Subjective perception dictates how you see morality and viewing this colorful spectrum of possibilities in such a black and white manner causes devides and hatred.</p>
