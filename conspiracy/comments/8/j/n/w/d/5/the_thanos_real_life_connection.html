        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>So if you&#39;ve heard of avengers which i&#39;m sure you have, you know that Thanos wants to take out half of the universe. Now his reasoning behind this is overpopulation. His ideology is &quot;In perfect balance as all things should be&quot;. There are not enough resources in the universe to cater for the amount of beings and he wants to kill half of them for the greater good. </p>

<p>Now i searched on Youtube &quot;is Thanos the good guy&quot;, and a couple of videos came up :</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Ng9J9jq-F0">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Ng9J9jq-F0</a></p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIDXqtlEWLo">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIDXqtlEWLo</a></p>

<p>Now majority of comments seem to agree with the ideology that Thanos is the good guy with comments such as &quot;Thanos is right. Actual villain in the movie is overpopulation&quot; &quot;After watching the movie I really see Thanos viewpoint and the sacrifice he has to make to save the universe.﻿&quot; &quot;Thanos for President﻿&quot; </p>

<p>People are agreeing with the concept that Thanos is the good guy. There are not enough resources in the universe and this will cause more suffering for EVERYONE. Overpopulation is a problem. You have to make sacrifices in life. And unless its not presented in a real life situation, people will agree. again &quot;Thanos for President﻿&quot;.</p>

<p>Now i want you to apply this concept in real life. Imagine there was a being out there that has been working for centuries to reduce this planet to 500 million, just as the Georgia stones state: </p>

<p>Maintain humanity under 500,000,000 in perpetual balance with nature.
Guide reproduction wisely — improving fitness and diversity.
Unite humanity with a living new language.
Rule passion — faith — tradition — and all things with tempered reason.
Protect people and nations with fair laws and just courts.
Let all nations rule internally resolving external disputes in a world court.
Avoid petty laws and useless officials.
Balance personal rights with social duties.
Prize truth — beauty — love — seeking harmony with the infinite.
Be not a cancer on the earth — Leave room for nature — Leave room for nature.</p>

<p>This is what is going to happen in real life my fellow friends. The new world order. The Satan worshipping elite are going to reduce this planet to 500 million. Evil = Greater good and unless it doesn&#39;t pose a threat to your life you will agree. World war 3, vaccines, weather modification, Gmo etc... Overpopulation is a problem and this is part of the New World Agenda.</p>

<p>And from what i can see in those comments, you agree. It&#39;s time to wake up guys. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not all of us agree. It only seems like overpopulation because there are too many people in the cities that are already built. But theres is thousands of square feet of miles left of land to be built on and plenty of resources to go around for everyone.

    <div class="md"><p>Air CO2 levels aren&#39;t the problem. It&#39;s the massive massive amounts of CO2 that the oceans absorbs. This creates oxygen dead spots and acidification. This kills ocean life. When the phytoplankton goes, krill goes and shortly thereafter everything else goes. </p>

<p>The second problem with a warming planet is the enormous methane deposits trapped beneath frozen ground (permafrost). Whatever greenhouse gases we produce now is miniscule compared to the methane that&#39;s in process of being released. 400ppm of CO2? That&#39;s not the big problem. It&#39;s the methane. When it pops, we&#39;re gone quick. </p>

<p>Right now the greatest threat to mankind is the declining population of the 1<sup>st</sup> world because that&#39;s where all the knowledge, power, and capital is.

    <div class="md"><p>True, because &quot;climate change&quot; is <em>extremely</em> hard to predict or analyze reliably. Trying to determine the outcome of record-breaking CO2 levels is actually really hard. It is probably bad, but how bad? Scientists disagree.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There is a <em>lot</em> of speculation about climate change out there. Much of it gets reported as fact by news sources, without the proper context.</p>

<p>Elevated CO2 levels are, will, and MUST cause ocean acidification. This damages coral reefs, inhibits plankton growth, and reduces atmospheric oxygen, which is really bad. It also inhibits fish and other marine life, which we depend on for food.</p>

<p>The temperature aspect of climate change is far less well understood. CO2 does act as a greenhouse gas, trapping heat near Earth. But elevated temperatures will cause global humidity increases, which will cause more clouds to form, reflecting some significant amount of sunlight. This will have a cooling effect.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t study climate science for a living, so I don&#39;t have the research to confirm or deny global warming. But CO2 emission is undeniably bad</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Limited resources in an infinite universe?  Serious plot hole right there.</p>

<p>This movie isnt about the universe, its about Earth and the people that think they own it and feel justified in reducing the population for the greater good.</p>

<p>This movie is predictive programming.  They are trying to get the idea into the collective consciousness that killing billions of people is just fine.</p>

<p>But who wants to live in a world with only sociopaths left in it?  I mean, you have to be a sociopath to think murdering billions of people is fine.  So if youre chosen to live its because you will have no objections to genocide (because youre a fucking sociopath).  So youll live in a world of people just like you; people that think killing other people is fine as long as it can be justified.  How do you know know youre not going to be next?  </p>

<p>You are all going to be next because all the other sociopaths will be thinking everyone else is a sociopath and ready, willing and able to kill at any time.</p>

<p>So, after the great culling it will only be a matter of a few short years before the &quot;survivors&quot; kill each other off and humans will be extinct. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>When people breed animals for pets, let&#39;s take dogs as an example, they look for animals with desired traits (i.e. doesn&#39;t bite people, protects it&#39;s owner/owners, intelligent, etc) and cull out the rest from the breeding stock so that they don&#39;t pass on their undesired traits. If they didn&#39;t do that we&#39;d still have dogs ripping babies apart when we turn our backs..</p>

<p>There will always be people around who view things in this manner. A lot of people who are this cold and numbed to humanity seem to be very successful and run major companies, are in our government, are in our military, etc.. I guess what I&#39;m getting at, is try  to make sure you have desired traits..</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The infinity war came out in 1992. Guess they have been telling us for awhile. Seriously I understand the connections people are making but Marvel didn&#39;t happen last year and they change so much in movies. My suggestion is to hit up comic stores and start buying old comics online. You will get a better picture of it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Actually, this concept has been brewing for a while and have been used in movies as a supervillain move. Soylent Green, The Thinning, the first Kingsman, they all allude to some sort of purge to balance the universe.</p>

<p>Heck, when you think about it, the Purge also talks a little about balance, but it&#39;s about social justice.</p>
