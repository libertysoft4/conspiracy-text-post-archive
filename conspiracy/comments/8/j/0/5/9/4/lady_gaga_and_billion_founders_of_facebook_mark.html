    <div class="md"><p>I was in GT. Very little memory of doing anything productive. At the time, I came to the conclusion the program was bullshit, a way to fluff the egos of school board members by admitting their very average kids into a &quot;prestigious&quot; program. One of the few things I do remember doing was brainstorming ways to sell a food additive that was known to be harmful (Olestra, it turns out). </p>

<p>I asked him, &#39;Hey man, do you work for the CIA?&#39; (because we had all long suspected it...there was no reason he would be a professor of english in a -stan country...he majored in aeronautics engineering or something)</p>

<p>My guy (who has one of the worst poker faces in the world): Completely shocked expression on his face, like I had just told him his dick was hanging out of his pants, &#39;Uh, well, um...you know, even if I did, I wouldn&#39;t be able to tell you, right?&#39;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was a professional tutor for a long time, but it was still kinda shocking when I saw for the first time that the testing they use for the Johns Hopkins Center for Talented Youth (CTY) is called the SCAT test (school and college ability test).  Something tells me they could have gone with a slightly more innocuous name.  I went to the CTY a while back, and it&#39;s crazy to me that it&#39;s gotten so huge, to the point where they even make test prep books for it!</p>

<p>I tutored a kid that went there two years back because he was getting to the national level of Math Counts and I did that ages ago.  Honestly, he was much smarter than me, and he learned some really interesting tricks and ways to approach problems that I never had seen before.</p>

<p>Not really, and the program is FAR different from student to student. </p>

<p>I went there for a whole summer in a very small class with only a few other students.  And I also didn&#39;t live in a dorm.  The guy who taught my class was actually the guy who originated the program, too. </p>

<p>I will say that the method of instruction was excellent and helped me greatly when tutoring, and I sorely wish that I had gotten more education like it throughout my youth.

Self-discovery is the key to internalizing knowledge, and they were playful with problems and dropped sly hints when needed.  </p>
