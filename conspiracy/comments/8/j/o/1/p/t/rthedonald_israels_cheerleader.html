<p>You&#39;re welcomed to view my post history and make fun of my T_D, conservative, worldnews and libertarian posts (tho the libertarians didn&#39;t really like my independent thinking), but if you look at my first Political posts they are being critical of Trump. </p>

<p>As is any sub that is as high traffic as T_D is.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Not true. There&#39;s a way to be critical of things and the mods will make judgement based on your post history. If you&#39;re not a T_D regular and a regular poster in Anti-Trump subs, such as yourself, there is little to no tolerance against abrasive content.</p>

<p>This is a tool all mods have called shadow banning (I believe).</p>

<blockquote>
<p><a href="/r/the_donald">/r/the_donald</a> is probably the most important piece of influence the zionists have. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>That&#39;s a pretty big assumption. If the people on T_D were high impact or activists in their community, this might be somewhat true. However, the amount of T_D subscribers vs how many people there are in the real world is an incredibly low percentage (600k vs 7.6 billion) makes this statement very &quot;dis-info&quot;ish.</p>

<p>Not sure who you&#39;re referring to as parasites, but if you&#39;re calling Jewish people parasites, thats a big red flag as to the voracity/viability of your opinion.</p>

I&#39;m sorry you can&#39;t see trump boosting the s&amp;p isn&#39;t him boosting the economy, it&#39;s him being pro corporate and expanding the takeover from private institutes. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Damn, you really nailed that one! </p>

<p>Here&#39;s another theory: not all that T_D are neanderthals.</p>

<p>I can send you to all corners of Reddit where there are vile miserable people who only spread hate and make it the key focus of a comment is to try to bash other people. People they don&#39;t know, who they will never meet, just to simply get a few upvotes... internet points.</p>

<p>If you look at my post history and compare it to yours, there are two key differences: good grammar and intent. I have no problems defending myself, but I will not voluntarily attack someone simply to point out how much of a piece of shit I think they are based on zero time actually knowing them.</p>

<p>Not sure why I&#39;m telling you about me though. You know me, right? I am &quot;super immature&quot; (btw, next time leave super out... it makes you sound immature), racist, reactionary, anti-Semitic (even though OP is saying we are Zionists) and anti-Muslim (look up extreme Islamism), support violence against opposing ideals (aka bigot... there are idiots in every sub. Look at the stuff that makes it to 5k+ to see what the &quot;hive mind&quot; agrees with).</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>This sentence make absolutely zero sense. Every government is pro corporate, it&#39;s literally the pulse of the economy. I don&#39;t understand the last part of what you&#39;re saying enough to address it. I can tell you that there is no take over to expand on, particularly one ran by private institutes.</p>

And no, you don&#39;t have to dig far into the donald to see racism and vile hatred. Sorry you&#39;ve cozied up to it, and as far as your boot licking statement on all governements do that, well you&#39;re on a conspiracy forum fucktard. The status quo of governments isn&#39;t our concern, in fact, it&#39;s what we&#39;re actively fighting against. Except you, a chimera of american racism and unchecked confidence has convinced you that you&#39;re doing something with you&#39;re life. If you&#39;re cool with all that, it&#39;s because your value system is tethered to the social engineering of the right. being a supporter of donald gives me the absolute right to classify you to certain things. Also, supporting Israel doesn&#39;t make you not anti-semitic. They buy weapons, along with Saudi Arabia, so we&#39;re cool with them. Of course you will read this comment, feign being a victim, and then try and block yourself with more generilizations. So going forward, I emplore you looking into the art of debating and not get caught up in the prestidigitation of fancy words! </p>

<p>That is your opinion and you&#39;re entitled to it.  Obama disgusted me as much as Bush and Clinton and most Presidents before.  Most politicians are narcissistic, pathological liars.. or the word you&#39;re looking for is Sociopath.  Sociopaths seek positions of authority so they can exercise power over others.</p>

<p>What you need to realize is, America is a spectrum of beliefs, cultures and communities. I don&#39;t agree with a lot of American&#39;s, but I can honor them as a citizen without personally attacking them.  You can criticize their actions (constructively) and help bridge the divide in beliefs or at least gain an understanding for their choice instead of lambasting them as a person.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>This is where you&#39;re wrong.  People are stupid, period.  Not half or some other amount.  Nearly all people are stupid.</p>

<p>From one of my favorite books:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Wizard&#39;s First Rule: people are stupid.&quot; Richard and Kahlan frowned even more. &quot;People are stupid; given proper motivation, almost anyone will believe almost anything. Because people are stupid, they will believe a lie because they want to believe it&#39;s true, or because they are afraid it might be true. People&#39;s heads are full of knowledge, facts, and beliefs, and most of it is false, yet they think it all true. People are stupid; they can only rarely tell the difference between a lie and the truth, and yet they are confident they can, and so are all the easier to fool... People are stupid; they want to believe, so they do.&quot;</p>

<p>Nobody was telling the racists to respect Obama because he&#39;s president.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And they were fools too.  To bridge the divide (created by MSM/TPTB) and finally overthrow our masters we need to put aside the personal vitriol for each other.  Maybe you don&#39;t need to respect the other, but gain a slight understanding.  You really have no idea what life they&#39;ve had and it&#39;s ignorant to think otherwise.  </p>

<p>The thing about Trump is, his Presidency is a phenomenon greater than you realize.  The Trump curse, numerology(Gematria), fulfilling prophecy etc  He is a buffoon and a fool, yes, but he is also much more important in the grand scheme of things.  He&#39;s playing his part in all of this, like every one of us.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>... oh wow I guess I have to break down a single sentence. An argument is composed of two parts: a conclusion and a premise that supports that conclusion. Let&#39;s take a look at my sentence:</p>

Premise: &quot;they share the same stupid ideas&quot; </p>

<p>Because [premise], [conclusion].</p>

<p>Now let&#39;s look at yours:</p>

<p>Conclusion: &quot;you are just plain wrong&quot;
Premise: ??? </p>

<p>&quot;I know you think that&quot; is not a premise that supports your conclusion, it does nothing to attack my conclusion or premise. It&#39;s just an opinion and a dubious one at that (how can you really <em>know</em> what I think?) It&#39;s an informal logical fallacy. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>T_D user here. We come to conspiracy sometimes too. It&#39;s good to hear other points of view. I have read your comments on Israel, and in general disagree with them, but it&#39;s good to hear them. The only place you can make pro-Trump or pro-Israel comments right now without starting a fight is T_D. T_D doesn&#39;t come here and call you all crazy, why try to brigade our sub? We will come here and argue points from time to time (check my posts for today) but a variety of opinions is important. We can disagree on some things (Israel) and agree on others (DNC election rigging, WikiLeaks, etc.). </p>

<p>Absolutely. Look at the Amish. They&#39;ve kept the same traditions, language and ways of life for hundreds of years. They have the same blood and have no reason to fight about racism or who&#39;s rich/poor, because they got rid of those degenerates. They work, pray and live together and when someone needs help, they help because that person helped them at some point. That&#39;s a model community and that&#39;s something I can get behind. They don&#39;t live for themselves, they live for the community. That&#39;s what Whites should be striving for.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Are you American?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes. But studies have shown Hispanics and Asians identify with their race and the country their ancestors came from, not the US.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If so, do you believe that you’d have more in common with a Caucasian Swedish person than a 3rd generation Mexican American or African American?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>My parents and grandparents grew up in an Italian community in the US. Their neighbors were Italian. Their coworkers were mostly Italian. The local stores were Italian and of course they all went to Italian churches. They had much in common so they had little to fight about but they got soft. They stopped speaking their home languages, they stopped going to church so much, people moved and now they are about as Italian as the local Pizza Hut. What they lost is gone forever here and it&#39;s going to take multiple generations of work to get it back.</p>

<p>You realize that’s socialism right? I’ll agree national socialism is not as bad as international socialism, but it’s still socialism. It’s the coercion that’s wrong, the fact you are <em>forced</em> to “live for the community” (or whatever the ruler proclaims to be in the interest of the “community”). Your life is worth less than the herd’s (and the rulers’) comfort.</p>

<p>Both Hitler and Mussolini were prominent socialist statesmen, by the way.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t actually agree with assimilation. I think Italians need to be Italians. I think Africans need to be Africans and Muslims need to be Muslims. I support separatism where every race is free to perish or prosper on their own.</p>

<p>My ideal US would be set up like this:</p>

<p>Native Americans - We will have to work out something for them. They were screwed.</p>

<p>Hawaiians - We would still want to keep a military base there, but they should be given back full control of their country, if they decide they want that. They may not since they benefit a lot from the Mainland US.</p>

<p>For Hispanics - Deportations. Most of them speak Spanish anyway and follow their cultural traditions anyway, so it won&#39;t be too hard for them to go back.</p>

<p>For Blacks:</p>

<p>1) Sterilizations in exchange for no deportations.</p>

<p>2) Paid deportations. We can even work out something with Mexico, The UK, Canada or another country I&#39;m sure if they&#39;d like to go there and since the UK/Canada take in tons of people anyway.</p>

<p>3) Deportations to possibly some kind of area near the border of Mexico where they can perish or prosper on their own. If any Whites/mixed people choose to go there, they will follow the same rules.</p>

<p>Sure it does and it&#39;s silly to suggest otherwise. There&#39;s not a lot of Chinese Mennonites out there. There&#39;s not a lot of Muslim people in South America.</p>

<p>We can trace the origins of all religions.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>America is not a country based on equality or human rights for non-Whites. See the Native Americans and Mexicans if you think otherwise. The founders intended for this country to be White only. Laws did eventually change though and when you establish that laws are not set in stone, they can be changed, removed and abused.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Not a lot of other countries allow its citizens to have the types of guns we have nor allow them such freedoms to purchase them. It is really hard to large numbers of people who are armed without hurting innocent people in the process.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Native&#39;s weren&#39;t allowed to vote until 1924. Blacks weren&#39;t allowed until 1965.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>...what? When has American ever been whites only?</p>

<p>The founding fathers did not consider blacks to be equal people. They also made it a mission to destroy the Natives, which they successfully did.</p>

<p>Natives were moved off American land and subjected to genocide. Blacks were seen as little more than farm animals.</p>

<p>Again, if they thought of them as actual humans, they wouldn&#39;t have killed them nor made them their slaves, would they? Good, that&#39;s the first step into admitting your propaganda and anti-American sentiments.</p>

<p>Liberals are attempting to create a socialist world government where humans exist to serve as slaves for the elites. And the sooner they can convince people like you to let them get rid of the 1st and 2nd amendments, they will be able to take down more until there is no constitution remaining.</p>

<p>As long as I am not doing anything against the law with it and as long as I make sure it is in a safe and secure location, I don&#39;t see the issue. It&#39;s not the weapon, it&#39;s the intent behind the weapon. France banned guns, so people use cars and killed over 130 people. There&#39;s some chemicals out there where a couple pounds of it can kill a whole block.</p>

<p>But there is a wide difference between closing the door altogether and throwing it entirely open; between a postponement of fourteen years and an immediate admission to all the rights of citizenship. Some reasonable term ought to be allowed to enable aliens to get rid of foreign and acquire American attachments; to learn the principles and imbibe the spirit of our government; and to admit of at least a probability of their feeling a real interest in our affairs. A residence of at least five years ought to be required.
If the rights of Naturalization may be communicated by parts, and it is not perceived why they may not, those peculiar to the conducting of business and the acquisition of property, might with propriety be at once conferred, upon receiving proof, by certain prescribed solemnities, of their intention to become citizens; postponing all political privileges to the ultimate term. To admit foreigners indiscriminately to the rights of citizens, the moment they put foot in our country, as recommended in the Message, would be nothing less, than to admit the Grecian Horse into the Citadel of our Liberty and Sovereignty.</p>

<p>Hamilton wasn&#39;t anti-immigrant, he was pro-assimilation.</p>

<p>Regulations in place on guns would be applied to all groups equally. Not the same as your &quot;regulations&quot; on women and non-whites.</p>

<p>Like I said, you have no legitimate reason. And compare the nber of times vehicles are used in public places to the number of times guns are used in public places if you want to try and rehash that &quot;why don&#39;t we ban trucks then?&quot; nonsense.</p>

<p>...you mean segregation? Ah, so that&#39;s what &quot;MAGA&quot; means to you. No more colored folks drinking from the same water fountain, eh?</p>

<p>Or, and hear me out here, or we treat everyone equally because we are all humans! Now there&#39;s a new concept that really has not been tried before.</p>

<p>LOL
Put down the kool-aid and go get some fresh air bud.</p>

<p>As you are trying to justify <em>actual</em> genocide by claiming that white people are under attack because they are reproducing with non-white people? Seriously, there&#39;s no attempts at justification when I tell you that you clearly do not understand your rights.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Native Americans</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Britain, France, The Spanish and The Portugese(IIRC) fucked the Native Americans as did we. If there is ever a group that deserves something in the US, it&#39;s them.</p>

<p>The Native Americans are a great example of what may happen to White Americans if we don&#39;t act soon. Once we are the minority, I firmly believe we will be forced to pay reparations for slavery and will be able to do nothing but watch as the Southwest United States is slowly reconquered by Mexico. There are more poor South/Central Americans than their US citizens and as long as those countries stay poor and as long as South/Central Americans continue to have more kids than they can afford, we will always have millions of them wanting to come here. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Just curious where someone who is heavily mixed would go? I am like four different things</p>

<p>What things are you? </p>

<p>The Germans went back 3 generations to decide who was Jewish and who wasn&#39;t. While some of their methods left much to be desired, this is a decent start, but our science and technology has increased and we can surely do a better job now.</p>

If you went back on my moms side it would put me in Japan. So by your logic should I be in japan? I honestly think that’s a little bizarre because I’m from northern Midwest and I’m learning Chinese, and I learned French and Spanish on school, so I would have a very hard time in japan. Or should I be living in Mexico? I’m married to a white (primarily British/Scottish) man, so where would my child belong once he is an adult and we are dead? </p>

<p>Last question, how would you address the vast differences in living standards between countries? If I were to be forced into Mexico bc of my lineage, I would feel that is unfair. I was born and raised here, I’ve paid taxes, this is my country. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>So by your logic should I be in japan?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You shouldn&#39;t be here period, because we shouldn&#39;t have allowed miscegenation nor immigration from non-European countries. That&#39;s not your fault.</p>

<p>A group of many people with the same bloodline is a family. A group of many families is a community. A group of many communities is a state and a group of many states is a nation.</p>

<p>When you start doing stuff like this:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I’m married to a white (primarily British/Scottish) man, so where would my child belong once he is an adult and we are dead? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>The community has failed. Hundreds of years of history, cultures and traditions flushed down the toilet because people couldn&#39;t resist various temptations.</p>

<p>Your kid will end up as an outcast. They won&#39;t quite be Mexican, so they aren&#39;t going to fit in with that group. They sure as hell aren&#39;t anything else, so they are unlikely to fit into those group either. The best thing you could do is marry another Mexican and turn what would be half Mexican into 3/4th Mexican. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>If I were to be forced into Mexico bc of my lineage, I would feel that is unfair. I was born and raised here, I’ve paid taxes, this is my country. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>The only thing in life that is fair for everyone is that we all die. What we did to the Native&#39;s wasn&#39;t fair. What our politicians have done to this country isn&#39;t fair. Fixing the problem that we have is not going to be done in a fair way either.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Last question, how would you address the vast differences in living standards between countries? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is where you really aren&#39;t going to like what I&#39;m going to say. The average IQ of South and Central America is not very high. Mexico&#39;s system has been failing for a long time and considering they are about to vote in a socialist, I don&#39;t see that changing any time soon.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Okay first: if you’re saying I shouldn’t be here period, then neither should you. Because going back to native Americans, you are not from here and therefore shouldn’t be here. So that’s kind of awkward. Am I following your logic?</p>

<p>Second, I honest to god laughed out loud when you said the community has failed. I think you should expand your mind and think past race. I thought if I showed you that I am mixed and I have a beautiful (maybe I’m biased as his mom but strangers stop me when we are in public and tell me how beautiful he is, they somehow come to the conclusion that he is full Italian...) mixed child that it’s not as big a deal as you’re making it. Race mixing is not a bad thing. No one is being forced to marry outside their race, unless you can show me proof of this that is what I will believe. </p>

<p>I also think you somehow managed to describe what it’s like to be a mixed person. You don’t fit in anywhere, but I still have friends of all races and a family because my race has no impact on any of that. And no, I’m not going to marry a Mexican man lol. Correct me if I’m wrong but Mexicans are the product of Spain (Europeans) colonizing the native population. So isn’t every Mexican mixed anyway? </p>

<p>You still didn’t address my inequality between nations question. If I am a citizen and have lived here my whole life why should I be forced to move somewhere far far worse? Simply because of my skin color or who my parents are? I’m not trying to attack I just fail to see the logic in this. I am a human and if you are going to judge me on my race then I think you need to look inward and ask what makes you and me so different. </p>

<p>Whites have built this country. This is an undeniable fact. Without Whites this country would be the Africa of the West. It&#39;s nothing for the majority of Hispanics to go back to their home countries. They speak the language already for the most part and they will fit right in. Most Hispanics are not assimilating and I&#39;m not even suggesting they should, because assimilation has caused Whites to lose their whole identities - this is the real reason why so many people are unhappy. We feel like we have nothing because we traded it all to assimilate.</p>

<p>I&#39;m willing to make the ultimate sacrifice to fight for this country. The people who are using this country as their shopping mall are not going to be willing to fight. The second shit hits the fan(and it&#39;s going to when the 70% who funds the other 30% become the 40% who fund the other 60%) they will be on the first plane out of here, never to return. Whites don&#39;t have anywhere to go anymore, and we have no choice but to fight. Germany&#39;s being ruined. England&#39;s gone. France is gone. Australia is gone. Italy&#39;s waking up and if you would have told me that Poland and Hungary were the most woke groups in Europe, I don&#39;t think most people would believe you. </p>

<p>If we fight for this country and lose, that&#39;s nothing to be embarrassed about. But if we let this country be invaded through immigration and don&#39;t do a damn thing to stop it, we deserve whatever is coming. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Second, I honest to god laughed out loud when you said the community has failed. I think you should expand your mind and think past race.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The community has failed. My ancestors grew up in an Italian community in the US. Their neighbors were Italian. Their coworkers were mostly Italian. The local stores were Italian and of course they all went to Italian churches. They spoke in Italian. They had much in common so they had little to fight about but they got soft. They stopped teaching their home languages, they had less kids, they started marrying with non-Italians, they stopped going to church so much, people moved and now the community is about as Italian as the local Pizza Hut. What they lost is gone forever here and it&#39;s going to take multiple generations of work to get it back.</p>

<p>This is the game plan for Hispanics and Asians and this has already happened to Blacks.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>There are good looking people of almost every race minus blacks, but if my ancestors intended for me to be non-White, I&#39;d be non-White. Since they are gone and can no longer speak for themselves, I have to speak for them and do my best to carry on their wills. This isn&#39;t about me. This is for them. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Race mixing is not a bad thing.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It is. When two tribes mix, one will always be forced to take the minor role. When you race mix, you change thousands of years of evolution for your own selfish desires.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>No one is being forced to marry outside their race, unless you can show me proof of this that is what I will believe. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>People are certainly being encouraged. Watch some TV. The majority of commercials now feature black/white couples, even though those are only 1 million total in the US. The fucking elites are trying to convince us that a royal family which would have had a brother and sister marry to preserve a line are now okay with blacks being in the royal family. W A K E  U P.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Spain (Europeans) </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Most of us on the far right do not consider Spain to be White. I don&#39;t. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>So isn’t every Mexican mixed anyway? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>I do not know the full history of Mexico, but Mexicans and various Indian groups are almost indistinguishable.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If I am a citizen and have lived here my whole life why should I be forced to move somewhere far far worse? Simply because of my skin color or who my parents are?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We do not care about trying to be fair. White&#39;s fairness is our weakness, hence Hitler once saying he wished Catholicism was at strict as Islam. The only thing that is fair is that we all die and Whites will be dead in the US unless action is taken soon.</p>

<p>Whatever way we have to do it, we have to take this country back.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>ask what makes you and me so different. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>As a whole, Hipsanics and Whites are different in Race, DNA, Average IQ, Looks, Food, <a href="https://i.imgur.com/SLWkpbP.png">Political Stances</a>, <a href="https://imgur.com/a/XmhoaUu">Rates of Government Assistance Usage</a>, Culture, etc. In short, everything.</p>

<p>Importing millions of 3rd world immigrants to become new age slaves who will vote hard left for free gibs which will give TPTB full control over the US.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>I&#39;m sure the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Council_on_Foreign_Relations">Council on Foreign Relations</a> have tacos now and then.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You lost me when you said whites built this country.</p>

<p>Tell me this country would be in the same spot it is now with only Native Americans. Look at how fast things went to shit as soon as Whites left Rhodesia and South Africa.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You you know slavery was a thing right?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It still is a thing, only instead of black people, big companies use illegal immigrants who get paid $2 an hour under the table, work 14 hour days with no real safety precautions and can be fired at any time since they aren&#39;t on the books as actual employees anyway.</p>

<p>The US taking in Blacks as slaves was the best thing that ever happened to them. There&#39;s a reason none of them want to go back to their homelands.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>What specifically makes white races superior? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>You obviously find something attractive about them since you are with one. And it&#39;s evident your ancestors did as well since you are have some White blood in you.</p>

<p>Blacks are strong in athletics. Whites are masters of war and nation building. Asians are quite smart. Jews may be even smarter since they managed to win territory in a war that didn&#39;t even involve them and since they own 4 of the 5 big TV conglomerates, 2 of the 3 big music companies and all 6 of the big movie companies, where they can control the message.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I don’t understand how one can be so full of hate and superficially obsessed with skin color or race.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It&#39;s not about hate. I take a bus sometimes when I do, I&#39;m usually the only White person on it. I realize that less than 30 years ago, that same bus would have been almost all White. I see my community, which use to have its own identity look like every other community. I see the Chinese taking spots in our best schools, which make it harder for Americans to progress. I see the best jobs in the US being occupied by foreigners. I see illegals lowering wages by taking bare bones pay rates while sending all the money back home. I see a group that makes up 13% of the population committing 52% of the crime while our media fawns over them like flies on shit and see every shortcoming of their&#39;s blamed on us.</p>

<p>It makes me fucking sad to see the best country in the world head down its demise and seeing anyone who dares try to contest it be called a racist and a nazi. It makes me sad to know that Whites are going to be the minority in their own damn country in less than 20 years by people who don&#39;t give a single fuck about it while the media celebrates like something out of 1984.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, of course there are famous Jewish scientists and artists, I never said that there weren&#39;t. But look throughout recent history, the Renaissance and classical music, architecture, the vast majority of scientific advances, etc. They are responsible for very little of what has made civilization great. Much of the modern art that is dominated by Jewish people is degenerate and lacking in real quality. And Einstein is way, way overrated, by the way.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You’re obviously a moron, and I’m not going to entertain any of the stupid shit you just said. If Jewish people aren’t responsible for a majority of the contributions to society, guess what, it’s probably related to the fact that they’re a minority. They weren’t renaissance painters? Probably has to do with them getting expelled from every country they sought refuge in.</p>

I don&#39;t think it&#39;s internally consistent to decry race mixing whe  there is extreme diversity amongst &quot;white&quot; ethnicites that you are ok mixing. You generalize white nationalities as part of the same monolithic culture being diluted by miscenation.  That&#39;s just not the case.</p>

<p>In addition, Asian Americans on average are more educated and earn more than White Americans.  They also have stronger associations with the traits you find to be worth promoting in bloodlines, like familialism, nationalism, and discipline.  Are you also opposed to Whites interbreeding with other races to increase their genetic fitness?  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah I have no problem with map changes (though ethnically based forced expulsion sounds pretty fucked up to me) the relevant fact for someone of your persuasion is that partitioning the global population along ethnicity is not a straightforward thing in the first place, as far as ethnicity goes &quot;african&quot; means absolutely nothing. As I mentioned regarding actual ethnic groups (which you didn&#39;t respond to) today there are Nilotic south Sudanese Nilotic folks practicing animism living next to someone in Uganda descendent from the Bantu; their average height and facial features more distinct than the Irish compared to Sicilians.</p>

<p>The comical (white, black, orientals, arabs) categorization (which I presume you&#39;re running on) fails to capture one feature which is found throughout a given race; you could find a pair in any group who differ from each other as much as they may differ from another &quot;race&quot;, each group probably contains 1000s of incompatible cultures. Trying to partition humans into cultural groups is a task only a one world totalitarian regime could complete. </p>

<p>I feel you may be afraid of the end-game world where we all look like tiger woods and like I said it&#39;s fine for people to want to preserve their culture. I just don&#39;t think that little factoid is gonna happen. You and your kindred minds will always be able to form a enclave away from the dreadful mixed folk (at least in our lifetime and barring something apocalyptic which fucks over more than just racial supremacists). </p>

<p>Here&#39;s a though experiment, you cleanse the white lands and now you and all the white folk of the world are together at last, free at last. When you, a South African, a Swede, an Italian, a Pole, a Macedonian and a Serb sit down to decide how white-land works, will perfect harmony prevail or would you have the same old disagreements you had before we miraculously reversed ethnical entropy? </p>

<p>If you don&#39;t take care of an infection in its early stages, it can spread to the whole body. And instead of just putting on a band-aid, you end up with amputations.</p>

<p>We&#39;ve done it thousands of times. How do you think Whites got here? What do you think is happening now with millions of illegal immigrants? That&#39;s not natural. I will gaurantee you that if Whites never touched North America, things wouldn&#39;t be much different here than they were 400 years ago.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Many races and countries made it thousands of years without much change.</p>

<p>Whites and Asians will be fine. White&#39;s have invented just about anything of significance for the last century anyway. I do not think we would suffer much at all if non-Whites disappeared tomorrow. The 13% of the population that commits 52% of the crime would be gone, making things a lot more peaceful and the group of 50 million with 80% of them being on government assistance would give us tons of new cash to do amazing things with.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>The races with the highest average IQ&#39;s in the world are Whites, Asians and the Ashkenazi Jews. The races with the lowest IQ&#39;s are the ones migrating into our countries.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;m actually a huge fan of Star Trek, though I refuse to watch STD and hope that show dies.  I get why people think it&#39;s a left leaning show, but to me it was always right wing:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Races are always treated in a racist way. Klingon&#39;s are always violent and the Vulcan&#39;s are always smart. Sure, one or two here and there might not be like that, but the series always makes it clear that those people are defective rejects. If you learn nothing else from this series, it&#39;s that other races are different and even if they try not to be, it&#39;s hard because of their DNA.</p></li>
<li><p>The Enterprise crew and government usually uphold the law and don&#39;t give into feelings. People who don&#39;t are often punished, even if it&#39;s for the right reasons. The crew often times lets bad shit happen due to not wanting to break rules.</p></li>
<li><p>Violence and fighting are answers to most Star Trek problems, especially in TOS. Kirk and crew fight someone just about every episode.</p></li>
<li><p>TOS LOVES right-wing groups. There&#39;s a nazi ep and there&#39;s a roman ep. It&#39;s pretty clear Roddenberry had some interest in these people.</p></li>
<li><p>The various races are all pretty rich culturally, with the humans really being the only ones who aren&#39;t. They have religions, traditions, customs and totally different ways of life.</p></li>
<li><p>At least in TOS, this show would not support any forced immigration or foreign involvement. They make it clear that when foreigners from other places are introduced to a civilization, it&#39;s bad because it harms their natural evolution and path.</p></li>
</ul>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>And what truth?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Tough wartime conditions during a losing war and bad weather that caused a few thousand to perish were used to create an illegal nation and further a narrative which has caused hundreds of thousands to die and made a mess of the Middle East. Not to mention all the trouble it has brought to Germany and Whites.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>How would it change civilization?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>How do you think Palestine, Iraq, Egypt, Syria and Saudia Arabia would feel if they found out if they knew Israel was built off a lie that has brought endless war and tons of deaths and destruction? I think they&#39;d invade in record time.</p>

<p>The central theme of the Nazi ideology was the final solution, a supreme and superior race. That was their thoughts then and it is now, if you want to agree with SOME of their philosophy there are many thought processes/philosophies/parties that share some similarities. Like those. Not the fucking nazis man. You’re on the losing side here no matter how much you try to spin it. Nazis=bad. Not a Nazi=still potential for bad but at least you’re NOT A FUCKING NAZI!!! It’s not hard dude...</p>

<p>It’s in the book of revelations</p>
</blockquote>

<p>there is no &quot;book of revelations&quot; in the Bible; the mention of the &quot;book of revelations&quot; is one of the surest signs that someone doesn&#39;t know what they&#39;re talking about when they&#39;re discussing apocalyptic literature.</p>

<p>in regard to the book of <em>Revelation</em> (or, as i prefer to call it, the Apocalypse), please quote the portion which states that israel as presently constituted must exist in order for Christ to return.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>and it’s what the evangelicals believe. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>actually, there is a spectrum of belief in evangelicalism regarding zionism, and the most prominent shills for israel in the current american religious scene -- such as john hagee -- are pentecostals.</p>

<p>evangelicalism is also less than 300 years old.</p>

Its the most hypocritical thing ever. The right can manufacture support by creating drama against trump for causes unfavorable to his base so they immediately flip to defend trump. Its pretty genius. I saw the same thing with North Korea lol. Nobel peace Trump a day after they called to nuke Korea lmao.</p>

<p>.... Turn right around this past week and parrot every single MSM talking point regarding Israel. The fucking donald sheep in this sub sound just like the fuckin panelists on CNN this week. 
;</p>

<p>The irony is so fucking delicious it <em>has</em> to be fattening. They&#39;re literally parroting the same exact shit, often word-for-word, that you&#39;d hear on CNN. They&#39;re a fucking joke and I&#39;m glad more people in this sub are waking up to them.</p>

<p>It&#39;s a cult. A cult that is the embodiment of virtually everything this sub has been against: cult of personality, censorship, pro-Israel, pro-Corporate, pro-propaganda, pro-govt line, pro-neocon, pro-torture... It&#39;s absurd how those people so freely infest this place. </p>

Somehow all the pro Israel posters have green points. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I love how this sub is convinced in some grand Jewish propaganda conspiracy, and in doing so, completely neglects to consider the possibility that they&#39;re being used as part of an anti-Jewish one. There&#39;s only one country in the world that gets constantly bombed, rocketed, and shelled without all-out war in retaliation, and there&#39;s only one country in the world whose population&#39;s very existence is a point of deep hatred: it&#39;s Israel. </p>

<p>The idea that anti-Zionism has no government influences is hilariously ignorant of reality. Both Mossad and the rest of the world&#39;s intelligence agencies try to win the propaganda war. The truth is almost always somewhere in the middle, but you&#39;ve got to pick a side. Either the &quot;wipe them from the map&quot; people should win, or Israel should win. There isn&#39;t an alternative in such a starkly contrasted issue. So...I pick Israel. They aren&#39;t throwing gays from rooftops, aren&#39;t stoning women for being raped, and aren&#39;t lopping off heads. Hamas, on the other hand, has routinely used hospitals and schools as human meat shields.  Sure, it&#39;s a war, but...when you purposefully involve your population in your war strategy, don&#39;t get shocked when they get killed along with your troops. </p>

<p>I know anti-semitism is a fairly big thing in conspiracy circles, but y&#39;all could at least pretend to hide it...</p>

What is it with you people bashing others for the way they think. Judaism is different than Zionism so why can’t I support America in supporting Israel while having sympathy for Palestine at the same time and wanting Palestinians to prosper.

<p>It’s safe to assume that all T_D mods are deep state and the sub is heavily monitored. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>As is any sub that is as high traffic as T_D is.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Any comment critical of Israel or Zionism gets straight out deleted within a matter of minutes. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Not true. There&#39;s a way to be critical of things and the mods will make judgement based on your post history. If you&#39;re not a T_D regular and a regular poster in Anti-Trump subs, such as yourself, there is little to no tolerance against abrasive content.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>And you won’t even know it got deleted unless you paste the link in an incognito window. The comment still shows to the person who posted it, but is deleted for anyone else. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is a tool all mods have called shadow banning (I believe).</p>

<blockquote>
<p><a href="/r/the_donald">/r/the_donald</a> is probably the most important piece of influence the zionists have. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>That&#39;s a pretty big assumption. If the people on T_D were high impact or activists in their community, this might be somewhat true. However, the amount of T_D subscribers vs how many people there are in the real world is an incredibly low percentage (600k vs 7.6 billion) makes this statement very &quot;dis-info&quot;ish.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Just yesterday they had a picture of trump with a yarmulke on touching that wall they love so much as the sub pic. If you look at the posts and top comments, all are pro Israel. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>How this makes everyone in the there Jewish heretics, I&#39;m not sure. Usually T_D posters are called Nazis.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>They allow no dissent as the comment is instantly deleted. They know how important the user demographics are as they represent a large portion of Americans who are vocal about their beliefs.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;ve addressed both of these.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It is important for us to reach out to the users of <a href="/r/the_donald">/r/the_donald</a> through direct messages, as mods will simply delete your posts. Inform them of the true nature of these parasites.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Not sure who you&#39;re referring to as parasites, but if you&#39;re calling Jewish people parasites, thats a big red flag as to the voracity/viability of your opinion.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>either you&#39;re an excellent disinfo agent who has mastered the skill of double-speak or you&#39;re confused about the true nature of things. Who exactly do you think the left represent? Who do you think funds these SJW protests? Who do you think (at least not recently) smeared Trump throughout the media before and after the elections?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If you&#39;re looking to move the goal posts to try to get arguement out of me, it&#39;s a waste of time. Your contribution to this sub is the topic I wish to address and why I clicked on it with the intention to post in the first place.</p>

<p>You&#39;re welcome to message me (as your informing others to do) and I&#39;d be happy to talk about my stance on topics not relevant to your OP.</p>

<p>Whites and Asians will be fine. White&#39;s have invented just about anything of significance for the last century anyway. I do not think we would suffer much at all if non-Whites disappeared tomorrow. The 13% of the population that commits 52% of the crime would be gone, making things a lot more peaceful and the group of 50 million with 80% of them being on government assistance would give us tons of new cash to do amazing things with.</p>

<p>The races with the highest average IQ&#39;s in the world are Whites, Asians and the Ashkenazi Jews. The races with the lowest IQ&#39;s are the ones migrating into our countries.</p>

<p>I take it you’re not a big fan of Star Trek, which envisions all cultures somewhat uniting under western customs and practices. </p>

<p>I&#39;m actually a huge fan of Star Trek, though I refuse to watch STD and hope that show dies.  I get why people think it&#39;s a left leaning show, but to me it was always right wing:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Races are always treated in a racist way. Klingon&#39;s are always violent and the Vulcan&#39;s are always smart. Sure, one or two here and there might not be like that, but the series always makes it clear that those people are defective rejects. If you learn nothing else from this series, it&#39;s that other races are different and even if they try not to be, it&#39;s hard because of their DNA.</p></li>
<li><p>The Enterprise crew and government usually uphold the law and don&#39;t give into feelings. People who don&#39;t are often punished, even if it&#39;s for the right reasons. The crew often times lets bad shit happen due to not wanting to break rules.</p></li>
<li><p>Violence and fighting are answers to most Star Trek problems, especially in TOS. Kirk and crew fight someone just about every episode.</p></li>
<li><p>TOS LOVES right-wing groups. There&#39;s a nazi ep and there&#39;s a roman ep. It&#39;s pretty clear Roddenberry had some interest in these people.</p></li>
<li><p>The various races are all pretty rich culturally, with the humans really being the only ones who aren&#39;t. They have religions, traditions, customs and totally different ways of life.</p></li>
<li><p>At least in TOS, this show would not support any forced immigration or foreign involvement. They make it clear that when foreigners from other places are introduced to a civilization, it&#39;s bad because it harms their natural evolution and path.</p></li>
</ul>

    <div class="md"><p>No, I just can&#39;t believe that anyone would be so racist.</p>

<p>Italian isn&#39;t a skin color, African isn&#39;t a skin color, Muslim isn&#39;t a skin color. Where someone lives and what religion they practice has nothing to do with skin color.</p>

<p>Your ideal America is incredibly racially driven. It is not a vision for a country built upon laws, equality, or human rights.</p>

<p>I question if you actually understand what the first amendment means. You seem like someone who would yell about your right to free speech being infrindged upon by someone telling you to shut up. That is not a violation of the first amendment.</p>

<p>If owning a gun represents what you think it means to be American, you&#39;ve set the bar pretty low.</p>

<p>The electoral process means (well, it should mean) that all citizens are represented, no matter their skin color or religious preference.</p>

<p>...what? When has American ever been whites only?</p>

<p>Look, maybe you should try to be more inclusive and stop thinking your skin color makes you special in any way.</p>

<p>The central theme of the Nazi ideology was the final solution, a supreme and superior race. That was their thoughts then and it is now, if you want to agree with SOME of their philosophy there are many thought processes/philosophies/parties that share some similarities. Like those.

<p>Your entire post falls apart due to this statement right here. Even if we all “look” the same....Italians would still be Italian because they’re from Italy. Africans would still be Africans because they’re from Africa. Muslims would still be Muslim because they worship allah. Americans would still be Americans because they either hold citizenship or are born in America (hence holding citizenship). Man you’re from T_D aren’t you because there’s no way someone holds these views unless they worship the God emporer of the US....you sound like one hell of a racist asshole</p>
