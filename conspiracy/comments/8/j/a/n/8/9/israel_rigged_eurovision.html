<p>My thoughts is that Israel rigged the Eurovision finale so that they won. This forces europe to acknowledge Jerusalem as the capitol of Israel next year, or boycott Eurovision and out themselves as anti-semites.</p>

<p>This year Eurovision was slightly different, the juries had more influence on the outcome.
These juries are media personalities and singers.</p>

<p>In her victory speech, Netta said &quot;Next year in Jerusalem&quot;, which has been some kind of chant for jews throughout the times as a sign of the desire to return to Jerusalem.
Except that next year it will actually be in Jerusalem.
She also praised diversity.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Israel&#39;s cyber control is becoming apparent IMO. After they were caught hacking jcpoa, the white house and Congress, they must be doing good. They were also working with Cambridge Analytica to get trump in. So, having been caught hacking democrats, then caught working with team trump, its likely Israel is behind all the hacks and leaks in the election to get a republican puppet. Since that was so big, I wouldn&#39;t doubt they&#39;d use that capability for little victories for propaganda.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;The popular vote is not a good representation of an entire nation&quot;</p>

<p>I&#39;m sorry, what? That is the dumbest thing I have ever heard. </p>

<p>If you run a 2 party system, and  54&amp;#37; of the entire population votes for one of them. It makes sense to represent that 54&amp;#37; of the population, not the other 46&amp;#37; because of how some districts were drawn. Proportional representation is the fairest way to represent a nation, because everyone has equal impact on the vote, you know, the full sum of what makes a nation. First past the post, the dumb system of the UK, the US, and plenty of other places, makes it so that people in power can redraw districts (Gerrymandering) so that even if a county has e.g. 60&amp;#37; support for one party, they can distribute the districts in such a way that the lesser percentage wins.</p>

<p>Let&#39;s say we have 50 people that we need to split into 5 equally sized districts of 10. If we know the expected outcome of the vote, e.g. where people are likely to vote what, then we can redraw the districts such that an obvious 60&amp;#37; democrat to 40&amp;#37; republican vote becomes the opposite. If we draw two districts that contain 9 democrats, and 1 republican, then draw three districts that contain 6 republicans and 4 democrats. Suddenly, even though there are 30 democrats in total over the 20 republicans, because three districts come out with a 60&amp;#37; republican vote, and the other two at 90&amp;#37; democrat, because you use first past the post, this gives three seats to republicans and only two seats to democrats because of an intentional distribution to sway the favour of one party over another.</p>

<p>That&#39;s not representation, that&#39;s political swindle.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>First, control-c control-v will help when you want to quote people. </p>

<p>Second, I am well aware as to what gerrymandering is. I live in one of the most gerrymandered states in the nation and I am against gerrymandering.</p>

<p>Third, I am talking about by the nation as 50 individual states and the land that lies within it. Popular vote cannot give equal representation to most states, to most land holders, to most of the country. It will give you as an individual an equal right and that is it. <a href="https://www.maps4office.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/usa-states-population-2010-anamorphic.png">This is where the power would lie by state if we used popular vote.</a></p>

<p>You cannot use popular vote. It is impossible. Someone who lives in LA or NYC or Miami or Chicago, has no clue what is happening in Hays, Kansas or Many Farms, Arizona. And these towns are the vast majority of America. The urban centers would be the people making all of the high level governmental decisions for those cities.</p>

<p>You seem to be a Dem who is still upset with the election. Let me leave you with this.</p>

<p>Without CA Trump wins the popular vote by over 1.5 million votes.</p>

<p>Trump won 86.6% of counties.</p>

<p>Clinton won 88 of the 100 most populated counties which drove the popular vote.</p>

<p>Those 88 counties, while large in population, only represent a small portion of the entire US interest.</p>

<p>The electoral college did exactly what it was supposed to do in 2016, it balanced power.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot; Also the US is a Republic not a Democracy so the first 10 seconds of that video shows the ignorance. &quot;</p>

<p>You do know that the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy#Republic">USA is a representative/constitutional republic</a>, which is defined as a form of democracy, right? You can&#39;t pretend like you know anything about any election system if you claim that the USA is not a democracy, and that it is instead &quot;a republic&quot;, <strong>even though a republic is one of many types of democracy.</strong>  </p>

<p>The election system of the USA and the UK are the same, spare the we elect a prime minister instead of a president, as they are both <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First-past-the-post_voting#List_of_current_FPTP_countries">first past the post countries</a> and I was complaining about both of them. I wasn&#39;t saying the UK had it any better, they have the exact same problem, where parties can win more constituencies with a much lower percentage of the actual popular vote than their competitors.</p>

<p>The UK is service country, meaning most of our gain per capita comes in the form of our GNP, not GDP. Our GNP, like the US, is not on a downward slope. The GDP is decreasing, because of the obvious problem pertaining to Brexit, which I also disagree with.</p>

<p>This discussion was about how FPTF means that gerrymandering is effective in sabotaging elections when people with vested interest are permitted to redraw the lines. Everything you mentioned in your previous comment is immeasurably irrelevant, and half of it factually incorrect. I suggest that you stop pretending like you could teach anyone anything about civics  and actually study it yourself before trying to make any claims about election systems.</p>

<p>Why would this force any country to accept Jerusalem as the capitol? You can participate in the event and say it&#39;s just a major city.</p>

<p>Apart the fact that somehow fat=diverse nowadays how is this remotely connected to your conspiracy?</p>

<p>And lastly she came third by the juror votes by quite a margin and won because of the popularity vote which seems accurate considering her youtube video views/upvote ratio prior to the contest.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It used to get blatantly rigged, no doubt about it. That&#39;s why they overhauled the entire voting system to make it practically impossible to rig.

<p>Don&#39;t disagree, but it changes slightly if you know who the jury consists of. It&#39;s usually former participants, the national organizers, and the commentators.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Why not make it completely transparent and up to the public?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It is transparant, just not fully democratic.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Why have a jury that could have been cherry-picked...</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Not only &quot;could&quot;, <strong>has</strong> been cherry picked. The answer is quite simple. It&#39;s the Eurovision Songfestival, not the European Union Songfestival. They want to uphold traditions, and make sure that a certain type of songs enter the competition. Now to you this might sound like influencing, but this literally happens in every competition ever. Except Eurovision, just like for instance X-Factor or American next Topmodel, don&#39;t just limit themselves to gateway selection, they select throughout. However, the proces itself is transparant.</p>

<p>Well, is the process on jury selction transparent? who gets to be a jury and who decides who is selected?</p>

<p>The thing is, X factor and other competitions are usually national in scope. With international competitions there comes a need for it being more than just entertainment. What if the Olympics was &#39;judged&#39; instead of being measured by timing devices? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well.. yes it&#39;s a conspiracy theory so we should take such discussions with a huge pinch of salt. I&#39;m a big fan of the Eurovision but this year I&#39;ve seen some weird stuff that I didn&#39;t like going around...</p>

<p>I believe there are chances it was rigged in a &quot;lawful&quot; way if you get what I mean..I don&#39;t think Cyprus is like a hard opponent, I think it never won anyways and it was the bookies&#39; favorite with extremely low rates like 11/10 as I remember. Last year Sobral had only 5/4 for example and he won. I believe the odds are hardly wrong each year especially concerning the winner. What was also very very troubling were the many dislikes in the opponent&#39;s youtube videos that all of a sudden dropped exponentially once the final was over. Did you see it? Their biggest opponent was Cyprus with 1 extra million views than Israel. And the views historically on the youtube channel were directly linked with the winner as well (except in cases like this year&#39;s Russia entry which was well.. unfit for Eurovision). The most disturbing thing is a poll somewhere on the internet with somewhat 100.000 voters that was showing again cyprus to win by seeing the change in votes in the last three days before the final...and it was a fucking significant change.</p>

<p>I genuinely did not think about Jerusalem being a possible reason but well... it sort of makes sense. The past few days two were the major news about Israel: a) winning the Eurovision contest and b) showcasing the new US embassy in Jerusalem which caused serious clashes and deaths in the border with the Gaza Strip. Could it really be?? Are the above points considered evidence?</p>
