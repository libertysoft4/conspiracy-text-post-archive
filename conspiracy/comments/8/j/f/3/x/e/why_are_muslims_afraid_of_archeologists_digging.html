And if ANY remains of the Temple was discovered shit would go Nuclear even more than America finally declaring we move the Embassy to Israel’s true historic capital. So why are Muslims so afraid of History? Especially when they control every corner of the Middle East EXCEPT the area controlled by the Jews. </p>

<p>The Canaanites, more specifically the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amorites">Amorites</a> were the ones who travelled East thousands of years before the Exodus and established <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Babylon">Babylon</a> after causing the downfall of the Third Dynasty of Ur.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>We know that Muhammad was jealous/impressed by the monotheistic religions of Jerusalem when his matriarchal wife sent him on a trade mission there.  After he returned from the region he started trying to copy the success of the Jews and their holy book.  As a matter of fact the Quran assumes the reader is familiar with the Jewish and Christian literature and doesn&#39;t bother to even copy the borrowed parts such as the forbidden nature of homosexuality.  No where in the Quran does it mention homosexuality being wrong.</p>

<p>The tendency for Islam to try to overwrite other religions Genesis of ideas and even their holy sites is why so many other religions have issues existing next door to Islam.</p>

<p>Even the kaaba is just a recycled pagan holy site that existed before Muhammad was even born.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Counterpoint: It is very thoroughly maintained throughout Islam’s teachings that it is a follow-up to the teachings of prior prophets, and is an improvement upon existing doctrine. Also, yes, the Quran does not frequently take an overt position on homosexuality, but it does have the story of Lut, and there’s a pretty logical follow-through from its explicit outline of who can marry whom.</p>

<p>“O Prophet! Why do you prohibit what God has made lawful for you, in terms of your Coptic handmaiden Māriya — when he lay with her in the house of Hafsa, who had been away, but who upon returning [and finding out] became upset by the fact that this had taken place in her own house and on her own bed — by saying, ‘She is unlawful for me!’, seeking, by making her unlawful [for you], to please your wives? And God is Forgiving, Merciful, having forgiven you this prohibition.” Tafsir Al-jalalain on verse 66:1</p>

<p>No I&#39;m not spreading propaganda.</p>

<p>I&#39;m sorry your prophet was a crazy person.  You know Muhammad himself was convinced he was talking to demons and not God until later. He was most likely correct with his initial instinct.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>When you say misinterpretation you&#39;re acknowledging that the verse is real, just not being interpreted correctly.  But here is the thing, the whole book if packed full of shit like this.  </p>

<p>Is Muhammad&#39;s 6 year old wife a misinterpretation?</p>

<p>Is killing apostates a misinterpretation?  </p>

<p>And does it even matter when Muslims themselves apparently are interpreting incorrectly as well.  Since they do all those things in real life.</p>

<p>Misinterpretation or not it&#39;s affecting everyone&#39;s reality.  But in reality we all know it&#39;s not an interpenetration, it&#39;s just an embarrassing quote from the Muhammad warlord, founder of the religion of peace.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>at this point I can&#39;t see any good coming from excavations, other than the seeds of deeper troubles</p>

<p>the reasons for not digging has likely got more in common with Pandora&#39;s Box than the Bible/Quran</p>

<p>I&#39;d luv it if they did.. deeply curious what could be found, but it&#39;s not worth peoples lives... and a joint venture jsut doesn&#39;t seem likely</p>
