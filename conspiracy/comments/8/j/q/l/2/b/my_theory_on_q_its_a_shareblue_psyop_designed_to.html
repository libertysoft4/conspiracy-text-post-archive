<p>Trump has been talking about n korea for decades</p>

<p>Q doesnt have to be a agent to figure out that trumps trying ti negotiate peace</p>

<p>Meanwhile at that time peace had not been negotiated</p>

<p>also that woukd have been one correct prediction out of thousands</p>

<p>And u know damn well that if n korea hadnt come to the table u would have forgotten about it and made some excuse like &quot;this takes time&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hmm. That IS interesting</p>

<p>Literally noone even had any IDEA that trump was even TRYING to do anything with north korea or iran until cnn reported it a few weeks ago.</p>

<p>So how could q have known?</p>

<p>This is absolute proof.</p>

<p>And to prove im actually q</p>

<p>Ill make this prediction</p>

<p>Within a short time trump will have a one on one meeting with kim jong un himself. I know because i work with trump.</p>

<p>Also (and this is because im q) i know for a FACT that soon. Very soon. Trump will cut funding to planned Parenthood.</p>

<p>Noone else could know that. Only a high level trump person could know that.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>We were discussing it before november. U can check.</p>

<p>Its ridiculous</p>

<p>But some people have this innate need to feel like Donald Trump is 100% in control. Combined with the need to feel like they&#39;re special. So they believe this idea to the top level agent in the government is communicating to them specifically on a white supremacist message board because they&#39;re special. And this top agent just confirming that every single thing that happens in the entire world is all part of Trumps plan plan</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Actually, it&#39;s the equivalent of Top Secret (TS) for the Dept of Energy. Officially speaking, there is no &quot;higher&quot; level than TS, however there are an unknowable number of acknowledged and unacknowledged keyword referenced programs, which could simply be thought of as bodies of information carved up in very specific ways. Some keyword programs <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yankee_White">aren&#39;t so secret</a>, while others will never be known. In many cases, you&#39;re going to find all of your classified details right in the public. It&#39;s the map that ties them all together that&#39;s classified. </p>

<p>The mention of &quot;Q&quot; clearance really bothered me initially since my tickets come from a DoD background and its much less common. The questions that Q has managed to string together in the course of over 1000 posts that lead to public information...almost like a map, show that he has access to a level of data that is uncommon for most people. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>VATICAN CITY (AP) — Pope Francis said Tuesday he has thought about when it might be time to &quot;take leave&quot; of his flock — a cryptic comment that could hint at another papal retirement down the line or a suggestion to other bishops that it&#39;s time to go.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.nydailynews.com/newswires/news/world/pope-thought-time-leave-article-1.3990543">http://www.nydailynews.com/newswires/news/world/pope-thought-time-leave-article-1.3990543</a></p>

<p>He has never hinted at retirement and in <strong><em>May</em></strong> he say&#39;s this. There are a lot of co incidences happening here.</p>

<p>What specific Q posts are you talking about?</p>

<p>He said hes thought about eventually down the line</p>

<p>The pope says things every week. The q troll knows youll find ANYTHING the pope says that could be negative and claim thats what he was talking about</p>

<p>Here: i can do ut too</p>

<p>Obama will have a bad end of may</p>

<p>Nyc will get a surprise</p>

<p>Money coming</p>

<p>I literally just made up random statements. All of them can be true</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes. Because the top level govt guy chose YOU and only YOU to share his secret info.</p>

<p>Hes trying to &quot;get people prepared&quot; and &quot;spread the word&quot; by posting vague cryptic messages on a white supremacist message board that nobody uses.</p>

<p>I know if i needed to get a message out thats how id do it</p>

<p>He uses 4chan cuz its Anonymous. Because if the fbi tried to figure out who he was theyd be stumped because they go off usernames.</p>

<p>They dont have any high twch ways of tracing people. Its all uaernames and 4chan doesnt have those.</p>

<p>Honestly i would sufgeat u do research. But you wont.</p>

<p>You want to believe this. Thats why cults work. They attract people who WANT to believe.</p>

<p>You dont want to believe that trump isnt 100% in control at all times</p>

<p>You dont want to believe that jeff sessions might ve bad</p>

<p>You dont want to believe that hillary will walk free</p>

<p>And this will pacify you for at least 4 years</p>

<p>Nothing about q makes sense.</p>

<p>And all his &quot;predictions&quot; require alot of imagination.</p>

<p>Im not an expert on helping people in cults. And i know only an expert could convince u.</p>

<p>So have fun believing that &quot;any day now&quot; itll all go down for the next 8 years.</p>

<p>But just dont get in the way of reasonable people trying to actually get things done </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Because that one is the most direct, blatant, over the top prediction, which is not the same style as all the others.

Q is full of shit!!” in order to discredit any legitimate posts in the future. </p>

<p>And have you even bothered to follow the Awan case, or the NYPD and the FBIs case with Weiner’s laptop, or <em>anything</em> besides the Muller investigation? Things are happening, people are resigning, being fired, pieces are moving. </p>

<p>For a conspiracy theorist, you seem to be pretty dead set on closing the door to any possibilities other than what you’ve already decided is the case. Why bother caring about it at all if you don’t think it’s real?</p>

<p>Eric Prince&#39;s interview on Breibart was possibly the most interesting thing I ever heard. Why would a mercenary provider of the spooks call out HRC&#39;s gang? hmmm...smells like a counter coup false flag and control demolition of something or possibly the entire collapse of the United States.</p>

<p>Q is a pysop, not just a LARP. Which makes me wonder, What exactly is the intended outcome of making the US government class eat itself? who is making this decision to &#39;pull&#39; it? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ehhhh I’m not so sure anymore. Ever since I started reading some of the posts on r/greatawakening, it really looks like there are definitely insiders posting anonymously out there. Yes there are posers and larpers, but I’ve seen enough posts get pretty specific about events that have been happening to believe that it’s not just a shareblue psyop.</p>

<p>If anything, the more attention people like Q get, larp or not, the more likely other insiders will think about jumping in.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Lol I’m sorry, but this is one of the most speculative and inaccurate gish gallops I’ve ever seen. The author of that post is speaking about this topic with the same certainty that they mock he opposing side for having towards Q. The first half is straight speculation, and the second half is about the bullshit claims that we already discussed in this post.</p>

<p>If that’s your best “debunking”, and that is what you’re basing your conclusions on, then you are going off of just as much faith as those who follow Q’s post. You WANT it to be fake/psyop/larp just as much as they WANT it to be legit. Neither of you have any real proof for anything, so the fact that anyone is speaking in absolutes is just ridiculous.</p>

<p>You&#39;ll know Q&#39;s real intentions, the fake posts and fake predictions from the real ones that are created to throw off the libtards. </p>

<p>Hurry quick. I probably won&#39;t have many decoders left after I click save. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;d be strange if shareblue was behind this PR campaign, but I agree that Q is actually a public relations campaign. The goal is to keep conspiracy a minded people engaged and supportive of Trump. The goal is to trick &quot;conspiracy theorists&quot; into blindly supporting the crimes of the government when we&#39;d otherwise be united against their bullshit. </p>
