    <div class="md"><p>Are Corporatism and Consumerism not easy, slippery-slope, almost inevitable consequences of Capitalism, however?  I wonder if what you&#39;re saying isn&#39;t similar to saying &quot;Killing someone while driving under the influence isn&#39;t the fault of the use of substances themselves.  It&#39;s a fault of their <em>misuse.&quot;</em></p>

<p>&quot;Use&quot; very easily, if not inevitably, becomes &quot;misuse&quot; in many cases, however.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not sure Capitalism doesn&#39;t almost inevitably <em>become</em> corporatism and consumerism under the auspices of the current civilization - making the differentiation between the three quite possibly fallacious.</p>

<p>To be sure, almost every other political system has its own degenerations, and these very degenerations have for the most part come to pass more often than not.  Communism, Socialism, and almost every other type of &quot;ism&quot; has been polluted and mutated into a nightmare version of what it could possibly be in its more evolved form.</p>

<p>However, it seems important - if one is to be an intellectually honest critical thinker - to acknowledge that A) corporatism and consumerism are quite caustic and deleterious in themselves, and B) it appears <em>very</em> difficult for Capitalism to <em>not</em> eventually become these very things.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I disagree. Capitalism isn’t a political system. Bartering is a capitalistic system. It is the position of power governments(a state) provide that allows capitalism to be twisted into corporatism.

<p>Perhaps I just don’t understand capitalism then because bartering does <em>not</em> seem like anything capitalistic to me.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>It would seem that it is the <em>misuse</em> of a state’s position of power that leads to corporatism - not so much the position of power in itself.  One can use a position of power in quite a productive way if one is so disposed.</p>

<p>It’s just that the governments in this civilization haven’t appeared to be anywhere near so disposed.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Oh I am absolutely certain there are.  Definitely.</p>

<p>I’m just not familiar with any of them being used in an actual, real world manner on this planet.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>What does that mean - a “circular economy”?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Capitalism isn’t inherently bad</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I don’t imagine that really any system is, to be honest.  It’s not the system in itself.  It’s the misuse of the system.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>it’s just a spontaneous and organic ordering of society that can easily be abused if a corruptible government(state) exists</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And corrupt and corruptible governments ABSOLUTELY exist.</p>

<p>I’m not super familiar with any government that <em>hasn’t</em> been corrupt in this civilization’s history, as a matter of fact.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, think about the term “free trade”. Bartering is free trade in it’s purist form.
And no, all governments rely on the representative governance modal which puts representatives in a position of power. It’s not that power corrupts, but that it is a magnet to the corruptible.</p>

<p>As far as I know, there arnt really any other capitalist systems in practice today, but that’s changing thanks to block chain and other distributed ledger technologies a new token economy is beginning to emerge. </p>

<p>A circular economy is a token economy in which the re-use and re-purchase of items is incintivised through the reward of crypto currency. </p>

<p>I actually wrote an entire paper on this subject

    <div class="md"><p>The value of an item is driven by market forces, even in a bartering system. One of those market forces is the need of an item. That is basic supply and demand. And it’s not a debt owed to soldiers, it’s payment to soldiers for work they’ve done, that’s exactly the same as bartering but with the extra step of involving a currency. Admittedly there is a huge problem with the centralized distribution of currency(aka the federal reserve and other banks) but the concept of money itself is just a tool, a tool that makes bartering easier. Before capitalism, the only way for man to acquire wealth was through conquest.</p>

<p>Capitalism is a system that provides a tool: money that helps to easily facilitate trade. It’s a tool that gives an individual the ability to easily trade for the labor of others to do things he can’t or doesn’t have time to do, or that he can’t accomplish on his own. Money(capitalism) is literally the only system that empowers the individual by allowing him to vote on the services of others. Don’t like the way port of subs makes sandwiches, vote for the better sandwich and get what you need by spending your money at subway. 
A free market is formed from spontaneous order, based on the consent of individuals. History has shown that top down, centrally planned communist systems where the collective is more important than the rights of the individual become tyrannical. It’s too much of a concentration of power. </p>

<p>No, it didn&#39;t. Capitalism produced massive wealth inequality and poverty throughout it&#39;s bloody history. Capitalism is system driven my profit, so any technology that is not potentially profitable is not pursued.

<p>Future ideas. Someone design a better system. We can&#39;t do that until we admit the one we have is broken.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>One bad thing that comes from capitalism will not bring it down. We can sit here all day and bitch and moan about corruption and rent seeking and inequality,  but at the end of the day capitalism is still the best form of government ever created. As bad as capitalism is in some ways, everything else is much worse. That is why socialists and communists always claim thay Venezuela and North korea and the Soviet Union are not real socialism and communism.   They can only ever offer an alternative that doesn&#39;t exist because they can then pretend that their alternative will not have corruption and poverty and murder. It always does.</p>

<p>Maybe we just haven&#39;t come up with a better system yet? Maybe we could if we could all recognize Capitalism doesn&#39;t work for the majority of people, and focus our attention on trying to create a better system. We defeat ourselves before we even try with that ancient-ass logic &quot;Oh, this is the best thing of all the things that have been tried in the past, so no need to question it!&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, think about the term “free trade”. Bartering is free trade in it’s purist form.
And no, all governments rely on the representative governance modal which puts representatives in a position of power. It’s not that power corrupts, but that it is a magnet to the corruptible.</p>

<p>As far as I know, there arnt really any other capitalist systems in practice today, but that’s changing thanks to block chain and other distributed ledger technologies a new token economy is beginning to emerge. </p>

<p>A circular economy is a token economy in which the re-use and re-purchase of items is incintivised through the reward of crypto currency. </p>

<p>I actually wrote an entire paper on this subject

    <div class="md"><p>You are clearly confused about what capitalism is and what it isn’t. I suggest you start with the actual definition of capitalism and move on from there. Also, communism has been responsible for far more deaths than just about any other system, only a moron would think it to be a viable solution after all the death it’s caused. </p>
