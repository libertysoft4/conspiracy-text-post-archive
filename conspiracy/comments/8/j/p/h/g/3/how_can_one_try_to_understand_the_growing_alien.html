It honestly makes no sense saying this because the best way to understand was to be conciously living in it, and being able to know the ideas being thrown around and the rise of communities dedicated to this topic. Even so, I still want to learn more about it if anything and if anyone still has any links to old alien communities of the 90s, defunct or not via wayback or documentaries that were an integral part of this era beside the 1995 faked roswell footage then I&#39;d really appreciate it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s why I think of it as a sort of reemergence. There were a lot of movies in the 50&#39;s about Aliens too, then it kinda died down in the 60&#39;s/70&#39;s, started ticking up again in the late 80&#39;s and finally culminated in the 90&#39;s, then died down again in the wake of 9/11 and &#39;08, and seems to be on the rise again. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s probably the biggest piece of disinfo to discredit alternative researchers.</p>

<p>It&#39;s a long con, they have been managing this con for half a century. It&#39;s only purpose is to poison the well.</p>

<p>I have looked into UFOs in the past and I found no evidence at all.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes no evidence at all. A bunch of supposed official documents which look bogus.</p>

<p>A bunch of video testimonies which look totally fake. </p>

<p>And a bunch of video footage which was just showing future military planes. Like some people claiming triangular shaped UFO&#39;s in the 60&#39;s turns out it was a B-2 Spirit that was revealed a few years later (87).</p>

<p>So roughly it&#39;s just hidden military tech 20-30 years ahead.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;ll have to toss away tens of thousands accounts that cross continents, cultures and centuries.  Sorry, friend, but you should take a second look. And even if what you are saying is true, and it&#39;s all nothing more than advanced secret military technology, well then that story alone is the story of the century, if you understand what these craft are capable of. Hiding technology from humanity that could save the planet and change the world? Don&#39;t downplay it either way. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Op, there are a lot of 1990s MUFON and other lectures on youtube to get an idea of the culture.  1990s was all about New Age, Armagedonism of the Millennium, and alien abductions. Most of the time the aliens having some new agey message about the millennium. </p>

<p>Bookstores and bestsellers were all about abductions and  spirit channeling, always with a utopian or distopian future warned by the aliens. 
Bud Hopkins, Stieber, John Mack, Greer were best sellers at the time. 
Popular prime time TV (XFiles) was full.of sci-fi, but did not pre-date the book market.  The 1980s armagedonism, new age and Satanic Panic  paved the way for popcultural acceptance of Abductions.  ArtBell was also very popular in the 1990s.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;d read and/or watch &quot;Communion&quot;. In my opinion Communion was a catalyst in popularizing it. It has all the original &quot;tropes&quot; of alien abduction. If you can find a usenet archive that would also help since that was where people were talking (I searched &quot;Communion&quot; and got a [post|<a href="https://groups.google.com/d/topic/alt.ufo/EJ9dZ6YTrGo/discussion">https://groups.google.com/d/topic/alt.ufo/EJ9dZ6YTrGo/discussion</a>] with a neat quote from Carl Jung in it (from 1951). The person posting it talks briefly about COmmunion being a &quot;catalyst&quot; which I tend to agree to. Here&#39;s Carl Jung quote:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;I&#39;m puzzled to death about these phenomena,  because I haven&#39;t been
able yet to make out with sufficient certainty whether the whole thing
is a rumour with concomitant singular and mass hallucination, or a
downright fact. Either case would be highly interesting. If it&#39;s a
rumour, then the apparition of discs must be a symbol produced by the
unconscious. We know what such a thing would mean seen from the
psychological standpoint. If on the other hand it is a hard and concrete
fact, we are surely confronted with something thoroughly out of the way.
At a time when the world is divided by an iron curtain-a fact unheard-of
in human history-we might expect all sorts of funny things, since when
such a thing happens in an individual it means a complete dissociation,
which is instantly compensated by symbols of wholeness and unity. The
phenomenon of the saucers might even be both, rumour as well as fact.
In this case it would be what I call a synchronicity. It&#39;s just too bad that 
we don&#39;t know enough about it.&quot;  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>My perspective is that it was a reflection of fears of technology (dawn of the information age), a need for a more scientific &quot;supernatural&quot;, and maybe some other things. Another thing that is interesting is the subsequent alien mania in Brazil which followed closely on the heels of the popularity in America.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s really odd that there were certain very common fringe phenomenon which seemed to exist in their own time periods:</p>

<p>Alien Abductions / Men in Black / Cattle Mutilations</p>

<p>Suicide and Doomsday Cults</p>

<p>Serial Killers</p>

<p>School Shooters</p>

<p>I&#39;m not saying there weren&#39;t some overlap, or that they all disappeared, but each of then phenomenon seemed to be very large, fade away, and get replace by another.</p>

<p>It really makes you wonder what was going on behind the scenes (I&#39;ll leave this as a stand-in for cultural manipulation, spiritual consciousness, whatever you want to decide caused it.)</p>

<p>I might have to check my dates, but there is/was a certain period of time where if you were on a European farm, it disqualified you from giving blood. This is supposedly related to hoof-and-mouth disease (though maybe secretly also mad cow disease.) The US didn&#39;t have this, but we did have a big wave of cattle mutilations. Perhaps protective methods? or were we stupid enough to try to weaponize prions?</p>
