    <div class="md"><p>Not sure if you&#39;re asking about about the discrepancy of the Third eye or just glands (The Endocrine System) and chakra&#39;s in general?</p>

<p>It goes some thing like this:</p>

<p>Root Chakra is the Adrenal</p>

<p>Sacral is the Reproductive system (Testes and Ovaries)</p>

<p>Solar Plexus is the Pancreas</p>

<p>Heart chakra is the Thymus</p>

<p>Throat is the Thyroid</p>

<p>Third Eye/Brow is the Pituitary </p>

<p>and Crown is the Pineal</p>

<p>It&#39;s been referenced and studied by many so you can take your pick on the internet.  Just look up Endocrine system and Chakra&#39;s.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The pineal gland is a very interesting installation.</p>

<p>I remember reading a book about it maybe 15 years ago, that discussed its poorly understood purpose and under-investigated importance. - Funny the memory of that  book has stuck with me all these years.</p>

<p>As I recall it said the human pineal gland was responsible for identifying pheromones which are a deep seated motivator for human behavior and interaction. (as in sexual attraction) Pheromones are a well recognized motivator for animal behavior but not much studied in people.</p>

<p>It went on to describe people who had suffered nose/nasal damage which disabled their ability to perceive pheromones, and caused a loss of perception to &#39;see&#39; or &#39;read&#39; other people, similar to the loss of the sense of smell affecting the ability to taste.</p>

<p>It mentioned that people who had undergone cosmetic or reconstructive rhinoplasty often noticed a change in sex drive or the  reduced attraction to sexual activity; the book surmised that the nasal damage had permanently affected the function of the pineal gland.</p>

<p>When I was young I remember being very concerned about the imperfection of my nose and giving serious consideration to having it remodeled. Eventually I came to accept my nose as being ok and not worth the effort, and didn&#39;t do anything about it. After reading that book I was very happy that I had left it alone.</p>

<p>Interesting subject. Thanks for reminding me. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Wow. If this is true, the connection between the pineal and pheromones and the nose, then what Dick Gregory said could make sense to me  now. He went on a rampage exposing the TPTB shortly before he suddenly died recently. One interesting comment he made that never made sense to me was that the pyramids are shaped as such because of how a nose is shaped. Didnt really explain why they wouldve done so, but I wonder if this is why. Look him and his videos up, real eye openers. </p>

<p>the all seeing eye inside of a pyramid.  many believe the pineal gland is our third eye, could the reason the eye inside of a pyramid exists because the pyramid represents the nose?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, was thinking that too earlier. Trace your finger up your nose and it leads directly where the third eye is usually pointed at as being located. On the US one dollar bill it shows the all seeing eye floating directly above the tip of the pyramid</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Your statement is correct. Most have considered that belief system to have been religion, but in actual fact our better than religion is simply scientific theory. 
There is a vastness to this which is almost incomprehensible. </p>

<p>We now notice this world is different than when Stephen Hawking arrived. And his idea is always to explore the furthest reaches of the mind. Whom have you conferred these new realities too, now that Stephen Hawking is not on our planet anymore. </p>

<p>I have used many like Michio Kaku for one but the reality is even his abilities are quite small scant area of thickness of theories. </p>

<p>To look inside ones own mind is one of the new driving forces for humanity to consider. </p>

<p>Buddha with all his realities were welcome and they tried again and again to replicate that. </p>

<p>Some of us do have these concepts  but we are better for the looking and the dreaming and the imaging and someone is the next on the lineup. </p>

<p>Your demands as you slam your own hand to the table without actually causing bodily damage  is to wonder &quot;give me proofs&quot;. Scientists only issue theories not proofs. Become aware of the plan. </p>

<p>One shirt walked backwards this very minute in front of my own window. Another theory which this one is so adamantly sent against. Yet he knows Triumph motorcycle and Triumf Cyclotron Project in Vancouver as a work place for tasks to be done. </p>

<p>The timing is impeccable. Yes was the answer. Yes is the start of the plan. </p>

<p>I do not do this to this human very often but he is required to join into the future. Seven faces and more exist. </p>

<p>When you active the third eye properly here is what happens. Threads of gold spin themselves around and about. All religions use these in all of their own paintings. </p>

<p>I walk through them. There are so many openings. I can even become confused. Yet I find this is time to move on to another question which some open mind is considering right about NOW.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have personally experienced and will testify that switching away from flouridated water affects your abilty to dream, imagine and in general think, in a positive way.  </p>

<p>I believe I got a 5% iq increase when I started drinking reverse osmosis and/or well water.  </p>

<p>Also, when I had my mercury fillings removed, similar benefits but not really realized until I did both.  </p>

<p>There is a gland in your head, whatever you call it, that is where you are when you have dreams at night.  </p>

<p>Other ways to achieve similar things in a semi-waking meditative state are called concentration practice.  </p>

<p>Whether what you see in dreams is all inside your head or is not is, in my opinion, one of the most serious questions in the entire world and behind this question religoins, secret societies, militaries, criminals, the insane and all kinds of people wrestle over every day and all their lives.  </p>

<p>One thing I have learned, though, saying a lot in public about your belief in using your pineal gland is like better not to talk about unless you really have to.  </p>

<p>I have seen things that put tallies on both sides of the issue, but I am either still deciding or not comfortable being frank in this setting but you may never know.   I am reasonably certain that somewhere there are the most bizarre cultists imagineable doing some terrifying shit and another one doing something about the same except they are totally controlled by the spy agency of one or several nations, being milked for visions of the future like psychic cows.  </p>

<p>When you post in r/conspiracy, you have to sortof accept that the people you are ultimately posting FOIA requests about are up to this shit, and maybe if they have brainwave cannons, you&#39;d rather your skull was completely secure in all dimensions/planes.  </p>

<p>It seems reasonable to think, no matter how I wish it were or weren&#39;t, you can spend more time connected to your dreams and imagination and that you way you could possibly connect to good and bad things, and that even if it is or isn&#39;t all inside of you, that you have good and bad parts in you as well, and whoever gets credit for it, at the end of the day, the thing that decides which side of you is going to be evident in your actions, your decisions, is a really easy way to define what you is.  That thing standing there making a decision is ultimately you.  </p>

<p>Or you have lost your mind.  All of this is exactly where the &#39;tin foil hat&#39; thing started in the first place.  The first time you read about the pineal gland, you have to wonder this.  </p>

<p>Because you are the one who will have to experience the pain and regret if you choose poorly.  Another way to define what you is, the thing that hurts when you stub your toe or someone else steps on it.  </p>

<p>I wouldn&#39;t just say that they keep all of these ideas firmly out of the hands of the general population, and persecute heavily those who say these things, but I would say that they actively use them and the fear of them, and they actively propagate chemicals and the environment that put all of these faculties to sleep at times, and at other times trigger them, as in the bizarro cnn/fox intro pieces image/music.  </p>

<p>The actual conspiracy angle on this though is: </p>

<p>So it would be strange to me if they spent all of that time poisoning and deadening and manipulating exactly that faculty if there was nothing to it.....</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Modern day religions covered it up, then demonized everything to do with the opening of the 3rd Eye. Then, a lot of people have taken that thought pattern, initiated since birth, and made anything to do with &quot;spiritualism&quot; evil or voodoo. And because the Freemason&#39;s have the 3rd Eye as a symbol, people also believe it is evil as part of the Secret Society&#39;s in the world. When, one of the main reasons the Masons went &quot;secret&quot; was because they could have been executed for heresy during the Inquistion for believing in something other than the church.</p>

<p>It kind of shocks me that I always read so many things in conspiracy in regards to Pineal glands, secret society&#39;s, 3rd eyes, spiritualism, etc.. and they are always evil. If they would take the time, these types of things are a massive conspiracy against us. Perpetrated by the church and govt&#39;s for 100&#39;s of years. </p>

<p>In Western society yes, but if you talk to Hindu priests/Buddhist monks - it&#39;s business as normal.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It can, yeah. But for some people it can&#39;t. Comes down to a person-to-person basis in the end. If anything I&#39;d actually say take some shrooms, lsd, dmt or ayahuasca in your detox, if you can and want to, even if only once. That would really stimulate your pineal gland. I wouldn&#39;t outright recommend weed in a pineal detox because I know it&#39;s not optimal with me personally. When I smoke weed I can&#39;t dream, and when I can&#39;t dream I can&#39;t lucid dream, and when I can&#39;t lucid dream I can&#39;t astral project. In my opinion, sober mindful practice of both mind and body is the surest way to decalify and to basically wipe the slate clean. That&#39;s something that will work for everyone. To put weed in there might definitely work for some people, but not for others, so for that reason alone I didn&#39;t include it. </p>

<p>I have personally experienced and will testify that switching away from flouridated water affects your abilty to dream, imagine and in general think, in a positive way.  </p>

<p>I believe I got a 5% iq increase when I started drinking reverse osmosis and/or well water.  </p>

<p>Also, when I had my mercury fillings removed, similar benefits but not really realized until I did both.  </p>

<p>There is a gland in your head, whatever you call it, that is where you are when you have dreams at night.  </p>

<p>Other ways to achieve similar things in a semi-waking meditative state are called concentration practice.  </p>

<p>Whether what you see in dreams is all inside your head or is not is, in my opinion, one of the most serious questions in the entire world and behind this question religoins, secret societies, militaries, criminals, the insane and all kinds of people wrestle over every day and all their lives.  </p>

<p>One thing I have learned, though, saying a lot in public about your belief in using your pineal gland is like better not to talk about unless you really have to.  </p>

<p>I have seen things that put tallies on both sides of the issue, but I am either still deciding or not comfortable being frank in this setting but you may never know.   I am reasonably certain that somewhere there are the most bizarre cultists imagineable doing some terrifying shit and another one doing something about the same except they are totally controlled by the spy agency of one or several nations, being milked for visions of the future like psychic cows.  </p>

<p>When you post in r/conspiracy, you have to sortof accept that the people you are ultimately posting FOIA requests about are up to this shit, and maybe if they have brainwave cannons, you&#39;d rather your skull was completely secure in all dimensions/planes.  </p>

<p>It seems reasonable to think, no matter how I wish it were or weren&#39;t, you can spend more time connected to your dreams and imagination and that you way you could possibly connect to good and bad things, and that even if it is or isn&#39;t all inside of you, that you have good and bad parts in you as well, and whoever gets credit for it, at the end of the day, the thing that decides which side of you is going to be evident in your actions, your decisions, is a really easy way to define what you is.  That thing standing there making a decision is ultimately you.  </p>

<p>Or you have lost your mind.  All of this is exactly where the &#39;tin foil hat&#39; thing started in the first place.  The first time you read about the pineal gland, you have to wonder this.  </p>

<p>Because you are the one who will have to experience the pain and regret if you choose poorly.  Another way to define what you is, the thing that hurts when you stub your toe or someone else steps on it.  </p>

<p>I wouldn&#39;t just say that they keep all of these ideas firmly out of the hands of the general population, and persecute heavily those who say these things, but I would say that they actively use them and the fear of them, and they actively propagate chemicals and the environment that put all of these faculties to sleep at times, and at other times trigger them, as in the bizarro cnn/fox intro pieces image/music.  </p>

<p>The actual conspiracy angle on this though is: </p>

<p>So it would be strange to me if they spent all of that time poisoning and deadening and manipulating exactly that faculty if there was nothing to it.....</p>

    <div class="md"><p>First, you can talk about the war on the pineal gland - start with fluoride.  This accumulates and calcifies the pineal gland, diminishing it&#39;s ability, causing sleep loss and other negative side effects.  The pineal gland converts signals between our nervous and endocrine systems (the chakra&#39;s).  It plays a vital part in meditation and dreaming.  </p>

<p>This is like how caffeine (coffee, energy drinks etc) <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=pineal+gland+pinecone&amp;amp;rlz=1C1PQHB_enUS767US767&amp;amp;source=lnms&amp;amp;tbm=isch&amp;amp;sa=X&amp;amp;ved=0ahUKEwj64IrShovbAhVEpFkKHdDVBewQ_AUICigB&amp;amp;biw=1217&amp;amp;bih=930#imgrc=_">damages</a> your adrenal glands (sacral chakra) which regulates your metabolism and immune system.  Vital areas of our body are specifically being targeted. </p>

<p>Your entire body and every thing it can possibly do is being covered up and the pineal gland sitting at the crown helps to regulate it all.  </p>

<p>The pineal gland is depicted throughout history (usually as a <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=pineal+gland+pinecone&amp;amp;rlz=1C1PQHB_enUS767US767&amp;amp;source=lnms&amp;amp;tbm=isch&amp;amp;sa=X&amp;amp;ved=0ahUKEwj64IrShovbAhVEpFkKHdDVBewQ_AUICigB&amp;amp;biw=1217&amp;amp;bih=930#imgrc=_">pinecone</a>).  You can see it at the end of staves, as headdresses and other (usually priestly) ritual objects.  Some researchers believe that the <a href="https://www.ancient-code.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Ancient-Egypt-and-the-Pineal-Gland.jpg">Eye of Horus</a> is a depiction of the brain showing the pituitary and pineal glands.  It is also depicted in more recent art by Alex Grey and others like him.  </p>

<p>The good news is you can de-calcify the pineal gland.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Primary causes of calcification are Halides; chemicals such as Flouride, Chlorine, and Bromide.  Switch to non-fluoride toothpaste. Use a whole home or shower filter for showering. No filter, including reverse osmosis systems, removes all the fluoride out - call your city to get fluoride out of your water. <a href="https://donatenow.networkforgood.org/1415005">https://donatenow.networkforgood.org/1415005</a> Pesticides from conventionally grown fruits and vegetables can have fluoride and other pineal toxins as well.</p>

<p>Calcium can also calcify your pineal gland.  You must take equal amount (or more) of magnesium to properly direct the calcium supplements/intake to your bones.  Most processed foods contain calcium as well, so make sure you get magnesium alogn with it.</p>

<p>Mercury is also bad for the pineal gland.  First, replace any fillings you may have that are mercury-based and switch to ceramic or porcelain fillings.  Next, do not get the flu shot.  It&#39;s effectiveness has been shown to be next-to-nothing but more importantly, per the CDC&#39;s site, it&#39;s still the only vaccine to contain thimersal.  Also, stay away from large fish and bottom feeders that contain mercury.  To detoxify the body from mercury, take chlorella, wheatgrass and spirulina.</p>

<p>Use MSM to help decalcify your pineal gland. Raw Apple Cider Vinegar, citric acid, garlic, iodine (naturally in seaweed) and lots more can help as well balance the pH level of the body as well as leech out toxins.  You can also try chelation techniques which help remove toxic metals out of the body.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>OP, you should read &quot;Not in HIS Image&quot; by John Lash about early Gnosticism. Yes, these Pagan societies and their third eye awareness were destroyed, their libraries burned, their wisdom denied and covered up, replaced by bullshit religions. They were destroyed, I believe, by the &quot;Archons,&quot; a non-human force, in tandem with evil human sellouts. Hence our situation today.</p>

<p>Things are slowly starting to change, and we&#39;re seeing a re-emergence of &quot;animism,&quot; Earth-based spirituality, mostly due to the rising popularity of DMT and ayahuasca. If you&#39;ve never tried it, you really should! Spend some time on <a href="/r/dmt">/r/dmt</a>. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The human body makes crystals in two locations, the human ear, where the hair cells of the inner ear produce calcite carbonate crystals called otoliths and a second more interesting location, the pineal gland.</p>

<p>Interestingly though, the crystals in the pineal gland aren&#39;t calcium carbonate, but calcite. Calcite has a particularly interesting property, it is strongly birefringent, meaning it splits light depending on the polarity of the incoming light, not only that, when hit by light it is piezoelectric, meaning it produces an electrical impulse when hit at certain angles/frequencies. Interesting property when combined with the fact that the pineal gland endogenously produces DMT and a protein called Cry4 which was recently shown to respond to magnetic fields in finches and is known to regulate the circadian rhythm.</p>

<p>So in the end, what is the pineal gland? Could it be doing something like the inner ear but for magnetic fields? Being able to sense subtle changes in Electro-magnetic fields such as the infamous Schumann resonance by learning from quantum interference arising from split light beams coming off many calcite crystals arranged in a pinecone shape?  Does that link us to a larger whole through that Schumann resonance? </p>

<p>Few questions i think might be worth asking.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Its interesting  because I&#39;ve pretty much stumbled on a bunch of answers to really big questions (unified theory of physics, directed panspermia, among others) but they&#39;re not the crAzZy complicated answers people seem to want. Like the pineal gland being an EMF ear, but sadly people want complicated answers so often times the right answers are ignored by something that is more complex.
