        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>This isn&#39;t a fact-based, source-based post at all, I&#39;m just curious of what others think about it. Why is it that SO many pedophile  stories/cover-ups/rumors/etc we hear of come from those in powerful industries - politicians, Hollywood, financers etc? I know other average joes can be pedos too, but they are probably lower level professionals at it.</p>

<p>What I&#39;m getting at is clearly being in power is the way to go as a pedophile - you meet other similar friends, get the hook ups, get the cover ups - so do these people only aim for these types of positions to be able to live their pedo life more freely? They don&#39;t become pedophiles later in life, clearly they go into it as such. Is there some pedo network teaching these tips early on, and how early on is that? You have to know well in advanced to plan this type of future. It&#39;s not a coincidence how prevalent pedophilia is in those industries. To me, it&#39;s some sort of common pre-planned agenda - like how some common people may have <em>high school, college, job, marriage</em> What is theirs and how early on are they taught this plan?</p>

<p>If this is a dumb post please don&#39;t tell me it&#39;s dumb just ignore.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Also, I’m sure someone else can word Smith this better.
But the people in power now, are not the first to be corrupted, they are hundredth in an extremely long lineage and culture of corruption and nefarious deeds. These are the people who pick those below them, those that may take their places one day. </p>

<p>They secure loyalty by blackmail. All these guys are pedos because they have to be, if they weren’t already, that’s how TPTB secure loyalty. Nobody will speak out against them, you’re a filthy pedophile rapist, who would listen to you, scumbag? Nobody, and if you’re lucky enough to find an ear, it will not be an easy road. </p>

<p>It’s systematically flawed and this quagmire needs more than a drain, it needs complete redesign on a fundamental level. It needs to be re-evaluated over and over and over again for any progress to come. </p>

<p>I have had to opportunity to talk to people on multiple fields, musicians, actors, and business people, have all told straight up,  or heavily implied many different things that go on behind the scenes. Specific points a person will come across on their path, that determines if they stay local, or move into the big scene and become famous. </p>

<p>There’s plenty of videos on this, especially rappers talking on sexual abuse and conduct within the game, and it’s true to a major extent. </p>

<p>I just a pissed off ex rapper, but I know the TWO times I met someone truly capable of drastically changing my situation (read: putting me on THE Big Stage) they both asked me for homosexual sex.

    <div class="md"><p>Psychopaths, without any conscience or scruples of any kind, which is what we are actually talking about, come in a lot of different flavours including some which are fixated on illegally molesting and having sex with little children and doing whatever is necessary in order to satisfy that desire and just as importantly... to be able to consistently get away with it, which heightens and makes doing it all the more gratifying for them. </p>

<p>A bold demonstration of just how superior they are compared to everyone else which they also interpret as giving them licence to manipulate or use anyone else in any way that it pleases them to do for their own ends.</p>

<p>With no sense of conscience, guilt, or remorse for anything that they do they are consummate liars and actors, certifiable monsters that move among us putting on a flawless impersonation of the very last people we would ever suspect of harbouring the kind of desires and ambitions that actually drive them. </p>

<p>Suffice it to say that satisfying their personal desires is the only thing of any importance in their lives and everything else is simply a means to that end and they will choose the route that&#39;s most likely to succeed, no matter how hard or difficult and put every possible effort into it while manipulating and using anyone along the way to obtain the kind of advantages that they need to get what they&#39;re after.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Look at the West-backed coups in developing nations. (Literal) criminals are the ones appointed into positions of power, for a few reasons: 1) they select criminals to overthrow the existing government, since this base is most inclined to do so, and 2) the West has constant leverage against the new govt&#39;s administration. Kosovo&#39;s current president Thaci was described by the US State Dept as a narco thug, until Europe&#39;s leadership convinced the US to back him instead of Albania&#39;s other (slightly less) criminal leader.</p>

<p>Haiti is another obvious example of supporting criminals in the coups and then helping them rise to long-term power, but it&#39;s been done throughout Central America, former USSR countries, the Baltics, etc. Pedos and those with unusual sexual proclivities make for the most blackmailable. They also help run the covert human trafficking businesses, not all too different than appointing drug lords as presidents for covert drug ops in/out of the country. </p>

<p>Bullying is stealing spiritual energy from other beings by making them feel negative emotional states and absorbing the negative energy they radiate.

Children are easy prey and also yield a lot of negative emotional energy because they are more sensitive. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Being a pedophile is a prerequisite to power. In this system, blackmail is the best way to control people. They pick people, the elites, who have are sexually deviant and are child molesters, and they have them perform &#39;rituals&#39;, tape it, and hold it over them so that way they have complete power with these people. It&#39;s in every area of business, education, religion, and politics.</p>

<p>And then you have child molesters that pick jobs where they can be close to children to prey on them, hence teachers, daycare workers and so forth, have been found recently to engage in these predatory behaviors. So it&#39;s two aspects to it. </p>

<p>Once you have the blackmail material, you approach the nice-looking guy or gal, and tell them that you want to support them running for office. If they object, you let them know about the video. And the nice-looking guy or gal does whatever you say for their entire political career.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You are seeing the wrong way.</p>

<p>The question is if they are in powerful positions bc of their pedophilia or if they are pedophile bc of their powerful Position.</p>

<p>If I rember correctly most sexual crimes against children is not done by actual pedophiles but people who have power over the children (teachers, fathers, uncles etc.).</p>

<p>Also another possibility I want to add that there are far more pedophiles or people who have interest in stuff like this in the world but we only see the real outliners that actually do it (so people who have a very high pedofile desire) or people whos Position allowed them to be pedophiles. </p>

<p>Yes, most child abuse is perpetrated by people known to the child and in positions of power over them, but they don&#39;t abuse the child because they&#39;re in that position, they abuse the child because they&#39;re a paedophile or a sadist or a psychopath.</p>

<p>A pedo has developed skills in manipulation, building trust, grooming behavior in others to serve their interests, how to be an asshole while making the victim feel responsible, how to be charming, how to maintain relationships for selfish purposes.  In the obvious absence of morals, the same skills can lead to success in business, social circles, etc. </p>

<p>Why is it that SO many pedophile stories/cover-ups/rumors/etc we hear of come from those in powerful industries ...?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Because people love making up and spreading scurrilous gossip over famous people. If you claim that some A-list actor is a child abuser, that&#39;s going to get a much bigger reaction (and more page views, if you have a website) than accusing some teacher that no one&#39;s heard of. </p>

<p>But when it comes down to whether the powerful industries are more represented in actual proven instances of child abuse as opposed to allegations, I&#39;ve not seen any figures that show this is the case. (And, as you note, your claim is not fact based or sourced.) I would actually expect that organisations like schools, sports groups, and youth groups are more represented than &quot;powerful industries&quot;, because child abuse is generally committed by adults known to the child and in positions of power over them (teachers, sports coaches, priests, etc).</p>

<p>I suspect there is a history of all sorts of people throughout history who realized it’s easier to corrupt the powerful, and or blackmail them, then to grasp for power themselves, directly. </p>

<p>Favour hoarders are probably a common starting point. Crassus, way back in republican Rome was one. So is Epstein. I hate to say it, but it follows a fairly logical progression. </p>

<p>Wealth can bring moral degeneration. Ancient Persia in one generation (maybe 2) went from men eat only once a day to funk it, let’s have an all day/night feast. The mongols saw this and kept sending their men back to the steppes. Yo keep their edge. Those who didn’t acculturated and lost that hard edge. </p>
