        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>A book that alleges there was a meeting in the 1890s to discuss the Jewish plan for global domination.</p>

<p>This book is one of the biggest conspiracy in our lifetime, rarely gets mentioned on this sub. </p>

<p>Many people complain about the book and call it a hoax and forgery. They will usually admit that they&#39;ve never read the book, so I guess that is why [Reader] made an audiobook; so people could listen to an mp3 (link at bottom) and make an informed decision as to whether the book is true or a hoax. </p>

<p>My take is this: whether the meeting was real or not, everything seems to be coming true, word for word.</p>

<p>One page summary reads as followed:</p>

<h1>Goyim are mentally inferior to Jews and can’t run their nations properly. For their sake and ours, we need to abolish their governments and replace them with a single government. This will take a long time and involve much bloodshed, but it’s for a good cause. Here’s what we’ll need to do:</h1>

<ul>
<li><h1>Place our agents and helpers everywhere</h1></li>
<li><h1>Take control of the media and use it in propaganda for our plans</h1></li>
<li><h1>Start fights between different races, classes and religions</h1></li>
<li><h1>Use bribery, threats and blackmail to get our way</h1></li>
<li><h1>Use Freemasonic Lodges to attract potential public officials</h1></li>
<li><h1>Appeal to successful people’s egos</h1></li>
<li><h1>Appoint puppet leaders who can be controlled by blackmail</h1></li>
<li><h1>Replace royal rule with socialist rule, then communism, then despotism</h1></li>
<li><h1>Abolish all rights and freedoms, except the right of force by us</h1></li>
<li><h1>Sacrifice people (including Jews sometimes) when necessary</h1></li>
<li><h1>Eliminate religion; replace it with science and materialism</h1></li>
<li><h1>Control the education system to spread deception and destroy intellect</h1></li>
<li><h1>Rewrite history to our benefit</h1></li>
<li><h1>Create entertaining distractions</h1></li>
<li><h1>Corrupt minds with filth and perversion</h1></li>
<li><h1>Encourage people to spy on one another</h1></li>
<li><h1>Keep the masses in poverty and perpetual labor</h1></li>
<li><h1>Take possession of all wealth, property and (especially) gold</h1></li>
<li><h1>Use gold to manipulate the markets, cause depressions etc.</h1></li>
<li><h1>Introduce a progressive tax on wealth</h1></li>
<li><h1>Replace sound investment with speculation</h1></li>
<li><h1>Make long-term interest-bearing loans to governments</h1></li>
<li><h1>Give bad advice to governments and everyone else</h1></li>
</ul>

<h1>Eventually the Goyim will be so angry with their governments (because we’ll blame them for the resulting mess) that they’ll gladly have us take over. We will then appoint a descendant of David to be king of the world, and the remaining Goyim will bow down and sing his praises. Everyone will live in peace and obedient order under his glorious rule.</h1>

<p>Henry Ford funded printing of 500,000 copies that were distributed throughout the United States in the 1920s. The Nazis sometimes used the Protocols as propaganda against Jews; it was assigned by some German teachers, as if factual, to be read by German schoolchildren.</p>

<p>Who ever wrote the book, did it in the name of zionists. If the story is real, that would mean, Zionists had a meeting to discuss what they are going to do and this book was the result, if it&#39;s a fake, the book was the result from of antisemitic propaganda. Which one it is, we don&#39;t know.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you compare the book with reality, then yeah, it&#39;s hard not to believe it&#39;s true, but the book is around for some time. Many of the ideas in the book are even older. It could have been any group of people who read this book in the meantime, that realised all those ideas while blaming Zionists. Or maybe the book was written by antisemites, but when the Zionists read that book, they were all like &quot;Hell lets give it a try&quot; xD Hell, I don&#39;t know.</p>

<p>The wikipedia article (claiming it&#39;s fake of course) sounds legit as well. I really don&#39;t know. :)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>In the original version, the plan was being enacted by Jesuits, not Jews. It was repackaged as a Zionist plot by whoever edited it to become The Protocols. For the longest time it was believed that Mason and Jesuits were plotting to take over the world this way, and the Jews were not. If we talk about a historical &quot;plan&quot; like this then we should try to put it in the actual context of the history, not prejudices that have occurred more recently. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t think we need to question ALL of western history to such an extent that we have to ignore historical events that have a range of sources and contextual information. By all means question the moral worth of that evidence and historical event, but just because the establishment controls history doesn&#39;t mean that it&#39;s all lies. </p>

<p>If this plan has existed for centuries then there&#39;s an added problem since the social situations spoken about in the Protocols simply didn&#39;t exist prior to the 1700&#39;s. In my version of this thing, the original book was attacking both the Jesuits and the new social situations which were perceived as morally questionable. Then some dude came along and made an easy fake, using a bunch of books he had found translated into Russian. Some of the ideas in the book simply don&#39;t work anymore and had stopped being good ideas for taking over the world by 1900 because the social situation had changed since they were thought up in the 1840&#39;s. </p>

<p>We can see this throughout, but look at <a href="https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/The_Protocols_of_the_Learned_Elders_of_Zion#Protocol_XV_Ruthless_Suppression">Protocol XV Ruthless Suppression</a>. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>we shall create and multiply free masonic lodges in all the countries of  the world, absorb into them all who may become or who are prominent in  public activity, for in these lodges we shall find our principal  intelligence office and means of influence. All these lodges we shall  bring under one central administration, known to us alone and to all  others absolutely unknown, which will be composed of our learned elders.  The lodges will have their representatives who will serve to screen the  above-mentioned administration of masonry and from whom will issue the  watchword and programme. In these lodges we shall tie together the knot  which binds together all revolutionary and liberal elements. Their  composition will be made up of all strata of society. The most secret  political plots will be known to us and will fall under our guiding  hands on the very day of their conception. Among the members of these  lodges will be almost all the agents of international and national  police since their service is for us irreplaceable in the respect that  the police is in a position not only to use its own particular measures  with the insubordinate, but also to screen our activities and provide  pretexts for discontents, et cetera. The class of people who most  willingly enter into secret societies are those who live by their wits,  careerists, and in general people, mostly light-minded, with whom we  shall have no difficulty in dealing and in using to wind up the  mechanism of the machine devised by us. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>It&#39;s defining Masonic Lodges as revolutionary and liberal, as sites of revolutionary intrigue, where &quot;those who live by their wits, careerists, and light-minded people&quot; accumulate to advance liberal ideas. By the 1900&#39;s Masonic lodges were nothing like this, and today are even more different. The common conspiracy theory is that Masonic lodges are sites of inherited wealth, where conservatism and the Old Right, conspire to reestablish the older ways of prestige. </p>

<p>Why are Zionists using the liberal revolutionary character of a set of people defined as reactionary conservatives? Why should we fear or care that Zionists want to use Masonic Lodges to advance liberal ideas, when lodges have become less and and less powerful or important? </p>

<p>And how do you interpret this extract:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>On no account should so much as a single unit above the definite and  freely estimated sums be retained in the State treasuries, for money  exists to be circulated and any kind of stagnation of money acts  ruinously on the running of the State machinery, for which it is the  lubricant; a stagnation of the lubricant may stop the regular working of  the mechanism. The substitution of interest-bearing paper for a part of  the token of exchange has produced exactly this stagnation. The  consequences of this circumstance are already sufficiently noticeable.  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Or...</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Economic crises have been produced by us from the goyim by no other  means than the withdrawal of money from circulation. Huge capitals have  stagnated, withdrawing money from States, which were constantly obliged  to apply to those same stagnant capitals for loans. These loans burdened  the finances of the State with the payment of interest and made them the bond slaves of  these capitals. . . The concentration of industry in the hands of  capitalists out of the hands of small masters has drained away all the  juices of the peoples and with them also of the States. The present  issue of money in general does not correspond with the requirements per  head, and cannot therefore satisfy all the needs of the workers. The  issue of money ought to correspond with the growth of population and  thereby children also must absolutely be reckoned as consumers of  currency from the day of their birth.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is a poorly thought out economic argument, but exists as the center piece of the Protocols. The amount of money in circulation doesn&#39;t have a direct affect on the well being of the economy. This is the argument that Reagan and Thatcher tried to explore with all the financial reforms in the 1980&#39;s. It is the reduction of money in circulation doesn&#39;t cause economic crises, and increasing the money supply (which is what the Protocols are suggesting should be the way independent non-Zionists controlled economies would be doing) doesn&#39;t make an economy healthier. </p>

<p>Or, look at some other parts of the plan. Here is a single paragraph that I&#39;ve broken up. It&#39;s one aspect of what the Protocols says they are doing to undermine society.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>That the peoples may become accustomed to obedience it is necessary to  inculcate lessons of humility and therefore to reduce the production of  articles of luxury. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Didn&#39;t happen. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>By this we shall improve morals which have been  debased by emulation in the sphere of luxury. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Didn&#39;t happen.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>We shall re-establish  small master production which will mean laying a mine under the private  capital of manufacturers.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Nope.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This is indispensable also for the reason that  manufacturers on the grand scale often move, though not always  consciously, the thoughts of the masses in directions against the  government. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>No they don&#39;t. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>A people of small masters knows nothing of unemployment and  this binds him closely with existing order, and consequently with the  firmness of authority. Unemployment is a most perilous thing for a  government.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No, it isn&#39;t. Not anymore. It was thought that unemployment was dangerous to a government in the 1700&#39;s, but subsequent governments have seen that allowing unemployment to rise actually helps the economy and engenders lower levels of dissent. It was actually in repressive and authoritarian forced employment that governments experiences a lot more problems. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>For us its part will have been played out the moment  authority is transferred into our hands. Drunkenness also will be  prohibited by law and punishable as a crime against the humanness of man  who is turned into a brute under the influence of alcohol. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Oh that doesn&#39;t seem right. </p>

<p>So I don&#39;t know. If this is real (AND IT ISN&quot;T) it isn&#39;t a well thought out idea. It seems to be more specifically looking at society in the late 1700&#39;s and early 1800&#39;s, and probably have such little baring on our lives today for us to ignore it entirely. </p>

<p>Great logic.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hey!  Since you are interested here, make it academic!  Read the Protocols, Read Nietzsche (best to just read a book of selections from his overall writing to get the whole picture without being overwhelmed) Read “The Prince” by Machiavelli, Read some of the criticisms of Julius Caesar by Cicero and also some of the critiques of Constantine the Great by various contemporaries.</p>

<p>Then, compare and see if there is <em>a single bit</em> of new or intriguing information in the Protocols.</p>

<p>That sounds like a lot of work, but that is actual research.</p>

<p>The reason I suggest it is that <em>it really doesn’t matter if the book is a forgery or not because all of these tactics have been variously known, suggested, criticized or made as accusations against people</em>!  Meaning that even if the Protocols is real, they didn’t do anything but copy the overall “Western Civilization’s Grand Blueprint for World Domination” that was discussed in writing since Roman antiquity!

<p>Although first published in Russia in 1903, the Protocols of Zion had their origin in France and date from the Dreyfus Affair, of which the Jesuits were the chief instigators.  They were planned also first to take effect in France, by the overthrow of the &quot;Judaic-Masonic&quot; government of the French Republic.  But the discovery of the gigantic fraud of Leo Taxil, who had been openly supported by the Jesuits, the concluding of the Franco-Russian alliance, along with the Vatican&#39;s difficulties with the French government at that time, made it more opportune to have them appear first in Russia.</p>

<p>These Protocols of supposedly Jewish leaders are not the first documents of their kind fabricated by the Jesuits.</p>

<p>For over a hundred years before these Protocols appeared, the Jesuits had continued to make use of a similar fraud called &quot;The Secrets of the Elders of Bourg-Fontaine&quot;  against Jansenism-- a liberal French Catholic movement among the secular clergy.   The analogy between the two forgeries is perfect-- the secret assemblage in the forest of Bourg-Fontaine, the plan of the &quot;conspirators&quot; to destroy the Papacy and establish religious tolerance among all nations, the alleged plot against Throne and Altar, and the setting up of a world-government in opposition to the Catholic Church.  There is the same dramatization of the negative pole of the historic evolution of the world, in order to bring out, by contrast, the positive Christian (Catholic) pole, around which all conservative forces-- the monarchy, the aristocracy, the army, the clergy-- must gather to save the world from Satan&#39;s onslaught.</p>

<p>Analyzing, therefore, the ends to be attained by these Protocols of Zion, the means to be employed, the forces depicted as evil and those to be considered good, we must reach the conclusion that only to those, whose objectives these forgeries were clearly intended to serve, can their authorship be attributed.</p>

<p>And since the Jesuits invented the modern antisemitic movement in their <em>La Civilta Cattolica</em> journal in the late 1800s, the Protocols were a direct extension of this political antisemitic movement of the Jesuits - to be sure, the primary distributors of the Protocols in France were Catholic priests. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Putting aside fine phrases we shall speak of the significance of each  thought: by comparisons and deductions we shall throw light upon  surrounding facts. What I am about to set forth, then, is our system  from the two point[s] of view, that of ourselves and that of the goyim.  </p>

<p>It must be noted that men with bad instincts are more in number than  the good, and therefore the best results in governing them are attained  by violence and terrorization, and not by academic discussions. Every  man aims at power, everyone would like to become a dictator if only he  could, and rare indeed are the men who would not be willing to sacrifice  the welfare of all for the sake of securing their own welfare. What has  restrained the beasts of prey who are called men? What has served for  their guidance hitherto?  </p>

<p>In the beginnings of the structure of society they were subjected to  brutal and blind force; afterwards -- to Law, which is the same force,  only disguised. I draw the conclusion that by the law of nature right  lies in force.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And here is the corresponding section from the Dialogues...</p>

<blockquote>
<p>thus let us leave words and comparisons so that we can concern ourselves with ideas. Here is how I formulate my system and I doubt that you can weaken it, because it is only made up of deductions from moral and political facts of an eternal truth: bad instincts among men are more powerful than the good ones. Man has more enthusiasm for evil than for good; fear and force have more control over him than reason. I do not stop to demonstrate such truths; only the scatterbrained coterie of Baron Holbach -- in which was the apostle -- has contradicted them. All men aspire to domination and there is none who would not be an oppressor if he could; all or almost all are ready to sacrifice the rights of others for their own interests.  </p>

<p>What restrains the devouring animals that one calls men? At the origin of society, there was brutal and unchecked force; later it was the law, that is to say, force still, ruled by forms. You have consulted all the sources of history; everywhere force appears before rights.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So I&#39;ll show it again, this time I&#39;ll highlight come words so we can see clearly.</p>

What has served for  their guidance hitherto?</em>  </p>

<p><em>In the beginnings of the structure of society they were subjected to  brutal and blind force; afterwards -- to Law, which is the same force,  only disguised. I draw the conclusion that by the law of nature right  lies in force.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Dialogues...</p>

<blockquote>
<p>(1) <strong>Thus let us leave words and comparisons so that we can concern ourselves with ideas.</strong> Here is how I formulate my system and I doubt that you can weaken it, because it is only made up of deductions from moral and political facts of an eternal truth: (2) <em>bad instincts among men are more powerful than the good ones. Man has more enthusiasm for evil than for good; fear and force have more control over him than reason</em>. I do not stop to demonstrate such truths; only the scatterbrained coterie of Baron Holbach -- in which was the apostle -- has contradicted them. (3) <strong>All men aspire to domination and there is none who would not be an oppressor if he could; all or almost all are ready to sacrifice the rights of others for their own interests.</strong>  </p>

<p>(4) <em>What restrains the devouring animals that one calls men? At the origin of society, there was brutal and unchecked force; later it was the law, that is to say, force still, ruled by forms. You have consulted all the sources of history; everywhere force appears before rights.;</em></p>

<p>So translations are off a little, but the basic ideas are the same and the sentences are constructed in much the same way, leading to the same argument. </p>

    <div class="md"><p><strong>FIRST</strong>, I would like to thank you for the effort you put into your reply -- and for your patience in awaiting my response...</p>

<blockquote>
<p>So I am having an issue with the different translations, so this may not work as well for me as I imagined. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>I suspect that the &quot;issue&quot; you are confronted with has less to do with &quot;translation&quot;, and more to do with having believed the incessantly repeated HYPE insisting that <em>Proptocolis Zionistas</em> was, as you earlier stated, a <em>&quot;forgery&quot;</em> and  <em>&quot;was taken almost entirely&quot;</em> from the works of Maurice Joly et al. </p>

<p>And why shouldn&#39;t you have believed that assertion? After all, it has been repeated incessantly and aggressively for nearly a Century... What was it that the Nazi guy with the truncated mustache said about THE BIG LIE, all those years ago? <em>(look it up and read it - in context)</em></p>

<p>Anyway, you had heard the claim repeated so often and with such religious fervency so often and for so long that you were SURE that it MUST be true -- -- right?</p>

<p>But when I asked you to cite the <strong><em>specific sections</em></strong> that had <em>allegedly been plagiarized</em>, you found the assertions to be wanting -- FABRICATED, even. </p>

<p>Dread not, friend. I was confronted with the same SHOCKING revelation years ago.</p>

<p>Indeed, on investigation, I discovered that the alleged &quot;plagiarisms&quot; in the Protocols turned out to be little more than loose paraphrases - one author expressing similar concepts, ideas and notions that had been expressed in the <em>alleged</em> work of another author -- Joly, in his biting satirical prose... No?</p>

<p>Well, as the saying goes, <em>&quot;you learn something new every day&quot;</em>, and TODAY I LEARNED <em>(and you will too)</em> that at the height of the Protocol Frenzy, JOLY HIMSELF had been accused of harboring and expressing &quot;anti-Semitic&quot; sentiments, an accusation that was NOT well received by those who were intimately familiar with Maurice, his beliefs, and his works.</p>

<p>Behold, I present a letter to the editor of <strong><em>The Spectator</em></strong>, <strong><em>penned September 10, 1921</em></strong>, the author of which stood firmly in the DEFENSE of Joly, and made some VERY interesting revelations in the process.</p>

<p>From the Spectator Archives:</p>

<p><a href="http://archive.spectator.co.uk/article/10th-september-1921/16/maurice-joly-and-the-jews">MAURICE JOLY AND THE JEWS</a> -- 10 SEPTEMBER 1921, Page 16</p>

<p><em>[Added emphasis is mine, BTW]</em></p>

<p>QUOTE</p>

<hr/>

<p>[To THE EDITOR or THE &quot; SPECTATOR.&quot;] SIR,—My knowledge of the book called The Jewish Peril is practically limited to the reading of a few reviews of it in Periodical publications, <strong><em>but I may say that it is a great mistake to drag in the name of the Frenchman Maurice Joly as an enemy of the Jewish people.</em></strong> He had certainly no love for Napoleon III. and the Bonapartist party in France, but otherwise a more tolerant man never lived. Maurice Joly was a very intimate friend of my father, the late Victor de Ternant, who often told me that <strong>the &quot;Montesquieu-Machia- velli&quot; book was revised and largely rewritten for publication by Jules Janin, of the Journal des Debats,</strong> <strong><em>and was issued at the expense of a wealthy German-Jewish banker in Switzer- land.</em></strong> There was also a question of an English translation by Blanchard Jerrold (who made some progress with his work) for the now extinct firm of David Bogue, but the project was subsequently abandoned.—I am, Sir, &amp;o., ANDREW DE TERNANT.</p>

<p>36 Somerleyton Road, Brixton, S.W.</p>

<hr/>

<p>END QUOTE</p>

<p>First, I would consider that the CONTENT of the above letter to the editor of The Spectator is very likely genuine -- as there are probably numerous copies existing in various archives that could be cross-referenced for accuracy, NO?</p>

<p>But there remains the issue of the credulity of the individual who WROTE said letter, AND that of those who were (allegedly) involved in PUBLISHING the (allegedly edited) work of Maurice Joly... specifically, <em>&quot;Jules Janin, of the Journal des Debats&quot;</em>, and a Jewish International Banker abiding in Sunderland, (who &quot;ANDREW DE TERNANT&quot; does not name.</p>

<p>So, with two contradictory claims, who is being deceptive, AND WHAT WAS THE 
LIKELY MOIVATION?</p>

<p>Recalling his assertions: </p>

<p><em>&quot;largely rewritten for publication&quot;</em>??? </p>

<p><em>&quot;issued at the expense of a wealthy German-Jewish banker in Switzerland&quot;</em>???</p>

<p>What might have been the motives of de Ternant? To defend the &quot;honor&quot; of a man who had THEN been dead for over 40 years?</p>

<p>Contrast these to the motives of the unnamed German Banker living in Switzerland, and those of <a href="https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jules_Janin"><strong>Jules Janin</strong></a> the man that de Ternant insistsed was behind the publishing of a MODIFIED version of Joly&#39;s work -- at the behest (and expense) of an International Banker with notable Ethnic Significance.</p>

<p>(-<em>-)  (-</em>-)</p>

<p>Finally, I am NOT definitively stating that the Protocols are &quot;genuine&quot;. (did we het that, TMOR?)</p>

<p>What I AM stating is that the &quot;evidence&quot; that has been cited ad nauseam for nearly 100 years to CLAIM that the Protocols are a &quot;forgery&quot; is overhyped vacuous nonsense.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>But here the opening of the Protocols, as it appears on Wikisource...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The thing is that <em>because the Nazi’s mentioned it</em> it is considered automatically discredited.</p>

<p>The other thing about it is that everything in it is painfully obvious!  The points you list pretty much applied to society since <em>the Renaissance!</em></p>

<p>I have never “investigated” it, and the reason I use quotation marks is that, to everyone’s detriment, these days there is an all too common and pernicious idiocy among <em>all people</em> that “researching” something <em>involves looking it up online and watching YouTube videos or reading other people’s claims of research and taking them as fact</em>.</p>

<p>Real research involves looking at <em>physical manuscripts</em> and seeking <em>primary sources</em>.</p>

<p>It is likely not a coincidence at all that as the propaganda ramps up and the internet is ever more censored and rewritten on the fly, that people are loosing the knowledge of how to do actual research and separate fact from fiction.</p>

<p>This doesn’t apply just to people here, <em>it is rampant in academia</em>!!  That is correct, thee was a study not long ago (posted by the authors on... I want to say it was “r/dataisbeautiful”) where they analyzed citations in papers published in prestigious journals and found <em>many</em> instances of “circular citation” (where there is no primary source, the info has no credibility other than the fact that it was cited and cross-cited so many times!) </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That was 100 years ago. Just look at the communist revolution in 1918 in Russia. Jews were behind it using basically the same tactics as protocols. Resulted in 1/4 of all Russians dead. Many worked to death in work camps. 20 million people. They want you to believe Stalin was an antisemite. That&#39;s bullshit. Most ranks were Jewish. They started the revolution. They took positions of power. Then... </p>

<p>Not every position was Jewish but the vast majority was and it was definitely disproportionate. </p>

<p>Then you look at the communist party of Germany and the civil war in the 1918. Same shit. It was led by Jews. France similar story.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Part 1:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In the protocols the use of the word &quot;progressive&quot; doesn&#39;t mean incrementally higher, but radical, new, and revolutionary.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This statement is factually incorrect.  It <em>almost</em> gets used this way on two separate occasions, which I will give you, but again it is only <em>almost</em>.</p>

<p>Take a look with me at these particular instances of the word &quot;progressive.&quot;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>4) The method adopted for first weakening and then destroying existing bodies politic is the infusion of disintegrating political ideas of <strong>carefully measured</strong> progressive disruptive force, <strong>from</strong> liberalism <strong>to</strong> radicalism, and socialism <strong>to</strong> communism, <strong>culminating in</strong> anarchy as a reductio ad absurdum</p>
</blockquote>

<p>While here we do see the word &quot;progressive&quot; used within a context of increasing radicalization as a means to an end we also see, more importantly, that the truth is exactly the opposite of what you have presented. </p>

<p>&quot;Carefully measured... from... to... culminating in,&quot; is precisely the language of &quot;incrementally higher.  </p>

<p>Let&#39;s look at the other example I am seeing.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The part of liberal idealists will be definitely terminated when our government is recognised. Until then they will do us good service. For this reason we will try to direct the public mind towards every kind of <strong>fantastic theory which could appear progressive or or liberal.</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>See, almost.  But neither progressives nor liberals of the era were &quot;radical, new, revolutionary.&quot;  The section continues with the word progress again used to mean, &quot;incrementally higher.&quot;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It was we who, with complete success, turned the brainless heads of the Gentiles by our theories of <strong>progress towards</strong> socialism; </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Reading again, and I want to emphasize this point, the author(s) illustrate for us that to their way of thinking progress is anything but, &quot;radical, new and revolutionary.&quot;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>there is not to be found a brain among the Gentiles which would perceive that in every instance, behind the word <strong>&quot;progress&quot; is hidden a deviation from the truth</strong>, except in such cases where this word refers to scientific discoveries. For <strong>there is but one true teaching</strong>, and in it there is <strong>no room for &quot;progress.&quot;</strong> </p>
</blockquote>

<p>And then check the last part of the paragraph:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Progress</strong>, like a false idea, <strong>serves to conceal the truth</strong> in order that nobody should know truth besides ourselves</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So we see now clearly that &quot;progress,&quot; even when used in a political sense, is merely an inversion of truth shading the fact that there is no progress.  </p>

<p>Inverted truth, if you will.  </p>

<p>Much like what you&#39;ve presented thus far.  I hope that this trend does not continue with you.  It is exhausting to &#39;discuss&#39; issues of controversy with people who believe such dissimulation of facts and definitions is acceptable.</p>

<p>Alright, back to the meat of this discussion:  Progressive taxation.</p>

<p>I&#39;m hesitant to take your word for it, and by now if anyone is reading along they should be too.</p>

<p>So instead of simply believing you about what the Protocols, &quot;suggests (weasel word),&quot; take a quick look with me at a the passages concerning progressive taxation.  </p>

<p>What I see sounds nearly identical to current justifications for our system of progressive taxation (in fact it is very similar to our existing system of progressive taxation) which is interesting, but nothing I see does much to validate your statement re: &quot;The richer should pay vastly more taxes.&quot;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>20.5. </p>

<p>Hence the best means to meet government expenses will be by a <strong>progressive taxation</strong> of property. Thus, <strong>taxation will be paid without oppressing or ruining</strong> the people and the <strong>amount</strong> at which it will be assessed will <strong>depend on the value of each individual property.</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>We have those now.  They&#39;re called property taxes.  </p>

<p>[Quick breakdown:  ((Property Value x Assessment Rate) - Exemptions) x Property Tax Rate = Tax Bill. ] </p>

<p>While I would like to point out the use the use word, &quot;Progressive,&quot; here to mean the amount owed to the state assessed based on the value of the property, the more important here is that, &quot;The richer paying vastly more,&quot; is unsupported.  Such a system, just as we see today, levies taxes on everyone whether they&#39;re the proud owner of a tiny piece of dirt with a busted shanty or an opulent mansion surrounded by opulent gardens.</p>

<p>The catch is that you pay a more for the mansion, but even the shanty has its cost.  It continues:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>20.6. </p>

<p>It must be understood by the rich that it is their duty to hand over <strong>part of their surplus wealth</strong> to the government, because the <strong>government guarantees them safe possession</strong> of the remainder of their property and gives them the right to earn money by honest means. I say honest, because the control of property will preclude robbery on legal grounds. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Once again exactly the arguments advanced by proponents of our current system of progressive taxation, and again it does not amount to, &quot;The richer paying vastly more.&quot;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>20.10. Progressive taxation assessed according to the fortune of the individual will produce a much larger revenue than the present system of taxing everybody at an equal rate.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Once again, &quot;Progressive taxation,&quot; used exactly as it is today.  The more money you have the more money you pay.  There is nothing, &quot;Radical, new, revolutionary,&quot; about it.</p>

<p>I&#39;m getting ready to wrap this up, so let us read over the last mention of progressive taxation.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>20.17. There will be a <strong>progressive stamp duty on all sales and purchases as well as death duties.</strong> Any transaction without the required stamp will be considered illegal, and the former owner will be obliged to pay to the government a percentage on the duty from the date of the sale. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>As even you should know by now, with sales tax the more you spend the more you pay.  And sales tax hits everyone.</p>

<p>As a nod to &quot;the poor,&quot; for what it&#39;s worth (very little), they do through up one quick empty platitude:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>20.8. Taxation of the poor is the origin of all revolution and always greatly conducive to injury to the Government, as the latter, while trying to raise money from the poor, loses its chance of obtaining it from the rich. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>This sounds nice and all, but it says nothing about who constitutes, &quot;The poor,&quot; and none of the property, sales, or taxes on wealth outline any exemptions for low income households.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>A progressive tax on wealth where the rich pay a small percentage more which in effect becomes a lot more money is the complete opposite of what the protocols of The Elders of Zion.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yet another inversion of the truth as outlined above.  </p>

<p>I&#39;m done.  Enjoy your week.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So I am having an issue with the different translations, so this may not work as well for me as I imagined. But here the opening of the Protocols, as it appears on Wikisource...</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Putting aside fine phrases we shall speak of the significance of each  thought: by comparisons and deductions we shall throw light upon  surrounding facts. What I am about to set forth, then, is our system  from the two point[s] of view, that of ourselves and that of the goyim.  </p>

<p>It must be noted that men with bad instincts are more in number than  the good, and therefore the best results in governing them are attained  by violence and terrorization, and not by academic discussions. Every  man aims at power, everyone would like to become a dictator if only he  could, and rare indeed are the men who would not be willing to sacrifice  the welfare of all for the sake of securing their own welfare. What has  restrained the beasts of prey who are called men? What has served for  their guidance hitherto?  </p>

<p>In the beginnings of the structure of society they were subjected to  brutal and blind force; afterwards -- to Law, which is the same force,  only disguised. I draw the conclusion that by the law of nature right  lies in force.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And here is the corresponding section from the Dialogues...</p>

<blockquote>
<p>thus let us leave words and comparisons so that we can concern ourselves with ideas. Here is how I formulate my system and I doubt that you can weaken it, because it is only made up of deductions from moral and political facts of an eternal truth: bad instincts among men are more powerful than the good ones. Man has more enthusiasm for evil than for good; fear and force have more control over him than reason. I do not stop to demonstrate such truths; only the scatterbrained coterie of Baron Holbach -- in which was the apostle -- has contradicted them. All men aspire to domination and there is none who would not be an oppressor if he could; all or almost all are ready to sacrifice the rights of others for their own interests.  </p>

<p>What restrains the devouring animals that one calls men? At the origin of society, there was brutal and unchecked force; later it was the law, that is to say, force still, ruled by forms. You have consulted all the sources of history; everywhere force appears before rights.</p>

<p>So I&#39;ll show it again, this time I&#39;ll highlight come words so we can see clearly.</p>

<p>Protocols </p>

<blockquote>
<p>(1) <strong>Putting aside fine phrases we shall speak of the significance of each  thought:</strong> by comparisons and deductions we shall throw light upon  surrounding facts.

<p>So translations are off a little, but the basic ideas are the same and the sentences are constructed in much the same way, leading to the same argument. </p>
