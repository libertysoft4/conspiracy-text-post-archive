    <div class="md"><p>I recovered too. But only when I really stopped and really thought about it. Most people are taught their religion from birth, so they never really stop to think about it or question it. They are so busy with their life (kids, work, etc.) that they just don&#39;t think about it. (That was me.) But one day they will really think about it, don&#39;t worry, and realize the truth.</p>

<p>So I don&#39;t necessary think they are mentally ill. Although, some of them are, but not the majority.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s psychosis, plain and simple.  Belief which has no basis in evidence, and which usually runs contrary to the evidence available.  In most cases it&#39;s a fairly mild disorder, but in more serious cases it leads to a lifelong pattern of irrational decision making.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Okay, I see what you are saying. I believe in reincarnation, but there is no proof of it being real. But I like to think it is real.</p>

<p>Honestly, NO ONE knows what happens when we die. I believe there is something after this life, but I can&#39;t prove it and I really don&#39;t know what it is. I&#39;m not mentally ill. I&#39;m just honest.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, from my perspective you are mentally ill to some degree because you believe in something for which there is no evidence.  I don&#39;t say that to be offensive, because I have a great deal of respect for you, but in my opinion any belief which is not evidence based is mental illness.  Generally, its probably a fairly harmless psychosis, at least up to the point where that belief starts to factor in your decision making processes.</p>

<p>I agree.  No one knows, and furthermore there is no basis for speculation.  I suspect there&#39;s nothing after death, because all the available evidence points toward the universe being mechanistic and utterly uncaring, but I don&#39;t <em>believe</em> there is nothing after death because there is no evidence for that either.  There may be a God of sorts, but as their is no evidence of such I make no statements of belief or disbelief.  These things are inherently unknowable, and there&#39;s no point wasting thoughts on them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p><em>...and you proved my point.</em> </p>

<p>How is believing in a religion a mental disorder, but, believing you are attracted to the same sex, not? Believing in the latter, goes against biology/reality (dicks and vaginas go together to create new humans), whereas the former... does not. Furthermore, there are far more cases of sexual abuse from Homosexuals, than there are for religious people. How many Homosexuals were abused by male figures in their lives? The numbers are through the roof. Right there, shows sexual trauma/damage to the brain (ie. mental disorder). </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Because religious belief has no basis in reality.  There is no evidence whatsoever to support the belief that a god or gods exist, and less than no evidence to suggest that such a being would be anthropomorphic or give two shits about the human species.  </p>

<p>Belief in a god is completely arbitrary.  If a person told you they were being stalked by giant invisible pumpkins which were controlling your mind you would think they were insane (and rightly so).  Well, that belief has every bit as much reason and evidence behind it as does belief in any of the myriad gods humanity has invented.</p>

<p>Does that count Catholics, lol?  This isn&#39;t an argument about whether homosexuality is socially harmful (I don&#39;t really think so, but I can understand the arguments to the contrary), but about whether it&#39;s psychitic.  Psychosis means a disconnect between a persons beliefs or perceptions and the actual state of the real world.  I don&#39;t really see that in homosexuality.  Transgenderism, on the other hand, is clear cut psychosis.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I believe in Intelligent Creation. Nothing more, nothing less. Could be one, could be many. I&#39;m not religious, I&#39;m spiritual, and I truly do not know what the hell is going on in this realm (nor do I claim to -  I have opinions, though). We are creators for the Creator(s) created us, imo. My Spirit Being chose to be here, <em>for a reason.</em>  </p>

<p>As for Homosexuals? I honestly could not care what two consenting adults do. That said, it&#39;s not normal, and in my opinion (and in the opinions of others - based on reality/biology), it&#39;s a mental illness/disorder/perversion - all one in the same, really.</p>

<p>It is a slippery slope, because many Homosexuals <strong>are victims</strong> of sexual abuse, who continue the cycle. Bestiality, and pedos, are most certainly in the same category, imo. It&#39;s just a bit lighter for the former (ie. Aspergers compared to full on psychosis).</p>

<p>Should they be persecuted? No. They need help. What&#39;s the help? I have no idea, maybe we should actually look into it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I hadn’t considered the abuse angle, and it makes sense.  Sometimes to defeat a monster, even inside you, it becomes necessary to become the monster.  I make that assessment only on my own experiences, and admit they have nothing to do with sex, but on some level I think I can understand.  The problem is...ok in my opinion, there is no real help for the individual, no changing them, only the future.</p>

<p>Once a child is exposed to something like that it’s done, like an imprint in wet concrete.  We can help prevent the further abuse, educate, and bring awareness, but that’s all.  You can’t remold concrete after it’s set in adulthood, so to speak.</p>

<p>This is tough.  I know gay people, and they are excellent people.  They deserve a place of respect if they treat me the same way, and so far most of them have.  I don’t have all the answers either.</p>

<p>You keep saying this and it&#39;s so wrong. Religion absolutely is based concretely in reality. It is social by nature, and people are able to forego evidence in favor of the confirmation of their peers. As long as one person can lie with conviction then the rest can believe with conviction.</p>

<p>Believing in God is not a psychosis in that sense at all, it&#39;s inarguable. What you&#39;re saying is totally absurd, you&#39;re just messing with definitions to get your point across.</p>

<p>Yes it does, it absolutely does. It absolutely makes that belief NOT arbitrary. </p>

<p>Your whole argument that religion is a psychosis stems from the idea that the belief has manifested irrationally or abritrarily but here you can see that it&#39;s clearly not arbitrary. There is a social function to believing in God for many people. For many people, <em>not</em> believing in God would he irrational as it would lead to their ostracization.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Saying things over doesn&#39;t make them more true</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You&#39;re right, like you saying religious belief is irrational over and over doesn&#39;t make it more true. What I&#39;m saying is already true, if belief in a religion serves to benefit you socially then participation is a rational choice. If a believe has a verifiable and concrete source, it is not abitrary it did not just pop into someone&#39;s head. It&#39;s an idea that came from peers, most likely peers they respected. No sane person with a working understand of these concepts could honestly call organized religion a psychosis.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If you think god exists please provide evidence.  You can&#39;t though, can you?  There is every bit as much evidence for the existence of God as for the tooth fairy:  none whatsoever.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>How on Earth does your pee brain consider this a valid line of reasoning? We are not discussing whether or not God exists and to do so is pointless. I can just as easily say there is no evidence whatsoever that God doesn&#39;t exist (because there isn&#39;t, it&#39;s not &quot;provable&quot; in any sense) and therefore God exists. Both that and the inverse are totally vacuous statements and besides that they are besides the point.</p>

<p>No evidence for the existence of God does not mean believing in God is a mental illness.</p>

<p>You said believing in God is psyschosis because it&#39;s irrational and arbitrary. I&#39;m saying that religion is an extremely common social institution that many people choose to participate in for social benefit / to maintain status quo, and that the source of that information (the modern religious institution) is not arbitrary.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve laid these points out several times and it seems your only counter is willful ignorance or saying God doesn&#39;t exist, both of which are inappropriate. I&#39;m done with this conversation now unless you want to formulate a real argument for why engaging in group behavior with peers is suddenly irrational because you said so.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hardly. I don’t care to sort through the minutia of why you choose not to believe in anything more than what scientific theory allows for. But the profound contradiction in your statement ‘If you as a human are capable of creativity and complex intelligence, there’s no sensible reason to chalk that up to intelligent design.’ tells me that common sense in this discussion is lost. I’ll stick with my antiquated notion of creative=created.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Look dude, I don’t want to be an asshole or come off like I know everything. Sorry if I’ve made that impression. I just believe that intelligence is required for intelligent production, whether in origin theory or everyday life. It’s clear we don’t see things the same way, but I don’t think you’re an idiot for choosing to believe differently. I’d ask that you extend me the same deference. </p>

<p>We are both members of this sub, which means we rightly question things others take for granted. I automatically respect you for that (haven’t looked at your Reddit history, don’t care about that stuff). Can we agree that rational people can be on both sides of this issue?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t know you as a person and wouldn&#39;t assume i can judge you as such. This argument you have is an awful one and you&#39;ve so far propped it up by insulting me, insulting my intelligence, and attempting to prop yourself up as the moral superior. Meanwhile, you completely ignored any of my questions as to why is the human race so hereditarily (is that a word?) fucked up if we were intelligently created. None of this conversation has been rational from your end. It&#39;s repeated over and over though by many people smarter than us because it&#39;s an irrational belief based on old books from a time when people were on average irrational and terrified and working more from instinct. I still stand by my statement that I&#39;m a cunt. I don&#39;t think either of us deserve a pat on the back for being subscribed to a specific sub.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The sub description’s first line says that we respect all religious beliefs, and I’ve learned now that is not the case. I wasn’t insulting your intellect, and you aren’t a victim. Attempted to throw out an olive branch, and you rejected it. I haven’t yet heard a good reason to believe that intelligence is an unguided accident. You’re chasing me down over what you see as a fallacious argument, but I will stand by the common sense notion that all creative processes require a creative force. It’s okay than you don’t agree. Seriously. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s still unclear to me why you brought the sub in this.</p>

<p>It is however clear that your olive branch doesn&#39;t even extend enough to quit making assumptions about me or what i feel or think.</p>

<p>i don&#39;t have to make a good argument for not believing what hasn&#39;t been proven. You keep wanting me to be in a box and bringing up what you assume must be the counter argument when all i ask is you to defend your own argument with more than blind belief. This isn&#39;t a discussion about what belief is right, I&#39;m not touting a counter argument, you stated a belief - we must have been created to be creative. I asked you - then why all the suffering. Your response is that I&#39;m supposed to argue an opposing belief and i haven&#39;t provided a good argument against your belief. It&#39;s your soap box and you just keep spending it taking about me.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I’m at work, but it seems like you just want to argue. Is what’s being asserted not clear? Im not aware of anything complex (indicative of intelligence) that can be observed materializing on its own. A child can’t be formed without existing human actions, nor can a computer or desk or anything else. The starting point is that human activity and creativity reveals itself in the things we produce/replicate. Both living and inert. Scientists make a machine to detect what they hope will prove that no intelligence was needed to generate. Is that not ironic? If your baseline is that no creative force is required to make things, I’d be curious to hear your rationale. It’s one way or the other. </p>

<p>There are no laws on the books against religious people.  Religious people aren’t denied rights that non-religious people have.  People aren’t physically assaulted or murdered in America because they’re religious.  Religious people still make up about 75% of the country. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>One look at the upvotes (50%) and the comments is enough to make me accept that OP might be right. </p>

<p>Take a look around you. What&#39;s the new dominant social force? Which way are the winds of change blowing?</p>

<p>The politically correct people talk about tolerance. But what&#39;s really going on is a promotion of a new set of values, and repression/intolerance for the older set of values.</p>

<p>Old value set = Christian, heterosexual, white.</p>

<p>New value set = Anything but Christian, everything but hetero, anyone except white.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t think it&#39;s a deliberate plan against people who are white/christian/hetero. It&#39;s more a form of ineptness on the part of the PC&#39;s and SJW&#39;s. They want to bring about change, but they just don&#39;t know how to do that in a civilized way.</p>

<p>So they push for tolerance and rights by doing the same old thing that people have been doing for thousands of years. Instead of making all people equal and accepted, they&#39;re replacing one group of favorites with another.</p>

<p>How is believing in a religion a mental disorder, but, believing you are attracted to the same sex, not? Believing in the latter, goes against biology/reality (dicks and vaginas go together to create new humans), whereas the former... does not. Furthermore, there are far more cases of sexual abuse from Homosexuals, than there are for religious people. How many Homosexuals were abused by male figures in their lives? The numbers are through the roof. Right there, shows sexual trauma/damage to the brain (ie. mental disorder). </p>

<p>But powerful people exploiting common delusions to control the herd doesn&#39;t make those delusions less delusional.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes it does, it absolutely does. It absolutely makes that belief NOT arbitrary. </p>

<p>Your whole argument that religion is a psychosis stems from the idea that the belief has manifested irrationally or abritrarily but here you can see that it&#39;s clearly not arbitrary. There is a social function to believing in God for many people. For many people, <em>not</em> believing in God would he irrational as it would lead to their ostracization.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Saying things over doesn&#39;t make them more true</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You&#39;re right, like you saying religious belief is irrational over and over doesn&#39;t make it more true. What I&#39;m saying is already true, if belief in a religion serves to benefit you socially then participation is a rational choice. If a believe has a verifiable and concrete source, it is not abitrary it did not just pop into someone&#39;s head. It&#39;s an idea that came from peers, most likely peers they respected. No sane person with a working understand of these concepts could honestly call organized religion a psychosis.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If you think god exists please provide evidence.  You can&#39;t though, can you?  There is every bit as much evidence for the existence of God as for the tooth fairy:  none whatsoever.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>How on Earth does your pee brain consider this a valid line of reasoning? We are not discussing whether or not God exists and to do so is pointless. I can just as easily say there is no evidence whatsoever that God doesn&#39;t exist (because there isn&#39;t, it&#39;s not &quot;provable&quot; in any sense) and therefore God exists. Both that and the inverse are totally vacuous statements and besides that they are besides the point.</p>

<p>No evidence for the existence of God does not mean believing in God is a mental illness.</p>

<p>You said believing in God is psyschosis because it&#39;s irrational and arbitrary. I&#39;m saying that religion is an extremely common social institution that many people choose to participate in for social benefit / to maintain status quo, and that the source of that information (the modern religious institution) is not arbitrary.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve laid these points out several times and it seems your only counter is willful ignorance or saying God doesn&#39;t exist, both of which are inappropriate. I&#39;m done with this conversation now unless you want to formulate a real argument for why engaging in group behavior with peers is suddenly irrational because you said so.</p>
