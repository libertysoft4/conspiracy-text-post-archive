        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>There are a lot of knowledgeable souls in this sub in regards to ancient history, and vatican history. I am curious about your guys opinions into Pope Francis.</p>

<p>Does he signify the end of Rome? There are so many scriptures/prophecies and manuscripts detailing a last pope and the times we are in currently. I really truly feel we are at a cross roads as a species, about to make the harvest into a higher dimension of consciousness. (Look into the Law of One if you are curious, it is amazing stuff)</p>

<p>I want to hear your guys opinions. Feel free to share links or articles. I am doing research on this right now and trying to connect a few puzzles and could use your guys opinions on Pope Francis occupying the throne. Also, I have always been pretty disturbed by the symbolism within the Vatican itself... That deserves a whole different topic but I am convinced that the luciferians got a pope into the vatican. Let me know what you think.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, not everyone is on the same page and I was hoping this would spark some discussion and maybe help people get up to speed or atleast researching this</p>

<p>I have not done much study into christian theology as you can probably tell I just know the basics and was hoping someone more informed may discuss the matter with their own expertise and experience.</p>

<p>I totally forgot about that sub, i appreciate the reminder. Going to browse through now :) In regards to the power preists hold, its pretty ridiculous, it also pisses me off how molestor preists get shuffled around and never face justice. Seems pope francis could do something but hasnt yet (as far as im aware)</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>When Jesus came to the region of Caesarea Philippi, he asked his disciples, “Who do people say the Son of Man is?”  They replied, “Some say John the Baptist; others say Elijah; and still others, Jeremiah or one of the prophets.” “But what about you?” he asked. “Who do you say I am?”  Simon Peter answered, “You are the Messiah, the Son of the living God.”</p>

<p>Jesus replied, “Blessed are you, Simon son of Jonah, for this was not revealed to you by flesh and blood, but by my Father in heaven. And I tell you that you are Peter, and on this rock I will build my church, and the gates of Hades will not overcome it. I will give you the keys of the kingdom of heaven; whatever you bind on earth will be bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth will be loosed in heaven.”  </p>

<p>I don&#39;t know if Jesus would believe a pope should exist, but that&#39;s the biblical underpinnings for the existence of a pope.</p>
