<p>#WalkAway reaction in a nutshell</p>

<p>Basically, some democrats have used the hashtag, circulated a video of some guy who was saying why he was leaving the democrats etc etc</p>

<p>The response was to call them all bots regardless of whether or not the campaign was grassroots or not, a couple &quot;russian linked&quot; accounts was enough to run articles calling it a russian op</p>

<p>If I was one of the people walking away, this kind of doubling down and alienating of a position would just make me run</p>

<p>Now I know that signs denying liberals don&#39;t want to believe in it. But the study for those that didn&#39;t read it.

<p>The only thing different was Trump was played by a woman and Hillary was played by a man. And the liberal audience ended up preferring the female version of trump to the male version of Hillary Hillary</p>

<p>I&#39;m a right leaning libertarian, independent as well as someone who is still researching things like Nationalist-Socialism and other forms of Politics. I want a major 3rd party which is on even keel with the other 2</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Would you like to explain what used to make you a &quot;democrat.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yeah, I was born and raised in a major city and this is just what you always were, and the GOP were always the bad guys. Dems were always for human rights, equality, etc. However, I watched nothing change in my city under democrats, and watched my city fail with budgeting, having to take out loans to pay the pensions, sell out their Parking meters to Saudi Arabia (selling out local infrastructure to foreign powers) and not do anything about the struggling neighborhoods and high crime rates, and this Democratically controlled city now has the highest number of people moving out in the entire country.</p>

<p>In fact, there is a major exodus of people moving out from Democratic Cities/States because Democrats always fuck up everything thy are in charge of:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/patrickgleason/2017/12/23/mass-exodus-from-states-run-by-democratic-machines-continues/">https://www.forbes.com/sites/patrickgleason/2017/12/23/mass-exodus-from-states-run-by-democratic-machines-continues/</a></p>

<p>And because of the Exodus, they will have to raise Taxes on everyone who stays, and I am already living in a state with the 2nd highest real estate tax rates in the country, plus they are talking about raising them more.</p>

<p>Hillary was the nail in the coffin for me to leave, and now just hearing Maxine Waters talk, Diane Feinstein, Chuck Schumer, Nancy Pelosi, etc just hearing them talk, and the victimization mentality of Democrats where everything is always complaining, always a victim, always negative, and now attacking GOP cabinet members at restaurants, Antifa, wanting wide open borders, and so on....its all over for them. I will never ever go back and many people are waking up to this and leaving</p>

<p>Later I became a truther, wheh I started doing research and found the his yearbook said he was born in Kenya, and that he was funded by Saudi Arabia and was an agent of theirs:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.westernjournal.com/harvard-law-review-bio-obama-born-kenya/">https://www.westernjournal.com/harvard-law-review-bio-obama-born-kenya/</a></p>

<p>But in my own home city, the democrats are corrupt, get busted for corruption, some are in jail for bribes, scams, kickbacks, the crime keeps going up, the taxes keep going up, everyone who is close to retiring leaves because its unaffordable, now many are pro communism, they want the borders wide open and other ridiculous policies.</p>

<p>WTF? No man...I was proud to be a democrat and read many books on democratic policies at the time. WTF are you talking about peer pressure?</p>

How many times have people had to stop down in the last few years from the upper echelons?  At least 6 people that I can think of.  Did you read any wikileaks?  You are disgusting.  The left doesn&#39;t even have a problem with war.  Stop witch hunting people that used to share your fucked up values and accept that the party is corrupt.

If you want to insist that the DNC is the bigger issue you can&#39;t ignore the blatant corruption right in front of you.

<p>What will ignoring what he&#39;s doing now do for us? If the platform of Bernie Sanders is important to you then how can you possibly ignore the damage that Trump represents?</p>

<p>That doesn&#39;t mean ignoring the problems of the DNC, but to address it as the primary problem won&#39;t help things. I&#39;m not going to cede the country to Republicans for another term just to get back at my own party.</p>

The fact that they allow for Trump to run amok only makes them complicit in the harm he does, they don&#39;t get a pass because of their inability to do anything about him.

<p>hello fellow democrat!</p>

<p>do you honestly think lobbyists weren&#39;t running every sector of government prior to Trump?</p>

<p>No. Know how I know? the current lobbyists running the EPA are undoing everything done before :) Turns out the energy companies dont want restrictions on things like the &quot;environment&quot; because it hurts profit. I don&#39;t really want the EPA to be worried about the viability of coal going forward. I&#39;m kind of a traditionalist, I like the EPA looking out for the environment. </p>

<p>The candidate they hated still won their primary.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I don&#39;t like Clinton, but I don&#39;t hate her either. My support for Sanders didn&#39;t put me in direct opposition to everything Clinton stood for, I just don&#39;t agree with her on everything. They still put forth a more agreeable candidate than Trump would ever be.</p>

<p>And I&#39;ll say this as a Sanders supporter, he had an uphill climb in 2016 no matter what help the DNC provided Clinton. The system inherently favored her from the start, and Sanders being a relative unknown in the party meant starting from nothing. He did an outstanding job with it, but I can&#39;t pretend that the DNC gave the South to Clinton; she was far better known there than Sanders could ever hope to be. They also got to vote first, so despite the South being utterly useless to us in the general, they still had an outsized influence in the primary.</p>

<p>It&#39;s a system in need of a fix, but it doesn&#39;t put me more opposed to their choice than Trump.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>There&#39;s that hyperbole i suggested you avoid.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="https://www.aclu.org/blog/free-speech/freedom-press/trump-once-again-threatens-change-federal-libel-laws-dont-exist">That&#39;s not hyperbole</a>. Trump has long been an advocate of libel laws that prevent people from being able to criticise him.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The free market will respond.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There is no free market for internet service. Most operate as de facto monopolies with incredible hurdles (and occasionally outright laws) that prevent competition. There&#39;s a reason why we don&#39;t just have private roads everywhere, there&#39;s a limit to how much infrastructure is practical, so centralization of key components like roads and internet connectivity are inevitable.</p>

<p>You cannot tell me as a proponent of free speech that you agree with being limited to internet access that only aligns with say, Comcast (or whichever of the big three happens to dominate your market, and if it&#39;s not the case, then congrats, because it was in everywhere I&#39;ve ever lived in the country), finds acceptable.</p>

<p>There is an argument with television, because the bandwidth to provide channels is limited, but it doesn&#39;t work the same for internet access, where your bandwidth goes has no effect on Comcast&#39;s ability to provide you with unhindered access to it.</p>

<p>I&#39;m sure you&#39;ve seen pictures like <a href="https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/58f637cdf40dae9a008b5211-960-480.jpg">this</a> before, but we&#39;ve already seen it come to pass, Portuguese internet access already makes winners and losers out of those the ISPs choose to do business with, and users just have to deal with it.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You have your most senior leaders calling for harassment of Trump officials and supporters.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Nothing entitles a member of the government freedom from being criticised in person. Threats are unacceptable. Violence is unacceptable, but your actions as a member of the government doesn&#39;t mean you get a shield from your conduct being criticised.</p>

<p>I&#39;m sure we could create more 1st amendment zones or keep to writing letters to individuals who&#39;ll never see them, but merely talking to them is free speech and I don&#39;t see the problem in encouraging it.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Both fucking suck. Can we at least agree on that?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>They don&#39;t EQUALLY suck, which is a very important distinction. I&#39;m all for change within the DNC. They&#39;re far too fixated on internal bureaucratic nonsense for their own good, there&#39;s still a hierarchy of sucking that doesn&#39;t look too favorably on their opposite number.</p>

<p>Our elections are in a first past the post system. We can and should address the deficiencies of the party, but that doesn&#39;t mean surrendering our future to the Republicans. We can do better than that.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Christ dude, you&#39;ve got me. His criticism of the Democrats totally aligns him more with Donald Trump now.</p>

<p>But seriously, it&#39;s one of the biggest problems of the Republican party that it demands fealty to the party even when someone like Trump wrecks it from within. </p>

<p>A bunch of cowards represent the GOP establishment who are too scared to risk upsetting their core base (which continues to shrink as fewer Americans choose to call themselves Republicans) by addressing the problem that is Trump.</p>

<p>Sanders criticism of the DNC is valid. The party should not shy from criticism and it&#39;s one of the things that aggrivates me about Clinton supporters in that they refuse to accept any failures of her or her campaign or the idea that Sanders might have a point in the failings of the DNC. But that doesn&#39;t put Trump anywhere near aligning with Sanders just because they both took issue with the TPP.</p>

<p>Trump is in Brussels today attempting to dismantle NATO from inside, seemingly for no gain but to promote his relationship with Putin (a country with a GDP lower than Italy.) He&#39;s spurned our relationship with our closest neighbors, our most dedicated allies, ripped up deals and offered nothing in their wake. And you want to pretend that makes Sanders more in line with Trump than Clinton? Talk about drivel...</p>

<p>Okay, let&#39;s say that the UK was a superpower and the US wasn&#39;t, but it had the same corrupt government it has now.

    <div class="md"><p>The talking point on reddit to marginalize the movement has been to point to that sub and their mods as proof the whole thing is a psyop… Which is disingenuous honestly.  #walkaway has been all over the news for the past 2 weeks, and the take over of that sub was 5 days ago.  So sure, Trump supports may have taken over that sub, but to act like the entire movement coming from Russia or T_D is kind pathetic.  It&#39;s is possible to realize the DNC isn&#39;t offering anything besides &quot;we&#39;re not trump&quot; and have been center right for years.  I&#39;m always surprised when I hear someone claim to be a liberal or progressive but supports the DNC... The same way I&#39;m surprised by people who claim to be libertarian and support the RNC.  These parties don&#39;t represent ether party and are bought and paid for.</p>

<p>If you walk away from the Democrat Party generally become more conservative</p>

<p>And considering the left will even call Sanders a right-winger for not supporting the abolition of ice we can&#39;t really take them seriously.</p>

<p>To be considered left by the Democrat party&#39;s main extremists you have to participate in a constant competition of who can be further left left</p>

<p>What do you mean by culture? Can this term really be applied to an overweight, overmedicated, and overindebted carceral, welfare/warfare slave society? </p>

<p>Or perhaps the culture whereby men can amputate their testicles and become women, where men can get pregnant and give birth, and where the lower intestine is confused for a sexual organ?</p>

<p>The point I&#39;m trying to make is that culture (civilization, truth), has started being systematically destroyed in the USA a long time ago already. The process is almost complete. It is sad really, as the US is indeed the only nation ever founded on the natural principle of individual liberty.</p>

<p>Oh, and the destroyers aren&#39;t best described as <em>Russian</em>.</p>
