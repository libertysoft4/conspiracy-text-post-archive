    <div class="md"><p>The only other explanation I have is a pollutant or maybe even radiation. But it’s pretty almost completely consistent to scabies. They are itching their legs and wrists and between their fingers. Some people are itching so bad if you look at their hands they have sores. </p>

<p>Moreover I assure you people are being infected with, diagnosed (and treated) for scabies every day-- that would be impossible in the scenario you&#39;re describing. Also there has been extensive <a href="https://www.daytondailynews.com/business/scabies-outbreak-reported-kettering-hospital/qaMrjEgK0AzE6EvHBzUlHL/amp.html">reportage</a> on recent scabies <a href="http://www.foxnews.com/health/2018/04/27/former-model-eaten-alive-while-in-care-georgia-nursing-home.html">outbreaks</a>  . . . in the scenario you&#39;re describing, not possible.

    <div class="md"><p>For bed bugs, roaches, etc, use boric acid [drug store] on the carpets, crevices, mattress, counters, etc. Also diatomaceous earth, it is a natural product and can be purchased in pool supply stores since it is used in pool filters. Both are inexpensive white powders. </p>

<p>Don&#39;t breath the DE. It is the skeletons of single celled algae and formed from silica. You don&#39;t want that stuff in you lungs. Like boric acid it does a number on the exoskeletons of insects and spiders and is mostly non-toxic to mammals. Sulfur powder is also effective, but it can be explosive, allergic, and it is highly toxic to fish and aquatic life. </p>

<p>An effective scabies control paste can be made out of vaseline and powdered sulfur [garden section, fertilizer], but vaseline all by itself only makes the scabies mites spread. Do NOT get either in the eyes. For that area use a greasy make-up type concealer and/or a sticky, shiny lipstick. Scabies REALLY don&#39;t like lipstick. I don&#39;t know why but it kills them better than just about anything. </p>

<p>Also to control scabies you have to bathe Every Single Day, no exceptions, and use clean towels. And change your bedding and your clothes daily. </p>

<p>Or you can sleep in a bed dosed with powdered sulfur, which is possible unless you get it in your eyes. Then it isn&#39;t. Sulfur is VERY irritating. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I read that they have a synthetic diatomaceous earth called Cimexa that works better. I have a room mate that works for the airlines and he brought home a little present a while back. Had to throw out my bed and sofa. Now I have the legs of my new bed inside little plastic cups with a bunch of Cimexa in it after having the exterminator come out to treat the apt. Now I itch all the time but I am pretty sure it is just my anxiety disorder getting the best of me. When we had the bugs I had bites and a really bad allergic reaction rash. I guess we got lucky and caught it early. The bug guy sprayed once, came back and sprayed again after two weeks. Two weeks from now he is going to come back and place traps to detect them to make sure they are all gone. </p>

<p>Needless to say we now have strict decon procedures for when that room mate returns from a trip!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>In the good old days, when people
smoked cigarettes and pipes everywhere,
you never heard about scabies epidemics
or bedbug infestations.</p>

under control.</p>

prevalent in countries with low rates
of tobacco consumption.</p>
