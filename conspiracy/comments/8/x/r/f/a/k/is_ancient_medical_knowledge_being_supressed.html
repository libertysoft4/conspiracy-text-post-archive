<p>This video demonstrates mantra as a cure for an individual&#39;s cancer.</p>

<p>I have formally learned a technique of hands-on healing, where use of energy or intention interacts with the body of the client.</p>

<p>Is it possible that medical giant corporations manipulate study and public opinion to shake people&#39;s belief in internal healing methods?</p>

<p>People are rediscovering more and more, this Shamanic technology as a path for healing and spiritual growth, and it is widely used and recognized in many other countries.</p>

<p>Perhaps this country&#39;s cult of material science has led us astray for their own benefit.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The so called &quot;laws of physics&quot; are nothing more than the simplified conclusions man arrived at from a severely limited perspective and understanding.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No. I am quick to judge because he has literally no facts to his claims. No one could ever reproduce his claims and his “facts” literally don’t make sense. This isn’t a “well, maybe we just don’t understand yet” case. The dude was a huckster who died without one single of his claims ever been proven true, and the same for after his death. </p>

<p>Human knowledge may be “infinitesimal” as you say, but when scientific claims can not be proven by peer-reviewed science it’s time to stop giving it the time of day. </p>

<p>And if the laws of physics are “noting more than simplified conclusions” then his claims didn’t meet any of the currently accepted conclusions. WHICH IS EXACTLY WHAT SCIENCE IS! </p>

<p>Scientific method isn’t set in stone, it’s a constant updating of process and new knowledge and fucking quack ideas like this don’t stand up to old, or new ideas. </p>

<p>And, when your loved one is during of cancer in front of you, let’s see where you go for treatment. The the large pile of false scientific healing machines or the actual science and medicine of a hospital...</p>

That seems to have forgotten that ALL of us are tiny simplistic (incredibly fucking complex at the same time) specks that exist for an incredibly short amount of time for some fucking reason none of us have figured out. I&#39;m 98% sure that in 100 years the school of physics will have changed completely. From what I&#39;ve seen of existence from my two eyes, the weirder the theory the more likely it&#39;s true. This existence is so freaking weird, you just have to start looking outside of society to see that. </p>

And are you the mighty decider of reality, Friend?</p>

<p>Don&#39;t put it in me to defend or explain for televised millionares using christian charlatains. If you made me, I would ask you, are you certain those healers believe in what they are doing?
More importantly, no honest medical practice claims 100 percent success.
It barely happens, but sometimes ordinary routine proceedures like wisdom teeth extractions, a surgeon will damage the vital artery that supplies your gums, resulting in a critical injury maybe death.
Nothing will work with certainty and I dont have all the answers.
I heard the stats overall from my teacher, so I have no stats,
But the generalized stats for major operations are slightly less successful than placebo, while tracked pranic therapy has been slightly more effective than placebo. Its hard to make generalizations in this field because each body and illness is so unique and varied, and this world so immense it seems just at least one case of just everything is bound to happen somewhere.
People are rarely but still sometimes born without skin.
Nobody deserves that fate but it happens. Neither my &quot;magik&quot; nor surgery is going to save them. But both approaches have proven effective in their own right.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Try not to coubt your chickens it&#39;s not so simple.
See what if there has been such study and science done even by our own scientists.
Well legally they only have to release the results of the study they like.
Do 1000 trials?
800 of them don&#39;t go your way, throw them out, never happened the 200 times the results point to your conclusion?
&quot;A new study was published and over 200 participants experienced ect.&quot;
Never mentioning how many times they ran the test all together.
I just mean to illustrate how if our sciencers and doctorfolk don&#39;t believe in their results, we will simply never see them.</p>

<p>Also.
The process requires belief as a fundamental element. This means it isnt so easy to accomplish, you need multiple trained practitioners plus a client who wants their healing in this mode,  all in a society full of judgemental apes who will literally call you crazy for simply acknowleging how amazing and magical our bodies really are.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Wouldn&#39;t know off the top of my head a particular example. But you may also want to take into account that actual medications are also subject to the placebo effect. Not advocating for no medication, just that we seem to be ignoring a powerful tool simply because pharmaceutical companies love to dose people up and rake in the money.</p>

<p>The fact that an increasing number of medications are unable to beat sugar pills has thrown the industry into crisis. The stakes could hardly be higher. In today&#39;s economy, the fate of a long-established company can hang on the outcome of a handful of tests.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, the placebo effect gets a bad rap, but the mind is hugely important for healing. Especially for things like pain</p>

<p>I dont believe in new age treatment for cancer itself, but Im sure it helps with all the side effects</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I dont mean to disrespect any healing mode.
I just prefer my mode, which uses raw feeling, the data of emotion. Science and medicine in the weat are not sure what to make of emotions, but I assure you the answer is not to pretend they dont exist or matter. They are a key component of the living experience.
Healing through belief and emotion has fewer adverse health effects than literal radiation and clinicly it&#39;s proven as or more effective.</p>
