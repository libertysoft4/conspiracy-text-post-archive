    <div class="md"><p>Mods, please don&#39;t shoot me.  Yes, I&#39;ve posted this twice, but the other was in a different discussion that seems to not have any traction.  I&#39;ve listened to about half of the press conference, and here&#39;s the stuff I picked up:</p>

<p>The witness, &quot;Luke&quot; (not real name) joins the call at 32 minutes.  Here&#39;s a direct link to the point that he starts: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odeiBxOYKmQ&amp;amp;t=32m0s">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odeiBxOYKmQ&amp;amp;t=32m0s</a></p>

<p>The person interviewing Luke says &quot;no names&quot; (at about the 35:30 moment), so the names of the assailants are not given.</p>

<p>It seems that the two killers (according to the witness) were a DEA agent and a ATF agent.  The witness knows both of them personally, and claims to know them &quot;well&quot;.  I haven&#39;t gotten any more than that from the press conference yet.  </p>

<p>I&#39;m going to listen to at least a little bit more, and if I hear anything more concrete, I&#39;ll update this here.</p>

<p>Around the 38:00 point, he says that there was a third person involved.  That third person was an ex-agent (civilian at the time), and friends with the other 2.</p>

<p>The witness also says that the killers knew that Rich had the thumb drive on him (since he always carried it with him), and they were going to confront him to get it.  He seems to be implying that they may not have intended at first to kill him, I&#39;m not sure though. The killers also apparently changed some of the emails, or wanted to?</p>

<p>At the 41:10 point, the witness is asked if Rod Rosenstein had any connection, or what the connection would be.  The witness said about Rod:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If he was not the person who authorized it, then he was certainly their protection on the other end.  He was their protection for everything.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The witness says that the rumor about MS-13 involvement is completely false.</p>

<p>At 48:15, a reporter from the Daily Beast asks &quot;why should we believe you?&quot;  The witness seems to avoid the question, and just says that &quot;people have taken polygraph tests&quot; and &quot;serial numbers on currency&quot;.  If these relate to the question asked, I don&#39;t understand how.</p>

<p>At 1:14:45 he is asked about this again, and says he was polygraphed by &quot;US Secret Service&quot;.   He&#39;s asked if there is a way to verify this.  He says &quot;I&#39;m sure House Intel has it.  I don&#39;t want to dodge the question, but it is, ... it is available.  They have it.&quot;</p>

<p>At 51:00, Scott from channel 7 asks why a press conference, instead of going to law enforcement.  Someone else steps in and says all this information has been given to authorities.  They are just choosing not to act on it.</p>

<p>52:00: &quot;Have you talked to the DC police?&quot; &quot;No I have not&quot;  He goes on to say that he would not feel safe meeting with them.  He will talk with any serious investigator, if protection can be guaranteed.</p>

<p>56:30: Yahoo news reporter asks how Luke came across all this.  He says that he was &quot;in the core group&quot; with these other guys, and they trusted him.  They were just bragging, and felt safe.  He says of all the other crimes that these guys committed, this was not even the biggest that they had done.  Other stories he knows about them include money laundering, treason, etc.</p>

<p>1:00:15, Luke is asked what he thinks of QAnon.  Luke says that he hasn&#39;t looked into it much, but the little bit that he saw didn&#39;t seem to match up with what he knew.</p>

<p>1:01:45: WashPo reporter wants more information about why we should trust him.  Jack responds more than Luke, and says that this is just the first step in the process.  Because of the dangers involved, more supporting information cannot be given at the time.</p>

<p>1:04:45  He&#39;s asked to re-tell what happened the night again.  Luke says that the following is based on assembling all the things he heard in different retellings of the story:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>There were 3 involved that night.  The, uh, 2 were waiting near his home.  One was following.  They had been watching it all for it all for a week-and-a-half / 2 weeks prior to this.  They had been waiting for hours, so it was getting late, DC wakes up early, they were upset that it had gone so long, they thought it would be some time in the night.  They got the call, he was headed home. They had ...? from ...? to .... The two got up and approached him from behind, did a normal stop, get on your knees, cross your ankles,  hands behind your head.  They wanted to identify him, make sure they had the right person.  One covered from behind, the other approached from the right side.  They had  to get almost even with him because his arms were behind his head.  They got up almost even with him, had his head turned, the looked at him, it was him, they shot him in the ribs, the fellow to the left tried to scramble away, they .. in deference to the family maybe listening, tone it down, but they.... uh ...ridiculed him in a sexual manner about being down on his knees, went forward, they shot him again, I don&#39;t know where that one was, they took the thumb drive, left, the thumb drive went to a computer expert..</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Luke doesn&#39;t know what was on the thumb drive, but the first expert they took it to couldn&#39;t get it open.</p>

<p>1:18:00: You say that you don&#39;t want to identify these people by name, but now your voice is going to be out there.  Aren&#39;t you in more danger?  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Yes, but it has been dangerous all along.  Something has to be done to get house intel going.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What about using a voice scrambler?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Doesn&#39;t matter.</p>
</blockquote>

<hr/>

<p>Some other thoughts I had:</p>

<p>There&#39;s a patreon link pinned to the top of the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odeiBxOYKmQ&amp;amp;feature=youtu.be">youtube video</a>.  I&#39;m concerned that this whole thing is just a way to raise more money for this private investigation.</p>

<p><a href="/r/greatawakening">/r/greatawakening</a> (the QAnon conspiracy subreddit) has <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/greatawakening/comments/8xs3m7/">their own theories going</a>.  They&#39;re pretty leery of all this, but mostly just because Jerome Corsi doesn&#39;t believe the QAnon crap.</p>

<p>People should also keep in mind the likelihood that Three Letter Agencies can intimidate families/witnesses to stick to the &quot;official version.&quot;  Many suspect Lee Harvey Oswald&#39;s widow and his brother were paid off.  Same with Michael Hastings&#39; widow--she ended up at NBC I think (?). </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s some objective reporting there. Jesus. Did anyone tell him that this Burkman guy got shot (and the shooter arrested, so it&#39;s not like he shot himself)? These people might be a little worried for their lives.</p>

<p>How many times are we expected to take &quot;anonymous government source&quot; from CNN and company as credible (when later proven to be wrong), but this guy&#39;s automatically questionable because he&#39;s afraid for his life?</p>

<p>There was mention of &quot;evidence&quot;, did anyone get to that part? It&#39;s an hour and forty minutes. Does he have any physical evidence? Not that being willing to name a couple of agents isn&#39;t enough. (And a third ex-agent of some sort.) Investigations have been started over less.</p>

<p>Just accusing two people is far from enough. Was there any actual evidence presented?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not that I could tell. Just indications of future releases. Which to me doesn&#39;t make an incredible amount of sense. They now know who he is. Or given the description of the group he was part of where this information was shared, it would be easy for them to narrow it down. If it were me, I&#39;d dump anything I had. Have live video of him giving it to WaPo, Daily Beast and Yahoo News reporters so they couldn&#39;t ignore it. Now all they have to do is find him.</p>

<p>I really hope they have good security. If they sent 3 people after a drunk kid, imagine what they&#39;d be willing to do against this guy. Especially since he alluded to other crimes at higher levels, including treason. The guy could even do a live feed on several of the normal channels (FB, youtube and others less major) and name names and show documents.</p>
