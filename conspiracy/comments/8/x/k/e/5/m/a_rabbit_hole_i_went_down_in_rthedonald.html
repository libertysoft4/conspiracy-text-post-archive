I personally don&#39;t understand, and I&#39;m not sure if everyone there are trolls or bots, or actually people who have bought 100% into it. So Really Randomly I click on user/SoapKitty mainly because I like the name. I start to go through the post history when I notice he is the moderator of two subreddits, One called r/HorribleDeplorable, and the other called r/HorribleDeplorables. </p>

<p>Each of these subreddits only has one post, each referencing car insurance. Each of them has two comments, One being a link to <a href="http://insureinfoq.com/index.html?src=reddit2nsurance">http://insureinfoq.com/index.html?src=reddit2nsurance</a> and the other being. Both were posted by users  aleksey854samoylov, and  nikolay283zhuravlyov, both names not hiding a russian tone. </p>

<p>Looking into the link, it looks like your average going to steal all your info ad, and when I google it seems to pop up in a lot of Right Wing Posts.</p>

<p>Any Ideas?</p>

<p>Did you misspeak? T_D user created the subs, <em>and it looks like those bots posted to them</em>. Bots post to random subs all the time, that&#39;s the point of spamming. Throw enough shit everywhere, and hope x amount of it gets through and x amount of people fall for it.</p>

I spoke about how the Tuscon story wasn&#39;t organic in a post a while back. I asked, why would people be pushing a story like that? There was, at best, flimsy evidence that the camp had anything to do with human trafficking but it absolutely exploded online. Why would a story like that blow up so much. That&#39;s when a guy sent me to Hamilton-68. It is a site that tracks Russian bot accounts. For whatever reason, the top things they were pushing online was Tuscon, Human Trafficking, CEMEX. It&#39;s a very interesting site. </p>

I&#39;m pretty left wing, just anti bullshit, and most people here will take your post with no merit as bullshit, especial if it appears you have an agenda. Before the election everything was fine, but around the time people started analysing Clinton emails (not even pizzagate, just her doing a dirty on Bernie, faking &#39;spontaneous&#39; interviews, hoping to vs Trump, missing evidence, trying to rally everybody up into some Russia hate war, funds for shills etc etc) all her followers lost all ability to have any rational conversation and started shilling and brigading insanely hard, and it&#39;s carried on to this day. &quot;Reeeee don&#39;t talk about my clinnnnton&quot;.

As for the bots in those other two subs, they just appear to be standard spam bots that you get in any sub with no moderation or account age rules.

<p>Both guys felt like they were lied to so, so much, that the only logical recourse was to trust only the alt-information circles... Ending up, both of them, with diets of pure, unadulterated shit.</p>

<p>The Q-cult member will lash out, refuse to talk with anyone who seeks to pass doubt on Trump being God-sent to save us from Luciferian pedophiles.</p>

<p>And the flat Earther? Well, he stopped taking my calls, and, the last thing I heard, he&#39;s reading a book that will allow him to jump into parallel dimensions.</p>

of the unsureinfoq.com page which is rather interesting.</p>

<p>My latin sucks but &quot;Ut enim ad minim veniam&quot; stood out to me:</p>

<p>Google Translate doesn&#39;t yield much of a sensible interpretation</p>

<p>And <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Nexperms56121878">another</a></p>

<p>And yet <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Histithad121396">another</a></p>

<p>There seems to be no indication of these being primarily Russian - the accounts above are not Russian names.</p>

<p>After some data mining I found that this website is hosted by The Endurance International Group in Burlington, Massachusetts.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.statshow.com/www/insureinfoq.com">Website Analytics</a> from StatShow.</p>

<p><a href="https://domain-status.com/www/insureinfotech.com">Website Analytics</a> from DomainStatus.</p>

<p>It is a GoDaddy account created on: Tuesday, March 13, 2018</p>

<p>This page receives about 0 - 1 view every day. Quite strange.</p>

<p>So this is another proof that the_Donald is run by Israelis. But we already knew it for a year at least.</p>
