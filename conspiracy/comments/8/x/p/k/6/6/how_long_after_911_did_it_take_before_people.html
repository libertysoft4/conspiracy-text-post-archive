Regardless, to answer OP question; it was within hours where they started planting seeds that this was Bin Laden. I think I remember Bill O&#39;Reilly that very evening pointing fingers towards it as well. It wasn&#39;t so obvious in the moment but looking back it is easy to see that the narrative was laid out way in advance.</p>

<p>Many were primed by previous events to immediately question the official narrative. Just one example of that awareness is that the bombing of the Murrah Building in Oklahoma City in 1995 was extensively analyzed online.</p>

<p>At that time, <a href="https://Rense.com">Rense.com</a> was probably the focal point on most conspiracy theories.</p>

<p>Conspiracy conversations have been going on for 25+ years on the internet. Maybe you weren&#39;t born or maybe you didn&#39;t have internet, but the topic has been discussed in depth. Smart phones/social media have opened some eyes but they also closed many more minds to conspiracies. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I questioned the official narrative immediately. I was in middle school when it happened and we all turned on the TV to watch. Pissed off a lot of people being a smart ass about how that&#39;s not what happens when a building explodes, that it looks like controlled demo. Also, I immediately assumed we (our government) did it or at least had a hand in it. To be fair though, my mom&#39;s favorite movie at the time was The Long Kiss Goodnight that features a DOD faking terrorism for more funding, so the idea that that was within the realm of possibility was already implanted in my mind.</p>

<p>In the first 3 years or so, it was 99% impossible to find any mainstream sources or acknowledgement of 9/11 questions.  There was a blackout enforced on both right-wing &amp; left-wing sources except the regrettable Alex Jones.  Art Bell would hang up on any callers wanting to discuss 9/11.  It was a memorable time because of the totality of the blackout.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, <em>9/11 Timeline</em> was one of the very first &quot;media&quot; sources that was remotely questioning of the official narrative.  I remember that clearly.  As that was slowly filled in, the truth of what happened came into focus.  Before then, you could talk with your friends about how it was obvious nonsense, but there was no verification, no evidence -- not even on the internet.</p>

<p>It wasn&#39;t until <em>years</em> later that I even managed to see the famous clip of WTC 7 collapsing, for instance.  I never saw the massive Iraq war protests.  And it&#39;s not like I was disconnected.  I was on the internet every day.  I had cable television.  It&#39;s like there was a blackout, as you said.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>For me, it was as it was unfolding.</p>

<p>-Lack of air support on the entire Eastern Seaboard.  Absolutely no formal response for hours after the first plane hit.  Air support finally came from Maine, comprised of 2 fighter planes.</p>

<p>-Flight 93 was originally reported shot down</p>

<p>-No video of plane hitting the Pentagon.  The fact the Pentagon even got hit and that there was no air support over the most strategically important military facility in the world despite 2 airfields in a 5 miles radius.  The absence of video evidence from the hundreds of businesses surrounding the Pentagon.</p>

<p>-The reports of insider trading in American Airlines stock.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>As the towers were freefalling into their own footprints, I wondered aloud to my co-workers why they were demolishing the towers.  How do they already know they&#39;re structurally unsound?  They completely agreed.  Watching the live footage, no one thought anything besides it being a clear demolition job.  It took heavy narrative control to make us even begin to doubt our &quot;lying&quot; eyes.</p>

<p>He may have known about this, because his original prediction of the
end of August was the time the government found out about a suspected
plot and had arrested 4 men trying to bomb something I can&#39;t remember
what.  So he seemed to know about the first attempt and then he knew
about this one too.  After something like this and the people in
Afghanistan partying about it no one is going to feel bad about us
wiping them out.  It is a death wish.  Now we have a reason to bomb
Bin Laden and all other terrorist groups and even the Russian
government who are supposedly allies with Afghanistan aren&#39;t going to
lift a finger to help.  Putnam even said the poeple that did this
cannot go unpunished.  So whoever did this just put a target on every
terrorist organization in the worlds back.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is actually a very interesting topic for people who were conscious at the time. So much of the truther movement is based on hindsight and retrospect, and it can be difficult to filter through and seperate how the facts and suspicions evolved over time, versus in real time as they happened. </p>

<p>I remember when it happened. I was 18 at the time. The questions began for me immediately, and they had nothing to do with science or physics, just logistics and basic human nature. The biggest question I had that day was how it was possible that entire planes full of full grown American adults could be held at bay by 3 or 4 5&#39;5&#39;&#39; 130 lb men holding 1-inch boxcutters. A boxcutter doesnt provide any reach. These guys could have easily been pummelled by readily available objects such as carry on luggage.</p>

<p>I remember thinking how sophisticated and highly orchestrated these attacks would have had to have been, and how there were no other coordinated attacks on any of the thousands of US military bases across the world that day.</p>

<p>Also the fact that there were no claims of responsibility at all. If there were some rogue entity that would commit to the funding, time effort, training and resources necessary to pull this off, they would want the world to know they were capable of this. No rogue entity would let such an enormous opportunity go to waste like that. It just defies common sense. Traditionally, terrorist attacks were about leverage and threats. Extremists would take over a plane and start making demands like free our hostages, etc. If any terrorist group flew a plane into a skyscraper in New York, even before the towers fell they could have made serious demands and got just about anything they wanted.</p>

<p>No rogue entity would just do all of this just for the sake of doing it. It just doesnt pass the human nature/greed smell test. I get the whole die for allah martyr narrative, but no one would go through all the steps necessary to pull this off without some benefit or personal gain. You dont bring the greatest superpower the world has ever known to its knees without any follow-up or claim of responsibility.</p>

<p>I remembered how Osama had been all over the news that year, and he was right on the tip of everyones tongue. It just seemed way too convenient and obvious right from the start and I immediately had my suspicions about the idea that Osama did it. If you watch footage from that day you will hear the newscasters mention him as suspect #1. Its hard to see in retrospect, but Osama had been deeply ingrained into the public psyche at the time leading up to the attacks. I remember just waiting for the claim of responsibility, but it never came.</p>

<p>At the time, we were promised the most extensive sophisticated forensic investigation ever done by the FBI. I withheld my judgement waiting for the supposedly massive follow up investigation that never happened. We were supposed to get black box flight recorders and other highly advanced forensics.</p>

<p>I had a cousin in the Airforce at the time, and I remember talking with him before the attacks about how advanced domestic military radar was, how norad worked and how they independently tracked every flight in north america at all times, and how they enforced no fly zones in all the major cities in the US.</p>

<p>Then they release some grainy photos of arabs boarding the planes and this is supposed to serve as proof. Thats all we got. There was no evidence that these guys pictured had anything to do with it, but we had 19 names by 9/12 and we were just supposed to take the governments word. 17 years later this is as much &#39;proof&#39; as we have. At the time it was supposed to a domestic law enforcement operation, not a global war.</p>

<p>Then within 2 months we are conducting a full-scale invasion of Afghanistan with no proof or evidence at all. Being in college, we were asked to do presentations about something relating to the attack, and my paper was about how wrong it was to invade Afghanistan with zero proof, and how this was just blindly lashing out for the sake of lashing out. A lot of people in the class actually agreed with me and I got an A.</p>

<p>Then the Patriot act and sweeping reforms came and i remember thinking how can we address this without knowing who is responsible.</p>

<p>I dont remember any &#39;a-ha&#39; moment. For me it was just having so many un-answered questions, seeing how the investigations we were promised never happened, the invasions, and how the government used this as a tool to do whatever the fuck they wanted at the time. I had seen many controlled demolitions of buildings, and for me there just too many similarities between those and the towers falling. I really expected the initial investigations to reveal bombs in the buildings, because I had remembered the 93 WTC bombing.</p>

<p>By about 2003 I felt beyond any real doubt that it was the US government. I remember going to NY that year and seeing the site, and being afraid to even have that knowledge in my mind. It was a very eerie feeling. There is just no other entity on the globe that had the capability to pull this off. I reached this conclusion on my own before seeing any loose change documentaries or discussions on the web. By the time these came to my knowledge about 2006, it just reinforced my suspicions.</p>

<p>In the beginning, I tried to persuade people, but I eventually just came to the conclusion that people intelligent enough would figure it out on their own. After a while, I never really brought it up or discussed it. I never talked to my parents about it. I did talk about to some of my more trusted friends during late night conversations. Some agreed, some seemed unsure, and others thought I was flat out crazy.</p>

<p>I just remember being so terribly disappointed in my country and the people around me, especially the folks older than me, being so gullible and falling for all the hysteria so easily. At our local army recruiting office, people were literally flowing out the door lined up around the block. Even before we knew who the enemy was, these kids were like &quot;give me a gun and tell me who to shoot.&quot; It stayed crowded until about &#39;04.</p>

<p>Before the attacks, a lot of people still felt Bush stole the election, and he had about a 35% approval rating. To put that in perspective, even with all the hate and partisanship now, thats lower than Trumps lowest rating so far. It was one of the lowest approval ratings ever recorded for a US president. Within 1 month of the attack, his approval rating was in the 90&#39;s. The propaganda was at a fever pitch and in his 02 state of the union he was using ww2 rhetoric like &#39;axis of evil&#39; and calling out countries by name. It was pretty scary shit, that makes russian bots and silly presidential tweets look very tame by comparison.</p>

<p>There was no such thing as dissent in politics. It was the closest I have ever seen to a 1-party system in the US. There was no democratic opposition whatsoever. It really was absolute unopposed neocon power.</p>

<p>It was a strange time to be alive with the terror alerts, and the anthrax mailings, and people ducktaping their windows to survive bio attacks. It was right after Y2K so the doomsday prepper movement was already going, but this really accelerated the idea of US armageddon. AR&#39;s and ammo were literally flying off the shelves. People were building bunkers. The fear was palpable, and looking back it kind of surprises me that the intense paranoia and mass arming didnt lead to more unintended chaotic societal aftershocks and clashes, or perhaps inspire legit terrorist or looters or anarchists to capitalize.</p>

<p>It was a true realignment of global geo-politics. We havent had a legit military threat to the US since the collapse of the soviet union, but the massive expansion of the US military had to be justified, so we now have this new threat of &#39;non-state actors,&#39; a few hundred guys with AK&#39;s that somehow justifies the full-scale invasion and occupation of other countries. People have not only allowed it, they begged for it and the massive military expansion of the past decade and a half will only continue, really all based on this one day.</p>

<p>Everybody thought these attacks would only continue and accelerate. Its just become a passing narrative in the American legacy. It seems the military contractors cashed out, made billions and the objectives were completed. Its just scary to think at any time this can be done again and the government holds this kind of threat over the people to be used at any time they please without most people even knowing.</p>

<p>One thing you have to give them credit for is they exactly how far they can push to achieve their objective without causing complete and utter chaos. THey seem to know right where the line is and can go right up to it without going over it.</p>

<p>It just a sad legacy all the way around and something you just have to try to move on from and forget about hoping it never happens again.</p>
