<p>Wouldn&#39;t even take that anymore. With our reliance on electricity and clean water/processed foods combined with the majority having no survival/agricultural/hunting skills all it would take is an extended power outage.</p>

<p>Even our food supplies are fucked in that case. Cattle etc are packed into yards where they would soon die without constant human intervention and farms rely on irrigation in many areas. Not to mention supply lines grinding to a halt with no means of communication/organization. </p>

<p>Power outage scares me more than most scenerios. People would tear the cities apart within weeks and spread from there.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes it&#39;s being predicatively programmed in movies, TV shows, video games etc.  The media will call it an alien invasion and even walking dead style zombies.  What most people don&#39;t realize is everything that is happening has been already written in the King James Bible.  You even got your elite going underground and into moutains during this time:</p>

<p>Isa 2:19  And they shall go into the holes of the rocks, and into the caves of the earth, for fear of the LORD, and for the glory of his majesty, when he ariseth to shake terribly the earth. </p>

<p>Zec 14:12  And this shall be the plague wherewith the LORD will smite all the people that have fought against Jerusalem; Their flesh shall consume away while they stand upon their feet, and their eyes shall consume away in their holes, and their tongue shall consume away in their mouth. </p>

<p>Zec 14:13  And it shall come to pass in that day, that a great tumult from the LORD shall be among them; and they shall lay hold every one on the hand of his neighbour, and his hand shall rise up against the hand of his neighbour. </p>

<p>Rev 9:3  And there came out of the smoke locusts upon the earth: and unto them was given power, as the scorpions of the earth have power. </p>

<p>Rev 9:4  And it was commanded them that they should not hurt the grass of the earth, neither any green thing, neither any tree; but only those men which have not the seal of God in their foreheads. </p>

<p>Rev 9:5  And to them it was given that they should not kill them, but that they should be tormented five months: and their torment was as the torment of a scorpion, when he striketh a man. </p>

<p>Rev 9:6  And in those days shall men seek death, and shall not find it; and shall desire to die, and death shall flee from them. </p>

<p>Repent and believe this to be saved;</p>

<p>1Co 15:1  Moreover, brethren, I declare unto you the gospel which I preached unto you, which also ye have received, and wherein ye stand; </p>

<p>1Co 15:2  By which also ye are saved, if ye keep in memory what I preached unto you, unless ye have believed in vain. </p>

<p>1Co 15:3  For I delivered unto you first of all that which I also received, how that Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures; </p>

<p>1Co 15:4  And that he was buried, and that he rose again the third day according to the scriptures: </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The catching away (rapture) will be before all the craziness happens.  But yeah, it&#39;s laughable that the elite will think this way:</p>

<p>Rev 6:16  And said to the mountains and rocks, Fall on us, and hide us from the face of him that sitteth on the throne, and from the wrath of the Lamb: 
Rev 6:17  For the great day of his wrath is come; and who shall be able to stand? </p>

<p>Their blood will be up to the horses bridles:</p>

<p>Rev 14:20  And the winepress was trodden without the city, and blood came out of the winepress, even unto the horse bridles, by the space of a thousand and six hundred furlongs.</p>

<p>Everyone likes to only talk about Jesus Christ&#39;s perfect Love and they forgot his perfect wrath!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The Rapture is a pipe dream. In a Shit hits the Fan, no power, no food scenario, the local church congregation will turn into the neighborhood horde going house to house, apartment by apartment taking all food and guns they find, all in the name of god. Any church member that might be a prepper will have all his food, guns and ammo taken immediately.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yep because all of them were unsaved false converts who didn&#39;t get caught away.  Go to a &quot;local Church&quot; and 99% of the time it&#39;s the false converts of Churchanity.  No doubt they will still call themselves Christian and buy into whatever cover TPTB comes up with to explain away the missing people:  Alien abduction?  Bluebeam hoax?  High energy annihilation weapons?  Depopulation agenda?  New Age ascension &quot;event?&quot;  Pick your excuse there will probably be more.</p>

<p>there is absolutely no proof of that.</p>

<p>the ability to medically transition has only existed in the last 100 years. of course it looks like the rate is being pushed higher, because now people can actually transition. and in this society, currently, the rate of transgenderism is still extremely low. </p>

Almost everything else this guy told me has come to pass, but this one, the NK thing, decidedly looks like it will never happen given the recent efforts.  So this leads me to think the timeline has changed, and that pathway is no longer a go.  </p>
