        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I was thinking about this today at work, but all of the people I know who have ended up having drug problems, started using around the age of 16-20. Which is the typical age group that gets their wisdom teeth extracted, when I got my own extracted they weren&#39;t impacted, weren&#39;t infected and we&#39;re causing no issue to me what so ever, yet my dentist still talked me into getting it done for fear that they would become infected. (I&#39;ve had severe TMJ issues for over 10 years now since then but that&#39;s besides the point...)</p>

<p>At the time that I had my operation done I was also at a point in time where I was trying to live and eat clean, so I told the surgeon after that I didn&#39;t need a prescription for any pain meds but he insisted that I should get them anyways incase I needed them later. And he happily handed me a prescription for 90- 20mg oxycodone and told me I could take up to 3 a day if needed. Well, me being a 16 year old stoner at the time, I had plenty of friends who happily bought them from me.</p>

<p>Anyways I was talking to one of my friends who is currently sober, but always falling back to opiates and he told me a very similar story to mine. However instead of being smart enough to just get rid of his, he started crushing and snorting them to get high and when they were gone he found somebody similar to me and bought theirs, and so begun his story of drug use for the last 15 years. He said what was funniest to him, is that he would likely have never even tried oxycodone or hydrocodone if it wasn&#39;t for him getting his wisdom teeth taken out, as he has never had them prescribed to him any other time since then.</p>

<p>So my question to you guys, how likely do you think it is that this is an intentional plot to influence kids when they are at their most vulnerable age to sell more oxycontin and Vicodin? Or do you think it is more of a case of it just happening to be the time that most people experiment with drugs anyways, and doctors/dentists just being basically neglectful?  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was out on some strong meds after an accident 6 years ago. A few weeks in intensive care with the morphine drip then a very long rehab after with strong take home meds. </p>

<p>I heard about Suboxone, which for someone in my situation is both a pain reliever and opioid blocker, meaning even if I did take opioids they wouldn’t work because the receptors in the brain wouldn’t take them. Other than that I had absolutely no side effects, no high, great pain relief. I was able to return to practicing as an attorney and it was great. I would 100 percent recommend it for anyone who has an issue.  </p>

<p>However there was a downside. The brain gets addicted to the suboxone and getting off of it is the same as withdrawing from heroin.  I titrated for a bit but not long enough, and effectively quit cold turkey. I was able to kick it and I’ve never even had an inkling to get more of that or any opioid, but that was a terrible 7 or so days of pure misery.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve watched a few family members try Suboxone to get off of opiates and it&#39;s about the worst thing ever for doing that it seems, as all 3 of them relapsed and then overdosed because they couldn&#39;t get high.</p>

<p>I can see how it would work well in your case though, since it doesn&#39;t sound like you had a mental addiction or any addiction problems beforehand, but in addicts the opioid blocker usually just ends in trying to get high and od&#39;ing  when they can&#39;t.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah I’ve heard that as well. Also heard that it’s getting traction as a street drug as well so maybe it really depends on your status when you start, but I’m convinced that it saved my life. I was able to get a clear head and avoid the huge level of pain while also avoiding the high and other side effects. </p>

<p>At the end of the day though a bad addiction can be almost impossible to overcome. I’m glad I stopped when I did, even though it was hell. Getting through that cold turkey time is harder than I ever expected, but I’m glad to never even want to put myself in a situation to take opioids again. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That sucks. I think Kratom combined with agmatine sulfate and Ultra Low Dose Naltrexone is the way to go if you want to get off opiates. Agmatine and ULDN reduce tolerance and prevent the development of tolerance. Dosages are ~50 mcg or so of ULDN before taking the kratom (yes, that&#39;s micrograms) and 1.5 - 2g per day of agmatine.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I mean tapering is always the best way to get off of opiates, and the substances I mentioned help quite handily with that. The majority of people who try cold turkey aren&#39;t able to quit.</p>

<p>If they relapse after a while and go back to the same doses they used when their tolerance was high, then yeah they can possibly overdose. I&#39;m not too sure how agmatine and ULDN affect the release of beta arrestin (the compound which actually kills you at high doses during an overdose). </p>

<p>Hi. Nice to meet you. Now you have. </p>

<p>Kratom is literally a life saver for people physically addicted to opiates. I have met dozens of people that used kratom to relieve PAWS and eventually stopped doing opiates altogether. I am one of them. </p>

<p>I would never recommend subs or methadone to anyone wanting to actually get clean, the WD is somehow even worse than dope.</p>

<p>Kratom is amazing for this though. I managed to get clean using loperamide but it&#39;s a nasty and unsafe way to do it. But it worked. Even so I wouldn&#39;t advise anyone to use that if Kratom is available.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>So how is switching to a different opiate and taking drugs to lower opiate tolerances going to help that?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It allows a taper, as you mention. But more importantly it allows you to stop the further risks that come with illicit drugs: violence, theft, death, arrest. </p>

<p>You can&#39;t really taper effectively on heroin because there&#39;s no telling what dose you&#39;re getting each time. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>you go cold turkey and just have the shittiest 10 days of your life. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>It isn&#39;t just ten days. Residual impact can last months. </p>

<p>I will call it right now that you&#39;ve never gone cold turkey off a major opiate addiction while options for relief were available. Otherwise you&#39;d realize how asinine you sound. </p>

<p>And it&#39;s not just the physical effects that are a problem. How do you work when you&#39;re going cold turkey? How do you care for your family? You can&#39;t. You can barely drag yourself out of bed or off the bathroom floor. Even if you manage to make it to work it will quickly be obvious to everyone what&#39;s up.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>But I&#39;ve never met an addict that&#39;s ever successfully tapered down or switched to a less potent opiate and  actually quit using.</p>

<p>How do you do. Now you have. </p>

<p>And if you&#39;d actually spent any time with recovering addicts you would know many.</p>

Except cigarettes, can’t seem to kick them.</p>

<p>But the rate the opioids are prescribed pretty much guarantee a new addict is born every few hours I wager.</p>
