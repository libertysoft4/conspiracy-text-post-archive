I&#39;ve never been able to understand 9/11 conspiracies though. It just doesn&#39;t make sense to me that Bush would put his own life, family heritage, government credibility, and the Republican party on the line just to destroy a few papers and invade Iraq. Wouldn&#39;t there be much easier ways to go about invading the middle East than killing 3000 citizens on American soil? Couldn&#39;t they have just faked evidence of the middle east having WMDs? Please help me understand this conspiracy...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>One thing you have to understand, is that the US government got a lot of citizen support for military action after 9/11.</p>

<p>If there hadn’t been an attack on US soil, I doubt many citizens would have supported a war in Afghanistan. This is why W. tried hard to somehow link Iraq to 9/11 (I think he hinted that terrorists would somehow get ahold of Saddam’s WMDs and create an even worse 9/11). </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This makes sense, but it also leads to a new problem. If the U.S. perpetrated 9/11, then why wouldn&#39;t they have immediately blamed it on Iraq? It would&#39;ve made invading a lot easier than trying to connect Iraq to Saddam Hussain...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>He couldn’t have blamed it on Iraq because the 9/11 attackers were actually from Saudi Arabia. It would have made sense to no one. Yet this also raises other questions, like how come we didn’t get particularly angry at SA? Why are we still regional allies? What’s the SA connection? Someone else here also commented on the Saudis. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Bush wasn&#39;t the architect. He was the public face. Plans for 9/11 and the ME were in place long before his election. Who was he the son of? What position did his father hold? What speech was given on Sept 10, 1991? What 10 year loans were issued on Sept 11, 1991? What was the role of the Saudis? Do you know who Bandar Bush is? Those are just a few starting places.</p>

<p>You might want to look into the actual events of the day and the physics of the buildings, but I&#39;ll leave you with this 30 second vide of building 7 collapsing...did you know a 3rd tower fell that day? Hours after WTC 1 and 2? Into its own footprint at free fall?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This entire post is asking for words from people of Reddit. Our dear friend was trying to convey a really important aspect of the 9/11 conspiracies but unfortunately your sarcasm got the better of the conversation. </p>

<p>There are probably two factors that play into these theories; Government motivation and the actual destruction of all (three) buildings. In my opinion, the way the buildings fell, alongside the media’s official narrative of the causes of the buildings falling, are the most notable head-scratchers. </p>

<p>You mean to tell me that three buildings fell straight down the way they did? Two of the buildings had structural damage on one side of them, yet they both fell directly downward. You would think there would have been some leaning over but no, they fell straight down. Many suspect some sort of controlled demolition at play. And the third building, building 7, fell down from a reported fire that weakened some structural beams? Bull. Fucking. Shit. </p>

<p>We are happy to respond and provoke thoughts and provide information for you my man, but sarcasm is nonproductive in this sub, especially if you are the one asking for help in seeking more knowledge. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re right, I got too sarcastic, but I was more looking for motivational purposes behind the 9/11 conspiracy that actually make sense, because without motivational purposes, the entire conspiracy falls apart. Remember, no physical evidence supports the conspiracy, and just because you &quot;dont think&quot; the towers could&#39;ve fallen like that isn&#39;t evidence. But if the towers were rigged with explosives, where was the demo crew? Must&#39;ve been pretty large considering the size of the buildings, how has nothing leaked about them or through them. What would the motivation be for destroying the third building? I&#39;ve heard people thought there were papers in there, but there&#39;s much easier ways to get rid of papers than destroying a building, especially if everyone was distracted by the fact the twin towers were callapsing. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Try looking some of them up.</p>

<p>The point being made, is if the planes hit on one side, why did the buildings no topple over in ANY direction, other than straight down.
If it was so easy, we wouldn&#39;t need demolition experts. Even they can fail to make such a smooth collapse at times.</p>

<p>No other building of this type has EVER collapsed due to being weakened by fire. If we were to believe the official story, than building codes for the whole planet need to be changed. Yet 17 years later, all we get are engineers and architects saying &quot;nope, not possible.&quot;</p>

<p>Then there is the third building that collapsed that day, that was simply hit with some burning debree. Yet another first ever, and yet to be repeated.</p>

<p>There is tons of research on this topic, made by those with a lot more knowledge than myself. But since you cant be bothered to look up definitions  for symmetry(something that mirrors something else) or asysmetry(something that doesn&#39;t). I&#39;m not sure what you&#39;re looking to hear?</p>

<p>Maybe the asbestos in the building that would have cost millions if not billions to replace.</p>

<p>Maybe the guy who just bought the buildings and then received the biggest insurance payout ever.</p>

<p>Maybe the info on trillions of dollars that were held in building 7, and the hearing that involved them the next day. But oops, they&#39;re gone now, no backups.</p>

<p>Maybe the Israeli lobbying constantly for help against it&#39;s neighbors, but without public support, our deepstate (those in government that are there for decades/life) couldn&#39;t help.</p>

<p>tl;dr Somethings have already been researched to incredible depth. Simply search r/conspiracy for 9/11 and go for it. Most of the rest of us here have rehashed all this too many times, but it&#39;s still one of the best red pills to start with.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>South tower did fall at an angle- it&#39;s clearly visible in all of the footage, however we&#39;re talking about 30 stories that fell, 80 stories up in the air. With the loss of support from below, that means the entire portion above impact was in free fall- the top of that section was never going to &quot;catch up&quot; to the bottom and look like a domino falling over. </p>

<p>Of course no building like this has ever collapsed in this manner before, no building that size has ever collapsed period. Skyscrapers over 100 stories tall are extremely modern creations, and even if you DO have some building close to that size which you are using as a comparison, the fact that the towers were hit with 737s, wiping out multiple floors of structural integrity will OBVIOUSLY make a difference in how the building collapses. </p>

<p>Stop lying. The consensus amongst engineers is that the buildings collapsed EXACTLY how one would expect them to. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Really? I believe there&#39;s a University in Alaska that would strongly argue with you. Also the hundreds of engineers signing on, saying that there&#39;s more to this story that we&#39;re not being told. Oh and then the comment from the guy saying to &quot;pull the building&quot;, referring to building 7, which fell moments later, also at freefall speeds, also never happening before. </p>

<p>So what&#39;s your take on a much smaller building collapsing at freefall speeds  for the third time ever. In just a few hours, physics seemed to defy building codes. Yet this never happened before, and no one can state why it would ever happen again. Otherwise building codes would be changed internationally.</p>

<p>But in all, your poor effort in a conspiracy sub, bringing up the same repeated arguments, has you shining out clearly as a shill. You need to try harder to be believable.</p>

Also, don’t look for an answer as to why it happened. Explore the question:”why could this not have happened as the official narrative dictates?”.... look at JFK, it’s hard to say who killed him or why they killed him, but if you focus on all the contradicting evidence, strange coincidences, shady happenings, it becomes clear that the official story is inaccurate</p>

<p>the MSM story is horseshit, and is still attempted to be sold, so USA &quot;free press&quot; is outed as propaganda-against-the people. If you settle on this, you can entertain endless answers to &quot;why&quot; until something makes sense to you.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Im not a huge follower of the theory but from what I have read:</p>

<p>1) SA had an interest in destabilizing the US and ultimately the USD so that the world currency would move to an PetroDollar. Thus a motive to attack the financial sector. </p>

<p>2) US Allowed it to happen as a smokescreen for destroying evidence of debt in WTC7 I believe. Also the owner of the building was in a battle with his insurance company for having the buildings individually insured or having them insured as one location (im not sure how truthful that was and never followed up much on). Another reason it was allowed to happen was the generation of the War On Terror, which led to a 17 year and still going, funding project for the military industrial complex. </p>

<p>3) The US invaded Iraq to secure key pipelines and oil fields to EU/International Ports to hedge the risk of international interest shifting to Petrodollar. This secured supply for the western world when there was a window for SA to try and stake their agenda. Also Iraq had the easiest scapegoat to take down with international support against Saddam. </p>

<p>I was in NY when this happened. I know a bunch of people who died. The planes were real, I do not subscribe to the CGI theory, I think thats BS. Also Bush was played by his intelligence. He was as blind as the US public. </p>

<p>I can say the battle for energy security rages on with Syria right now being a proxy war with Russia over control of oil pipelines that supply Europe. Russia&#39;s annexation of Crimea was for securing the largest port in the black sea, Servastapol, in order to secure shipping route of oil. Low oil prices over the last few years was partly due to SA flooding the market to try and kill off US supply but they underestimated the impact of fracking and horizontal drilling. This has led SA to have a division in the royal family with some wanting to diversify their economy, and the old hats wanting to live off profitable oil to drive growth. This is what caused the arrest last year (an essential coup of the old guard) and why the new young prince has been leading the country to make it more friendly for westerners to come and invest. </p>

<p>Just my $0.02. TLDR: SA committed it, US was complicit. </p>

<p>All those people that are spewing the crazy stuff and presenting different opinions are exactly what someone trying to cover something up would want to happen and would only help encourage the crazy things to make you overlook the conspiracy all together.

    <div class="md"><p>First of all, my account is well over a year old and I just wanted to understand the general consensus of the 9/11 conspiracy. I thought there was a working timeline of what actually happened that was accepted among conspiracy theorists, but everyone just seems to believe something different, which is really dissappinting and discredits the whole conspiracy. I wanted to believe the government perpetrated 9/11, but I&#39;ve seen no hard evidence or logical conclusions as to why they would</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Operation northwoods- our government already planned this “conspiracy” 40 years ago. Staging an attack to gather American support for war. </p></li>
<li><p>Why does America want to go to war in the Middle East? Why was Bush’s father there and why did he end up in the same place 8 years later? Oil. Tons of oil in the Middle East, oil leads to money.</p></li>
<li><p>This interview was in 2004 of general Wesley Clark giving a layout of plans to invade several countries in the Middle East and put powers in place compliant to American views(easy to control).</p></li>
<li><p>When Osama was dead, Husain was dead and no weapons of mass destruction found why were we still in the Middle East invading countries still? (It was all planned just like Wesley Clark stated on interview back in 2004.</p></li>
<li><p>Rumsfeld on 9/10/01(day before 9/11) announced that 2+ trillions of dollars is unaccounted for by the pentagon.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>What happens ? 9/11 happens and coincidentally hit the accounting office of the pentagon. 2 trillions dollars forgotten about.</p>

<p>Every American now wants revenge and everyone is on board to go to war!</p>

<p>War begins, we invade other countries as planned. 17 years later and we are still in the Middle East. </p>

<p>I guess mine was too cluttered. Thought I put it together quite well too.</p>

<p>The sad part is the majority of Americans are like OP. Not aware of 3 towers falling, not aware of all the sketchy situations surrounding 9/11, and how about our government lying and telling people the air is safe around ground zero. Fast forward thousands of deaths due to cancer, and lawsuits galore. </p>

<p>Operation northwoods doesn’t ring a bell for a “reason” for 9/11?
Bush wanted oil, just like his father did 8 years ago, he needed public support and we were all not going to war. America before 9/11, war was not an option, No1 wanted war. 9/11 hits, blame terrorism, guess what we are all shouting for war!!</p>

<p>Same premise operation northwoods had and it was 40+ years ago. This is why conspiracy theorists are good, bc the simple minded human would watch NIST report and accept it, then go watch kardashians.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Try looking some of them up.</p>

<p>The point being made, is if the planes hit on one side, why did the buildings no topple over in ANY direction, other than straight down.
If it was so easy, we wouldn&#39;t need demolition experts. Even they can fail to make such a smooth collapse at times.</p>

<p>No other building of this type has EVER collapsed due to being weakened by fire. If we were to believe the official story, than building codes for the whole planet need to be changed. Yet 17 years later, all we get are engineers and architects saying &quot;nope, not possible.&quot;</p>

<p>Then there is the third building that collapsed that day, that was simply hit with some burning debree. Yet another first ever, and yet to be repeated.</p>

<p>There is tons of research on this topic, made by those with a lot more knowledge than myself. But since you cant be bothered to look up definitions  for symmetry(something that mirrors something else) or asysmetry(something that doesn&#39;t). I&#39;m not sure what you&#39;re looking to hear?</p>

<p>Maybe the asbestos in the building that would have cost millions if not billions to replace.</p>

<p>Maybe the guy who just bought the buildings and then received the biggest insurance payout ever.</p>

<p>Maybe the info on trillions of dollars that were held in building 7, and the hearing that involved them the next day. But oops, they&#39;re gone now, no backups.</p>

<p>Maybe the Israeli lobbying constantly for help against it&#39;s neighbors, but without public support, our deepstate (those in government that are there for decades/life) couldn&#39;t help.</p>

<p>tl;dr Somethings have already been researched to incredible depth. Simply search r/conspiracy for 9/11 and go for it. Most of the rest of us here have rehashed all this too many times, but it&#39;s still one of the best red pills to start with.</p>
