We accomplished nothing in nk but a photo op and legitimization of a mass murderer on the world stage. Thanks trump!

    <div class="md"><p>Wow I’m so glad that your propaganda keeps you well informed! Did you not notice that those photos your gods of truth and justice have served you are just photos of buildings and trucks?? (There are NO signs that they’re involved in nuclear weapons productions) Did you happen to miss the destruction of multiple nuclear sites by NK before and since DJ Trump had his summit??</p>

<p>Also, you used the cultist line which is just a projection of the nonsensical faith you fools have in the establishment. Bad news friendo, regardless of the way you want to view them, the facts remain the same. North Korea IS denuclearizing, and you’re promoting fake news which was an attempt to jeopardize us all in the first place.</p>

<p>Unlike you, I do not simply seek a source of news. I thoroughly vet ALL news and then research the facts for myself. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Jesus with the friendo friendo, I&#39;m cringing for you over here. Are you 12? Yeah sure, ok, because the <em>article</em> just shows photos, every country in the world who engages in satellite surveillance of nk must be conspiring to just pretend nk is continuing it&#39;s nuclear program because they just hate trump, peace, freedom, and America! Good lord it&#39;s pathetic. The pictures are there so they know what facilities are being referred to. It&#39;s reports coming from all over the world that provide context. But sure, go on with your fairy tale believing self. We got nothing out of this, and we gave too much already.</p>
