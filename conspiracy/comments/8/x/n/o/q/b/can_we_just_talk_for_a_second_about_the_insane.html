<p>I mean really? Marvels official account is continually posting garbage there. There is about 5 - 7  posts on r/All at any give time with 30k+ upvotes or more. Its insanely obvious that Marvel is marketing the fuck out of Reddit. </p>

<p>Without question the mods are either Marvel employees or just paid off losers, but is Reddit getting a cut in the pay? Are the admins making money off this? Its hands down the biggest example of marketing I&#39;ve ever seen on this website. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I’m with you on this one man. Went through all the posts today and the upvote counts combined with the golden showers straight out of a porno are ridiculous.  The mere thought of average redditors dumping 30 gold stars and 204k upvotes on Josh Brolin just for a video of him snapping his fingers is beyond ridiculous. 
Pyramid scheme this is not, but it certainly is blatant manipulation of the site on behalf of a company paying Reddit for an advertising campaign.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not pro eugenics. In a nutshell the character wanted to &quot;save the universe&quot; by killing half the population using a magic super power macguffin. His justification was that it will keep people from starving, preserve resources etc. However he was very intent on the people sacrificed being selected completely at random, &quot;young and old, rich and poor alike&quot;. It wouldn&#39;t be my chosen method of helping the universe, but there&#39;s a reason he&#39;s the villain.</p>

<p>My point is, it&#39;s distinctly not at all connected with eugenics.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>In a simple nutshell... Thanos is a &quot;bad guy&quot; in the Marvel comics universe.  He believes the universe is over populated.  He wants half of the population to disappear in order to allow the universe to continue.  In order to do so, he must collect these &quot;powerful&quot; stones that together give him the power to do just that.  </p>

<p>SPOILER</p>

<p>End of the last Avengers move, &quot;Infinity Stone&quot;, he gets the stones and simply snaps his finger to make half of the population of the universe disappear from existence.</p>

<p>Many of the people who watched the movie somewhat sided with Thanos...  saying he IS the bad guy but he DOES have a point.  He simply wants the universe to go on, and is willing to sacrifice anything to do so.</p>

<p>All subscribed users in that subreddit were up for &quot;banishment&quot; yesterday.  &quot;Thanos&quot; banned half of the community... just like in the movie...   Its simple marketing and big time Marvel fans have some fun, simple as that...  That movie was HUGE, probably one of the biggest movies of all time.  Marvel is currently HUGE from anyone 10 years old to well past 40.  I am in my late 30s and most of my co-workers are die hard Marvel fans...   its simply VERY popular right now.</p>

<p>Is that bad though?  I&#39;ve participated in reddit&#39;s April Fools events every year, and I have a blast with it.  People come together around some arbitrary event, have fun for a few days, and move on.  If some company can make a similarly enjoyable event that simultaneously markets their product, is that bad?  Is advertising inherently bad, or is there a way for a company to promote themselves in a way that isn&#39;t despicable?  I&#39;d much rather spend a week playing around with marvel nerds on Reddit than drive past billboards or hear the same 30 second spot over and over again, if I had to choose. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Just like newspapers exist to sell advertising, so does Reddit. Think how much it must cost to keep this site running, then think how many adverts you see. There should be a lot more adverts right? And there are but they&#39;re just not what we&#39;re used to seeing. I don&#39;t even think there is any legal obligation for online advertising to identify itself as such. So to answer your question, yes Reddit takes money from companies who make posts and comments that look innocuous but are paid adverts.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I participated a little in the subreddit. I think it began innocently enough but soon gained enough traction to get the attention of the marketers you are talking about. I think it was a clone of <a href="/r/EmpireDidNothingWrong">/r/EmpireDidNothingWrong</a> at the start. Once the idea of having a &#39;Snap&#39; like the movie, and removing half of the users (also following the plot of the movie), it became a huge arena for shitposting. That obviously attracted karma farmers and the like. </p>

<p>Now, where I think a conspiratorial angle entered was when the moderators approached the admins for help with the ban of half the users. Obviously, the moderation team does not have access to a list of subscribers. But the admins do. I feel that as I watched the &#39;Time-til-snap&#39; approach, it became more organized with a well thought-out approach from the moderators. I didn&#39;t watch that closely so I&#39;m not sure about moderator changes in the last week. But as the snap happened, the first user to be banned was /u/ dleary, a 12 year account and charter member. Soon I noticed a lot of Actor/Filmmaker accounts from the movies also being prominent in some of the first posts to <a href="/r/inthesoulstone">/r/inthesoulstone</a>. This is the subreddit you are supposed to join if you are banned from <a href="/r/thanosdidnothingwrong">/r/thanosdidnothingwrong</a>.</p>

<p>There are too many &#39;coincidences&#39; to not see this as nothing more than a marketing scheme. Reddit will Reddit.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>While I&#39;m guilt of liking youthful stuff(ie pokemon), I jnow deep down its wrong. Not because society says but because it is inherently simpler and as a person who values intelligence I should therefore b supporting more thought-provoking IPs as well as sharpening my own mind on them. There&#39;s also an element of &quot;growing up.&quot; Sounds corny AF, but essentially I see it as letting go of the easier indulgences in life as a spun off form of meditation or monkery. I think limiting instant gratification can be a good thing. Helps strengthen resolve if nothing else and helps one appreciate the stuff that really matters in life (family, friendship, persistence). Etc. and I say this as a guy literally this morning thinking about how Pokemon 2000 was the Star Trek 2 of the pokemon film series(ie part 1 sucked in both, part 2 lived up to hype). </p>

<p>You think companies stop marketing after the movie is released?</p>

<p>Disney owns Marvel. On the front page at any given time, there&#39;s usually at least one post about Marvel or Star Wars.</p>

<p>It&#39;s a campaign. They hype it so the fans stay invested.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Wow, a corporation would use a giant online communication platform to generate content that helps it promote itself and act as advertising? Oh no, what a horrible thing to do!</p>

<p>Come on dude, we live in capitalism where this kind of things happens all day everyday and there is absolutely zero surprise about this, this is not even worth discussing. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Are the admins making money off this?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Who knows? Even if they are, that is how society works right now and I don&#39;t think anything wrong with it. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Is reddit getting a cut in the pay?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Who gives a shit, there is so much more important things to discuss, suppose marvel did make some deal with admins and reddit staff to ride the wave of viral marketing campaign. <strong>SO WHAT?</strong> Do you know how often this happens on other platform, or in general on a global scale? Why don&#39;t you police every single instance of it then? </p>

<p>Just like u/durtysamsquamch said, there is no legal obligation for them to identify it as advertising and if people are dumb enough to waste their time on getting exited about being banned from some subreddit dedicated to some marvel show character then it is their problem. </p>
