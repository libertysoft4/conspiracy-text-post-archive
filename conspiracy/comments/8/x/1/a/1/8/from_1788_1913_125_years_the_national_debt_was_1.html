    <div class="md"><p>The more money you owe someone, the more interest you have to pay on it.</p>

<p>So while a debt figure of $21 trillion is a disaster for the people paying the interest, it&#39;s a never-ending bonanza for those to whom the interest is owed. It gets even better when you consider that much of this $21 trillion was created out of thin air by a privately owned central bank (the Fed).</p>

<p>This is the basic reason why the national debt will never go down. The US and most other nations are run like people farms. Most people are debt slaves and therefore equivalent to livestock. The farm owners are those who run the financial system that collects the benefits of everyone&#39;s hard work and funnels it upwards.</p>

<p>If you think &quot;Oh but that $21 T is Government debt&quot; yes you&#39;re right. But who has to go out everyday, work and pay taxes to that same government? Basically every American citizen with a job.</p>

<p>tldr; You live on a people farm... and you ain&#39;t the farmer.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>So while a debt figure of $21 trillion is a disaster for the people paying the interest, it&#39;s a never-ending bonanza for those to whom the interest is owed.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Neither of these statements is true. The U.S. Treasury bonds pay a very low interest rate and the interest payments are not &quot;a disaster&quot;. Since they pay a low interest rate, they are hardly a &quot;bonanza&quot; for those that purchase them. They are mainly valued as an investment because they are considered to be the safest long-term investment. </p>

<p>Also, the interest received from Treasury bonds is exempt from local and state taxation in the United States, so this makes them more attractive for rich people who live in high income tax states, like New York and California.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It gets even better when you consider that much of this $21 trillion was created out of thin air by a privately owned central bank (the Fed).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>None of the federal debt was &quot;created out of thin air&quot; by the Fed. All of the debt was explicitly authorized by Congress and sold at auction by the Treasury department. The Federal Reserve purchases a portion of the federal debt, but this doesn&#39;t increase the size of the debt.</p>

<p>Currently the Federal Reserve owns about $2.4 trillion in Treasury securities. The other $18.8 trillion is owned by other institutions, people, and government agencies. In 2016, the Federal Reserve received about $64 billion in interest from the Treasury bonds it owned. But the Federal Reserve paid $91 billion <strong>to</strong> the federal government. It is true that each of 12 Federal Reserve Banks is a corporation, technically owned by all the member banks, but they have very little in common with a typical private corporation. Almost all of the profits from the banks goes to the federal government.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This is the basic reason why the national debt will never go down.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The most important measure of the debt is as a percentage of the GDP, which indicates how much of a burden it is. In these terms, the debt <a href="https://imgur.com/grKBgOd">has gone down many times</a>.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Canada had a national bank until Pierre Trudeau sold it to international bankers. Roughly $75 million at founding and up to $300 million during our early days building railways and settling west. WWI and WWII saw it bounce from that to $3 billion and then $11 billion.  When the bank was sold, we were at $20 billion debt. We are at like $1.4 TRILLION now.  Our gold was sold off en masse in the 70s to the point we have 0 oz of gold in Canada.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>There is a lot of FUD around national debt. I&#39;m not an expert though, so anyone can feel free to correct me.</p>

<p>Debt in plain numbers is actually not very telling, and can even be pretty misleading. Debt-to-GDP is only about 10 times higher now than it was in 1913. Still very bad, but a factor of 10 is very different than a factor of 21,000. Imagine being salaried at 60k a year, and being 60k in debt. Not ideal, but this hypothetical actually isn&#39;t very uncommon due to student loans. </p>

<p>The United States still borrows money at a very low rate, much lower than what a single person can get a loan for. That rate is indicative of the general confidence in the country&#39;s ability to pay off its debt. Obviously the longer we sit on top of our debt, that number will change, and it could even change very rapidly. A lot of our governments debt is tied up in social security and is actually owed to...us. As more and more people reach the age where they stop contributing to SS and should start <em>receiving</em>...the government is forced to pay off its debts. If they are unable to do so, this is a scenario in which things could quickly take a downturn.</p>

<p>Our debt is a problem that needs to be addressed, but it&#39;s not quite a disaster, <strong>yet</strong>.  </p>
