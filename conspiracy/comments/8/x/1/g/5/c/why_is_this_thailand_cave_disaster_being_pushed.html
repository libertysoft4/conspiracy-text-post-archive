    <div class="md"><p>Yeah. Elon Musk. An individual- not &quot;the country&quot;. <em>Trump couldn&#39;t even mention him by name</em>- instead, he tried to imply that <em>America</em> did it. It&#39;s bullshit patriotism.</p>

<p>It&#39;s safe to claim responsibility for it when it works. If he really cared, he would have said something about this before now. He clearly didn&#39;t- he&#39;s just trying to hitch is wagon to Elon Musk, now that Elon Musk (and the efforts of the <em>other</em> countries) has started to succeed. It&#39;s completely telling that this is the first he&#39;s ever mentioned it. If the efforts had failed, we wouldn&#39;t be hearing a damn thing from Trump, and you know it.</p>

<p>America didn&#39;t do anything. Trump didn&#39;t do anything. Elon Musk did it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Prove he did. Trump never said anything about helping until someone else did the heavy lifting. He&#39;s already got a record of taking credit for the actions of others. Forgive me if I don&#39;t give him the benefit of the doubt this time.</p>
