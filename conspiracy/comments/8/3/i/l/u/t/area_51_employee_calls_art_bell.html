        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>There was a nice response to my previous post, of an Art Bell caller, so I figure I would bring up another one of my favorite callers.</p>

<p>In September of 1997, a guy calls into Art&#39;s show, frantically telling Art that he was a worker at Area 51. He sounds fairly distraught on his first call, which is &#39;cut off&#39; early. A week later, he supposedly called back, claiming his first call was a hoax.</p>

<p>It&#39;s a neat listen.</p>

<p>I hope you enjoy.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ee3bld4lTG0">First call</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>The first guy, if faking, had to be one of the greatest actors ever. You know how you can tell when someone is fake laughing? It&#39;s the same with hearing genuine terror in a voice, and that guy sounded genuinely terrified. The guy who called back was either a bad-acting opportunist who realized the first guy was never calling back, and called back in to get some fame (and to sell a book too iirc, which makes it seem even more like a scam), or a really bad acting government agent trying way too hard to mimic the voice of the first guy, and even trying to match the fear making his voice crack, which <em>makes no god damn sense.</em></p>

<p>Also, I just saw this comment to the first video:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>So, guys, I just did a bit of research. Apparently, the reason this guy lost transmission during his call is that their satellite had lost earth lock. That means that somehow their satellite was knocked out of position. Their satellite was knocked out of position
What the hell could have done that?﻿</p>

<p>How often does that happen? With tens of thousands of those things up there, you&#39;d think they&#39;d get hit with debris or knocked out of position all the time.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, it was only a Youtube comment.... </p>

<p>None of us have researched the claim.</p>

<p>Maybe Art Bell just switched off the caller because <em>it could otherwise compromise national security</em>....</p>

<p>you know, Bell or his team didn&#39;t necessarily <em>know for sure</em> whether it was a dangerous call... but I&#39;m sure they had instructions to be cautious if confidential info started to be said on air... to act before thinking it through!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That makes sense. He didn&#39;t want his show taken off air, so he would have been cautious. However, I would think, like any radio host, he could have just terminated the call. It was pretty convincing the way it went down. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think it&#39;s very unlikely the satellite got knocked out of position.

    <div class="md"><p>It goes deeper than all the people saying &quot;the call dropped&quot;. If i remember correctly, the call didn&#39;t just drop, the station lost power/connectivity in a way that had never happened before, as if someone had hacked into their systems and shut them down.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Indeed. Take the information as you want. Real? Hoax? Someone decided to knock it off the air either way.</p>

<p>The guy calling in to say it was a hoax and people buy that as debunked is dumb.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>IT WAS A HOAX AND ART BELL GOT CHUMPED.last time im going to clarify this for you. the area 51 caller called jimmy church. he was at the time he called art bell trying along with a friend for days,weeks trying to get through on open lines. they had the call very well planned out. they were part of,and still are involved in a traveling art theater company. he called jimmy and they re-staged the call. start the vid at around 2 minutes.they re-enact pretty much what happened on the art bell show.he goes through a series of call ins and then brings the actual caller on  his name is Brian glass.he comes on about 13:00 min mark.<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFYkFUC_h1Y">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFYkFUC_h1Y</a>             i will go further to suggest art bell knew it was a set up. art was suspected as having staged calls for years.</p>
