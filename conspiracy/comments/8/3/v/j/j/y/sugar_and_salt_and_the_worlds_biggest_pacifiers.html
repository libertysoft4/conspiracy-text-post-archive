        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>About a month or two ago, I noticed a change in my own behavior, being more passive and not caring about much anymore, and couldn&#39;t figure out why, but assumed it was my new, &quot;healthier&quot; diet. I was taking a shower one evening and noticed that I had a bit more &quot;body fat&quot; than I did the week before. Curious about what the hell was going on, I did some digging and found out that it wasn&#39;t fat at all, but water retention from sodium.</p>

<p>I cut a lot of sodium out of my diet, added in more potassium and water, and I feel 100% normal again.</p>

<p>Now, kidney&#39;s will hold sodium in response to carbohydrates consumption like sugar or grains or any food that isn&#39;t meat, fat, or fish etc.</p>

<p>What&#39;s in everyone&#39;s prepackaged food? SUGAR, SALT AND CARBOHYDRATES, and a ton of it.</p>

<p>The food industry along with the governments and literally pacifying the masses with sugar and salt added into high carbohydrate foods. Next time you buy bread or a pie what what-have-you, read the ingredients and nutrition facts. You will be just as disgusted as I am with the state of our food.</p>

<p>You can do this experiment on your own if you don&#39;t believe me: eat a high carb, high sodium diet and watch yourself decline into a state of mind lethargy and indifference. You lose all interest in things you previously had interest in, you&#39;ll have more energy but nothing to use it for other than work, and not mind work because your mind is numb.</p>

<p>Next time you encounter someone who seems so dumb and oblivious to the things that are happening around them, remember that it&#39;s not entirely their fault and their diet has an ENORMOUS impact on how their mind works.</p>

<p>WTF kind of diet do you have where you can notice weekly changes. Jesus fucking christ if your weight is changing more than 1kg per week then something is seriously fucking wrong. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m getting into microbiology with the intent to study gut flora and research more on how our little pals influence our body and mind, and especially the chemical feedback system where they tell you what to eat.  It&#39;s fascinating stuff, to me at least.  Articles like <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/how-gut-bacteria-tell-their-hosts-what-to-eat/">this one</a> keep me interested and focused on this stuff, and one day I hope to actually get involved with research.  I think there&#39;s amazing potential for helping people through specific modification of the types/amounts of bacteria in the gut, though at the same time probably a huge potential for harm.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My gf And I are basically following a ketogenic diet, we can eat anything that doesn’t have carbs or sugars, so our daily carb intake is less thank 20g of carbs. We managed to make most things including bread with minimal carbs, 2 grams per 2 slices, and pizza. The first week of doing this was hell, we felt like we were starving, after that the hunger just went away, almost fully, now I have to remind myself it’s time to eat, there’s no rumbling belly, no cravings. It has to do with our bodies producing the glucose it needs so it stays balanced and there’s no spikes. It’s pretty interesting how even though our food is more expensive now that we cut down on all the fillers like pasta, rice, bread, we eat less so our meats and veggies lasts us longer. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>When your body doesnt rely on over 100g of carbs for energy, it uses the liver to produce ketones from fat. Then you have blood sugar. You can eat green vegetables above the ground. Fruit is looked down upon though, except for berries. Fruit actually has a ton of carbs. So your body relies on fats and proteins instead of carbs. Your body begins to burn through your fat stores. This is the key of the low carb or keto diet. </p>

<p>When you eat a lot of carbs, the pancreas creates a ton of insulin to sop it all up and you get a rush, but then the crash. Your body is almost short circuited when it gets too many carbs and or sugar....all carbs convert to glucose in the body. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you&#39;re interested in the body and how it&#39;s affected by sodium and sugar you must try a legit Keto diet. What happens in the absence of sugar is the body has a greater need for water &amp; salt because it actually needs them to hydrolyze fat. In a sugary diet, the needs for salt and water aren&#39;t as high because you aren&#39;t hydrolyzing fat, but storing it, while retaining the water &amp; salt. This is forbidden knowledge because the truth makes sugar look like the root cause of all metabolic diseases. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Keto seems to me just as artificial as an industrial age, deadly and dirt-cheap sugar and flour diet - and that is because large amounts of fat in our food are also relatively modern occurrence since wild animals are usually lean and you must really force-feed a caged animal for it grow significant fat. Even at the beginning of husbandry (when we stopped hunting) the animals probably weren&#39;t fed so much because they were just sharing food with us - I doubt that there were many leftovers back then for our pigs to grow fat.. Vegetable oils the same, modern untested laboratory inventions.</p>

<p>Imo just eat mostly lean meat and a variety of vegetables and fruits (with some eggs, fish and nuts) with a bit of unprocessed carbs like beans, potatoes or whole grains (think of kebab instead of pizza, with a meat and vegetable stew being ideal), and drink water instead of soda. Small amounts of sugar are OK, just that there is a difference of life and death between 4 teaspoons a day and 20 teaspoons.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I couldn&#39;t disagree more. The times in my life when I pushed keto to the highest fat extremes are the times in my life that I felt the best, had the most energy and was completely indifferent to snacking, losing massive weight and looking hot instead of pear shaped. There&#39;s a hormone called Leptin that explains why. THEY don&#39;t want us to know about Leptin. They don&#39;t want us to know about hormones. They just demonize fat because it has all the VALUE in the recipe. This isn&#39;t a new idea. The word &quot;Banting&quot; means to lose weight. The word came from the name of the author who wrote the dietary book in which he stated the exact experience I had: the more fat you eat, the better you feel and faster you lose weight. 1863 this was known and Banting was famous because of it but all this modern misinformation has everyone brainwashed. Banting who? </p>

<p>Btw, I think that their fat-demonizing is an effect of their slow backtracking after it was revealed that much recommended artificial oils and margarines  are really full of poisonous trans-fats (but they couldn&#39;t admit that after all these government endorsed advertisements), so they just started to bash all fats - even necessary in healthy diet natural ones -  but that created an another trap among suspicious minds, which now can eat too much of them..</p>

I gained a lot back, And I got into a depression.. After getting back on track my weight dropped back down and I&#39;m back to feeling good again. Also I&#39;m barely ever hungry, and don&#39;t feel the need to eat but once a day.  I no longer crave all the sweets, fast food.  I&#39;m content eating the same thing every day. Usually turkey, hamburger or chicken. Last month I ate nothing but eggs. I urge everyone to make the switch, it&#39;s only hard the first week. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The most amazing part of cutting out carbs, or cutting back to 20 grams a day, was how clear headed I felt after a month.  I had no idea how much damage sugar was doing to my brain.  First two weeks of very low carbs I felt like shit, low energy, on edge, but a couple weeks in a fog lifted.  I wasn&#39;t a big sugar fan, I didn&#39;t eat candy, cake, anything like that, but my two mountain dew a day habit combined with eating bread, processed foods, etc. did me in.</p>

<p>I work with a guy who is 40.  I see him drink at least four 20 oz Cokes every day, has a ridiculous breakfast every day, today it was half a slab of ribs, two baked potatoes, and a huge ear of corn, Snickers at break, Kit Kat after lunch, potato chips all day, carry out food at night and he is fine.  He isn&#39;t diabetic, has no noticeable cognitive problems, so maybe it is just me but I can&#39;t see any circumstances under which I would go back to mainlining sugar again, I feel too well to travel that path. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>One interesting thing about carbs is that a lot of people think they&#39;re sensitive to gluten. The worst thing about carbs is actually the amount of lectin that&#39;s contained in grains. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Ingesting lectins can cause flatulence. Consuming legumes and grains in their raw form can even result in nausea, diarrhea and vomiting. Indeed, researchers speculate that many apparent causes of bacterial food poisoning may actually be lectin poisoning.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Source: <a href="https://www.precisionnutrition.com/all-about-lectins">https://www.precisionnutrition.com/all-about-lectins</a></p>

<p>Lectin confuses the gut, making it transfer fecal and bacteria into your bloodstream. If you soak grains for a while before eating them, or if you eat things made from sprouted grains, that can help with this problem as it releases the lectin. </p>

<p>Thought you&#39;d find that interesting about carbs. Sugar is a whole, much bigger conversation. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I read a study a while back that showed that poor people who cook their own food are healthier than the rich who never cook their own food.</p>

<p>There&#39;s two factors at play here: first of all, time. It&#39;s really easy to grab some fries at your favorite fast food joint, but <em>making</em> fries? That takes time. One could argue that if you had to peel your own potatoes, slice them up, coat them, dredge them, and deep fry them (twice) yourself, you probably would think twice before eating them.</p>

<p>The second factor is that you&#39;re less likely to cook with shitty food when you&#39;re making it yourself. God knows what&#39;s in those crackers, or that pepperoni stick you just bought, but you <em>know</em> what&#39;s in a can of beans.</p>

<p>In terms of budgeting, it&#39;s cheaper to cook for yourself, and you can eat healthier, but there&#39;s time involved.</p>

<p>I know there are a lot of subreddits, but <a href="/r/MealPrepSunday/">/r/MealPrepSunday/</a> comes to mind if you want inspiration. If you care to do a little digging I remember some subreddits that head meals on a budget as well.</p>

<p>The excuse of not having enough money is just an <em>excuse</em> - it isn&#39;t easy but you can make changes if you have enough motivation. </p>

<p>To assume this is one massive conspiracy ignores the obvious truth: sugar and salt are cheap and easy to add to food, and they make it taste better.</p>

<p>I can assure you that the vast majority of the thousands of food producers in the US aren&#39;t conspiring to make everyone fat and lazy - they are making products as cheap as they can, to sell them for profit. Sugar and salt are cheap.</p>

<p>Teachers make the difference - the curriculum can only go so far, but there are some teachers that are so good at what they do they have a lasting impact on a child&#39;s life well into adulthood.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, when I fast (don&#39;t eat) I feel much more conspiracy-minded and somehow clear-headed but as soon as I eat a small meal with lots of calories (no matter how much) I will get all &quot;it doesn&#39;t matter, everything&#39;s fiiiiine&quot; and I feel lightheaded and like I just wanna smile for no reason. It&#39;s been bothering me and has gotten me to avoid eating as often as I used to because I don&#39;t want to go back to being &quot;mindless&quot;. Hard to explain.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Quality post OP, thanks for taking the time. It&#39;s a damn shame that 28% of the &quot;users&quot; here disagree. Sure maybe they don&#39;t care about their health and that&#39;s fine, but before downvoting consider the unfortunate people that are unable to buy quality food or have no income or choice in what they eat. They almost certainly exceed the recommended sodium limit which is a little over two grams a day (one meal at fast food joint X is probably going to bring you to that limit). Ignoring this can lead to various undesirable conditions, most notably high blood pressure if you don&#39;t exercise regularly.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I drank nothing but sugar for decades, still do, and am pretty healthy. Only health issue is HBP but that&#39;s from smoking, stress, and salt, which I love and will never give up.
