        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Is fascinating to see center right movements from US fighting against police state, corporate power, mass population control and how they hate and fight the antifa movement at the same time.</p>

<p>In Europe the same battle the right does in US is fought by these left movements.</p>

<p>And you may think they are the same as antifa movements in US but they are not. These are old movements not tied down in crap like &quot;dumb feminism&quot; or &quot;don&#39;t offend me with your free speech&quot;</p>

<p>My belief is that the &quot;left&quot; antifa movements are artificially created to disrupt the people fight for a fair society, and the European antifascist symbols are used in US to discredit and divide the fight against unsettling situation of poverty and malcontent that is rising in the US society.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree with you 100% on the US Antifa movement. However I wouldn&#39;t be too sure the European movements are the real deal, either. TPTB always lead the opposition. Always. And if there is a genuine grassroots movement, it will quickly be infiltrated and derailed. They&#39;ve been at this game a very, very long time, and they know what they&#39;re doing. Same as it ever was. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>No they are not, they are in fact heavily infiltrated, you are right.</p>

<p>So my theory, and let me know what you think,</p>

<p>Europe movements genuinely created and then infiltrated to be controlled and disrupted.</p>

<p>US movements created directly just to be sure it doesn&#39;t happen as in Europe.</p>

<p>then off course, it depends of each community and different movement, each has its own story</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, I don&#39;t know. I wouldn&#39;t want to make a blanket statement. Depends which movements you&#39;re talking about. Do you have one in mind that you think was originally organic or grassroots but later was taken over?</p>

<p>Here is some interesting research on how various movements were controlled from the beginning, including <a href="http://mileswmathis.com/marx.pdf">Marxism</a>, <a href="http://mileswmathis.com/reed.pdf">socialism</a>, <a href="http://mileswmathis.com/debs.pdf">labor,</a> and <a href="http://mileswmathis.com/fakir.pdf">the Indian independence movement.</a> </p>

<p>By the way, antifa is not the first anti-fascist movement in the US. If you go back to the 30&#39;s, there was an anti-fascist movement. Though I imagine that was also manufactured by Intelligence. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Actually, ironically enough, it is what you say they are. Most of those Berkeley groups aren&#39;t antifa, don&#39;t call themselves antifa and don&#39;t act like antifa. </p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;ve known very right-wing antifascists, who were in the true original european antifascist movement that in large literally died out because of heroine addiction. I am sure that some of them sympathize towards communism or Che Guevara (the latter might also be considerd to be an example for antifascists because of his own anti-fascist fight, and not because of his ideology). However they are not core principles of the antifascist movement, nor is antifascism a core principle of communism - in fact, I would argue that communism has, almost by definition, very fascist elements - I really dislike the way people use different ideologies that are so easily separated, interchangably. I would argue the same is the case for people that call the alt-right nazis. Those people are equally stupid. Simply because one or two core elements are the same, doesn&#39;t mean that you can use the two terms interchangably when there are so many differences between them. </p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Interesting hypothetical, however poorly setup. The original antifascist movement didn&#39;t side with anyone, they were only anti. Whenever a group large enough appeared somewhere, that in their eyes had fascist ideology, they would come to try to fight them. So i imagine if enough fascist muslims would start demonstrating somewhere, the antifa would probably fight them. </p>

</blockquote>

<p>Hence the anti-fascists are the fascists quote. I agree with the above. There are a number of ideologies that the some are part of and some are not, in antifa groups</p>

<p>Hypocritically, the attackers become that which they are attacking, &quot;a group large enough.&quot;</p>

<p>I understand being anti-system and wanting a revolution, but Antifa has a lot of illogical bullshit associated with it. </p>

<p>fwiw, the hammer and sickle represents the soviet union, not communism per se.</p>

<p>che guevara would spit on them and call them putas. the facists he fought were US backed batistas. </p>

<p>antifa confuses things like racism with facism. the klan are a bunch of anachranistic rascists. all facists are statists. some racists of statists, some racists are anti-statists. all facists are pro-buisness. some racists are pro-business, some racists are anti-business. </p>

<p>if antifa were really anti-facistists they&#39;d target wall street, congress, esp congress, defense contractors, the news media, police departments, jeff bezos, alphabet etc. not the klan. don&#39;t get me wrong, protesting the klan is fine, but it is anti-racist, antira, not antifa.</p>

<p>antifarians were born and raised in a facist country as were their parents and grandparents.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Close, I would say fascism as an expression of Statist Authoritarianism. The original form fascist ideology could be defined as right-wing exclusive: G-B, Italy, Germany to a certain extent, however ever since WWII more and more left-wing movements in mostly non-European countries have been considerd fascist (mostly africa, and asia). If you were to look at a modern-day example of what I would qualify as left-wing, or at the very least not right-wing fascism, you would have to look at the Philipines. Just for your interest, the term fascism is still a contested concept and there are multiple definitions being used. If you see fascism as political ideology, it has mostly been eradicated after WWII. If you see it as a set of principles and actions, it is still very much alive.</p>

<p>And that&#39;s why I am centrist, because I don&#39;t want a white ethnostate. I want everyone united and whats best for the country as a whole.</p>

<p>But at the same time, the white neighborhoods are the safest and best places to live. So it makes sense why some would want a white ethnostate.</p>

<p>No, see that is the issue. It has little to do with the color of their skin and more do with their economic situation. There are poor white neighborhoods with just as much crime as poor black neighborhoods.</p>

<p>Sure, skin color is one of them. There are also racial genetics that allow companies like 23andme to let people know what racial background they consist of.</p>

<p>Now I am aware that there are a lot of recent (last few years) articles of scientists arguing that race does not exist. I haven&#39;t looked into this that much, other than a few debates that this itself is a conspiracy by liberal scientists as well.</p>

<p>Even if we were to argue whether race exists or not (because I can post sources from both sides), we still have cultures, countries, skin color, religion, and many other things that divide and separate the people between themselves.</p>

<p>For example, I 100% agree with Churchill on Islam:</p>

<p><a href="https://i.redd.it/0oc2iidp5bl01.png">https://i.redd.it/0oc2iidp5bl01.png</a></p>

<p>As an ideology, it is probably the most dangerous one in the world, along with Satanism, Communist ideologies that led to Gulags, Globalist policies, etc</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Did you know that being exposed to Malaria is what leads one to being susceptible to sickle cell?</p>

<p>I wasn&#39;t going to use the sickle cell argument.</p>

<p>As of right now, I 100% believe that races exist. However, things get blurry when we have mixed people, mixed race folks who are beyond 2 backgrounds, but have several/multiple backgrounds.</p>

<p>TL:DR - I believe races exist, but am on the fence in terms of what that means beyond skin color and genetics</p>

<p>Ah here you are using a key word, culture. Yes different cultures have different behavior and growths. That has little to do with race as it is classically defined though.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Sure, skin color is one of them.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Skin color is based on where your ancestors grew up in relation to the equator. Did you even peruse the link I gave you? It has no distinct racial component outside of showing where your ancestors grew up.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I haven&#39;t looked into this that much, other than a few debates that this itself is a conspiracy by liberal scientists as well.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Of course, because saying race isn&#39;t a biological factor is a conspiracy. This isn&#39;t like gender where biologically there are differences between the genders.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>we still have cultures, countries, skin color, religion, and many other things that divide and separate the people between themselves.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Culture, nationalism, religion, and most of the things you listed are created by a group of people. There is no biological component those are just tribalism wherein different is strange and uncomfortable. Skin color is meaningless just like hair color is.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>As an ideology, it is probably the most dangerous one in the world, along with Satanism, Communist ideologies that led to Gulags, Globalist policies, etc</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Ideology and religion has nothing to do with race though. White people can be Muslim. debating which ideologies are damaging is outside the scope of this conversation.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>As of right now, I 100% believe that races exist.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What is something that defines a race though? You didn&#39;t really answer that. Skin color is not satisfactory as there are light skinned Africans and dark skinned Europeans. What biological (and this is about biology not culture or religion) feature is distinctive to a single race?</p>

<p>Ah here you are using a key word, culture. Yes different cultures have different behavior and growths. That has little to do with race as it is classically defined though.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Sure it has to do with race. There are cultures based on race, geography, skin color that are not found anywhere else in the world</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Skin color is based on where your ancestors grew up in relation to the equator. Did you even peruse the link I gave you? It has no distinct racial component outside of showing where your ancestors grew up.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes I did read it. Skin color has much more to do than &quot;just where ancestors grew up.&quot; There is going to be connections to culture, epigenetic differences, and a shit ton of other factors</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Of course, because saying race isn&#39;t a biological factor is a conspiracy. This isn&#39;t like gender where biologically there are differences between the genders.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Genetics studies are EXTREMELY CONTROVERSIAL:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Modern geneticists now take pains to distance their work from the racist assumptions of eugenics. Yet since the dawn of the genomic revolution, sociologists and historians have warned that even seemingly benign genetics research can reinforce a belief that different races are essentially different—an argument made most famously by Troy Duster in his book Backdoor to Eugenics. </p>

<p>Academia has a massive Liberal Bias:</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberal_bias_in_academia">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberal_bias_in_academia</a></p>

<p>So right off the bat, we are finding various issues and gray areas with all of this</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Culture, nationalism, religion, and most of the things you listed are created by a group of people.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes and those with different races, have different religions, cultures, etc</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Ideology and religion has nothing to do with race though.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Sure they do. Majority of Buddhists are Asian. Majority of Muslims are Arab/Persian/Turk, Majority of Christians are white, etc</p>

<blockquote>
<p>White people can be Muslim. debating which ideologies are damaging is outside the scope of this conversation.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Its all related, that&#39;s my point</p>

<blockquote>
<p>What is something that defines a race though?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Asian slanted eyes, Indian skin tone different from black/latin skin tone, and various other genetic differences that are in that .01% that allows a scientist to figure out ancestry. I would even argue there are subconscious and epigenetic differences as well, ones that do not allow Africa to become a powerful first world country</p>

<blockquote>
<p>What biological (and this is about biology not culture or religion) feature is distinctive to a single race?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Listen, I can&#39;t fully argue or debate this with you, because I am not 100% well versed on these matters at this point.</p>

<p>I am on the fence about a lot of things in this conversation. I think there are both Universalities in Humans, as well as differences, and this conversation isn&#39;t just about science/genetics, but also has to do with philosophy, spirituality, group consciousness, racial consciousness/awareness, epigenetics, karmic soul groups, the hive mind subconscious, and a number of other features.</p>

<p>So its not black and white for me, but very VERY gray area</p>

<p>Again from your source:</p>

<p>&quot;In a later, 2013 study, Gross compared Rothman, Licther, and Nevitte&#39;s corrected data, data collected by the Higher Education Research Institute (HERI) in 2004 and 2005, and Gross and Simmons&#39; PAP survey, noting that all three data sets suggested that between 50 and 60 percent of professors were liberal, and that it was a &quot;reasonable conclusion&quot; that &quot;between 50% and 60% of academics fall somewhere on the left side of the political spectrum.&quot;&quot;</p>

<p>So a bit over half. I don&#39;t deny that especially in fields outside of STEM there is a large liberal bias. Fortunately genetics/biology is a STEM field so I don&#39;t believe it is as prevalent there.</p>

<p>But we aren&#39;t talking about its origins, and in the modern world today Muslim is not arab/persians/turks.</p>

<p>Look here is the ottoman empire:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.britannica.com/place/Ottoman-Empire">https://www.britannica.com/place/Ottoman-Empire</a></p>

<p>Here is the Persian:</p>

<p>Neither of them go past India. The current Muslim population is more Asian than arabic/persian/turkish. That alone defeats your idea that religion relies on race or vice versa. How it was spread is inconsequential to the debate on race.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Slanted eyes, black hair, a very specific skin color and look, can be identified by pretty much anyone all over the world, as being Chinese, Korean, or Japanese.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Ok, and what makes up that race besides superficial genetic variations? Race is just skin color, facial features, and hair color? These variations are literally skin deep and like skin color have likely relatively benign reasons for evolution. This is the question that is more the heart of the matter when it comes to race discussions.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>And yet they have genetic biomarkers that show their ancestry.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Maybe, or maybe superficial features aren&#39;t that important. Saying you can visually tell someone&#39;s ancestry isn&#39;t the same as saying genetics with multiple markers can eliminate statistical variance.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If that really were the case, then scientists would not be able to pinpoint ancestry in terms of country</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So all race is now is a sign of what part of the world you were born in? Ok, that&#39;s fine; that isn&#39;t usually how people define race but that doesn&#39;t bother me. It offers no more than a guidebook not a definite reality.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>This is evidence of genetic/epigenetic mutations within a single population yes. I suppose if that is all race is to you. Where it becomes unclear and the difference between ancestry and a traditional definition of race is how much it has an influence on you as a person; and if there is any reason besides superficial ones we can&#39;t get along.</p>

<p>I think the &quot;there are no races they are just constructs&quot; argument is a liberal psy op, just like the whole &quot;gender is just a construct&quot; debate.</p>

<p>I think race = Ancestry, genetic identifiers, differences in the subconscious and consciousness, skin color/physical features, differences in cognitive abilities such as logic/reason/intelligence, personality differences, and so on.</p>

<p>Many of the branches of thought and reasoning of mine above, is still not understood by science. I also ascribe to these philosophies as well:</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collective_unconscious">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collective_unconscious</a></p>

<p><a href="https://silentconsort.wordpress.com/2009/07/23/racial-memory-collective-unconscious-jung/">https://silentconsort.wordpress.com/2009/07/23/racial-memory-collective-unconscious-jung/</a></p>

<p>So on top of all of those features, I see cultures as a representation of the subconscious hive mind, or collective consciousness if you will.</p>

<p>In terms of Epigenetics, it is argued that the stereotypes of races are examples of this. I am, for example, of East European Slavic origins where Alcoholism is rampant and have lost my father and an uncle to alcohol poisoning. These same cravings are something I battle with constantly and certainly these are argued to be epigenetic memories.</p>

<p>Even our society now has diversity quotas and affirmative action and cultures/societies are built around race, enough so that people pretend to be another race, like black for example, to take advantage</p>

<p>There are large variances in animal species, and clearly animals are not &quot;One Animal race&quot;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Is the highest intelligence black person less smart than the highest intelligence white person?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It depends on whether a study was done on this. I dont know, but I&#39;d guess if you take 1000 white people and test them compared to 1000 white people or asian people, the black people will be seen to have the lowest cognitive ability in some facets, but higher cognitive ability in other facets (such as physical, reaction, sports, awareness, etc). If this study is in the U.S., I would argue this is so because the blacks that came to the U.S. was via slavery boats and the males were chosen for their physical acumen  </p>

<p>Yup, this is what sets these races apart from those who don&#39;t have this. There are many more facets/aspects, like this example, that further set apart the races</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Epigenetics might tie into your own personal family history sure, but there is little reason to suspect a large racial component.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Actually, there are many reasons that epigenetics can be seen as racial components, and plenty of articles that discuss this as well in academia. They are super scared that racists will take their work and use it to further racists debates. So it makes sense why all of a sudden, in the last few years, there is a psy-op from liberal biased academia, to come out with this &quot;no races&quot; propaganda.</p>

<p>What&#39;s really interesting is to see whether these same sort of articles/studies exist in Eastern Academia (India/Asia/Middle East/Etc) where Academia has a better balance towards conservatism </p>

<p>Even if there differences are found in 0.1% of genetics, its still genetic and biological.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>

<p>It&#39;s relative. Who is it, that gets to define race, and by what biases?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Way to cherry pick one thing I disputed that I probably care about the least. I never said consciousness does not exist; I am saying your theory there is some racial variance of that consciousness is beyond even beginning to prove or disprove.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Actually, many scientists predict that consciousness will be scientifically figured out in X times. There are a variety of social, cultural, psychological studies/experiments that point to various markers within different races and it can be argued culture is a product of race and not the other way around.</p>

<p>A good experiment would be to take a bunch of Asian babies and allow them to start their own culture in a number of echo chambers to see what happens as they get older. There are arguments that these children will display various examples of ancient Asian culture playing out in their behavior and culture creation because its within their subconscious and epigenetics to do so, and therefore we can argue race exists because of this</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Yes far larger than we can find in the human species. That is why traditional classification of race in taxonomy doesn&#39;t even begin to apply. It is a special human classification of race regardless of its existence or not.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Even then, we can take 1 species like lemurs, who have various different races/variations/sub-species with minimal genetic difference, but they still stay within their own groups</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Perhaps, it certainly lines up with stereotypes about the situation. Measuring intelligence is incredibly complicated on its own and in fact hard to measure in a fair way.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I agree the standard IQ test is limited in its ability, however there are other intelligence tests available, and I would argue these tests are enough to line up with both stereotypes and the the demographics we see in typical American Universities, or Global, by country, demographics on education</p>

<blockquote>
<p>So your argument is nationality is race now?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A part of it, sure</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Most people that use race limit it to 4-5 distinct races. So how many races are there?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;m not sure. There are what can be deemed subsets like Icelandic, Alaskan, etc. However these same 2 groups are often included as other racial groups. While I do believe race exists because of the various branches of thought, links, philosophies, I have listed, in terms of how many there are, I&#39;m not sure.</p>

<p>I also believe that perhaps, a person who is mixed with a number of different races, at a certain point loses the purity of 1 race, and I am not sure what that really signifies. Perhaps there is a evolutionary movement towards homogeneity like how some scientist are predicting there will only be one race of all mixes in the future:</p>

<p><a href="https://mic.com/articles/87359/national-geographic-determined-what-americans-will-look-like-in-2050-and-it-s-beautiful#.D6sh4hBVz">https://mic.com/articles/87359/national-geographic-determined-what-americans-will-look-like-in-2050-and-it-s-beautiful#.D6sh4hBVz</a></p>

<p>I think perhaps us reaching that is evolution doing so for the purpose of reaching less differences and entering a future utopia</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Also, do you have evidence Eastern Europeans are worse than any other Caucasian grouping? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Pretty loaded question. I&#39;m sure I can gather evidence, but it would be relative.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It seems to me you are happy to accept the stereotypes of each &quot;race&quot; and then shift race to mean whatever you want in each sentence.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I think there is something to stereotypes yes, but I dont shift &quot;race&quot; as you say above. I believe there is race and have laid out my argument. I dont shift to find conveniences </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Sure but even .1% hasn&#39;t been shown to exist exclusively to a race.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That doesn&#39;t matter. If 99.9% of genetics and epigenetics is meant for the activities of the body, but only .1% is meant for racial difference, then that is sufficient </p>

<blockquote>
<p>First of all this debate WAY predates the &quot;last few years&quot;. People have been searching for evidence of races and finding little for centuries.</p>

<p>Not everyone in science agrees. The above is hardly settled</p>

<blockquote>
<p>No it is completely shifting the definition and meaning of race. The reason race is a taboo subject is because some people say your &quot;race&quot; has a definition of what you are or what your potential is.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Its hardly shifting. Who the hell is defining what race is and why are they limiting to their terms? We already have bias from the onset of the definition. I am hardly shifting anything. All I am doing, is giving you a basis on what Race means to me, and questioning the agreed upon biases</p>

<p>I understand, but some argue that race influences culture, not the other way around</p>

<p>Meaningless is limited by your definition of what race is, which is itself limited and biased by what scientists have a status quo on what they think it means.</p>

<p>Just rile up some white pride people and give them media coverage to create an illusion relevance to them.</p>

<p>your comment is probablly the most apt in the thread.</p>

<p>antifarians expose themselves in their thin skinnedness and knee jerk down voting.</p>

<p>i&#39;m your garden variety, untrademarked, 1980s punk, anarchist. i would have less animosity toward antifarians if they would cease and desist calling themselves anarchists. no anarchist ever has told someone what they can think or that they have to be respectful to anyone, as long as you don&#39;t interfere with them.</p>

<p>interference is intereference. violence is violence. if you commit interfere with someone or commit violence, i could care less whatever justification you tell yourself to allow you to feel righteous and assuage your cognitive dissonance. i feel equally about this for antifa and for those they mislabel as facists.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The fact that they&#39;re actually not, and it&#39;s a hilariously bad lie they use to shield themselves. For example, they beat up a mexican old man and his teenage son with a sign that read &quot;End violence, end racism, peace&quot; and you could see through their masks they were white people. The dad and son did nothing except walk past them and were all confused and asking &quot;why are you doing this to us&quot; as they were on the grass getting mauled.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>antifa is neither for, nor against, anything but whatever rally they show up at.</p>

<p>ask any supposed antifarian what facism is. it can be defined in one sentence. they won&#39;t be able to tell you. they might cite historical attributes, but most will not really be actual attributes, they will be hollywood portrayals of them. they might cite various identity based animosities, none of which are facist, just shitty. ask them what the difference between US facism and NAZI facism, they won&#39;t know (german facism is based on prussia-philia, US facism is based on profit margins. henry wallace gave a great description of it back in 1945). ask them what anarchism is. it can be defined in one sentence. they won&#39;t be able to tell you, they won&#39;t even be able to come up with attributes. bonus question--ask them why calling oneself antifa is redundant if you are an anarchist.</p>

<p>be warned, they are very hostile and suffer from astounding levels of dunning kruegar.</p>

<p>antifa clearly popped up here as an astroturf thing, but like most astroturf things, sincere, useful idiots hopped on board. search american anarchist subs and websites and articles before 2016. count how many times antifa is mentioned.</p>

<p>heh, maybe antifa is just 13 russian shitposters...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If it can be claimed that antifa is fabricated for such reasons, then it can be claimed that neo-nazis and &quot;alt-right&quot; folk who make public appearances are fabricated to discredit right wing politics. And the main reason why the center and right wingers oppose antifa and extreme leftists is because they are more anti-free speech and most of their social activism involves attacking and attempting to silence others speeches and public events. Do you really think these extreme leftists and antifa care about fixing social issues? They just want power over other people.</p>
