If you want to talk US government conspiracies, this is the man to listen to. Kevin Shipp has received two CIA Meritorious Unit Citations, three Exceptional Performance Awards and a Medallion for overseas covert operations.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I watched this last weekend, highly recommended. What this guy has had to go through just for doing his fucking job, to try to protect the lives of his own co-workers, is utter bullshit. He apparently exposed something that certain elements within the cia actually WANT to exist. They want that vulnerability. I can think of several reasons why, and they all seem to lead to either sedition or treason IMO. He should have been rewarded &amp; promoted for his work. Considering what actually did happen to him instead, says a lot about the current state of that agency.   I found a lot of correlations with Bill Moyers breakdown of the DeepState too. This guy simply takes it further by drilling down past the DeepState, and into the Shadow Government. They are not the same thing, but are intimately connected. He also makes note of the upper, upper elite oligarchy, &amp; their proclivity for dark occultic beliefs (it&#39;s just the reality, people), but smartly doesn&#39;t focus on it, because there is enough &#39;real world&#39; corruption within these elements of our gov to focus on without sinking down into the REALLY dark stuff. He does allude to it, just sounds like he&#39;s not going to go there. He doesn&#39;t need to. The corruption of the agency is bad enough, even though it&#39;s just <em>barely</em> the tip of the iceberg. Stay safe Mr Shipp &amp; thank you for coming forward.</p>

<p>How can we act?  I am genuinely curious and looking to take action in  any way possible.  I see people say we have to be active in our fight, but short of a revolt what can we do?  I completely agree with being active, but I really would like to explore other avenues other than protesting, voting, and making calls.  Obviously not enough people are active enough because nothing happens.  So I continue to ask people often, what else can we do?  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yup I get you. I feel like one thing we can do is make these whistleblowers mainstream. People worship celebs like they&#39;re gods- I think these whistleblowers trying to save the lives of the American people deserve to be famous too. The more eyes we can have on credible people with credible, no BS info, the less likely they&#39;ll get swept up in the madness of disinfo. Its creating a cultural truth movement which shows the mainstream world that truthers are not people to be ignored. The injustice must be magnified. He didn&#39;t go into a lot of it, but the sexual/physical abuse of children to control/blackmail people in power is not something that will stay hidden much longer and will bring many people together despite party lines. That is the unity we need. I understand your frustration completely.</p>

<p>The majority of conspiracy followers most definitely don&#39;t use Facebook - if we could get this trending on there or Twitter it might have an impact.</p>

<p>As has been said already in this thread he lays out how easy it is for the letter agencies to cover up events such as 9/11 without issue. The main reason most people discredit most conspiracies is because &quot;how would someone not have blow the whistle already?&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Fails the 9/11 litmus test... HARD. Tries to pin it on Saudi Arabia and goes with the big scoop &quot;ZOMG The US let it happen on purpose!&quot; No, dummy. It was Israeli Mossad with help from the inside.</p>

<p>I&#39;m halfway through the 2nd video, but so far there&#39;s just the briefest mention of Israel, no mention of AIPAC, no mention of their involvement in 9/11 or the wars in the Middle East. I&#39;ll eat my words if he gets into all that in Part 3, but I don&#39;t think it&#39;s happening.</p>

<p>Still...</p>

<p>It&#39;s a good introductory video for normies. Even though I think it holds too much back and (at least so far) twists it to indemnify Israel, there&#39;s only so much a normie can intake and process all at once. <em>JUST THIS</em> will be mind-blowing and life-changing to many, if not most, people.</p>

<p>So I dunno.. Should we spread it? I don&#39;t know. Hm.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Okay so if you guys look at this differently, Kevin Shipp isn&#39;t much of a whistleblower and is a poor source of information. First, it is his goal to make the CIA look bad, so he appears to have had a valid lawsuit with them, and now calls himself a whistleblower to sell books and make money. He claims they blackmailed him and ruined his life to silence him. Wrong.</p>

<p>Describing his father after he &quot;quit&quot; the CIA for stealing of a government credit card, his son said this:
It ended up causing my father to drink, and medically, physically and mentally, it took our lives,” Joel said. “It took my father’s pension, it took all our belongings, my family eventually had to file for bankruptcy.”</p>

<p>He gave a list of things they did to him, which are more easily explained as consequences to aforementioned actions.
He claimed they raised interest rate on all INTERNAL loans... well yeah you were dishonorably discharged they arent gonna keep hooking you up with the cia loan deal. blocked retirement funds but he quit after 15 years... same reason, forced into foreclosure cause you &#39;resigned&#39;, blocked employment from cia subs because how can you get hired for a subcontractor of your resignation/firing from previous organization, large legal expenses - trying to recover everything you lost through some bs lawsuit, medical bills... you lived in a moldy place and didnt do anything about it but knew about it?  ... lost everything we owned... you didnt have to destroy all your shit, but did to build a case and justification for stealing with the gvt card. He steals, gets caught, then files a lawsuit. Also, is it likely the CIA would allow a decorated CIA agent and his family live in a toxic house and cover it up rather than fix it?
 He isn&#39;t a whistleblower, he only had unclassified documents about a few things dating no later than 2001. </p>

<p>He stretched a lot of truths in his examples and is really just mad that he lost his job and wife so he wants to take down the CIA. He was fired for stealing with a government credit card. The bomber crash he mentions in the third video wasn&#39;t as sketchy as he makes it sound, had incorrect info on it, and he destroys credibility for himself saying the national security act of 1947 needs to be rescinded is dumb. I get what he&#39;s saying but it&#39;s all shit everyone with common sense already knows. He doesn&#39;t even have info after 2002 from inside the CIA but he&#39;s talking about present issues... this is a guy who messed up his life and wants attention because he can&#39;t do anything else but sell books to conspiracy theorist. </p>
