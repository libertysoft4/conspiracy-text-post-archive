    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>Do you believe there is any truth to this?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I don’t “believe” or “disbelieve” statements made by almost anyone, to be honest with you.  “Belief” is what one tends to rely upon when one doesn’t have any type of real understanding or logical rudder to steer them in the appropriate direction when coming to a perspective on any given subject or issue.  What I do is assess the statements that are made by any source in question against a rational strata of logical thinking and see how those statements weigh against what’s actually happening in the world that exists.</p>

<p>With this in mind, the information in the linked articles, specifically the one I commented on, talks about a particular mode of being - a perspective that one can have on the world, if you will - whose end result, as far as I can see, ultimately makes logical sense:</p>

<p><em>Humanity is a creature with much to learn.  The Earth is fraught with many traps, dangers, and misleading pathways that can easily lead one very much astray.  When assessing the world around you and your journey through the treacherous waters of life, try to manage “the middle way” - don’t allow yourself to get too high; don’t allow yourself to go too low.</em></p>

<p>This ultimate lesson imparted in The Hidden Hand Interview is one that I think is rather valuable and would do well to be focused upon by many individuals on this planet.</p>

<p>Independent of the particular and specific veracity or truth behind any individual statement made in the Interview, this ultimate lesson imparted from the information is, I feel, a sufficiently valuable one.</p>

<p>Ab-so-<em>lute</em>-ly it does.  It’s absolute blasphemy to some for sure.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Do you mean Genesis was purposefully mistranslated to hide the truth, or the HH info was purposefully mistranslated to hide the truth.  If you meant the former, I certainly wouldn’t disagree with that in the least.  As a matter of fact, William Bramley’s important book “The Gods Of Eden” (<a href="http://www.whale.to/c/Gods_of_Eden_Bramley.pdf">pdf here</a>) goes into this very topic in <em>great</em> detail.  It’s an utterly fascinating read and I very much recommend going through it.</p>

<p>Absolutely, sir.  Indeed.  Everything is everything.</p>

I read it about once a year and it screws me up for a few days, but helps me center myself and delve inside for a bit.

<p>Yes, sir.  That indeed is what the information can definitely tend to do.  It had the same effect on me when I first read it as well.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Yep.  This guy gets it.  The real import of the information involves its exhortation to focus on one’s self, on one’s reactions to things, and on having as evolved and equanimous approach to the things around you as possible.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>The known “elites” are nothing more than “king rats” (see <a href="http://www.whale.to/c/Gods_of_Eden_Bramley.pdf">chapter 25 in this pdf here</a> for an explanation of what the term “king rats” means).</p>

<p>I have a physical copy as well.  It’s dense, and absolutely choc full of information - a very serious read.  I imagine it’ll be a while before you get it, read it, and are done with it (easily weeks I imagine), but if you remember, definitely come back here - or just pm me or whatever - and let me know what you think of it.  Would definitely like to know your thoughts on it after you’re done.</p>

<p>That seems to be a right path to follow as far as I am concerned.  I do this as much as possible myself as well.  I let my intuition guide me along with as much analysis and critical thinking as I can muster on whatever given subject I’m looking into.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It seems perhaps that you’re allowing yourself to get stuck in a type of indoctrination (religious or otherwise) that causes you to be knee-jerkingly averse to going further and looking deeper into the meaning of what&#39;s presented here.  I say this because if you actually did look deeper, you would understand that independent of whether the source of the information is “luciferian” or whatever it might be, the fact of the matter is that the ultimate message that got communicated by the HH material actually <em>is</em> in fact a valid one.</p>
