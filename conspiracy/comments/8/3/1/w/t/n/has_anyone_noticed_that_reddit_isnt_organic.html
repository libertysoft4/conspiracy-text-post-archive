        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>This site is fucking cancer now, has anyone noticed that every post will always be downvote brigaded after like the first 10 minutes. SJWs &amp; shils basically dominate any populated subreddit, they will use the downvotes to censor every single opinion that goes against the norm &amp; it will quickly devolved in a manufactured conversation. Example go on askreddit for example, sort by new &amp; give your honest opinion on any gender, politics or religion related post. Your comment will be most likely upvoted to the top at first, but downvoted to the bottom every single time as the hivemind takes over the entire post by downvote brigading nearly everyone. Resulting in a manufactured thread where essentially the same comments will be at the top, and everything that they don&#39;t want us to see is quickly downvoted to the bottom. Its like they are basically trying to control the narrative.</p>

<p>The same is true on r/conspiracy, most of this subreddit seems to be full of shills. They don&#39;t even believe in conspiracy theories and have a sole purpose to basically downvote brigade any sensitive topic &amp; control the narrative by posting the same shilling comments that get somehow upvoted to the top every single time. 
And what&#39;s more is that the mods do absolutely nothing about this, even though shilling apparently is against one of this site&#39;s direct rules. What the fuck happened to Reddit, its like voat has now become what this place used to be. but not surprisingly any positive mention of voat will always be downvoted to hell. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It’s crazy that you care more about winning this little battle than losing the war against the elites and our increasingly tyrannical government.</p>

<p>But sure, keep playing into their hand. They’ve done a brilliant job of making people like you think “she lost” whenever someone questions Trump. They’ve managed to convince you that any criticism of him must imply support for her, and that any criticism should be dismissed as “liberal whining”.</p>

<p>The result is that Trump is left entirely unchecked, because anyone who Tries to hold him accountable is just “continuing the constant attacks”. Even if he does something actually wrong and someone questions him on it, it doesn’t matter at this point because he has a huge base of supporters who will simply refuse to believe it.</p>

<p>They’ll go so far as to make up excuses for why it must not be true, to attempt to misrepresent and discredit the criticism, to deflect with jokes, and sometimes to simply not listen at all.</p>

<p>What do you think t_d is supposed to do? It’s supposed to make sure that anyone initiated into the delusion sees only a steady diet of information designed to confirm and maintain their beliefs.</p>

<p>There’s now a sizable population of people who only believe right wing media, only browse t_d, and only interact with fellow devotees.</p>

<p>A few of you leaked out to <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> a couple years ago and proceeded to try to move this sub away from an honest quest for the truth towards something more similar to t_d.</p>

<p>And you pull the same crap here that everyone there does. You only believe right wing sources, you immediately disregard any other sources, you deflect with jokes, post misinformation which to you appears as legitimate, and generally attempt to corral the narrative to create another safe space here as there is in t_d. A place where anyone “initiated” (who spends most of their time on reddit and consumes most of their media from this sub) is protected from seeing views which are critical of Trump.</p>

<p>Of course it’s failed miserably because there’s plenty of information which is critical of Trump and this sub doesn’t have the same moderation policies as t_d where dissenting opinions are simply removed outright.</p>

<p>This isn’t a secret either, t_d has been proven to engage in this sort of behavior in a number of subs. They toned it down after the admins took action when they were more overt about it before.</p>

<p>That’s the point of t_d, an advertisement for Trump and an attempt at controlling the narrative. Is it any surprise that people who bought into this care more about controlling the narrative than uncovering the truth?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>All of that wall of text and it&#39;s nothing but a nice, big, juicy strawman. Holy cow, well done. I haven&#39;t seen one of these before.</p>

<p>Your entire post boils down to accusing the people who talk about Hillary here of essentially supporting Trump by not discussing him, and/or being right wing nuts who come from t_d using right wing sources. I call absolute, complete <em>horseshit</em> on this. It actually pisses me off how inaccurate your little pretentious tirade is.</p>

<p>By &quot;not questioning Trump,&quot; I get the feeling like you&#39;re referring to anyone not completely swallowing this insane Russian hysteria bullshit that&#39;s been on the news 24/7, because that&#39;s a narrative that&#39;s been pushed around here before. But guess what? Many great outlets, journalists, politicians, and whistleblowers (Greenwald, Sibel Edmonds, Kevil Shipp, Ron Paul, James Corbett, Robert Parry, Whitney Webb, VIPS, etc.; notice none of these are &quot;alt-right&quot;) who have been correct time and time again make good cases as to why all of that is bullshit. At the same time, they are vocal about Trump&#39;s choices, foreign and domestic. They were vocal about his missile strikes in Syria, his appointing Goldman Sachs, Zionists, Neocons, and the lowest of the low scumbags into his administration, his pathetic tax code, and so on. Is Trump and co. corrupt and probably involved in money laundering, tax evasion, fraud, etc? You fucking bet they are, along with the people doing the &quot;investigating.&quot; Is Trump a Russian Manchurian Candidate, and did the Russians have any meaningful impact on the elections? Nope.</p>

<p>You know what&#39;s been muddying the waters? This Russia bullshit which continually distracts from those very topics as well as the illegal wars abroad and the ever expanding surveillance state. People who are praising <em>Mueller</em>, the piece of shit who covered for 9/11, the IRA scandal, approved illegal searches, and many others. </p>

<p>But hey, call everyone who doesn&#39;t subscribe to your delusions t_d&#39;ers and Russian shills. You&#39;re unwittingly being the very useful idiot you accuse us of.</p>

<p>Literally all of the sources and journalists I listed are either largely non-partisan, libertarian, or left.</p>

<p>Still no evidence for this, but the billions of free publicity from the MSM + Cambridge Analytica helping him sure probably helped.</p>

<p>No, we don&#39;t. Lol what. The indictments are process crimes and financial corruption, which is, like I said, completely pervasive in the shadow government. Take Trump down, and they put in another proper crony. Solve nothing, but meanwhile you have a nice distraction from all of the policies I mentioned and the ability to smear anyone who goes against the Establishment a Russian troll.</p>

<p>It was utterly surreal the amount of fucking mind control the DNC and Hillary tried to spin.  I will say it has been effective, but in a terrible way. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I remember that being the exact opposite of what happened.  That might have been the case in some subs but in here people were fuming pissed.. Hillary&#39;s shitty tenure as Secretary of State was a regular topic in here even before we got so polarized, and saying that this sub is receptive to the idea of taking an &quot;anti-establishment&quot; dumb fuck over one who would rig a primary is an understatement.  In that short time before Brock&#39;s people showed up, most of the bernie people here were content on just watching the whole thing go up in flames.</p>

<p>Well shit, you basically arrived for the most obvious decline of the subreddit. This place used to ascertain a wide variety of theories with those disagreeing kindly bowing out of the discussion (rather than the present, where shills blatantly seem to agree with any and all conspiracies).</p>

<p>The other thing that&#39;s changed is the real-time nature of conspiracies. Now, shit is unfolding in real time rather than dissecting past ones (like 911 or the JFK assassination). This leads to a lot of sloppiness, confusion, disagreement, but is overall a wonderful thing. We get front row seats to watching the illusion crumble. It&#39;s probably part of the whole collapsing timeline/time acceleration issue. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh, time acceleration is an old theory that 2012 actually was the end of time, but not in the way we thought it to be. It&#39;s that time as a constricting barrier dissipates (ends), and as such, time seems to fly by. A lot of people have noticed this and have commented on it on subs like retconned. Collapsing timeline is the theory that quantum accelerators like CERN have wiped out various timelines and have merged everybody on the same timeline. This is why people experience &quot;glitches in the matrix,&quot; specifically, mandela effects: you&#39;ll sometimes hear others say, &quot;in my previous timeline, South America was directly under North America and not nearly so far east.&quot; The theory is that everyone is brought under one reality when previously there were many. This then requires reconciling the notion that many such multiverses exist in the first place.</p>

<p>Just a few of the more fun but radical conspiracy theories out there. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>2013 was a pretty big deal here, all around.  Aside from the Boston bombing thing, we had the death of Aaron Swartz, Snowden Leaks, Michael Hastings.. plus you had a world coming off of OWS and the Arab spring.  It was pretty clear then that the folks in charge needed to get a firm grip on the power of social media, but now.. After the election? Weather you think the results were good or bad, that did not go according to plan and now we&#39;ve now got every single political and capitalist agency, think tank, and organisation trying to figure out how to get complete control over what we say for good.  It&#39;s bad now, but I have a feeling its going to get astronomically worse in the next year or two.  TPTB don&#39;t like getting caught off guard, and it&#39;s happened way too much this past decade.</p>

<p>The sub exists to support the President.

<p>r/atheism, r/politics, r/music</p>

<p>Censored meaning, I can only post a comment every 8 minutes so having a conversation is annoying so the end result is, I don’t bother commenting on those subs anymore.</p>

<p>r/pics outright banned me.</p>

<p>My latest ban was on r/music on the post “Fyre Festival Promoter Billy McFarland Pleads Guilty to Fraud”</p>

<p>One of the top comments was about Trump and I basically said, “Why do you have to bring politics into a music post?”</p>

<p>I was immediately attacked and told that Trump is evil and has to be stopped. I was downvoted to shit and at least a half dozen SJW’ers attacked accusing me of being a Trumptard and a right winger (because I’m sick of hearing about Trump everywhere). </p>

<p>Then they checked my comment history and saw that I post in r/conspiracy so “No Wonder!”</p>

<p>Next thing you know, I’m censored.</p>

<p>They&#39;re not censoring you dumbass. Reddit has a feature where if you get down voted too much you can only post once every x minutes. Mods do not possess the power to enact that on people&#39;s accounts. And I went back and read your post and you&#39;re lying lol typical trump supporter</p>

<p>Here&#39;s the post in question.

<p>I don&#39;t know how to link directly to the comment but you can probably search for my username or check my history.</p>

<p>Again, another dumbass calling me a Trump supporter. Check my entire history. It&#39;s pretty clear I am not, nor have I ever posted in the Donald.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>To be fair, I think the Chans are partly so damn politically incorrect because it serves as a barrier to entry (which is exactly what they want). The alternative to less moderation is spam and shills, and I think they chose the tradeoff of political incorrectness. I genuinely wonder how many Chan&#39;ers are <em>actually</em> that racist, or if it&#39;s just the language used to prevent invasion.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I like steemit&#39;s functionality. Imagine a platform with a feel like Twitter, except it&#39;s based on a public blockchain so it cannot be censored like Twitter can be. It&#39;s also pretty unique in that upvotes directly equal cryptocurrency, so all the unpaid labor we do on other sites writing posts and curating actually gets monetarily rewarded there. Popular posts from people with a lot of followers can make hundreds of dollars worth of cryptocurrency. Seems like most upvotes are actually worth between $0.00 and $0.01 in USD, but because upvotes are weighted based on the user&#39;s investment in the currency, they can also be worth a lot more. The other day I left a comment that got up to being worth 35 dollars with just 5 votes, but I&#39;ve been trying it out for about a month and that&#39;s only happened once. Most of my comments have earned less than one cent&#39;s worth, with a handful of outliers in the dime to quarter range. Still, I really like the idea of people being paid for contributing to the social media network, especially the serious contributors who create content for the platform. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Look at the anti Alex Jones post on the top of this sub right now</p>

<p>I don&#39;t support Alex Jones. I know he&#39;s full of shit A LOT but he has opened millions of peoples minds to the idea that things aren&#39;t always as they appear. He&#39;s gotten millions of people to look into conspiracies that they otherwise would&#39;ve never known about. That&#39;s good enough for me, but the shills cant stand it because they hate how conspiracies usually go against their political ideology. </p>

<p>Yet this sub all of a sudden hates him and his conspiracies? Oh and COINCIDENTALLY this anti-Jones post shows up at the same time YouTube censors Alex Jones by demonetizing his videos.</p>

<p>Yeah. The shilling is too obvious.</p>

<p>post either has more upvotes than subscribers, or an extremely high upvote:subscriber ratio (typically well over 50%)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s the wisdom/stupidity of the commons. More regular people who don&#39;t know much are on the site and upvoting/downvoting without thinking/reading much. Shilling also works to an extent but it can only influence the crowd&#39;s decision (people upvote upvoted stuff and vice versa) and it&#39;s most effective in the early stages of the comment. The bots/shills can&#39;t outnumber the humans on this site because each effective bot/shill needs a unique IP address at the very least. It&#39;s just silly to assume (and we all do it) that it was all just bots downvoting and upvoting stuff. It was only regular visitors who may have been influenced by bots. There&#39;s no such thing as &quot;full of shills&quot;, it&#39;s just shills leading the blind and idiotic masses to vote the way they want.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Other users have already stated in this post that this sub changed pretty drastically during the 2016 election, I was here for that.</p>

<p>My question is, since I&#39;ve been here, right since just before the election, I&#39;ve noticed in other subs what looks like a tradition of dropping a slick one-liner and having a whole string of meta, six-degrees of Kevin bacon, play on words type jokes that follow and have very little to do with any sort of critical discussion even on serious topics. It seems like a great way to slide the conversation without putting forth any contentions that could be be proven wrong later or pissing anybody off with controversial comments.</p>

<p>Has it been like that forever in other subs?</p>

<p>Why doesn&#39;t it happen as much here?</p>

<p>It&#39;s a mix of bots and real but dipshit losers who want free karma and attention.  The hivemind here love to circlejerk everything to death but they all want to start the jerk and feel smart so there&#39;s a rush to the top of the jerk with the exact same comments.    That post before about that asian ladies face turning red had the same asian flushing syndrome replies over and over and they were still getting karma.  And this is common now people will rush to reply to the copy of that comment with a copy of highly upvoted comment that replied to it, in the same fucking thread.  Most of Reddit has become such mindless parroters that it&#39;s just fucking infuriating.  I mean it was bad enough when you knew exactly what would be at the top of a thread without even looking but now expect to see it multiple times.  It&#39;s a mix of bots and dumb asses, the bots control the narrative and the dumb asses gleefully parrot it everywhere.</p>

<p>Hardly anyone gives an honest opinion. Why? Upvotes.</p>

<p>Say something that&#39;s true and you can get a ton of upvotes. But only if your answer creates the right &quot;feel&quot; in the mind of the reader.</p>

<p>But the truth isn&#39;t always pleasant. Sometimes it&#39;s painful, even bitter. Telling that kind of truth is guaranteed to get you a ton of downvotes because bad feelings don&#39;t get karma.</p>

<p>One way of telling when you&#39;ve done this? A good sign is when you get 20 or 30 downvotes but no reply to your comment.</p>

<p>There&#39;s also lots of shills and bots. But the karma points system has a huge effect on actual human users. If you asked me why, I&#39;d say it&#39;s all the social conditioning. You see a number go up and subconsciously react to it like it was a game score or money. Numbers up = good and numbers down = bad.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Reddit has always projected many views onto it citizen. Look at the amount of Pro US Police forces propaganda.
Insult the relationship with the USA and Saudi Arabia and you&#39;ll be downvoted in every major sub.
Heck, you even get downvoted here if you disagree and think that maybe not all school shooting are manufactured by the government to enforce gun control.</p>

<p>People fundamentally want to read what they agree with, we get a dopamine hit when we disagree and we collectively are able to ignore and suppress dissenting views.
Not every conspiracy theory should be agreed with at all, 90% of the stuff in here could be debunked by a 12-year-old if only OP took a step back and realised their own cognitive biases.
Many real and proven conspiracies that are actionable RIGHT NOW are ignored for tales of pure fantasy about x group you don&#39;t like.</p>

<p>Well I can&#39;t speak for shills, which I&#39;m sure exist in all facets (both major political groups, corporate interests, advertisers, etc) but as for SJWs you&#39;re just going to have to accept that Reddit is predominately, if not by a supermajority, a liberal place.  They will vote with their perspective and that includes, in part, people who discovered reddit during the election, and people who have discovered subreddits they normally wouldn&#39;t have noticed or cared about.</p>
