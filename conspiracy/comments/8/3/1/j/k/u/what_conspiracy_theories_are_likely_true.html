    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, lets all start getting arrested in real life for being russian propaganda trolls for a start, wtf is a russian propaganda troll anyways, there has always been disinformation, why are we being told that we can only trust the main source now, I just find it strange, thats all. One of the next steps though, for sure will be stripping anonymity of what people post, because if your scared that you will be outcasted, hurt, shunned, ect for your thoughts, of course you would never say what you truly wanted to say. It is sad that we cant trust what is on the internet and what people say, but the internet has been like this for a decade now, not much has changed there. Why is everyone getting offended now, cant even talk about the real shit plaguing us, without sounding crazy or hurting someone&#39;s feelings.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>As someone who works in Pharmacology, anti-depressants in general should only be used for extreme depression, the kind that leaves people crippled and curled up in a ball for days.

<p>Ketamine has been strongly suggested to reduce symptoms of depression within hours of a single dose and can last up to a week or more (<a href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT00088699">https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT00088699</a>).</p>

<p>I&#39;ve struggled through 4 different anti-depressants, 2 tranquilizer drugs, and seen 5 different CBT counselors with little to no effect on my mental health, but this drug is really a lifesaver.</p>

<p>If you are in the US I strongly recommend you look for a clinical study near you!</p>

<p>Yeah, those pics were pretty mind-blowing. Though, perhaps it was caused by the pyroclastic-like flows from the towers collapses? Maybe the heat from the TONS of thermite involved? Regardless, I think Building 7 is the smoking-gun of 9/11. Once you understand building 7, everything just starts branching out from there.</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermite">Thermite burns at appoximately 2500 degrees Celsius</a>.  Let&#39;s just forget the logistics of being able to load up the main structural supports of both towers and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermite#Ignition">the fact that Thermite use is notoriously unpredictable</a>.  We&#39;ll just assume that <em>someone</em> was able to place enough Thermite on each support and managed to light them all at once.</p>

<p>The end result would be an immense, uncontrollable fire at the base of the towers.  The asphalt streets in the immediate vicinity would melt and those unfortunate to be standing at the base of the towers would have burned to death.  The resulting fire from such an event would have been obvious to everyone watching that day, which would include news agencies from around the world and countless private citizens.</p>

<p>Seriously... The thermite theory is one of the most foolish I have heard in relation to the (alleged) 9/11 conspiracy.</p>

<p>[Thermite is a pyrotechnic composition of metal powder, which serves as fuel, and metal oxide. When ignited by heat, thermite undergoes an exothermic reduction-oxidation (redox) reaction. Most varieties are not explosive, but can create brief bursts of heat and high temperature in a small area. Its form of action is similar to that of other fuel-oxidizer mixtures, such as black powder.</p>

<p>Thermites have diverse compositions. Fuels include aluminium, magnesium, titanium, zinc, silicon, and boron. Aluminium is common because of its high boiling point and low cost. Oxidizers include bismuth(III) oxide, boron(III) oxide, silicon(IV) oxide, chromium(III) oxide, manganese(IV) oxide, iron(III) oxide, iron(II,III) oxide, copper(II) oxide, and lead(II,IV) oxide.](<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermite">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermite</a>)</p>

<p>Not sure where &quot;nano-particles&quot; factor into it.  Thermite is made from very common metals.</p>

<p>Why yes, he is is John Le Bon&#39;s, aka &quot;the world&#39;s leading skeptic&quot;, # 1 fan because he is likely John Le Bon and he comes here to spam this reddit with links to his subscriber based (20$+/mo) website and to videos that advertise his 20$+/mo website. He claims to have 50 followers, so that puts him in the 12K annually territory but he wants more.</p>

<p>So he is here to sell you his wisdom. Does he have evidence for any of this? The little free material he provides that is not pure snark and derision, that does explain his theories is usually very low on evidence and when their is evidence it usually based in not understanding basic science or research principles. </p>

<p>“Their father brought the boys in and I remembered seeing them taken into a side room where bright lights were on. &quot;They all had to drop their pants and before their performance a big man raped each one of them in a lineup.&quot; - Brice Taylor</p>

<p>His father arranged for Michael to be used by older men.  Jermaine stated that his father had Michael join late-night hotel room meetings with &quot;important business people.&quot; </p>

<p>Jermaine always wondered whether &quot;something happened&quot; to Michael at those sessions.  He said he sensed something was wrong because Michael would be sick for days after these meetings. Likely once again obviously hinting at rape or sexual acts.</p>

<p>Vegas October 1 2017 was definitely a set up. </p>

<p>But ummm my theory is that the bible was dictated by an alien race that was ruling over that part of the world at the time. The old testament and the new testament being different races of aliens, which helps to explain the stark differences in the rule of God in those scripts. The short grays were ruling BC but then the ancients discovered them doing that, ran them off, and made a new book. </p>

<p>What do you think of that one?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I mean there is 17, but I don&#39;t buy into the reptilians idea. Who would that be, the God of Islam? Nah I&#39;ve read that book too, I don&#39;t think aliens had anything to do with that one. Plus I don&#39;t think that the reptile design is meant to evolve into intelligence, because intelligence is a result of having a weak body. Which reptiles are insanely strong. </p>

<p>I suppose there could be a race from a harsh world that ended up having scaly skin but slitted eyes doesn&#39;t make much sense because slitted eyes is a hunting trait that would have been fazed out over time. </p>

<p>What race were you talking about anyway?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Interesting theory but when I read the Bible it doesn&#39;t matter to me if it&#39;s the OT or the NT it definitely feels like it originated from the same source despite being written by dozens of writers over a few thousand years. What I&#39;m trying to say I guess is that if it was an alien race or something then it would just be one, not two. </p>

<p>When did humanity discover this was happening and how did they run these aliens out of town?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Real quick I  just want to bitch, I can&#39;t believe I get down voted for saying conspiracy theories in this sub. I fucking miss this sub pre 2016. </p>

<p>Anywho... really you find them to be the same-ish God(lord). Because the OT was very involved. Doing plagues and floods and shaking the earth type stuff. Where the NT God was a lot less involved. More just talking to people. Also the way punishment is talked about. OT was real heavy where the NT was more like it&#39;s a bad idea. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t know, I&#39;m not a Scripture Mastery guy. Why do you think they are the same?</p>

<p>As for your question, earthlings didn&#39;t have anything to do with it. In my understanding the second race had a lighter touch and backed off. Or in your understand it would be more like as we became move advanced they had to be more secretive but they are still very much in control.</p>

<p>What do you think?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think the reason the God of the OT was more involved is because He had to make sure the Messiah was born. The world was probably a freaking crazy place back then. That&#39;s what the entire Bible is about. The story of two people, Adam and Eve and through them the tribes of Israel, king David, etc. all the way down to Jesus Christ. It&#39;s not meant as an entirely encompassing work of everything that was happening everywhere like some criticize it for.</p>

<p>The reason I said that I believe it was inspired by the same being is more based on the feeling I get when reading scripture. It says in the book of Timothy I believe that all scripture, including the NT is inspired by God. </p>

<p>I&#39;m a Christian but I certainly come at it from a different perspective than a lot of people. It&#39;s obvious there is something insane going on in this reality and that it&#39;s being caused by entities, fallen angels, archons, aliens...take your pick of what you wish to call them. The Bible is polluted with all kinds of crazy things that a lot of people just gloss over or don&#39;t understand that there are multiple levels and meanings in the same scriptures. </p>

<p>I wish I could write more I realize I may not have even fully answered one of your questions. I hate typing on my phone so I apologize if this post doesn&#39;t make a lot of sense. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well I certainly don&#39;t mind running into a Christian. I really admire the people of Christ. A lot more after I learned about post-modernism, or in other words, what happens when people don&#39;t have a belief system. Friedrich Nietzsche famously said &quot;God is dead&quot; which is often misquoted to mean God isn&#39;t real. Yet what he was saying is that society is dead without God. I&#39;ll come back to this. </p>

<p>Sorry you don&#39;t like using a touch screen. Soon enough we will just think into our phones. (As if it&#39;s a phone anymore) yeah I love Jesus. Weather he was real or not. The story of Jesus is of the best man to ever live.</p>

<p>Interestingly I have studied Mormonism as well. Nice people, most people don&#39;t know they are Christian. Just have a newer book. Their Mormon God is like the OT one but even angrier. But don&#39;t stop by a church, they believe in 3 heavens and that they can become gods and that God, the Holy Spirit, and Jesus are different beings. </p>

<p>Where was I going with this comment. I don&#39;t remember. But hey check out Dr Jordan B Peterson&#39;s interpretation of the biblical stories. <a href="https://youtu.be/hdrLQ7DpiWs">https://youtu.be/hdrLQ7DpiWs</a> he might give you a new look on everything.</p>

<p>I&#39;ll try to gather my thoughts and give a better reply later. Cheers mate.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yea, there is so much coded in the bible.... as well as most religious texts really. The parallels and common symbols that people have found in various religions around the world is very interesting. And in the esoteric stuff, you can decode all kinds of science and math in things like the bible that describe biology with reproduction, dna replication, human anatomy.... as well as ties to astronomy and the planets. Some of it is pretty advanced too, that requires current tech. </p>

<p>It is layered with knowledge coded in there.... it really does seem like someone hid this knowledge in various religious texts for a reason but not sure why. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>There is certainly a difference in tone with OT and NT.... I dunno bout same god or different, but the catholics back then were big on punishment so while the books might have had a lighter tone, their practice didn&#39;t. </p>

<p>The OT was more similar to other religions at the time with more involved stories, like greek/roman, hindu, pagan, mayan. They had more involved rituals and worship.. even a pretty in depth mystical practice. People have found parallels with those religions and similar symbols or archetypes.  Supposedly there was a big astronomical event that happened back then too, maybe a planet got too close or something, which is why religions around the world used same symbols or described events.... and the gravitational disturbance may have caused disasters or the flood which is why those religions had a more serious tone at times. </p>

<p>It&#39;s clearly written by a pissed off war Lord to inspire his troops into sacrificing their lives in a war against the world. Also the only miracle mentioned in their is that Muhammad &quot;flew on a donkey&quot;. Plus the only person who ever talked to that God was Muhammad.

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re getting a lot of flak here for a few reasons man. One, the way your looking at &#39;conspiracy theories&#39; is like trading cards. So are true some aren&#39;t, but it&#39;s fun either way. The notion of a conspiracy is that something isn&#39;t right and you should ask questions and do research for yourself to determine if that is the case. Asking people which ones are true is kind of missing the point. These aren&#39;t TV episodes, it&#39;s the world you live in. You&#39;ve really got to look into things for yourself. If you feel something isn&#39;t right, research it. Multiple sources and perspectives and see which ones add up more or less than the others. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>OK, no offence meant man. Different subcultures have different perspectives :).</p>

<p>In my opinion most conspiracies once you did into them enough all reach the same conclusion, that there is a group of wealthy elites who have subverted our entire civilisation for their own adgendas. But I guess if you want individual ones, have a look at the sidebar link they people have suggested.</p>

<p>Anyway have a good day man :). The grand conspiracy is them trying to turn us all against one another so we just perpetrate the cycle of being dicks to each other thinking that&#39;s just human nature. It&#39;s not, we&#39;re all one and we&#39;re all in it together. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>There is a conspiracy by government workers using through the wall radar to spy on everyone.  In 2010 a graduate text was published on the subject of through the wall radar imaging, this is available to anyone to purchase, and since it is public it likely was not state of the art when it was written.<br/>
The system could be mostly passive.  That is there are few transmission antennas directly connected to the radar surveillance system.  All transmissions of sub optical light, radar, microwave, radio could be used by receiving antennas to provide input to signal processing systems.  This is easier and cheaper than installing cctv surveillance systems everywhere.  With computation modeling it would only flag a human worker when something of interest occurred.  With continuous improvement in the software used in signal processing, and in equipment, they likely can see and track a mosquito.</p>

<p>Maybe it started in London on Guy Fawkes day in 1984.  It would suit the sense of humor of the bureaucrats doing this to do have done this on that day.  I think it has been going on for about 25 years.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>How can a radar system be passive when you need a propagated signal to receive? What size signal/magnetron does it use? I assume it would need to be millimetric at the most, but range would be an issue.</p>

<p>Does it solely rely on passively detecting wireless and LTE emissions? If so, it’s not radar.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The radar systems have to have transmission antennas to &#39;calibrate&#39; the signals received from all the other sources of electromagnetic radiation.   These sources would be the bulk of &#39;progagated signals&#39;.</p>

<p>So no it is not solely based on passive detection of em waves.  Even though you say a solely based Rectenna system is not radar, I would argue that it still is radio wave detection and ranging.  I read that German radar in the second world war used the British radar transmission signals.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Elements inside the US government and/or military industrial complex carried out the 2001 anthrax letter attacks that killed 5 Americans and injured 17, while terrifying the nation that a weapon of mass destruction could be moving through the mail, to drum up support for the &quot;Global War on Terror&quot; and sweeping surveillance powers.</p>

<p>First there was an apparent campaign to blame Iraq for providing Al Qaeda terrorists with the anthrax. John McCain <a href="https://youtu.be/jMiDXoYJbN4">blamed them on David Letterman</a>. ABC News ran <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/US/story?id=92270&amp;amp;page=1">false news stories</a> from &quot;well-placed and separate&quot; anonymous sources about Saddam&#39;s signature &quot;bentonite&quot; additive and 9/11 hijacker leader Mohamed Atta meeting with Iraqi intelligence in Prague. </p>

<p>Both stories were later proven false. In what Glenn Greenwald has called <a href="https://www.salon.com/2008/08/01/anthrax_2/">&quot;the single greatest, unresolved media scandal of this decade,&quot;</a> ABC News refused to give up its sources. Tests showed the anthrax <a href="https://www.salon.com/2008/08/01/anthrax_2/">never had any bentonite</a> and actually came from US bioweapons labs. So the FBI targeted bioweapons worker Steven Hatfill as a &quot;person of interest.&quot; </p>

<p>Hatfill was harassed with 24-hour surveillance for months, including digging through his garbage, tapping his phones, questioning his friends, public humiliation throughout the media smearing him as a murderer, and harassment by local police. These &quot;bumper locking&quot; tactics drove him to drink. Hatfill took the case to court. The judge found <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2010/05/the-wrong-man/308019/">&quot;not a scintilla of evidence that would indicate that Dr. Hatfill had anything to do with&quot; the anthrax attacks</a>. Attorney General John Ashcroft gave a deposition on camera, answering &quot;I don&#39;t know&quot; to 85 questions. The Justice Department settled, awarding Hatfill $5.82 million dollars. </p>

<p>Then they publicly targeted Bruce Ivins, who &quot;committed suicide&quot; via Tylenol overdose before he could be charged. Obama came into office and closed the case. They had no evidence against Ivins anyways, though they pretend like the case was solved. </p>

<p>Glenn Greenwald: </p>

<blockquote>
<p>President Obama -- in what I think is one his most indefensible acts -- actually threatened to veto the entire intelligence authorization bill if it included a proposed bipartisan amendment (passed by the House) that would have mandated an independent inquiry into the FBI&#39;s anthrax investigation...</p>

<p>Indeed, the veto threat issued by the Obama White House was refreshingly (albeit unintentionally) candid about why it was so eager to block any independent inquiry: &quot;The commencement of a fresh investigation would undermine public confidence in the criminal investigation and unfairly cast doubt on its conclusions.&quot;  That would happen only if the FBI&#39;s claims could not withstanding independent, critical scrutiny.  But -- as is even more apparent now than ever -- the White House is fully aware that it cannot.  In a rational, non-corrupt environment, that would be a reason to insist upon -- not take extraordinary steps to block -- an independent investigation into one of the most consequential crimes ever committed on U.S. soil.  But that, manifestly, is not the world in which we live, and thus -- despite continuously mounting evidence that we do not know anywhere close to the full story of who perpetrated this attack -- the country&#39;s political leadership continues to stonewall any efforts to find out.</p>

<p>Also, 3 months before the anthrax attacks there was a bioterror drill called Operation Dark Winter that simulated a large-scale bioweapons attack on the US. The <a href="http://www.centerforhealthsecurity.org/our-work/events/2001_dark-winter/Dark%20Winter%20Script.pdf">script</a> mentioned letters being sent to media (just like the real attacks) and a threat of using anthrax (see the last page). In it, former CIA Director James Woolsey plays the CIA Director. He was a member of the Project For a New American Century neocon thinktank, famous for their paper <a href="http://www.informationclearinghouse.info/pdf/RebuildingAmericasDefenses.pdf">Rebuilding America&#39;s Defenses</a> that laid out big plans for increases in surveillance and a &quot;core mission&quot; to &quot;fight and decisively win multiple, simultaneous major theater wars,&quot; but worried their ambitions plans might take a while because &quot;the process of transformation, even if it brings revolutionary change, is likely to be a long one, absent some catastrophic and catalyzing event – like a new Pearl Harbor.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The government suppresses advanced tech for public use because of how powerful it is. They have to ensure that police forces are equipped to deal with all the potential scenarios as well as monitoring equipment training etc to be able to handle criminal situations involving advanced technology. ie Imagine if smart phones/wifi were widespread in the 90s do you think the police would have the where with all to deal with the cyber crimes or hackers if they had access to that type of technology. The world would be an utter shit show if technology was not delayed for those reasons as it would be like giving a chimp a machine gun while they were still inventing the bullet proof vest. </p>

<p>Just imagine what future age technology the CIA and other global intelligence communities are testing now and their methods of use/controling them to ensure that public safety is ensured while allowing them to maintain control/order. 
Think of VR programs, prosthetic limbs controlled by thought google glass and imagine that infinitely more complex/sophisticated devices, programs, methods and anything you can think of are actively being tested but hidden from the public for security reasons. 
Some of the shit being tested by the intelligence agencies would appear to be utterly like magic or alien technology because of how advanced in seemingly being like technology from the future if you were told what it actually was.</p>

Russia found this out I in 2015 and used Israel&#39;s hack too. They then blackmailed republicans to drop sanctions and be more friendly to Russia in the global market and resource wars. Its all blamed on russia when it really was Israel and Russia. Trump and republicans are in deals with Russia Israel so deep its fucking up every echelons normal so these wealthy members are attacking trump and Russia to restore their financial networks they rule.

He claims to have 50 followers, so that puts him in the 12K annually territory but he wants more.</p>

<p>So he is here to sell you his wisdom. Does he have evidence for any of this? The little free material he provides that is not pure snark and derision, that does explain his theories is usually very low on evidence and when their is evidence it usually based in not understanding basic science or research principles. </p>

<p>Check his post and comment history... he used to post in crypto sub reddits before he got banned...</p>

<p><a href="https://vigilantcitizen.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/chinese-mike%0Ae1415639931451.jpg">This image is MKULTRA 101. It is all about the concept of duality and the split of personality. From the umbrellas facing in opposite ways, to the mirroring faces displaying opposite emotions and the checkerboard pattern at the bottom, it is one of the clearest clues hinting to MJ being subjected to mind control. Also, parts of his body appear “tacked on”, which is how MK slaves are programmed to feel.</a></p>

<p>“Their father brought the boys in and I remembered seeing them taken into a side room where bright lights were on. &quot;They all had to drop their pants and before their performance a big man raped each one of them in a lineup.&quot; - Brice Taylor</p>

<p>His father arranged for Michael to be used by older men.  Jermaine stated that his father had Michael join late-night hotel room meetings with &quot;important business people.&quot; </p>

<p>Jermaine always wondered whether &quot;something happened&quot; to Michael at those sessions.  He said he sensed something was wrong because Michael would be sick for days after these meetings. Likely once again obviously hinting at rape or sexual acts.</p>

<p>I&#39;m pointing out that the OP likely started this thread in the hope that someone would mention the so called holocaust, upon which the OP (not me) could then make assertations the entirety of <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> was anti jew - hence why I pointed out the OP&#39;s (not mine) rant elsewhere in the discussion.</p>
