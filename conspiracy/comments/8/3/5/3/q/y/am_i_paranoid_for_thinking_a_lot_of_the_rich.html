<p>Too many of them have occult symbolism tattooed on their skin. They use occult symbolism in their music, films and all other forms of media.</p>

<p>So many celebrities can’t all be coincidentally using occult symbolism in their work at once. They’re obviously apart of something. I can’t put my finger on it but I get the feeling they have a plan and are working up to something with the way they’re able to manipulate the general public’s behavior and attitudes/morals.</p>

<p>Lol am I being paranoid?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The way I see it, some people in power positions may be involved in occult activity, while the rich and famous and even some creative directors themselves might have just happened to become accepted into their positions due to sharing similar aesthetic but are not necessarily a part of any occult society.</p>

<p>As per what might it be that they are working towards?  Well, here I will turn on my spiritual thinking cap and say: they are spreading the spiritual and thought entities that they worship.  Art is a powerful medium for transmitting and giving life to entities which only exist in the realm of emotion, thought, and spirit.  As per whether the entities the mainstream spreads are negative or not - often but not always ;)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The rich and famous are not in control. The rich and powerful are in control, and we don&#39;t know exactly who they are.</p>

<p>It would be nice if you were more specific as to what you mean by occult.</p>

<p>In any case.</p>

<p>Any activity you see the rich and famous do, boils down to public relations campaigns for the rich and powerful, directed at the general public. Over all, the message is building acceptance towards the false idea that individuals have no power. Mental and psychological colonization, same as ever. Just one of many themes used to get attention of certain individuals and corral them.</p>

<p>Not paranoid. More like being afraid of shadows, even though the body is the thing that&#39;s dangerous.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s how casting couch pornos came about, it wasn&#39;t just pulled from thin air, there is some truth behind it.</p>

<p>Why do 90% of celebrities have no problem doing sex/nude scenes.</p>

<p>Don&#39;t forget a lot of celebrities are former pornstars</p>

<p>Gay Hip-Hop mafia</p>

<p>Spirit Cooking</p>

<p>Fucking Harvey Weinstein</p>

<p>Televised toddler beauty pageants</p>

<p>Occult symbolism in music videos (sounds like stupid 2007 YouTube illuminati videos, but anybody that knows art (fine arts, music, film, theatre, DIRECTING) knows that everything is strategically put in the screen for a reason. Whether it be advertising, setting the mood, foreshadowing etc. Im not saying they are trying to subliminally make you stupid, (that&#39;s the job of the artist and their music). It&#39;s simple homage to the occult. Some sell their soul.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not implying that. I know plenty of smart people who are religious. But they aren&#39;t elite in any way. </p>

<p>We can agree that the most powerful people in the world have access to knowledge that we know nothing about, especially as far as the major religions go. They&#39;ve had this knowledge for a couple of thousand years? 1500 at least? So they are certain about the existence of any of the thousands of available gods. With this knowledge, only one of two things can be true:</p>

<ol>
<li>They know which gods are real and are attempting to, what, gain enough power to destroy this all powerful, all knowing deity? </li>
</ol>

<p>Or</p>

<ol>
<li>They know that religion is bullshit and are trying to gather as much wealth and power as possible.</li>
</ol>

    <div class="md"><p>I think this &quot;occult symbolism&quot; stuff is way overblown.... </p>

<p>Ask yourself this. If you had your own company and had do design your own logo, how would it look? Now pick it apart and see if you can tie it to occult symbolism. If you made a generic scifi/action flick, what would the plot be? Pick it apart, see if you could find symbolism in it. </p>

<p>Anyone with some decent artistic talent would use the exact same imagery or themes. I&#39;m sure my logo would have triangles or nice geometry. I&#39;ve studied all that esoteric stuff so I&#39;m sure it would show up if I had to write or design something. Much of this occult symbolism on its own isn&#39;t evil at all, its normal stuff that is in almost everything... that&#39;s why its tied to kant&#39;s collective unconscious. The symbolism is like bare bones stuff. </p>

<p>Its the INTENT you gotta look at, and without knowing more about who is behind it, we can&#39;t say for sure. I&#39;ve thought about this too regarding musicians... we forget a lot of these stars once they have &quot;made it&quot; basically just show up and sing while other people manage their look, they got different directors doing their music videos and picking the themes for them. I&#39;d blame the gay mafia designers before the musicians in trying to use occult imagery lol. </p>

<p>All that said tho.... I&#39;m sure politics and government is dirty. Gov&#39;t, police/military, wall street/bankers. That is where the money and power is, where secrecy is needed and where blackmailing is worth it. Then throw in some greasy Hollywood execs. So the rich in those areas might be involved in occult stuff. But I wouldn&#39;t say everyone who is super rich is as corrupt or mixed up as those people. I&#39;m sure a lot are just typical drugged up, egotistical types without the murder and sex trade. Its hard to gain perspective tho, cause I keep thinking how the hell they have time and energy to do this stuff or how anyone can be that horny at their age.... but I suppose if your rich you would have a lot more free time on your hands (and secret youth serums if you believe all the tales). </p>

<p>I dunno... I was a lot more paranoid before and had some wild ideas about wide scale conspiracies, a whole hidden narrative for what was really going on. I still think some of it is true but not as much as before. Had to stop watching so many youtube videos... they get you hyped expecting &quot;The Purge&quot; any day lol. Was too much fear mongering and theories, so I chilled out for a bit.... esp cause none of my friends would bother to read or watch non-MSM news so had no idea about the stuff I&#39;d talk about. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not sure what the obsession is with conspiracies and the occult. The extremely powerful must understand that religion is fake and use it to control the masses. So being involved in a more outrageous form of religion seems extremely unlikely.</p>

<p>I never understood the connection. It&#39;s more likely that religious people would associate the evil their religion teaches with the people they consider to be evil. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you have to ask r/conspiracy if you are paranoid, I think you may be a little paranoid.</p>

<p>What can people do with occult activity that they can&#39;t accomplish with just shit loads of cash?</p>

<p>People have accused celebrities of making pacts with the Devil since Paganini.</p>

<p>I mean, if someone was truly all powerful, why would they need to exert control? Surely their power would always guarantee their power. Especially if it was granted to them by an extra planar entity. </p>

<p>And there is a disconnect of Church&#39;s are corrupt and only exist to extort money, to the all powerful of society are secret devil worshippers with a secret religion. I think you could dig into this for the next 100 years and with the dawn of the Internet and just more and more information being created every year, after a century of trying to prove this for certainty you aloud be nowhere closer than you are now. </p>

<p>If you distrust celebrities now? What can they do to prove to you that they are telling the truth other than telling you exactly what you would like to hear? And wouldn&#39;t that in itself be suspicious? </p>

<p>AI has not got this subconsious and natural link to One and therefor it can&#39;t be a natural co-creator of this reality.

<p>But just because an organism makes something, doesn&#39;t necessarily mean that something is unnatural.  This includes pollution.  This isn&#39;t the case for anything else in nature.

    <div class="md"><p>No. Its a club and its devilish. Not all but alto are. Watch the video for Love My Way by Psychedelic Furs around 0:49 that&#39;s who people talk about. The verse talks about them. Its devil/Satan worshipers. They use technology to digitally map people and their brains/nervous system on an atomic level. They map pleasure mostly but can use pain as well. Say you break your ankle, if its mapped they canbuse that pain in you, and others, believe itbor not. For the &quot;good followers&quot; or whatever they get ultimate happinessband gregariousness, which is mapped from other people. The &quot;bad guys&quot; lose their soul (mapped out of the brain or &quot;chakras&quot; to makebthem completely numb.) </p>

<p>How do i know thus? They do it to me. They have smells mapped from when I was like 8 years old. I didn&#39;t succeed in becoming a singer so they just shit on me now. Change my body, halt happiness, halt sexual gratification, increase anxiety around people causing me to be very shy etc... Its 100% real.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>Could it be Tesla and Einstein were correct, are we all Energy?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Well, theories after Einstein - what is called particle physics, or - dare I say it &quot;quantum physics&quot; (mechanics). I am hesitant to use that because so mean people use it to try and make their rubbish sound scientific.</p>

<p>Anyway - I believe things at a quantum particle level exist as both waves and particles.. Waves been what we more classically use to describe energy. But all mass has a direct relationship (and ability of conversion) with Energy. You are correct in Einstein&#39;s famous principle of E = mc<sup>2</sup></p>

<p>Which is the relationship of Mass and Energy (and of course the speed of light). So yes - anything that has Mass, also has energy. Or, perhaps more importantly to your point - can be described in terms of energy.</p>

<p>So in a sense, Mass and Energy become interchangeable.</p>

<p>And quantum physics (just very small things, nothing magic - seriously) has more or less demonstrated this even clearer - that said, there&#39;s notorious issues with gravity (in relativity and special relativity) when it&#39;s being measured at a quantum scale. The theories don&#39;t quite mesh. So we&#39;re missing a bit.</p>

<p>So umm.. yeah - absolutely we are all &quot;energy&quot; - however, that said - I somehow don&#39;t think that means whatever the hell you think it means.. which I suspect is something &quot;magic&quot; because I&#39;m guessing you didn&#39;t take physics?</p>
