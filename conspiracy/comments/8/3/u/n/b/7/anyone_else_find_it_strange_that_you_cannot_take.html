With my old phones, with removable batteries, if I turned if off at %50 when I turned it back on it was still at %50. New phone, Samsung 7s, loses up to %15 battery life while &quot;completely off&quot;. So clearly the phone is working hard while off.....</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Most of the silicon valley morons who use Apple Foxconn shit are neither intelligent or rich. A hipster who can do a bit of coding and is a tiny cog in a gigantic machine is unlikely to be &quot;rich&quot; or very worldly, and last time i checked you dont need a computer science degree to work at a silicon valley company. To be high up the food chain, sure there are smart people up there, but most are not high on the food chain.</p>

<p>And actually, yes a lot of coders and people who do nothing but software know very little about hardware or the design and engineering of semiconductors or more broadly of computer hardware.</p>

<p>If you were talking about people working in the fields of HPC, EDA, for a company like Synopsys or Applied Materials they would typically much more well versed in hardware, because a co-design approach between the hardware and software is essential to get useful work done with your $200 million new supercomputer or billion dollar fab.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Nah, just recently apps on the iOS store were allowed to go to 64 bit, which can only work on iOS 10+. iPhones bought before September 2016 would have iOS 9, which isn’t supported with 64 bit apps. One app for example is the Dunkin’ Donuts app, which stopped support for 32 bit versions and wouldn’t work unless you upgraded to iOS 11 (Apple stopped allowing updates to iOS 10 at that point). Just one example where what you said isn’t necessarily the case. </p>

<p>but this means getting relatively close to the device, if you don&#39;t take the battery off then is easier.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I dont think that is what started it, but I think it has potentially become a convenient use in applications where &quot;offline&quot; snooping is actually happening. its a lot more likely that OEMs originally started doing this in the interest of frequent device replacement. People used to have phones for a few years at a time at least, now they are almost disposable (even though the prices have become absurd). The battery is the one piece of hardware in a mobile device that has a high likelihood of failing in the short term. CPUs, memory, even the display are all capable of operating for quite some time (without physical damage). So you want to make sure people arent holding on to phones for years at a time, make it so they dont work anymore. </p>

<p>I personally do not believe that all phones that don&#39;t have removable batteries are offline snooping on people. I believe the technology is certainly possible, and likely applied in certain situations but I do not believe this is the &quot;reason&quot; most phones have non removable batteries these days. </p>

<p>Remember OEM manufacturers are not Google or Apple of the US Government. I am sure they are lobbied to do things in certain ways, but first and foremost they are looking to make a buck. Information companies are the ones to be afraid of (for the most part). </p>

<p>The iphone 8 and X share the same IP67 rating.</p>

<p>&quot;The Galaxy S8 and S8+ feature IP68-rated water and dust resistance. The IP68 rating indicates that the Galaxy S8 and S8+ is water resistant up to 1.5 meters (4.92 feet) for 30 minutes&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah sure, you know better based on anecdotal evidence of 3 year old+ phones coming in with damage. You have the factors of wear and tear, drop damage and user error (not snapping the cover on completely) leaving the seals less than waterproof. These factors can lead to sealed devices having compromised water proofing, although epoxies hold better than plastic joints and silicone gaskets. But whats better, a dead phone thats waterproof and epoxied shut, or one that just needs a $30 new battery and rear cover?</p>

<p>This trend leads to more heavy metals and toxic waste in the landfills. Plus steady, predictable profits for cell phone manufacturers. </p>

If you buy an oem battery and install it with the same adhesive strips they use (which you can buy from sellers online), and if applicable to the generation of phone, reapply the waterproof gasket which you can also buy online, they have no way of knowing it wasnt replaced by a certified tech.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Most of the silicon valley morons who use Apple Foxconn shit are neither intelligent or rich. A hipster who can do a bit of coding and is a tiny cog in a gigantic machine is unlikely to be &quot;rich&quot; or very worldly, and last time i checked you dont need a computer science degree to work at a silicon valley company. To be high up the food chain, sure there are smart people up there, but most are not high on the food chain.</p>

<p>And actually, yes a lot of coders and people who do nothing but software know very little about hardware or the design and engineering of semiconductors or more broadly of computer hardware.</p>

<p>If you were talking about people working in the fields of HPC, EDA, for a company like Synopsys or Applied Materials they would typically much more well versed in hardware, because a co-design approach between the hardware and software is essential to get useful work done with your $200 million new supercomputer or billion dollar fab.</p>
