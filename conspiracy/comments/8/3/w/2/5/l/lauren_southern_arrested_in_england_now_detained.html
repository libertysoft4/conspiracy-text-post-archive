<p>Fucksakes. Big busts are happening all over the world all the time - paedophilia is a menace in every country. Big busts happen here, too, and too regularly. People really need to stop fucking raping children. </p>

<p>The globalists are everywhere, too. Have you not noticed that you have a president who claims to want to drain the swamp and then fills his cabinet with oil executives and globalists? He wants to imitate some of the worst dictators in contemporary history and people applaud that. You think that your country is immune from the Rothschilds? That&#39;s, ahh, cute... </p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, that is a bit of a stretch by the other guy. But i have seen, over the years, Muslim protests about attacking England (which is fine, it&#39;s a free speech law and i respect their right to practice free speech) but, i have seen other marches get shut-down and any &#39;far-right&#39; speech get immediately punished. Be it work, school, on the streets etc.</p>

<p>There is no question that our police force and government attack far-right groups more than they do relilgious hate-speech. </p>

<p>The biggest tragedy is that the Indians (Sikhs) hate the Muslims more than any other culture, yet they are branded racist for speaking out against them</p>

<p>In case that was too quick or confusing I&#39;ll say it again. The government made the citizens fear, a force which could exist anywhere and in the mind of any man, woman or child. Then the citizens told the government to go use force against those people, not realizing &quot;those people&quot; was themselves.</p>

<p>Then the government did just that, and the new Dark Ages has begun. Don&#39;t lose hope. Free minds will walk in the light again. Remember those who worked to show you the light. </p>

<p>Bukhari (52:256) - The Prophet... was asked whether it was permissible to attack the pagan warriors at night with the probability of exposing their women and children to danger. The Prophet replied, &quot;They (i.e. women and children) are from them (i.e. pagans).&quot; In this command, Muhammad establishes that it is permissible to kill non-combatants in the process of killing a perceived enemy. This provides justification for the many Islamic terror bombings.﻿ </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Culture differences boil down to geographic isolation over long time periods. Race was created in the same way, but its not as rigid. For example a white person born and raised in south Africa does not necessarily share any cultural similarities to a white person born in Pennsylvania. In other words a person can look outwardly a certain way, but a better categorization for that person than race would be culture. That is why I take issue with the people crying &quot;racist&quot; over things that really come down to cultural differences. There are very few people in this world who are dumb enough to still buy into the idea of genetic superiority. On the other hand I would ague that most people subscribe to some form of cultural superiority. I think this is unavoidable and the only solution is to tolerate a difference of opinion and utilize a free exchange of ideas. That&#39;s why I don&#39;t like people who want to silence others.            </p>

    <div class="md"><p>environment dictates your culture and no matter your appearance you will have a cultural identity first and foremost (your appearance may also impact your cultural identity depending on your location). You can say that African Americans had their culture taken away and in some respects that is true, but that is also denying African Americans their own unique culture that exists today as a subset of a broader American culture and that is a subset of an even more expansive western culture. It seems like you chose to see the world as nothing but a system of hierarchies enforced by systematic oppression perpetrated by white people (correct me if I am wrong in that assumption). I think that is not really a clear picture of things but I can see how you&#39;d come to that conclusion since its kind of the prevailing viewpoint for a number of people. Maybe try thinking outside of a race centric world view for a while and see if you can think of any other possibilities.    </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not alt right. </p>

<p>Before your ninja edit you said &quot;the alt right talks about ancient Greece all the time&quot;, so you added &quot;western society&quot; cause I think you realize that they actually don&#39;t talk about ancient Greece all the time. That&#39;s the whole reason I commented. I studied ancient Greece quite a bit in college and have even done a summer in Greece excavating.</p>

<p>If anything, I was thrown by that comment because you rarely see discussion on ancient Greece. It occurs on this sub probably more so than others due to its connection to some of hidden history conspiracies as well as a fantastic historical mystery; the collapse of the bronze age.</p>

<p>When I Google &quot;alt right ancient greece&quot;, I get two articles saying bannon likes Thucydides, therefore thebhistorybof ancient Greece is bad. What the fuck is that shit?</p>

<p>GQ actually lambasted Thucydides as a &quot;dry scribe&quot; who &quot;hits on themes such as the clash of civilizations and realpolitik amorality that naturally appeal to a dermatological nightmare like Bannon&quot;. Fuck that anti intellectual shit. Thucydides was much more than a &quot;scribe&quot; and his dryness in comparison to his contemporaries is of historical significance and was hugely important to the development of recorded history. I don&#39;t expect the cretins at GQ to know anything about that. Thucydides has done more important things than every single person who&#39;s ever been involved in GQ,  put together, could ever even <em>hope</em> to accomplish. I now associate you with this sort of politically-motivated anti-intellectualism.</p>

I told you I&#39;m not alt-right, you can see from my comments I&#39;m not, and you&#39;re plowing ahead with the idea that I&#39;m alt-right. Oh, while also chastising me for not knowing anything about the alt right&#39;s apparent association with ancient Greek history.</p>

<p>What a real gem this sub got in you a couple weeks ago, huh?</p>

<p>Also, you have a weird obsession with some celebrity, looks like. I&#39;m guessing you&#39;re a teenager, lol.</p>

<p><em>Why</em> do they like 300?</p>

<p>Also, what is wrong with liking the battle of thermoplylae? I&#39;ve thought it was a very cool historical way before thay movie ever came out. I started a degree in history and studied the Greek-Persian wars for years before thay movie was made.</p>

<p>It cracks me up how obviously painful it is for you to be in a position where you have to discuss and back up ideas you clearly haven&#39;t thought-out ahead of time.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Do two wrongs make a right? Why not just say any act of violence against someone because of something they can’t control like the colour of their skin is wrong?</p>

<p>Lots of people seem to be happy to hold double-standards and say it’s fine for one group to suffer because that social group made another suffer in the past. At what point do we stop using the past to justify violence in the present?</p>

<p>I’m from Tower Hamlets in London where “white British” is behind “Bangladeshi” in terms of numbers in the borough (think it’s 32% vs 33%). That’s just ethnicity, if we look at the data for religious identification in the area then I think I remember “Muslim” being by far the most popular religion in the area. Why shouldn’t the majority religious demographic of an area face criticism if they’re given funding and that funding isn’t positively impacting everyone?</p>

<p>Criticism of “Muslims” needs to be more focused. As with everything, most Muslims just want to live their lives and get along with people. There are definitely radical elements who are clearly allowed to exist because people higher up find them useful for some reason or another. From what I can gather it’s the Wahhabist Muslims who are the source of most of the radical aspects.</p>

<p>Hopefully this would stop the knee-jerk cries of “racism” whenever Islam is criticised. There are plenty of white Muslims in the UK, so I’d be happy to point that out if that meant people stopped conflating criticism of aspects of a religion and political system with racism.</p>

<p>There are radical Muslims in London though. Visit Whitechapel and if you’re a woman walking there at night wearing western clothes then there’s a good chance that you’ll be called a “slag”, “slut” etc. Obviously this is anecdotal but several woman I know have been followed by groups of young Muslim guys and threatened specifically because of what they were wearing.</p>

<p>I’ve seen a few of Lauren Southern’s and Tommy Morrison’s videos and some of their arguments are reasonable, but they’re too quick to get emotional and resort to “cries of what about the children”.</p>

<p>I don’t see why it’s useful to ban them though. If anything it just lends more credibility to the notion that they’re treated unfairly.  </p>

<p>If you look into the history, it seems that there’s a very cozy relationship with the British Royal family and the House of Saud. British intelligence in the early 1900s found it useful to have people on their payroll promote a more radical interpretation of Islam </p>

<p>I read a few of your comments in the thread and I don’t know if you think that people who criticise Islam must somehow be alt righters who believe western civilisation is then pinnacle of human achievement.</p>

<p>I don’t think that at all, recent western civilisation has been the story of technology and science and doing anything and everything to maintain that advantage. There’s plenty of great civilisations that can be admired. Saying that though, it’s perfectly fine to think that western society is awful, but when people say this but still want take from the welfare state or use the National Healh Service for free then they should expect criticism. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Two negatives might make a positive in mathematics. Do you believe that is true in society too? You want to live in a world where it’s an eye for an eye? How far back can people go to justify violence against a social group?</p>

<p>I haven’t been able to find any reliable  statistics about the farmer’s deaths in South Africa, but I would question “relatively peaceful” as the numbers at the minimum seem to show a significant increase in violence and murders. I’m not sure where you got the number of “100s of millions of blacks being murdered” either? </p>

<p>So do you believe murdering people because they belong to a social group that treated another social group poorly in the past is justified? As long as you’re not hypocritical and accept it when another group murders people for the actions of a social group then I guess that’s at least consistent. It’s stupid , but it is consistent </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m from Alberta, Canada.</p>

<p>Laura Southern was or is still working for Rebel Media which acts like a right wing Conservative &#39;news&#39; outlet here in Canada.</p>

<p>Her boss is this guy named Ezra Levant who made a name for himself by publishing the Mohammed pictures in the Western Standard. He&#39;s Jewish but used the argument that it was &#39;free speech&#39; to avoid Canada&#39;s hate speech laws.</p>

<p>It&#39;s funny because if you tried publishing drawings of bad stereotypical Jewish people, B&#39;nai Brith would be all over your ass as well as the hate crimes police, and probably the media.</p>

<p>It&#39;s hilariously hypocritical.</p>

<p>Anyways...</p>

<p>Alberta has oil. </p>

<p>Conservatism here in Alberta is largely dictated by people outside of Canada in the oil industry, Koch Brothers, Heritage Foundation, Exxon, etc all rile up the rural right wingers here to insure that we don&#39;t ever try to nationalize our resources again.</p>

<p>Ezra Levant is a big time oil industry shill and uses his outlet to attack anti-oil activists, which are mostly college kids.</p>

<p>This is where Laura Southern comes in. She acts like a men&#39;s rights activist and goes against campus feminist activists. Many of which are also environmental activists.</p>

<p>A lot of this basically started as a really roundabout way to insure the oil companies get access to Alberta&#39;s oil again. </p>

<p>That reminds me, they sort of have a habit of lying by omission.</p>

<p>Like, the Rebel isn&#39;t recognized as an actual news outlet but that didn&#39;t stop them from going to the Alberta Legislative Building and making a stink before getting kicked out. They wrote it up like they were some underdog reporters who got picked on because they weren&#39;t part of the &#39;liberal media&#39;.</p>

<p>We don&#39;t have &#39;liberal media&#39; in Alberta that isn&#39;t the university newspapers. All our news is all corporate owned. All 4 major papers here are owned by one company and it&#39;s owned by Levant&#39;s old boss and some shadow investors from the US connected to Goldman Sachs.</p>

<p>Anything Southern or Levant say should be scrutinized heavily to make sure all the facts are accurate.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not saying It was right for them to ban her, but she lied on her form and claimed she was pakistani. Thus, allowing them to come at her sideways. Would she have been banned if she didn&#39;t lie? why did she lie? for jokes? </p>

<p>The fact she lied devalues all this outrage imo. From THEIR pov (UK police, seems nobody is looking at it from that way), They could classify it as terrorism in their own twisted way. Its a sucky situation but she brought this on herself imo.</p>

<p>It reminds me of when people talk shit and then when are confronted cry foul. </p>

<p>&quot;Sabbatean-Frankism as the Paradigm of the Modern Left</p>

<p>What do all these influential intellectuals all have in common?</p>

<ol>
<li>Communism (Marx)</li>
<li>Sexual depravity (Freud)</li>
<li>Corporate Leftism (Bernays)</li>
<li>Multiculturalism (Horace Kallen)</li>
<li>Deconstructivism/Critical Theory (Walter Benjamin)</li>
<li>Frankfurt School (Adorno)</li>
<li>Radical jurisprudence (Brandeis, Frankfurter, and Cardozo)</li>
<li>Large-scale, non-selective immigration (Israel Zangwill, Emma Lazarus)</li>
</ol>

<p>They are all linked to Sabbatean-Frankism, a distinct quasi-Satanic schism within Jewry. The extraordinary prevalence of Sabbatean-Frankist influence among top Jewish intellectuals from 1850-1950 makes it statistically impossible to deny its role because of the impossible coincidences.</p>

<p>The Sabbatean-Frankists sought to invert traditional Jewish-Christian values, including the 10 Commandments, restrictions on debauched sexuality, man’s dominion over the environment, etc. Further, given Sabbatean-Frankism’s apocalyptic nature, the modern Left is riven with irrational destructive impulses.</p>

<p>This general thesis has been explored by historians Paul Johnson and Gershom Scholem, but never in such detail. There are several implications of this thesis:</p>

<p>• The failures of the contemporary Left do not represent “good faith” secular humanist efforts gone wrong. It is very possible that Freud, Marx, and other Sabbatean-Frankist intellectuals purpose-built their ideas to destroy the West.</p>

<p>• The US Supreme Court was heavily influenced by Sabbatean-Frankists. Their impact help cause a revolution via court fiat in the 50s-70s that undemocratically imposed decadent/anti-Judeo-Christian (i.e. Frankist) values on the country.</p>

<p>• Since the Left is fundamentally a quasi-Satanic movement devoted to destroying traditional Judeo-Christian civilization, it is a natural ally with like-minded Islam, despite superficial differences (feminism, gay rights). Islam and the Left will seamlessly cooperate to destroy the West as they cooperated to topple the Shah in the Iranian Revolution.&quot;</p>

<p>I am not in prison, I am free. You cannot speak for most, because some are in prison for various illegal activities</p>

<p>In prison = not free.</p>

<p>I can also argue that Alive/Body = Not Free. Its all relative</p>

<p>Also it’s not a population thing. US literally has more prisoners than China.</p>

<p>So basically we have a shit ton more criminals. Got it</p>
