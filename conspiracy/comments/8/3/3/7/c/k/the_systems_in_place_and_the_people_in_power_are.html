        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>there is an answer! the good news is that it starts with you, yes you, and the choices and relationships you make. the bad news is that it takes sacrifice on your part. but if you dream of a better world, those sacrifices might damn well be worth it.</p>

<p>we live in a society that is increasingly divisive of the common people -- as in, the vast majority of us, in every country on every continent. greedy people are good at taking power trips at the expense of the rest of us; they are equally good at turning us on each other as they cackle maniacally behind the curtain (or that&#39;s how I imagine it, anyway).</p>

<p>but we can fight that <em>together</em> by taking certain steps to divest from the Powers That Be. indeed, you can allott some time towards outrage and disgust, but the real effects come through when we put that outrage into practice.</p>

<p>i don&#39;t claim to have all the answers, but there are a few ideas that i think might benefit people on both an individual and (ideally) a universal scale:</p>

<p>(1) disengage from popular entertainment industries that have proven themselves time and again to be corrupt and damaging. don&#39;t pay to see blockbuster films! don&#39;t keep up with celebrities on snapchat! hell, delete your twitter account! </p>

<p>INSTEAD --
support your local artists and musicians! rent books from the town library! meet up with your trusted friends and brainstorm over a beer about making the world a better place!</p>

<p>(2) be conscious when you buy. whether you&#39;re an environmentalist or not, you&#39;re surely aware of the vast amounts of waste humans have created and continue to create. you&#39;re also surely aware of the corporate horrors that control the food industry (and most other industries as well). while you&#39;re at it, divesting from amazon is a good idea, too.</p>

<p>INSTEAD --
buy secondhand! get thrifty! i rarely buy new clothing these days but i still manage to out-dress most of my peers and colleagues. as for food, it may be the hipster thing to do, but buy local and organic when you can. it&#39;s good for the environment, and you&#39;re less likely to be taking part in worker exploitation when you know that your tomatoes came straight from Farmer Joe and not a farm 500 miles away. (bonus points for buying food that is GMO-free; the effects of GMOs on human health are questionable, but it&#39;s well-known that Monsanto is pretty evil.) </p>

<p>(3) develop a sense of community with the people around you! as fun as it can be screaming into your personal corner of the Internet, the value of everyday, face-to-face conversation should not be overlooked. don&#39;t let your bitterness towards the evils of this world blind you to the relative innocence of those around you.</p>

<p>INSTEAD --
assume the best of the people you meet, even if they disagree with you! <em>especially</em> if they disagree with you! instead of a shouting match, have a conversation over coffee. find out where people are coming from. don&#39;t view arguments as things that you win or lose. view them as a chance to deconstruct the issue and come to a deeper understanding of the problem at hand. you will probably still disagree, at least in your first few conversations; but if you can <em>both</em> agree on actively listening and responding to each other, your argument won&#39;t be a waste of time. it will be valuable to everyone involved. you may even make friends with people you never would have imagined befriending.</p>

<p>of course this list is not at all exhaustive, and if you have any other ideas, i&#39;d love to hear them. but doing these things (even if i don&#39;t stick to them 100% of the time) makes me feel at least a little bit more independent from corruption. </p>

<p>TL;DR: divest from the powerful and corrupt; invest in community and goodwill!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well said OP. No snowflake thinks it is responsible for the avalanche...but they <em>all</em> are. This goes for positive change as well.</p>

<p>This is an important first step in deprogramming oneself from the Elite memetic structures. Hollywood, the Press, and the Record Industry work to push the &quot;approved&quot; memetic structures onto the masses. Propaganda on the Societal scale.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>support your local artists and musicians! rent books from the town library! meet up with your trusted friends and brainstorm over a beer about making the world a better place!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Also just support local business and Artisans...go to your mom and pop stores (if you have any). Eat local, avoid chains, and try and keep the money in your community.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>This is why Consumerism is pushed so heavily. The entire system relies on constant demand and growth, with planned obsolescence thrown in to guarantee the consumer keeps coming back...</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>People want new, flashy, name brand clothes because of the memetic power the branding has on them and others. Status...that swoosh on your shoes, or that label on your hat, shows people you&#39;re <em>important</em>, because they have been trained to associate those symbols with wealth and power.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>but buy local and organic when you can. it&#39;s good for the environment, and you&#39;re less likely to be taking part in worker exploitation when you know that your tomatoes came straight from Farmer Joe and not a farm 500 miles away.

</blockquote>

<p>Yes! Buy organic and buy local! How I so desperately hope that Detroit could pave the way for the American City of the 21st century...self sufficient urban farming. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>develop a sense of community with the people around you! as fun as it can be screaming into your personal corner of the Internet, the value of everyday, face-to-face conversation should not be overlooked. don&#39;t let your bitterness towards the evils of this world blind you to the relative innocence of those around you.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We all must start by recognizing how we fit into our local communities and families, then work outwards from there. Change starts on the personal level. As Tolkien said: &quot; It is the small everyday deeds of ordinary folk that keep the darkness at bay.&quot;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>assume the best of the people you meet, even if they disagree with you! especially if they disagree with you! instead of a shouting match, have a conversation over coffee. find out where people are coming from. don&#39;t view arguments as things that you win or lose. view them as a chance to deconstruct the issue and come to a deeper understanding of the problem at hand.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>People are taught not to see things this way. It&#39;s an Us vs. Them mentality baked from childhood. Shout down dissenting voices, uplift your own, ignore all to the contrary. This is one of the hardest things we must overcome. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It is easy to talk about fairness and equality when you have little or nothing. As one passes the threshold of middle class and up things tend to not seem so black and white. &quot;I&#39;m alright, Jack/keep your hands off of my stack&quot;. People tend to make token gestures of charity and anti-consumerism (things that don&#39;t effect their life style too much, but satisfy their ego). One day of life in the West is a lifetime in the third world. So what is one to do? First, stop lying to yourself about fairness and some sort of token, simple life. I think as you pointed out (some what indirectly) &quot;Try to be nice to people, avoid eating fat, read a good book every now and then, get some walking in, and try and live together in peace and harmony with people of all creeds and nations&quot; ~Monty Python; The Meaning of Life.</p>

<p>yes, there are so many things that I find to be false in their preachiness for &quot;bettering the world.&quot; charity is one of them, to an extent; not necessarily <em>bad</em>, but you have to understand that it&#39;s generally a band-aid on whatever festering wound of poverty/sickness/war. </p>

<p>indeed, life isn&#39;t fair, but the closer it gets to being so, the more sacrifice and effort it takes from the threshold you reference. regardless of sacrifice, I see that effort as being beneficial to all of us in its own right.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>of course we are just the minority, but that&#39;s sort of the point -- instead of giving up, and just accepting things, we have to at least <em>try</em> to change <em>something</em>. </p>

<p>i know i never would have tried to change a thing if I wasn&#39;t introduced to people who were absolutely invested in said change. the more you put your beliefs into practice, the more people are exposed to them and will be inspired to join you. the whole world will never wake up if waking up just seems hopeless.</p>

Choose not to partake in the corrupt pyramid scheme and instead serve the true God, who gave his only begotten son, Jesus Christ, to die on the cross for our sins, to be buried for three days and to be resurrected. Treat others the way that you would want to be treated instead of running over them on your way to get money and power. This life is short, but the afterlife is eternal. Burn in the Lake of Fire for eternity, or be with God in New Jerusalem for eternity.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Great post. I agree with your overall sentiment, maybe not some of the specifics</p>

<blockquote>
<p>assume the best of the people you meet</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This can set you up into getting taking advantage of, conned, manipulated and put into danger if you aren&#39;t wise. I think this piece of advice depends completely on the context - e.g. don&#39;t automatically do this with strangers in the street, strangers that call at your house etc. That isn&#39;t to say, automatically distrust as much as automatically trust - but to just be aware of the possibility. Indeed, one should aim for optimism over pessimism and fear, but my point is not to completely disengaged from the survival instinct.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>don&#39;t view arguments as things that you win or lose. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>I agree. This is basically how interactions going on the internet 9 out of 10 times. It&#39;s a disgrace.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>disengage from popular entertainment industries 
support your local artists and musicians! rent books from the town library</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In general I agree, but there are things worth paying for that are not available locally. We shouldn&#39;t completely disregard the fruits of capitalism, however much the system is corrupt. Do you want to restrict people from watching The Sopranos, Game of Thrones, The Wire - great works of art from popular entertainment industries, along with all the films The Godfather, Apocalypse No, The Matrix, The Truman Show.</p>

<p>The rest I haven&#39;t highlighted I agree with.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>doing these things (even if i don&#39;t stick to them 100% of the time) makes me feel at least a little bit more independent from corruption. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is the key part - the individual has the capability to shape his/her worldview. You are the master who makes the grass green. By taking particular action in your own life, you bring light to yourself - and when the light is within yourself, you share it with others. To be consumed by darkness and corruption can disconnect  you from reality, from others, as your perception is colored by the particular reality tunnel you inhabit. So ensure the reality tunnel you inhabit is one that errs on the side of optimism, that chooses smiles over frowns, laughter over anger.</p>
