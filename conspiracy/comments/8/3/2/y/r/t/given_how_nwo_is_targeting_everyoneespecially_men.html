<p>Nobody really asked that question, though. The truth is, men and women have many problems they share, and they each have problems that disproportionately affect each sex. Its all subjective and I think actually pretty pointless to argue over who has it worse.</p>

You may get your first leader to be the most awesome man on earth, but when he dies people will start bending he&#39;s words into something that will benefit your new leader. That&#39;s why the only new kind of successful society will have to be one where we all see eachother as brothers and sister and help eachother to be independent of everybody</p>
