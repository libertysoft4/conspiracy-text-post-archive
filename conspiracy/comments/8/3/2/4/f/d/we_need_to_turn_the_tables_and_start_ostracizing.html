    <div class="md"><p>To me, it seems incredibly short sighted. It boils down to, okay ... Lets say, before we get ahead of ourselves here, say I say &quot;The Russian intelligence forces interfered in the US elections&quot; - if you think &quot;So what, you think the CIA hasn&#39;t interfered in anyone&#39;s elections?!&quot; is an appropriate, relevant response to that - then we don&#39;t have the basis for a conversation because I think you&#39;re a fucking idiot.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think you&#39;re missing the point, with all do respect.</p>

<p>It wasn&#39;t just some Russians, and they didn&#39;t just make normal social media posts. This was a coordinated effort to subvert US democracy. They weren&#39;t just normal people on the internet like me or you, they were there only to spread disinformation and propaganda. They used targeted ads, they targeted voter rolls, they used social media and message boards to influence people, and with all that they pumped Russian money into the GOP machine. We&#39;re not talking about a few Russian kids making a meme on the internet. This was a coordinated, military-style operation.</p>

<p>So what about Israel? Does that make it okay what Russia did? I will say, at least with Israel, the US gets the strategic benefits of having an ally in the mideast. There&#39;s at least something they get out of the relationship. It&#39;s a shit sandwich, but at least they don&#39;t have the end goal of weakening the US as a whole. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I didn&#39;t say, &quot;but they do it too&quot;, did I?</p>

<p>I was simply commenting on the OP&#39;s comment. If the same people that turn a blind eye to Isarelis meddling in every single aspect of US affairs care a lot about alleged Russian meddling then they are straight up hypocrites.</p>

<p>And, frankly, your comment that &quot;Israel does it too&quot;, is nonsense…they have far more influence in US affairs and have had for decades. They influence where and when the US goes to war…they have dual citizens in various levels of gov. Their largest US lobby group doesn&#39;t even register as a foreign agent.</p>

<p>No, Israel has done and does do far more and far worse than Russia ever has or ever likely will.</p>

<p>&quot;Ostracize&quot; might be a strong way of putting it, but liars and the people who support those lies should be seen as lesser for doing that shit.
