<p>2) Russia was responsible for the apparent progress (they could have had the missiles in the region for decades)</p>

<p>3) Russia helped put Trump in power, conspired to create a fake nuclear conflict with NK and USA</p>

<p>4) Russia helped Trump resolve the fake nuclear conflict (probably in direct dialogue with Jong-un the entire time)</p>

<p>5) Why? Well Trump family in power is as close to a Russian style system that America could become right now. However, if Trump retains enough popularity by deescalating a fake conflict he might win a second term, and then his daughter (who will be far more popular than Donald himself) might win two terms after that. Sixteen years of Trump, and Putin asserting control over the American way of life.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I can’t deny the feeling that the 180 from Kim is Russian backed. But if this is a trap, to what end? It’s obvious from Putin’s little missile video he considers the US an enemy, so why 1)Put Trump in power and 2)Make Trump look good? 
Also noteworthy, a few of the reports said that Kim is seeking a complete stop to all nukes, does that mean he demands us to get rid of ours? Is Trump gullible enough to agree and leave us without a Russian deterrent? The whole thing seems fishy to me.</p>

<p>From North Korea&#39;s side, their story is that they advanced their nuclear program and demonstrated that they can strike out at the United States, and because they demonstrated their strength they have forced the mighty United States to come to them as equals.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Now let me try to spin this back a little.</p>

<p>1) North Korea did not ever make the nuclear progress they claimed</p>

<p>Yes they did and the received propably help with this.</p>

<p>2) Russia was responsible for the apparent progress (they could have had the missiles in the region for decades)</p>

<p>No Russia is not responsible, but Space X might very well be. If NK had the weapons before they would have threatend a long time ago with them. This is IF they were a &quot;stand allone&quot; force to beging with.</p>

<p>3) Russia helped put Trump in power, conspired to create a fake nuclear conflict with NK and USA</p>

<p>Russia may or may not have helped Trump in the election. However they do help each other to free the world of the actual evil and danger threatening us all.</p>

<p>4) Russia helped Trump resolve the fake nuclear conflict (probably in direct dialogue with Jong-un the entire time)</p>

<p>Nope, NK is just a puppet of the single thread to Humanity we all need to concour. I am very glad to see some actual cooperation and a lot of progress, but one must look deep below the mainstream surface</p>

<p>5) Why? Well Trump, Putin and many more people are aware of the actual evil and are trying to solve this. And many, many, many more people are also starting to up to the dark facts and the actual truths and  history behind everything. When too many people re-unite and return to their natural state of Love instead of fear, the evil knows it would not stand a chance against Humanity. That is why NKs &quot;burps&quot; and certain other events are staged (upto a level), they are intented to create as much chaos, duality, misery and distractions as possible while tring to hide all truths that can harm them.</p>
