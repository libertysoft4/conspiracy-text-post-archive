    <div class="md"><p>actually yes. most conspiracy&#39;s can be easily dismissed if one is willing to look at the most plausible explanations first and consider them with more weight than the far reaching explanations. the conspiracy&#39;s that can&#39;t be explained away by common sense are the ones that are worth pursuing and exploring. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>look i&#39;m not trying to convince you either way, i&#39;ve just found in my life that common sense leads to a better and less confusing life. i also used to work in law enforcement in several capacities so i do have some relevant experience in how cops responding to the scene would act. do you really think it&#39;s impossible that the responding officer would have talked to a victim running from the school and that the victim would have given him a description of the shooter? i followed the incident live on the police scanner soon after the call went out and they knew fairly quickly who their suspect is. so why is it so crazy that someone on scene would have a description of the shooter? a lot of times when calls go out, the 911 caller gives a description over the phone. so are you willing to say that everytime a cop shows up knowing what a suspect is wearing that it means there is a secret plan that the cop is in on? i just can&#39;t follow that logic. all the best though friend, i don&#39;t mean to argue. this just seems like a simple explanation that doesn&#39;t justify a conspiracy to me personally.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>If the cop learned from a witness, they would have included it in the radio communication.</p>

<p>“Students/Staff indicate shooter wearing maroon shirt, ROTC”</p>

<p>Or if they witnessed the shooter the radio communication would have been much more specific and would have included the shooters movements and location.</p>

<p>“Shooter moving to south end of school, I’m in pursuit, suspect wearing maroon shirt”.</p>

<p>It is more interesting to me that the cop was able to get a description out so quickly, yet the schools caneras were on 20 minute tape delay.</p>

<p>Poor Cruz boy was set up, that’s really the most simple explanation. Since CNN and MSM are complicit in the story now, they have to run with it.</p>

<p>Now, the real question...</p>

<p>Was it really a terrorist attack on our schools and they are using ‘gun control’ narratives to drown it out and keep us safe by remaining in the dark?</p>

<p>that is an assumption. </p>

<blockquote>

<p>this is true, which is why i stand by my original statement that the cop himself didn&#39;t see the suspect at the point where he radioed the suspect description, so obviously he was operating on second hand information. </p>

<blockquote>

<p>again this supports the theory that he had second hand info from a victim/someone that had escaped the school. </p>

<blockquote>

<p>are you denying that he had a history of social media posts that made people suspect that he would do something like this? or that the FBI had already been alerted to the possibility that he had threatened to shoot up a school? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The witness said body armor.  That doesn&#39;t mean that she is exactly describing what he was wearing.  Just as if a witness said he was carrying a &quot;machine gun&quot; wouldn&#39;t mean that that was what weapon was actually used. </p>

<p>He arrives at the school wearing the red shirt and carrying a backpack/bag.  A school administrator sees him and calls it in on the radio (he&#39;s a known problem at this school).  In the bag he has the weapon and a flak-jacket type vest and a face covering, puts these on and does shooting.  Could have been a vest to hold magazines or a fake airsoft vest to look more tactical.  Who knows.  Then he ditches the vest and weapon and leaves trying to not be noticed.  </p>

<p>This is not an incredible or impossible thing to imagine.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m saying that it is entirely plausible that the sheriff outside of the building got the correct description from one of the students fleeing the building. </p>

<p>Frankly, I think he <em>saw</em> the shooter exit the building and still did nothing. That would explain why he had the proper description, and why the story is full of holes (he doesn&#39;t want to admit that he saw the shooter and did nothing, so he just lies and says the description came from elsewhere).</p>

<p>I was further picking on the quip about how the &quot;non crisis actors&quot; saw him weaing a body armor and a helmet. He wasn&#39;t: they caught the guy, and he wasn&#39;t wearing all black.</p>
