        <p><span class="badge badge-primary">275</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;2018-03-12 by <a class="author" href="../../../../../../../../user/screwbacca.html">screwbacca</a></p>
        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I originally posted this to <a href="/r/TIFU">/r/TIFU</a> about 2 weeks ago and a mod removed it for an opinionated rule, still a little salty I wasted all my time typing it up for it to be removed and no one to read it so I&#39;m copy/pasting it here because it&#39;s mostly relevant. </p>

<p>Also, I&#39;m kind of in a f it sort of thought now so if the mods allow it I will name the company and religious organization. </p>

<p>I work(ed) for one of the largest online financial platforms in the world for 3 years as a credit collections agent, for the sake of my privacy and potential liability sake I won&#39;t be specifically stating either the company or religious organizations names in this post. I apologize for the length ahead of time, I&#39;m a very detail oriented person.</p>

<p>Part of what my job entails fraud investigation, aside from continuous pestering calls to individuals past due on their debt identifying potential fraud accounts and sending them to our back office in order to get them out of our queue and out of the account holders name. Typically 2 common ways of finding this involve checking public access information and cross referencing it with account details and looking for check-kiter&#39;s (people who will float a credit line on bad checks for the entire balance each month only to have them all bounce/return after they&#39;ve maxed their credit multiple times). Fraud is extremely prevalent at this company because we&#39;re an online based credit line that for some genius reason does not report to credit bureaus. While looking for these cases I personally preferred a certain report that identifies last payment dates and sorting from oldest to new. This would place all accounts with 0 payment history at the top. Not always fraud, mostly people who are old and somehow didn&#39;t realize they even opened a credit line. One such account however pulled up for me 2 months ago with a $12,000 principal that was very suspicious and laid the ground work to my termination.</p>

<p>This account that I had identified only ever had one transaction for the amount of the entire balance donated to a very specific church 3 states away from the account holders public address. Got &#39;em. Now I&#39;m excited, $12,000 moved out of the queue in my position was the difference of $600 in bonus pay out at the end of the month, I eagerly submit it. 3 days later it is denied by our back office with 0 reason given, which is odd as a reason code or description always has to be given for documentation sake. I ping my contact who works in fraud and am met with a response basically saying &quot;leave this alone&quot;. I didn&#39;t. I needed to know why, I just lost a potential $600, did I make a mistake? It seemed very cut and dry.</p>

<p>I spent the next few days occasionally popping in and out of this account trying to find any evidence that it was legitimate and not opened fraudulently, but none of the customers information was matching with their public information history outside of the stolen ssn used to open it. Finally I drop it and move on, I&#39;ve got other work to do.</p>

<p>Cut to present day and I&#39;m doing my usual fraud check on the new queue of accounts we were just given, and I stumble upon another account with 0 payment history, full balance donated to the church. Now I&#39;m intrigued, was this just a crazy coincidence or is there something more? Spoiler: it&#39;s something more. Now I&#39;m looking at the church&#39;s account in our system, 2.3 million dollars in available funds, one of the largest open cash amounts I&#39;ve seen in my time at the company and it was almost entirely made out of donations from other accounts in my company. Now, I only have limited access to the systems I&#39;m using to view this (and in all honesty the amount of access an entry level position has here is WAY too much if you ask me, I&#39;m proof of that) so I can&#39;t pull information on any other accounts from the church&#39;s other than ones that are associated with my credit department. I spent about an hour looking at this before I had to take it to my boss. In just that hour I found just under $200,000 &quot;donated&quot; to this church within the last 2 months via credit lines with 0 payment history, with seemingly 0 pattern to the donating accounts. There&#39;s also massive amounts being sent from this church&#39;s account to another under the same religion in a different state where they&#39;re based out of. My boss brings this to his boss who brings it to her boss and I&#39;m feeling proud as hell, I just made the biggest fraud discovery I&#39;ve ever seen at my company and all my coworkers are dumbfounded. The next day I am put on a corrective action for &quot;misuse of company assets&quot; and my access to this particular system I was viewing temporarily revoked.</p>

<p>I&#39;m tilted. I went out of my job description to do something for the company, potentially saving untold amounts of money, and I&#39;m punished for it? I requested a sit down with my boss and his boss in the room to discuss why I just got dicked. It didn&#39;t go well. I&#39;m told if I do anything like this again I will be terminated and I need to stick to making calls, this is not my job. I&#39;m furious, but I need this job; so I play along, making call after call as a mindless drone trying to pretend nothing happened when 5 days later I&#39;m walked out the door. The security team pulled all my computer screen footage from the past month and booted me for reading news articles three weeks prior on my computer during a break (which is clearly shown on screen, there&#39;s a sort of clock-in clock-out, lunch / break status tool on every computer that&#39;s permanently on screen) but was told there&#39;s break room computers for that kind of activity, not my production area, and kindly shown the door.</p>

<p>So yeah, that&#39;s my short novel, hope I didn&#39;t waste too much of your day, thanks for reading, part of this was sort of a vent to get this off my chest and I appreciate your time..</p>

<p>TL;DR I was fired for going outside of my job title and trying to please my bosses by exposing a massive case of credit fraud.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Look for legal support - speak to a few different lawyers and weigh your options as well as contact media outlets - I wouldn&#39;t name the company and church just yet, but if they&#39;re really a big company I would start getting in touch with legal support and media outlets ASAP just to be on the safe side. </p>

<p>After that you should start naming names, because by remaining anonymous and making posts like this, a big company can bury you before you make a move. </p>

<p>Good luck and sorry for getting shafted. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Seems like money laundering. First step is to find a mark. Someone that&#39;s in hospice care or senial. Have them open a credit account and make the donation to the church. Then open a bank account with dirty cash. Say you found it under grampas bed, his life savings, and now you want it safe in a bank, in his name, since he has so many credit card bills that need to be paid back. </p>

<p>Money is then paid to the credit card company and then to the church. Same guys who provide the dirty money are also employees at the church and get the money clean. </p>

<p>Question is how deep is the credit company. All in or just happy getting kick backs. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, it sounds really shady. Collection companies come and go, and I could see how they could be ripe for mondey laundering. Basically they tend to get sued a lot, so there&#39;s a real incentive for them to be ephemeral. When I was a credit card collector, we were getting sued constantly. I got threatened by customers every single hour.</p>
