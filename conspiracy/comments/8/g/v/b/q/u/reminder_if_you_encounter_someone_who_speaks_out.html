That&#39;s why CA sucks at it so badly - they were taught by a complete shitshow of a human being. <a href="http://www.breitbart.com/big-journalism/2017/01/27/with-allies-comparing-him-to-mugatu-david-brock-compares-his-website-to-breitbart-news/">Seriously, check out some comments made about the mental stability of David Brock</a>.</p>

<p>Don&#39;t forget - David Brock dated the man who founded Comet Ping-Pong, James Alefantis. 
<a href="https://imgur.com/CZfflLz">Here&#39;s a copy of the deed these two shared that I found through the DC public records search for property</a></p>

<p>So you have an alleged fucking lunatic paid 7 figures by a presidential candidate to stop us from saying negative things about the candidate and that&#39;s hardly mentioned in major media (and never in a negative way), but Cambridge Analytica doing the exact same public opinion manipulation is somehow getting 24/7 media coverage?</p>

<p>I call bullshit. Both organizations are wrong, both need to be stopped and both parties are neck-deep in filthy politics. It&#39;s time someone establishes some laws regarding full disclosure of political activities online for BOTH PARTIES.</p>

<p>Personally, I&#39;ve been working with an attorney in my home state to bring suit against CTR for violating my states anti-cyberbullying statutes. Many other states have similar laws. I&#39;m not interested in winning, I&#39;m interested in bringing this issue to light. Unfortunately, this takes FOREVER - but in the meantime, remember that both parties can be shit and currently, both are. Don&#39;t fall for the partisan divisive distractions.</p>

<p>One question I have is what is distinctly &quot;Russian shilling propaganda&quot; or talking points? I get something like Skripal defense, but it really seems like a lot of things get labeled &quot;Russian&quot; and I&#39;m not sure what the demarcation is. Could you give me some examples? </p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Agreed. </p>

<p>Some old examples would be when Russia invaded Ukraine, and there was tons of accounts that were coming out and trying to spin it, defend it, or deny it. It was mostly isolated to the worldnews sub. </p>

<p>In the politics sub, it shows up as new accounts that try to act like extremes on both sides, with calling for actions of violence against the other side. </p>

<p>I&#39;m also highly suspicious of people that either constantly praise or defend Putin or Russian interests. </p>

<p>I will say though, that I&#39;m all for searching for truth, no matter where it points to. I&#39;m skeptical of the MSM narratives surrounding Syria and I&#39;m skeptical about the MSM narratives surrounding Skripal. Doesn&#39;t mean that I trust what Russia is saying either.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Those are all straightforward examples. </p>

<p>Why is it that the term &quot;Russian&quot; has become a pejorative though? Am I the only person that feels like it&#39;s a little odd to single out another country as universally horrible? I grew up in the 80s and I saw the wall come down. Maybe I have a different feeling about the country than many millennials. I think very similar to Iran, and at times the US, the people in charge are making decisions that the populous may not agree with but doesn&#39;t have a whole lot of say in the end either. </p>

<p>The term is also used widely when not discussing issues related to Russia also. Constitutional amendments for hundreds of years are suddenly Russian talking points and I&#39;m trying to understand the nuance of what gets labeled vs. what doesn&#39;t and why. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sure they do. You&#39;re talking to one of many that have been running analytics on this sub and related artifacts for a long time. </p>

<p>There&#39;s a number of obvious and persistent entities that keep this sub in their crosshairs. Russians really aren&#39;t much of a factor here that I&#39;ve seen. JDIF, Monsanto, Fukishima topics really do have professionals interacting in the threads (and an honorable mention for the PG apologists), but I just don&#39;t believe enough people care about Russian interests in this thread for them to expend too much effort.</p>

<p>Now take something like <a href="/r/syrianwar">/r/syrianwar</a> or related topics and I think you&#39;ll see a lot more interference. Just my $.02.</p>

<p>Like I said before, I&#39;m just skeptical of people who will say that CTR/Shareblue or American propagandists shills exist (I acknowledge they do), but somehow Russia doesn&#39;t get involved with online social media propaganda shilling efforts. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_brigades">Especially when we know they did it before.</a></p>

I know that Media Matters and Cambridge Analytica are major players in the social manipulation game, but I&#39;m highly skeptical of the scope and purpose of efforts by Russian groups and the degree of their affiliation with the Russian government.

<p>Read these two articles, the letter in byline and the capabilities of SCL years ago. They will have only gotten better since then.
The combination of decades of British establishment propaganda (world war winning), being on the winning side of every election, using protonmail, having the Facebook data was only a minor detail tbh. They&#39;ve been doing military psyops for years, MoD, DoD, foreign countries too.
Faking a chemical lab leak was their advertised capability in 2005. 13 years later, what more could they stage?</p>

<p>The scariest bit is that this isn&#39;t even too controversial. The Russians learned their online side from a UK company! They&#39;ve infused it with their decades of disinformation and you&#39;ve got a government paralyzing mixture.
Instead of looking in the mirror after greed from 1974 (when productivity outgrew wages: rise of management and investors always winning), they want to build a boogie man so we don&#39;t look up at the crooks sat at the top.</p>

<p>This is the real secret behind it all, that&#39;s why they&#39;re clutching at Russian disinformation, they don&#39;t want people to wake up to the decades of lies.</p>

Advertisers are players too, again their only doing it to make money, but they can&#39;t be ignored.</p>

<p>There is definitely Russian disinformation about, it&#39;s just that it&#39;s also a convenient tool to cover-up awkward truths.
As I&#39;ve said before, Russia or not, the DNC hack was about the <em>contents</em> of the emails (showing the dodgy relationships and collusion against Sanders), the hack was secondary. It would have been a good target, but if Clinton had better principles, she might have won.</p>

<p>It&#39;s a good tool to use against anyone against the neoliberal consensus, see the smears of Jeremy Corybn and Jill Stien, I doubt either are <em>Russian bots</em> but don&#39;t worry, they&#39;ll try either getting that across anyhow.</p>

<p>Republican partisan think tanks came of age in the 1960&#39;s. Democratic counterparts only started arriving in the 80&#39;s and 90&#39;s. Democratic propaganda is far behind and much smaller than Republican propaganda, and Republicans spend far more than Democrats because <em>Republicans want to deregulate the money machine and make money=speech</em>.

    <div class="md"><p>Well remember that CTR morphed into other entities including ShareBlue which is still active and appears well-funded. CTR was too tarnished in the primaries to continue with that brand, but the people that brought it to us haven&#39;t gone anywhere.</p>

<p>And I&#39;ll say that if you can quantify it than I would like to discuss ML models with you. But you won&#39;t articulate an answer to my question I&#39;ve rephrased several times now; what topics other than those related to Russia are labeled as &quot;Russian talking points&quot; and how do you identify them?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Shareblue had previously been a more legit news site called Blue Nation Review. But Brock&#39;s company bought it and transformed it into a propaganda machine after they already had CTR in full swing. I remember because I participated in a lot of Sanders groups at the time - it was a constant topic of conversation.</p>

<p>Do read those articles in full, but then go read about Russian disinformation too.</p>

<p>Since we&#39;re on the topic, there&#39;s always the classic (and nearly daily sumitted) <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4kHiUAjTvQ">Yuri Pill</a>. Is this not the apex of Russian propaganda exposed? </p>

<p>As I said, I&#39;m a child of the 80s. I&#39;ve seen this and now I&#39;m seeing it again, but I&#39;m not a child any more. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Russia or not, the DNC hack was about the contents of the emails (showing the dodgy relationships and collusion against Sanders), the hack was secondary. It would have been a good target, but if Clinton had better principles, she might have won.</p>

<p>I agree with this wholeheartedly, but I don&#39;t believe that&#39;s the accepted narrative. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Cause and effect. Step back and look at the big picture.</p>

<p>Republican partisan think tanks came of age in the 1960&#39;s. Democratic counterparts only started arriving in the 80&#39;s and 90&#39;s. Democratic propaganda is far behind and much smaller than Republican propaganda, and Republicans spend far more than Democrats because <em>Republicans want to deregulate the money machine and make money=speech</em>. They are not doing this for some ideological or altruistic reason. They are doing this because in the long run, they have more money and want to take advantage.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>CTR is defunct.  They shut down their website on 12/31/2016.  It was part of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Brock">David Brock&#39;s</a> media empire and only existed to help push pro Hillary propaganda on the internet.  Hillary lost so CTR shut down.  But Brock has plenty of organizations to take it&#39;s place; American Bridge 21st Century, CREW, Shareblue, Priorities USA Action, Media Matters, etc.</p>

<p>And I&#39;m sure that there are other organizations doing the same things, and have nothing to do with Brock.  CTR is often just a catch-all term for any left wing astroturfing.</p>
