<p>Suppose a really smart man had built a contraption in his shed, with heavy balls and a torsion balance, and told you that he could use this gizmo (plus some mathematical calculations) to determine the mass of the entire earth, what would you say?</p>

<p>Does this seem plausible to you?</p>

<p>What if he told you that he could also determine the mass of the moon, Mars, and every other object in the Solar System, using the same device in his shed?</p>

<p>What would you think then?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sure, it can be done to a reasonable approximation. I know a guy who attempted to replicate Cavendish’s device himself.

<p>A reasonable approximation of what? How can we corroborate the alleged mass of the earth?</p>

<p>A reasonable approximation of what?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The equations I referenced are descriptive, not prescriptive. They provide a formal framework for understanding certain observations about the natural world. </p>

<p>Mass is simply a term we use to describe variable resistance to acceleration. On planetary scales, this is observable in the orbital paths of large collections of matter such as the moon.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>How can we corroborate the alleged mass of the earth?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Again, mass is a term used to describe a universal property (resistance to acceleration). This acceleration is the sum total of gravitational forces (proportional to mass) of the bodies involved (moon-earth; earth-moon-sun; etc.).</p>

<p>We can corroborate these observations with our understanding of the volume and elemental composition of the planet, but this is less precise and ultimately a bit circular since we largely approximate elemental composition based on mass and volume.</p>

<p>More or less. You seem to rely heavily on the rhetorical technique of making what actually happened sound absurd. </p>

<p>Technically, anything we SEE is light. The moon and the sun are lights we see in the sky. They are clearly bodies with volume and mass. </p>

<p>I assume you are referring to point sources of light like stars and planets. You can buy a telescope and see that the less distant planets are in fact worlds of their own.</p>

<p>One line of evidence is orbital behavior. But that invokes gravity which you don&#39;t seem to believe in. </p>

<p>Another is spectroscopy. We can acquire data about atmospheric composition. Composition implying something composed of matter - not simply an ex-nihilo pinprick of light.</p>

<p>Today Cavendish’s experiment is viewed as a way to measure the universal gravitational constant G, rather than as a measurement of the density of Earth. Using updated measuring apparatus but the same basic setup, physics students and scientists today often perform Cavendish’s experiment, which is still recognized as one of the most elegant physics experiments of all time.</p>

<p>I did, then you move the goalposts that it has to be the exact same equpiment in the exact same scenario. </p>

<p>You havent been able to explain yourself as to how or why a slightly different mount or a different sized weight disprove the experiment. </p>

<p>Doesnt that fact that we can test this experiment show that at the very least its entirely possible?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s a problem because if its circular, both G and the mass of earth don&#39;t have to be accurate. </p>

<p>You can figure out your own weight in Newtons without using this equation. But this equation will solve for your weight in Newtons. So the reliability of both G and the weight of earth aren&#39;t contingent on their own accuracy. You could easily insert a different mass for the earth, find the new G, and the equation would still give you your weight in Newtons. </p>

<p>You don&#39;t see that as a potential problem, or why this equation might not be reliable in calculating info about celestial bodies? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>What I&#39;m saying is that you don&#39;t need the experiment at all. Cavendish was solving an unfinished equation set forth by Newton. Newton could not find G or the Mass of earth.  However, If one were to estimate the mass of earth, they would find G. </p>

<p>Manipulating one or the other, and then adjusting the other variable, still leaves you with a weight in Newtons, which can be solved with a more simple equation.   </p>

<p>So if the experiment isn&#39;t needed, as well as the experiment&#39;s accuracy being highly questionable (in my mind), I don&#39;t believe it was used for the solving for G and the mass of earth, and I want to see a true replica to prove he actually did the experiment.  </p>

<p>Honestly, Cavendish could have easily just estimated the mass of earth and found G and then lied and stated that he came up with an experiment that solved G.</p>

<p>This will probably make you think I&#39;m a loon (but what sub are we in?) but i also find it rather amusing that when you round to the first three digits G, it comes to 666. </p>

<p>The 666 number routinely comes up in a lot of other calculations, like the curvature of one mile squared, or the earth&#39;s tilt. </p>

<p>I am extremely interested in how organizations like the masons (which both Newton and Cavendish were a part of) are actively manipulating our world. And when most of the famous scientists of yesteryear were apart of this occult club, is that hard to surmise that they may have been making calculations to satisfy their own beliefs? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The funny thing about Cavendish&#39;s setup is that you get (an estimate of) G without considering the mass of the Earth. 
You can then do ball drops on Earth, and plug the measured force into Newtons again, isolating M to get Earth&#39;s mass. I don&#39;t get your confusion about this. It&#39;s simple formulas with few variables and high school math. </p>

<p>Assume for a moment that gravity works exactly how science says it does.... why would this experiment <em>not</em> work?</p>

<p>It seems to me that your only reason for implying this experiment is implausible is because you doubt the scientific explanation for gravity. But, I bet you can&#39;t explain <em>why</em> you doubt it.</p>

<p>I bet you can&#39;t suggest a viable alternative explanation for the phenomena observed. For example... why do objects fall towards the ground rather than up into the sky?</p>

<p>If you say it is because the ground is accelerating upwards, can you explain what force is causing the ground to accelerate upwards?</p>

<p>If that is <em>not</em> you explanation for the observed <em>fact</em> that objects with mass on earth fall towards the ground absent some force acting upon them, what <em>is</em> your explanation?</p>

<p>If you have no explanation, then why do you doubt the explanation science has offered - an explanation, I might add, that has enabled all sorts of advancements that confirm that the explanation is at least useful, if not 100% correct.</p>

<p>If you can&#39;t offer a useful alternative explanation, why should anyone listen to you?</p>

<p>Aren&#39;t you the one who dismisses people with &quot;You expect me to believe that?&quot; whenever they say something, not matter the topic, that doesn&#39;t fit your personal narrative? You seem to assume someone has an &quot;angle&quot; and you&#39;re the supreme skeptic. I am just calling it as I see it. Maybe you&#39;re just playing devil&#39;s advocate, but it doesn&#39;t come across that way to me, personally.</p>

<p>Am I wrong in saying you don&#39;t believe any wars have taken place? You don&#39;t believe dinosaurs, gravity, outer space, any of those things exist(ed)? You don&#39;t believe the Earth is a globe? You believe basically all of science is a deception, a religion? That mass shootings are all hoaxes...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No.  A smart man determined the gravitational constant using a torsion balance of masses.  The shed part isn&#39;t relevant.  To determine the mass of the earth, you need this constant, plus some other measurements.  So, no, the Cavendish experiment doesn&#39;t weight the earth.  It measures the strength of the force of gravity.</p>

<p>A reasonable approximation of what?</p>

<p>The equations I referenced are descriptive, not prescriptive. They provide a formal framework for understanding certain observations about the natural world. </p>

<p>Mass is simply a term we use to describe variable resistance to acceleration. On planetary scales, this is observable in the orbital paths of large collections of matter such as the moon.</p>

<p>How can we corroborate the alleged mass of the earth?</p>

<p>Again, mass is a term used to describe a universal property (resistance to acceleration). This acceleration is the sum total of gravitational forces (proportional to mass) of the bodies involved (moon-earth; earth-moon-sun; etc.).</p>

<p>We can corroborate these observations with our understanding of the volume and elemental composition of the planet, but this is less precise and ultimately a bit circular since we largely approximate elemental composition based on mass and volume.</p>
