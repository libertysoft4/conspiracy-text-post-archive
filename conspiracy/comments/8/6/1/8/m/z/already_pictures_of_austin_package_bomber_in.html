<p>Second edit : I’m a long time lurker, first time poster, so I apologize if my updates and edits aren’t the greatest. </p>

<p>For the sake of conversation and conspiracy I stumbled along this tweet from a local Austin New station report , KXAN News : <a href="https://twitter.com/AlyssaMGoard/status/976538774883749888?s=20">https://twitter.com/AlyssaMGoard/status/976538774883749888?s=20</a>
Granted they probably are being somewhat quiet on disclosing personal information, but interesting nonetheless! </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, he is dead. CBS Austin has already released the FedEx surveillance showing him delivering package bombs at their facility. This was within hours of him being identified. We have gone how many months without one single image of Stephen Paddock inside of a Las Vegas hotel. Not checking in, not carry luggage, not gambling....</p>

<p>Just trying to show the transparency between these two instances. I don’t feel like the Las Vegas shooting has nearly as much attention as it should and has been completely put on the back burner. I don’t know if I’d even say back burner, it’s an afterthought at this point. </p>

I just said I would love to hear their all-knowing opinions on how in this separate instance, an armed resource officer prevented what should have been prevented at their school.

    <div class="md"><p>Not angry at all, I enjoy having discussions but I also take a look at the entire scenario and not hone in on one specific aspect of this disaster. Have you not seen how many reports were made on this kid to local and federal law enforcement, by his peers, teachers, family members, etc? How much more prevention do you really need when you have red flags staring you in the face? I can’t really say how those kids feels and I’m sure it’s easy to point all kinds of blame in the haste of the moment. However, the townhall and the political agendas being pushed are what I find sickening. Mostly because I don’t actually believe it’s truly their own, informed opinions on this, but more what’s expected or encouraged to be said. That’s all. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Just to let you know, it&#39;s not all a CNN conspiracy, lots of people just actually agree with it.  Like me, I don&#39;t think it was a conspiracy and I think it&#39;s totally possible for a kid with a gun to march in a kill a bunch of children.  I also think we can&#39;t rely on armed security to respond everywhere and blame them when people are shot.</p>

<p>A lot of the legislation that&#39;s pushed has a hidden agenda but I struggle to follow the money with this one.  I think there are just more and more people coming onto my frame of mind that guns are to blame and we should take them away.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re asking the wrong person.  I&#39;d be open to seeing plans to resolve the current gun problems but I don&#39;t know how to make effective legislature.  The &quot;weaponry&quot; definition is shaky too, I don&#39;t oppose people owning shotguns and rifles and I&#39;m not anti hunting, I personally think semi-automatic guns in general are excessive especially handguns and have enabled most recent shootings but it&#39;s hard to draw a strict line.  However I feel like someone has to and semi-autos are a good place to start.</p>

<p>Those questions are for lawmakers really.  I&#39;m not an expert, I&#39;m just not a gun enthusiast and I&#39;m sick of other people&#39;s hobbies being treated as a sacred right when they are excessively dangerous.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Nah man, just wondering how people who are against “heavy weaponry” think that changing laws will actually work. Change laws to make these guns illegal, what about the millions of legal gun owners who own these types of guns now? Are they expecting us to voluntarily surrender our guns?

    <div class="md"><p>I am totally expecting you to voluntarily surrender them, just deal with owning something illegal.  I don&#39;t get why so much of the anti-gun control argument hinges around basic understanding of when something that was formally legal was made illegal.  There&#39;s usually a grace period, followed by varying degrees of enforcement.  Chances are the way it would work out in practice is that people would still own &quot;illegal&quot; guns in their home and no one would bother them until a crime was committed with one, same as with switchblades and brass knuckles. </p>

Your argument that just because people won&#39;t stop breaking the law doesn&#39;t mean we shouldn&#39;t make new laws is self-defeating. The only thing these new laws would do is make more people who were law-abiding gun owners (such as myself) into criminals. I struggle with your argument simply because by your own admission, you don&#39;t know much about guns. It seems that your only argument is that you don&#39;t like them, so no one should have them. I could say the same about video games or skinny jeans on men. I don&#39;t like them, so no one should have them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t really get the drug comment.  What do you mean by that? If you&#39;re saying drugs should be legal to cut down on crime I can sympathize, if you&#39;re saying something else I can&#39;t really follow your logic.</p>

<p>So you&#39;re saying you&#39;d become a criminal if the government banned a gun type you own?  Would you continue driving a car if it was deemed a risk to yourself or others?</p>

<p>I don&#39;t need to know about guns to have an opinion on their use and ownership.  I don&#39;t know anything about bombs, or knives, or any number of other dangerous banned items and I think my opinion is just as valid as bomb experts on the subject of whether or not they should be legal.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You said that it wasn&#39;t the end of the world when people didn&#39;t &quot;turn in their cocaine&quot;. It became an illegal industry that has caused many, MANY more deaths by gun violence than legal ownership of firearms. I do happen to think that drugs should be legal, if for no other reason than to stop the slaughter of people over the trafficking of drugs.</p>

<p>If a law was passed banning a firearm that I legally owned, until I turned it in I would be a criminal through absolutely no action of my own. Every time I get into my car, I am taking a calculated risk. I have no control over the actions of other drivers, only my own. In answer to your question, yes I would. I do so every day. To say that cars are risky so no one should drive is ludicrous. </p>

<p>Your opinion is your opinion. Unless you did the research on how bombs or mechanical knives are constructed, and weighed the evidence on their use and/or misuse, you are just taking someone elses word on the matter, and I am fairly certain that you would discount the opinion of someone who does not share the same view as you, as you are doing here. 
Unfortunately for you, this is a right that is specified in the Constitution, just like freedom of speech, freedom from unlawful search and seizure, and the others. There is a way to amend the Constitution. Passing laws to neuter it is a coward&#39;s way. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re right, I was being a dick.  I interpreted what you said as insulting for some reason but it wasn&#39;t at all.</p>

<p>We already infringe on the right to bear arms in a thousand ways with special concealed carry permits, automatic bans, and tons of other ways.  So saying it&#39;s constitutionally protected doesn&#39;t mean a whole lot, we can interpret that as rocket launchers should be legal but we choose not to.  I don&#39;t support an outright ban but anything less would still fit under our current interpretation.</p>

<p>Really this is just a fundamental difference of opinion and we&#39;re not going to convince each other.  You have something you like that you want to keep, and I think it&#39;s dangerous and don&#39;t think it&#39;s necessary.  These are both loose arguments that can and have been overridden before in laws, it&#39;s really just down to where public opinion leans.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You get these responses bc no one can take you seriously. </p>

<p>And I don&#39;t feel like you are on the logic side vs emotion.   Your emotion is driving you to throw ideas at the wall to see what sticks. Logic would dictate you actually look into the facts and come.up with a reasonable solution.  As for your opposition, they don&#39;t believe throwing out the Constitution and taking guns out of the hands of law abiding citizens will make people safer. Examples being de-armed Germany, China ect. </p>

<p>I strongly believe you should also note the reasoning the Japanese did not try to invade the US.  Behind every blade of grass there is a rifle. </p>

<p>Personally I believe there can be a discussion on this. But I&#39;m.not going to give away where I able to flex bc that will be taken as an opportunity to start deteriorating the 2nd. Make reasonable suggestions and you can get reasonable conversation.    Removing the millions if not hundreds of millions of semi automatic weapons  from the popilace isn&#39;t a solution.  That will just make a huge black market. And everyone will be making good money off selling the extra guns and you&#39;ll be sitting cashless and gunless. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Honestly the point of the post wasn&#39;t to spark a gun control debate, it was to let y&#39;all in the echo chamber know that people with this opinion exist, are in fact common, and are not being paid by any shadow organization.</p>

<p>You can try to dismiss it as completely insane but more and more people in the US are in support of a blanket semi-auto ban.  I do think the black market point is an issue and I need to look into that more, but I&#39;m not in charge of a solution anyway.</p>

<p>And I&#39;m already cashless and gunless so I&#39;m not too worried about that.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ll just give you some of our Founding Fathers&#39; thoughts on it...  </p>

<p>&quot;A free people ought not only to be armed, but disciplined...&quot; - Thomas Jefferson  </p>

<p>&quot;No free man shall ever be debarred the use of arms.&quot; - Thomas Jefferson  </p>

<p>&quot;I prefer dangerous freedom over peaceful slavery.&quot; - Thomas Jefferson  </p>

<p>“They that can give up essential liberty to obtain a little temporary safety deserve neither liberty nor safety.&quot; - Benjamin Franklin  </p>

<p>&quot;To disarm the people...[i]s the most effectual way to enslave them.&quot; - George Mason  </p>

<p>Never forget that those people controlling the government drones and police gear are citizens of the United States first. They are serving US, not our government. So yes, 330M Americans (give or take for young children and elderly/sick) armed to the fucking teeth is exactly why we are still free. Our government (especially over the last 25 years) hasn&#39;t just <em>given us</em> our freedom because they want to be nice people. They are slowly siphoning it away, and people like you are the pawns they need to complete the job.  </p>

<p>So give up your gun willingly, and I hope that <em>IF</em> a revolt ever happens, you side with out government. It won&#39;t be pretty, because it never has been in the past. <em>We The People</em> have always prevailed, and we always will.</p>

<p>Private donations only make about a quarter of the funding for the NRA. The rest is corporate dollars. Why don&#39;t you try following the money?</p>

<p>I’m assuming your point here is that something something abortion = murder and I’d like to remind you that the scientific community overwhelmingly disagrees. Now while I’ll agree that this alone does not completely invalidate the pro-life position, it does however make it a rather silly claim to drag into an argument about something entirely unrelated. </p>

<p>Since you’re here and your username is a pun on Goldman Sachs I’m gonna assume you’re rightfully skeptical when big banks funnel money into NGOs and buy politicans. Why do you give the NRA a pass for doing the exact same thing? It’s peak intellectual dishonesty.</p>

<p>This is not my point, no, but this would be my opinion. I&#39;m a &quot;pro-choicer&quot; (freedom rings, mother fucker), but that doesn&#39;t mean that <em>I personally</em> support women/couples getting abortions, <strong>especially if it is on the taxpayer&#39;s dime</strong>. At what point do we just call it population control?  </p>

<blockquote>

<p>That is absolutely correct. I work in the financial services too, by the way.  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Why do you give the gun industry and the NRA a pass for doing the exact same thing? It’s peak intellectual dishonesty.  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>I never said this and I do not give either a pass for doing it. But going after <em>We The People&#39;s</em> guns because the NRA/gun industry lobbies (for the Republicans) isn&#39;t the right thing to do either and it&#39;s not going to solve the issues at hand.   </p>

<p>The Democrats and MSM wouldn&#39;t be threatening gun legislation if the NRA/gun lobby were in <em>their</em> pockets.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Convinced people that they care about the Constitution? What the hell are they teaching kids in school these days? The Constitution, by definition, is <em>a body of fundamental principles or established precedents according to which a state or other organization is acknowledged to be governed.</em> What the fuck do you mean the that the only reason people care about this is because of NRA propaganda? Have you ever even read the Preamble of our Constitution (assuming you&#39;re American)?  </p>

<p>My point about abortions is you can regurgitate the hit phrase &quot;one child too many&quot; all you want, but it&#39;s tired. &quot;The boy who cried wolf.&quot; Fatal gun and car accidents in 2018 is a fraction of the number of drug overdose fatalities in 2018 <strong>so far</strong>. Combine all three and it&#39;s still a fraction of the amount of abortions that have taken place <strong>ALREADY</strong> in 2018. Guns have been around since before your great-grandparents, and gun deaths are actually hovering around all time lows right now (most of which are from suicides and gang related activities, but I would have to do some more research on this before I established it as fact). What is a fact, is that school shooting fatalities aren&#39;t even a blip on the radar.  </p>

<p>Until you come back to me with numbers, facts, sources, or anything really besides some regurgitated Reddit posts, you really have nothing to offer this conversation other than your opinion, which is rather meaningless when it comes to legislation and human nature.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree completely.</p>

<p>A point I like to raise on this topic is that even if you&#39;re a student in a school with <em>an active shooter</em>, you&#39;re statistically <em>very</em> likely to survive. The likelihood of any random student being murdered at school is vanishingly small.</p>

<p>To be honest, I haven&#39;t looked at the numbers, but I suspect more students die annually by their own hand (suicide), or while traveling to and from school, than in school shootings.</p>

<p>None of this is to say that we should do <em>nothing</em> about school shootings, but the response seems like an overreaction based on the cold hard facts.</p>

<p>The arms deal angle has made the most sense to me from what I&#39;ve looked into. Paddock doesn&#39;t fit the MO of a mass shooter to me at all. He seemed like the kind of guy that just wanted to coast and enjoy everything he&#39;d worked for.

    <div class="md"><p>The amount of weapons and the way they were displayed lends credence to the arms deal angle to me. Seems like the kind of guy that could definitely get involved in those circles, having an in through the defense contractor job. Which I believe he really only worked for a few years way back in the 80&#39;s before moving onto real estate. </p>

<p>He could just be a gambler with a grudge and some debt that snapped but if that&#39;s the case why no transparency? It reminds me of the Russian investigation, if there is nothing there why act weird as fuck about it? lol </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Being a defense contractor doesn&#39;t really open the door to being an illicit gun trafficker. If he was a former CIA/FBI agent, sure.

<p>Personally I make the jump because he was found with a bullet in his head in a room filled with guns.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Fair enough, and you could very well be 100% correct. </p>

<p>I would like to see some video of him bringing in the weapons or pretty much anything proving he was in there acting alone. I think some information being made public would go a long way to ease some of the speculation.  </p>

<p>Here is the information I was referring to FWIW:</p>

<p>They believe he is the head of security at The Tropicana, his name is Jason Buff. He posted on facebook about it <a href="https://i.redd.it/1shirw0ixnwz.jpg">here</a>. He claims it&#39;s him in the video and explains the situation. </p>

<p><a href="https://tobefree.wordpress.com/2017/11/16/hd-video-man-escorted-out-of-tropicana-is-not-prince-salman-but-this-security-guard/">Here</a> is a wordpress page with some links to some decent pictures and a breakdown of the information. </p>

<p>If you google Jason Buff much more information comes up with decent pictures of what seems to be a similar softball uniform and cleats.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Isaac Figueroa, 26, said he and his brother heard sirens and helicopters early Wednesday in the area and drove toward them, then cut through nearby woods on foot after they hit a police roadblock. Figueroa said they saw a silver or gray Jeep Cherokee that was pinned between black and white vehicles and &quot;looked like it had been rammed off the road.&quot; He said he saw police deploy a robot to go examine the Jeep.</p>

<li>As SWAT officers approached the suspect&#39;s vehicle, the suspect detonated a bomb inside it, killing himself. A SWAT officer, an 11-year veteran of the APD, fired on the suspect. That officer is now on administrative leave.</li>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;Police zeroed in on Conditt EARLIER IN THE WEEK and located his vehicle at a hotel on Interstate 35 in the suburb of Round Rock. Officers were WAITING FOR ARMORED VEHICLES to arrive before moving in for an arrest when HIS VEHICLE BEGAN TO DRIVE AWAY, Austin Police Chief Brian Manley said at a news conference.&quot;</p>

<p>1.) So, it took DAYS for &quot;ARMORED VEHICLES&quot; to arrive on the scene?! (I thought every small town now had a fleet of surplus army MRAPs ready to close in on any dime bag dealer identified by the local fusion center within minutes of AI orders.</p>

<p>2.) Is this another case of death(s) by SELF-DRIVING CAR? Did another autonomous vehicle decide to &#39;one-up&#39; the #KillerUber in Arizona by delivering package-bombs? Was it an Autonomous Amazon Automobile making deliveries? Was it KITT dropping street-mines?! Seriously, how does a serial-bomber go from his hotel room to his car and drive away when it&#39;s all been surrounded by SWAT since &quot;earlier in the week&quot;? Aren&#39;t these guys now trained (((in Israel))) to put 100 rounds (minimum) into kids holding Xbox controllers on their porch if so much as a cricket chirps?? (but serial bombers and church mass shooters get the kinder, gentler machine gun hand?!)</p>

<p>FedEx bomber: The FedEx bomber is at large and his identity is unknown. In this case law enforcement publicly releases a select set of photos and possible videos as part of a public appeal to ascertain the identity of the suspect. </p>

<p>Paddock: In this case law enforcement knew the suspect&#39;s location. There was no need to appeal to the public for an identity because before law enforcement could even acquire camera footage the guy was already dead. </p>

<p>In the Paddock case (and other similar cases) the only ways to get the footage is through FOIA of local/state/federla law enforcement (which is usually denied due to active investigations. Just because the guy is dead doens&#39;t mean the investigation is over), or through releases in open court. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>He brought more in himself than I would have guessed. Nothing contradicts the story that they’ve revealed, but the delay is suspect. The story changed  many times in the first week. The sherif’s first reporting differs from all subsequent updates given to the press. It looks more like an arm deal gone wrong. You don’t need that many guns to do what he did. Why the huge delay between bursts if he had 20 guns all preloaded with mags. They didn’t all have bump stocks. It looked more like he was showing someone his merchandise. Have you heard that theory?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah the changing story is certainly interesting.  Yeah I have heard about the arms deal, but I dunno, seems a little fishy, too.  Do you think the deal was for more sophisticated arms than AR-15s?  Those are pretty easy to get (I built mine in 45 minutes(legally)), so I don&#39;t know why a covert arms deal in a hotel room would be necessary.  The trunk of a car in the desert seems like a much better option haha!  That&#39;s how I&#39;d do it.  I think all we&#39;ve seen is ARs, right?  Is he shooting out of the window in an effort to demonstrate the firearms?  That seems... uncecessary.... I haven&#39;t watched the footage in a while, how long was the delay between bursts?</p>
