        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Outcome A: Trump is found guilty (whatever that means), and is forced out somehow, or somehow stay in power anyway. Either way, we will still be governed by a system which is corrupt to its very core. Our government will still not serve the people. The CIA and others will still be largely unaccountable to the elected government, and completely unaccountable to the people. The MIC, financial industry, tech sector, and pharma will still dominate our lives in ever-increasing ways. Victims of all types still won&#39;t have justice; we won&#39;t have justice. Or:</p>

<p>Outcome B: Trump is found not guilty (whatever that means). Unless you really trust Trump. I mean really trust him, not just a &quot;better than Clinton&quot; kind of trust, but think he&#39;s a game-changer president, then everything I wrote for Outcome A still applies. We still have a government and corporations who abuse us. </p>

<p>The only way the outcome of Trump/Russia matters is if you really, truly trust the government, either with or without Trump in it. There&#39;s a few people I might trust with changing things, <em>might</em>, but none of their names have ever been uttered in the same breath as President of the United States. I think it&#39;s absurd to trust anyone from these dens of jackals. </p>

<p>And if I&#39;m right in that, then the Trump/Russia story is one of the most important phenomena in recent memory, but not because the outcome matters a lick. It&#39;s so important because it has squarely set two parts of the country into living in two different realities. People on each side are becoming so emotionally invested in that reality, that I don&#39;t think someone who believes it&#39;s true can ever recognize the reality of the person who thinks its false, and vice versa. Most of the country, and much of the world, are dividing into two reality bubbles that can&#39;t understand each other. </p>

<p>I think the Trump/Russia story is one of the most well executed divide-and-conquer campaigns ever undertaken. It has all the pieces: Republicans vs. Democrats, the American people vs the government, the American people vs Russia, etc. And the worst part may be, we might not even get an outcome that definitively picks Outcome A or Outcome B. It might be more or less undetermined; many people will stick to their side, and still not be able to understand the other. </p>

<p>It doesn&#39;t even matter who orchestrated this: Putin, CIA, DNC, &quot;the deep state,&quot; the Bilderberger Group, the Vatican, some unknown group, or any or all of the above. Who set this in motion or perpetuated it makes no difference, and what the outcome eventually is, or appears to be, makes no difference. But,</p>

<p>Deciding whether you think the outcome matters, and whether or not you should give it your attention as if it matters, <em>is</em> important, precisely because it only has the power to divide us if we, individually and collectively, give it that power. </p>

<p>Could you please explain exactly what you mean by &quot;concerned about&quot;? </p>

<p>Sure. </p>

<p>Normally elections are free and fair. Colluding with a foreign country is not normal. To be concerned with it means to find some relevance in it (&quot;this issue is of  <em>concern</em> to me&quot;). Concern is associated with negative feelings such as worry, anxiety and distress. </p>

<p>If one is &quot;concerned about&quot; Russian collusion it means it is of interest and some worry that Russia colluded with the Trump campaign.</p>

<p>I would probably debate this, at least from a philosophical perspective, and maybe on an election fraud level as well. But even if the actual process of the election is fair as it is described, it does not actually constitute a government that represents the people, but one that serves corporate and wealthy interests first. </p>

<p>I do not hold that the Russian collusion allegations, even if true to some of the largest claims, represent an actual departure from normal. The elections and governments are still determined by people and institutions that are not the American people, and it doesn&#39;t matter to me whether that means a Russian strongman, executives at Chase, or our own intelligence agencies. </p>

<p>Fair enough. </p>

<p>Yes, I&#39;d agree that you can hold those both in your mind. My specific point is that if one group of people holds steadfastly that there was collusion, and another group holds steadfastly that there was not, these two groups are not going to be able to hold a <em>shared</em> understanding that the government is inherently corrupt. </p>

<p>They will understand that separately, but they will not be able communicate or organize how to address that corruption. If the Trump supporters think that Trump running the country and &quot;draining the swamp&quot; is the only way to solve it, and the anti-Trumpers think that removing Trump is the only way to solve it, then there can be no path forward in addressing the underlying corruption that both sides could possibly agree to. While their stated goals are the same, reducing or eliminating corruption, their plans on how to achieve that are diametrically opposed and fundamentally incompatible. </p>

<p>This is the nature of the two part system, it is inheritly divisive. People chose their team and they then must win, there is little room for debate once people have hung their flag. </p>

<p>Yeah this is a problem but I don&#39;t think it is of benefit to either team red or team blue to dismiss Russian collusion as an irrelevance simply because the two party system is corrupt.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know what the solution is but a depolarisation of politics is long over due. A centrist conservative party wouldn&#39;t be losing special elections to resurgent dems. </p>

<p>To me, it&#39;s not two countrymen. Two countrymen implies that the conflict is among equals, but it&#39;s not among equals. A single citizen, or even often times organized individuals, do not have the same power in determining how our government functions as businesses and the wealthy. <a href="https://scholar.princeton.edu/sites/default/files/mgilens/files/gilens_and_page_2014_-testing_theories_of_american_politics.doc.pdf">Gilens and Page study on policy preferences vs outcomes across business/wealthy/majoritarian groups</a> [PDF].</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Again, agreed! </p>

<p>It seems that perhaps a reformation of campaign law regarding their transparency is one step we could purse on the path to truly representative governance. Also Citizens United must be examined. </p>

<p>In the meantime things like gerrymandering and voter disenfranchisement are things &quot;we&quot; can tackle now. </p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>And maybe not even that, really. It&#39;s not that I don&#39;t think it&#39;s important, it&#39;s that I think it&#39;s importance is being vastly played up to the point of pushing other aspects of corruption and potential reforms out of the conversation, and reducing the chances that we can build any consensus on these reforms. </p>

<p>I think this country taking steps to reverse Citizens United, decrease gerrymandering, and decrease disenfranchisement would all be reforms that would have more of an impact on systemic corruption than whatever the Democrats eventually implement regarding Trump/Russia when they regain power. I think these reforms are also more widely agreed upon by voters all across the spectrum (CU at least), and could go a long way towards addressing the more deeply-seated corruption in our government. </p>

<p>We should tackle these reforms, and I think many Americans want to, but in the current climate, few individuals, and even fewer politicians, are willing to reach across these artificial party lines. Many (not all) people who want Trump gone are actively demonizing anyone who voted for him, or who still support him, and vice versa. It has become less a political disagreement among citizens of a common nation, but an ever-more personal hostility between members of different tribes. This did not begin in 2016, far from it, but it has been exacerbated enormously. </p>

<p>It&#39;s that hostility and inability to work together that I&#39;m most concerned about. According to one version of the Trump/Russia narrative, Russia&#39;s goal was to &quot;sow discord.&quot; Whether or not Russia was behind that, I think it&#39;s safe to say it worked. And if that was their goal, I think he have to consider whether putting our focus on Trump and Russia — two incredibly divisive issues — is going to heal that discord or heighten it. I think what&#39;s needed is an increased focus on trying to understand each other, really understand each other, and come together on at least those things where we can. </p>

I think what would be just as profitable for those who would benefit from a hot civil war, and more likely in the short term, would be a low, steady, and perpetual &quot;cold&quot; civil war; a growing sense of inter-tribal hostility and animosity amongst an increasingly divided country.  </p>

<p>And the worst part may be, we might not even get an outcome that definitively picks Outcome A or Outcome B. It might be more or less undetermined</p>

<p>The worst possible scenario.  Imagine after all this investigating Mueller pulls a Comey and lists off every sketchy thing Trump did that appears to cross the line into criminality and then concludes that no prosecutor would pursue charges because Trump didn&#39;t have the requisite mens rea and he was only moderately negligent instead of grossly negligent and that&#39;s the end of it.</p>

<p>It would cause a full blown meltdown.</p>
