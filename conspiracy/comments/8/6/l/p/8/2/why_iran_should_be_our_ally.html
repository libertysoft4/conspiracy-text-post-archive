<p>Pretty sure that exact same argument was used to justify war with Iraq, Afghanistan, Vietnam, and every other country we&#39;ve ever invaded. Doesn&#39;t that sound a little too flag-waving &#39;Murican for this subreddit? </p>

<p>To quote my favorite movie: &quot;We are here to help the Vietnamese, because inside every gook there is an American trying to get out. It&#39;d a hardball world, son. We&#39;ve gotta keep our heads until this peace craze blows over.&quot; </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Didn&#39;t you follow the Iranian protests in january? Where there were women, removing their hijabs in defiance of power? There were massive protests and some deaths which ultimately made the protests die down.</p>

<p>There were some police officers and others joining the protest etc etc</p>

<p>Sure it&#39;s one of those &quot;propaganda lines&quot; they use all the time, but if facts back it up, I dunno mate, I wish the Iranians a brighter future. One like those pics from the 70s</p>

<p>Even Saudi Arabia is like, yeah we could remove the hijab and all that jazz perhaps! He&#39;s already said, them being black only as retarded lol</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Huh, that would actually make some sense. It&#39;d be an interesting shift in power with Saudi Arabia actually leading the fights in the Middle East themselves. It would also explain the massive arms deals we have been making with them. I can&#39;t really say I like the idea of this war no matter who is involved in it, but I would definitely prefer it <em>not</em> be our citizens dying over there. </p>

<p>I have hippy parents who actually lived in Iran, while my mother wrote a book. My sister has a funny name because she was born in the Middle East when they were traveling. They tell me Iran then was liberal, open society. Unlike other parts of the ME, she didn&#39;t have to cover up. Both of them saw this with their own eyes. When I go over for dinner and watch the news with them, their perspective is eye opening. I wish more Americans knew about this. </p>

<p>America fucked up their democracy. We created this monster. Currently, our so called ally, Saudi Arabia, is responsible for the spread of extremism in the ME with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wahhabism">their Wahhabism</a>.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Actually this whole &quot;death to America&quot; thing is not to be taken so seriously. </p>

<p>In Iranian &quot;death to X&quot; doesn&#39;t mean that the person uttering this figure of speech, actually wishes that someone dies. It is just that, a figure of speech. </p>

<p>The equivalent of saying this in the US would be &quot;Damn X&quot;. If two friends are drinking in a bar, and friend A spills friend B&#39;s beer, could one imagine that friend B says &quot;Damn you friend A!&quot;, I believe the answer is yes. Could one also believe that friend B doesn&#39;t actually wish friend A to suffer damnation and be burned in the fires of hell for an eternity? I believe the answer is yes.</p>

<p>So please keep this in mind, when talking about &quot;Death to America&quot;. I believe that can help individuals to avoid unnecesary scares in regards to Iranians, which by the way are extremely curious and it is deeply integrated in their culture, to be very hospitable.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Iranian/American here I don&#39;t trust any current government, wars are stupid and we should be allies with everyone but yeah our governments need their wars... </p>

<p>You keep saying &#39;we are the ones who did this or that&#39;, no man. You didn&#39;t do anything and certain people in governments need to be held accountable for their actions against humanity. Just be with moral people and try to fight the system by bettering your own life and helping others, don&#39;t think there&#39;s any huge gain in playing the politics game cuz it&#39;s rigged from the foundation.   </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Actually we gave them a fake a democracy and they replaced it with a real authoritarian theocracy, however when you look around, that seems to be the only way to prevent a financial empire occupation... Otherwise i would agree, they are fine people, certainly much more civilized than some of our allies (vassal is a better term when you&#39;re talking US friends, except for one of course)</p>
