        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Let&#39;s observe the comments/vote totals on 5 of my posts from yesterday:</p>

<ol>
<li><p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/86c7wu/blood_of_thousands_on_their_hands_55_senators/">Blood of Thousands on Their Hands: 55 Senators Vote to Continue US-Backed Carnage in Yemen.</a></p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/86cb7l/the_us_military_is_making_lasers_that_create/">The US Military Is Making Lasers That Create Voices out of Thin Air: If they are just admitting this now, this technology has likely already been around for a <em>long</em> time.</a></p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/86c4nl/the_russians_are_tweeting_the_russians_are/">The Russians are tweeting! The Russians are tweeting! Based on their hysterical statements, all taken from the same CIA talking points, one would think that the otherwise placid state of Wisconsin had fallen under virtual Russian control.</a></p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/86c2t8/newspeak_101_google_sets_up_news_initiative_to/">Newspeak 101: Google sets up “news initiative” to censor political opposition and promote mainstream media</a></p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/86ccif/the_head_of_the_salisbury_district_hospital/">The head of the Salisbury District Hospital emergency room admits that &quot;...no patients have experienced symptoms of nerve agent poisoning in Salisbury.&quot; It&#39;s high time for Britain to come clean.</a></p></li>
</ol>

<p>Now, the first obvious difference is that the first two links received hundreds of upvotes, and the last 3 were buried to 0 and show <em>very</em> unusual voting patterns.</p>

<p>The first two links are currently at 145 points (80% upvoted) and 174 points (85% upvoted), which is a respectable (and completely normal) vote count for conspiratorial subject manner on this sub.</p>

<p>The first important distinction between the successful posts and the buried ones is the subject matter. In the cases of the successful posts, they are questioning the military industrial complex...a uniting rallying cry for practically all conspiracy theorists.</p>

<p>These topics, although &quot;fringe&quot; like the &quot;voice of god&quot; technology, are accessible and less controversial, so they often don&#39;t trigger the &quot;bad actors&quot; to come and disrupt the sub.</p>

<p>Now, let&#39;s look at the other 3 links...you&#39;ll find a <em>very</em> different discussion (or lack thereof) with <em>extremely</em> unusual voting patterns.</p>

<p>In the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/86c4nl/the_russians_are_tweeting_the_russians_are/">first example</a>, the post is at 0 points and 46% upvoted. </p>

<p>Check the /new queue...many posts of lower quality routinely are buried to 0...<em>but</em>, and here&#39;s the rub, the comments will show similar voting patterns (karma scores of around -5 to +5).</p>

<p>However, in this example, despite being the <em>only</em> person to actually participate in that thread, my two comments are sitting at -6 and -28.</p>

<p>Why the discrepancy between the two comments? <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/TopMindsOfReddit/comments/86cnak/toppest_mind_axo_multiple_blatant_alts_cant/">The -28 comment was linked by</a> TMOR (Top Minds of Reddit...a hate/harassment sub for the uninitiated).</p>

<p>To reiterate, I defy anyone to find a post that ended with 0 points after a day, with <em>only</em> comments from OP, where <em>any</em> of the comments have been downvoted to -30.</p>

<p>There is a <em>direct</em> correlation between TMOR linking to this thread, and the subsequent barrage of downvotes.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/86c2t8/newspeak_101_google_sets_up_news_initiative_to/">They did it to this thread too</a>, which is currently sitting at 0 points and 48% upvoted.</p>

<p>You&#39;ll notice that my submission statement is sitting at -14, despite not receiving a single reply.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/TopMindsOfReddit/comments/86gwm5/topmod_still_blissfully_unaware_that_any_mentions/">Here&#39;s the post from TMOR that targeted this thread</a>. Note the lack of &quot;np&quot; (which makes brigading that much easier).</p>

<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/86ccif/the_head_of_the_salisbury_district_hospital/">The final example</a> wasn&#39;t <em>directly</em> linked by TMOR, but with all the attention directed at my posts yesterday, it&#39;s not surprising that this thread was hit too. It&#39;s entirely possible that they are using Discord (or another service outside of reddit) to coordinate these brigades as well.</p>

<p>Despite hitting 0 points (47% upvoted), my submission statement was buried to below -30 points. Similarly, every comment in that thread (and the thread itself) was being reported for rule violations (despite not breaking any rules...abuse of the report button is one of their new &quot;tactics&quot; to overwhelm and intimidate the mods).</p>

<p>In this case, however, there was a user who was kind (and polite) enough to offer a dissenting opinion (which is what <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> is all about, after all!).</p>

<p>However, even <em>that</em> user later edited their comment to point out the obvious fuckery talking place:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Edit: Stop upvoting me unless you also contribute to the conversation. Me and OP don&#39;t always see eye to eye but this brigading is getting out of control. He/she doesn&#39;t deserve it and neither do I.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I have to say, it&#39;s actually kind of refreshing to hear that even one of the <em>beneficiaries</em> of the brigading is getting sick of it.</p>

<p>I no longer feel compelled to take this info to the reddit admins, as they apparently aren&#39;t concerned by the extreme level of targeted harassment originating from TMOR and other hate subs on their site. </p>

<p>However, I <em>will</em> continue to document it for those who are paying attention.</p>

<p>I think one of the most important takeaways from this analysis is for us to note <em>which</em> topics seem to arouse the ire of the brigaders. <em>These</em> are often the topics that &quot;they&#39;ve&quot; deemed to be taboo, and this should encourage us to keep at it!</p>

<p>Much love!</p>

<p>Also totally off-topic, but your username struck me. I had a dream during a nap yesterday in which I was taking care of these lizard or salamander things that had a name loke xoxtl or close to that. They had big triangular heads and were brightly colored. I can&#39;t seem to find them online but I&#39;m convinced they are a real thing. Do you know?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yep. I&#39;m also a moderator in the TMOR discord. Since I&#39;m not splitting up my posts and can talk about two subjects in one line, personally I subscribe to the notion that Tom DeLonge either was actually abducted by aliens or underwent an experience that made him think he was before forming Angels and Airwaves, that the Quds Force is actually behind a large proportion of attacks on US and US-backed forces in Syria, and that Russia and China are both leveraging overt and covert assets to push the United States back from its role as world leader with the intent to expand their own power in the vacuum.</p>

The brigade of downvotes on everyone&#39;s supportive comments in this thread supports your astute diagnosis of the TMOR viral infection of this sub. The fact that they care so much about those who post quality content and informative analysis in this sub and invest so much effort to control the content and narratives in this sub is proof of the investigative potency and exposure of the truth by those of you who make this sub worth following by so many of us who are listening.

    <div class="md"><p>thank you for many quality posts.</p>

<p>One quick warning - replies that start like this should not be trusted:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I didn&#39;t downvote you, but ... [heavy gaslighting follows]</p>
</blockquote>

<p>They are part of an easily identifiable method that tends to appear in discussions that matter to the pentagon/intelligence-apparatus.</p>

<p>The &#39;method&#39; is to deliver a stern rejection of your argument and hide it from general view using massive downvotes. THEN, present a friendly voice, which will nonetheless urge you to rethink your position. </p>

<p>They always start with &quot;I didn&#39;t downvote you but...&quot;</p>

<p>which makes it comically easy to recognize. 
It was used frequently in r/worldnews at the height of the carnage in Iraq. Both funny and sad to see it repeated here. </p>

<p>Btw. this &#39;humble&#39; edit (below) is utter slime. His Ntrepid-sockpuppets shower him in upvotes while he pretends he doesn&#39;t want them. Just another trick to make you question yourself. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Edit: Stop upvoting me unless you also contribute to the conversation. Me and OP don&#39;t always see eye to eye but this brigading is getting out of control. He/she doesn&#39;t deserve it and neither do I.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Why is essentially a troll subreddit even allowed at Reddit? A subreddit devoted solely to poking fun and trolling other subreddit&#39;s is fine? It should be against Reddit rules. If so many people can get up in arms about the_donald trolling then why give passes to what is <em>actually</em> a troll subreddit?</p>

<p>We conspiracy users need to petition Reddit to BAN subreddits like these.  </p>
