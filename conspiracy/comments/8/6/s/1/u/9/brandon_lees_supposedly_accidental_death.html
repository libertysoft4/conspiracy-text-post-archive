        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I&#39;ll post excerpts from the Wikipedia article and reply to those:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Lee died of a gunshot wound on March 31, 1993 in Wilmington, North Carolina, at the age of 28, after an accidental shooting on set of The Crow.[7]</p>

<p>In the scene in which Lee was accidentally shot, Lee’s character walks into his apartment and discovers his fiancée being beaten and raped by thugs. Actor Michael Massee&#39;s character fires a .44 Magnum revolver at Lee as he walks into the room.[8] A previous scene using the same gun had called for inert dummy cartridges fitted with bullets (but no powder or percussion primer) to be loaded in the revolver for a close-up scene; for film scenes which utilize a revolver (where the bullets are visible from the front) and do not require the gun to actually be fired, dummy cartridges provide the realistic appearance of actual rounds. Instead of purchasing commercial dummy cartridges, the film&#39;s prop crew created their own by pulling the bullets from live rounds, dumping the powder charge then reinserting the bullets. However, they unknowingly or unintentionally left the live percussion primer in place at the rear of the cartridge.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Highly dubious. Anyone who knows how to disassemble and reassemble a cartridge to make dummy rounds can be assumed to have a certain amount of knowledge about how they work. They need specialized equipment to do it, such as a &quot;bullet puller&quot; (<a href="https://www.midwayusa.com/product/685703/rcbs-powr-pull-impact-bullet-puller-kit">https://www.midwayusa.com/product/685703/rcbs-powr-pull-impact-bullet-puller-kit</a>) or a reloading press. It can be done with a reloading press and a pair of Vise-Grips, but you will mangle the soft lead bullet (sometimes jacketed, fully or partially, with a thin layer of copper, which is also relatively soft) this way, due to having to grip it tightly with the serrated steel jaws of the Vise-Grips. </p>

<p>To put it back together, you need to use a reloading press and a suitable die to flare the case mouth to accept the reinsertion of the bullet (which, on .44 Magnum or Special cartridges, is roll-crimped into the bullet you just removed), and to press it into the case.</p>

<p>Anyone who knows how to use reloading equipment is going to know that you obviously don&#39;t leave the primer in the case when making a dummy cartridge. You either remove the primer (a set of reloading dies contains a die specifically for doing that) and leave the primer pocket empty, or you use a spent primer.    </p>

<blockquote>
<p>At some point during filming the revolver was apparently discharged with one of these improperly-deactivated cartridges in the chamber, setting off the primer with enough force to drive the bullet partway into the barrel, where it became stuck (a condition known as a squib load). The prop crew either failed to notice this or failed to recognize the significance of this issue.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Also highly dubious. If you fire a .44 Magnum or Special cartridge in a revolver which has a primer but no powder, it will almost certainly lock the revolver up, because a primer alone doesn&#39;t have enough power to push a heavy .44 bullet fully into the barrel, which leaves it jammed in between the cylinder&#39;s chamber and the forcing cone. The cylinder&#39;s chamber throats, the forcing cone, and the barrel&#39;s bore are all smaller in diameter than the bullet, so it takes a lot of force to push it through there. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>In the fatal scene, which called for the revolver to be actually fired at Lee from a distance of 3.6 - 4.5 meters (12–15 feet), the dummy cartridges were exchanged with blank rounds, which feature a live powder charge and primer, but no bullet, thus allowing the gun to be fired without the risk of an actual projectile. But since the bullet from the dummy round was already trapped in the barrel, this caused the .44 Magnum bullet to be fired out of the barrel with virtually the same force as if the gun had been loaded with a live round, and it struck Lee in the abdomen, mortally wounding him.[9]</p>
</blockquote>

<p>See above. In all likelihood the revolver would have been locked up due to the bullet being stuck between the chamber throat and the forcing cone. That means you can&#39;t then load a blank into it, because you can&#39;t open the cylinder to do so, nor can the trigger be pulled / hammer be cocked. Before you could do anything with that revolver aside from using it as a paper weight, you&#39;d have to pound the bullet back into the cylinder&#39;s chamber using a rod inserted down through the bore and a hammer; not fun, considering how tight it is in there and the fact that there is an empty case in the chamber which will be in the way. And of course, once you&#39;ve cleared the jam so that you can load blanks, the revolver will no longer have a bullet stuck in it, thus it will be safe to use with blanks.</p>

<p>So, in order for that incident to have been an accident, the following three highly unlikely things had to happen:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Someone who knows how to use reloading equipment left a primer in a dummy cartridge (making it not a dummy cartridge at all).</p></li>
<li><p>Someone fired the pseudo dummy cartridge, and either didn&#39;t hear the &quot;bang&quot; which is at least as loud as a toy cap gun, or they ignored it.</p></li>
<li><p>The primer somehow had enough force to push a relatively heavy .44 caliber bullet past the tight chamber throat and forcing cone and into the tight barrel enough that the cylinder didn&#39;t get jammed in place, allowing someone else to come along and load blank cartridges into it. I wish someone would make a video to demonstrate this. I have a .45 caliber revolver and reloading equipment to make a pseudo dummy round, but I don&#39;t want the job of clearing the jam afterwards. I can post this from someone who&#39;s witnessed it though:</p></li>
</ol>

<blockquote>
<p>Once with a reloaded .38 the person reloading apparently forgot to add powder. The primer detonated and the bullet wedged halfway between the cylinder and barrel. Required a cleaning rod down the barrel to force the bullet back far enough to open the cylinder.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="http://thefiringline.com/forums/showpost.php?p=2930025&amp;amp;postcount=4">http://thefiringline.com/forums/showpost.php?p=2930025&amp;amp;postcount=4</a></p>

<p>Note that a .38 bullet is lighter than a .44 bullet, so if a .38 gets stuck between the cylinder chamber and the forcing cone from the force of a primer, how is a .44 bullet going to make it all the way into the barrel from just a primer? The .44 bullet is not only heavier, but its greater circumference means more surface contact area between the bullet and the throat / forcing cone / barrel bore, which means more friction, which makes it even harder to push.</p>

<p>I&#39;ll go ahead and add a fourth:</p>

<p>Someone loaded blanks into a revolver <em>that was going to be fired while pointed at someone</em>, without first checking the barrel for obstructions.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you can tell by my username, I’m a wee bit of a Crow/B. Lee fan. Hell, my pop socket for my phone is a picture of Lee as Draven. Back when this happened I was obviously upset. Back in the early 90’s the internet was nowhere near what it is today. So my source of info was magazines back then. There was a full magazine dedicated to this incident (People or one like it). In it they went into Bruce Lee’s death and how it ‘appeared’ that Brandon’s death was related to his dads. I don’t remember the actual specifics, but I believe the yakazua(spelling?) was involved with both. GREAT article OP!! Many thanks. </p>

<p>That&#39;s what my mom seams to think too and her sources would have come from Chinese newspapers and radio. Though, I thought the claims that Japanese/Yakuza poisoned Bruce Lee because his movies portrayed Japan in a bad light was propaganda, I guess we&#39;ll never know the truth. Hell, it could have been a rival martial arts school that didn&#39;t like his philosophy and saw him a a threat. Other theories I&#39;ve seen are the so-called, &quot;Lee Family Curse&quot; and that the Triads were behind the deaths because they saw the popularity of him and his Cantonese movies as a danger to their &quot;investments&quot; in the Mandarin entertainment industry.</p>

<p>Love The Crow, both the movie and the comic. It&#39;s so unfair, Bruce Lee inspired so many and Brandon would have gone on to do the same. My memory is fuzzy but I think he was considered a rising star round the time of his death.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I always thought the most rational explanation was that someone or some people making money off of him thought him dying like his father would make a ton of money for them and make him another cash cow for decades, like his father (Bruce Lee). So basically, sociopath film producers or managers offing him without a care like a product, to push sales and drama and to make a ton of money for decades (Bruce Lee 2). Everyone wanted to be the new Bruce Lee after he died, and Brandon Lee was probably less than human to many of the rich film people or investors and more like a rare toy.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>And it is a great write-up, thanks. Others can now theorize as to why he was killed.</p>

<p>Personally I like to pay attention to dates; 3/30/1993 amounts to 33/22.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The wider public didn’t even realise, perhaps until they subsequently saw the film, that Lee had been shot dead at the exact moment in the story when his character is; or what bizarre, three-way art-life parallels there are with O’Barr’s tragic backstory, the impending wedding of Eric and Shelly (Sofia Shinas) written into The Crow, and the fact that Lee was due to marry his own fiancée, Eliza, in Mexico on April 17th that year.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If I were to guess I&#39;d say it was some sick occult ritual/sacrifice, as with many celebrities. Perhaps also to get to his father, who was quite the truth teller.</p>
