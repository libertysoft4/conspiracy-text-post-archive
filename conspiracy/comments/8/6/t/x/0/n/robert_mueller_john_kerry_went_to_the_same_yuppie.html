<p>BCCI investigation as reported by the failing New York Times in 1991.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Now the fight among investigators is coming out into the open. Manhattan District Attorney Robert Morgenthau, who gave impetus to long-contained probes, told a Senate subcommittee headed by Senator John Kerry that he is getting no cooperation from the Thornburgh Justice Department.</p>

<p>Justice&#39;s Criminal Division chief, Robert Mueller, tells me he will have a hatchet-burying session with the independent-minded D.A. next week, and vehemently denies having told British intelligence to stop cooperating with the Manhattan grand jury.</p>

</ul>

<p>Now it’s time for the fun stuff!</p>

<blockquote>
<p>BCCI was the Bank of Credit and Commerce International, a dirty offshore bank that then-president Ronald Reagan&#39;s Central Intelligence Agency used to run guns to Hussein, finance Osama bin Laden, move money in the illegal Iran-Contra operation and carry out other &quot;agency&quot; black ops. The Bushes also benefited privately; one of the bank&#39;s largest Saudi investors helped bail out George W. Bush&#39;s troubled oil investments.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Idiots Are Taking Over&quot;</p>

<p>it&#39;s not the right time to be sober
now the idiots have taken over
spreading like a social cancer, is there an answer?</p>

<p>Mensa membership conceding
tell me why and how are all the stupid people breeding
Watson, it&#39;s really elementary
the industrial revolution
has flipped the bitch on evolution
the benevolent and wise are being thwarted, ostracized, what a bummer
the world keeps getting dumber
insensitivity is standard and faith is being fancied over reason</p>

<p>darwin&#39;s rollin over in his coffin
the fittest are surviving much less often
now everything seems to be reversing, and it&#39;s worsening
someone flopped a steamer in the gene pool
now angry mob mentality&#39;s no longer the exception, it&#39;s the rule
and im startin to feel a lot like charlton heston
stranded on a primate planet
apes and orangutans that ran it to the ground
with generals and the armies that obeyed them
followers following fables
philosophies that enable them to rule without regard</p>

<p>there&#39;s no point for democracy when ignorance is celebrated
political scientists get the same one vote as some Arkansas inbred
majority rule, don&#39;t work in mental institutions
sometimes the smallest softest voice carries the grand biggest solutions</p>

<p>what are we left with?
a nation of god-fearing pregnant nationalists
who feel it&#39;s their duty to populate the homeland
pass on traditions
how to get ahead religions
And prosperity via simpleton culture</p>

<p>the idiots are takin over [x8]</p>
