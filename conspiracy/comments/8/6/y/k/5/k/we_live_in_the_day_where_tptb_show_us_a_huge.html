<p>Never mind that Congress Trump was used to elect. And Congress controls the nation&#39;s purse strings, not the President. He only has to sign and remember what Norquist said about President&#39;s during the 2012 campaign.  </p>

<p>We don&#39;t need a President with his own agenda, we only need someone to sign the documents. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You haven’t been paying attention if you think this is the first time something like this has happened. We literally had the Speaker of the House of Representatives go on national tv and say that the Senate would have to pass a bill before anyone could see what was in it, including some of the people that were supposed to vote it into law. This wasn’t in 2018, this was in 2010, and it was said by a Democratic rep who was talking about a democratic majority house. Don’t play the two side game because it’s absolute bullshit. </p>

<p>We’ve been living in a world where the elected officials think they’re better than the people they represent and they slap us in the face with it every single day, and it isn’t just the Republicans and “Fox News”, it’s also the Democrats and the “liberal bias media”. I’m not even going to touch your remarks about a “stolen election” whatever the hell you meant by that.</p>
