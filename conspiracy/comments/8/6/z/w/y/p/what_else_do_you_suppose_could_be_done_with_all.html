        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>We now firmly know they’ve created &amp; sold personality profiles of every user on their platform.</p>

<p>These profiles are built by the Likes we shared on webpages, friend posts, and content posted to the platform. The keywords we use. Our photos are mapped with a machine learning recognition of our likeness.  They know the intimate messages we’ve shared with each other. Where we’ve traveled to and our daily movements.</p>

<p>What else can they do with that besides sell ads?</p>

<p>Here’s ones thought...</p>

<p>They own the most sophisticated collection of individualized behaviors and affinities built on user data since 2004.  </p>

<p>They could program these Personality Profiles into an unbeatable AI Product that could:</p>

<p>-populate a city of bots as big as their Profile count to interact in the background of a MMORPG</p>

<p>-create AI enriched VR Avatars through which future generations can interact with their ancestors </p>

<p>-run near true-to-life simulation models for various population studies politically, civically, or academically motivated </p>

<p>Curious what other thoughts r/conspiracy can spin up on this.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Kratom is a perfect example. Something that probably was not originally on the radar of government/corporations... until it starts popping up all over the internet as a way to get off opioids and other natural health benefits that threatens Big Pharma. The evidence they used to justify it&#39;s ban was the fact that it showed up in the autopsies of a small number of people. These people quite obviously died from other drugs... but they jumped on the fact that Kratom was in their systems and spread the misinformation. I can guarantee that prior to when the agenda of banning Kratom came onto their radar, no one was ever testing for it when someone died of a drug OD. It was a setup from the start IMHO.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>yeah for sure but it&#39;s not just FB. The media seems to be trying to make it all about FB and CA instead of digging deeper into the shit that is clearly still going on. And when all our social medias are only showing you one side of a story ur reality becomes distorted, this coupled with human nature to surround yourself with others that have similar views your entire world becomes an echo chamber. </p>

<p>Sure many people question what is presented to them and look for other sources but many millions just accept what is presented to them because it confirms to their own views. These are the people that are targeted for manipulation. </p>

<p>I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if their actual money machine was access to our data in real time.</p>

<p>All anyone seems to be interested in with this story is who CA can be tied to politically instead of talking about the other companies around the world that are obv still doing this and manipulating huge numbers of people with impunity. </p>

<p>We will get a shell company disbanded and maybe a few billion wiped off FB stocks and people will cheer and think a victory has been won while the people really behind all this shit just carry on doing the same thing with another shell company. </p>

<p>From my experience,  the kinds of people who reflexively use those apps have low value profiles filled with selfies, memes and reshared posts of clickbait news.   The result of mining those profiles is like collected wisdom of every village’s idiots. </p>

<p>Maybe some level of AI/big data analysis can create better sheeple propaganda.  But even if that’s what happened with Trump in 2016, it’s not like it gave him a super majority or even a simple majority of the popular vote. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>By studying the behaviour of mass shooters or killers, they could perhaps set up a thought crime type system like that Minority Report flick. Considering someone like Cruz (sp) was allowed to murder all those students might be so they can gather as much info as possible to fight them in the future before the rampage happens. Of course this becomes a slippery slope as the masses would be overjoyed to pre arrest a violent psycopath or sexual predator, but might not be as ready to accept pre arresting someone who fits the profile of a whistleblower, petty thief or political dissident.  Depends how far you want to go with profiles and the accuracy of predictions tested. I mean it couldn&#39;t be that hard to track down violent offenders, pedophiles and extremists now but is there any indication tptb do anything to stop their heinous crimes? It would be easiest still to arrest white collar criminals but for some bizzare reason no one is ever held to account - except for the odd lamb to slaughter like Madoff. I&#39;d say it&#39;s likely they allow it to happen, and the masses to suffer, so as to study us further. The worse our situation and the more unsafe we feel, the time will be right for them to act. Just spitballing.</p>
