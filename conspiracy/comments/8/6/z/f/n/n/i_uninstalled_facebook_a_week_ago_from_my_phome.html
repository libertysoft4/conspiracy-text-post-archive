<p>Watching a video now, another Facebook ad. I&#39;ve seen the ad so many times now (50ish ballpark estimate) that it&#39;s catchy jingle is memorized perfectly. Screenshot taken a minute ago (ad played but is now on bottom of video);  <a href="https://imgur.com/a/T59qy">https://imgur.com/a/T59qy</a></p>

<p>What I wanted to ask all of you; anybody have any memories or recent examples of something like this, involving strange &#39;coincidences&#39;, happening to you?</p>

<p>I also have targeted advertising disabled for google. So... I don&#39;t get it. Didn&#39;t see a Facebook ad ever before on Google until this. I also have been getting a lot of Rules of Survival ads recently ever since I downloaded PUBG for mobile. Again, don&#39;t get it since I disabled targeted advertising. Shits fucked.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>almost all the ads Ive gotten over the last year reflect this... leave home depot, instagram advertising home depot. park near a resturant, promted by maps to add review for resturant etc.  most recdntly was talking about finding new work, and started getting bombarded with &#39;looking for work in so and so province?&#39; Ads on youtube, insta which is all I really use anymore. (Canada) Its getting very blatent and desperate. every phone is like a tether to most of these peoples minds, especially the majority with little to no attention span. Our attention and our money is what they want, milk as much of it before we die, unfortunatly many are walking dead, or deeeeeply sleeping</p>

I’ve been TALKING to friends (not googling, not web searching, not on any apps) to my friends about one time I went on a greyhound bus in college. Five minutes later, browsing Instagram and theres a Greyhound bus ad. It was the creepiest thing I’d ever seen and definitely not a coincidence.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have one FAR more obscure.</p>

<p>I used to work for an IT company. My buddy was working on a project where he was using BRIX computer systems. Prior to that day I had never heard of them. I had been talking to him about the specifications etc. Then when I got back to my desk and pulled up Facebook, there was a big ad for BRIX computers on my iPhone. The odds of that occurring organically have to be absolutely astronomical.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I’ve been systematically removing apps and accounts for this exact reason. I’ve seen things I haven’t searched or typed in ads immediately after a verbal conversation as well. So far I’ve removed all Facebook stuff and am in the process of downloading all my pics to delete my account. Next, I’m disassociating google from my life and all associated apps and accounts. Then I’m moving from there. Not sure exactly how but I found an old flip phone that I’m very tempted to add as my dedicated phone again so I don’t have an info-scraper in my pocket at all times.</p>

Strangely Insta seems to have no idea where I go or what I&#39;d be interested in. I&#39;m constantly getting ads for Coach bags and pageant dresses even though I&#39;ve never been to a store that sells them and who I follow would indicate that&#39;s not my taste. </p>

Ever since I did that for Facebook and IG their ads literally don’t know what to target anymore. </p>

<p>Also, I’ve started to think since they don’t know what to target <em>in the moment</em> that somehow it’s almost as if the ads have decided to start pulling back to what I used to look at over the last few years which is fucking creepy </p>

<p>On my SOs Xbox he has adverts for games or customs controllers on the front page, I get films - stereotypically for women films - or things like HayU (I think that&#39;s the reality app thing) rather than anything that would hint I play the games. It almost feels cultured.</p>

<p>Nothing you’re saying is vaguely related to what I said. </p>

<p>Yes, they cost them money. Because you make them more money. But clicking on them is insanely dumb. It is like putting out a fire with your face. </p>

<p>No, they’re not mining bitcoins, just legally tracking you offsite. Any single click and you’re in their hands for another 1/3 year. </p>

<p>And they can do significantly more. Because Facebook only tracks what cookies you have. Clicking an ad allows them to track you offsite. </p>

<p>You obviously have zero understanding about the topic at hand. Nice try though. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This isn&#39;t about the mic. They texted it. They probably clicked through and granted all the permissions to some app allowing it to read the MSM messages.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t buy the mic part because it doesn&#39;t make much sense from a technical position.</p>

<p>First and foremost, what you do online is far more revealing. If you use Google, <a href="https://myactivity.google.com/myactivity">go to your history.</a> It knows every page you go to, every search term used, if you use location data, then it knows every store you&#39;ve visited.</p>

<p>There is no reason for them to listen to your microphone, because all of this other data is far more telling as it is what you <em>actually</em> do rather than what you might casually mention at some point.</p>

<p>Second, technically speaking, they are either sending all the data back to be processed, which would take up a ton of data, or they are constantly processing everything that is coming in through the mic, and sending back just keywords, which would be a huge drain on your battery. Either of these would be easily noticed and simply testable. Why hasn&#39;t anyone definitively shown this yet? The most likely answer is that it isn&#39;t happening.</p>

<p>How do you know they never searched for it? Because they said so? Maybe they don&#39;t realize that they searched for it or maybe they are lying. How do you know that they didn&#39;t piece the information together some other way? How many things did these people talk about in front of their phones that they didn&#39;t get advertisement about?</p>

<p>But, more importantly, why hasn&#39;t anyone been able to show any reasonable evidence that they are doing this? As I said, processing all of the data coming from the mic would cost a lot of power, and sending all of the data back to avoid processing it locally would use a ton of bandwidth. These would both be easily detectable, so why hasn&#39;t anyone offered up something that actually detects them using a lot of either one of these during times of lots of talking?</p>

However, I haven&#39;t Googled or otherwise searched for Mets tickets.

<p>Strange coincidence.</p>

<p>Late last night: I started seeing advertisements for &#39;The Terror&#39;, a show appearing on AMC this Monday. Once again, I haven&#39;t searched for it in any way. However, I was just watching a DVR&#39;d AMC show which had loads of commercials for &#39;The Terror&#39;.</p>
