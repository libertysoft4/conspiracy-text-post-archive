So far, 7 south Florida schools have purchased policies. It reminds me of Wal-Mart&#39;s dead peasant policy from a number of years ago. Little smelly. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s a good question I wonder how they sidestep that or if they have to.</p>

<p>In the article:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, the site of the February shooting, is covered under a general liability policy through its local school district, which does not spell out whether shootings are covered, a spokeswoman said.</p>

<p>That was also true at Sandy Hook Elementary School, where a gunman killed 26 people in 2012. A wrongful death lawsuit filed by families of two children killed there seeking unspecified sums <strong>has dragged on since 2015.</strong></p>

<p><strong>In the case of public schools, state laws that exempt them from liability or limit the payouts can leave survivors and their families with huge medical expenses.</strong> Those laws can have exceptions and in some states, such as Florida, the legislature has authority to waive such limits.</p>

<p>Still, the process can take years and while school employees are generally covered through workers’ compensation insurance <strong>some shooter policies could help families meet some of the medical costs.</strong> </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Smelly or slimey? This is exactly what insurance companies do, they take advantage of risk and make money off of it. </p>

<p>I live in an area where there is a lot of hills and mountains. Tornadoes aren&#39;t something people here worry about. However, we did have two tornadoes touch down once like 15 years ago. It barely did $1000 in damage. When that happened, you better believe there were commercials from insurance companies in the area selling tornado insurance, knowing full well the likelihood of another tornado happening in this area is fairly slim, and if it did, the damages would be relatively cheap. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>it does, a lot of companies and schools are actually under-insured.  When something like a shooting happens, there are going to be lawsuits and this helps cover the settlements.
