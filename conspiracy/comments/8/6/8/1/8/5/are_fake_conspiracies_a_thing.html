I don&#39;t want to get into that, but what strikes me is how they brought in very serious scientists and gear. This had me thinking. Some very scary conspiracies have so much supporting evidence that it is more of a leap to dismiss them. </p>

<p>A good example of this is MK ultra. We have the government documents. </p>

<p>But then you have other things associated with the term &quot;conspiracy theory&quot; that are nuts and have very poor evidence. Flat earth comes to mind.</p>

<p>It is possible that some conspiracies are fake to discredit more credible ones?</p>

<p>Take your MK Ultra example.  Where do you draw the line? As soon as you go &quot;off grid&quot; so to speak, there&#39;s really no justification aside from common sense/personal preference to suspend belief in some cases and not in others.</p>

<p>Sure, the CIA was naive, bored, or self-indulgent enough to go into the weeds of parapsychology. What we have evidence of are successes in the &quot;soft&quot; hypnotism of suggestibility. Nothing surprising. Nothing ground-breaking from a scientific perspective.</p>

<p>Absolutely. Not even &quot;is it possible&quot;. It happens.

He says that he was presented with false information about alien contact and wound up disseminating it because he believed it to be genuine.  The &quot;conspiracy theorist&quot; buzzword just doesn&#39;t have the same sting to it when people who self-identify as conspiracy theorists come off as sober-minded critics who spout concrete facts about the abuses of government, industry, energy companies, the MIC, CIA, state department, and more.</p>
