        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>r/shoplifting was one of those subs that I just found really interesting to read through. It was like, you know it&#39;s technically wrong what they were doing but you still kind of rooted for them for being the underdogs fighting the big bad corps. Ya stealing is wrong but seeing posts of people walking out with hundreds and thousands of dollars from stores that exploit child slave workers just seemed like bittersweet revenge. </p>

<p>I&#39;m bummed to see it has gotten banned by Reddit&#39;s most recent purge. They&#39;ve been getting hit a lot with shills lately so it was clear that sub was attracting attention but still surprised to see it banned when I went to visit it earlier.. hopefully Voat will carry on the torch.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Shoplifting is not a victimless crime. You are thinking of it on a higher level, and I get what you are saying. But think about it on a store level. The employee now has a theft on their watch, this will likely negatively affect them.

    <div class="md"><p>A walk through the product store and 15 aisles to see</p>

<p>All the pretty, pretty packages staring back at me</p>

<p>Which is my favorite, where is my chance</p>

<p>To remove the product and stick it in my pants</p>

<p>And I want to see what&#39;s on sale now, what&#39;s for free
Every time I go to shop I steal from enemies who steal from me and from you</p>

<p>(If you only knew then you would steal too)</p>

<p>Adrenaline rushes, the products in my grip</p>

<p>I am only shopping but now it&#39;s time to lift</p>

<p>I look for my moment, and down my pants I stick</p>

<p>The product I&#39;ve selected is concealed against my dick</p>

<p>Paranoid as fuck security in tow</p>

<p>Is he really trailing me and does he really know?</p>

<p>Of my little secret, my pride and his shame</p>

<p>This is so exciting kid, it&#39;s like a fucking game</p>

<p>I&#39;m almost to the counter, will I make it to the door?</p>

<p>Will I get away like a million times before</p>

<p>Or be caught, jailed, banned from the store?</p>

<p>Like if the product I&#39;ve selected slips and crashes to the floor</p>

<p>I get to the door and out the door I slide</p>

<p>I feel a sense of dignity, I feel a sense of pride</p>
