The car was traveling at 40mph, allowing the car to stop at less than 120ft. The woman was crossing a two lane road with a width of 12 meters walking around a meter per second.</p>

<p>Uber LIDAR would have seen her and more than 8 seconds to already start breaking, but it didn&#39;t. I don&#39;t believe any of the reports that Uber self driving tech was operating correctly, which is why they stopped all public road tests of their vehicles. This sad death of the poor woman should be a criminal investigation against Uber self driving car technology.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Agree fully! Something doesn&#39;t seem right. I&#39;ve watched several tests of self driving cars and everyone stopped way before the object would get hit. Even in darkness. This lady, after watching the dash cam, was clearly in front of the car.  Though it seemed she almost cleared the car before it hit her. Definitely feel there is more to it then what they tell us. that&#39;s normal for our lives on this Earth though, so don&#39;t really expect anything less or more. </p>

<p>Uber did lose a lawsuit recently for stealing some of google’s code when they hired over an engineer, so maybe they had their lidar logic was in shambles without that code. Strange either way...</p>

<p>Things need to change now, not when all of that is already in place. Technology is pushed forward by people testing new technologies and applying them to current situations. I don&#39;t think it has been suggested that this would be the &quot;end all be all&quot;. This is the beginning, not the final product. tech companies will never adopt new technology if they have to entirely wait until all infrastructure is compatible. It just doesnt work that way, and if it has to, we might as well give up on it now because that will never happen. </p>

<p>I agree that there needs to be a larger system to all of this (car to car communication as well as car to sensor communication), but like I said, there will be no investment until some productivity is proven first. Which is precisely what they are trying to do. </p>

<p>If it is known that car2car and car2markers are needed why not wait until governments start rolling this out? </p>

<p>If it a kid was mowed down I think the government would be held negligible as well if they know that a driverless future needs a fully developed system first of smart streets and cars communicating with each other first before being in the public.</p>

<p>thats a pretty laughable statement. The answer though, is because they want it to actually become a reality, not a politically bogged down fucked up, completely unreliable standard. </p>

<p>As for the testing locations, I agree that there needs to be more caution taken, but shit man mistakes happen. How many hours of testing do you think they have done already? And 1 mistake that impacted the public. Its a trade off situation. Maybe they need to find specific routes and make sure people are made aware that they are opting in to being part of the testing by using those routes, or something like that, but this stuff cannot be tested in a testing facility. That was step 1. They are well beyond that, and you will never make something that functions in the real world, without testing it in the real world. </p>

<p>At least this stuff can be scrutinized and people can be held accountable for it. Unlike all the &quot;testing&quot; the government does on its own population without anyone even realizing. Shit testing out a new political strategy could have more devastating effects on the public than 1 person getting killed accidentally. Its a tragic mistake, and there needs to be more resources invested into making sure it never happens again, and Uber should make that family whole (as much as possible). </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Getting caught up in one death misses the long term benefit of getting humans from behind the wheel. An investigation should be conducted and blame assigned, but don&#39;t lose sight of the end goal. Humans are terrible drivers and kill a lot of people in the process. Seeking to reduce that long term is a very worthwhile goal.</p>

<p>I have watched these suv’s drive around Phoenix for the past two months without any failure. Do we know if the car attempted to stop?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The biggest fear is that Uber/Lyfts lobbyist are paying off these transportation officials to push unsafe tech without really looking into what is safe the greatergood of public safety. </p>

<p>I&#39;ve already tweeted to CAL Transportation Authority that they need to start smart devices as well, and hold public safet above these real world test. I feel more people to reach out their officials and ask the same.</p>
