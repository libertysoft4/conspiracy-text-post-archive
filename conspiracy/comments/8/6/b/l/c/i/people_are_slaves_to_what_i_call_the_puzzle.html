        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Ill be talking about some controversial topics in this post.  I dont care what side of the argument you are on.  This post isnt about arguing what side is being fooled less.  This is about knowing you are being fooled regardless of how much or how little.</p>

<p>I call this &#39;The Puzzle&#39; because each piece fits with the others and you can only see the big picture when you connect the pieces.  Im sure there are more and would love for you guys to add to this, but Ill start:</p>

<p>So lets start with vaccines/drugs.  Some people believe theyre 100% safe and that if they werent doctors wouldn&#39;t push them.  Someone can explain that theyre not fool proof and people will still call them crazy because a doctor pushes them.  Yes, doctors are educated but the assumption that a doctor must know more about a drug simply because they paid more and spent more time at school is ridiculous.  The vast majority of doctors pushing vaccines/drugs have no knowledge of the science behind their creation.  They just know &quot;if patient exhibits x then prescribe y.&quot;  That statement alone will cause massive criticism btw.  People cant/wont/dont-want to accept the idea that doctors aren&#39;t all knowing.  They are raised their entire lives to trust Doctors and learning that maybe theyre not so genius after all does not compute.  &quot;theres no way an average person (who dedicated time to study one specific drug) could possibly know more than a doctor!”</p>

<p>This natural urge to reject reality to stay comfy &quot;knowing&quot; that a doctor knows what&#39;s best for us is exploited by pharmaceutical companies and makes the situation worse and worse.  Theyre using our laziness against us (more on laziness later).</p>

<p>Next up is Food, more specifically GMO food.  We are told GMOs are safe (just like drugs) and because they&#39;re cheap we accept it.  We dont want to accept that GMO food is making us sick (and needing drugs) and tired (literally) because we dont want to pay more for the real stuff - we already pay too much for health insurance and drugs as it is!  We dont want to have to cook a meal for our families.  We want to stop by the drive through or pop in a frozen pizza when we get home from work..we just spent 12 hours working (to pay for those drugs and internet and tv) so we dont have time or energy (probably should eat better) to cook real food.</p>

<p>again, our laziness is exploited and compounded even further keeping us trapped.</p>

<p>Speaking of working too much.  How many of us work long hours for bad pay just to make someone else rich?  That isnt a conspiracy on its own, but when you consider the fact that we are working longer and being paid less just to keep the rich rich while making sure we have just enough for our meds and a DiGiorno tonight things come together just a little bit more.</p>

<p>We wouldnt need all the extra cash if we didn&#39;t have to pay so much for so little.  Less work means more time.  And more time means more sleep, more energy, and better health (physically and mentally).  </p>

<p>Those three attributes can then be used to make better meals (more time) that will ultimately cost less in the long run (less work), that will make us healthier (less drugs/more money), and have more time to do things we love (better mental health).</p>

<p>Now, real quick I want to mention the media.  The media takes these three things and pushes them onto us relentlessly.  Drugs/Vaccines are safe, GMOs are safe, Hard work will lead to success (AKA more money so you wont need to struggle to pay for meds/food).</p>

<p>I believe these are the 4 main pieces of this puzzle, and I hope I did a good enough job outlining how they come together to keep us down.  Each of them work off each other throwing us into a downward spiral.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Certainly a cool premise bro. I have a question for you related to this: First...in real life, I go outside and see the citizens of my city walking around and driving and such. The majority of people I see exude contented personalities, or at least a decent attitude. If I stop and listen to their conversation, they are talking about their families and usually are in good spirits. If I were to strike up a conversation and mention a conspiracy theory or two, most would laugh and suggest to me I lighten up. How do you think this generalized &quot;good attitude&quot; is maintained...while at the same time corporate media force feeds an incredibly narrow perspective? Indeed, I do overhear people who can be very angry and bitter about their circumstances, but this is actually an exception; most people I see are neutral or happy. We log into /r con and see the world through this lens of pessimism...but what is it about humanity that drives many of us to shrug off the tyranny, and face the world with hope?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think for a lot of us it&#39;s the only way to survive. Most people simply don&#39;t have the energy to invest in researching everything going on in the world, I certainly don&#39;t. There&#39;s also an element of powerlessness that comes with realizing the world is not what we&#39;ve been taught and that&#39;s demoralizing and uncomfortable for most. </p>

<p>To the point about conspiracy theories,  I find people are more open to them then you&#39;d think. Just the other day I was joking about chemtrails with some friends and to my surprise they weren&#39;t as dismissive as I thought they&#39;d be. None if us believe it&#39;s for mind control or that every contrail is a chemtrail but the consensus was that the government has absolutely attempted weather modification in the past and likely continues to test it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re conditioned since birth to &#39;put on a mask&#39; when you go out into the world. Just look at your social media: is anyone posting about how sad and depressed they are? No, they cherry pick moments from their lives to give the appearance that they&#39;re doing great. It&#39;s a hyper-extension of this &#39;mask&#39; we all feel obligated to wear.</p>

<p>You can hear it in our linguistic interactions. &#39;How&#39;s it going?&#39;, &#39;good! you?&#39;. Or, if someone is upset, we say, &#39;Hey, it&#39;s okay, don&#39;t be sad.&#39;
Don&#39;t be sad. It&#39;s a command. Pleasure/jouissance/enjoyment is mandated by our culture. Haven&#39;t all the conditions for satisfaction been met? You want food, there&#39;s a million options. You&#39;re horny, there&#39;s a billion different pornos to watch. Bored? Thousands of shows, movies, books, records. Are you still not happy, despite all of this? Well, we have a pill for that...</p>

<p>Every smiling face you see in an advertisement, every aspirational show you watch, every self-help book, every motivational meme that flashes across your feed....it&#39;s all subliminally giving you the message that you SHOULD be okay. It&#39;s a cardinal sin in our consumerist culture to NOT be okay. People act accordingly.</p>

<p>Just go have a deeper conversation with any of these people. They&#39;re not actually happy. They&#39;re just good at playing along.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I get what your post is about and understand where you are coming from. Especially on GMO&#39;s. I have a huge garden and have 4 chickens to offset most of the stuff I get from the grocery store. I&#39;m just not 100% sold on the vaccine stuff. </p>

<p>My problem with the work/success part is really on whoever it is. You are correct that hard work doesn&#39;t always equal success, especially when you work for someone else. I mean, I didn&#39;t graduate college, worked my ass off for 7 years building a business and will probably make someone&#39;s yearly salary this month(I still work about 55 hrs/wk). I am not saying that to brag, I say it because in this country, you <em>can</em> do whatever you want to do. It is just up to you to do them, I lived in virtual poverty for 3 years doing it but made it. I hear all the time about how this country has gone downhill and the American dream is gone. I find that utter horseshit. The dream that the past generations had is gone and it is never coming back. Their American dream of working at a factory for 35 years, without an education, retiring with a pension, not making any waves, going to church and being <em>content</em>. That sounds awful to me.</p>

<p>My main point is that you don&#39;t have to do any of these things if you don&#39;t want to. It is just up to you and your beliefs, dreams and dedication to accomplish them. Don&#39;t want to vaccinate, don&#39;t, just home school your kids. Don&#39;t want to eat GMO&#39;s, grow your own food/slaughter your own meat. Don&#39;t want to work your ass off for shit pay and shit pension, don&#39;t, work for yourself.   </p>

<p>But isn&#39;t that the point though? Why do only the people like you, who desire to be something great and work really hard for it, deserve a decent living? Why doesn&#39;t the nurse who does what she loves and performs an absolutely necessary function in today&#39;s society, but don&#39;t desire greatness but rather a good social life with friends and family, deserve a decent wage and a good pension? Very few in today&#39;s America works in factories, and most factories require a good deal of know-how since advanced machines are involved these days. </p>

<p>If someone works in Tesla&#39;s factory, why should they have to rely on standby ambulances because their boss whom is filthy rich and rather gets more filthy rich and go to mars rather then give them solid and healthy working conditions? Not much of his wealth would be sacrificed by doing it but he still, even through the negative press(which is minuscule compared to the glorification he gets), still keeps the working conditions shitty. And he&#39;s a &quot;good&quot; example of capitalism as far as I&#39;m concerned. </p>

<p>But the point is you don&#39;t have to go full communism if only people had decent wages. People like you who devote their life to work would still be way ahead of those who settle for a factory or nurse position in society. You&#39;ll still need them to be around, if they weren&#39;t nothing you earned would be worth your effort, because no one would create what you desire. That&#39;s where we&#39;re going with this, with people making less and less wage-wise, and the uber rich gets wealthier, eventually the system will collapse because the contradictions of capitalism which Marx described are <em>real</em>, again, you don&#39;t have to go full communism, but you have to address the issues, and the wages people receive for their time is an enormous one. And deliberate. </p>

<p>They just know &quot;if patient exhibits x then prescribe y.&quot; That statement alone will cause massive criticism btw. People cant/wont/dont-want to accept the idea that doctors aren&#39;t all knowing.

</blockquote>

<p>Spot on. People really don&#39;t understand how hard big pharma has kneecapped the medical industry. Doctor&#39;s don&#39;t run their own clinical trials, they rely on &#39;scientific studies&#39; given to them by &#39;objective&#39; organizations, which are actually funded by the same pharm companies that are trying to sell the drug. &#39;If patient exhibits symptom x than prescribe y&#39; is exactly what a lot of medical interactions have been reduced to. &#39;Treat symptoms&#39; is the edict of our era.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Awesome post, this is the type of thing I show to people who tell me I&#39;m crazy for thinking our world as a whole is just one big illusion. Another point on the powerful abusing our innate laziness, is that few people want to do anything about it in America. There are plenty of people who do care, but as a country that has been artificially divided by the media, it just seems too hard. We all hate each other and argue about these problems that have been hand fed to us by the media, and it creates the illusion that we could never, ever unite as a nation against the tyranny.
&quot;And it&#39;s just soo much work.. I mean gosh, if you want to start a revolution you have to quit your job.. but then you can&#39;t pay bills! Then you&#39;ll lose your car... Eh.. yeah I don&#39;t feel like it.&quot; This is the average response I get when I say we NEED change, 1984 isn&#39;t &quot;coming in a few years&quot;, it&#39;s already here. You are so right that they abuse our laziness, they make it impossible to live outside of the system, literally ILLEGAL. We can try and try to overcome this, we have to, but the level of control is so calculated, so sinister, that it&#39;s easy to lose hope. </p>

<p>The media takes these three things and pushes them onto us relentlessly. Drugs/Vaccines are safe, GMOs are safe, Hard work will lead to success (AKA more money so you wont need to struggle to pay for meds/food).</p>

<p>Didn&#39;t the media start most of the counter movements on these? I thought that vaccines and drugs were being countered by nonsense expensive snake oils, and sensationalist personalities trying to snag some views.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t disagree with the &quot;Hard work leads to success&quot; but can you really have a strong society with people sick all the time? These rich people want you healthy so you don&#39;t have to cost them productivity, which is literally why the work schedule started, because people&#39;s work days were staggered because they could just do stuff whenever, until factories.</p>

<p>Same with GMO&#39;s. Reduced production costs, bigger yields, cheaper product. For the same price as regular tomatoes because they pretty much only adjust bacteria sensitivity? Heck yes they&#39;ll take it.</p>

I can get on board with this “puzzle”, and don’t flatter yourself because no it’s not something you have to put together to see the big picture because new flash mother fucker it’s been obvious for years to anyone here, but to say that doctors don’t know more than never about drugs? How the actual fuck do you get that? Well I’m sure if my docotor doesn’t then my pharmacist does at least. Like come on...you really think they’re just educated to treat symptoms with generic drug A? If you really believe that you know just as much about what you’re being medicated with as a doctor then you’re just kidding yourself.
