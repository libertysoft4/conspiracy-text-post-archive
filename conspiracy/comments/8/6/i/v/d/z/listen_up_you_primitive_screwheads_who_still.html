<p>Of course he lied. Look, that&#39;s how these biased investigations work. They can&#39;t find any evidence for the reason they&#39;re conducting the thing to begin with, so they find something else they can get the sucker on. Blowjob from an intern! Got &#39;em! Now all we gotta&#39; do is catch him in a lie about it. Which they did. Bam! Impeachment. And everyone forgets they were supposed to be investigating Whitewater.</p>

<p>Believe me, the Dems are doing to Trump the same thing the Repubs did to Clinton back in the day. They&#39;re all equally worthless.</p>

<p>It&#39;s so transparent, I don&#39;t know how anyone can&#39;t see it. And yes, the Mueller investigation will fold. Either that, or Trump will just fire him.  It&#39;s not a dream. One of those two scenarios WILL happen. Trump might be impeached (I doubt it), but he certainly won&#39;t be removed.  </p>

<p>Then he&#39;ll get re-elected. Mark this comment for future reference.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I base that on ten years in cybersecurity work, and a basic understanding of operational security. A weaponized hacking operation is going to have multiply redundant layers of network traffic control. There is ZERO chance that a global superpower&#39;s cyberwarfare division would allow their OPSEC to be up to one guy remembering to activate a VPN connection.</p>

<p>For the second part... Do you know what IP spoofing is, exactly? Or what &quot;a proxy in Moscow&quot; would be? IP spoofing doesn&#39;t help with 2-way communications. It&#39;s useful for something like a DDoS attack where you&#39;re flooding traffic in one direction. But if you want to connect to a service like a social media network, it has to be able to ACTUALLY communicate back to you. 
Yes, a proxy would be a possibility. This is usually done in one of several ways - a paid dedicated server (which leaves a paper trail), a paid service (same problem), or a covertly enlisted machine that operates out of a residential or commercial IP space without the owner&#39;s knowledge so as to appear to be really originating from that party (which is usually done with malware).</p>

<p>If you were talking about the Nigerian military making this mistake, yes, I would buy that. But I guarantee you, the Russian military cyberwarfare division is smarter than that. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Exactly. Until authorities can examine the DNC server, there will be no conclusive proof as to who Guccifer 2.0 is, or who leaked the DNC e-mails. Two separate incidents, as you probably already know.</p>

<p>Of course, that is until Wikileaks drops the bomb on everyone and forces the DNC to hand over the servers. Which will happen eventually I believe.</p>

<p>If they did, then Comey kept it a secret. No official statement from the FBI has ever been made about looking at image servers, and indeed, according to Comey&#39;s testimony before the Senate Intelligence Committee, physical access to the servers would provide &quot;the best evidence.&quot; Further to that Comey explained that the FBI requested such access &quot;a number of times&quot; on &quot;different levels&quot; but were denied by the DNC. </p>

<p>The ultra-conservative political site Gateway Pundit interpreted the documents to mean that, “DEMOCRATS FUNNELED TARP FUNDS BACK TO THEIR PACS! That’s tax-payer bailout money that went right to the pockets of Democrat PACs!”</p>

<p>1.Clinton knew ISIS received support from US allies Saudi Arabia and Qatar</p>

<p>2.Most Clinton Foundation donors are not American
In 2013, speaking to Mediacorp, Clinton admitted that the largest share of donations made to the Clinton Foundation came from abroad.</p>

<p>3.New DNC chair was the ‘mole’ leaking Bernie Sanders doc
In January, Donna Brazile – former campaign adviser to Bill Clinton in the 1990s and a high-ranking official in the Democratic National Committee – passed along to the Clinton campaign an email from the Bernie Sanders campaign revealing his strategy to reach African-American community through social media, called the ‘Twitterstorm Tuesday.’</p>

<p>“Thank you for the heads up on this Donna,” responded Adrienne Elrod, a Clinton campaign aide.</p>

<p>Brazile replaced Clinton confidante Debbie Wasserman-Schultz, who was forced to resign as DNC chair after the party files were leaked just prior to the convention in July. She tried to justify the action, saying there were “plenty of emails from me to both team Clinton and Sanders.” She has also accused those who reported on the emails of working overtime for Trump and “his Russian hackers.”</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Policy-making and ‘backroom deals’ should be concealed from voters
Among the first batch of emails were partial transcripts of speeches Clinton gave after leaving the State Department. In one such speech in 2013, Clinton said policy-making process should be concealed from voters as backroom deals it includes could make people &quot;nervous.&quot;</p></li>
<li><p>&#39;Can&#39;t possibly&#39; vet all refugees
At a luncheon for the Jewish United Fund of Metropolitan Chicago Vanguard in October 2013, Clinton said that the influx of Syrian refugees into neighboring Jordan – fueled by the ongoing civil war – makes checking identities of all asylum seekers impossible.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>&quot;And particularly with Syria which has everyone quite worried, Jordan because it&#39;s on their border and they have hundreds of thousands of refugees and they can&#39;t possibly vet all those refugees so they don&#39;t know if, you know, jihadists are coming in along with legitimate refugees,&quot; Clinton said, according to speech transcripts found in Podesta&#39;s emails.</p>

<ol>
<li>Chelsea Clinton ‘acted like a spoiled brat’ 
A December 2011 email from Doug Band, a lawyer who helped create the Clinton Global Initiative (CGI), said that that Chelsea Clinton was hardly caring about “her role” in the office problems.</li>
</ol>

<p>“But I&#39;m sure Chelsea is more concerned with a mostly false story in the distinguished [NY] post about [MF Global] and Teneo not her role in what happened to Laura/Bruce, what she is doing to the organization or the several of stories that have appeared in the NY Post about her father and a multitude of women over the years,” Band wrote.</p>

<p>In a separate email to Podesta a month earlier, he said Chelsea was “acting like a spoiled brat kid who has nothing else to do but create issues to justify what she&#39;s doing because she, as she has said, hasn&#39;t found her way and has a lack of focus in her life.”</p>

<ol>
<li>  ‘Cultivating’ certain media
In an attempt to confirm Clinton’s attendance at an event on April 12, 2015, the day she announced her presidential bid, Podesta emailed Palmieri about the news website Business Insider. They both described the outlet as right wing.</li>
</ol>

<p>“Am I right that they&#39;re right wing? They get a fair amount of traffic,” Podesta asked.</p>

<p>“They are right wing, but Philippe [Reines, Clinton&#39;s former State Department aide] weirdly has cultivated them,” Palmieri replied.</p>

<ol>
<li>HOPING FOR TRUMP</li>
</ol>

<p>Hillary Clinton allies were apparently hoping the Republican primary electorate would nominate Donald Trump as the GOP candidate for president.</p>

<p>Media commentator Brent Budowsky wrote to Podesta on March 13 that “Right now I am petrified that Hillary is almost totally dependent on Republicans nominating Trump.”</p>

<p>“…..even a clown like Ted Cruz would be an even money bet to beat and this scares the hell of out me…..” Budowsky wrote.</p>

<p>A Democrat National Committee strategy document from April 7, 2015 also wrote about “elevating the Pied Piper candidates,” identified as Trump, Cruz and Carson.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Hillary’s Staff Admits That She Hates Everyday Americans: During the Democratic debates, Hillary Clinton rather famously said that she considered “Republicans” to be her enemies. Similarly, Clinton said, “You know, to just be grossly generalistic, you could put half of Trump&#39;s supporters into what I call the basket of deplorables. Right?” Although it is surprising that someone running for President would be so open about despising everyone who disagrees with her politically, that at least makes a certain kind of sense. A socialistic Democrat detests people who believe in capitalism and conservatism.</p></li>
<li><p>Hillary Was Paid Off By The King Of Morocco: Hillary Clinton was credibly accused of taking a bribe during her cattle futures scandal and there have been numerous allegations that money was paid to Bill Clinton for speeches or to the Clinton Foundation and in return, Hillary repaid the money with support for a government from the State Department. This scandal reinforces the idea Hillary Clinton is corrupt and can be paid off.</p></li>

<p>Podesta is a political genius.</p>

<p>But also Seth Rich was the leaker and Podesta and Co had him murdered so they could continue to pretend guccifer was a Romanian/Russian.</p>

<p>Oh and Podesta and Co also spoke to Roger Stone about the data they had &quot;hacked&quot; and they also sent some of the &quot;hacked&quot; data to a Florida GOP member so he could win the seat the DNC didn&#39;t want to win to keep up the illusion that Guccifer was a Romanian pretending to be a Russia just in care Hillary lost.</p>

<p>You&#39;re funny. Trying to be anyway.</p>

<p>The Guccifer 2.0 persona came out just before the DNC e-mails were about to be released (which the DNC already knew was going to happen, as they knew the material was in the wild), and claimed responsibility. But Guccifer 2.0 only had material from the DCCC, and nothing about the e-mails. Two separate incidents.</p>

<p>This persona was used as way to pre-empt and misdirect anyone looking into who the real leaker was. The Russia Collusion narrative came about after the election. The incidents are also separate, and only connected after the fact. </p>

<p>You haven&#39;t read any of the background material on this, or delved too deeply into this, have you? </p>

<p>Yes, that&#39;s &quot;one&quot; of the reasons why I suspect Crowdstrike.</p>

<p>If you read carefully what I said, I stated the Guccifer 2.0 persona came out <strong>before the DNC e-mails were released</strong>*, not before Crowdstrike fingered the GRU.</p>

<p>Crowdstrike (and the DNC) knew these e-mails were out there, and so scrambled to do damage control. Blaming the Russians was part of that operation.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I base that on ten years in cybersecurity work, and a basic understanding of operational security. A weaponized hacking operation is going to have multiply redundant layers of network traffic control. There is ZERO chance that a global superpower&#39;s cyberwarfare division would allow their OPSEC to be up to one guy remembering to activate a VPN connection.</p>

<p>For the second part... Do you know what IP spoofing is, exactly? Or what &quot;a proxy in Moscow&quot; would be? IP spoofing doesn&#39;t help with 2-way communications. It&#39;s useful for something like a DDoS attack where you&#39;re flooding traffic in one direction. But if you want to connect to a service like a social media network, it has to be able to ACTUALLY communicate back to you. 
Yes, a proxy would be a possibility. This is usually done in one of several ways - a paid dedicated server (which leaves a paper trail), a paid service (same problem), or a covertly enlisted machine that operates out of a residential or commercial IP space without the owner&#39;s knowledge so as to appear to be really originating from that party (which is usually done with malware).</p>

<p>If you were talking about the Nigerian military making this mistake, yes, I would buy that. But I guarantee you, the Russian military cyberwarfare division is smarter than that. </p>
