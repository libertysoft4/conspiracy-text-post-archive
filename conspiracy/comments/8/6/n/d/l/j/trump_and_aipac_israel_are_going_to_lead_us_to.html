<p>Yeah.  I know.  The piece of shit, asshole war mongers could then/probably will just launch some heinous 911-like false flag and blame it on Iran/Russia.</p>

<p>Again, however, I&#39;m really hoping the public will be at this point at least somewhat wise enough to know the horrible m.o. of these psychopathic demons and really dig into any supposed <em>&quot;Iran/Russia/middle east terrorist attack on the innocent U.S. - OHMYGOD!!&quot;</em> that might happen to the U.S. and they/we won&#39;t fall for the PTB utter bullshit.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I’m not sure this was ever really a functioning Democracy, to be completely honest.  It’s just that the internet is now making information much more widely accessible and available to pretty much everyone - so now anyone can really know and educate themselves with regard to what the truth of history really is and just how utterly evil and full of shit TPTB are and have literally always, always been.</p>

<p>The system isn&#39;t “currently failing”.  We’re just now waking up to the fact that things have <em>always</em> been failing.  More and more people are just waking up to the fact that it’s pretty much <em>always</em> been a failure in many, many ways, for many, many people and groups in this society.</p>

<p>And the more that folks find out about this, the more people who previously might have thought themselves unaffected by any of it begin to wake up to the way that this malady does indeed reach out and affect them directly as well.</p>

<p>The divide between top and bottom is being exposed too.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Absolutely.  Correct and agreed.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The laziest people have it all while the hard workers live mediocrely.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Well, I wouldn’t exactly go <em>that</em> far, as there are a lot of rich hard workers and lazy 99%ers.  The key isn’t so much in the hard work that one does one way or the other as much as it is about the positive or negative intent that one imbues in what they do regardless of whether they work hard at it or not.</p>

<p>I’d rather have someone who generally doesn’t work too much, but when they do work, it’s for the good of everyone, than someone who’s a super hard worker, but it’s only to benefit themselves at the expense of everyone else around - and what they do is regularly enough to the <em>detriment</em> of everyone around.</p>

<p>That’s horrible - and it seems pretty much like the m.o. of TPTB to a significant enough extent.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>They want to shut down Facebook and Cambridge bc it gives power to others and not the top.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Among other things they try to shut down, yes.  This much seems definitely correct.  I don’t disagree with you.</p>

<p>The more power and attention we keep giving the MSM, the more strength they will have to keep lying to us and clouding our minds with debilitating propaganda.  The more we all step away from the MSM and pay it no attention, the less we will be able to be manipulated.</p>

<p>Exactly this.  This is the very reason, as you said, why TPTB have been rushing and fighting so hard to shut down and control the internet.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The information war is a critical component for TPTB&#39;s grip on the reality they want the people to experience.</p>

<p>Yep.  Correct.  And they’re having a pretty hard time keeping a lid on their lies because of the internet.</p>

<p>We’re definitely saying the same thing sir.  Yes.</p>
