<p>So because you dont immediately know anyone, your whole premise is that now suddenly nobody does. And because nobody personally told you through word of mouth, that means its all made up. But you can&#39;t actually prove that becuase you haven&#39;t actually traced every connection you have to the 6 degrees you keep talking about. </p>

<p>I admire your skepticism. Are there any major media events where you believe they have made up the victims?</p>

<p>Over at <a href="http://fakeologist.com/blog/2018/04/26/toronto-van-sidewalk-hoax-media-are-narcissistic-naval-gazers/">Fakeologist</a> they have been discussing these recent major media events in Canada. The general consensus seems to be that nobody died, nobody goy hurt.</p>

<p>When I was new to &#39;conspiracy&#39; theories, this seemed too far out for me to entertain.</p>

<p>These days I see things differently...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I mean, there is a long history of false flag attacks I have no doubt about if that counts?  Tonkin, perhaps the USS Maine, the USS Liberty and Lavon affair are some that come to mind involving the U.S. And of course while there are many other alleged ones that I don&#39;t believe specifically without more evidence, but I have am certain there must be additional ones that have occurred historically and which there just isn&#39;t much public evidence.</p>

<p>But if you&#39;re talking about modern mass shootings then no, there aren&#39;t any I find to have reasonable evidence of being fake at the moment. The general case aside, this OPs reasoning is incredibly weak.</p>

<p>An anonymous internet user saying everyone should believe the Canadian Government made a false flag van attack framing an incel because: the person would 100% know about it from his friends? Even though he doesn&#39;t even make up a number or location of his friends? And, based on his answer to me, he appears to be conceding he didn&#39;t even ask people about it but that it&#39;s safe to assume every person he knows would have volunteered the information to him assuming they had any?  </p>

<p>That reasoning could be applied to almost any story in the world. I might as well claim some random country in Africa doesn&#39;t exist because I don&#39;t know anyone from it.</p>
