        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>The TV is the worst invention that humankind has ever created, it has radically transformed a society of simple small communities into large disoriented communities of brainwashed zombies.</p>

<ul>
<li>When there is an important event, the TV will just deceive you and send you into a dead alley.</li>
<li>The rest of the time it will just distract you with useless pop garbage and sports.</li>
</ul>

<p>It deceives people down to the smallest level, where even cartoons for children have a nefarious agenda embedded in them.</p>

<p>It&#39;s a fine tuned brainwashing machine, that is what it is, it has been carefully engineered to provide the highest levels of persuasion:</p>

<ul>
<li>video frequency, the combination of colors, the sound tone, utilization of subliminal messages, the composition of different fictional characters in shows...</li>
</ul>

<p>All of it was carefully, scientifically engineered to provide the most efficient brainwashing level possible.</p>

<p>I doubt the media was ever truthful, but a newspaper is totally harmless compared to the TV. Nobody should expect the paper news to tell the absolute truth, but newspapers were usually covering local events, so it was usually just highlighing smaller events with the least amount of spin on them.</p>

<p>For this reason I am still subscribed to a local newspaper. I did detect deception in them a couple of times, but it&#39;s still a more pleasant form of information take, since you have time to think while you read it.</p>

<p>However the TV is just a total brainwashing apparatus. It makes people be glued to the screens, and there are constantly shows on them, it feels like people who watch them are in some sort of stasis state, where you can&#39;t talk to them while they absorb the information from the TV. It&#39;s very scary if you think about it.</p>

<p>I haven&#39;t watched TV for more than a decade now, and never looking back, but whenever I go to a friends house, the fucking TV is always on, and I can barely talk with them 2 words before something happens on the TV and totally distracts me, and I lose my line of thought.</p>

<p>It&#39;s just fucking horrible, people can&#39;t have now a 10 minute chat in private without the TV running in the background.</p>

<p>One of the most disgusting things that I have observed is when they put TV&#39;s in the rooms of terminal patients in hospitals. So dying persons instead of spending their last days with their family and friends, they should just watch the TV instead. Absolutely horrible.</p>

<p>People have no clue how mentally enslaved they are by this demonic machine, and I am not even religious, but this is as close to demonic as it gets.</p>

<p>It&#39;s the biggest conspiracy of the 20th century.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Interestingly I don&#39;t think the Internet is worse than the TV. Even social media is less harmful because it only shows pictures and text but less sound.</p>

<p>The TV is a much more sophisticated brainwashing apparatus.</p>

<p>But it taps into the hivemind, the average person&#39;s innate desire to fit in with the crowd.</p>

<p>Ever wonder why so few intelligent men speak their honest opinion in facebook discussions? They know the consequences.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well it&#39;s certainly an echochamber a lot of the times, but still places like Reddit where people are more pseudonymous, people speak more freely.</p>

<p>So it&#39;s not really the social media that is the issue but the privacy.</p>

<p>But then again, text and pictures is still less suggestive than video with sound.</p>

<p>So the TV is either way the best brainwashing tool so far. Get ready for VR helmets and neural interfaced VR like in the Matrix movie, then it will become truly Orwellian.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>But social media is clever. TV has a message that is sent out to millions. One single message. Maybe the ads vary regionally. But the message does not quite fit anyone person and the ads are not personally targeted. </p>

<p>Social media is more insidious. Machine algorithms follow your clicks and tailor what you see and do not see based on your response. Its interactive, it feeds you want you want to see, it targets adds specifically to you and it uses a database of people that you know to do it. </p>

<p>The power of these platforms is insane. They can tell if you are dating someone or about to date someone based on your rate of messages and words in it. They know you relationship is in a rough patch if the rate of messaging drops. They can cross reference databases, track behaviors, and then adapt your information space.</p>

<p>...Oh and by the way, the found that things that make you happy don&#39;t keep you clicking. Often the content that you keep clicking is stuff that makes you feel a bit bad. Not too bad, you stop clicking then and go find a bottle of alcohol. Just a little bad. A little insecure. </p>

<p>You keep clicking, you by things to keep up with friends, you book vacations to show you do exciting things too, you post selfies of food you eat to show you are gourmand as well, etc... Far more insidious than TV.</p>

<p>And one easy way to see why that is true... young people watch less tv, less likely to own cable etc. They are turning off their TVs, but they are married to their phones and social media. </p>

<p>People don&#39;t watch TV on their carribean vacation but they are sure to facebook. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Indeed but people still have a choice, that is the point I am trying to make.</p>

<p>Many people now use adblockers and cookie blockers, so tailoring propaganda individually based on collected data becomes harder.</p>

<p>Now if you are logged in, tough luck, we know what FB does anyway.</p>

<p>It&#39;s still people&#39;s choice to use that.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Agreed, although it can depend on what you watch it none the less causes damage to those that happen to watch fake mainstream news.</p>

<p>They brainwash people into making it socially accepted to call light skinned humans &quot;white&quot; and dark skinned humans &quot;black&quot; </p>

    <div class="md"><p>alright yeah, i suppose i didnt fully explain what i meant but yes i whole heartedly agree. i suppose i was trying to get at the point that after i had stopped watching television, it became grotesquely obvious how manipulative and blatantly offense the prospect of the television programming becomes. </p>

<p>sorry i didnt explain all the way the first time, just felt like i had to type it out real quick. i dont feel that the television gets enough credit for being such a sneaky mind control device as it should unfortunately. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Don&#39;t allow yourself to fall into a false sense of security since you don&#39;t watch TV. Sure, the internet is not as bad and there is a lot of useful information, but social media and the internet is the new television, and the mind-manipulators know that are constantly improving their methods for studying and programming us. They know our psychology better than we do most of the time. It&#39;s important to be conscious of that and not be lulled to sleep.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;d say Youtube is more close to a TV than anything else, because it&#39;s audio-visual, and look at the home page of youtube, it&#39;s mostly either the MSM tv channels feeding political bullshit, or pop bullshit like these singing shows.</p>

<p>Still it&#39;s still less influencing. You have the power to watch what you want.</p>

<p>With the TV it&#39;s almost like a physchological force keeping you from pressing that turn off button on the remote control.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My mother watches TV all the time (every waking moment!!).  When I visit her I can&#39;t stand the sound or the ugly bastards and bitches that inhabit this ungodly realm.  Steve Harvey and Doctor Phil (filth) and Judge J(ew)dy and the worst Morey Povich.  Morey Povich looks like an exhumed petrified mummy and I actually shudder when I actually see him on TV!  He has the smile (grimace) of a dead rigor mortised corpse</p>

<p>She is absolutely hypnotized  by this BS but with my own life I can only do so much to help her.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well it&#39;s certainly an echochamber a lot of the times, but still places like Reddit where people are more pseudonymous, people speak more freely.</p>

<p>So it&#39;s not really the social media that is the issue but the privacy.</p>

<p>But then again, text and pictures is still less suggestive than video with sound.</p>

<p>So the TV is either way the best brainwashing tool so far. Get ready for VR helmets and neural interfaced VR like in the Matrix movie, then it will become truly Orwellian.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t understand smart TV&#39;s even outside of the surveillance issue. Every other device I  and most people own, gaming consoles, blu-ray/DVD players, firestick, they all do everything the smart TV does, why the hell would I spend the extra money to have it built in to my tv? Maybe it is of a more insidious nature </p>
