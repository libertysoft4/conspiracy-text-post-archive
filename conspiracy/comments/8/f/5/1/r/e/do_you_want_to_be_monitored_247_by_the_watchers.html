<p>I&#39;m not going to let this issue pass unnoticed! As an equal denizen of this planet I say HELL NO!</p>

<p>I honestly think the &quot;unprecedented&quot; processing power of these satellites will be combined with Window&#39;s trove of metadata</p>

<p>I think it will have onboard infrared and night vision. It will be networked with first responders world wide. It will monitor us like we were in a zoo.</p>

<p>Don&#39;t be resigned to apathy share this, upvote it, make it be seen and known by everyone! Demand that your government, workplace, neighborhood, school/college reject it!</p>

<p>This is privatized spying by supra-national corporations and billy doesn&#39;t speak for the world even if he likes to think he does!</p>

<p>Rise up and reclaim your voice! Reclaim your power!</p>

<p>In the comming days I will submit to you all a petition to reject EarthNow, I pray that we can all fight this zoo earth mentality together.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It sounds as if you want to live in a world with no wireless communication, no cellphones, no wifi connected devices. Are you one of those RF sensitive people? What do you do that commands so much privacy and why don&#39;t you think these technologies are so incredibly useful that it&#39;s worth the risk? That&#39;s what I tend to think, the benefit far outweighs the risk.</p>

<p>I think technology is the one and only thing that will ensure the human race can live forever. Technological progress should be the human races #1 goal. Jmo.</p>

<p>There&#39;s just certain things you have to take into account- don&#39;t sell drugs on your freaking cellphone. Don&#39;t talk about that dude you murdered. Don&#39;t take pictures of your illegal activities. Pretty simple, easy to follow ruleset for people who actually have a reason to distrust digital devices. No one is interested in spying on regular people- they might want your credit card information, but they could probably care less what you sound like when you&#39;re making sweat love to your significant other or what you look like naked. </p>

<p>With regard to financial fraud, the banks are incredibly good at catching it, and either reversing or erasing the charges. There&#39;s really very little for the average joe to fear from IoT. It&#39;s the big companies doing big research with intellectual property that have something to fear from IoT, and I couldn&#39;t care any less about them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There&#39;s going to be cameras that are the size of a grain of salt, powered by the very light they take in, and paired with wireless transmitters equally as small.

    <div class="md"><p>No the wifi is unfortunately always on, thanks to the ISP&#39;s policy, they have installed a wireless router that is always on, so there is always wireless connection in the house and there is no way to turn that off without turning off the entire internet. Which is a serious problem because if any IoT wifi-capable device is in the house it can just send out data covertly through that router.</p>

<p>Mobile phones don&#39;t shut down anymore after you turn them off, the snowden docs revealed that they are always on until they run out of power.</p>

<p>New smartphones don&#39;t even have removable batteries, so it could be always listening.</p>

<p>So you have a permenent internet cloud around the house, and surveillance devices that don&#39;t power off and can connect to the internet wirelessly.</p>

<p>WHAT COULD GO WRONG?</p>
