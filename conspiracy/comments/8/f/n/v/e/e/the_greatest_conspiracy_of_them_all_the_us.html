        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I always hear that &quot;White people don&#39;t have a culture&quot;.</p>

<p>But the truth is there is no such thing as a &quot;White person&quot; or a &quot;Caucasian&quot;. There&#39;s Italian American&#39;s, there&#39;s German American&#39;s, there&#39;s Polish American&#39;s, and so forth. We have some of the strongest cultures known to man. We&#39;re the Alexander&#39;s, the Washington&#39;s, the Caesar&#39;s, the Van Gogh&#39;s, the Napoleon&#39;s and the Aristotle&#39;s.</p>

<p>Convincing all White people that they belong to the same group was one of the greatest tricks ever pulled in the US. AND NO ONE QUESTIONS IT. </p>

<p>In a span of 3-4 generations, White people have lost everything that makes us be us through assimilation. We lost our languages. We&#39;re losing our religions. We&#39;re lost our communities, we&#39;ve lost our families and now we&#39;re on track to be the first generation to do worse than our elders. It&#39;s no wonder people so hopeless and confused in life. Our current lifestyles challenge everything we&#39;ve been bred to be for thousands of years.</p>

<p>And the worst part is, everyone is too focused on their fucking Netflix and porn to even notice that everything they inherited is going to hell in record time.</p>

<p>It&#39;s sad, but I believe in us. I believe we can do better and I believe people will wake up. We&#39;re facing the greatest challenge of our lives.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So I asked my dad’s parents where my family was from and their history was. I got an ‘I dont know jewish-german or something’. I asked my mom’s mom cause my grandfather was never in the picture and she said her father was Irish and her mother an orphan that could be native american as she was found at an orphanage along the trail of tears but idk. </p>

<p>I can say this all I know of St Patricks day is ‘lul dont wear green you get pinched. And as for Jewish-German idk what the fuck that is cause everyone in my entire family has always been Christians. </p>

<p>So my culture has always been generic white blend of culture + southern culture which honestly more people need in their lives. The south is supposedly the racist capital of the United States and while there are racist people everyone is much nicer. Generic white culture is generic holidays of christmas, thanksgiving, christmas(lol every part of this was stolen from different white cultures) , halloween, and valentines day. Whats hilarious is most people dont understand where parts of these holidays cams from. They dont understand that ‘Christmas Trees’ are a germanic tradition of decorating trees during the winter festive season and have no ties to christmas. They dont understand the gift giving other than LUL jesus’s birthday. None of these people understand that everything has been stripped away from them for centuries upon centuries.</p>

<p>People keep claiming cultural appropriation!, but how is it when every white culture has been stripped away and generalized into a marketing campaign. Have you guys seen Cocco? See all the Day of the Dead celebrations? Halloween had ties into that culture and history but what is it now? Go buy costumes and hand out candies you buy. See the difference? One is a celebration of your history and spending time with deceased ancestors the other is a fucking marketing ploy to get you to spend money. </p>

<p>The only place I&#39;ve ever seen this actually happen is Tumblr or the occasional college campus. </p>

<p>Do what you enjoy. Read some books, or just look up some Youtube videos on native Americans, the Irish and the German Jews. Take what appeals to you and leave the rest behind. </p>

<p>If some people disapprove, let &#39;em, that&#39;s their right, but it&#39;s also <em>your</em> right to live whatever way makes you happy as long as you aren&#39;t hurting someone else (and I mean actual hurt either physical or emotional, not tumblr &#39;oh I&#39;m so offended&#39; hurt). This goes both ways though. If they want to put up Christmas trees without understanding the history behind them, it&#39;s no skin off your nose.</p>

<p>A huge part of happiness is accepting yourself whether other people accept you or not. </p>

Black on white crime is something the media sweeps under the rug. Can you image what this would be if it were the other way around. If you cant, let me remind you. Remember the Tawana Brawley Scandal of a few years back when they thought a bunch of white guys attacked the black girl and raped her? the media had that on TV 24 hours a day 7 days a week for months until it was found out it was fake then it was all swept back under the rock again and never mentioned again because they don&#39;t want any of that kind of Truth to come out. But when five f****** animals do this to two white people who were minding their own business they don&#39;t want to shine a light on it they want to hide it. If white people would have done this to black people there would have been a March every year in honor of those two people and politicians would get involved, celebrities would get involved, but since it&#39;s just white people being attacked by black people they want to hide it and you know that&#39;s true. Over the last few years we&#39;ve had dozens of fake white supremacist hate crimes going on that turns out to be staged. Once the media finds out its staged they mention it no more. 
Relevant? YES!</p>

<p>Ironic, you&#39;re the only one practicing pedantry.  My focus is on precision of argument.  You just want to stand on your head and plug your ears to anything you don&#39;t want to hear. </p>

<p>And you&#39;re asking for a specific answer;  I&#39;ve given you one.  Germans in America are a population of whites who have had their culture and language taken from them.  Now you want to move the goalposts.</p>

<p>Because, you see:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>using it to support his claim that “white people” today are currently being deprived of their “culture” due to...?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That&#39;s not his claim.  His claim, as you have now been shown repeatedly is:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In a span of 3-4 generations, White people have lost everything that makes us be us through assimilation. We lost our languages. We&#39;re losing our religions. We&#39;re lost our communities</p>

<p>You have been shown all of this. </p>

<p>All you&#39;re doing here is making excuses.   You asked to be shown an example of how white people have been denied their culture.  You have been shown a very stark and relevant example.  Rather than admit the error of your ways, you&#39;ve been reduced to making excuses for it.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>I&#39;m going to show you how wrong you are, again, and then hopefully that will shut you up.  I doubt it though.   It&#39;s clearly your hatred for whites that motivates you to continually ignore reality. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>German Americans (German: Deutschamerikaner) are Americans who have full or partial German ancestry. <strong>With an estimated size of approximately 44 million in 2016, German Americans are the largest of the ancestry groups reported by the US Census Bureau</strong> in its American Community Survey.[1] The group <strong>accounts for about one third of the total ethnic German population in the world.</strong></p>

<p>1/3 of the ethnic German population of the entire world had their language banned <strong>twice</strong>, were lynched publicly and targeted for internment twice, but you want to pretend like it&#39;s not a relevant example.</p>

<p>You know that it&#39;s relevant.  Just be real here:  You&#39;re okay with it.</p>

The reason white culture has dissipated is because it&#39;s been a while since we migrated, so we&#39;re all kind of slowly creating a new culture together since we are not in Europe anymore. Blending Italian, German, English values and traditions together. Culture happens through family, not through big brother or anything. It&#39;s not the government&#39;s fault that your nana never taught you how to make kugal. Culture is passed down and when we migrated we just sort of have been blending everything TOGETHER, with minorities, to create a unique &quot;melting pot&quot; of culture that America stands for. Did you forget you&#39;re in the greatest country with the most various races together? We&#39;re american. That&#39;s our culture, nothing to do with race. You give people like me a bad name, man.

<p>There&#39;s no true reasoning for your thinking other than hating race. It&#39;s literally a color.

<p>Look up your genealogy and get into your own culture. There&#39;s no suggestions saying that we don&#39;t have a culture, like I said, it&#39;s just changing. And you may say it&#39;s made up but I&#39;m pretty sure that America definitely has lots of races, with lots of cultures, some white Muslims, some black Jews, we got em&#39; all. 100% a melting pot. I don&#39;t believe care if the term was made up, it&#39;s TRUE. That&#39;s why we were founded. To create a place for ALL. </p>

<p>And if you don&#39;t care for that, then you can either leave the country or quit complaining. Cause it&#39;s not a jew-spiracy. It&#39;s fact. We&#39;re all Americans having BBQs together with baked beans and hot dogs. Totally a culture, just too new to be accepted or documented as such. We&#39;re just now settling in. You really should allow yourself to be more open-minded. Tbh I feel bad that you can&#39;t.

<p>It&#39;s really not.</p>

<p>Search through my replies.</p>

<p>We have different IQ&#39;s. We smell different. We talk different. We have different everything and those differences help create who we are. On almost every way you could compare us, we are different. Different means not the same.</p>

<p>Whites are a pretty damn good race. One of the smartest. One of the richest. One of the most peaceful. Easily one of the most sympathetic and empathetic, even when it&#39;s to our own demise. We are the most diverse race appearance wise - We have 4 of the 4 hair colors and 6 of the 6 eye colors. Whites are responsible for almost every major advancement of the last 1,000 years or so.  We&#39;ve shown we are able to make it on our own and we&#39;ve shown we can create amazing societies.</p>

<p>The US created the civil rights act in the 1900&#39;s to stop communism, which was selling itself to various African countries and successfully used black people as a way to create struggle in the US. The US government heavily funded slavery through expeditions to get slaves and through ships to guard them from being stolen.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Cause it&#39;s not a jew-spiracy.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Jews own 4 of the 5 major media companies in the US. 2 of the 3 major music companies. 6 of the 6 major movie companies. They also control google, facebook and reddit! 2% of the population controls all of that. If people like me had that much control, you don&#39;t think we wouldn&#39;t push our own narratives and causes? Really?</p>

<p>Go down this list of jewish power in the US - <a href="https://imgur.com/a/AJsXqx9">https://imgur.com/a/AJsXqx9</a>. Even if half of this was determined to be bullshit, that&#39;s a whole lot of fucking power.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>We&#39;re all Americans having BBQs together with baked beans and hot dogs.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>MUSLIMS DO NOT EAT PORK. Those better be beef hotdogs. And IIRC, they won&#39;t eat meat unless it&#39;s been blessed by priests anyway and had a ritual done.</p>

<p>When&#39;s the last time you did a blessing over your double quarter pounder?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Totally a culture, just too new to be accepted or documented as such. We&#39;re just now settling in.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Humans are tribal. Humans like people who are like them. No scientist disputes this. In fact, Science thinks people are most happiest with their FOURTH COUSINS. I made a whole album with various studies, just for you: <a href="https://imgur.com/a/7Tm8LwX">https://imgur.com/a/7Tm8LwX</a></p>

<p>A country of different cultures is a country of different creeds. Look at what went down in Yugoslavia. Look at what&#39;s happening in the Middle East. South Africa. Rhodesia. Zimbabwe. Look at how various groups in the US feel just on free speech, which is a cornerstone of our country - <a href="https://imgur.com/a/VMYvHfI">https://imgur.com/a/VMYvHfI</a>. This is not what people of the same mind look like.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You really should allow yourself to be more open-minded. Tbh I feel bad that you can&#39;t. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;ve lived in other countries and been treated for better and worse just because I had a different skin color. I talk to people from different countries every day. They know the differences, they freaking point them out. No one is going to confuse me for a citizen from the Congo or someone from the Middle East.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I&#39;ll just tell my mixed child to ignore people like you, that she&#39;s just as human as you are. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Why the fuck would I bother with a mixed person? I have no attraction to blacks. I feel absolutely nothing. I don&#39;t want black kids. That&#39;s the last thing I want. I can&#39;t stand homosexuals, but I&#39;d rather have a gay kid than a mixed kid, because at least I know the gay kid isn&#39;t going to extend his degeneracies to another generation.</p>

<p>I like who I am. I&#39;m proud of what I am. I want to know that in 10,000 years I have a descendant who is just like me out there spreading my wishes, my genes and my desires.</p>

<p>I choose mates to move up in the game, not move down. Someone who is smarter than me. Who is taller than me and has a better physique. Who is richer than me. Who&#39;s hair is blonde and eyes are blue. There&#39;s two types of people who get the furthest in life on an even playing field money/connection wise - the best looking people and the people with the highest IQ. When I have kids and marry, it&#39;s not just what I want, it&#39;s what my family wants? And you know why? Because marriage is a partnership and a partnership where one side benefits more than the other is a bad deal.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ive had this discussion a few times on here, its interesting to ponder. </p>

<p>But honestly, just on a conversational level, what do you think when you watch high level basketball or NFL...better yet, watch international track and field and even with the different nations represented at the elite levels, wether it be the US, Barbados, Jamaica, South Africa, England, whomever it may be...there is always a particular trait they all share...do you think that purely comes down to social factors only? Social factors that stretch across numerous nations? </p>

<p>You can even straight up say Icelanders are 10cm taller on average than say for instance, Japanese people. Which is fitting considering they have the same Worlds Strongman titles as the US despite having 300k people to 200m+</p>

<p>So im curious, what, in theory, would constitute a genetic difference to you?</p>

<p>That&#39;s not true, and it could be seen within a pack of full breeds and one that is not full breed. A husky/corgi mix, within a pack of full bred huskies will be significantly disadvantaged. That&#39;s a fact. </p>

Mutations were selected with a constantly rising level of intention, and man could propagate these changes very easily.  This allowed us to create breeds from the much less dissimilar, natural **landraces,** which would be much closer to the equivalent of human ethnicities.</p>

<p>Unlike breeds, ethnicities are the product of no one&#39;s design.  There was little to no task-oriented, artificial evolutionary pressure in their origin, and as primates are very n-strategy- each capable of having less than a tenth the offspring of a typical dog, after taking around 7 times as long to reach reproductive maturity with a gestation period 1/4 as long- their rate of adaptation would have been insignificant compared to that of dogs.</p>

<p><em>I&#39;m not saying it&#39;s skin color alone</em>. Do you even read my comments before you comment back? Furthermore, there are numerous differences in human races beyond what you&#39;d call &quot;environmental factors&quot;.</p>

<p>What if they had 1 grandparent that was black but they look entirely white, are they partly black? That doesn&#39;t make sense of course if they look white! What about Asian? We in America tend to paint japanese/Koreans/Chinese all with the same brush but what about those in the middle east? They&#39;re Asian but they tend to be darker, do we not consider them black too? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>You&#39;re explaining how races are like different breeds of humans. lol. What you said, could be applied to how people breed dogs. Take genes and characteristics from one breed and mixing with another breeds genes and characteristics, to create a combination of the two (ie. their offspring). Mix a husky with a corgi, and see what happens. ;) </p>

<p>It&#39;s an appeal to authority when you claim that something is true because experts in the field believe it. It&#39;s not an appeal to authority when you claim that something is true because of reasons 1, 2 and 3. </p>

<p>The guy is just asking for EVIDENCE, preferably from someone who is knowledgeable on the subject and not some rando on a blog. This is a completely reasonable request. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hello. I study Microbiology/Immunology, so while my field of work may be a couple of magnitudes smaller in terms of scale than that of the topic at hand, I think I can contribute. </p>

<p>The major population divides that brought about the different human races were very recent on an evolutionary scale, so while there isn&#39;t THAT much of a difference between everyone, it&#39;s still very easily detectable. </p>

<p>You mentioned earlier that skin color has no bearing on an individual besides their appearance. This is untrue. The skin is a major organ that has many roles beyond just being a barrier to the outside world. One of it&#39;s jobs is allowing for the synthesis of Vitamin D3, which requires UVB from the Sun in one of it&#39;s reactions. Black individuals are dark because of their increased levels of Melanin. Melanin has the ability to absorb solar radiation, impeding UVB and stopping the synthesis of Vitamin D. White individuals however have less Melanin, meaning more UVB is left unabsorbed, and more Vitamin D can be made. As such, white individuals have much lower rates of vitamin D deficiency than black individuals. </p>

<p>On the other hand though, since Melanin protects the individual from solar radiation, it can help prevent mutations from accumulating in skin cells. As such, black individuals have much lower rates of skin-related cancers than white individuals. </p>

<p>The reason as to why there is a difference in skin color leads back to the difference in environment the two populations lived in. Being further north, whites were exposed to significantly less sunlight on average, meaning the protection given by a high level of melanin was actual a detriment. Natural selection did the rest. </p>

<p>Asian Glow is caused by a defect in one of the enzymes tasked with breaking down alcohol and occurs in an absolutely ridiculous 36% of East Asians (that&#39;s nuts). </p>

<p>Japanese people have pretty low genetic variance and because of the founder effect, have some really cool/interesting differences in allele frequencies compared to the rest of East Asia. </p>

<p>There&#39;s many more differences between the major groups of humans. Are they overall significant? On a day to day basis, not really. However, they do exist. Race is not a social construct. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ive had this discussion a few times on here, its interesting to ponder.
But honestly, just on a conversational level, what do you think when you watch high level basketball or NFL...better yet, watch international track and field and even with the different nations represented at the elite levels, wether it be the US, Barbados, Jamaica, South Africa, England, whomever it may be...there is always a particular trait they all share...do you think that purely comes down to social factors only? Social factors that stretch across numerous nations?</p>

<p>You can even straight up say Icelanders are 10cm taller on average than say for instance, Japanese people. Which is fitting considering they have the same Worlds Strongman titles as the US despite having 300k people to 200m+</p>

<p>So im curious, what, in theory, would constitute a genetic difference to you?</p>

<p>No, not really. Dog breeds are incredibly inbred and thus much more closely related to one another than human &quot;races&quot;. Also, selective breeding allows for the emergence of specific attributes within each breed. Human populations were not artificially selected this way, and indeed it would be very difficult given the long human gestation and maturation times.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>race is like breeds of dogs. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Breeds of dogs exist because isolated populations were specifically bred through century long multi generational endeavors. </p>

<p>99.9% of humans are not isolated to such a degree that there is zero intermixing between &quot;races&quot;, no human population has ever been bred, and even if they were human generations are 10 times as long as a dog generation so any breeding operation would have had to start at least 1,00 years ago, <em>and</em> the members of the populations would have had to be isolated to such a degree that no one could interbreed with them.</p>

<p>I&#39;ll demonstrate why races don&#39;t exist.</p>

<p>Take the &quot;white&quot; race and &quot;West Asian race&quot; (or, if you want, you can lump in all Asians ranging from Australian aboriginals to Japanese to Chinese to Indians to Turks). The greeks belong to the &quot;white&quot; race, and the turks belong to the &quot;west asian&quot; race.</p>

<p>Only, the Greeks and the Turks have been interbreeding for nearly a millenia now. So are the Greeks not white, or are the Turks not West asian? Because at this point the Greeks share more with the Turks than they do the Finnish or the Irish or the French or the Germans, and the Turks likewise share more with the Greeks than they do with the Mongolians or the Chinese or the Arabians or the Indians.</p>

<p>I suppose you might say that the Greeks and the Turks thus belong to a new race that has emerged. But guess what, the Greeks also interbred with the Italians and Albanians and Slavs for over a millennia and the Turks interbred with the Armenians and the Levantines for nearly a millennia. So does this new race also stretch from Italy to the Levantine and Armenia?</p>

<p><em>Well guess what?</em> The Italians have been interbreeding with the Spanish, the Spanish with the French, the French with the Germans, and the Germans with the English, while the Armenians have been interbreeding with the slavs and the persians, who have been interbreeding with the Indians, who have in turn been interbreeding with the Tibetians, who have been interbreeding with the Chinese, who have been interbreeding with the Mongolians.</p>

<p>And of course the Mongolians have been interbreeding with the turks and the slavs.</p>

<p>Genetic distance is an absolute thing and already established science - and whether you want to believe it or not, an Eastern European and a Sub-Saharan African have almost double the distance between them than a n Eastern European and a chimpanzee - yet we only consider the latter to be a sub-species.</p>

<p><strong>For now.</strong> </p>

<p>Whites will be the minority in the US in 30 years. White birth rates are declining in places like Britain, Germany, Australia and France while foreigners with much higher birthrates are moving in by the millions.</p>

<p>Women and Men need each other, but we are different. There&#39;s tons of studies along with common observations that show that. I believe we both have our roles and I believe the more we try to confuse and change those roles, the quicker society will go to hell.</p>

<p>And if you ever sit home at night, praying to Jesus Christ and claim you love the way He loves, you are fooling yourself if you truly believe the things you do.

<p>I don&#39;t see the MSM and the Elites of the world pushing to destroy any other culture but the culture of White people&#39;s. What happens if you criticize Islam/Juadaism vs criticizing Christianity in any of the Western world? You&#39;ll be punished for the first in various ways with some actually getting you fines/jail and the other you aren&#39;t punished for.</p>

<p>Race was something people didn&#39;t use to talk about that much. Now it is something everyone talks about 24/7. If we&#39;re all the same race, as libs would have us believe, this shouldn&#39;t be the case. If we&#39;re not, like the right would have you believe, this is the case. The one fact we know for sure is that the elites want more power, and that minorities tend to vote in ways that will give them such power.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Your people cost $750,000 per person in welfare. As white men are the only demographic to contribute to the bottom line with their taxes totalling $200,000, whereas all others cost, this means that it takes the life work of 4 white men to pay for a single black person. Hispanic people, though a much larger demographic, cost $250,000 per person per lifetime. This is a large part of why we run a deficit each year, and were it not for welfare minority (not even counting the cost of things like prisons, damages done due to extreme rates of violent crime, etc), the average wage would increase by $24,000 per year. If our country is to survive we cannot keep this up. There is another problem compounding that, though: Black people commit 1/2 of all murders, most rapes, and that is even with white men paying for everything they need to live. Imagine what would happen if we one day said &quot;this is unacceptable and unsustainable, so, we&#39;re cutting welfare by 90%&quot;. I think that the 1/2 of all murders would rise exponentially. </p>

<p>How do you propose we solve that? I ask myself that every day. Would you be willing to accept a state of your own; your own independent black nation in, say, Louisiana? An entire state. No? I didn&#39;t think so. How do you propose we solve the hugely, massively problematic welfare problem without increasing the rate at which your people kill? You won&#39;t take a state of your own, you won&#39;t willingly put down the welfare, and we cannot continue to give it to you. So, to my mind, the options are: </p>

<p>1.) Race war. Nobody wants that. It would be terrible and costly and despite all of the posturing, I think you know how it would go down. </p>

<p>2.) Mass deportation. Is it pretty? No. Is it the best solution given the complexity of the problems we <em>must</em> solve? Yes. </p>

<p>Because I know that you will say &quot;I&#39;m not violent and I pay taxes&quot;, I will remind you that exceptions do not disprove rules, and when trying to solve a systemic problem, anecdotes are inadmissible. </p>

<p>Seriously, how do we solve the murder/rape/welfare problems? </p>

<p>The crime stats are from the BJS, the welfare stats are from the USWD. You are choosing to ignore it because it is not comfortable. Do you score around 100 on IQ tests? Awesome. Good for you. You&#39;re beating the odds. Does that mean that black people don&#39;t have an average IQ of 78? No, of course not. Statistics remain true, as all facts do, no matter how we feel about them. </p>

<p>If you can&#39;t address the argument and are unwilling to live in reality as can be measured, we will do it for you, or simple economics will force us all to go down with you. I have never met a black person who ever realistically looks at where they are as a race and why they are there. It&#39;s always &quot;you&#39;re just racists keepin&#39; us down&quot;, or &quot;muh socioeconomic factors&quot;, or what have you, but you never stop and say &quot;maybe people around the world tend to like my race least because of [insert statistics surrounding crime, rape, welfare, etc]&quot;. It is shameful, and to be honest, infuriating to witness such intentional ignorance on such a large scale, especially as it is costing the lives of nearly countless white and black people. You guys tear up entire cities when one black person gets shot for pulling a gun on a cop, but you would just call us &quot;hateful racists&quot; if we acted on the 10s of thousands of dead white people who die at the hands of racist black people. </p>

<p>lol, you&#39;re &quot;one of those.&quot;  Every family has &quot;one of those.&quot;  I can see you now, sitting there, arms crossed with a bent lip.</p>

<p>That&#39;s called a strawman.  Is this how you carry on at family reunions?  I bet you&#39;re a hoot!  </p>

<p>But let me get this right:  Your meanie head uncle who told you to &quot;get a real job and quit bitching; no one owes you anything,&quot; straight doxed himself to you over his fried turkey leg?</p>

<p>I ain&#39;t buying that. </p>

<p>Anyway, I would bait you over my Watergate salad too.</p>

<p>That&#39;s not what I asked.  I&#39;m not here to defend some altright poof ball who&#39;s named himself for a dessert, but it would be interesting to compare that &quot;loser&#39;s&quot; balance sheet to your own.  Which reminds me:</p>

<p>You ignored that question.  Here you are passing judgement on thought criminals, but as far as anyone reading knows you&#39;re sitting at home on probation for your second DWI. </p>

<p>With the elections in 16 and the BLM Movements, it was a time when a lot of people around here went to FB to tell people exactly what they think. This included older members that aren&#39;t particularly fond of black people protesting and made that very clear. It&#39;s the south so it&#39;s a bit more expected but eh. If it makes you feel better than yeah sure you can fantasize about how our reunions go, be my guest</p>

<p>Lol sorry for strawmanning the racist, next time I&#39;ll include his actual arguments, which were a made up infograph and presented no source and a word salad about how Hispanics and black people take up welfare. Invigorating debate right there </p>

<p>Absolutely. The whole point of having kids is to spread your like to the next generations, which is something you can&#39;t do if they are gay, because they won&#39;t be having kids.</p>

<p>Homosexuality is also pushed by the media. It is over-represented(which shows don&#39;t have a gay character now?) so people see it as more natural and will partake in it.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>And apparently, that isn&#39;t as bad as marrying a different race? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Gay people can&#39;t have kids on their own. If I had a gay son, I would at least know that it stops there.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Are you religious by any chance?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Not really:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>I agree with a lot of the concepts. There&#39;s some I don&#39;t agree with.</p></li>
<li><p>I think it&#39;s possible there could be a God though I know 1) humans aren&#39;t as smart as we think we are and 2) the people in power correctly see religion as a threat to their power.</p></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
<p>And the fact you and your family will pass this shit on to another generation saddens me greatly. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Atleast I&#39;m going to have something <strong>to pass over</strong>. I don&#39;t know what your ethnicity is, but the more ethnicities you get involved, the less likely they are to pass on their culture to the next gen. See modern day White America.</p>

<p>Don&#39;t care.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I can&#39;t even fathom how a father could disown their own child over their sexuality or the skin colour of their chosen partner.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I exist. This means my ancestors wanted me to exist, and therefore, likely wanted me to make sure our line continues to exist. Since they can&#39;t speak for themselves anymore, I have to do their job for them. If I had kids, it would be to pass my line onto the next generation. That&#39;s the sole reason. The more races that are introduced into the equation, the more unlikely that is to happen.</p>

<p>Homosexuals can&#39;t have kids, therefore making having a homosexual son or daughter useless to me.</p>

<p>Homosexuals even if they prefer the same sex, can always choose not to act on it. I don&#39;t act on various things I want to do, because I consider the consequences of my actions. I wanted to stay up later last night, but I know if I don&#39;t sleep at the same time everyday, I&#39;ll be more tired. So I chose not to stay up too late.</p>

<p>You seem to think that the solution which minimizes costs while promoting short-term stability is not the one ALREADY IN PLACE.

The murders you site are almost entirely black drug gangs killing one another so they don&#39;t matter to anyone but these communities.</p>

<p>You are being intentionally ignorant, yet again, in order to maintain your comfortable illusion. If black people commit 1/2 of all murders/rapes, and they hate all white people despite our paying for their entire lives, statistically speaking, then if we said &quot;sorry you took all the money&quot;, it would follow logically that their already-violent-nature would increase. Even if it just stayed the same, that they commit 1/2 of all murders alone is inexcusable, but I know you&#39;ll try nonetheless. </p>

<p>You are a very intellectually dishonest person. You are saying that it would cost more to pay for 35 million one-way boat tickets than the <strong>26 trillion dollars</strong> that the current black population will cost, not accounting for new births, not accounting for inflation?

<p>A comforting idea, but again, they commit 1/2 of all murders, 1/2 of all rapes, hate us for all we do for them, and still, your solution is &quot;well just give them more!&quot;. Do I disagree with the wealthy holding the majority of all of the resources and capital the world over? Of course. Does that give black people a pass on their criminality and exorbitant costs both in terms of lives and in terms of squandered wealth?  Of course not. </p>

<p>Again, this figure is completely misleading and mostly shows that of the most wealthy people in our nation, almost none are black. That aside, &quot;one way boat tickets&quot; are the least of the problems involved in forcibly deporting a population of 30+ million people spread out across a nation as large as the US, even assuming the completely cooperation of the entire white citizenry and government.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Damn, you racist ding bats repeatedly prove to be sub par in terms of chart analysis, not to mention that you only have a shaky relationship with the truth. 
Fortunately there are folks of every hue who can comprehend better and don&#39;t feel compelled to lie, but just in case any observers are too busy to double check the data I feel I should provide a slightly more accurate overview of the facts. </p>

<p>First of all, even in terms of the very questionable manipulation of the numbers by your source, you are being false, since your own source clearly indicates that the 700,000 + number you quote is for a married couple, not the per person estimate. Your claim that  white men are the only demographic contributing to the bottom line via taxation is also a bald faced lie, as the charts you provided clearly states that whites (including white women, don&#39;t cut us out just because you can&#39;t find any who want to touch your Lil wiener) contribute just under 76 % of tax revenue which is just under 5% over the 71% that should be expected according to our proportion of the population.<br/>
I&#39;m not going to bother with the creative math used to justify some of the other claims made by your source, I&#39;m only using the raw govt numbers provided. Some interesting ones you conveniently failed to mention is that in terms of overall government resources, Blacks receive a little over 12 % and whites a little over 69% of these resources, which is within 1-2 percentage points of what&#39;s to be expected according to each group&#39;s proportion of the total population. In terms of welfare resources alone, of the slightly over 30% of the overall population who receive welfare benefits, over 25% is white. So if welfare is cut by 90% there will be far more white people scewed by this than anyone else.</p>

<p>Your crime statistics are not relevant as you provide no raw data to back those numbers up, much less any analysis to account for nuances like a bullshit drug war that was systematically used to target men of color (at great profit to the CIA no less), or the great profits acrued by industries that have benefited from the use of cheap prison slave labor, or the fact that black families were systematically blocked from the opportunity to acrue intergenerational wealth via home ownership while these opportunities were subsidized for whites, and the same goes for free college educations, which disproportionally benefitted whites as fully subsidized higher education pretty  much came to an end just as blacks began to be able to attend college in larger numbere, nor account for racially based differences in investment in infrastructure and other factors vital to the chances for achievement held by children from different ethnic populations such as per pupil spending at neighborhood schools, and environmental reclamation projects. There&#39;s no need to bother, Its clearly much more complicated than you will be able to comprehend, and even where you might manage a glimmer of understanding, your willingness to deal with your cognitive dissonance by just citing inflated numbers here, simply ignoring inconvenient data there makes dealing with you any further doubly pointless. What I have written here already isn&#39;t for your worthless ass, that&#39;s a lost cause. It&#39;s for those reading who you hoped to influence with lies and bullshit.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Someones probably going to accuse you of being a neo nazi.</p>

<p>In saying that, &quot;white culture&quot; has a lot of collective genetic homogeneity among many races of European descent, as well as shared epigenetic traits, that allow the &quot;white man&quot; to interface with many elements of modern society more intuitively than races that were conjoined to western society as it evolved.</p>

<p>We literally share many commonalities toward everything from the same digestion, immune systems to psychological structure and personal affinities inside of a society that evolved from our overlapping and interwoven ancestry.</p>

<p>&quot;white culture&quot; has a resoundingly greater similarity to itself (even with discordant elements) than compared with &quot;minority&quot; cultures, coupled with having a much stronger genetic and cultural affinity to its native environment really does homogenize it to quite a great extent.</p>

<p>Simply put- It&#39;s easier being part of a white mass in a society evolved by its own ancestors than for the majority of the minorities (especially in instances where they were oppressed by the &quot;white man&quot;, or experienced incompatibility issues with diseases, substances and social mechanics etc). 
Racial solidarity is much more of an essential part of navigating modern society for many of these groups, rather than the default assimilation that those of european descent are effectively born into.</p>

<p>There is also diminishing racial purity among multigenerational inhabitants of European descent which further challenges a sense of solidarity.</p>

<p>Ultimately it still sucks to be a poor disenfranchised white guy just as bad as any other poor person, the lower class has little inherent benefit of being &quot;white&quot; over another group, advantages become more prevalent from a middle class socio-economic status onward, but these native benefits do exist both genetically and socially (though epigenetic changes to the environment do occur over generations which will mitigate many aspects over time).</p>

<p>I am aware of the nationalist belief that there is an intentional process of &quot;white washing&quot; European culture, defaulting to accusations of racism and racial superiority whenever solidarity is sought. It&#39;s an interesting theory (Germany is a very different place these days..), however I believe that ultimately &quot;white society&quot; homogenizes itself by the genetic, epigenetic and cultural reasons in countries like the US, without the need for a man behind the curtain.</p>

<p>The link right there says the UN declares genocide as mental or physical.</p>

<p>If you have a problem with that definition, you should discuss that with the UN.</p>

<p>LBGT - They genocide themselves because they can&#39;t reproduce naturally.</p>

<p>Black - If the US truly wanted to get rid of them for good, it certainly would have been possible. I think we&#39;ve given them a far better life than they would have in Africa.</p>

<p>Native Americans - Definitely. This proves that the majority can be genocided though.</p>

<p>Asians - We were at War with the Japanese. Totally understood.</p>

<p>P2: Racists judge people by their skin color.</p>

<p>Ok, sure. When weighing in on broad social issues, stick to statistics. Anecdotes are meaningless, and exceptions do not disprove rules. Do I judge individuals before I see their character? Nah. Do I take the time to understand the world around me as can be measured? Yep, and that makes me a &quot;racist&quot; to people like you. </p>

<p>Black people cost <a href="https://i.imgur.com/XNzhquh.png">$750,000 per person in welfare</a>. As white men are the only demographic to contribute to the bottom line, with their lifetime contribution in taxes totalling $200,000, whereas all others cost, this means that it takes the life work of 4 white men to pay for a single black person. Hispanic people, though a much larger demographic, cost $250,000 per person per lifetime. This is a large part of why we run a deficit each year, and were it not for welfare minority (not even counting the cost of things like prisons, damages done due to extreme rates of violent crime, etc), the average wage would increase by $24,000 per year. If our country is to survive we cannot keep this up. There is another problem compounding that, though: Black people commit 1/2 of all murders, most rapes, and that is even with white men paying for everything they need to live. Imagine what would happen if we one day said &quot;this is unacceptable and unsustainable, so, we&#39;re cutting welfare by 90%&quot;. I think that the 1/2 of all murders would rise exponentially. </p>

<p>You can &quot;but that&#39;s racist tho&quot; all the way to the downfall of our civilization, and a part of me believes you <em>wish</em> for that.

<p>So the question then is why is this the case? The answer from racists seems to be that white people are inherently superior to other races, whereas most other people understand that when your socioeconomic standing when you&#39;re born determines so much of your life trajectory. </p>

<p>It&#39;s easy to not be violent when you live in a safe, comfortable household with good earnings and good schooling and nutrition and on and on and on - all things that white people have (on average) at a much greater level than black people. </p>

<p>These statistics hold true in every country they are measured in. It is, actually, due to the difference in black brain structure such as having a much more pronounced brain stem which leads to greater instinct and thus poorer impulse control. Jeeze you guys want to stay if your fantasy land so badly it hurts. </p>

<p>And complaining about &quot;unfair advantages&quot; given to black people is like complaining that we give a ladder to the guy we kicked into a hole before a track meet. </p>

<p>Nope, it&#39;s <em>actual</em> racism. Enforced and calculated and indeed conspiratorial racism.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>I can and regularly do say that white people are far more oppressed even in the US than black people. White Christians are regularly listed as the single most persecuted demographic the world over. You believe fairytales. </p>

<p>You. are. not. answering. the. question.</p>

<p>In fact, you&#39;re going in a circle with your justifications. So managers don&#39;t hire black people because they&#39;re incompetent, which you believe to be true because they are black, not because of institutional racism, which doesn&#39;t exist because black people are inferior.</p>

<p>It&#39;s just a series of non-sequitur. A black job applicant equally qualified with a white job applicant do not receive the same treatment and you have not explained how this happens without identifying systemic prejudices. </p>

<p>Are ASVABs racist? Is the military racist for not allowing over 1/2 of all black people to join because an IQ of under 85 does not allow a person to follow orders effectively?</p>

<p>A black dude who goes his entire life being coddled and forced through whatever system he is going through? Yes. Hiring managers are not stupid. They see what works and what doesn&#39;t. You have never run a business. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>But why are blacks more poor?  Why are they less educated? Why are their neighborhoods less safe? Why is their food less nutritious? </p>

<p>You just blame all of their problems on their quality of life. Yes you are correct, manu blacks have a shit quality of life. The question is why. If someone gets food stamps, why can’t they cook homemade meals?  </p>

<p>If a black kid can’t focus on school because he has to worry about the gangs all around him, the question is why are there gangs all around him?  When a poor white person spends 20% of their income on cigarettes and lottery tickets, we don’t blame lack of education. You don’t need a college degree or even a middle school diploma to know that that’s fucking dumb. But with blacks, every single thing that’s fucked up with their society, we pretend like someone mythical force created this society for them and is holding them back. </p>

<p>They created these societies!  You can’t blame blacks or Hispanics for a trailer park being a shithole, and rightfully so. But when looking at black ghettos, don’t you dare blame the inhabitants for the trash, crime, and violence. That’s the fault of white people 200 years ago. </p>

<p>Do you not realize that the Civil Rights movement occurred in the 1960s? Do you not realize that to this day if you&#39;re a black job applicant with equal qualifications to a white job applicant you are still not as likely to get a call back? Do you not realize that black people and white people smoke marijuana at the same rate, yet black people are multitudes more likely to be arrested for it? </p>

<p>How can you be so naive as to believe that black people are not impacted by the past? The past doesn&#39;t disappear - the effects of institutionalized bigotry are long-lasting are large. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>We’re all humans. The differences between us all are slight when placed next to the similarities. The general culture of shaming the “white” race is the natural return swing of the pendulum from all the previous centuries of  white race cultural dominance. History favors the victors. What we know of the past, primarily comes from the writings of conquering “white” scholars. But just because they control the narrative does not mean they control the actual truth. The actual truth is we are all human. We all come from this planet. And we all owe it to ourselves to find a way to get past our differences and learn to work together. </p>

<p>so yes, there are &quot;white people&quot;, as much as there are black people or irish people or human beings.  it&#39;s all just classifications of things that exist.</p>

<p>the place your parents were born doesn&#39;t matter.  that&#39;s the actual truth.  what they looked like, their stories and culture and beliefs and traditions - none of that is you.  it&#39;s ignorant to perpetrate the belief that any of this stuff is actually important.  it&#39;s a choice.  it&#39;s a choice to act however you want to act.  it should be based on what is intelligent and wise and skillful, and on nothing else.  but I don&#39;t know if humanity can ever reach the level where such a concept is actually popular.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>We don&#39;t live in those countries anymore. Most American &#39;White&#39; people are a mishmash of dozens of ethnicities. I&#39;m maybe 30-40% Irish, and sure I took an Irish history class in college, I know the family crest of my last name &amp; whatnot but... I frankly don&#39;t really give a shit about any of that. It&#39;s charming information about one of the many &#39;Tribes&#39; I&#39;m from, but has no impact on my life. I&#39;m just not too concerned with the past, or traditional stuff in general. I think it hold most people back. Move on, evolve. Learn about the past, understand it, but ffs don&#39;t let it restrain you from evolving &amp; living in the <em>present</em>.</p>

<p>If what you are <em>really</em> complaining about is racial mixing, well then Americans are the wrong group to try to rally, as it&#39;s far too late for us. I guess maybe I&#39;m too &#39;progressive&#39; on the issue, but it just seems silly &amp; antiquated to waste any time moaning about this issue, especially in this country. Maybe this would have more traction in a Swedish subreddit (more like an Aryan one methinks), but I don&#39;t know what you want from Americans. We&#39;re already damaged goods as far as this issue is concerned ;-)</p>

<p>What’s funny is, if OP ran into me on the streets he would automatically assume I’m “100%”white and start yammering on about <em>white people this and brown people that.</em> I mean, my skin is white but I have Japanese features that a lot of people don’t notice until they find out.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s just the nature of the US. It&#39;s not only white people, it&#39;s everyone. The US is unique in the world in that people here do not hold strongly to any traditional tribal identity but rather racial identity. This is not because of some attempt to make white people forget who they are, though. It&#39;s because we are no longer of the same tribe we came from. You are not italian, irish, english, norwegian etc anymore after you are born in america. You are america. So now the only traits that you can deeply identify with are being whatever race or color you are on a surface level and where you are from (the US). </p>

<p>This is the case no matter where your ancestors are from. If you are black in america you don&#39;t consider yourself of a certain tribe or region from africa. You are just black. If you are asian you are not chinese or japanese (except in a few places that have strong ties to their cultures like china town areas or korean and vietnamese areas on west coast etc).</p>

<p>There are of course more exception to this but that is the rule. This is also why a lot of people are skeptical of some muslim and middle eastern people. Because many of these groups do not want to assimilate and identify as being american or british or whatever. They want to move here and benefit from our societies and economies and continue identifying as whatever they were before they came to the west. They expect our countries to compromise and accept them while they don&#39;t compromise at all. Again, this does not apply to all muslims and middle easterners but it is a great number of them.</p>

<p>The point is that people who &quot;lose&quot; their tribal identity do so in a natural course unless they refuse to. If you want to continue identifying as scottish or whatever then go ahead and connect back to your roots. But it&#39;s not like you are really losing anything. America has its own culture and has built its own tribal identity. So naturally people living here adopt that because it is what they grow up with. And most people in this country are of such mixed blood that they can&#39;t really identify with another country anyway. White people in the US specifically are just called white because they are not irish or italian or whatever, they are 10%, 20%, 30% and so on of a bunch of ethnicities and they are from america so it doesn&#39;t really make sense to say you are anything but white. And even then a lot of people love to say &quot;I&#39;m 25% irish&quot; or whatever even though it doesn&#39;t really mean anything.</p>

<p>All this shit about &quot;preserving our heritage&quot; and &quot;not forgetting our our roots&quot; is tribalist nonsense. </p>

<p>As a for instance, I have an Irish friend, born and raised in Ireland, and she speaks just a few words of Irish. Is she worried about the loss of her heritage or culture? Fuck no. Because she&#39;s a rational adult and knows that her identity is not defined by the place she was born, or her parent&#39;s religion, or her family&#39;s feuds, or the political beliefs of the people she grew up with.

    <div class="md"><p>In the Year of Our Lord Two Thousand and Twenty the immoral, degenerate, atheist, and anti-white behemoth known as the United States of America has destroyed all semblance of European culture. Not only has Christianity been forbidden no one even knows how to practice it any more - the people&#39;s brains have been turned to a uniform gray slurry by the corrosive multicultural poisons of knowing a second language or eating Mexican food sometimes.</p>

<p>Alexander the who? Washingwhat? Napoleon? NAPOLEON? ALL ARE SACRIFICED AT THE ALTAR OF MAYBE TREATING MINORITIES SLIGHTLY BETTER. And <em>no one</em> remembers their names! They have been <strong>EXPUNGED</strong> from the history books! SEE FOR YOURSELF! Open up a world history book printed in this country and you will find <em>NOT ONE SINGLE TRACE</em> of the West. What will you find? I DON&#39;T KNOW I DON&#39;T READ HISTORY BOOKS. But you won&#39;t find Aristotle, that&#39;s for sure.</p>

<p>In a span of 3-4 generations white men went from having all of the power to just most of it. AN INCONCEIVABLE AND HORRID AFFRONT TO EVERYTHING I - ER SORRY I MEANT EVERYTHING THIS NATION HOLDS DEAR. Did you know that in 1950 all you had to do to have a house in the suburbs was be a sub-par white man? Do you know why that is? It isn&#39;t because a post-WW2 globe had all of it&#39;s major industrial hubs destroyed by a multi-sided war leaving America&#39;s factories unscathed - NO SIREE BOB! IT WAS BECAUSE MEN WERE MEN AND WOMEN WERE WOMEN AND YOU COULD CALL A BLACK PERSON A NIGGER AND THEY JUST HAD TO FEEL SAD AND TAKE IT.</p>

<p>And the worst part about all of this is no one cares! They&#39;d rather listen to the engaging beats and lyrics of Pulitzer Prize Winning rapper Kendrick Lamar. It&#39;s sad but I believe in us. If we try, we can get rid of all of these terrible outside influences and go back to living like Polish people in 1587, which as we all know is universally agreed to be the year Polish culture was it&#39;s most authentic.</p>

<p>(This stuff is deranged but I&#39;ll tell ya it is fun to write)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Your people cost $750,000 per person in welfare. As white men are the only demographic to contribute to the bottom line with their taxes totalling $200,000, whereas all others cost, this means that it takes the life work of 4 white men to pay for a single black person. Hispanic people, though a much larger demographic, cost $250,000 per person per lifetime. This is a large part of why we run a deficit each year, and were it not for welfare minority (not even counting the cost of things like prisons, damages done due to extreme rates of violent crime, etc), the average wage would increase by $24,000 per year. If our country is to survive we cannot keep this up. There is another problem compounding that, though: Black people commit 1/2 of all murders, most rapes, and that is even with white men paying for everything they need to live. Imagine what would happen if we one day said &quot;this is unacceptable and unsustainable, so, we&#39;re cutting welfare by 90%&quot;. I think that the 1/2 of all murders would rise exponentially. </p>

<p>How do you propose we solve that? I ask myself that every day. Would you be willing to accept a state of your own; your own independent black nation in, say, Louisiana? An entire state. No? I didn&#39;t think so. How do you propose we solve the hugely, massively problematic welfare problem without increasing the rate at which your people kill? You won&#39;t take a state of your own, you won&#39;t willingly put down the welfare, and we cannot continue to give it to you. So, to my mind, the options are: </p>

<p>1.) Race war. Nobody wants that. It would be terrible and costly and despite all of the posturing, I think you know how it would go down. </p>

<p>2.) Mass deportation. Is it pretty? No. Is it the best solution given the complexity of the problems we <em>must</em> solve? Yes. </p>

<p>Because I know that you will say &quot;I&#39;m not violent and I pay taxes&quot;, I will remind you that exceptions do not disprove rules, and when trying to solve a systemic problem, anecdotes are inadmissible. </p>

<p>Seriously, how do we solve the murder/rape/welfare problems? </p>
