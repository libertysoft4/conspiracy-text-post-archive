    <div class="md"><p>Because I think humans willingly engage in activities that put the survival of the species at risk. We need to weed out these behaviors that include but aren’t limited to crime, drug use, porn and masturbation, sex with strangers, fatherlessness, etc etc. We often don’t hold people accountable in America because there is so much individualism and not much unity. Also I think it would be wise to forcibly suppress individuals that threaten this order but I also agree with the 7th amendment of no cruel and unusual punishment so we can avoid Gulag like labor camps </p>

<p>It was not sarcasm and I know it probably sounds like sarcasm cause it is not a common idea held by people in America but it is very common around the world and very common throughout history. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is stupid. </p>

<p>Who gets to be the arbitrator is the toughest question to answer. Tough question to answer but hopefully a religious, caring, smart, strong leader and his administration. Ideally have a certain set of rights that no leader can violate no matter what. </p>

<p>We need to have laws and punish people for harming themselves just as we punish people for harming others. The point being is we don’t want people acting like degenerate, low-life idiots with no drive and no ambitions and no loyalty to their community. Do you want your neighbors jacked up on opioids? I mean theyre not harming others right? Wrong. These type of behaviors lead to a society with more crime, less productivity and ultimately more suffering. Think of it as like a ripple effect. If more people are on drugs and masturbate all day that means more people will be less productive at work. That means the quality of goods and services will go down and it will be much harder to maintain a good standard of living for yourself and your family and it can put unnecessary pressure on you to provide. Then the standard of living will fall for everyone and we will devolve into a 3rd world nation. We must punish people for engaging in these types of behaviors, because it certainly puts more people at risk. And lessens the quality and value of our nation and its communities. </p>

<p>Understand? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah the distribution to corporations is &quot;socialism for the super rich&quot; which is more accurately just crony-type-capitalism. 
Like socialized single payer universal healthcare (not for profit) VS Obamacare (cronyist expensive crap, big pharma/insurance companies profit handsomely from tax payers and we still get hugely ripped off on drug prices and services!)</p>

<p>Imagine what could be if we used tax money on the people rather than the corporate profiteering scams. New infrastructure would be built, new jobs, more efficient programs, better education, less war, etc.</p>

<p>Kleptocracy and oligarchy sound about right. :/
Not saying getting money out of politics is the end all be all,
but it would definitely help us drain the swamp. But secret societies also need to be kicked out,
FED nationalized, corporate media boycotted/pirate streamed, etc.
Organizing at the local level (grassroots) would be helpful too.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Barebones welfare (e.g. foodbanks) and crony capitalist profiteering (e.g. Obamacare) is not getting your tax money&#39;s worth, it&#39;s a cronyist scam.
They&#39;re social programs sure, but almost all economies have some form of socialist concept/policies (roads, police, education, social security, etc.) but they don&#39;t qualify
for socialist since they don&#39;t reach the threshold.</p>

<p>The amount of socialism in those social programs is very little, i.e. disappointingly insufficient and the way they&#39;re run is deliberately inefficient. A greater proportion of our taxes should go towards things that help the people (education, transport, infrastructure, healthcare, etc.) and NOT corporate crony profit at our expense (insurance/big pharma-Obamacare).</p>

<p>I&#39;m just saying no one would categorize it as socialist
since a huge amount of our taxes go towards to the elite (crony capitalistic social programs).
Social programs are sabotaged my friend. Much better forms can exist. Getting money out
of politics is probably one of the needed steps in ensuring politicians do
things that benefit the people, rather than corporations/central banks/wallstreet.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Cool. I&#39;d just avoid the use of &quot;Jew&quot; and just stick with zionist or Khazarian mafia....I read something about Khazaria converting to Judaism hundreds of years ago. I&#39;m no expert on Judaism but this makes me think normal Jews are being used as a scapegoat for the political zionists. Or I could be completely wrong, I still don&#39;t get why Israel is important to the elites. Is it just an intermediate part of the end agenda? They&#39;ll eventually screw over Israel too? If you know anything that could clear it up, let me know.</p>

<p>Although....this could be a clue:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.energyenhancement.org/WWIII-World-War-3-Albert-Pike.png">http://www.energyenhancement.org/WWIII-World-War-3-Albert-Pike.png</a></p>

<p>But then again this is Pike, so who knows if there&#39;s an element of disinfo/half truth in there.
I&#39;m particularly confused about why these Luciferian weirdos with their NWO agenda are threatened by atheism and Christianity. The waters are already muddied.
He also said something about WW2 which sounded legit but the framing seemed odd as he mentioned &quot;....taking advantage of the difference between the fascists and political zionists&quot; and using Hitler as an excuse to create Israel. It&#39;s like these groups are merely canon fodder using divide and conquer to control the world step by step.
That&#39;s my guess anyway. It just reaks of satanic shit (no idea if it differs from Luciferianism).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Socialism is a less agressive communism with less state control over companies but some state owned companies- often in oil ore mining. Most rich democratic countreys are socialistic but rather burocratic. Capitalism represents greed more than a financial status. The modern society relies on capitalism. For goods sake, the communists are clever capitalists cince they keep all the market under the control of one organisation that profits- the government. The fucking nonsense about all ecuals is mere bullshit. Nationalism is what people resort to in the time of need and the ideologies of eatch countrey are very different. Unlike the communistic ideology nationalistic ideology is genuinely believed by free will by the people . For example  the rise of nazi germany was caused by the peoples cry a strong leader. So that’s it. Written on mobile with many mistakes sry!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Most of my living family lived under post Stalin communism. 
They loved it.</p>

<p>Never locked our doors. No homeless. Everyone had a place to live.</p>

<p>It was considered a shame to be unemployed and the people in your area helped to make sure you had a job.</p>

<p>Youth groups kept the neighborhoods clean just like the Cub &amp; Girl scouts used to do in the United States.</p>

<p>There was no jail in their town of over 700,000 people.</p>

<p>People weren&#39;t obsessed with buying shiny crap all the time.</p>

<p>A good time was considered barbeque making shaslik/corn on the cob &amp; drinking ice cold kvass.</p>

<p>People knew their neighbors &amp; the boss of the place you worked at
lived in nearly the same nice conditions as their workers.</p>

<p>It it was pretty good. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Money/currency is a token we use for trading our labor or property. When that token is received without trade for labor or property it screws the whole system up. That is why the communism stage is needed so some bureaucrat can micromanage/manipulate all aspects of the economic system to fix the problems created by socialism. That is why socialism/communism doesn&#39;t work. Most problems in capitalism come from monopolies or encroaching socialism/communism.   </p>

    <div class="md"><p>First off, with all the doublespeak and new speak this may be a hard subject.</p>

<p>Capitalism and Communism are the same. He who has the capital (ie. resources, money, power) makes the rules. Communism hides behind a &#39;government&#39;; Capitalism hides behind a &#39;market&#39;. In reality they&#39;re both just part of the distraction/illusion of choice. It is part of a deeper hole that you should follow for awhile.</p>

<p>Free trade and Capitalism are not synonyms. Free trade is Liberty of two consenting adults to buy/sell/trade WHATEVER they want.</p>

<p>Anarchy would lead to an exponentially stronger Capitalism/Communism. </p>

<p>Socialism is either a Marx style lie that leads to Communism; Or Nation-Socialism like Germany. Either way we live in a sociality that we all know needs certain thing to function properly. We all chip in together to obtain these things: fire fighters, justice system, roads, ect...</p>

<p>With all that said. Nothing works because the &#39;evil&#39; in this world takes our best ideas, puts a spin on them, twisting the idea around enough to hurt us. All the while using their doublespeak to confuse us. </p>

<p>I hope we can all snap out of this nightmare before it&#39;s too late.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Because I think humans willingly engage in activities that put the survival of the species at risk. We need to weed out these behaviors that include but aren’t limited to crime, drug use, porn and masturbation, sex with strangers, fatherlessness, etc etc. We often don’t hold people accountable in America because there is so much individualism and not much unity. Also I think it would be wise to forcibly suppress individuals that threaten this order but I also agree with the 7th amendment of no cruel and unusual punishment so we can avoid Gulag like labor camps </p>

<p>It was not sarcasm and I know it probably sounds like sarcasm cause it is not a common idea held by people in America but it is very common around the world and very common throughout history. </p>
