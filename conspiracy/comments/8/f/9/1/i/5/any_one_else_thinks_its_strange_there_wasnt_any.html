    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m 100% sure no peace won&#39;t come out of this. NK leaders have been pulling this shit regularly to regain popularity since forever. They talk about wanting peace, then lay down some crazy conditions for it to happen, and ofc, peace &quot;offer&quot; gets rejected. Then thanks to the total control of media they have, they can twist this as much as they want to show how others are evil and how <strong>they</strong> are the good guys protecting the population against the enemy.</p>

<p>Getting SK president to move into NK for pictures were a huge hint at this happening, this is definitely going to be twisted as &quot;we even invited them on our land, but they rejected our hospitality&quot;.</p>

They need to learn to open up and loosen the hell up and stop following agendas narratives and propogranda so much..

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>agendas narratives and propaganda </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Totally.  Here&#39;s what it looks like...</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Kim Jung Un is signaling peace and all I see on t.v. is Cosby and the Russian investigation. What is happening?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Official MSM narrative is:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Kim is a nut job</p></li>
<li><p>NK is a rogue nuclear power.</p></li>
<li><p>NK and SK are mortal enemies... technically at war since the Korean War.</p></li>
<li><p>US military presence is absolutely required to guarantee safety of SK and &quot;maintain stability&quot;</p></li>
</ul>

<p>So now we&#39;ve got this top level meeting between NK and SK. This is taking place without any visible input from the US and seems to have been initiated by the North Koreans. Overall tone seems to be that Kim wants to take things down a notch and end the technical state of war between North and South.</p>

<p>My guess is that the Deep State and their MSM mouthpieces have been caught off guard by this development. It doesn&#39;t fit in with the current narrative and they haven&#39;t yet decided what the new one should be.</p>

<p>So instead of just reporting the truth, they&#39;re staying quiet until they&#39;ve had enough time to come up with a new narrative.</p>

<p>This makes so much fucking sense haha oh my god and describes the radio static from most main stream &quot;news&quot; <em>cough propaganda cough</em> stations as they quickly scatter like roaches in the light as they figure out what the fuck to do now.</p>

<p>Good god thank you for helping me understand that. Awful awful energy that is... Trying to control stuff in that way with such a wide audience.. How irresponsible of media to sell out like that and become controlled in the voice of fear</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m in Korea but only have the Korean ability of a young child. I tried to watch an English stream on my Apple TV from any of the main news apps but only saw the same Cosby garbage/brief stories on what President Moon is serving Kim (Japan is pissed because the mango mousse depicted Dokdo, a disputed island territory). So, I just watched it live on KBS. It started at 10am over here, which would only be 9pm EST, so I was surprised it wasn&#39;t being broadcast. There were several youtube streams but I was too busy to seek those out. It was really interesting though. Kim walked Moon across the border, into the Northern territory, holding hands. Kim looked extremely out of breath just walking though. Like about to die out of breath.  </p>

It could have been live but they pushed it off till today. Our country lost many men fighting that war and millions of Koreans in both the North and South died as a result of Kim&#39;s grandfather. I wanted them to at least show it. The news can talk about Alfie for weeks, I watched William and Kate bring home their baby live on CNN.

<p>The cable news networks make programming decisions almost entirely on the basis of RATINGS. If they didn&#39;t cover something, it&#39;s because they could make more money covering something else. If there was a tornado in Nebraska they&#39;d cover it if it got better ratings.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The Japan-South Korea alliance mostly exists because it was forced to exist in an environment where the USSR and Communist Chinese were right next door. South Korea and Japan still get into arguments about comfort women and territorial disputes over tiny islands, but they at least have occasional talks about it. North Korea is even more anti-Japan and has kidnapped Japanese citizens in the past and they launched missile tests over Japanese territory. North Korea and Japan don&#39;t talk about it. In fact, I don&#39;t think Japan even officially recognizes North Korea&#39;s existence. So Abe (prime minster of Japan) sees both Koreas getting along wonders what it means for the Japan-South Korea alliance, because despite their differences, South Korea is probably still Japan&#39;s best friend in the region.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>They won&#39;t broadcast anything that could in any way be construed as a victory for the Trump administration.</p>

<p>Obama&#39;s administration was offered North Korean nuclear disarmament several times. North Korea asked for them to stop skirting the border with US strategic bombers. That was their only request.</p>

<p>Obama turned the offer down.</p>

<p>Trump isn&#39;t posturing on the NK border. NK and SK are now resolving their issues. Big surprise.</p>

<p>It&#39;s almost like the USA was directly preventing the consolidation of North and South Korea isn&#39;t it?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>And if Obama <em>had</em> allowed the two countries to work it out, he would have demanded he be there for the photo op. </p>

<p>Meanwhile President Trump is letting the two nations work out <em>their</em> issues. </p>

<p>Trump deserves a peace prize more than anyone else in at least the last quarter century. Won’t happen though for obvious reasons. </p>

Friday, 9:30 AM it’s prime time Thursday night here. Anyway, just something I noticed. If it came in live for everyone else on their major cable channels, great!</p>
