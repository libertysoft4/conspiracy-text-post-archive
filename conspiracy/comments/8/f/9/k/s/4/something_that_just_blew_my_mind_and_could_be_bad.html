Their AI, no doubt fed with faulty data to begin with (biased and/or downright rigged polls), had her chances of winning at near 100%. So much for AI taking over the world.

AI will be the master of the logical playing field. But human intelligence is quite capable of developing &quot;different logic&quot; to deal with the need to survive.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Only as predictable as you allow yourself to be. It&#39;s certainly easier to come to some conclusions concerning to what extent your actions can be predicted in advance by data mining and having more specific details about you, but not <em>categorically more</em> information than could be gleaned by simply watching you, following you around, taking note of your personal habits, lifestyle, who your friends are and the kind of interactions you have with others, etc. </p>

<p>By and large it&#39;s an effort to identify whether or not you&#39;re a good prospect to buy some commercial product that can be directly pitched at you rather than hoping you simply stumble upon it in some more general context. But just because you&#39;re a good candidate to buy it doesn&#39;t mean that you that will. Moreover, knowing that they&#39;ve identified you by spying on your electronic footprints might make you rule them out altogether no matter how much you might have liked their product.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What if we&#39;re <em>in</em> the simulation right now? There has been a ton of popular scifi shows with episodes around that theme recently, like Doctor Who or The X-Files. In Doctor Who The Vatican guarded a super secret text in their library called The Veritas that made anyone who read it commit suicide. It turned out The Veritas provided a simple test to prove the readers that they were in a simulation and that their existence in it helped an evil alien race gather intel on our behavior and to see how we react to things and test how an attack on Earth would pan out, so staying alive was actively harming their real-world counterparts and Earth itself.</p>

<p>CERN also got a copy of The Veritas and they all killed themselves. So an episode with CERN, Simulation Theory, Vatican and Pope Benedict IX, evil demonic aliens <em>that require permission</em> from the human race to take over them etc. Hits way too many marks for stuff talked about here to be just a harmless scifi-episode. Feels like predictive programming. Doctor Who usually doesn&#39;t do shit like this. Plus they presented The Vatican/Pope and CERN in a very positive light. Plus it&#39;s filled with Social &quot;Justice&quot; Bullshit (aka black lipstick lesbians and The Doctor insulting white people every episode).</p>

<p>What the fuck are TPTB up to?? Seriously. What are they doing? Why are they so abrasive about this shit now? They used to be extremely subtle about shit like this in the 1980s and 1990s but now they just straight up hit you with this shit like they don&#39;t care. What are they trying to achieve? What are they speeding up towards by being so obvious?</p>
