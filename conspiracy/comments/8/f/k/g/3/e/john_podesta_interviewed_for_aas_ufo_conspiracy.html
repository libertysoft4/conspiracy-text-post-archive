<p>Apparently you don&#39;t think people wipe pizza grease off their mouths and leave napkins with cum on laying around. </p>

<p>Apparently you think it&#39;s a sexual activity that children go swimming. </p>

<p>Art is art and there&#39;s no proof he did anything to the Madeline girl.</p>

<p>Playing dominos on pizza? Once again republicans show their true colors here. Now instead of a food code word it&#39;s actually a board game code word list now. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Look at NXIUM, look at Epsteins Occult island, look at the names in Epsteins black book.</p>

<p>Got some snippy come back for those?</p>

<p>What about the Bohemian Grove Owl Worship, the same Owl on Epsteins Lolita island?</p>

<p>The dozens of Haitian orphans being smuggled out of the country to a Orphanage that doesnt exist, the fact that the smuggler, Laura Silsby, is deeply associated to the clintons, and was never charged, and now works for the fucking company that controls AMBER ALERTS?</p>

<p>Alefantis and his large amount of weirdness and satanic followers was just the jumping off point for investigation into occultic Elite pedophilia.</p>

<p>And if you have actually bothered looking into all the evidence and still maintain this opinion you are quite literally not worth conversing with as your brain is either 40% fluoride or you are intentionally trying to piss people off with no regard for the truth</p>

<p>On the off chance neither of those things are true or there are lurkers who find your mindless drivel convincing you might want to read this executive summary of PG</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Out of all the Epstein name drops, I&#39;ve never seen a picture of Epstein and Bill Clinton.</p>

<p>I have however seen multiple pictures of Trump and Epstein.</p>

<p>I have looked into your &quot;evidence&quot; and it&#39;s biased as all hell. Your conclusion is the people are pedophiles and you frame things to reinforce the conclusion. </p>

<p>I see a bunch of people accusing others of being a pedophile because they use pedo code words themselves. So they look for it in every bit of common speech. </p>

<p>As for Haitian orphans. The only explanation is that you must be wrong about it. Besides there&#39;s a bigger connection to churches that has not been looked at in that case as she was also with &quot;missionaries&quot;. </p>

<p>Yeah I remember the silly evidence. Pictures like this must get the crowd going yeah? <a href="http://archive.is/hPsLM">http://archive.is/hPsLM</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is SAD, I wont say what I think cus rule 10, but I find it nearly impossible to believe a real person could hold this opinion, </p>

<blockquote>
<p>On January 29, 2010, a group of ten American Baptist missionaries from Idaho attempted to cross the Haiti-Dominican Republic border with 33 Haitian children, most of whom were not orphans and had families. The group, known as the New Life Children’s Refuge,[1] did not have proper authorization for transporting the children and were arrested on kidnapping charges.</p>

<p>the days following the group&#39;s initial arrest, Dominican Jorge Puello falsely portrayed himself as the group&#39;s lawyer.[26] Puello later acknowledged that he is under investigation for sex trafficking in El Salvador and wanted in the United States for smuggling people across the Canada–US border. Puello was incarcerated for short terms in both Canada and the US.[27][28] He was arrested in the Dominican Republic on March 18.[29] On August 18, 2010, the Dominican Supreme Court authorized Puello&#39;s extradition to the United States where he was sentenced to 37 months of prison in June 2011.</p>

<p>Hillary and Bill Clinton provided assistance to Laura Silsby, resulting in a reduced sentence for child trafficking. His sentence and accusations were reduced after a speech by Bill Clinton.</p>

<p>Who is Laura Silsby and why is she now working at Alert Sense, which provides technology for Amber Alerts and FEMA Emergency response systems under the name Laura Galyer? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>You are a fucking pedo apologist intentional contorting statements and performing olypmic level mental gymnastics and not engaging with damming statements.</p>

<p>Anyone else notice how he deflected the confirmed Epstein PEDO ISLAND WITH OCCULT STATUES AND NAMES OF VISITORS LOGGED and turned it into some anti-trump drivel?</p>

<p>I never claimed to be pro-trump or that he wasnt involved so why do you fall back to that rhetoric?</p>

<p>How do you explain Epsteins connection to presidential / elite retreat bohemian grove?</p>

<p>Again I shouldnt be arguing with you as you know the truth you are not looking for evidence, you knew from the beginning that there was NOTHING that could be said to sway your opinion, you had a stance that you are endorsing on <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> and you will continue to push that stance no matter how wrong you are proven to be</p>
