<p>&quot;Greetings</p>

<p>I come from Germany. My introduction maybe somewhat lacking but i&#39;m not a great fan of lying to people so here&#39;s what i have to share.</p>

<p>No personal details nor details of any sort.</p>

<p>I&#39;m an employee in an educational facility of sorts. Together with my co-workers we&#39;re engaged in what ypu&#39;d call remote viewing with a specific goal of targetting and describing ancient civilizations.</p>

<p>The goal itself is to provide our benefactors with crucial information, technological and historical artifacts and whatever data might be useful commercially or otherwise.</p>

<p>On a fun night we&#39;ve decided to provide our initiative with a little leak.</p>

<p>You may ask whatever you want concerning old history and ancient civilizations, historical or beyond. If its covered by our work you will get an answer, if not then no.</p>

<p>Sumer, Babylon and beyond, ask away, someone will log in every day for an hour or so to answer those questions.</p>

<p>This Team have answered almost all questions in detail and in quick response times. over 300 pages off what could be the most important collection of information about our ancient history&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>For starters ;)</p>

<p>We&#39;re the third human civilization to have high technology on a global level.</p>

<p>The number of civilizations that reached some level of technology below ours is much larger, none of them were global however.</p>

<p>The entire span of human civilized history as counted by the broad human genus is approximately 150.000 years.</p>

<p>The total number and the time span is too large to elaborate.</p>

<p>There have been two major civilizations, first centered in a region of Antarctica, once warm - today covered in ice. This civlization was both global and advanced.</p>

<p>It was destroyed by an impact of a small comet that caused a global firestorm and destabilized our planets geology some 50.000 years ago. The remnants of this impact are evident in a layer of ash in India, the comet exploded directly above this continent.</p>

<p>The second civilization, much closer to ours both in technology and lifestyle though still above our level destroyed itself in a global war some 32.000 years ago.</p>

<p>The final destruction was caused by a rapid submerging of the final remnant of Atlantis some 12.300 years ago. Human civilization by then was less advanced than we are though still possesing a sophisticated and significant level of achievement, also enjoying some leftover technologies with capacity to maintain them but without the ability to reproduce them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Neanderthal people? </p>

<p>Smarter than us but devoid of imagination. They built significant civilizations with an extreme level of social sophistication but their technological progress was extremely slow. Also their technologies were marked by an attempt to move away from mechanical and utilize natural forces and resources in ways that provided them with efficiency and achievements that at one point rivaled our own.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>examples of any of the advanced technologies?</p>

<p>You would have to name a period. During the second high period of civilization solar power, magnetic propulsion, artificially grown crystalline hardware were commonplace.</p>

<p>One major difference was that most energy was renewable and what consummable fuel existed was significantly more efficient than ours.</p>

<p>Among the artifacts from the final high period of civilization there is a prelavence of devices and appliances that have few moving parts or lack them alltogether deaspite their technological nature.</p>

<p>During the later iterations of civilization much technology was lost but the appliances to carve and transport stone were retained due to simple means required.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Do you know for what reason the global war erupted during the second civilization?</p>

<p>One side believed in an enslavement of all minor human species to use them as tools. The other did not. Both sides consisted of major nations and minor allies with imperial ambitions.</p>

<p>The desitre to dominate led to conflict. The inability to break the stalemate led to the use of weapons of mass destruction and a mutually assured destruction scenario.</p>

<p>The participants on one side were people from the land mass in centre of Atlantic along its ridge now submerged, their allies who lived on the plains of western Europe around british isles - today flooded, people who lived on and around Cuba and in the Americas.</p>

<p>On the other side were the nations and states that inhabited areas of today&#39;s Indo-China including the portions of land now submerged, large part of Africa and mediterrenean as well as parts of today&#39;s Black Sea coast.</p>

<p>All belligerents were wiped out, on both sides.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Did you view the moon landings? What really happened and what was the real goal? Did the moon missions really stop or are they done out of the public eye now?</p>

<p>They stopped. The race to the moon started after the various goverments realised that it&#39;s the last repository of functional technology from previous periods.</p>

<p>They&#39;re no longer allowed to land on the moon, also more caches of usable artifacts have been discovered on earth making it cheaper to appropriate them here.</p>

<p>There&#39;s examples of technology still present and functioning on the moon that if brought to earth might prove to be a global threat, everyone realised it&#39;s not safe to continue, nobody wished for an extinction level event.</p>

<p>South America, subterrenean shelters in the Andes, repositories in Giza, ruins in Bolivia, remains of defensive installations and settlements in Syberia, some abandoned cities buried in the Gobi desert, drowned regions in the Bahamas, under Paris, in Italy, in underground facilities of today&#39;s India and Pakistan, in multiple chinese mountain ranges and more.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What was the preffered choice of public transit in the other two technology advanced civilisations??</p>

<p>During the first civilization it was a network of devices that bent space in a manner that allowed to travel vast distances in a single step.</p>

<p>During the second civilization it was an automated system of vessels that hovered a few hundred feet above ground and covered a global network of destinies, much like our railway does today but with much greater speed and not limited by bodies of water.</p>

<p>If you travel in time you cannot travel within your own timeline. You have to calibrate to enter a paralell one, if you fail a person will jump into a void, the void will be forced to balance a consciousness and another paralell timeline will be created that mirrors the timeline a person originated from.</p>

<p>If that happens the original and newly created timelines merge which can remove people, places, periods, memories and more.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The flood? Noah? All the animals? True?</p>

<p>To a point. The final remnant of Atlantis was approximately the size of Scotland. It&#39;s rapid submergence caused a tsunami over three thousand feet high as well as a change in golfstorm.</p>

<p>The result was the inundation of the coastlines as deep as a hundred miles inwards, massive floods and torrential rains that lasted for weeks in many regions of the world. The north american and european glaciers provided the required water while melting.</p>

<p>The Bible offers a dramatization of the actuall geological event. </p>

<p>Many people survived using boats and ships but clearly the entire globe was not inundated, there were efforts to herd animals into safer zones such as highlands but no, there was never a wooden ship meant to house a pair of each species.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Can you give a little more info on the Mound Builders
specifically Serpentine Mound in Ohio.</p>

<p>Mound Builders are distant descendants of people who migrated from Cuba and the Bahamas. The original migration ended up in Mexico some 12.200 years ago.</p>

<p>There they erected a civilization that lasted for more than a thousand years. Eventually civil war broke out and the people who would become native americans split.</p>

<p>A larger group, who practised human sacrifice and was less advanced moved to South America where they founded the many realms found today.</p>

<p>A smaller more advanced group moved to North America where they recreated the urban society of Mexico and attempted, without success to rebuild a civilization lost in the flood.</p>

<p>The mounds have several different purposes, the simple ones were used as foundations for dwellings, the serpentine ones told symbolic stories, yet others were used to cover caches of artifacts bhese people brought with them.</p>

<p>Theirs was a sophisticated civilization, they knew and used water wheels, wagons, wheelbarrows and plows, they created large urban centers.</p>

<p>A crop disease wiped them out causing mass starvation some 3.000 years ago after they flourished for some 4.000 years.</p>

<p>It&#39;s not about trusting a government or trusting this experiments.</p>

<p>It&#39;s about the fact that you are making claims, you must have a verfiable claim, like you perform aremote viewing session, and the validity of your claims can be tested by confirmation on site, by showing that you indeed can see something hidden. It must be performed under controlled and agreed upon lab test criteria, and nobody has ever done that.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Circa 10.600 B.C.E or 12.600 years ago. The entire complex was built for a period of approximately 100 years.</p>

<p>It was built by the local people. The area then was similar to United States today in that it was a melting pot of many cultures.</p>

<p>Why? As a gravestone. These people knew their civilization would end and while many projects were to act as time capsules this one was built as a sort of memorial. In its vicinity were and still are records and caches of artifacts.</p>

<p>How? They used a principle of magnetism to effectively levitate the stones, onto ships from the quarry and then onto their place. They also use a chemical substance to soften the stone for ease of cutting.</p>

<p>Both the substance and the devices used were relatively simple appliances.</p>

<p>Compare your approach - claiming you can see the past without showing any valid methodological approach, with <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/8d0e9t/time_travel/dxjfcxe/">my alternative attempt</a>, which claims nothing but addresses the methodological underpinnings that must be in place.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I can answer some of these questions, based on several CIA remote viewing training documents I&#39;ve read. Their advanced set was particularly interesting (they are all freely available at CIA Foia reading room)</p>

<p>1)Does the viewing require either deep trance states or drug-induced states?
No, usually remote viewing starts with clearing your mind so you can be receptive to incoming information</p>

<p>2)What is the viewpoint of a viewer - overhead? on the ground? close? far? Or can a viewer perceive in whatever aspect they choose?
Aspect is not controllable by the beginner, often times it seems to be dictated by the nature of the prompt, e.g. CIA handler hands you a envelop with latitude/longitude as well as a date range inside (you don&#39;t open it) if the session is given in a lat/long format though , often times the viewer will draw a overhead view of the area in question. </p>

<p>3)Can a viewer hear natural sounds and voices, or can a viewer sense the thoughts of individuals being viewed?
From what I&#39;ve seen when you remote view a scene you start with calling forward the large shapes, then gradually call forward details such as sounds, colours, finer shapes, etc. In several remote viewing sessions I seen indications that feelings were transmitted but not so much total thoughts.</p>

<p>The rest of your questions seem to pertain to the group this guy is a part of but ..
How and by whom are viewers trained?
Truthfully , in all the CIA docs, russian psi documents,  Chinese docs to the same effect. They all agree,   this is a innate human ability which we ALL have to varying degrees. Training can enhance it , and there&#39;s hundreds of books and videos on the practice both in ancient texts as well as modern. </p>

<p>And what do you know about Gobekli Tepe? What is it, who built it and what for? Thanks. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I also have this for you: 
Pyramids, Sphinx and the Valley Temples are the above ground elements of an underground complex. It spans more than a hundred square miles of corridors and chambers.</p>

<p>In order to build and maintain the complex electricity was required. Baghdad batteries provided simple electrically powered lights but there exist devices that needed a lot more power, hence the masts and antennae.</p>

<p>If the complex would be fully operational triggering correct mechanisms would result in vast entrances opening within the pyramids that lead directy into the complex.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The entire complex was built for a period of approximately 100 years</p>

<p>How? They used a principle of magnetism to effectively levitate the stones, onto ships from the quarry and then onto their place. They also use a chemical substance to soften the stone for ease of cutting.</p>

<p>Both the substance and the devices used were relatively simple appliances.</p>

<p>Holy Grail is an allegory. Arthur - a centurion drawn from the locals sought a locationwhere Tuath Danann, ancient refugees from a different period stored their artifacts of scientific nature.</p>

<p>He was not born into poverty, his parents were part of a group that&#39;s analogous to our royalty, he would have lived in significant wealth if he chose to spend his youth with his family.</p>

<p>The reasons for Jesus&#39; being special were not his genes. Jesus was married, he had children, he was also in many ways a very special man. which i can try to expand on:</p>

<p>What Jesus accomplished was done by moving himself, not the world around him.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I know you don&#39;t want to spend time and effort trying to convince us of the validity of your project and would rather simply field questions about ancient civilizations for those who believe you already.  I can empathize with this position, as I assume you truly believe in the validity of your means and thus do not feel pressure to prove them.  Totally get it.</p>

<p>BUT, we are in an awakening age, so I do want to put <em>some</em> of the burden of proof on you guys, just because I think it can be easier to prove your validity than you may have though thus far.  For example, you could discuss the contents of ancient &quot;myths/histories&quot; that are yet to be discovered.  You could pick an inland civilization so that its writings are not underwater.  You could use your skills to identify the likeliest locations of these writings and do a gofundme to raise money to hire a non-mainstream archaeologist to excavate.  I am imagining a case where you identify the location and contents next &quot;Emerald Tablets&quot; and in 20 years are validated in hindsight.  It would require patience, but if you truly have these abilities, you surely understand the pettiness of time and the value of patience, no?  So in summary, I would like to see you guys make some predictions not about the future of our species or the planet, but about concretely verifiable things.  We won&#39;t be able to falsify your predictions because the fact that something is not found doesn&#39;t mean that it doesn&#39;t exist, but at least we may be able to positively verify the validity of your means, and thus better able to accept your conclusions at face value.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s how I see it:
1) If you still protest and don&#39;t want to take any steps toward proving the validity of your means on principle, we on this sub have no choice but to be skeptical of your means and thus conclusions, though still taking in the knowledge for it is free and perhaps true.  Doubt does no preclude learning.
2) In an age of great skepticism and doubt, even of things that ring true, belief in your means will rise and fizzle out again--just as it has for hundreds of years--if you refuse to pursue &quot;proof&quot;.  Astral travel through time and space has been known for millenia, and yet it is almost always totally disbelieved by the people in the last several centuries.  You could be an agent of change in this regard.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I found my research through the FOIA archives to have provided ample evidence of proof of this phenomenon. In fact I came across a few analysis where they state that we have proven the phenomenon so far beyond a reasonable doubt, that the only thing to do from here forward is to improve our abilities. CIA remote viewing programs had success, Russia had success, China had success, etc. I agree though. I would love for people practicing remote viewing to turn their attention to more tangible stuff. I can already see the naysayers coming up with excuses for how it was faked though. I guess that&#39;s why alot of people are a little apathetic to non believers these days, your non belief is more due to lack of research and personal attempts at pursuing the art then lack of evidence...</p>
