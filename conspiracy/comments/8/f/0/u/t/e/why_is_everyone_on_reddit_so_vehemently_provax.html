        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I am anti-vax. Certainly not an expert on the issue, but as a conspiracy minded individual I tend to believe that there are some evil intentions behind the push for vaccinations. Some vaccinations are actually made out of human cancer and tumor cells and that has been approved by the FDA. They have even invented forms of mind control vaccinations. </p>

<p>There’s some serious propaganda behind this. First of all often times there is a pro vaccine article or something that pops up in the most popular feed. Scroll through the comments and anti-vaxxers get downvoted into oblivion. People are saying that anti-vax parents should be punished by the law for putting their child at risk. It just seems so weird. Humans have managed to survive millennia without the use of vaccines, why all of a sudden are they soooo necessary? Maybe there are some good things about them. But honestly people act like getting a vaccination is the single greatest determining factor of whether someone is going to be healthy or sick. And if they support throwing anti-vax parents into a jail cell, why don’t they support doing the same to parents that allow their kids to binge on processed and packaged garbage? Why don’t they support doing the same to parents that allow their kids to become obese? Why don’t they support doing the same to parents that allow their kids to play video games all day instead of going and getting some exercise? I mean parents that allow their kids to do stuff like this, they would also be putting their children at risk. But nobody is vehemently supporting the idea that these people should be in a jail cell. </p>

<p>And just the idea of mandatory vaccinations. It just feels so evil. It isn’t natural in any way. </p>

<p>I know I’m probably preaching to the choir here but seriously what are your thoughts on this. I know Reddit is a site that leans heavily to the left, so perhaps this is not a good representation of the population at large. Just weird how vehemently these people support vaccines but you don’t hear a peep from them about chemicals and artificial preservatives that are proven to be unhealthy and harmful towards ones long term health. I don’t know maybe these people like being jacked up on all this synthetic crap. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Problem is that I think there are good and not so good vaccinations. I believe the principle is sound and many vaccinations are engineered to be as safe and effective as possible.</p>

<p>That said, it is quite possible that some vaccinations are dangerous. This could be because of poor quality control (money/profit over-rides safety) and it is always possible that some are tampered with (by the maker or someone else).</p>

<p>I&#39;m in Australia and I am reasonably confident that our vaccines are ok, but that doesn&#39;t mean they are ok everywhere.</p>

<p>I recently heard that there are many more vaccines routinely used in the US than in Australia and I understand that might lead to questions.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Lol when and if they do they will change their tune... probably not a cretin, just not a parent... you stop worrying about the ingredients in medicine when you have kids because you don&#39;t want them to get sick.. that is HELL. I guess there are some parents that are anti vaxxers.. those are the &quot;cretins&quot; lol I don&#39;t like to call people names for being ignorant though...but if that mom or dad gets whooping cough which is very common... they&#39;re going to nearly kill their kids. Maybe adults without kids do not neccessarily NEED to get vaccinated let them be stupid... but people with kids.. i just dont understand why they wouldn&#39;t. It&#39;s just common sense to know that vaccines are constantly evolving and we have better technology and education than we did when people were first vaccinated for polio. People rarely have complications from vaccinations today.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Because people have been brainwashed into safe and effective. They are taught that if you are vaccinated you are basically immune forever and this immunity is as good as you would get if you actually had the disease. That and vaccine side effects are super rare 1 in a million, and if you get one it&#39;s probably just a coincidence anyway. The general public are also sold a very simplistic version about Andrew Wakefield and his study on 10 kids. Ie the fact john walker smith who worked with Andrew Wakefield who was also struck off by the gmc won his high court appeal, is never mentioned. It would get in the way of the narrative anyway.</p>

<p>What amazes me is that there are actually people in a conspiracy subreddit that trust Wakefield. The guy pushed his terrible research to discredit the MMR vaccine and didn&#39;t disclose that he was developing his <em>own</em> MMR vaccine. It is like the most clear and obvious conspiracy, yet there are still people here eat it up.</p>

<p>I&#39;m always amazed by how actual, real conspiracies that get discovered are rejected by some many in this sub. It&#39;s almost like if we can actually reasonably prove it, it can&#39;t possibly be a conspiracy.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Do you even know what the conclusion of his research paper was? It actually had no conclusion other than more research was needed. People think that his paper claimed the mmr vaccine caused autism and that is flat out wrong. He was a specialist in bowl disease, and all the kids he saw had a new and rare type of bowl disease together with autism. And symptoms appeared immediately after the mmr shot. It was actually the press conference he gave where he was asked about it and he said he couldn&#39;t recommend the combined shots until more research was done. At that time you could still get the separate shots. This is when the media ran with the story and the shit hit the fan. Wakefield was never developing an mmr shot. They were developing something that was supposed to enhance an immune response, but was in no way a vaccine. That claim was made by Bryan deer who either didn&#39;t understand it, or didn&#39;t care to understand it.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>

<p>I do understand this. However, the study was poorly conducted and even this conclusion was wildly speculative and thus to suggest that the vaccine should be halted immediately, very publicly, was completely irresponsible, if done accidentally, which it almost certainly was not. Any researcher should have known that any attempt to link the two based on the research, even speculatively, was trash. It was obviously an attempt to discredit the the vaccine . . . and <em>voila</em> magically he has the solution!</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Wakefield was never developing an mmr shot.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Even if we aren&#39;t talking about a 1-to-1 replacement for the MMR, he was still developing a competing product at the time. It&#39;s a huge and obvious conflict of interest <em>that he attempted to hide</em> by not including it in his research.</p>

<p>And right at the end</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Further investigations are needed to examine this syndrome and its possible relation to this vaccine.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Direct quote from the paper. They never attempted to say the vaccine should be halted immediately, again that is just flat out wrong. As for having a product that was supposed to enhance an immune response, claiming that they wanted to destroy the MMR vaccine (there were single shots available at the time), to replace with something that wasn&#39;t even a vaccine is a pretty stupid claim.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>oh so if I make a vaccine where it has a side effect that there is a 90% chance your genitals will rot away, should you be pro that vaccine?</p>

<p>is it not possible that some vaccines are more important than others, and that maybe if people could open their fucking minds there might potentially be ideas worth discussing, instead of just seeing the word &quot;vaccine&quot; and then shutting out all further thought?  because that&#39;s definitely what I see happening, pretty much everywhere.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m somewhere in the middle. Vaccination against something like whooping cough is vital in my opinion. Getting yearly vaccinations for a simple flu is definitely not. And from what I have heard from doctors is very much not necessary and ineffective most of the time.</p>

<p>Also agree that any dissent is oppressed without every coming forth with arguments. It&#39;s always immediate ad hominem attacks. Would be much more fruitful for both parties to actually have a discussion.</p>

<p>The whooping cough vaccine is only given to children who are past the age of it being dangerous to them! They don&#39;t give whooping cough vaccine to babies who are actually in danger of dying from it. </p>

<p>And...they don&#39;t use vitamin c as a tool to deal with the symptoms of pertussis. My kids had it and the high doses of vitamin c I gave them reduced their symptoms incredibly. And my kids got the whooping cough from a recently vaccinated kid, friends of our family by the way and guess what, I don&#39;t hate them for it unlike some pro-vaxxers who equate unvaccinated kids with walking biohazards...another load of shit...its more like the other way around!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Because vaccines work. Yes they have side effects but they do their job. </p>

<p>I&#39;m going to South America later this year so I got my Yellow Fever and Typhoid fever shot. I had an hour long meeting talking about the risks of the drug and some of them are horrible such as brain damage but the cahnces of that are &gt;.01%. I&#39;ll take that risk because I&#39;ve had friends die from Yellow Fever because they didn&#39;t want to get vaccinated.</p>

<p>You notice we don&#39;t really have a polio or measles problem anymore yeah that&#39;s because of vaccines. Yes there is risk and some may get sick from them but if it&#39;s less than &gt;0.01% then it&#39;s worth the risk. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s not a good comparison. A vaccine is just a shortcut. A vaccine artificially stimulates the nervous system to create a semblance of immunity. It&#39;s not making you healthy, it&#39;s a drug effect that wears off.</p>

<p>Much better to get sick naturally, but it takes longer as you must get sick for a week or two sometimes...but you at least stay immune longer term.</p>

<p>Like any natural vs allopathic treatment...its not as &quot;strong&quot; an effect...but the results are much more holistic.</p>

<p>Smallpox was eliminated by cleaning up the filthy and inhumane living conditions that existed at the time and polio was &quot;eliminated&quot; by the stroke of a pen when the medical authorities re-definied what poliomyelitis was...most cases of polio were then classified as acute flaccid paralysis which is NOT polio. </p>

<p>Also, if you are actually interested in the truth surrounding vaccines instead of committing yourself to the faith in medical authorities, look up Sister Kenney (<a href="http://bigthink.com/natalie-shoemaker/contrary-to-conventional-medicine-of-the-time-elizabeth-kenny-believed-a-patient-should-have-an-active-role-in-their-recovery">http://bigthink.com/natalie-shoemaker/contrary-to-conventional-medicine-of-the-time-elizabeth-kenny-believed-a-patient-should-have-an-active-role-in-their-recovery</a>)</p>

<p>Look into the polio vaccine that was given out in India by the devil in disguise Bill Gates foundation...AFP has gone through the roof in the country.</p>

<p>Also tell vaccines totally help from 1953 we had 30k infect in 1961 we had 161 infected. Polio has been wiped out from the Americas since 1994 but if you really think AFM is polio only 149 case per year is acceptable. </p>

Next he will tell me he is from that country, thus he had multiple friends die from it, because no American would have multiple friends die of disease in another country.  Of course, now that I have told you the truth he will claim to be American probably with family over there.

<p>I&#39;ve noticed no one is hitting  me up about the MMRV vaccines probably because the direct evidence that they worked perfectly and price my point. In a single year after introduction cases went down by 75%. Then the stupid antivaccination crowd came in and we saw a spike in 2015. </p>

<p>Vaccines work end of story I&#39;m sorry that few people don&#39;t like them or are confused by liars. I&#39;m not going to sit and argue with people that refuse to accept thousands of research papers and a multitude of doctors from almost every county in the world that can confirm that they do work.

<p>I just didn&#39;t have time to dig anything up on MMR.   </p>

<p>Vaccines do not provide immunity, they are a temporary and likely cause more harm than benefit imo.   Lot of histeria about possible dangers, people die especially new borns from all sorts of shit.   Look at the US numbers for infant mortality it is the highest in the industrialized world.  Yet everyone is up in arms about vaccines and preventing some possible deaths and no one is talking about he massive amounts of deaths that happen every year.</p>

<p>So really anyone can find anything to prop up their own beliefs especially now a days.   </p>

<p>Vaccines definately can cause sever reactions in a certain type of child.  There are thousands of reports from actual parents (<a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccinesafety/ensuringsafety/monitoring/vaers/index.html">https://www.cdc.gov/vaccinesafety/ensuringsafety/monitoring/vaers/index.html</a>).

    <div class="md"><p>And if out of those millions 10% or more because autistic or have other severe learning disabilities due to everyone&#39;s irrational fears about diseases?</p>

<p>Measels and mumps never killed that many people in the first place.   A majority of other nasty diseases like small pox, maiinly was spread by face to face contact or dirty conditions.   Diseases from Europe before that ie the black plague where due to horendous sanitation practices, like throwing their chamber pots onto the streets.</p>

<p>I am not saying either way, but I do know that I have family that had had completely normal babies before their second rounds of vaccines and then bam, the baby is gone, I mean completely mentally fucked.  </p>

<p>I also know a handful of people who have not vaccinated their babies and the nurses and doctors are completely flabbergasted that the children are so intelligent and speaking full sentences before the age of 2.  </p>

<p>Vaccines do not provide immunity, the only way to become immune to something is to actually have your immune system battle the real disease.   You know like evolution intended, and a lot of times the mother passes that immunity to her offspring.   But in our case we are losing our natural immunities and becoming much weaker as a species.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Vaccines don&#39;t cause autisim, the black plague was spread by lice on rats not dirty condition. And if want talk about small pox fine that&#39;s a prime example of the power of vaccines. Small pox was eradicate from the world in 1980. Of course vaccines don&#39;t provide immunity but provide our bodies with antibodies that understand the virus and know how defend against it. </p>

<p>I get your argument that it&#39;s causing us to be weaker immunity wise but that&#39;s still a risk I think most are willing to take.</p>

<p>It&#39;s very obvious were going to be arguing in circles and even though I appreciate what you&#39;re trying to say I don&#39;t think we&#39;re going to agree. So you do you and I&#39;ll do me.

    <div class="md"><p>Naw, man, I hear you.  I am not saying that there isn&#39;t a use for them in large groups of any mammals.  I raise sheep and we sometimes give the flocks a dose of vaccines.  It pains me to see 5-10% loss in the herd due to something like overeating disease.  </p>

<p>Which I would translate to large amounts of humans in less than natural conditions.  Because the way we raise animals is not natural and therefore we are now fighting natural diseases due to the concentration of the animals.  People are no different. </p>

<p>Now if you can save 5-10% of your group by administering rounds of vaccines then that&#39;s probably a no brainier.   But what if the vaccines cause damage in 5-10% of the population, with animals probably not a big deal because you eat them but what if it is causing learning disabilities due to what else is in the vaccines. </p>

<p>What I am attempting to convey here is we are approaching that point 2.5% of children in the US are autistic that&#39;s up from 1.5 in 2010.  At some point we are going to have to weight the pro&#39;s and con&#39;s of each vaccine.   My approach would be to use way less.  I mean they give newborns 5 doses of the MMR!!    Now to me this doesn&#39;t compute, if a vaccine gives even temporary immunity why do you need an additional dose?</p>

<p>Hey I respect your opinions and appreciate the tone of your response.  I am trying to wade through the muck and get to the real meat of this debate. </p>

<p>Take care</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Its the avalanche of idiots who have been brainwashed to trust a production process which totally lacks a proper quality control process. If you want to provide an analogy that they might comprehend, you will need to make them understand that our vaccine production capability is currently at the horrible &quot;meat industry&quot; level of &quot;The Jungle&quot; as written by Upton Sinclair.</p>

<p>The &quot;pro-vaxxers&quot; are so completely ignorant and in the dark ages that they totally fail to realize that the modern vaccine industry is still in its infancy and quite dangerous. Just like the &#39;meat industry&#39; from Sinclair&#39;s Jungle.</p>

<p>TL;DR: pro-vaxxers are naive and ignorant of the realities of vaccine production.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Alright, ill try cause i find this shit interesting and i work in the healthcare field. First, literally the huge majority of people who prescribe vaccinations are the first to give them to their families. One or 20 paediatricians who come out against it doesnt make the hundreds of thousands (who have every reason to study it) wrong. These people (in universal healthcare countries) are also generally genuinely dedicated to peoples health. There is literally no dr ive worked with who is malicious towards pts, and they understand healthcare far more than you will ever hope to imagine. This is all anecdotal and its pretty vague, but my final point is to what do people believe the reason vacs are bad? There is no reason to give an exploitable class autism, there is vested interest in keeping them useful enough to be parts of the workforce. I just dont understand what people believe the reason is for poisoning people? When it doesnt kill them, doesnt incapacitate them? Im always happy to learn ideas, but seemingly all ive heard is vacs are bad, but no reason as to why theyre used?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Lots of people are allergic to peanuts. Are grocery stores that sell peanuts trying to poison them? The problem is those who promote vaccines promote them as being universally applicable when there is in fact a % of the population that can have adverse reactions to them. </p>

<p>Unfortunately, you can&#39;t test for a bad reaction to a vaccine by swabbing some peanuts on a part of skin. The problem is doctors do not want to admit the extent of human ignorance when it comes to fully testing how different people&#39;s bodies react to different substances.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, there are various levels of being &quot;fine&quot;</p>

<p>Consider someone with a bacterial infection that is then administered anti-biotics. These anti-biotics are not &quot;guided missiles&quot; that only take out the weapons factory and troops. To administer anti-biotics to a patient is to &quot;fire bomb the entire city&quot; and billions of good innocent civilizations (good microbes) get wiped out too.</p>

<p>When you turn on your immune system, your body&#39;s defense system goes on the attack and it also starts drawing on reserve resources to power that attack. Think of a woman who becomes deficient in an important vitamin or mineral after pregnancy. The body is forced to draw on those resources and the patient may not realize he&#39;s ended up with a selenium or iodine deficiency. This is just a small example, also, your body could attack the wrong thing. When you &#39;turn on&#39; the immune system a &quot;war&quot; starts in your body and &quot;collateral damage&quot; can result. </p>

<p>The problem is people want to administer a &quot;one size fits all&quot; vaccine. Even if only .01% of the population has a bad reaction, that is .01% too many and we should strive for better.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yea, you dont need to tell me about the immune system. I get it. Im just yet to see the negative effects of vacs that make it a conspiracy, when 1. Theres so little evidence for it being harmful (based on how many are given. And 2. Theres seemingly no logic as to why any government would poison all their children.

    <div class="md"><p>Well, there are many cases where vaccine producers took the &quot;cheap route&quot; with the fillers in their cocktails and knowingly provided patients with shitty vaccines. There have actually been court cases, and vaccines companies have had to pay out several billions of dollars in damages. I believe there is a &quot;Vaccine Injury Court&quot; that has been set up and many of the &quot;conspiracies&quot; are typically &quot;cover ups&quot; by vaccine producers to escape accountability for their &quot;cheap mass manufactured&quot; vaccines. People who don&#39;t want to pay the price for taking &quot;short cuts&quot; in vaccine manufacturing.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I get that. But throwing words around like billions of dollars means very little when it comes to medical malpractice. Id ask, what proof there is against the hundreds of millions, probable billions of vaccines that have been provided is there of a conspiracy that makes them  bad? When the massively overwhelming community has had no clear adverse reaction, whilst there is quite an obvious correlation between their use and a decrease in certain diseases</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, many of those correlations are also accompanied by the advent of food irradiation technology, water purification, and the availability of more nutritious foods. So, to claim that this decrease is due solely to the availability of vaccines dismisses the very real contributions of these other factors. </p>

<p>It sounds to me like people in the medical profession still want their &quot;one size fits all&quot; solution because they don&#39;t want the hassle of custom tailoring solutions for their patients. I don&#39;t know if that&#39;s a conspiracy, but its definitely bad customer service.</p>
