        <p><span class="badge badge-primary">4</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;2018-04-14 by <a class="author" href="../../../../../../../../user/amgoingtohell.html">amgoingtohell</a></p>
        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Do you think attacking Syria and hampering the Syrian government&#39;s fight against Isis and other jihadi fucks will create more or less refugees?</p>

<p>I ask because people from T_D and Trump supporters in general are outspoken against immigrants and poke fun at European countries for accepting Syrian refugees into their countries.</p>

<p>The US is on Saudi Arabia&#39;s side just like in Yemen. Saudi Arabia finances Isis. It is Isis that had used chemical weapons in the region 52 times since 2016 not the Syrian government.</p>

<p><a href="https://mobile.nytimes.com/2016/11/21/world/middleeast/isis-chemical-weapons-syria-iraq-mosul.html">https://mobile.nytimes.com/2016/11/21/world/middleeast/isis-chemical-weapons-syria-iraq-mosul.html</a></p>

<p>The journalist, famous for exposing the My Lai massacre, Seymour Hersh exposed how chemicals came from Turkey and Saudi Arabia (Britain&#39;s MI6 and CIA involved of course) im this excellent article..</p>

<p><a href="https://www.lrb.co.uk/v36/n08/seymour-m-hersh/the-red-line-and-the-rat-line">https://www.lrb.co.uk/v36/n08/seymour-m-hersh/the-red-line-and-the-rat-line</a></p>

<p>Remember Obama&#39;s red line when he threatened to attack Syria over a chemical attack until the UN&#39;s Del Ponte said it was actually the &#39;rebels&#39;</p>

<p><a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-22424188">http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-22424188</a></p>

<p>And in doing so ruined the bullsuit pretext. No condemnation of the rebels then or threats let alone missile strikes.</p>

<p>The US has also &#39;paused&#39; its assistance to the Kurds fighting Isis to placate Turkey. With this in mind do you think this helps or hinders Isis? </p>

<p>The Syrian people who have flooded into Europe havent done so because they are suddenly fleeing Assad - they have been fleeing Isis and the other Western-backed jihadists. The US, UK and France is merely acting as Isis&#39;s airforce.</p>

I was a rabid KEK worshiping Trump train riding zealot just over a year ago.  He&#39;s a Jesuit pawn and the gatekeepers did a good job with me.

<p>But I also cannot stand the bullshit on T_D, the xenophobic and anti-muslim posts. It is vile but I also recognise that there are/were some good people there. It used to be a much broader church with more libertarian leanings and in the early days allowed much more freedom of discussion than other groups. Unfortunately it lost its way.</p>

<p>Trump&#39;s definitely under a lot of pressure, from his cabinet, politicians from both sides, and a war cheer leading mainstream media (FOX,CNN,NBC). I&#39;m not a fan of Trump or anything but Syria was one of the issues he had a good stance on, even back in 2013 he knew the best course of action was to let Assad and Russia deal with the extremists on their own and get the US the fuck out of there.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Trump had cut almost all CIA funding back in 2017, but two gas attacks blamed on Assad and the constant Russiagate bullshit has changed his tune. His ties to Israel have also pushed him back towards taking action in Syria and become cozy with the Saudis.</p>

<p>Who is they? You do realise that all Syrian refugees arent Muslim? Many are Christian. Sevondly there are many sects of Islam. The most extreme being the fucking wahhabist nutjobs - of the Saudi Arabia and Isis-kind. You know Saudi and Isis that the US is backing and these people are fleeing. </p>

<p>Well done. What percentage of the population do people like this represent? This is like showing people videos of the Westboro Bsptist Church loons and claiming they represent the average Christian in the US. </p>

<p>So, what type of Islam do the idiots in that video follow anyway? </p>

<p>Looking now it&#39;s hard to find this information, the articles now all claim it&#39;s women and children, but if you go back to 2015, before they realized how bad the optics were, the UNHCR <a href="https://refugeeresettlementwatch.wordpress.com/2015/09/07/unhcr-data-confirms-it-75-of-the-so-called-refugees-arriving-in-europe-are-men/">reported</a> 75% of the &quot;refugees&quot; were men, and only 51% are Syrian.</p>

<p>Look up &quot;Hijrah&quot;: According to the all-encompassing religio-political system known as Islam, a “Hijrah” is immigration with the intention of converting the population of the new country to that belief. <a href="http://www.limitstogrowth.org/articles/2015/12/21/hijrah-to-europe-a-syrian-explains-his-purpose-for-relocating-to-germany/">http://www.limitstogrowth.org/articles/2015/12/21/hijrah-to-europe-a-syrian-explains-his-purpose-for-relocating-to-germany/</a></p>

<blockquote>

<p>Your information is outdated, MBS is reforming Islam in Saudi Arabia. Either way, regardless of <em>what type</em> of Muslim these people are, them bringing it into Europe, along with their backwards beliefs and 3rd world reproduction rates, is a threat to every current European; only someone deeply in denial or brainwashed could fail to see that, Islam has been at war with us for 1300 years, they didn&#39;t just stop because the West became &quot;progressive&quot;, they correctly see that as weakness and they <em>will</em> exploit it.</p>

<p>They want islam to rule over the country that they&#39;ve immigrated to</p>

<p>Who is they? You do realise that all Syrian refugees arent Muslim? Many are Christian. Sevondly there are many sects of Islam. The most extreme being the fucking wahhabist nutjobs - of the Saudi Arabia and Isis-kind. You know Saudi and Isis that the US is backing and these people are fleeing. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Here&#39;s proof.</p>

<p>Well done. What percentage of the population do people like this represent? This is like showing people videos of the Westboro Bsptist Church loons and claiming they represent the average Christian in the US. </p>

<p>So, what type of Islam do the idiots in that video follow anyway? </p>

<p>The type promoted by Saudi Arabia in madrassas across tbe globe that encourages terrorism? Trump&#39;s buddies Saudi. Educate yourself.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s proof...</p>

<p>TPTB are clearly pushing for a hot full on war with Syria and then Iran. Trump knows this, and is trying to separate the wheat from the chaff. </p>

<p>Enter, Bolton. He was most likely a major influence in the current happenings (a known neocon puppet of TPTB). Trump wants to gauge enemy from foe, and to see just how bat shit insane these people truly are. </p>

<p>He makes a deal with Russia (and Syria), to selectively hit Syria. Russia moves it&#39;s assets out, so no way for Russia to be personally affected by it. Russia says strong words. </p>

<p>Now, the ball is in the court of puppets on how to respond to the Russian response. If they go full bat shit insane, then he&#39;ll know. From Bolton, all the way to the higher ups in the Intelligence Community and Military. </p>

<p>I&#39;ve read this numerous times on this site.  Can you give some examples of this because I&#39;m starting to believe that Russia just wants certain countries to respect other countries&#39; sovereignty?</p>

<p>Unlike us, Russia knows what it&#39;s like to have a serious war on its homeland so I believe they&#39;re a bit more reserved in invading others.</p>

<p>Do you think attacking Syria and hampering the Syrian government&#39;s fight against Isis and other jihadi fucks will create more or less refugees?</p>

<p>It will have no effect.  It was a targeted strike against chemical weapons infrastructure.  If you don&#39;t remember, we went through this same shit last year.  All the same &quot;OMG fucking Drumpf is going to invade Syria&quot; concern trolling.  It didn&#39;t happen then and it won&#39;t happen now.</p>

<p>That&#39;s not really what happened there.  Obama wanted to do Assad like he did Gaddafi.  Bomb the shit out of his military and let the rebels (who totally aren&#39;t ISIS) murder him and take over the country.  But SoS John Kerry fucked up and told Russia they wouldn&#39;t attack if Assad gave up his chemical weapons, and Russia agreed to it and cockblocked Obama.</p>

<p>That is just your opinion.  </p>

<p>It is Isis that had used chemical weapons in the region 52 times since 2016 not the Syrian government.  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>But what about the Syrian gov being responsible for 85 confirmed chemical weapon attacks since 2013?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The information, based on data from seven sources, shows that the <a href="https://imgur.com/a/dN4Eh">Syrian government is responsible for the majority of 85 confirmed chemical weapon attacks.</a> The data also show that the Syrian government has been largely undeterred by the efforts of the United Nations Security Council, the international Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW), and unilateral action by individual countries to enforce the prohibition on Syria’s use of chemical weapons. <a href="https://www.hrw.org/news/2018/04/04/syria-year-chemical-weapons-attacks-persist">source</a>  </p>

<p>The US, UK and France is merely acting as Isis&#39;s airforce.  </p>

<p>That&#39;s just your opinion. And if they were why did they wait until the majority of ISIS controlled land was reclaimed?</p>
