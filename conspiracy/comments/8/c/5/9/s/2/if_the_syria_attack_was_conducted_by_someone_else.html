    <div class="md"><p>The Greater Israeli Project was and still remains the goal of the Zionists.</p>

<p>If it were not for Obama stepping back and letting Russia and China be in charge instead, the Zionists would have already achieved their goals, even Trump has admitted this. </p>

<p>Syria has been the red line between the Zionists (US, Israel, etc) and the Anti-Zionists (BRICS, North Korea, etc). </p>

<p>Because America could not get into Syria without a conflict of some sort, chemical gas allegations have been thrown at Assad to make it seem like America should handle the situation. This has not worked because an alliance of all of America&#39;s enemies has grown so strong and powerful that it is not as easy as it could have been like back in 2008. The problem heavily relies in the fact that now they have to use such low standard tactics to get their foots in the door I.E. desperate.</p>

<p>The Anti-Zionists know this, thus they have attempted to remain bold in diplomacy as possible. This way, when the Zionists do strike, they can be labeled the enemy of the world. Which is why countries like Iran have followed policies like the nuke deal to very last period on the contract. As long as they follow the rules, it makes the Zionists look like the bad guys to anyone watching. </p>

<p>With on going racial tensions already happening in America, it&#39;s clear that the next move will be to instate order via Martial law. There are just to many thinking heads going on and too many platforms to communicate free thought and free speech.  </p>

<p>You see, America had the chance to be healed and we threw it all away. Obama had us set up to be not only the world leader but a leader by applause and not force. Sadly, as soon as the Zionists got back into office, everything they did was opposite of what Obama did. Infact, Trump was quoted telling different government agencies do the opposite of the Obama administration. </p>

<p>As you can see, he&#39;s messing up our economy via actions like pissing off Canada and Mexico on NAFTA, he dropped out the TPP in which America would have led the entire thing but now will be placed at the bottom of the list with no option of renegotiation. He&#39;s sanctioned our biggest economic competition which holds a large portion of our economy in their own hands. China has recently also started their own petro dollar that countries like Pakistan have joined onto essentially making an even larger group of nations form against us. </p>

<p>Even with all this, they won&#39;t accept defeat.</p>

<p>There is a mad man in the white house.</p>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/982969547283161090?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&amp;amp;ref_url=http%3A%2F%2Fthehill.com%2Fhomenews%2Fadministration%2F382145-trump-puts-blame-on-obama-after-alleged-chemical-attack-in-syria">President Trump Blaming Obama for not crossing the Red Line</a></p>

<p>It seems to be that someone who thought they could control Obama told him to do a strike on Syria much like they did with Trump, to dodge this, he simply followed diplomacy and asked congress in which he was denied (duh). </p>

<p><a href="https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/republicans-strike-syria-trump_us_58e6f71de4b051b9a9da355d">Majority Of Republicans Said ‘No’ When Obama Wanted To Launch A Strike On Syria</a></p>

<p>Then Obama got even smarter and realized that he didn&#39;t want to be the president that started world war 3 and even went on to publicly throw out the word &#39;quagmire&#39;. Which would be the ultimate reason how Russia was able to &#39;swoop&#39; in and gain control of Syria. From that point on, it was none of the United States business. The average person couldn&#39;t understand this but those watching surely understood that this meant that Obama didn&#39;t want the Zionists to get their way. He didn&#39;t do anything wrong either, he saved American lives and further boosted our reputation because of it. </p>

<p>You see, if it were not for Obama stepping in and giving Syria to Russia, the Zionists would already have it. It was this move alone that brought the world time but now that time is just about up. </p>

<p>This is because Obama is an Anti-Zionist, which also why he also gave Iran a nuke deal. It&#39;s clear that he&#39;s down for minorities which is the opposite of European Political Zionists (the largest form of white supremacy). This is why I mentioned that martial law will be coming here soon for Blacks, Latinos, Native Americans and even Whites (and others) who agree with such liberal ideas via Rex 84 and Agenda 21.</p>

<p>Obama went down in the eyes of most Republicans as a &#39;beta&#39; for his actions but again people actually watching saw that it was the best choice to checkmate the Zionists. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Jewish and Zionists are two different things. </p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9qVuvvDCI0">There are white Jewish people and then there are black Jews (Jews of antiquity).</a></p>

<p>You see, understanding the world from a Biblical perspective there were two nations born from the same womb. One was called Jacob and one was called Esau. They never talk about Esau for a reason. </p>

<p><strong>2 Esdras 6:9</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>“For Esau is the end of the world, and Jacob is the beginning of it that followeth.” </p>
</blockquote>

<p>The offspring of these two brothers have been at war since the start. </p>

<p>Now, to understand European Political Zionism you have to understand that it was created by Rothschild. This same family was the main financier behind the transatlantic slave trade. This is the same family that created the false state of Israel. </p>

<p>Thus is becomes clear that these Europeans shipped in planes to an otherwise brown skin area are nothing more than colonizers. Just as Europeans came to the Americas to murder brown people, the same is done in Israel today. </p>

<p>You trying to lump them together is simply because you have to retort.</p>

<p>As for Libya, Obama didn&#39;t order that. It was clear that a devil known as Hillary made that happen. Anything to make put a &#39;chink&#39; in his armor was the goal. They needed something to tarnish his reputation. But he got them back in the end by giving Syria to Russia. This was also apart of prophecy for those who understand where Obama fits in. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>No man can be good but men can do good deeds. </p>

<p>The problem with the judgement against Obama is that it was perfectly aligned with the rise of conspiracy. </p>

<p>In other words, as a black man was being elected, what we now call alternative news was being mainstreamed and other events like the economic recession were happening. This was no mistake, they had to find a way to demonize the person that wasn&#39;t supposed to be there. This is where we see the secret societies collide for the first time out in open. The &#39;house slaves&#39; had essentially took over.</p>

<p>It was racism that fueled majority of white Americans against Obama. Most of the garbage spewed isn&#39;t even factual, go ahead google it. People like Alex Jones and Mark Dice came out of nowhere placing the blame of centuries of devil worship on one man. Suddenly, anyone with liberal views was the devil no matter their skin color and everyone singing country music praising the beast system that was and is America was the &#39;hero&#39;. </p>

<p>Logically it makes no sense.</p>

If you want to sit there and deny that and claim Obama wasn&#39;t a piece of shit, then good day. Dude bought two multi million dollar houses as soon as his presidency was over.

<p>A king can&#39;t have a castle? Are basketball players also evil and wicked? Perhaps your favorite bands? All because they brought mansions, those damn mansions am I right? </p>

<p>What exactly do you hate about Obama? Other than his material possessions if what I am trying to debate. We&#39;ve already established that men cannot be good but can men can do good deeds. What I saw Obama do for the American people was something no president did before him.</p>

<p>So what exactly are you mad at? Ill give some positive notes and you give me the bad ones.</p>

<p>Free healthcare to the poor and middle class? Something Trump wants to get rid of to fund his wars.</p>

<p>Getting rid of dirty energy to replace it with clean energy? Again something Trump has moved against.</p>

<p>Creating policies like the Dodd-Frank act where the little guy gets protected from the rich and almighty? Something Trump is also against.</p>

<p>Exposing racism in America? </p>

<p>Gave a good archetype for young minorities to aspire to be like? </p>

<p>Gave Iran a nuke deal? </p>

<p>Pulling troops out of the middle east?</p>

<p>Giving Syria to the kings of the east to prevent war?</p>

<p>Promoting the idea of helping veterans to the point he cut veteran homelessness in half? </p>

<p>I mean what more do you want from a king? All I am saying is if Obama was white, he would have been blasted between the eyes just like JFK. The only problem is America would have been in flames already.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Basketball players and musicians actually make millions and millions of dollars. Obama did not. How in the fuck did he afford multi million dollar mansions lmao. By doing horrible things and being in the pockets of bankers that&#39;s how. OBAMA WENT TO WAR AS WELL YOU FUCKING IDIOT. Like are you seriously trying to sit here and tell me Obama didn&#39;t drone strike the living fuck out of numerous counties and kill thousands of innocent people. Well he did. If that&#39;s your king then okay buddy. You are a fucking idiot. Are you saying giving Iran a nuke deal was good?? He exposed racism in the USA yet somehow it got worse and he did nothing about it at all. Good job Obama. Get your head out of your ass, just because he didn&#39;t empower zionists doesn&#39;t make him any better than trump. He bombed and destabilized counties, that&#39;s what makes him the same as every president, not because he didn&#39;t side with Jews, oh wait zionists im sorry or for whatever you are saying. He murdered thousands of people who did nothing to him, but yes if that&#39;s your king and your amazing president then okay dude. Stay living in la la land. Also you thinking the health care is good is entirely up to opinion. It was good and bad imo. Obamacare was a failure for the middle class (which I am) poor people got health care and the middle class got financially raped. Amazing health care yes, best president ever, he never destabilized counties, he was never in the pockets of bankers. This is your king hahaha. A war mongering money grubbing whore. Take a hard look at yourself in the mirror. The dude cut food stamps by 8 billion dollars and before he did that he blamed Wall Street for the financial crisis. He then goes on to do 500k speeches for Wall Street lmao. Can&#39;t make this up. What a great man though. You call him a king lol. Unreal.

<p>These countries were openly held hostage by the Israeli Secret Intelligence Service (ISIS) were they not? To prove his diplomacy skills he even gathered nations to take in Syrian refugees so that they could be moved out of the way of the wars did he not?</p>

<p>For Yemen, how do you back up the enemies of the people who hold your petro dollar in their hands? We have to be realistic here if we&#39;re going to talk war. <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2016/10/08/middleeast/yemen-airstrikes/index.html">US: No &#39;blank check&#39; for Saudi Arabia in Yemen</a></p>

<p>Lets be real.</p>

<p>Again, majority of the middle east was already desecrated from the Bush administration. There was no way to pull out without letting the Zionists have the left overs. But what we see now is that Russia and China are directly pushing to help these same countries stand on their own. Did not Iraq do a large portion of the work to fight ISIS? Who trained them? Was it not the US military under the Obama administration?</p>

<p>Again, we&#39;ve gone from a very humble handed president to a tyrant who has made every move to undue the works of his predecessor. </p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>You didn&#39;t touch on the fact that he was in the pockets of banks,</p>
</blockquote>

<p>He did have some bankers on his team for the sole purpose of having people who knew how the system worked. His policies reflected that of robin hood. Again, name another president that setup institutions for the little guy to strike the big banks economically.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>that Obamacare destroyed the middle class,</p>
</blockquote>

<p>How did Obamacare destroy the middle class? Are you sure it wasn&#39;t rich racist whites pulling equity out of the stock market that might have something to do with this? Hmm? The middle class benefited the most from the increase of social services. Which is why Trump wants to get rid of it. Again, this is the largest part of the economy locked into helping heal Americans rather than being used on war. This is why Trump will eventually do away with it. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>that racial tensions somehow rose when he got elected office</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Racial tension rose? Or were they simply exposed? Your idea is that Obama somehow made racism happen is laughable. Tell me, how many racist moments did Obama himself receive as a black president?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>that he bombed 7 counties within 8 years.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Countries that America had already raped to hell and back? Name an actual conflict that Obama himself started that wasn&#39;t placed directly in his lap while those who were directly responsible laughed and said <em>fix it</em>.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>He continued to sell weapons to saudis that destroyed Yemen. Great man. Wish I was more like him.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What should he have done? Removed the Zionist Saudi alliance that a large part of our economy is based on? Cause an even great conflict? </p>

<p>Hmm, perhaps tell me what you would have done.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Your opinion was irrelevant as soon as you said Obama never bombed Syria. When he 10000000% did. This is the last thing I&#39;ll comment to you because arguing with a person who believes obama was a king will get neither of us nowhere. You stay in that little bubble of yours and continue to think what you want, good day and good riddance </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The president of united states is a king.</p>

<p>Every president of the United States is essentially a king... are they not?</p>

<p>It will get you to understand that there was a difference. </p>

<p>For the sake of doing less talking and presenting more facts:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The Obama &quot;red line&quot; and the chemical deal Syria was long known to have large chemical weapons stockpiles. In 2012, President Barack Obama said the use of chemical weapons by the Syrian regime would not be tolerated. <strong>He said it would be &quot;a red line for us.&quot;</strong> In August 2013, a chemical attack in the eastern Ghouta suburb of Damascus killed more than 1,500 people, including hundreds of children. Horrific images circulated. <strong>Obama gave a speech saying the U.S. should act against Syria. But he said Congress should authorize any military action. Over the next month, it appeared there was little support in Congress or among the U.S. public for military intervention. The U.S. endorsed a Russian-backed plan to remove chemical stocks from Syria.</strong> (Where Russia was given Syria) More than 1,300 tons of chemical agents were removed. Chlorine was not part of the deal, since it is commonly used for water treatment and other industrial purposes. Last weekend, pro-opposition rescue workers in the Damascus suburb of Douma — in the eastern Ghouta district — said 43 people were killed in what they described as a chemical attack. The figure for the dead and the exact weapons used — and whether they were chemical weapons — have not been independently verified, though local medical workers say the symptoms indicate a chemical attack. Many of those killed, activists say, were in the basement of a house, which could be where an intense concentration of the chemical settled.</p>

<p>But alas it doesn&#39;t matter, I was simply talking about the story of both sides, it was you that singled out Obama.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t like obama, I don&#39;t like trump. People who bomb other counties for no reason other than personal gain should never be liked. This has been the case with every president in my lifetime. I give them all a chance and then they eventually blow that chance by showing they don&#39;t care for humanity. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This I understand but again, Obama didn&#39;t want any of these countries. He was given a position of power that had already obtained them. As such, the best moves are sometimes not always the ones that are viewed as the right ones. </p>

<p>He could have pulled every single troop out of the middleast but we both know what would have happened. So why try to make it seem like he had the choice to just do as he pleased? The mainstream media was already calling him a <em>secret Muslim</em> before he was even sworn in. Now how would it look if he had just pulled out all the troops from the middle east and something terrible happend?</p>

<p>Again, I don&#39;t think any world leader alive experienced the shaky bridge of leadership that Obama did. Every single move had to calculated and even then, something still could go wrong. Racism played a LARGE part of why Obama was unable to accomplish so much of the policies he wanted to. The demonetization of a humble man is the worst kind. Now we have this prideful mad man in the white house who literally shits on gold toilets and can do all the things he wants to without anyone to stop him. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Also I never lumped anyone in together you just went on an entire tangent for no reason at all because I said &quot;Obama didn&#39;t side with the Jews&quot; ok Obama didn&#39;t side with the &quot;Zionists&quot; better? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well because groups like American Jews (White Jew<strong>Ish</strong>) don&#39;t side with Zionism either. </p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKplabTRuak&amp;amp;t=13s">Rebel Rabbis: Anti-Zionist Jews Against Israel</a></p>

<p>To ignore such foot notes is to generalize. It ignores the most important concept which is Zionism is literally nothing more than white supremacy. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>So we are just okay with obama being in the pockets of bankers because &quot;they knew the system&quot; okay then haha. Obamacare raped the middle class financially. Clearly didn&#39;t destroy it. It wasn&#39;t some sort of secret that racism was still a thing, but what did obama once do to improve it? ! Nothing at all. Yes it did get worse, you didn&#39;t start to hear of cops killing black people so frequently until he came into office. Yes the Countries were already messed up so let&#39;s just keep on messing them up! lol that&#39;s a very silly way to think. And no Libya was actually thriving. Ghaddafi was indeed a dictator but surly was a good one, put all that oil money into the country and helping his citizens. Education and health care was free, he made the largest irrigation system the world has ever seen so his people had clean water. It was free to start a farming business. Google pictures of Libya now after obama went in. You know why he went in? Well Libya had their own banks. Obama and buddies didn&#39;t like that now did they? So what you said is untrue, Libya was doing just fine before Barry invaded. </p>
