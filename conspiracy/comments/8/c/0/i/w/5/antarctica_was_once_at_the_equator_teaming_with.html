Essentially every world power has or had some sort of presence there, Russia, the US, Nazi Germany, even through their many conflicts with eachother over the decades, Antarctica has never been a continent to ever have a battle in documented history despite it being rich in resources that are supposedly sought after elsewhere. The Rockefellers and Rothschilds funded many of the first expeditions to Antarctica and continue to have a presence there. Are they suddenly interested in preserving the environment in Antarctica when otherwise elsewhere they couldn&#39;t give two fucks?</p>

Oil is just organic material placed through a process of pressure and time. They&#39;ve already discovered a wealth of oil but there is an agreement to not drill for oil. There is a bit of exploratory drilling going on.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Antartica Treaty. Prevents military presence or resource extraction. Ratified by all the big players. Plus it&#39;s freakin cold and unprofitable to extract resources. It&#39;s oil reserves are unproven and estimates vary widely.</p>

<p>Sometimes good things happen like the Antartica Treaty. It&#39;s also good for another 3 decades and ratified by Congress so a President can&#39;t just ignore it and start drilling without a 2/3 majority in both Congress.</p>

<p>Plus do you really want to go disturbing UFOs and alien bases?</p>
