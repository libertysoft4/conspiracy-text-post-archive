But I&#39;ve never seen anything like this happen on <a href="/r/askreddit">/r/askreddit</a>. When I mean the content was only about conspiracies, I mean it had virtually no political or social implications. It had no cussing, it had no nudity, it had nothing but content on conspiracies. They completely nuked the top comments from orbit.</p>

<p><a href="https://i.imgur.com/LopaUoo.png">Here&#39;s an example</a>. The only reason you can see how many upvotes it had is because I saved it due to how interesting it was. This particular comment was about the Soviet assassination program, but there were other absolutely amazing comments that were removed about the CIA mind-control experiments, Northwoods, MK Ultra, et cetera. I mean the content was amazing, it was all sourced and reasonably skeptical and all of that. </p>

<p>They removed it all! They replaced ALL of the top comments with other stuff. Wtf?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The way I see it, there are 3 possible scenarios here:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Knowing Reddit is under close watch by the government and advertisers already following the 2016 election, the mods are trying to proactively avoid stirring the shit and are purging the most controversial material independently. (IMHO: likely, especially given the commericalist neutrality Reddit keeps pushing towards achieve)</p></li>
<li><p>These comments were planted and exploited to the top by Russian/ RU allied trolls as part of their anti-US propaganda campaign, and the mods suspected or somehow determined this abuse and reacted accordingly. (IMHO: plausible, but hinges on several caveats, namely that the mods were contacted by the admins and the admins had a way to identify this abuse without a way to stop it from happening)</p></li>
<li><p>The US government is not only creating content to steer public opinion, but actively suppressing content to do the same, and have enough pull on the mods to require the removal of content unfavorable to their own propaganda campaign, a violation of the first amendment. (IMHO: entirely possible, not entirely likely. Suppressing information by deleting it strikes me as too blatantly a 1A violation. I&#39;d assume the NSA&#39;s modus operandi is more along the lines of creating and promoting their own content to distract from this information, which is more legally defensible.)</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Regardless of which explanation is most accurate, what we&#39;re seeing here is alarming.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I am looking at it now and did what u/MKULTRAserialkillers suggested.  It is a shitshow of red markup.  Moderators removed a comment with 1,034 likes because the person commented that since they had seen the CIA was involved in many of the conspiracies they wondered what else the CIA was up too.  </p>

<p>I don&#39;t spend much time in ask reddit, but I don&#39;t think it is like Ask Historians with extremely strict posting guidelines.  Just looking at some of the front page, however, it doesn&#39;t seem so.  </p>

<p>There is an NSFW query about What&#39;s the Weirdest thing you&#39;ve seen in porn.  I am all for people doing whatever they want, if porn is ones thing that is fine, but in terms of censorship I think deleting any reference to the CIA in the threafd you mentioned but allowing a response to the porn question along the lines of  &quot; a woman riding a car gear shift while listening to ABBA songs&quot; strikes me as somewhat selective. </p>

<p>I wonder if reddit hired outside &quot;content caretakers&quot; similar to youtube?  This is the third or fourth mention of censorship I have seen in the past five days and it seems like the censored content strikes me as odd. </p>

<p>We know  that what can be accurately described as propaganda is alllowed and used on americans and has been for decades:

    <div class="md"><p>When the media obsesses over one issue it’s usually because they’re deflecting another’s coverage. In this case I believe it’s Syria and all the usual Trump stuff. While I don’t know EXACTLY what it is that could be being covered up, I have some ideas.</p>

<p>Could be that “world currency” thing that’s appeared on this sub several times.</p>

<p>Could actually be events setting the stage for a large military confrontation. A lot of people online are saying “much WWIII”, which, I don’t know, seems like it would need a lot more than Syria to start. </p>

<p>I’d be a little hesitant to dive into any of the popular media topics at the moment, and instead try and get a better idea of the bigger picture. Times like these remind me of the saying “Nothing in politics happens by accident”.</p>

<p>Yep, and you&#39;ll see much, much more unless reddit fixes it. Sadly, it&#39;s not even a conspiracy. What it actually is is that reddit mods are given terrible, limited tools for moderation, and when something is on the front page, the overload is absurd. The only way to even kind of keep up is to carpet bomb everything with deletions.</p>

<p>It&#39;s reddit that is broken, and it&#39;s only getting worse because it&#39;s a scaling issue, unless better mod tools and auto moderation tools for high volume threads are added.</p>

<p>But, <em>and this is critical</em>, reddit needs better transparency and accountability for mods. The anonymity and non-accountability of mod actions is just as crippling as lack of mod tools.</p>
