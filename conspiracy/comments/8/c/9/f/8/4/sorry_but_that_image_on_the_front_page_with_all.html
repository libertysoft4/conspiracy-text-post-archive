<p>Meanwhile, topics like Pizzagate, chemtrails, and posts exposing monsanto barely ever make the front page anymore, especially after the recent changes made to the sub. </p>

<p>Criticism of Israel is fine, but you do realize everybody who visits here is going to roll their eyes and blow us off as a bunch of anti Jewish nut jobs, if they see an influx of anti-Jewish posts day in and day out? Was the star of David on the president&#39;s foreheads <em>really</em> fucking necessary? Even a lot of the comments in that thread are pointing out how stupid that looks. </p>
