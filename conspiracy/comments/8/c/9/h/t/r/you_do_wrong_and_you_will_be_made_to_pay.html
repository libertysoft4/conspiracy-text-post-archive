All those who have done wrong have been and will be immediately made to pay. You plan or even think about taking another innocent life, here or overseas, and you will immediately be judged on not only the plan but the intended outcome. The lord has Me as the one who shall dispense punishment accordingly. And no amount of lifelong spying, DEWing, voodoo attacks, and other satanist tricks of yours will stop it. Because although you actively deny God, your creator, you know that he is just and he is swift. You also know that there exists a way for any person to immediately dispense spiritual justice on anyone who does wrong. Well not only do I know this way, and know it very well, but also have the backing and acceptance of the lord who will insure my victory.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>from all the research i have done, i will be the one to defeat the current satanist rule and return the world back to God thereby opening up a wellspring of good energy and happiness that can and will only propagate when wickedness has been abolished. It&#39;s not how far im willing to go, its my destiny. It will happen. It is happening. All the high up elite know my identity and I see them almost daily living in Los Angeles. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>check my posting history, check about the last year. About 7 months ago discovered my true identity by impulsively (God) googling &quot;1984 kabbalah.&quot; There it was, an article written by some kabbalist about the rumor that the messiah will be born in 1984. It was literally my holy grail. Everything in my life suddenly made sense all the abuse all the miracles, etc. Next day googled again because I wanted to screenshot it, gone. They monitor all my communications, have cameras throughout my home, all my neighbors are CIA/satanists. I believe they enticed my uncle to come live in Los Angeles from Egypt, thereby bringing my father and mother here. Los Angeles is Babylon.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think that, to be the MEssiah, your entire identity (your ‘me’) wouldn’t exist. You’d be driven by godly happenings, without any sense of self reflection, rather than being driven by the ‘me’, or the internal story of who you think you are. This probably sounds crazy haha. You’d be perfection. I think you’ve potentially just tapped into some of the power of manifesting your own reality, in real time, right in front of you, by holding powerful beliefs. Some might suggest you have a mental illness, but I’d bet you’ve just spent a significant amount of time in solitude. Have you? At one point in my own conscious awakening journey, I thought I was going to be some ‘awakened guru’ like Adyashanti currently is. Don’t want to do that anymore. By all means, pursue what your heart tells to, but certainly take a moment to ask yourself if all this is real and if you’ve just sent yourself on a fantastic, exciting, delusional trip by manifesting your own beliefs. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>to be honest if that was the case then I would have chosen not to go down this path. I understand the implications, and the dangers. But then I remember all that they have put me through, and the kids growing up and how they can spot bullshit quicker than us older folks. Shit has to change, war needs to stop. We are so desensitized that we are unable to understand just how serious taking 1 life is. Then you multiply that by the 100,000s or even millions, its insane. And no one wants it! No one in their right mind should or would be okay with taking the life of another human being. No one that is not a satanist. The very essence of satanism is anti-goodness, anti-God. Their whole life purpose is to run plays on the unsuspecting non-satanist. That&#39;s why they rape kids and commit horrendous acts, because to them its a positively fulfilling thing. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree that the collective desensitization is profound and disgusting. But there are a lot of us who are aware of how horrible it is but who also recognize that all we can do is be the best version of ourselves wherever we are. We won’t have the power until we unite, and there seems to be a ‘play’ that is going on right now between many major powers, which needs to figure itself out before any real, authentic <em>good</em> change will happen. I hope I’m wrong and humanity revolts and gets fed up with the bullshit, but we’re too deeply programmed right now. I don’t think you’re the messiah, but I’m not going to say you aren’t, because that isn’t fair. I don’t really know you. All I can say is good luck though, man. Thank you for your positive vibes, regardless of all that. </p>
