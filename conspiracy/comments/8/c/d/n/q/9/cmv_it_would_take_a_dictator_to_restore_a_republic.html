    <div class="md"><p>The roman politician/general Sulla did precisely that actually. After reforming the republic he gave up his dictatorship and retired to the country to write his memoirs.</p>

<p>Of course the reforming meant a great deal of political purging - maybe upwards of 9000 people.</p>

<p>He had a very interesting life but has been overshadowed by caesar in the popular imagination, would recommend reading into it. That stage of the late roman republic is very interesting.</p>

<p>My point is that if an UNcontrolled person got into office and wanted to change things, they wouldn&#39;t able except by force. Too many corrupt people have too much to lose by voluntarily exposing themselves. Not gonna happen. So a civil war would ensue.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That one such dictator would have to have complete control of the military and be willing to go against the banks.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not sure one such person can control the entire military.  I also think the banks could easily kill any President, even one such as influential as an H.W. Bush.</p>

<p>In my mind, absolute rulers are the most efficient government, so I agree it would be difficult to flip national policy on it&#39;s head without an absolute ruler, but I just don&#39;t see any one person escaping the clutches of capitalism in order to sustain a revolution in any major nation.</p>

<p>Look at Venezuela.  With large proven oil reserves, that country should not have any of the difficulties it has now, but sanctions are crippling them.  Capitalism is crushing a ruler attempting to run a nation without them.</p>

<p>As far as mentioning the people at large, if enough of us work together we can overturn any system.</p>

<p>So I guess it&#39;s a matter of what is easier to acheive; getting a dictator with enough power and influence over the military and banks to change a system entirely, or getting a critical mass of the population to work together in order to do so.  Both seem astronomically difficult to accomplish.</p>

<p>Sure, the same Constitution and &quot;founding principles&quot; that got us here in the first place.  Makes sense.  They need to catch up on their Spooner, obviously.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve never really been sure how they plan to make everyone care about the same principles, all of a sudden, all at once.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree with you.   If a governing body is so far gone that it cannot be restored by it&#39;s own immune system of checks and balances,  it would ironically require a dictatorship with good intent to fully restore what was lost before returning the system to the people. </p>

<p>How else would it be done?  &quot;Writing to our Representatives&quot; isn&#39;t going to unravel centuries of nepotism, back scratching,  and elitism that is destroying the foundation from within. </p>

<p>Only drastic and fully unconventional means would serve to rehabilitate such chaos. The dictatorship would have to be,  itself,  guided by higher principles,  like an extremely strict but unconditionally loving parent.  Able to enforce sweeping and draconian measures while,  at the same time,  wielding that force with loving intent bent on reconstruction.  </p>

<p>Sounds God-Like to me.   I&#39;m  not sure if any group of humans, at this point in our evolution,  can collectively possess the power and influence necessary to rip up government foundations while remaining impeccable in their intent of restoration.  </p>

<p>It would take a group of humanity&#39;s  absolute best,  working in total concert,  for it to work without descending into abberrance. These people would have to be fully aware of Universal Law and the Spiritual state of Humans.  Their guidance would be from higher dimensions lest the path be diverted by lower frequencies and basic Human Nature. </p>

<p>People of that necessary purity aren&#39;t going to be found tromping around the political arena. The dictatorship would have to be composed of fully aware Masters channelling their Higher Aspects. </p>

<p>It seems an impossible juxtaposition for me to fathom. </p>

<p>I sure do like the idea of it, though. Our leaders should be Spiritual Masters. Masters,  meaning,  masters of their own Human condition, unswayed by lower wants because they are incorruptibly following higher guidance. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Why did you post on CMV if you just wanted to see someone agree with you. Fuck your idea of dictatorship being a solution. I put my life on the line to defend freedom amd democracy for ten years, I watched people die for that ideal, I saw dozens of planes filled with the flag draped caskets that are still censored by the media. Fuck you, fuck your idea of dictatorship, I reject your acceptance of the concept. No single strongman or authoritatian leader can deliver on that promise. If you want dictatorship, go live in an autocratic state, there&#39;s no shortage of them in the world.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The name &quot;dictator&quot; actually comes from the title of an official of the Roman republic who was appointed for a six month term, and who was authorized to act completely outside the law.</p>

<p>Obviously, as mentioned, this system eventually broke down as the dictators turned into emperors-for-life.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The roman politician/general Sulla did precisely that actually. After reforming the republic he gave up his dictatorship and retired to the country to write his memoirs.</p>

<p>Of course the reforming meant a great deal of political purging - maybe upwards of 9000 people.</p>

<p>He had a very interesting life but has been overshadowed by caesar in the popular imagination, would recommend reading into it. That stage of the late roman republic is very interesting.</p>
