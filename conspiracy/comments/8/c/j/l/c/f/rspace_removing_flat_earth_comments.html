<p>Another trend I&#39;m noticing is I get banned from certain subreddits simply for subscribing or participating to subs like r/conspiracy. Is this what it&#39;s come to...?</p>

<p>And I&#39;m wondering as I get older, were people always like this? I&#39;m not sure they were... But maybe I just wasn&#39;t paying attention. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>In a science based sub, it makes no sense to dilute real content with unscientific BS.</p>

<p>Pretending <strong>all</strong> viewpoints are equal only serves to prop up bullshit at the expense of facts. Allowing legitimate debate is one thing, giving time to idiots and pretending their viewpoint is worthy of consideration is another. There are lots of arguments that do not deserve consideration and that should be dismissed out-of-hand. All you do is legitimize a blatantly false idea.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It also makes no sense to delete comments. If a discussion is happening, then let the discussion happen. Maybe more people on the opposing side will have their questions answered. Besides, the scientific method doesn&#39;t deem some ideas stupid or not worthy of consideration. It&#39;s only biased people who do that. Not very scientific if you ask me. Nobody is asking you to study every theory out there but if someone else wants to start a discussion about a particular theory, why should certain topics be banned?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>for example: &quot;You can not prove to me you are a real person who experiences emotion, and not simply a figment of my imagination&quot;</p>

<p>This statement cannot be proven false, and it&#39;s certainly not worthy of discussion or consideration. It might be fun in a philosophy class, but it has no business in a pseudo-scientific subreddit, and certainly not worthy of consideration in anything outside of sophistic circlejerking.</p>

<p>Not all arguments are worth discussion, some can be dismissed out of hand, and taking time to refute them simply gives them a false air of legitimacy.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not at all, but it does provide a legitimate platform from which to call out all of the fools who insist that unscientifically derived facts are as valid as those which meet the scientific method. </p>

<p>Science isn&#39;t about opinions it is about using facts derived from repeatable experiments that have a large enough scope and sample size to fully encompass a problem or a challenge. </p>

<p>Flat earth theory fails that. As soon as you fly high enough above the earth...boom you see the blue marble. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re not hearing me. My job exists because the US Army needs a tactical network. That tactical network uses both commercial and USG satellites to relay signals around the world. If the earth were flat none of this would be necessary. Why would the government spend billions of dollars to build a less efficient communications network than it already has?</p>

<p>Also, the equipment I use is extremely specialized. It has one purpose and was custom built specifically to fulfill that purpose. At some point, someone on the chain has to know that they are building a lie. Are you saying there&#39;s a secret underground group of thousands of engineers who are solely responsible for making equipment that looks like it does one thing while actually doing another. And they have to be so good at it that other engineers can&#39;t look at their work and see that something doesn&#39;t add up? You do know that is literally impossible, right?</p>

<p>C) If the Earth were flat or space didn&#39;t exist or satellites weren&#39;t real, it would not be able to do what it is supposed to do.</p>

  1) Space is real and satellites are where they are supposed to be
  2) Space is fake, satellites are fake, and someone is making this equipment to be functional but to appear that it is doing something entirely different than what it is actually doing while also somehow disguising this trickery to the point that no expert in the world has ever been able to see through the illusion.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I did. Years ago. I argued for the flat earth in a persuasive speech in high school after picking up a book on the subject because I thought it was good for a laugh.</p>

<p>Then I looked again recently because I noticed it had started gaining popularity again. Exactly the same material. No advancement, still no evidence. Every video I&#39;ve seen on YouTube on the subject contains nothing that wasn&#39;t already being used by flat earthers more than 25 years ago. Their &quot;evidence&quot; can be summed up something like this:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Water always finds its level (without defining what &quot;level&quot; means or providing any evidence to back up this assertion)</p></li>
<li><p>The horizon is always at eye level (without bothering to do the calculations about how much of a drop should be expected at high altitudes or even confirming this observation through experimentation)</p></li>
<li><p>You can sometimes see things that should be obscured by the horizon (without bothering to explain why you can&#39;t ALWAYS see these things, why this only happens over bodies of water on cool days, or why atmospheric refraction isn&#39;t a good enough explanation)</p></li>
<li><p>Pilots don&#39;t see the curvature (again, without bothering to do the calculations regarding exactly how much curvature you should be seeing at 40,000 ft. Hint: it&#39;s not much)</p></li>

<p>It&#39;s honest super tedious and when pressed for better explanations for their crackpot theories the only answers they ever give are &quot;you just have to look into it for yourself&quot; or &quot;just look around you&quot; or some other such nonsense. Honestly, until they can present some sort of coherent argument, flat earthers should be ridiculed and ostracized mercilessly because they are basically a cult</p>

<p>That&#39;s what you got out of that?</p>

<p>What bothers me is that flat earthers are being propped up as though they represent a legitimate position when they don&#39;t. Every time a flat earther gets to speak without being chastised, it empowers them and acts as confirmation bias for any other idiots in the audience. It also enables idiots who believe in this dumb shit to believe in other dumb shit, which is how you end up with things like Donald Trump as your president</p>

    <div class="md"><p>They should remove that shit here too. The vast amount of data and math one would need to get over to refute our known shape of the world is staggering. Well beyond the comprehension of any serious FE proponent. (Most are not serious)</p>

<p>And if you <em>truly</em> believe flat earth you are gullible and misguided. And probably intelligence deprived.</p>

<p>If you believe in flat earth as a method to resist convention and to actually check stuff for yourself then you&#39;re all good to go.</p>

<p>Safest bet is to keep the stuff in your own subs. There are a few that welcome garbage posts. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Many look at the lizard people thing as a metaphor. And without cutting on open we may never know.</p>

<p>However this world has been measured by hand. The little tricks fe&#39;ers do are only successful in the dim witted. 
Seriously. The north south east west runway conundrum? It ain&#39;t that tricky. </p>

<p>Crepuscular rays? It probably would blow some minds to know those are actually parallel. (And ignore anticrepuscular ones!)</p>

<p>The gyroscopes on planes? Weak and ignorant. </p>

<p>I could go on and on but it&#39;s such a boring waste of time. </p>

<p>The time has come for FE to dry up and blow away, like most other shit does.</p>

<p>I wouldnt doubt if Ickes income was waning he would be all over flat earth for a buck. So lizards ain&#39;t your best example. Flat earth is just wrong. Being science it is well certain that it is wrong too. </p>

<p>Wilfully ignorant. One of the worse human traits.</p>
