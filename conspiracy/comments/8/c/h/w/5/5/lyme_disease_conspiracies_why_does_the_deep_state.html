        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Before I get into my research, I just want to disclaim I have a dog in this fight. I have Lyme disease, and I have been researching it extensively trying to find a cure for myself. I’ve even posted on this sub asking for help (<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/89bh7h/how_do_you_recover_from_lyme_disease/">https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/89bh7h/how_do_you_recover_from_lyme_disease/</a>) and did get some responses and ideas that I never would have come across before if I hadn’t. So thank you.</p>

<p>In return for helping me, I would like to share with this community what I’ve discovered on my journey down this rabbit hole. For brevities sake I’m going to link to a lot of outside resources to explain certain things so you can do your own research.</p>

<p>The most prominent Lyme disease conspiracy dates back to Operation Paperclip (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Paperclip">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Paperclip</a>), theres a book called Lab 257 (<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Lab-257-Disturbing-Governments-Laboratory/dp/0060011416">https://www.amazon.com/Lab-257-Disturbing-Governments-Laboratory/dp/0060011416</a>) with a lot more info. This is by far the most “accepted” of conspiracies concerning Lyme, and its origins. To put it simply, Lyme disease is potentially a bioweapon that was engineered by former Nazi scientists at a secret lab run by the FDA who was conducting military research on how to weaken opposing enemies populations without them even realizing what was happening, it later escaped the lab infecting mostly Americans.</p>

<p>However, this is merely the origin story from the 1950’s-1970’s when it escaped the lab. There is a much greater conspiracy which starts in the 1980’s and 1990’s which gets very little attention, and has a much wider impact on people like myself who have potentially been suffering for decades.</p>

<p>There&#39;s a conspiracy that several members of the CDC invested in a vaccine in the 1980&#39;s early 90&#39;s, called Lymerix, but it eventually had to be pulled from the market. Turns out, the vaccine was actually giving people Lyme disease. Of course, several members of the CDC owned intellectual property rights to this vaccine through holding companies in Europe.</p>

<p>The people involved basically had two choices. 1) Resign, acknowledge their conflict of interest, and possibly face criminal charges for deceiving the public and infecting people with a vaccine that actually caused the disease it was supposed to treat, or 2) use their positions within the CDC and government to change the definition and diagnostic criteria for Lyme disease to eliminate the vast majority of cases and derail future research so they couldn’t be held liable.</p>

<p>I’m sure you can guess which option they went with, and thus the latest conspiracy for Lyme disease actually began. For proof and more info please checkout this documentary: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8DU1Z6R-ms">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8DU1Z6R-ms</a> it is low budget, but the information and evidence is shocking.</p>

<p>By changing the definition of the disease they basically eliminated any neurological diagnosis from taking place for nearly the past 30-years, which is estimated by some to be as high as 80&amp;#37; of cases. This also means that 80&amp;#37; of cases are not acknowledged, and thus the actual number of people with Lyme is grossly under reported. The CDC protocol for treating Lyme is known to only be 50&amp;#37; effective, so if you follow the CDC protocol you have a 50&amp;#37; chance of ending up disabled and remaining chronically ill for the rest of your life.</p>

<p>What’s worse is we don’t know if Lymerix actually weaponized Lyme disease further. Vaccines are often mutations or “dead” versions of a bacteria or virus, but Lyme disease is NOT a virus, and is arguably not even a bacteria. It is a spirochete, it is a parasitic micro-organism that is an entirely different species of micro-bacteria with capabilities similar to a virus in that it can go into remission by hiding itself within biofilms protecting itself from the immune system and antibiotics. However, it is a living parasitic organism that feeds off sugars but can also pivot and consume fats and proteins if necessary.</p>

<p>It can also burrow into joints, brain tissue, and organ tissue removing itself directly from the blood stream. This is why it is so hard to treat, and kill. Meanwhile, if you do kill it, it releases neurotoxins further weakening the person or animal it infects allowing the infection to repopulate as the hosts immune system is weakened by the neurotoxins.</p>

<p>There are conflicting research studies that indicate Lyme disease can be spread sexually, via blood transfusion, and even from saliva. Some studies say it can be: <a href="https://www.lymedisease.org/lyme-sexual-transmission-2/">https://www.lymedisease.org/lyme-sexual-transmission-2/</a></p>

<p>Then theres studies that claim it can&#39;t be: <a href="http://www.aldf.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Lyme-Borreliosisis-is-not-Sexually-Transmitted-2.2.17.pdf">http://www.aldf.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Lyme-Borreliosisis-is-not-Sexually-Transmitted-2.2.17.pdf</a></p>

<p>This could potentially explain why Lyme disease is now reaching epidemic proportions in the US and other countries, many of which the patients claim to have never been bitten by ticks.</p>

<p>What this ultimately means is we don’t know if Lyme disease can be spread via other vectors other than ticks but there is a possibility it is contagious. Even if the disease is only being spread by ticks, I’ve read reports where 50-70&amp;#37; of ticks now carry Lyme and tick populations have been exploding around the country due to increasing global temperatures.</p>

<p>There was another post on r/conspiracy from several months ago from a veterinarian that stated they were in a South American country volunteering, and 70&amp;#37; of the stray animals they tested had Lyme disease. The odds of 70&amp;#37; of all animals being bitten by ticks infected with Lyme is just not likely. Meaning the dogs and cats who are spreading the disease are possibly getting it from somewhere else, possibly sex, or even just from licking each other, or another unknown way (maybe they&#39;re eating infected meat?). There was even a post recently on r/dogs about a woman who was attacked by her dog after being diagnosed with Lyme (<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/8bzej9/help_my_dog_attacked_me_viciously_and_i_need/">https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/8bzej9/help_my_dog_attacked_me_viciously_and_i_need/</a>) which of course is now locked.</p>

<p>This disease has gone full blown in animal populations and is very likely in our food supply. Who knows if eating meat from an animal that had Lyme can get you sick or not, but considering this was potentially an FDA research project it is entirely possible this was intended to eradicate a populations food supply or use the food supply to infect the human population. It would also explain why they pump our animals full of antibiotics in the US, which unfortunately could have caused further antibiotic resistance all these years later. There’s even a form of Lyme disease that is causing allergies to red meat, and we have no idea why (<a href="https://www.lymedisease.org/redmeat/">https://www.lymedisease.org/redmeat/</a>).</p>

<p>It is entirely possible that the Lyme that escaped Plum Island vs. the Lyme disease we are treating today has evolved, as intended, and is much more contagious and harder to treat than previously understood. It is also potentially antibiotic resistant.</p>

<p>Lyme disease is actually several different kinds of spirochetes, and different spirochetes have different properties and effects on their hosts. Some go after joints, others go after the brain, and some potentially attack and weaken the immune system itself. We are still identifying all the different forms of Lyme and trying to figure out what they do.</p>

<p>With all of this said, there was some serious fuckery going on in the 1980’s and 1990’s when it comes to Lyme disease, and this Lyme vaccine which actually gave people Lyme, to changing definitions, altering diagnostic criteria, burying research, spreading misinformation, and purposefully keeping the medical community in the dark about what was going on. Someone, somewhere with a lot of power within the Deep State has purposely made it their mission to prevent the proper diagnosis, and treatment of Lyme disease and it isn’t over it. It is still happening.</p>

<p>Recently The Washington Post, owned by Jeff Bezos which is basically a propaganda rag for the CIA, recently ran this article: <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/to-your-health/wp/2017/06/15/dangerous-unproven-treatments-for-chronic-lyme-disease-cause-are-on-the-rise/?noredirect=on&amp;amp;utm_term=.c4e7605df558">https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/to-your-health/wp/2017/06/15/dangerous-unproven-treatments-for-chronic-lyme-disease-cause-are-on-the-rise/?noredirect=on&amp;utm_term=.c4e7605df558</a></p>

<p>Typically when they publish something like this, its either PR or a disinformation campaign. For some reason someone doesn&#39;t want Lyme patients getting stem cells? The insurance companies? Big pharma? I dunno.</p>

<p>According to my research, stem cells are a viable solution to healing the nervous system and repairing the damage caused by Lyme disease. Lyme often targets the nervous system, joints, and organs. Stem cells can repair nerves, joints, and organs. The person who blocked most stem cell research in the US was George W. Bush, while I believe he did so for personal religious reasons, his decision also benefited big pharma, and who ever doesn’t want people being cured of Lyme disease and many other conditions.</p>

<p>The stem cells required to treat Lyme do not need to be embryo based, in fact there are doctors like those at <a href="http://infusio.org/">http://infusio.org</a> who extract your own stem cells from your fat cells, then inject them into the blood stream so they go where they need to. This of course will set you back about $25,000 and a year of recovery time as the immune system reboots itself, and the stem cells repair the nervous system. They have a 85&amp;#37; success rate of a full recovery according to their marketing materials.</p>

<p>Just recently, congress finally passed funding to research Lyme disease (<a href="https://www.webwire.com/ViewPressRel.asp?aId=219152">https://www.webwire.com/ViewPressRel.asp?aId=219152</a>), which means the US government is finally potentially going to acknowledge that chronic Lyme disease actually exists, and actually research how it is being spread, how to treat it, and how to improve the CDC diagnostic criteria and treatment protocols. How long this will take, and if this research will be blocked in the future I don’t know, but this is at least a positive sign that there are forces within the government who are trying to fight the forces who are trying to keep people sick.</p>

<p>As mentioned, Lyme disease is grossly under reported, and due to the purposely incorrectly defined diagnostic criteria most people like myself go through the medical system for decades being misdiagnosed, drugged, and labeled as crazy until the point where we’re disabled. Only then do they sometimes acknowledge we have Lyme, but treatment options are pretty much stem cells and a few other fringe options at that point many of which are experimental, not peer-review researched, and prohibitively expensive and not covered by insurance.</p>

<p>Kaiser for example, does not recognize chronic Lyme disease and will not treat it. If someone tests positive they run a 30-day antibiotic treatment protocol, declare the patient cured, and don&#39;t approve any further action even if the patient still has symptoms. The insurance companies do not cover Lyme treatment, and most doctors who claim to be &quot;Lyme literate&quot; do not accept insurance.</p>

<p>There is seriously something funky going on here, even if all these conspiracies are true it doesn’t make sense why they would be still actively trying to block research, and potential treatments. I believe once properly researched its going to be a shit show. They&#39;re going to realize Lyme disease is likely an engineered biowpeaon, and that it is contagious, antibiotic resistant, and the points of contagion I suspect are way beyond a simple tick bite, but thanks to the Deep States fuckery we just simply do not know.</p>

<p>Almost everyone else I know who has Lyme shares a few common traits, they&#39;re almost all of European decent, and have empathic qualities or identify as empaths.</p>

<p>The thought that this disease was designed to target specific populations has crossed my mind before.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Don&#39;t watch Star Treck, so I can&#39;t tell you (had to Google just to find out who that was).</p>

<p>By empath, I mean someone who has empathic abilities to sense other peoples energy and other subtle energies.</p>

<p>This is totally based on my experience and from talking to other people with Lyme, but theres two theories I&#39;ve been working on regarding this.</p>

<p>1) Lyme degrades the myelin sheaths of nerves in the nervous system. This is the protective fatty cells around nerves (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myelin">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myelin</a>). Lyme feeds off these fats, and these nerve sheaths exposing the nerves to become more sensitive. These sensitivities lead to food allergies, chemical sensitivities, and in my experience EMF sensitivity. I know this sounds crazy, but yes I can sense wifi and other EMFs. I typically have to mediate or focus to be able to do it, but I can &quot;feel&quot; the subtle energy of EMFs. I can also feel subtle energy from people, objects with an electric charge, anything electronic, and also animals. This capacity for sensing EMFs and subtle energies makes me feel more connected to the world around me, which is both a wonderful and horrible thing at the same time. Sometimes its amazing for connecting with others, but all the electronic noise from EMFs can give me headaches, make me failure worse, make it harder for me to rest, etc.</p>

<p>2) The Lyme disease itself has a sort of &quot;intelligence&quot; or &quot;consciousness&quot; that affects the hosts consciousness. I mean if Lyme is a living being, be it a simple parasitic organism, it may have some capability of sensing or organizing with itself and other spirochetes and the cells around it as most parasites do. This could explain some of the neurological and psychological symptoms of the disease (aside from the fact that Lyme causes inflammation, and inflammation causes depression and mental illness).</p>

<p>Of these two theories, I believe 1 is the most probably by far, but 2 is a remote possibility that requires further research. Other parasites can and do have this capability, as do mushrooms, and other bacteria. So it is not completely outside the realm of possibility. Lyme has been proven to alter the DNA of its host, and that alone could trigger all kinds of reactions, including giving the Lyme patient additional senses.</p>

<p>I can tell you from talking to dozens of others with Lyme over the years that we all share common traits, are highly intuitive, and perceptive to things the average population has absolutely no awareness of. Again, I can&#39;t tell you if its because we were born this way and targeted or if the Lyme is doing something to us to give us these capabilities be it destroying our nerve sheaths or changing our DNA.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Quick question for you:</p>

<p>My ex-wife I had lyme ~1995.  She was treated with various drug and everything went away.  Later in life around 2008 she developed all sorts of problems and now has all sorts of auto-immune diseases and memory issues.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I am not a doctor, but yes that story is very common.</p>

<p>Lyme can go into remission, even I went into remission for many years after antibiotic treatments (they didn&#39;t think I had Lyme, but I kept getting infections they kept treating with antibiotics).</p>

<p>Remission can last a week, a month, a year, or even 10 years. If the Lyme goes into hiding in biofilms, it can remain until the biofilm is broken. A biofilm is basically a protective layer that forms around the Lyme organism that protects it from being killed, and if it not properly detoxed and the biofilm is formed in joints, the brian, or organ tissue it just hangs out until conditions are right and then it repopulates.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well I&#39;m here, and I have Lyme and I&#39;ve had it possibly for 27 years so I&#39;m pretty sure its real.</p>

<p>As for the Deep State fuckery, I don&#39;t know. As I mention someone to this day is pushing propaganda to discourage people from getting treatment with stem cells. While I do agree that stem cells are an experimental treatment, its perfectly logical to conclude that stem cells will help Lyme disease patients and I have no idea why the mainstream media would run articles telling people not to investigate them.</p>

<p>The fact The Washington Post is pushing this, and Congress just finally approved a research budget means this is still an ongoing battle. If it is eventually proven the US government did create Lyme, then that means the government is liable for my medical expenses, and the medical expenses of millions of other people who have this condition.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot; SS: Chronic Lyme disease is real. &quot;, try to prove it by science. We can&#39;t prove it&#39;s real with opinions and biases. If it was real, I think there would be real scientists that would prove it&#39;s real. There are thousands of scientists all around the world, but there is no real proof from it. You have pseudo-science-scientists who claim they know it, but they don&#39;t really have real proof (which can be accepted in real science). I don&#39;t say the people are faking it, I totally believe there are people with these symptoms. I believe there is something post-Lyme, but I don&#39;t believe in chronic Lyme (yet). Post-Lyme symptoms could also be caused by other factors: Did the tick carry other parasites/bacteria/viruses where the treatments didn&#39;t focus on? Maybe Lyme also causes an autoimmune disease?</p>

<p>There are no Lyme-literate doctors or Lyme-specialists. These are all names for alternative healthcare. People should be careful with antibiotic treatments, because it also halts the growth of GOOD bacteria.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Lyme is basically a catch all diagnosis for various spirochetes and co-infections. </p>

<p>The research into Lyme spirochetes forming biofilms has already been proven by scientists and peer reviewed. <a href="https://akademiai.com/doi/abs/10.1556/1886.2015.00049">https://akademiai.com/doi/abs/10.1556/1886.2015.00049</a></p>

<p>There’s other studies as well. This is the mechanism that makes chronic Lyme possible, and is essentially proof chronic Lyme exists.</p>

<p>Your not wrong to be skeptical, I don’t know who or what to trust as well. I can tell you though I don’t have a brain tumor, had an MRI and checked a few years ago.</p>

<p>Just got a positive that I have babseia, waiting until I get new insurance to test my blood to figure what type of Lyme and other coinfections I might have. But it’s more than likely I have chronic late stage 4 Lyme disease, and most of the medical professionals I’ve talked to all agree it is likely at this point. Considering I’m literally dying of this right now I can tell you it is sadly real. </p>

<p>To make matters worse, I gave some form of it to my girlfriend as she’s now presenting with symptoms and one of my ex-girlfriends from 9-years ago just reached out to me after we hadn’t talked since we broke up to tell me she has crippling joint pain and might have to stop working and go on disability. Her symptoms mirror my own, although she doesn’t seem to have as many neurological symptoms.</p>

<p>I’m trying to convince both my girlfriend and now my ex to get treatment so they don’t progress to the point I’m at. My ex is possibly stage 2-3, my current girlfriend is likely m stage 2, and I’m now stage 4 and declining rapidly.</p>

<p>So make of it what you will. But I have something and it’s contagious and matches the symptom profile of Lyme and it’s co-infections perfectly. Also live in an area with a lot ticks and easily could have contracted Lyme and any of its co-infections. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The attribution of chronic symptoms to Lyme disease is grossly out of proportion to its actual occurrence. In most longitudinal studies of Lyme disease, the prevalence of chronic post-treatment symptoms  <strong>is no higher than their prevalence in the population at large.</strong>  IOW: Post or &quot;chronic&quot; LD has actually been properly diagnosed as concurrent diseases and infections as diverse as multiple sclerosis, bacterial endocarditis, epidural abscess, and even bedwetting.</p>

<p>Lyme Disease itself is easily treated with standard antibiotic protocols. If it was truly a &quot;weaponized&quot; biomedical agent, surely its evil creators could have come up with a more commonly dispersed vector than the deer tick!

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>The mainstream view represented by the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) regards Lyme disease as difficult to catch and easy to cure with 2-4 weeks of antibiotics. The IDSA guidelines for treatment of Lyme disease maintain there is no credible evidence for chronic Lyme disease, and long-term treatment provides no benefit. For a patient to be diagnosed with Lyme, the IDSA guidelines require a positive result on the unreliable two-tier test, according to the narrow CDC case definition.   </p>

<p>The alternative view represented by the International Lyme and Associated Diseases Society (ILADS) maintains that Lyme disease is a serious national medical problem of epidemic proportion that needs to be researched, diagnosed, and treated aggressively. The ILADS guidelines recognize chronic Lyme and recommend that the duration of therapy be guided by clinical response rather than by an arbitrary treatment course.   </p>

<p>Hundreds of peer-reviewed articles support the ILADS position. Culture-confirmed cases of persistent infection in humans after short-term antibiotic treatment show that chronic Lyme disease is a very real and widespread problem.  </p>

<p>As I said in my post, Lyme is or has become antibiotic resistant. So this is simply no longer true, and theres literally 100s of medical research studies that have proven the prevalence of chronic Lyme disease.</p>

<p>Even Congress is researching this now because the CDC protocols are inefficient.</p>

<p>As I also mentioned, this potentially escaped the lab. I don&#39;t know if it was intended to be released upon the USA population but it did. I can hope that this was not released on purpose, and this was an accident, but alas it happened.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Actually, we&#39;re talking about the 50&#39;s, and possibly even as early as the 40&#39;s and 30&#39;s. This research likely began in Nazi Germany during WW2. The scientists who were working on it in Germany were then brought to the USA, and given high ranking positions within the US government including positions in the FDA and even NASA. This is all declassified.</p>

<p>Bioweapon research started during WW1, and progressed significantly during WW2.</p>

<p>Spirochetes are not an invention, but rather something that was naturally occurring in nature. They&#39;re a very ancient parasite and are related to bacteria, but again they are not bacteria.</p>

<p>According to Lab 257 they weaponized an existing parasite by creating a delivery method of using ticks to spread the disease. Ticks previous to this were likely not carriers. Meanwhile, the concentrations of spirochetes and their varieties were likely minimal. The concentrations and varieties of spirochetes combined in the ticks infected were done in a lab, and not naturally occurring.</p>

<p>All it would have taken was a scientist is to collect a variety of naturally occurring spirochetes in nature, and inject them into a single tick. Then when that tick bites a host, the host would then be exposed to dozens of different spirochetes. It is the concentration of multiple types of spirochetes and the introduction of them into the tick population that weaponized the disease. The only technology required is a tiny needle, and a microscope. It was totally doable in the 40&#39;s and 50&#39;s.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not sure I&#39;m understanding. Lyme is a spirochete, its a micro bacteria.

</blockquote>

<p>Its not anthrax where they literally concentrate a poison.  That doesn&#39;t just happen without genetic tampering and just letting it grow in a lab until something special happens seems very extremely slow.</p>

<p>I just feel like your being super vague about how they would go about creating that (while sort of correcting me) because you don&#39;t know the basics about genetic engineering.  It would be basically same process as how they took a Northern fish protein gene and wove it into strawberries so that they can survive frosts.  They do that a lot today.  Its simply possible that very specific small groups of people had knowledge of how to split genes from different organisms together 70 years ago.  It was probably slow and cumbersome to do but if they spent tons of money on it then they could have achieved it.</p>

<p>So lets say that they wanted to make something that attacked a certain type of tissue.  They could splice in some genes that can digest that tissue.  Then they could take that organism and feed it its normal type of food and then slowly reduce that food and add in the other type.  Those new spliced in genes might be recessive or unusable but somewhere in that organism is now the genetic material for dealing with that.  Eventually something will give and in this case the spirochete will mutate or otherwise figure out how to work with that food.  Then continue to decrease the ratio of the old food while increasing the new food and through selective pressure you can change it to feel like a new breed of organism.</p>

<p>Basically its a combination of genetic splicing and then selective breeding with carrot and stick to change it.  There are going to be all sorts of dead ends but eventually you can make something really nasty this way.</p>

<p>Say about the organism releasing a toxic chemical upon death, simply splice in a gene for producing a nasty protein into the gene and then associate it with the cells death sequence.  It takes a crazy amount of time for evolution to create very different new chemicals and there is a large cost to having a simple organism carry around all of this extra genetic information.  However, if you look deep in the oceans, forests, etc of the entire world then you can find some pretty potent things going on.  Then you put that together and train it through carrot and stick and over many lifecycles you can get it to do what you want.  If its radically too potent then it will just kill people and there will be obvious quarantines and sometimes that happens.</p>

<p>Lets say that you want to make a pathogen able to go suspended animation then splice in some genes from known organisms that do this and then continue to shock and then treat it until it figures out that it needs to say hide in a biofilm to survive the inhospitable times.  Then as its dying if it releases the nuero-toxin chemical then ease up on the bad treatment.  Good little boy!</p>

<p>Again all of this can be done without GE but there just isn&#39;t enough time in people&#39;s lives to do it.</p>

It is entirely possible they attempted something like this, we don&#39;t really know.

They knew ticks could host spirochetes without killing the host, making them the perfect delivery vehicle.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Someone messaged me privately after reading this who also has been diagnosed with Lyme and asked for more info on treatment. I figured I would share the reply I wrote to them here (I&#39;ve edited it and added some additional info that people might find useful):</p>

<p>There’s a lot of misinformation out there. </p>

<p>Unfortunately as a I posted Lyme may be antibiotic resistant and may require additional treatments such as ozone therapy, and herbal protocols.</p>

<p>Personally, I have tried and had some success with the <a href="http://buhnerhealinglyme.com/">http://buhnerhealinglyme.com</a> protocol. I currently use Buhner protocol herbs, mainly cats claw, and Japanese knotweed to keep my Lyme managed. However, this protocol has not cured me yet, and I&#39;ve only been doing it for a year.</p>

<p>There’s also the Cowden protocol: <a href="https://www.nutramedix.com/shop/cowden-support-program">https://www.nutramedix.com/shop/cowden-support-program</a></p>

<p>I have no used this protocol yet, but I do use some of the supporting herbs from it. Mainly Burbur and Pinella to manage herx reactions and brain fog (its great for detoxing the nervous system). <a href="https://www.nutramedix.com/burbur-pinella">https://www.nutramedix.com/burbur-pinella</a></p>

<p>These two herbs really help detox the brain, and I haven’t noticed any other side effects. It just does what it’s supposed to, and helps manage herx symptoms and brain fog. I just take about 20-30 drops before bed at night, and as needed during a herx.</p>

<p>Other herbs and treatments that I&#39;ve tried: various antibiotics (always get a herx from them, get much sicker, then get better but always relapse after stopping). Garlic, and olive leaf.</p>

<p>I still use olive leaf to boost my immune system daily, and its been crucial in helping me keep my Lyme managed.</p>

<p>Treatments I plan to try soon: fasting for 48-72 hours, 100&amp;#37; oregano oil (2 drops in water 2x per day), ozone therapy, IV therapy, and if all those fail stem cells. Also read about a treatment where they induce a 108 degree fever and put in in a coma for about 5 hours.</p>

<p>For fatigue, the best solutions I’ve found are sublingual B-12 (under the tongue, so you can bypass the digestive system), 5-MTHF (<a href="https://www.thorne.com/products/dp/5-mthf-1-mg">https://www.thorne.com/products/dp/5-mthf-1-mg</a>) which is a b vitamin that helps support the nervous system. If you have MTHFr genetic mutation this supplement is key to restoring your ability to detox properly. Took a month or two of supplementing for me to really notice a difference but now I can’t go without it. </p>

<p>CoQ10 can also help with fatigue and has been shown to help with Lyme fatigue.</p>

<p>The thing that helps me the most however is Cordyceps (<a href="https://hostdefense.com/products/cordyceps-capsules">https://hostdefense.com/products/cordyceps-capsules</a>). Cordyceps pretty much gave me my energy back. Mushrooms are incredibly healing and powerful. I also take the immune support blends from HostDefense, as well as Lions Maine which also helps with brain fog and nerves. </p>

<p>If there’s anything you take from this post, please look into the mushrooms. I can’t even put into words how much they’ve helped me turn the corner when it comes to fatigue and brain fog.</p>

<p>I also use CBD for pain management, but be careful. It can herx you, and finding the right clean / legal supplier is tricky depending on what state you’re in. Go slow and start low with anything new. CBD tinctures are great, I also like CBD patches a lot as they last up to 12-72 hours depending on the brand, and edible capsules are also great. I prefer either pure CBD patches, 3:1 CBD:THC tinctures, 2:1 edibles, and 1:1 when vaping or smoking. Different brands are different so try everything slowly and in moderation.</p>

<p>However, you also need to boost the bodies detox capabilities as you kill the Lyme it can flood the body with neurotoxins. If you catch the infection early and treat it aggressively you have a good chance of recovery after a few months to a year of treatment.</p>

<p>Common symptoms include brain fog, fatigue, memory issues, joint pain, depression, anxiety, mood swings, sweating, night sweats, swollen lymph nodes, bladder infections, reoccurring sinus infections, skin issues, digestive problems, alternating digestive issues. Etc. Co-infections like Candida and SIBO are common.</p>

<p>Diet is critical to recovery, r/zerocarb helps a lot of people recover as Lyme feeds off carbs and sugars.</p>

<p>I’ve been researching fasting as a treatment method and to speed up recovery as well. But I haven’t tried it past 24 hours yet. My research indicates 48-72 hours is required to get the desired results, and some people fast up to 21 days to eliminate Lyme but I don’t know enough to recommend this.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Silver does very very little orally, and topically is only good for skin infections in my experience. (Drank 3 bottles at one time, no hex, nothing.) As long as you use silver that has very small particles (ASAP is a good brand among others) it is totally safe. You might experience vein irritation and there is a Rx you can add to fix that. </p>

<p>I use a medical grade ozone machine. $1000 and a welders tank ($40) of pure o2. I worked up to 100oz of pure ozone air at rate of 1cc/30seconds. The worst side effect is it might hurt, like it does after you just sprinted, when you breath, but that can be avoided by showing the rate down. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I like <a href="http://www.meminerals.com/?cCheck=ON">Mother Earth Minerals</a>.</p>

<p>Silver, zinc and copper act as an immune system but they are each present in different overlapping fluids (sweat, blood, saliva, joints).  As OP mentioned parasites can release toxins to train us into not doing stuff that will kill them (ex. onions make me sick).  So its a process to get arid of a dug in parasite.  Best to have all of the minerals in your blood already and with healthy pH to start with.  The trick with minerals is that they need to be super tiny and it just turns out that plants have root filters that work that all out for us.  If its done industrially it just needs to be super high quality (very tiny particles) and I&#39;d wager that only 1-2% of it is high quality and even less in poor countries.  You can be poisoned by big particles while your body is starving of that same element.</p>

<p>Yeah breaking up biolfims is the hardest part. NAC + Harataki powder are my go to biofilm disrupters. Highly recommend the Harataki if you have GI issues as well, its a mild laxative but its really effective.</p>

<p>This is why I keep relapsing I think. I&#39;ll go into remission, then break up some more biofilms and I&#39;m right back into brain fog and lyme symptoms. Have to ramp up my Lyme killing herbs, then start herxing, have to back off them, detox, and repeat. Its been a year of doing this now, and 3 years in total since I first started herxing not knowing it was Lyme the first 2 years (thought it was just Candida and SIBO).</p>

<p>Further, the water/alcohol base that makes up most of the concoction is distilled (via centrifuge) from a strong mixture of the bacteria. So you&#39;re wrong saying &quot;it contains nothing&quot;.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve been asking the same things about women&#39;s diseases. Take endometriosis.. the medical community doesn&#39;t even know HOW endometriosis is caused, let alone have any real plan for treatment that isn&#39;t just birth control pills (which isn&#39;t even that effective and is nasty stuff anyway). There&#39;s no history about it, no major studies or trials... to me it&#39;s proof how much women have been disregarded historically. And it&#39;s not like it&#39;s an invisible and maybe psychological condition like fibromyalgia .. endometriosis tissue can grow on many internal organs and has been found in the brain (!!) and is removed during surgeries, usually only performed when someone is in debilitating pain or is a part of fertility treatment. Some people have pounds of it removed. It&#39;s so real and 1 in 10 women have it.</p>

<p>But mostly I think because medical research companies/pharma know we can deal with things like endometriosis, it&#39;s not really necessary/profitably for them to find a cure. The increased productivity that would occur from us being cured of endometriosis probably isn&#39;t worth the money it would cost to find a cure, so no one bothers. I bet it&#39;s a similar story with Lyme disease. People have dealt with it for decades, and maybe the cost of treatment would be so high they don&#39;t want to bother.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah I&#39;ve known a few women with endometriosis, have two ex&#39;s who have it now, and my own Sister has fibroids and is about to get surgery as she&#39;s trying to get pregnant but is struggling.</p>

<p>As for fibromyalgia, theres actually a possibility fibromyalgia is Lyme disease. Basically they created a condition to describe a symptom of Lyme, but ignore that Lyme is the cause. It is even possible that endometriosis has some kind of environmental cause or infectious cause and Lyme probably can&#39;t be ruled out yet either.</p>

<p>Basically, you can make more money treating the symptoms over the course of the patients life and let them die, than you can selling a cure which no longer requires future treatment. Its amazing how often the cure for a disease is something simple like baking soda, or not eating sugar, or eating organic, or taking some vitamin D, yet no one will ever tell you and you have to research it and find the solution yourself and trust some rando on the Internet.</p>

<p>While I do believe this is a factor with Lyme, theres also something else going on. The Deep State seems seriously preoccupied with preventing research and treatment of Lyme. I&#39;ve never seen any other medical condition or disease that the government is actively trying to stop people from getting treatment for. When it comes to endometriosis it is simply ignored, but when it comes to Lyme they actually try and stop people from getting treatment and even run propaganda stories in The Washington Post. It&#39;s bizarre.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There&#39;s a really good documentary called something like beneath the eight ball, or something very similar. It&#39;s a guy&#39;s story of his sister getting sick and then being fucked with by the medical community. He starts investigating, learns about Lyme disease, and where it probably came from. The eight ball is a reference to a huge metal sphere on pine island where they used to test biological agents. Highly recommend</p>

<p>Didn&#39;t bother with the ELISA or Western blot, seemed like a waste of time and money from my research.</p>

<p>I have had herx reactions from antibiotics many times, my symptom profile fits, and I have tried over a dozen different anti-microbials that kill Lyme and they all cause a herx reaction. Even iodine, and garlic gave me herx reactions.</p>

<p>There&#39;s pretty much nothing else that will cause severe herx reactions from garlic, antibiotics, and iodine.</p>

<p>Also my blood tests indicated decreasing neutrophils, and increasing lymphocytes for 4 years straight which is a common indicator of an infection.</p>

<p>There is also the fact I have made some progress since treating for Lyme, my rashes are gone, my IBS is gone, my depression is gone, my anxiety is greatly reduced, and my nervous system is improving. Not out of the woods yet, but I am not declining as rapidly as I was.</p>

<p>In addition to all of that, I&#39;ve consulted with several Lyme doctors to evaluate different protocols and all of them agree I have Lyme. </p>

<p>As well as the swollen lymph nodes in my neck and head I have all the common indicators of an active infection of some kind.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;purposely incorrectly defined diagnostic criteria most people like myself go through the medical system for decades being misdiagnosed, drugged, and labeled as crazy&quot;</p>

<p>sorry, but you ARE crazy for going to a doctor.</p>

<p>&quot;disease&quot; as the medical industrial complex would define it is a MYTH and all so called &quot;causes&quot; and &quot;solutions&quot; are based on THEORIES which have been proven time and time again to be false, while the true knowledge of human health is suppressed, resulting in medical doctors killing and maiming more people than any war.</p>

<p>lyme disease is a shitshow because the entire concept of diseases is a shitshow. the symptoms and confusion surrounding it can be cured the same way any other &quot;disease&quot; can be cured: by strengthening your immune system, fasting, a healthy diet, and a positive lifestyle ie LOVE AND OXYGEN.</p>

<p>and the fact that this post is on the front page of this BS &quot;conspiracy&quot; sub is proof enough that it is a non issue.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Its hard to say.</p>

<p>If the immune system is strong, you can keep the Lyme in remission, and some people go into remission for years. Decades even.</p>

<p>Meanwhile if you went on antibiotics it could have put it into remission as well.</p>

<p>Yes, I experience grinding and clicking in my joints and tendons. My ankles, knees, hips, wrists, and neck are the most affected. Ankles grind, and pop. Knees just hurt. Right hip I can pop. Neck grinds and pops. Shoulders can pop and click as well.</p>

<p>Joint issues can also result from auto-immune disorders, genetics, and nutritional deficiencies so you need to rule those out. If it is Lyme, you&#39;ll likely have more symptoms than just joint issues.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My NP was convinced it was everything but Lyme.  Took me a few months to get to a Lyme specialist.  I was so sick, I ended up on disability.  The sepcialist gave me 60 days of doxy instead of the 30 days.  As he explained it - &quot;Spirochetes were working on you for months before you got a diagnosis and treatment protocol.  A few dollars of antibiotics is a wise investment to make sure they&#39;re all dead.&quot;</p>

<p>Doxy was the worst antibiotic that I ever had to take.  And the herx reaction was very severe - basically a couple weeks looking like i just had a stroke.  But I came out of it better.</p>

<p>If you get diagnosed, ask about extending the antibiotics.  Even if insurance won&#39;t cover it, you&#39;re spending like $5.  Ironically, it&#39;s probably going to be cheaper getting the script filled WITHOUT filing it with your insurance anyway (co-payment).</p>

<p>And also - pay attention to your daily nutrition.  Eat wholesome foods.  Get plenty of rest (you&#39;re body is stressed to the max).  Consider a quality nutrition supplement (I like the whole food based vitamins, personally).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I help patients with their medical bills for lyme disease treatment, and it is inhumane the lack of affordable access to treatment. Lyme Disease is a terrible disease, with the average patient spending years to get a diagnosis only to find they are forced to spend their life savings for the chance to get better. </p>

<p>Infusio is one of the clinics I work with, and is paving the way for stem cells and their applications to chronic illness. It is unfortunate that $25k is actually one of the cheaper treatment programs I see patients going to. </p>

<p>I have spoken with people who literally mortgage their home, cash in retirement funds, cash in their children&#39;s college funds, and max out credit cards to afford these very expensive treatment programs, with the average patient we help spending between $15-100k. </p>

    <div class="md"><p><strong>Acute Lyme Disease</strong></p>

<p>A young woman in Pennsylvania was bitten by a pathogen-carrying tick, developed the classical Lyme-associated rash, and proceeded to get very ill over the next seven to ten days. She received several infusions of vitamin C at her house. The first infusion was 100 grams, and her caregiver reported that she seemed much improved upon the completion of that infusion. Five more infusions of 50 grams each were given over the next two days. By the time that 72 hours had passed, she was completely well, never having a clinical relapse or any chronic Lyme symptoms.</p>

<p><strong>Chronic Lyme Disease</strong></p>

<p>A woman with a 12-year history of chronic Lyme disease, documented by blood testing, desired having regular and prolonged high-dose intravenous vitamin C therapy for her condition. Under the aegis of a prescribing physician who had attended one of my presentations of vitamin C, a nurse practitioner was able to give the patient what she wished.</p>

<p>This individual had already been taking liposome-encapsulated vitamin C and glutathione orally without a significant improvement in her condition. On four consecutive days, she received infusions of 25, 50, 75, and then 100 grams of vitamin C. Then, for 19 more days, she received 5 or 6 infusions weekly of 100 grams of vitamin C in each infusion. Until day 23, she felt no improvement. However, she was determined to continue in spite of the lack of improvement and the increasing expense of the whole process. On day 23, the nurse practitioner reported that she looked like a new person, and that it was like a &quot;switch was flipped&quot; and she was well. At her request, the patient received another week of 100 gram daily infusions to be sure her condition was truly resolved, a very good idea on her part. About a month later, her Lyme blood testing was completely negative.</p>

<p>A physician reported to me similar experiences with a series of Lyme patients, who showed no positive clinical response after an extended number of vitamin C infusions, then had a dramatic, abrupt clinical resolution of their condition, very much as described above.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Been researching vitamin C therapy as well. I actually take 3-5grams of buffered vitamin C daily to help with inflammation and I do respond to it, and it does help.</p>

<p>The problem is finding a doctor who can do it through an IV that won&#39;t charge you thousands of dollars. Its super cheap to make, but the doctors I talked to charge as much as $850 just to even have an initial appointment so I haven&#39;t bothered. Might revisit it if I can find a doctor will to do it at a reasonable price.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s weird seeing Lyme disease discussed on conspiracy boards for me. Raised in the South, Lyme disease was one of those old fashioned fears a lot of people had, as it&#39;s something you can get from ticks (albeit rare) that will absolutely fuck your life up. Even the doctors around here are afraid of it. It&#39;s a major pain in the ass to treat, not to mention the treatments might straight up kill you if they guessed wrong. I can completely believe that Lyme disease could turn into a chronic problem, thankfully I&#39;ve never directly heard of it happening. One of the benefits of living in a place where tick-bourne illness is on people&#39;s minds is that things like Lyme disease are on the mental checklist, and the people that I&#39;ve heard of catching it get it taken care of before it&#39;s too late.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is my opinion, as someone who has suffered from a similar illness. I&#39;ve researched a lot into these subjects and this is what I&#39;ve come to believe as to &quot;why <em>they</em> don&#39;t want a cure&quot;:</p>

<p>Because the symptoms of Chronic Lyme are not caused by an active infection, but from post-infection damage to the brain/immune system. Essentially, after a major trauma to your immune system (i.e. Lyme disease), your brain can suffer damage that results in faulty immune system functioning. What this means is that any actual cure is likely to involve repairing the damage or retraining the immune system through either neural retraining or cures like stem cells. Pharmaceutical-based treatments aren&#39;t effective (as of now) because (a) they can&#39;t actually address the dysfunction, just manage certain symptoms that result from it, and (b) </p>

<p>What both of these treatments (e.g. neural retraining, stem cells) have in common is that they address the root causes of the symptoms and repair damage, rather than managing symptoms. As well, both of these treatments would not only be able to help heal Chronic Lyme but a wide range of autoimmune conditions and diseases, including many that are currently big boons for the pharmaceutical industry.</p>

<p>For instance, imagine if IBS or arthritis could be cured cheaply and quickly using one of these treatments, rather than through life-long medication. Imagine if stem cells were legitimized as a treatment option, what would happen to pharmaceutical companies&#39; current treatment options for a wide swath of conditions. There&#39;s a big incentive to not legitimize these types of treatments, and to not legitimize any illnesses which can only be cured through them. </p>

<p>So this is why you won&#39;t see any medical-sanctioned treatment for Chronic Lyme any time soon. You won&#39;t even see it acknowledged as a real illness, not until there&#39;s a viable pharmaceutical treatment option. Only then will the medical establishment acknowledge it as a real illness. </p>

<p>All illness which fall under this constellation of multi-symptom, no-known cause (such as CFS, IBS, Gulf War syndrome, etc, etc.) are under-researched, ignored, or flat-out denied as being real, as they pose a threat to Big Pharma. </p>

<p>That&#39;s my own personal belief. I could be wrong, but I&#39;m basing this on my own reading and experience over the years. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I share a similar view, although the odd thing with Lyme disease is it isn&#39;t just a disease that&#39;s ignored. It is a disease that is has major origin issues, ongoing political implications, and a history likely tied to bioweapons research. It isn&#39;t just ignored, its something the Deep State (which includes big Pharma), doesn&#39;t want researched beyond just profit motive.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The Op Paperclip theory is just one theory of its potential origin. We know it most likely came from Plum Island, the possible Nazi connection is fascinating, but ultimately its still the US Governments fault. Even if it was a former Nazi researcher, they were brought here by the US Government to research this stuff, and then were negligent enough to allow it to escape the lab.</p>

<p>So was it Nazi scientist like the one who worked at Plum Island? I dunno. Was it someone who worked for the US government? Almost certainly likely.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I would be inclined to believe this as I know how nasty Lyme is however there is one thing that I think disproves this theory. There was a frozen man discovered in the French Alps dating  thousands of years. They analysed his body to see what his diet was and what he died from. Turns out he suffered from Lyme disease. So this means Lyme existed since a long time ago. Maybe it just has mutated to a more powerful strain since but it wasn’t created in a lab. Maybe it was enhanced to be used a biological weapon by the nazis doing research for the U.S. government after WW2 who knows.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It wasn&#39;t Lyme. Borrelia has been around as long as we&#39;ve been around. Something happened to the genetics of borrelia near plum island. It produced borrelia that caused inflammation and thus disease. Whether Lyme was/is a bioweapon we may never know. Certainly possible. Soft kill politics.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Some people think that ticks also carry a lot of parasites with them. We don&#39;t yet know a lot about parasites, so this could also be something we don&#39;t yet spend a lot of attention to. Parasites could also cause inflammation and other symptoms. I live in the Netherlands, and we have some islands where the majority of the tick population has lyme. The ticks with lyme/parasites only live in the dunes, and it was already long known to the islanders that they shouldn&#39;t walk in the dunes (time wise, we&#39;re talking about 80-year old people who knew that they shouldn&#39;t walk in the dunes.)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thank you for this. My... Integrative medicine doc wants me to get tested for Lyme. I read into it, and the symptoms match so much. If I could go without this pain, then life would be easy mode. Same with the bipolar and ADD</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The mental stuff might actually be Lyme, they tried to slap all kinds of mental diagnosis on me and most of my issues went away once I got my Lyme in remission. Of course, now I&#39;m relapsing and some of those symptoms are back, but it is something to look into.</p>

<p>Currently trying to figure out what my next treatment option is, I am exploring doing hyperbaric oxygen treatments as well as fasting occasionally. Apparently hyperbaric treatments are fairly effective for late stage cases, and compared to some treatments are a bit more reasonably priced. It would still be about $5000-10,000 for total treatment, but compared to other treatment options that&#39;s cheap, and its been studied and worked on others with late stage Lyme as well. Something to consider.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Upstate New Yorker/ Vermonter reporting in here, I feel like Lyme is everywhere. Ticks certainly are. And I’m convinced this is why so many of us in the northeast are so depressed and achy. That and the lack of sunshine for 7+ months of the year. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well I&#39;m here, and I have Lyme and I&#39;ve had it possibly for 27 years so I&#39;m pretty sure its real.</p>

<p>As for the Deep State fuckery, I don&#39;t know. As I mention someone to this day is pushing propaganda to discourage people from getting treatment with stem cells. While I do agree that stem cells are an experimental treatment, its perfectly logical to conclude that stem cells will help Lyme disease patients and I have no idea why the mainstream media would run articles telling people not to investigate them.</p>

<p>The fact The Washington Post is pushing this, and Congress just finally approved a research budget means this is still an ongoing battle. If it is eventually proven the US government did create Lyme, then that means the government is liable for my medical expenses, and the medical expenses of millions of other people who have this condition.</p>

<p>Back before it was called Lyme, it was known as Montauch&#39;s knee by the fisherman in the Plum Island/Lyme CT area. </p>
