    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t rule out the possibility of ET life. In fact, I feel that based on the size of the Universe it&#39;s almost impossible for there <em>not</em> to be any. Of course, it gets difficult to determine just how much life there might actually be out there- and if it is sentient or not. Perhaps only a handful of sentient species arise per galaxy- perhaps only one? Perhaps sentient Life exists but is very rare...or perhaps the universe is crammed full of it. Honestly, at this point, there&#39;s no way to know.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>FTL travel is actually theoretically possible without breaking the laws of physics with something like the Alcubierre Drive. If you compress spacetime in front of you and expand it behind you you could effectively travel faster than light through space without ever exceeding the speed of light locally. This would require exotic matter with the properties of negative mass. We currently don&#39;t know if any such matter exists, but if we discover matter with the properties we need it would be possible.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yea good point. Even though nothing can travel faster than light, space itself is not bound by that. That&#39;s also how we end up with the &quot;observable universe&quot; because beyond that line space is expanding faster than light can travel, so we&#39;ll never know what is beyond. I forgot all about the Alcubierre drive. I guess negative mass is theoretically possible on paper. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I could easily counter with my own link that shows lensing, relativity or gravitational waves but I&#39;d rather discuss it. I&#39;m going to assume that you don&#39;t accept pictures from telescopes as evidence. Special relativity follows from two postulates: The speed of light is the same for all observers, and the laws of physics work the same in any non accelerating frame (if you were trapped in a box with no windows, you would be unable to determine whether the box is moving or at rest through observation). Which of those do you disagree with? General relativity introduces another postulate that in the same box, gravity is indistinguishable from acceleration. You wouldn&#39;t be able to tell whether you were on the surface of a planet or accelerating upwards at a constant rate. Upon proving these, all of special and general relativity follows.</p>

<p>The historical Aristotle figure actually never existed in this reality, but was inserted into the historical record by a secret band of renegade Russian scientists trying to fix the Mandela Effect anomalies created by the CERN disaster.  As a test case, they used the story of the imaginary philosopher to test their method of mass mind control by seeing how many people they could get to believe in a wise ancient Greek who had most of the the really good basic ideas before anyone else.

<p>&quot;The test of a first-rate intelligence is the ability to hold two opposing ideas in mind at the same time and still retain the ability to function.&quot; ~ F. Scott Fitzgerald</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sure! I usually start by going back to the origin of any concept/idea/quote etc -- so, in these two cases, these are good reading starting points/origins:</p>

<p>The Fitzgerald quote comes from a really under-appreciated series of essays in Esquire:  <a href="https://www.esquire.com/lifestyle/a4310/the-crack-up/">https://www.esquire.com/lifestyle/a4310/the-crack-up/</a></p>

<p>Keats&#39; &quot;negative capability&quot; first showed up in a letter to George and Tom Keats: <a href="https://genius.com/John-keats-negative-capability-letter-to-george-and-tom-keats-annotated">https://genius.com/John-keats-negative-capability-letter-to-george-and-tom-keats-annotated</a></p>

<p>Beyond that, any reading rec would depend on what sort of literature is your &quot;thing&quot; -- i.e. poetry, fiction, non-fiction etc?</p>

<p>But generally speaking, I&#39;m a big fan of modernists like Fitzgerald (of course, &quot;The Great Gatsby&quot;, but also lesser known works such as &quot;The Diamond as Big as the Ritz&quot;, from &quot;Tales of the Jazz Age&quot;).</p>

<p>Now, regarding Keats, it&#39;s tough to read him in isolation, i.e. apart from the other romantic poets: Shelley, Wordsworth, Coleridge and Byron.  </p>

<p>Here two of my favorite Keats poems, To Autumn: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/To_Autumn">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/To_Autumn</a>
and On First Looking into Chapman&#39;s Homer: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On_First_Looking_into_Chapman%27s_Homer">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On_First_Looking_into_Chapman%27s_Homer</a></p>

<p>If you consider that he died at age 25, his creative output was staggering...not only did he write poetry, he also wrote prodigious &quot;letters&quot; (more a road map to his and his fellow romantic poets&#39; vision than traditional letters).</p>

<p>Here&#39;s a good intro to Keats: <a href="https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poets/john-keats">https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poets/john-keats</a></p>

<p>I don&#39;t know if this is what you were looking for in terms of reading recs -- if you&#39;d like other reading recs beyond these two writers, just let me know. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Two opposing circle jerks are too busy one upping each other to fuck over the common bloke. That&#39;s why even in it&#39;s current state, the UK works better than the US system. It&#39;s not a strong Monarch, but instead of a strong Monarch one upping a strong parliament and vice versa, you have several very strong personalities one uping each other. So it&#39;s functionally the same. But the key point is that the common people do not choose the prime minister. Instead they choose their local minister. And the minister has to deal with all sides, not just the one that won the vote. This counters the mob rule of democracy. The minister that is the majority (not necessarily the most popular) gets to choose the prime minister, who still also had to represent their own constituents while being prime minister.</p>

<p>This forces all MPs to be on equal footing no matter who is the majority, and many times the majority is not the most popular, but instead a coalition between minority parties.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That’s happened more after the 2015 title II legislation than before it, and I haven’t heard of it once since the repeal.</p>

<p>You can also find plenty of cases where net neutrality laws were broken (before the 2015, now repealed, law) and the FCC stepped in to protect net neutrality (as in the 2009 case where AT&amp;T blocked voip services on cell phones using their 3g). I mean good for them, but the result was actually pretty great for companies and pretty bad for consumers: the death of unlimited data caps.  For people like me, I would much prefer to have voip blocked when off WiFi and just use my phone as, well, a phone during that time if it meant I could still have unlimited data.  The title II legislation made this action (which was already handled in the way the people who cried about the repeal would want) officially illegal, but in more general terms.  Instead of having a hearing about if the action was harmful, deceitful or violated first amendment rights, it’s just plain illegal.  I’d liken it to assault cases becoming tone-deaf to self-defense.</p>

<p>Once official, the ability for a smaller telecom upstart to offer faster services to rural areas for cheaper by, say, publicly not allowing Netflix (at some point over half of internet traffic) was gone.  There is nothing unlawful, harmful, or deceitful about allowing a consumer a greater range of choices.  Since the big bucks were needed to handle ALL traffic equally (which they still didn’t do before, after, or during the legislations lifespan) we are left with telecom giants that are pretty much universally hated and pushed the very hardest to keep title II in place.</p>

<p>Now the door is open to companies that can better tailor to specific subsets without forcing them to subsidize other customers with larger data consumption.  It doesn’t make any of the shady things that have been complained about legal, but it allows an honest path for similar arrangements to exist in broad daylight, rather than illegally in secret.  It also prevents what happened with cellular data, strict data caps, from becoming universal (which began happening during title II, though with much larger caps than cell phones)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Its potentially the mark of an educated mind as it does take time and practice to gain the <em>ability</em> to entertain contradictory ideas without acceptance or the ability to comprehend the magic of paradox. </p>

<p>I also think its the mark of a certain <em>type</em> of mind. We could debate a nature/nurture model for causality or with a reincarnation model a mind with this inherent ability perhaps belongs to a consciousness thats a little more evolved.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think part of the problem here is part and parcel with the mindset you get from &quot;waking up&quot;.</p>

<p>Suddenly the talking head on your TV may no longer be being truthful, and some &quot;crazy&quot; youtuber might actually be on to something. As an extension of that, any given thread or comment could just as easily be real as it could be a shill or bot on a misinformation campaign.</p>

<p>I think the only cure for this is citations. If someone is making big claims they would need to provide some kind of bold evidence. Or at least that&#39;s where I draw my line between what I can honestly discuss vs bullshit. We can entertain any idea you could come up with, but I will not be able to take it seriously without any evidence at all.</p>

<p>So be civil. Be skeptical. Check your sources. If you&#39;re going to participate in the discussion, come with an open mind and a healthy distrust.even if you don&#39;t buy the evidence presented you should still be able to entertain the idea, at least to the point of being able to debunk it with counter points.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This quote applies to so many things.. Flat Earth theory for example.  Instead of immediately dismissing it because it sounds stupid, the smallest bit of research will inform you that many images of the Earth are composites, it&#39;s quite difficult to measure the curve of the Earth and NASA has a dark history.  <strong>Doesn&#39;t mean the Earth is flat.</strong>
It&#39;s like researching a topic you don&#39;t agree with for a debate, you don&#39;t have to accept it to understand it or the perspectives of others.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Your post points to something that I find curious in conspiracy discussions.  I agree with OP.  Persons need to be able to engage with an idea / theory without thinking it true.  The curiosity is how that idea of &quot;thinking it true&quot; relates to this line:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>And I will not be changing my life style in preparation for a green invasion.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>For a significant number of conspiracies, there seem to be energetic arguments regarding the truth of the conspiracy with fervent rhetoric on both sides.  Yet nowhere in the discussion is there any mention of the practical consequences of believing, or not believing, the conspiracy.</p>

<p>Said another way:  Flat earthers seem to not <em>do</em> anything different from oblate spheroid earthers.</p>

<p>So a flat earther will pound on the desk to demand that others accept that theory as true, and yet there are not practical consequences to the belief...other than changing the position one argues.  Or they will adamantly refuse to engage the idea that earth is an oblate spheroid without any....well, reason.</p>

<p>It&#39;s not like in order to engage with the oblate spheroid theory a flat earther would have to wear a different hat, or forego a particular food.  There is nothing lost or gained in switching one&#39;s view.  And yet the absolutely refuse to do so.</p>

<p>So that&#39;s my curiosity, the thing I kinda don&#39;t <em>get</em> with conspiracies.  Take the example I quoted:  If belief in UFOs required that one construct a bomb shelter, like you could not conceptually grasp and entertain the idea of UFOs unless you physically made a bomb shelter, then I would totally understand an unwillingness to entertain the idea.  I don&#39;t like working with my hands, so I wouldn&#39;t  conceive a belief that required me to work with my hands.</p>

<p>But having an idea in one&#39;s mind does not require any physical labor, any significant change to the ordinary routine of one&#39;s life.  You don&#39;t have to <em>do</em> anything.  You just have to <em>think</em> some different ideas.</p>

<p>Nothing practical seems to ride on many of these conspiracies.  So why are adherents of particular theories so adamant about defending them and so obstinate in their refusal to conceive a different story?  If these beliefs do not force life style changes, why do people get so pissy about them?</p>

<p>That is my curiosity.  And something about the way OP phrased the post poked me in a way that resulted in my typing this out.  Do with it what you will.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>TOTALLY agreed, and a quote I have been referencing myself of late!</p>

<p>unfortunately this is a particular problem in politics... one MUST consider the alternative viewpoints if ANY sort of consensus is ever going to be made.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not gonna touch your UFO example... that would take us WAY OT.... lets go more extreme as an example.... Chem Trails, or even the Illuminati Lizard people.... both subjects I have opted to investigate recently to see if there was any substance to claims, why people believe such things and to attempt to understand the thinking behind those who push such theories.... and in entertaining the thinking (as per Aristotle) I might learn something along the way or understand my fellow humans and their thought processes better. I apologise for the length, but think this is a good example of how something good can come out of looking at even the most extreme theories and considering other points of view.  Discoveries after all only come from  things we THOUGHT we knew and understood and are rarely expected. Challenging our notions is a good thing, as they will either alter with the new information... are be confirmed and further solidified in our minds</p>

<p>what did I learn?????  that the Lizard thing is essentially a one man roadshow, however his Illuminati discussion introduced me to Zbigniew Brzezinski... a person I had never heard of before, but is essentially responsible for the world we live in right now (he outlined the patriot act and reduction of freedoms in the 70&#39;s, lied about funding the Mujahadeen in Afghanistan to DRAW Russia into it&#39;s &#39;own Vietnam&#39; and has more blood on his hands than Henry Kissinger! Also the diving force behind the current Anti-Russia sentiment.... launching it with the first opinion piece...&quot;Crimea, what to do about Russia&quot;, not to mention why he has a personal hard on against Russia (His Polish father was an Ambassador there during the Stalin era)  - Paradigm changing info, which I only discovered thanks to researching Lizard people... yet nothing to do with Lizards</p>

<p>Chem Trails - there are legitimate cloud formation concerns and how extra WATER VAPOUR from CONtrails is impacting cumulus cloud formation rainfall and weather....  The NASA research had to be shut-down as it became too sensitive to the chemtrail crowd... so it is being quietly ignored.  Add to that some pretty bad science (assuming chemtrails are the sole source of heavy metals found in remote locations), and NASA doing &#39;worst case scenario disaster planning&#39; involving geo engineering, without properly explaining what they are doing... and without looking at human impact factors of the chemicals they are looking at... there is easily enough ammo to get a conspiracy theory rolling.</p>

It&#39;s not a strong Monarch, but instead of a strong Monarch one upping a strong parliament and vice versa, you have several very strong personalities one uping each other. So it&#39;s functionally the same. But the key point is that the common people do not choose the prime minister. Instead they choose their local minister. And the minister has to deal with all sides, not just the one that won the vote. This counters the mob rule of democracy. The minister that is the majority (not necessarily the most popular) gets to choose the prime minister, who still also had to represent their own constituents while being prime minister.</p>

<p>This forces all MPs to be on equal footing no matter who is the majority, and many times the majority is not the most popular, but instead a coalition between minority parties.</p>
