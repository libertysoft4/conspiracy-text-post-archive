        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>By Chris Kanthan</p>

<p>Disneyland is the Happiest Place on Earth! Millions of families visit the theme park every year to enjoy the magical place of rides, spectacular shows and cheerful cartoon figures. Everything is clean, perfect and joyful. Unless … you realize that Cinderella might actually be homeless. That’s right, 10% of Disneyland’s employees are actually homeless, many more are on food stamps, and 75% struggle to make ends meet.</p>

<p>Does this ring familiar? Think of America. Behind the façade of being the greatest country on Earth with the largest GDP and the wealthiest billionaires, there are tens of millions of Americans who are left behind just like Disney’s employees.</p>

<p>This neo-feudalistic model isn’t isolated to Disney or Walmart, it’s systemic. For example, the bus driver at Apple – which has $280 billion in cash – is forced to sleep in a van because he can’t afford the Silicon Valley rent; Facebook’s cafeteria workers live in a garage; and thousands of American Airlines’ employees are forced to depend on food stamps.</p>

<p>America is being eaten alive by corporate greed; and Disneyland has been taken over by Scrooge.</p>

<p>Let’s look at some Disney Inc. statistics.</p>

<p>Total profit per year: $9 billion</p>

<p>Total employees: 200,000</p>

<p>Notice that the profit reflects what’s left after all the expenses, including the salaries, have been paid. So, in a utopian world, the Disney management will do the math ($9 billion / 200,000 = $45,000) and send a check for $45K to every employee, Mickey included. That kind of profit-sharing would really make Disneyland the happiest place on Earth. Does that happen? No way!</p>

<p>Does Cinderella get a check for perhaps $20K, $10K, $5K or even $1K? Nope, nope, nope, nope. Cinderella gets nada, zero, zilch. She should be content with the $12/hour salary and must smile happily for the kids.</p>

<p>In Disneyland, Cinderella never gets to meet her prince.</p>

<p>Disney’s CEO gets paid $46 million a year, which translates to $23,000 an hour. Imagine Disney’s CEO coming to work on Jan 2nd. He wishes a few people “happy new year,” orders coffee, sits on his desk, makes a few phone calls … and he has already made more money than what Ariel would make during the rest of the year.</p>

<p>Of course, the CEO should get paid more, but does he deserve a salary that’s equivalent to 2,000 Disney employees? If the CEO doesn’t show up for work for a day, Disneyland will continue running. If 2,000 employees take a day off, the park would be shut down.</p>

<p>In the 1960s, the CEO-to-worker salary ratio was 25. Today it’s often 600 or more, sometimes even more than 1000 (for example, at Walmart). Much of the executive compensation comes in the form of stock options and bonuses based on stock performance. In a rational and unrigged world, the CEOs would increase their revenues and profits to get bonuses. Not anymore.</p>

<p>Now, the CEOs simply use a no-brainer solution to boost the stock prices – it’s called stock buybacks or share repurchases. This involves a firm using corporate profits (or even borrowed money) to buy its own stocks. BTW, this used to be illegal until the 1980s.</p>

<p>Since 2007, US corporations have spent trillions of dollars on stock buybacks. In 2018 alone, they will spend$800 billion on this financial engineering tool (which has also led to a massive stock market bubble). They won’t use the billions to hire Americans, boost wages or innovate new products. Instead, the CEOs will buy yachts and tell you that Chinese or Mexicans stole your jobs.</p>

<p>Do the low-wage employees of Disneyland get any shares or stock options? A silly question, indeed.</p>

<p>Thus we have a situation where American employers ruthlessly exploit American workers. This isn’t a good model for a country. China and Mexico don’t make us poor; predatory capitalism does.</p>

<p>Paying good wages to hardworking employees is not socialism or communism. Henry Ford understood this when he more than doubled the wages of his workers in 1914.</p>

<p>However, hundred years later, maximizing profit has become a fundamentalist dogma. You can imagine a conversation among the factory-farming executives:</p>

<p>Guy #1: Why the heck are these chickens roaming out in the farms? We would save so much money if we lock them up in cages.</p>

<p>Guy #2: Brilliant idea! Let’s lock up five chickens in a cage. We will save more. More is always better.</p>

<p>Guy #3: I really don’t understand why we feed them expensive salads and healthy stuff. Let’s feed them cheap GMO corn and GMO soy from my friends at Monsanto.</p>

<p>Guy #4: Experts tell me that if we give them caffeine and anti-depressants, the chickens will stay awake longer, eat more, and get fatter.</p>

<p>Secret $1.8 Million Cryptocurrency Script
Guy #5: And when they get sick, load them up with antibiotics and steroids.</p>

<p>Guy #5: These stupid chickens are also so small. Let’s drug them with some growth hormones. I am getting a lot of pressure from the private equity funds about profits per chicken.</p>

<p>Apart from being inhumane and psychopathic, this system forgets or ignores the fact that we have to eat these chickens. Sick chicken = sick people. Call it Karma or “revenge of the chickens.”</p>

<p>Similarly, poor workers = poor country. And you can imagine a similar conversation among corporate executives regarding workers – “cut their wages and benefits”, “make them work overtime”, “hire part-time employees rather than full-time” and so on.</p>

<p>You can’t grow the economy if American workers don’t get paid enough, especially by profitable multi-billion dollar corporations. 2/3rd of our GDP is based on consumer spending. It’s no wonder that in the last ten years, the US economy cumulatively grew only by a dismal 35%. Compare that to China, which grew by an astounding 200% during that same period.</p>

<p>And it’s not a coincidence that China’s average wages have more than doubled in the same period. </p>

<p>Housing within 30 minutes of Google Bus Driver&#39;s job is rough.  $750/mo for a room in a house, minimum, outside weird circumstances (live-in aide, yardwork, etc).  A studio in SF or Silicon Valley is waaaaaay outside Google Bus Driver reach unless s/he has rent control (and therefore has been in place prior to getting Google Bus Driver job).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Lol, the downvotes for truthful insight from someone who lived near Disney and had several friends employed there...</p>

<p>Friend 1. Cosmetology student employed for the bippityboppity boutique. Worked the entire summer, full room and board and made 15$ an hour</p>

<p>Friend 2. Was a fairy godmother, worked both over spring and winter breaks, full room and board</p>

<p>Friend 3. Was one of the Cinderellas, worked summer and fall for 3 years. Same deal on the room and board etc etc</p>

<p>I can&#39;t speak to how their typical full time adult employees are treated but their internships are pretty great, which most of their employees are seasonal to some extent.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You do know that they take portions of that our of salary, right? I&#39;ve had multiple friends (college friends, mind you) that worked as characters and servers at restaurants there. Disney pays ~on par with what your average college student would make at any job above fast food/retail. But they take out money for room and board, food, transportation, etc. Then you dive into how the employees are treated by the customers AND management, combined with 12 hour days (on average) 6 days a week? C&#39;mon guy, it&#39;s not a great place to work.</p>

<p>If you really don&#39;t believe me hit up GlassDoor and type in &quot;Disney <em>any job but CEO/Upper Management</em>&quot; almost all of them have the same exact ratings (shilled much?) of 3.7 stars, but it does fluctuate between 3.5 and 3.9 if you scroll all the way through the dozens of pages. $9-$12 MAXIMUM for general labor force.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Capitalism is a Marxist word, so I generally avoid it, because of its ambiguity. If the banker who bribes government to get a license to counterfeit money is a capitalist, then I agree &quot;capitalism&quot; is bad (personally I call it socialism, but that&#39;s just a sound).</p>

<p>And indeed, if a &quot;capitalist&quot; country has a centrally-planned economy, ubiquitous corporate welfare, lobbyists in every corner of government, a plethoric military-industrial complex, negative interest rates, more regulation than anywhere in the world, the most undecipherable laws in human history, and is ruled in secrecy by an unaccountable oligarchy, then &quot;capitalism&quot; is bad. But then it has nothing to do with economic freedom.</p>

<p>But I’ll agree with you on this: liberty leads to prosperity, prosperity produces complacency, and complacency causes tyranny. I’m not sure how to avoid this vicious cycle. Perhaps strong spiritual grounding, and placing <em>morality</em> always ahead of <em>utility</em>?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Capitalism (or as you insist on calling it, the &quot;free&quot; market) necessarily means the big bad bankers can and will do what they do.  There isn&#39;t a &quot;good capitalism&quot; where everything is sunshine and roses, and there never was.  You don&#39;t need Marx to tell you that, nor was Marx the only social critic who pointed out the problems of the market system and political economy.</p>

<p>An ideological commitment to the market is a recent, newfangled thing, that specifically came to being as a reaction to Marxism and the socialists.  I don&#39;t know why people are religious believers in the market, or prosperity gospel, or similar nonsense, but the meme is strong despite how easy it is to demonstrate the stupidity of the market.  It&#39;s a goddamn cargo cult.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Seriously, people are so damn illiterate about what exactly happened in the late 19th and 20th centuries.  Capitalism essentially failed in the 1920s and 1930s - that it would end with state-capitalism was an inevitability, and that central banks would have the power they have today is an inevitability.  Short of abolishing capitalism outright, there is no way you retain capitalism and not have something like the Fed appear, and the state pouring huge amounts of money, resources, R&amp;D, etc. for the corporations&#39; profit is the backbone of the current economic regime.</p>

<p>People can and have to make their own choices.  This is true.  However, those choices are <em>heavily</em> influenced by the world around you; by your peers and by what the MSM tells you is and is not “socially acceptable”.  A good portion if not the majority of <em>your own life</em> and the decisions you’ve made in it are influenced and a result of what the MSM and your significant others told you to do and not to do.  This is the case whether you realize it or not.</p>

<p>It’s the case for all of us.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Is it a politicians fault people hang on to, and believe every word/lie they speak? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>In part at least? Absolutely.  Certainly not completely.  Again, people have to use their own noggin for sure.  However, what I just said above here absolutely applies and cannot be underestimated.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I place the blame on the uninformed citizen who picks a political team and follows them blindly, like a fan of a sports team.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You are putting far too much weight on one thing when the fact of the matter is that the reality is a result of multiple influences.  Again, the individual is not completely faultless.  Of course not.  Gotta make your own choices - absolutely.  However, the surrounding environment has a great deal to do with what you chose and why you chose it.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Anytime I’ve made a comment about both political sides being out to fuck the public on behalf of business or the wealthy, I’m the asshole.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That’s because many individuals are still unfortunately brainwashed by TPTB and the controlled MSM.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Does that make me to blame for the country’s problems?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Nobody’s saying it does.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Will you be to blame because nobody listens to you when you point out the obvious?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Nobody’s saying that is or should ever be the case.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The people are to blame for allowing this to snowball.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes.  In the ultimate sense, you are right.  I don’t disagree with this.  However, I also see why it is individuals do certain things that perhaps are not in their ultimate best interest.</p>

<p>Things are complicated.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I understand that CNBC, CNN, Fox News, are all entertainment and not journalistic news outlets.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Unfortunately, a lot of people don’t seem to understand that fact - and ultimately they can’t be entirely blamed because these fake news outlets have dressed themselves in the faux cloth of “actual real news”.  They’ve convinced the nation that they should be trusted with bringing truth to the masses.  It’s a two way street really.  It’s good to wake up.  Yes.  Of course.  However, I can also see how and why various people are still unfortunately very much asleep.</p>

<p>The big influencers of this civilization have put many to sleep.  That is what TPTB have done, and their ubiquitous influence is not easy for many to easily shake off.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I don’t think it’s the media’s fault that people buy into their entertainment like it’s news</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That’s like saying you don’t think it’s the dealer’s fault that so many people get hooked on crap substances.  On one level, yeah.  You’re totally right.  I wouldn’t disagree with that in the least.  On another level, however, it’s foolish for anyone to think that there aren’t any influences or reasons outside of their own efforts that cause people to fall asunder.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>it’s like blaming The Onion if someone is stupid enough to believe one of their articles.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That’s not really a valid analogy.  The Onion is <em>advertised</em> as being a funny parody of news and I don’t know anyone who <em>doesn’t</em> know this fact.</p>

<p>What would happen if The Onion not only presented itself as being 100% entirely genuine and truthful, but it also got a massive, multi-billion dollar industry behind it that pushed it as being 100% entirely genuine as well?  What if the entire MSM machine got behind The Onion and pushed it as real news for decades and decades?  What would happen then?  What would happen is that after about a generation or two, the public wouldn’t even question whether The Onion is actual, real news or not.  It would simply be taken as an absolute matter of fact by many that The Onion <em>is</em> real, authentic news - <em>is</em> the way things really are.</p>

<p>There might be a few people that come out and say “What the fuck, people?  Seriously?  This shit is FAKE!  Y’all don’t understand we’re being fed super fake news?”</p>

<p>And a few others might wake up and realize that it is in fact fake news…but the vast majority will continue to follow along like they had been and keep believing The Onion.  Why?  Because they’ve simply been indoctrinated to believe The Onion is all true.</p>

<p>Things are, again, complicated.</p>

This is the USA, where it is up to you what life you lead, no one else&#39;s. Stop whining about it.</p>

My brother in law did that exact same thing. Worked there for a year, trying to figure out what he wanted to do with his life. After a year of partying, working for shit pay, he decided what the wanted to do and gave it a shot. Everyone lives off of ramen and hot dogs at some point in their life.

<p>You don’t want to have the luxury conversation but you know what?  It’s probably the problem for 75% of the people who complain about not having enough money.

    <div class="md"><p>I had some over the weekend; it’s delicious. But, I also have paid off my grad school loan, bought my house and car, saved for retirement and my kids’ education by sacrificing a shitload throughout my 20s to get here from absolutely nothing in a state that didn’t subsidize shit for education. I worked full time and sometimes also worked as a barback between semesters. </p>

<p>It’s the victim mentality where people say they aren’t being treated fairly and “deserve” more but aren’t willing to give more that put the current asshole in the White House.  The Occupy jackholes camping out and destroying the city parks, doing drugs and shitting all over in the name of “protest” made Middle America voters think, “Yeah, those libs are screwing up my nice town.  Why do I work hard so they can fuck it up? The crazy idiot who makes promises he can’t keep sounds like a much better idea!”  Now look where we are.</p>

<p>The equation is simple:  if you’re putting more into something than you’re getting out of it, you need to move on and find something different.  I moved 2 states away to find an opportunity so don’t tell me it can’t be done.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree with you. But why wait for the government to make this illegal? With the current state of affairs you can probably wait untill hell freezes over. What Disney and a dozens of others companies are doing is immoral. If you agree with the above statements, simply boycott everything Disney is involved in. Share this information and  if you convince a person and he/she convinces another person and that trend continuous on a daily basis, Disney would be forced within a week  to change this policy if they don&#39;t want to go bankrupt.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t agree with the attitude, one that is quite pervasive, that we the people need to wait untill government acts upon social problems. Dictate what&#39;s illegal. Use common sense, evaluete your norms and standards and vote with your pocket. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Cinderella doesn’t go to school, and thinks that she deserves more than minimum wage because she stays with the same employer for too many years and doesn’t have any other transferable skills or has she worked to better herself with her own company to get promoted?  Meanwhile, the CEO is out purchasing Pixar, Marvel, Lucas, and Fox, building a new theme park in Shanghai, and developing new strategies to keep ESPN and the movie studios relevant while combating Netflix and Amazon.  </p>

<p>Disneyland isn’t the only or even the best  employer in Orange County or even Southern California.  Why does Cinderella expect to get more when she doesn’t give more?  Also, why is she so upset with Disney when she is working under a union agreement that didn’t negotiate a better deal for her?</p>

<p>That being said, I believe Disney should choose to pay their people more in order to be THE employer of choice in Orange County.  </p>

<p>May I remind you that those underpaid employees do all of the work, without them, CEO wouldn&#39;t be able to do anything. They create wealth, not the higher management. CEO is not a vital position, there are profitable companies that operate efficiently without CEO taking unnecessary risks and getting overpaid for that. </p>

<p>OP i hope this is either not you or your real name.</p>

<p>Anyway, the real reason why the wages in the &quot;western world/ &quot;developed&quot; world&quot; are taking a dive is because the fucknut owners of said countries decided they want to make people in NA and Europe ready to compete with Chinese labor.</p>

<p>But the stupid part is, you can&#39;t compete with Chinese slave- and childlabor in a legal way, but they found a solution and that is...</p>

<p>...to make people poor enough so they cant rebel against the over-powered police states and take about any, progressively shittier becoming jobs just to make ends meet. The US. lower class can&#39;t get it&#39;s ass out of the slump it&#39;s currently in and that&#39;s by design.</p>

<p>Meanwhile big corps are selectively maximizing revenue e.g. costumers buy overall less but individually more expensive products to compensate for all the lost costumers due to overall higher prices and declining quality.</p>

<p>Simple equation: Instead of selling 10x bread for 1$ each, you just sell 9x bread for 1.10$ each...or even more to keep shareholders happy...</p>

<p>In the food industry products are getting &quot;stretched&quot; using more of less expensive components e.g. more sugar in your apple juice instead of fruit concentrate/&quot;syrup&quot;.</p>

<p>This system is sustainable until the last costumer bails on the too expensive products and services. I&#39;m waiting for the day when the Swiss Nestle Nazis sell you bottled air, because they ran out of water.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>Disneyland is a perfect model of all the entangled orders of simulation. To begin with it is a play of illusions and phantasms: pirates, the frontier, future world, etc. This imaginary world is supposed to be what makes the operation successful. But, what draws the crowds is undoubtedly much more the social microcosm, the miniaturized and religious revelling in real America, in its delights and drawbacks. You park outside, queue up inside, and are totally abandoned at the exit. In this imaginary world the only phantasmagoria is in the inherent warmth and affection of the crowd, and in that aufficiently excessive number of gadgets used there to specifically maintain the multitudinous affect. The contrast with the absolute solitude of the parking lot - a veritable concentration camp - is total. Or rather: inside, a whole range of gadgets magnetize the crowd into direct flows; outside, solitude is directed onto a single gadget: the automobile. By an extraordinary coincidence (one that undoubtedly belongs to the peculiar enchantment of this universe), this deep-frozen infantile world happens to have been conceived and realized by a man who is 1himself now cryogenized; Walt Disney, who awaits his resurrection at minus 180 degrees centigrade.</p>

<p>The objective profile of the United States, then, may be traced throughout Disneyland, even down to the morphology of individuals and the crowd. All its values are exalted here, in miniature and comic-strip form. Embalmed and pactfied. Whence the possibility of an ideological analysis of Disneyland (L. Marin does it well in <em>Utopies, jeux d&#39;espaces</em>): digest of the American way of life, panegyric to American values, idealized transposition of a contradictory reality. To be sure. But this conceals something else, and that &quot;ideological&quot; blanket exactly serves to cover over a third-order simulation: Disneyland is there to conceal the fact that it is the &quot;real&quot; country, all of &quot;real&quot; America, which is Disneyland (just as prisons are there to conceal the fact that it is the social in its entirety, in its banal omnipresence, which is carceral). Disneyland is presented as imaginary in order to make us believe that the rest is real, when in fact all of Los Angeles and the America surrounding it are no longer real, but of the order of the hyperreal and of simulation. It is no longer a question of a false representation of reality (ideology), but of concealing the fact that the real is no longer real, and thus of saving the reality principle.</p>

<p>The Disneyland imaginary is neither true nor false: it is a deterrence machine set up in order to rejuvenate in reverse the fiction of the real. Whence the debility, the infantile degeneration of this imaginary. It&#39;s meant to be an infantile world, in order to make us believe that the adults are elsewhere, in the &quot;real&quot; world, and to conceal the fact that real childishness is everywhere, particularly among those adults who go there to act the child in order to foster illusions of their real childishness.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Two years ago I bought a brand new home for $400k in Northern California.</p>

<p>4 bed, 3 bath</p>

<p>Small neighborhood with a couple stores and a homeless problem.</p>

<p>Average crime rates.</p>

<p>Local elementary school is 50% refugees that cannot speak English and require additional resources.</p>

<p>More than 50% of the student body is on food stamps.</p>

<p>We sold the house. Broke even or maybe lost a little money. I don&#39;t give a fuck. 2k a month mortgage and insurance for such a shit neighborhood was too much.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not much alone.  </p>

<p>Housing within 30 minutes of Google Bus Driver&#39;s job is rough.  $750/mo for a room in a house, minimum, outside weird circumstances (live-in aide, yardwork, etc).  A studio in SF or Silicon Valley is waaaaaay outside Google Bus Driver reach unless s/he has rent control (and therefore has been in place prior to getting Google Bus Driver job).</p>

<p>Heck, Google Bus Driver might be able to swing a studio, but no landlord will rent to him/her.</p>
