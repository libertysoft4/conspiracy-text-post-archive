        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p><a href="https://youtu.be/BbP8OD_RWvA">Here is a quick video summary, on recognizing Bias</a></p>

<p>I am wriiting this from my phone to I apologize in advance for the slow updates. Please see disclaimer at the bottom</p>

<p><a href="https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/bias">Cambridge English Dictionary</a>definition of <strong>Bias</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>1.a [ C usually singular, U ]  <strong>the action of supporting or 
opposing a particular person or thing in an unfair way, because of allowing personal opinions to influence our judgment</strong>: The senator has accused the media of bias.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Ex: Reporters must be impartial and not showpolitical bias.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>1.b <strong>Unconscious bias (= that the person with the bias is not aware of) can influencedecisions in recruitment, promotion, andperformance management.</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<h1>New Rule Proposition:</h1>

<blockquote>
<p>I propose that when submitting a link, or an image graphic that in your submission statement you must state the bias of your source. Text post are optional. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Ex: source Bias: Gov. (Insert here), political belief it leans towards or in favours, science, not applicable= ( meaning that it presents evidence in unbiased manner, it allows you to form your own opinion and does not tell you what to believe etc.) (Let me know if you have a better def. for the NA)</p>

<h1>Why?</h1>

<blockquote>
<p>I believe that we should state which bias is shown in our links/images, so that we can establish facts and evidence from opinions, articles telling us what we should believe,  sensationalistic news, propaganda, and disinformation. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Feel free to let me know your thoughts and opinions on this.  Let me know the pros, and cons and other things I should add.</p>

<p>There has been an increase in Russian disinformation spies, and misinformation active on the internet within the past 24 hours. </p>

<h1>Please be on the look out from any articles from from the following:</h1>

<p>🔷️RT, and any news sources owned by the Russian government.  Russia is one of the most dangerous places in the world for journalists. </p>

<p>🔷️CNN: Presents heavy left, far left leaning bias stories, fear mongering, Sensationalistic news stories, and propaganda.</p>

<p>🔷️Fox News and News station owned by Sinclair Broadcasting: Presents heavy far-right, and center right bias, propaganda, multiple false news stories, disinformation, fear mongering, and slanderous attacks.</p>

<p>🔷️ShareBlue: Heavy left leaning  biases, Owned by Clinton Foundation, propaganda, slanderous attacks, disinformation.</p>

<p>🔷️Gateway Pundit:heavy far-right bias, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Gateway_Pundit">sued multiple times for producing fake news stories</a>, propaganda, disinformation, slanderous attacks, founded in 2004 by Jim Hoft.</p>

<p>🔷️LyingComey.com: literal propaganda paid for by the RNC to discredit the ex-FBI leader Comey. Heavy right-wing bias, active disinformation campaign,   slanderous attacks.</p>

<p>🔷️Current US White House press briefings. White house has been caught lying multiple times, denying facts, and (my personal opinion) a giant shit show.</p>

<p>🔷️Alex Jones: heavy right-wing bias, propaganda, disinformation, slanderous attacks, fear mongering, sensationalistic news, known to report false names of attackers, and victims.</p>

<p>Let me know of other popular news sources that present a strong bias, prone to disinformation etc. and what they are known for.  </p>

<p>If you are upset by the list I provided, this wonderful  <a href="http://theoatmeal.com/comics/believe">comic</a>will help hopefully help you understand my perspective better. </p>

<h1>Disclaimer:</h1>

<p>I am from Canada, and I am a centrist, I will always refuse to choose a side. What I care about is the truth, based of off scientific facts, evidence, and respectable discussion. I could careless what your theory or idea is, as long as the sources are reliable, facts based, and unbiased as possible.</p>

<p><strong>This post is for those who are NOT disinformation spies, and to help rest of us identify misinformation, propaganda, and flat out lies. It seems that this sub clearly has an epidemic issue with bias. Believing their opinions to be facts, and evidence.</strong></p>

<p>I think it will help improve discussion if one can recognize bias, it will help them recognize facts from opinions, and allow them to determine their own view points. It also promote self reflective critical thinking skills.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Thank you for clarifying. I am not asking the person to defend the source, no where did I state that.What I want is for them to state what bias there source presents. </p>

<p>For example:</p>

<p>There are already muliptle RT news articles in new, RT is owned by the Russian Gov. and used as a propaganda machine to control it&#39;s country. Asking them to state the bias of the article is to make them think critically about what the are reading, and inform us as well. All I want is for them to state the biase/ viewpoint of the article or image. I do not care what the conspiracy is as long as it has relaible sources, one of the ways to tell that is to determine the level bias the source has. It is not the ideology, theory, or belief  that I care about, but how it is presented. </p>

<p>What do you mean by policing the potential bias of the content?</p>

<p>Conspiracy is a place to share conspiracy and discussion. What I want is for  people, as the should, to think critically about the sources of their conspiracy. So we do not fall victime to false information and propaganda.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Can you explain this more? 
What rule will be violated? </p>

<p>Does that help clarify?</p>

<p>That is clearly not the case. As you can see they is still a lot of people who do not have the skills to think critically about the stuff they are reading. Thus fall victim to propaganda, and disinformation. </p>

<p>No shit of course it is dangerous. I am not suggesting we heard like minded people together, I am asking for them to 5hink critically about their article and tell us what it&#39;s viewpoint/bias is.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>I am aware that the are bias news sources. The list is for sources known for spreading disinformation, sensationalist news, propaganda etc. That tell you what to think, and who to blame.  At the moment there is a huge push to spread misinformation, false accusations, and distraction news. From the Syria Air Strike. I listed the ones I believe are the most susceptible to the stuff I listed above. Feel free to provide me with more left leaning bias sources that are prone to those characteristics.</p>

<p>Those two news organizations do hold left leaning bias but do not let it affect how they report the news. For example New York Times piece on Harvey Weinstein. That is actual reporting. Many of the  news reporters belgoning to those news organizations have gotten killed from actually going out to get evidence for their reports. </p>

<p>I do not claim this to mine.  I am claim it to be ours. It is a community and communities work together. &quot;Your&quot; is a possessive descriptor(i.e that is <em>your</em> bike.), thus this is your sub as much as it is mine. This is not about me but us, thus I unconsciously did not use I personal possesives (like mine).</p>

<p>So I ask you this- what are <em>your</em> biases in posting this? And yes, I am fully aware of your claim towards being a &quot;centrist&quot;, whatever that means. </p>

<p>I stated it in the disclaimer, on why I made this post, but I am happy to expand on it. My bias in posting this is that I am fucking fed up with the half-ass bullshit source being useed. The ones that clearly have a strong bias, and is used to spread disinformation and lies. Posts like Q and shit that are not based on reason, or actual logic. That abuse people who lack the reasoning skills to self reflect critically, that are prone to paranoia and delusions. News that has caused people to be so far removed from reality. My goal is that this will force people to think critically about what they are reading.</p>
