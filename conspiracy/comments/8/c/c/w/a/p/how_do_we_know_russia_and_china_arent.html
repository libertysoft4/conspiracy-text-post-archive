<p>I engaged some guy who believes the same shit that you do about black nobility and the Holy Roman Empire controlling the world.

<p>Giving me a list of names and yelling to me that these families control the world does not suffice as an explanation for what is going on. </p>

<p>You have yet to explain in your own words what the interests of the Holy Roman Empire are and how that ties in with current events. You just direct me to other sources and claim you left a trail of breadcrumbs oh please. </p>

<p>Also I want you to see the thread of the conversation I had with this guy who believes in the black nobility stuff because he wasn’t able to answer my questions, and it was clear that I won the exchange </p>

<p>Huh? I call them all out, whether it&#39;s Black Nobility or Khazar Hofjuden. Also, they don&#39;t practice &quot;satanism&quot;. It&#39;s Luciferianism (based on Babylonian/Sumerian Mysticism).

    <div class="md"><p>The answer to your question is yes, they do control both Russia and China. u/Awesomo3082 makes a good point that Russia was overtaken during the Bolshevik revolution and there is no indication that they won their country back. All you have to do is read the work of Antony Sutton, especially <a href="https://www.voltairenet.org/IMG/pdf/Sutton_Wall_Street_and_the_bolshevik_revolution-5.pdf">Wall Street and the Bolshevik Revolution</a> to get a sense of that. I also recommend reading Miles Mathis&#39;s research on <a href="http://mileswmathis.com/lenin.pdf">Lenin and the Russian revolution.</a> What he shows there is not only that Lenin was (crypto) Jewish, but also that Nicolas II was, indicating that the revolution was managed on both sides, which makes sense given that it was a quick and bloodless revolution. </p>

<p>Now, as for China, they were conquered over the 19th century during the Opium wars, with the Boxer rebellion probably marking the coup de grace of their conquest. See the discussion of the Boxer rebellion on page 15 in <a href="http://mileswmathis.com/butler2.pdf">this paper I wrote on Smedley Butler</a> for a discussion of some the fingerprints of Zionist/Jewish influence and interference. <a href="https://wideawakegentile.wordpress.com/2013/12/18/jews-in-china-mao-era/">Here is a link with even more.</a> And then of course there is <a href="http://www.mygen.com/users/ufo/Mao_was_a_Yale_Man.html">all the evidence</a> that Mao was supported and installed by the OSS.  </p>

<p>By the way, the leaders of Middle Eastern countries were installed by the colonial powers in the early 20th century, and there is really no indication of a real change of power. That is true even in Iran if you look carefully. So the same that can be said of Russia and China can be said of the Middle East and frankly of the rest of the world. All of this Russia hysteria is just misdirection. All sides are controlled by the same powers. We are already living in a One World Government, but it doesn&#39;t look like what we were lead to believe it would look like. Again, classic misdirection. </p>

Russia and Israeli trade has gone up 30% in recent years and a lot of dual nationalist Russian citizens work in the high tech sector in Israel.</p>

<p>Also Israel has a good business relationship with China as well. They sell America’s most valuable weapons technology to China like the F-35. Trump even gave a speech recently condemning China for stealing our high technology, but of course he didn’t mention that Israel sold it to them. </p>

<p>I wouldn’t be surprised at all, but I still have hope that Putin is a Russian nationalist that isn’t controlled by a ZOG </p>
