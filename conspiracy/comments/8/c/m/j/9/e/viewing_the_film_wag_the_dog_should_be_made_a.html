    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>How?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Guidance fins at the rear increase drag and/or angle-of-attack on a particular axis, relative to the fins that stay straight and level. As long as the missile is moving <em>through</em> the air, it can adjust its aspect with the guidance fins. Internal gyroscopes tell the missile which way is “up” so it always knows which fins to move to create the effect it needs to change directional aspect.</p>

<p>If you’re still not convinced, consider a boat crossing a flowing river to the opposite riverbank, with the current pulling it downstream. The rudder (at the rear) allows the boat to orient itself slightly upstream, so that the means of propulsion (the rower, the outboard motor) can counteract the current enough to move straight across.</p>

<p>Gravity is the river pushing downstream. The missile’s fins are the rudder, pointing the nose up. Air is the fluid instead of water. Gyroscopes direct the fins to provide “buoyancy” that keeps the missile upright on the horizontal plane, instead of rotating. The thrust from the missile’s rocket motor acts like the rower’s paddles, or the outboard motor. All the same principles apply.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That question depends on your definition and my definition. Are we talking about the same thing, in general enough terms? I’m using an analogy to explain the principles involved, which I’ve seen tested on scale models that operate just fine at a similar scale of claimed real-life missile performance. The scaling fits.</p>

<p>Is there any generalised description where you can accept that A is similar enough to B to be a representative model? Or is the objective to nitpick the definitions until the two things inevitably appear non-equivocal, when examined closely?</p>

<p>I could do that with any two apparently similar things too, if I drilled down far enough. But that is t the point I’m making. </p>

<p>The general concept of how guidance fins work applies to a scale model, so why would the same concept <em>not</em> apply to a full-scale guided middle? Of course there will be differences in capabilities, in material strength and weight, in reliability, and in cost, but the fundamental design principles are the same for both.</p>

<p>The other reply to this comment explains guidance fins. Some missiles use thrust vectoring, too.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>On what do you base this claim?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Stick your hand out the window of a car while driving down the road. Angle it up and down and feel how the air applies force to it. The car is providing the &quot;thrust&quot;. You could try this holding a brick or block of wood out of the window (just don&#39;t drop it).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, I think most people who come here distrust the media and establishment.</p>

<p>You using this as an excuse to shill the same video that you made
over and overnight again is another matter.</p>

<p>Also, your video which shows a blatant lack of understanding of basic physics, engineering or research is just another example of a someone sensationalizing false content to promote their own brand.</p>

<p>You have been explained many times how missile control systems such as vectored thrust, fins, vanes, lifting bodies, thrust tonweight ratio, speed vs surface area required for lift etc... but you ignore those and keep promoting this drivel. </p>

<p>You have been sent videos and explanations and testimony and yet still hawk your poorly conceived video. Even for specific missiles and flight profiles. Your standard of proof would require us to strap you to a missile and you would still deny its existence. Also, since you don’t believe in gravity, what’s the issue?</p>

<p>One might wonder who is engaged in the media fakery here? Small time but fakery for sure? Maybe because you want to promote your subscription based web site? </p>
