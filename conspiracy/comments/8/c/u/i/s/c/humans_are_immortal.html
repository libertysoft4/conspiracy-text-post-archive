We have been led to believe naturally we should live no longer than 120 years but this is not true.</p>

<p>In Friederich Gualdus&#39;s investigation
he points to environment and diet being major factors in longevity
which is mirrored in many cultures and they&#39;re stories of Immortal men. In India they are the Siddhars and Yogis who live in forests and caves. In China there is a long history of Hsien (Immortal Men) and previously sealed coffins being empty on opening.
The Zhongnan Mountains contain stories of Immortal hermits.
Leonard Orr has talked about Immortal men living forests in Iran.

<p>The conclusion Friederich Gualdus comes to in his investigation is that in the proper natural environment with the right diet
the human lifespan can be extended.
His research barely includes all the plants minerals and physical practises from each culture that confer longevity.

&quot;Gilgamesh, I shall reveal a secret thing, it is a mystery of the gods that I am telling you.

<p>&quot; Another legend has it that, a yogi came down to Kanjamalai with his aged discipile with the intention of obtaining eternal youth through yogic practices. He left his disciple in charge of cooking his food, and went out to the rich jungle, in search of medicinal herbs. The devoted disciple, stirred the pot of boiling rice with a stick found nearby and to his horror found the rice turning black. Afraid of serving the blackened rice to his guru, he consumed it himself - and to his utter amazement attained a youthful form.
The guru, convinced of the magical powers of the stick which had been used to stir the rice, searched for it, and to his horror discovered that the disciple had thrown it into the fire. He caused the disciple to vomit out the rice that he had consumed, and consumed it himself and also attained an eternally youthful form &quot;.</p>

<p>There is also the state of incorruptibility which is really the Jeevasamadhi state. Buddhist Taoists Siddhars Catholic saints have all been found in this state.</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incorruptibility">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incorruptibility</a></p>

<p>Jeevasamdhi.
&quot;This state can be done by them either after being enclosed or before enclosure, as they choose and as per the instructions they give totTheir disciples/followers. Stopping the body functions, the Siddha ensures by his spiritual achievement that the life does not go out of the body. This body will never or extremely slowly decay for thousands of years because the magnetic force in the body now acts as the life force (prana) in this body. In this state of suspended animation the breathing and blood circulation completely stops but the pranic forces keep the body cells nourished and alive. Then as invisible forces, They continue guiding mankind towards spiritual upliftment. There is a possibility that the Siddha can dematerialize his body from the tomb and materialize it elsewhere in some different location and carry out the mission for another span of years! &quot;</p>

<p>They are historical precedents for long lifespans and rejuvenation. The Casmisards.
&quot; In the late 1600s, when King Louis XIV tried to purge the 
country of the unabashedly Protestant Huguenots, a group of Huguenot resistors in the valley of the Cevennes and known as the Cami-sards displayed similar abilities. In an official report sent to Rome, one of the persecutors, a prior named Abbe du Chayla, complained that no matter what he did, he could not succeed in harming the Camisards. When he ordered them shot, the musket balls would be found flattened between their clothing and their skin. When he closed their hands upon burning 
coals, they were not harmed, and when he wrapped them head to toe in cotton soaked with oil and set them on fire, they did not burn. &quot;

<p>&quot; Death is not natural; rather it is unnatural.
And death is not from nature; rather it is against nature.&quot;
- Saint Nikolai Velimirovic</p>

<p>A lot of research into Immortality has been done for centuries,
particularly by the Rosicrucian&#39;s. Johann Valentin Andreae&#39;s body was found in tomb preserved in the Jeevasamadhi state. He left books for his Rosicrucian brothers and they guarded his body. 
There are too many historical incidences stories and knowledge handed down regarding 
Immortality to list it all here.
Nearly every major civilisation throughout history contain examples of Immortal men. I hope this post wets your appetite in exploring this subject.</p>

<p>Below are extracts from Revelation of the True Chemical Wisdom by Friederich Gualdus detailing his research.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.rexresearch.com/alchemy3/gualdus.htm">http://www.rexresearch.com/alchemy3/gualdus.htm</a></p>

<p>&quot; God fixed it at 120 ordinary years after the Fall. Nevertheless, Arphaxad, who was born 200 years after the Flood, lived for 300 years and his son Salem for 430. Heber, a son of Salem’s from whom the Hebrews have their name, lived for 465 years.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot; Relating to secular history, Homer informs us that Prince Nestor, son of Neli, was nearly 300 years old when he came to the aid of the Greeks against the Trojans. Anacreon assures us that Arganthemius, king of the Tartessos was 150 years; Cinirus, king of Cyprus, lived to 100 years; and Aeginius, to 200 years. Petrus Maffeus, in his Indian history, testified that in Bengal an ordinary an was found, who had neither science nor erudition, who was 355 years old, and as proof thereof he related everything from memory that had happened in his lifetime, and which was quite in accord with the chronicles.</p>

<p>The great Seneca, a Spaniard by birth, reached 44 years of age and would without doubt have become much older if his cruel and unjust disciple Nero had not cut the thread of his life. Under the Emperor Trajan, Simon Cleophe, Bishop of Jerusalem, was crucified at the age of 120 years old; St Anthony, Bishop of Egypt was 150; and Cronius, his collaborator, 155. Emperor Claudius, after sufficiently examining the age of the Bolognese Titus Fullonius, finally found that he had been 150 years old. The Hun King Attila died in the 124th year of his life. Petrus de Natalibus asserts that St Severinus, Bishop of Tongres, reached 375 years of age and was ordained Bishop in his 197th year. Nicolaus de Comitatibus certifies that among the Bracmanniers there had been one of 300 years.</p>

<p>It is also easy for Nature to give to one man alone so many years as she might otherwise gives to many together, just as she bestows on a giant so much strength and matter as would at other times be required for the formation of many human bodies. Such a one was a man of the lineage of Turgan, not far from Lake Constance, who fought against the Saxons under Charlemagne. He impaled eight of them on his pike, carried them over his shoulder and walked through the Rhine with them to his comrades, saying: Look here the German frogs that I have caught; I cannot understand their croaking.</p>

<p>Guido Bonatus assures us that in 1223 he knew someone by the name of Richard, who was already 400 years old and could undeniably prove that he had seen service under Charlemagne. In addition, there is also much talk about a certain Jean du Temps who served in the war under Charlemagne and died under Louis VII in the year 1146. From this we may conclude that he must have lived close to 360 years, as Charlemagne had already been crowned Emperor in the year 800.</p>

<p>A certain Englishman was 152 years old, And just as I do not report anything without good reason, I also say here that the learned Monsieur Hubin, Royal French Treasurer, had given me that man’s portrait, which he had received from M. Jacques du Perron, nephew of the Cardinal of the same name, Bishop of Angouleme and subsequently Euvreux, where he died as Chief Almoner of the daughter of the King of England, Henry IV.</p>

<p>That Englishman was rather tall and heavy, and his name was Thomas Parck, of Winningthon, parish of Alverburg, County of Shropshire. He was born in 1433 and had already 152 years when he was put before King Charles I in England on 9 October 1635. He had seen nine Kings on the English throne: Edward IV, Richard III, Henry VII, Henry VIII, Elizabeth, James VI, and Charles I, father of the present ruling King. The good man praised God among other things also for the fact that he had always steadfastly adhered to the Roman Catholic religion, although he had seen three changes in religion during his lifetime, under Henry VIII, Queen Mary Tudor, and then again under Elizabeth. He readily confessed that he had been put on trial in his 100th year because he had got a young girl with child. This was also the reason why, after the customs of the country, he had to stand in front of the church door, covered with a white cloth and holding a wax candle in his hand, thus obviously doing penance. Sixteen years before his death he lost his sight. He died in London on 24 November 1635, within half an hour, without having been sich before or noticing the approaching death. After his death, his body was opened and all his inner parts were found to be healthy, except his lung which was full of hardened blood. The physicians attributed this to a change of air, as he had been brought to his place of death from a locality where the air had been much purer and milder than in London.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot; Now we will also show which things that are outside of us and how many of them, such as the place of residence, purity of the air and water, etc., contribute to the preservation of health and the prolongation of life. It is rightly said that the dead are the best teachers because they teach us in their works without flattery and self-interest, as the following epitaph informs us in regard to longevity: Continence and Frugality Prolong Our Lifespan,</p>

<p>The great Pythagorean Appolonius of Tyana retained his youth for over 100 years by his continence and frugality, which also caused the ancient anchorites to extend their lifespan and health so far. Due precisely to continence and frugality, the great philosopher Democritus also enjoyed the best health for 109 years. And it is worth remembering what  Diogenes Laertius thinks of his death: His sister having indicated that she could not attend the festivities of the goddess Ceres if he died before them, he complied and sustained himself during his last three days of life with the smell of warm bread. The true celibate and chaste state is indeed an excellent means for living long and healthy.</p>

<p>But Artaxerxes, King of Persia, who begot 115 children, ended his life only after 100 years, due solely to the conspiration of fifty of his children. The Roman Emperor Proclus once boasted that a hundred Polish girls had given birth to 100 of his children within two weeks.</p>

<p>In such a way, at the time of St Jerome, a Roman man could have had a legion of legitimate children with a Roman lady, according toe an account of this Church Father who lived at the time of Pope Damasu. In Rome there lived a man who had already become a widower twenty times. He had married a widow who, in turn, had already 20 husbands. When she died, he attended the corpse with a laurel wreath on his head and a palm branch in his hand, under the great cheers of other men, which they uttered because he had survived his otherwise incomparable wife.</p>

<p>Moderation and physical exercise also make us healthy and strong. This is why the Romans were extremely amazed at the strength and giant size of our Gauls, who did not drink wine and for a long time knew nothing about it, until the Swiss Helicon first brought the vine and its juice to Gaul. Likewise, the kind of food we eat contributes a great deal to a long life. People in the Province of Limoges mostly eat nothing but chestnuts and live for a very long time, because they get from them nourishment that is little subject to corruption and thus does not easily dissipate.</p>

<p>A good constitution and the right temperature of the radical moisture and the natural warmth are necessary for a long life. The superfluous moisture tones the warmth down; and frequent warmth in turn tones down the moisture. That is why a long life can be expected of a sanguine constitution, as the blood is then warm and moist. The aggressive and ever active fire of the choleric constitution cannot last long in a dry person. The great moisture of the phlegmatic cannot sufficiently cook the natural warmth; and the melancholic is all too dry and cold. But it may well be that when the choleric and the phlegmatic constitutions are combined, and one tempers the other’s faults, they make for a long life. This also happens with the sanguine and melancholic, when the warmth and moisture of the blood is tempered by the dryness of the melancholic and can likewise give a long life.</p>

<p>In addition, a healthy place of residence contributes not a little to a long life. When Emperor Vespasian and his son Titus had a census made of all of Italy, four men were found in a town of Vellajacum, region of Piacenza, who were each 210 years old, and still six other men each 110 years. At the same time, there lived in Arimini a woman by name of Tertulla who was 137 years old. Likewise another in Faventia in her 132nd year. Pliny relates from the Isigon that in India the Cirneses generally live to 140 years. Pomponius Mela reports that the residents of a town situated at the foot of Mount Atlas live twice as long as other inhabitants of the globe. And Orisicrates asserts that there are Indians in the tropics who are as tall as five elbows and live to 130 without debilitating old age. Ctesias likewise avers that those who lived in Pandoria in the valleys generally reached 200 years, and they had this odd characteristic that they had white and grey hair in their youth but black hair in old age.</p>

<p>Helanicus writes that in the region of Etolia the inhabitants usually became 200 years old. Among them, Pictoreus reached 300 years, according to a report by Damasus. If Ephorus is to be believed, the Arcadian King lived for 300 years. And Alexander Cornelius says that in Illyria a certain Dandon extended his life to 500 years. But in his Periplus Xenophon goes even further, saying that the Maritime King lived for 600 years and his son for 800.</p>

<p>Olaus Magnus writes in the 4th book of his Histories that the people of the coldest midnight countries usually live to 160 years of age; and in his 12th book he says that the inhabitants of Iceland reach more than 100 years.</p>

<p>In his Historia Naturali, Nierembergius asserts that the people living in the Jucantic mountains became quite old. And in the region of Versin in Brazil, as is testified to by Antonius Pipafelta, people very often reach 140 years. According to a report by Ludovic Bartama the age of 100 years is quite common in blessed Arabia.</p>

<p>In the Auvergne it often happens that fathers see the children of their grandchildren, and I have read somewhere that in our Alps a single man was the head and progenitor of a whole village which had more than a hundred households, all stemmed from him. Finally, in the year 1660 traveled from Ternant towards Orange, together with the Marquis of St Andre Montbrun, Captain General of the Royal Army, because of some affairs concerning the Count de Dona, and I went to an inn at Allieres, a few hours from Lyons. It so happened that our host and hostess, both healthy and full of vigor, had each in fact lived for 104 years.</p>

<p>In the previous discourse I have sufficiently shown by examples from the ecclesiastical and temporal history that there have at all times of the world been persons who lived for several hundred years. From this is it very easy to conclude that it is not impossible for us to live just a s long as they did, and that the story of Friedericus Gualdus, who was 400 years old, is no fiction. About this, I will now also bring here a literal extract from the Dutch newspaper of April 3, 1687.</p>

<p>Extract from a Letter from Venice of March 7, 1688: &quot;Three months ago, a man by the name of Frederico Gualdo left here, who is 400 years old. He carried with him his portrait which had been made by Titian, already dead for 130 years! From this we may conclude that this man has had the true Universal Medicine, whereby he was able to keep himself healthy for such a long time. This is no fiction, however, but there are here many credible witnesses who spoke with this man himself, and who left here for no other reason that that it was said of him that he possessed the true secret of the Universal Medicine. The lovers of great curiosities will investigate this matter and inform us of the result, so that we can thereby also be useful to the public.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If we were immortal it wouldn&#39;t take very long for us to finally become bored with our unending days and tired of simply being the same person we have always been. </p>

<p>The natural stages of life are such that as we age we no longer feel as attached or afraid of finally laying this physical burden down and for those who believe in reincarnation that there&#39;s certainly some evidence to suggest, there may in fact be another and completely different trip coming up after it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Afterlife, reincarnation and some many others believe are pretty interesting.</p>

<p>But it&#39;s that being immortal would be boring when you have to live the exact same way until the end of the existence, these 100 year&#39;s look like a short time for a lot of people but honestly if you think about is really a long time</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You can&#39;t escape being yourself nor really change much when it comes to your private likes and dislikes and with an unlimited amount of time you would eventually exhaust and become bored with all the things you liked the best and always found most enjoyable to do and nothing else that quite measured up to it. </p>

<p>In a situation like that I don&#39;t think it would be very long before people would be looking to have their memories wiped or their personality re-programmed to restore their interest and expand the variety of things they could enjoy or else enjoy again without remembering that they already had to such an extent that they weren&#39;t pleasurable any more. </p>

<p>You know, they may call it old age but it&#39;s still an entirely new experience with all kinds of unexpected challenges that never presented any kind of problems in our youth.</p>

<p>You don&#39;t really or fully begin to fully appreciate that youth until you reach that stage not that there&#39;s actually a whole lot that you&#39;d want to ever do over or any differently when it comes to it but rather the new perspective that being older and little wiser has on how you remember it and suddenly see all the things you simply took for granted when you were in your prime as they say.</p>

<p>Wisdom comes too late, but better late than never. There are all those we loved and deeply cared about who have gone before us and a growing sense that we belong to and with them or that the time is approaching to finally &quot;go home&quot; to the source of that feeling.</p>

<p>There will be a time when we decide to dive into life to try our best and learn from it.</p>

<p>This is a limit that is even set in the Bible, which i find very interesting, because this limit was set after the big flood as a punishment for humanity&#39;s wickedness of the past. Before the flood, people lived ~1000 years.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It never tried to be. How come the 120 years haven&#39;t been broken yet by a significant margin? How do you explain <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/science/2016/10/05/humans-unlikely-to-ever-live-longer-than-125-years-scientists-cl/">this?</a> The only way to bypass this biological limit is by playing God and  designing our babies, of which there are also numerous warnings against it in the Bible (Example: Corinthians 3:16-17). It is also stated that God made man in his own image, but with limitations. Can it be proven? Nope. Can it be disproved? Also nope. Believe what you want, but if you want to counter with arguments like &quot;lul it&#39;s the Bible&quot; we all know where you&#39;ll go after you die, but maybe I&#39;m wrong, who knows.</p>
