        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>10 years ago, if you said Neanderthals interbred with humans, you&#39;d be dismissed as a conspiracy theorist.</p>

<p>This was despite the fact there were fossils clearly showing hybrid traits.</p>

<p>This was also despite people in isolated regions claiming they had neanderthal features such as a sloping forehead. The academia would politely dismiss these people as being inbred and not neanderthal at all.</p>

<p>Of course genetic DNA testing proved these academics as being totally wrong. Why did the academics initially dismiss the hypothesis and ignore all the supporting information?</p>

<p>The researcher who I first read on the Neanderthal hypothesis was a Ashkenazi Jew. He claimed he got beaten up by other Jews for trying to write a book on it. His explanation why there was such a violent reactions:  Ashkenazi Jews have high Neanderthal DNA content.</p>

<p>If you look at photos of Henri Kissinger, who looks almost 100% Neanderthal, this seems plausible:</p>

<p>Ashkenazi Jews have been shown to descend from Khazaria, a region where there may have been higher Neanderthal interbreeding. They also descend from a small number of individuals.</p>

<p>Do you think Neanderthal  DNA could explain why Israel is so genocidal to the Palestinians? I mean Neandethals would extremely aggressive, and they may regard normal &quot;humans&quot; as being a existential threat.</p>

<p>Last time I checked the literature, the academics were being very selective in the populations they reported Neanderthal DNA %. Since then, has there been any studies on Jewish Neanderthals?</p>

<p>Do we have a source on this? Because Khazaria was in the Northern Caucuses, near modern day Armenia and Southern Russia, and from what I&#39;ve read the greatest intermingling of Neanderthal DNA is thought to be in populations from Southern Europe (France), China, and parts of SE Asia.</p>

<p>I think we gotta be careful here...Jews aren&#39;t more genocidal than any other grouping of humans. Unfortunately, that&#39;s just the human condition. <em>All</em> of us are capable of the utmost degeneracy and violence given the right psychological conditioning. </p>

<p>If you look at Jewish DNA you can see they&#39;re genetically distinct from Europeans. </p>

<p>This is likely due to their inbreeding (marrying a non Jew is frowned up, only the child of a jewish mother is considered jewish), as well as their origin.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know how much neanderthal dna they have. The only study i know of restricted themselves to 5 bizarre populations (papuan new guinea was one).</p>

<blockquote>
<p>James Watson, a Nobel Prize winner for his part in the unravelling of DNA who now runs one of America&#39;s leading scientific research institutions, drew widespread condemnation for comments he made ahead of his arrival in Britain today for a speaking tour at venues including the Science Museum in London.</p>

<p>Critics of Dr Watson said there should be a robust response to his views across the spheres of politics and science. Keith Vaz, the Labour chairman of the Home Affairs Select Committee, said: &quot;It is sad to see a scientist of such achievement making such baseless, unscientific and extremely offensive comments. I am sure the scientific community will roundly reject what appear to be Dr Watson&#39;s personal prejudices.</p>

<p>Quite independent of Arthur Koestler, whose work he had never read, Michael Bradley, a Canadian-based writer of Jewish origin, released his own 1978 work, The Iceman Inheritance, followed up by its sequel, Chosen People From the Caucusus. In both these books, Bradley put forth his thesis that the modern day people known as the Jews were descendants from the Khazars and that, indeed, the Khazars could trace their origins back to the Neanderthals.</p>

<p>Bradley contends that people and cultures emerging from the Caucasus Mountains — a known refuge of late lingering Neanderthal populations — in proto-historical and historical times, would have remained highly intelligent, highly aggressive and psychosexually maladapted, promoting a high level of in-group cohesion. These traits, Bradley contends, explain the survival of Biblical Hebrews against all odds and also the inordinate social influence of modern Western Jews.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Having a measley 3-4% of human DNA that can also be found in the completely extinct Neanderthal&#39;s DNA only demonstrates just how very far apart and  incompatible the two separate species actually are. </p>

<p>The same will be found with any of the other so-called &quot;hominids&quot;, <em>Erectus, Robustus, Australopithecanthropus</em> et al, which were all separate and very different species with no possible connection or relationship to one another. </p>

<p>The gross error that the evolutionary enthusiasts refuse to accept or deal with is that the true nature of genetics is such that the lock-step process that ensures that every member of any species is a completely unique and never to be duplicated individual with an equally unique collection of the general traits, talents, and abilities of that belong to and identify that species, is also a lock-step and fool-proof mechanism that prohibits them from ever being or becoming anything other than a member of that species or displaying any characteristics that don&#39;t already belong to it.</p>

<p>Something that really is far more astounding and miraculous than the limited patterns and building blocks of life in Mother Nature&#39;s toolbox that each of them are independently constructed out of in a wide variety of different ways.</p>

<p>When the conditions of life exceed the range of any species particular talents and abilities that identify and make each of them what they are and their lives are quite simply no longer worth living, they become extinct. </p>

<p>It is not as postulated some struggle to simply &quot;survive&quot; for nature only induces enough stress to promote the normal functioning and a healthy range of actions in any species and between them and any other species. </p>

<p>Look at this way, if your life or that of any other life form was on the line every minute of every day there&#39;d be no will or purpose to it. You&#39;d very quickly shut-down and quit trying in the face of it.</p>

<p>Evolution as it is simplistically stated and promoted is based strictly on scientific materialism that will rationalize and accept any purely physical explanation it can concoct or dream-up, no matter how contradictory or illogical the actual facts surrounding it happen to be.</p>

<p>We routinely speak of individual species &quot;emerging&quot; or &quot;appearing&quot; and that are all perfectly adapted to the envirnorment in which they are found. </p>

<p>That&#39;s the reality and no amount of declaring that they must be related to and have come from some other species owing to certain similarities that only exist thousands of miles away or even on an other continent that they are genetically incompatible with is patently ridiculous. </p>

<p>Clearly the answer lies elsewhere and it is better to have no answer and pursue that issue elsewhere than to accept what is an unreasonable and by and large unprovable one.</p>

<p>Neanderthal Genes in Your DNA Could Be Making You Unhappy and Aggressive</p>

<p>A new study reports that residual Neanderthal DNA in the human genome may make some modern humans insufferable. </p>

<p>The researchers, from the State University of New York at New Paltz and other institutions, relied on something called the Neanderthal quotient, the percentage of DNA that overlaps with Neanderthal DNA. The team compared the Neanderthal quotients of 200 volunteers with their results on several psychological surveys. The results, published in Human Ethology Bulletin, showed that participants with a higher percentage of Neanderthal DNA were more likely to experience social fear, promiscuity, depressive tendencies, bipolar tendencies, and autistic tendencies. They were also less imaginative. </p>

<p>“What it seems like to me is that there are certain dispositions that someone with high Neanderthal DNA may have,” lead author Glenn Geher told Newsweek. “If you’re very Neanderthal in your genome, that plays out in your behaviors.”</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The only revisionist is you, hallucinating that there were no academics denying the Neanderthal human interbreeding. I saw them being interviewed in a documentary.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>ALL human genetic diversity is a subset of African genetic diversity.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>lol so humans didn&#39;t evolve after they left Africa? Sounds like BS.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>No, &quot;race&quot; is a biological concept with a particular definition.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The biological definition of race is a geographically isolated breeding population that shares certain characteristics in higher frequencies than other populations of that species, but has not become reproductively isolated from other populations of the same species.</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p>Explain how being able to cluster humans wasn&#39;t due to geographical/social barriers and how it doesn&#39;t constitute a race.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Are all humans with a Y chromosome one race?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No, just like male lions aren&#39;t a different species to female lions.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The race part, as we covered, is both biological and inapplicable.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Why is it inapplicable?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The IQ part - i.e. the human psychometric construct - is what&#39;s political.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So why can we guess with a high degree of accuracy IQ using brain scans? Is the brain a &quot;social construct&quot; too?</p>

<p>If you look at Jewish DNA you can see they&#39;re genetically distinct from Europeans. </p>

<p>This is likely due to their inbreeding (marrying a non Jew is frowned up, only the child of a jewish mother is considered jewish), as well as their origin.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know how much neanderthal dna they have. The only study i know of restricted themselves to 5 bizarre populations (papuan new guinea was one).</p>

<p>One of the researchers on the study said some populations (not published) had much higher % neanderthal DNA.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>Quite independent of Arthur Koestler, whose work he had never read, Michael Bradley, a Canadian-based writer of Jewish origin, released his own 1978 work, The Iceman Inheritance, followed up by its sequel, Chosen People From the Caucusus. In both these books, Bradley put forth his thesis that the modern day people known as the Jews were descendants from the Khazars and that, indeed, the Khazars could trace their origins back to the Neanderthals.</p>

<p>Bradley contends that people and cultures emerging from the Caucasus Mountains — a known refuge of late lingering Neanderthal populations — in proto-historical and historical times, would have remained highly intelligent, highly aggressive and psychosexually maladapted, promoting a high level of in-group cohesion. These traits, Bradley contends, explain the survival of Biblical Hebrews against all odds and also the inordinate social influence of modern Western Jews.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Having a measley 3-4% of human DNA that can also be found in the completely extinct Neanderthal&#39;s DNA only demonstrates just how very far apart and  incompatible the two separate species actually are. </p>

<p>The same will be found with any of the other so-called &quot;hominids&quot;, <em>Erectus, Robustus, Australopithecanthropus</em> et al, which were all separate and very different species with no possible connection or relationship to one another. </p>

<p>The gross error that the evolutionary enthusiasts refuse to accept or deal with is that the true nature of genetics is such that the lock-step process that ensures that every member of any species is a completely unique and never to be duplicated individual with an equally unique collection of the general traits, talents, and abilities of that belong to and identify that species, is also a lock-step and fool-proof mechanism that prohibits them from ever being or becoming anything other than a member of that species or displaying any characteristics that don&#39;t already belong to it.</p>

<p>Something that really is far more astounding and miraculous than the limited patterns and building blocks of life in Mother Nature&#39;s toolbox that each of them are independently constructed out of in a wide variety of different ways.</p>

<p>When the conditions of life exceed the range of any species particular talents and abilities that identify and make each of them what they are and their lives are quite simply no longer worth living, they become extinct. </p>

<p>It is not as postulated some struggle to simply &quot;survive&quot; for nature only induces enough stress to promote the normal functioning and a healthy range of actions in any species and between them and any other species. </p>

<p>Look at this way, if your life or that of any other life form was on the line every minute of every day there&#39;d be no will or purpose to it. You&#39;d very quickly shut-down and quit trying in the face of it.</p>

<p>Evolution as it is simplistically stated and promoted is based strictly on scientific materialism that will rationalize and accept any purely physical explanation it can concoct or dream-up, no matter how contradictory or illogical the actual facts surrounding it happen to be.</p>

<p>We routinely speak of individual species &quot;emerging&quot; or &quot;appearing&quot; and that are all perfectly adapted to the envirnorment in which they are found. </p>

<p>That&#39;s the reality and no amount of declaring that they must be related to and have come from some other species owing to certain similarities that only exist thousands of miles away or even on an other continent that they are genetically incompatible with is patently ridiculous. </p>

<p>Clearly the answer lies elsewhere and it is better to have no answer and pursue that issue elsewhere than to accept what is an unreasonable and by and large unprovable one.</p>
