<p>And I&#39;m not saying Trumps not dirty. Of course he is. But so are all politicians. The difference is TPTB have decided Trump is not conductive to their goals and are now in the process of removing him from office. And replacing him with ANYONE more sympathetic to the globalists is frightening indeed.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The deep state coup was originally presented as a counter-coup:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The Clintons have been involved in co-opting our White House, our Judiciary, our CIA, our Federal Bureau of Investigation, our Attorney General Loretta Lynch, and our Director of the FBI James Comey for some time now. What they’ve done is make sure that they were part and parcel of a group of people who were interrelated through political cronyism.</p>

<p>However, in order to stop this coup, we in the intelligence community and others involved have informally gotten together and with their permission I am beginning to announce that we initiated a counter-coup through Julian Assange and WikiLeaks …</p>

<p>We decided that there was something that we had to do in order to save the republic. So we initiated a counter-coup through Julian Assange who’s been very brave and really quite formidable in his ability to come forth and provide all the necessary emails that we gave to him in order to undermine Hillary and Bill Clinton… I am just a small part of something far bigger than myself…</p>

I was a long time AZ resident and I had some respect for McCain but I lost it all after he gave in to the RNC platform. Bush was a horrible president who destroyed personal freedoms and set the stage for all the shit that we are living with right now and McCain would have done more of the same.</p>

<p>In retrospect Obama did not do anything to really right the ship and that&#39;s all on him but the republican congress really put the brakes on him after 2 years. He was completely ineffective and gave in to compromises that were not good at all. </p>

<p>I see you as much more  of a drone.  A drone to the fact-less and proof-less world of mediocre conspiracy theories.

<p>If you&#39;re partisan and cannot break past the paradigm that both &quot;sides&quot; aren&#39;t different and do not work together to fuck us all without consent in the ass, then yes... you are nothing but a drone. Drones only do and say what they are taught/told to say. </p>

<p>See, there&#39;s one of those secret truths you believe that are false.  If you are interested in nuance and details, the system in the USA may suck but it does work and an individual vote does count if nothing than at the local level.</p>

<p>You&#39;re the one with the broken world view.  See, I can believe conspiracies with actual proof and such, and I also believe in voting and protesting and getting involved.  You reject that real thing which closes you off to new information and by definition, is a bubble. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You have a broken world view. The real conflict line is between the 36 primal lodges with some politicians who are even in several with conflicting agendas. They plan and execute the world wide events.</p>

<p>There you find all the key players, world wide. From Rothschild, Bush, Kennedy, Putin, Merkel, Kissinger, Brzezinski.....bankers, politicians, university professors(S. HP. Huntington rings a bell, I assume?), church figures.</p>

<p>I wish I could read Italian to fully grasp &quot;Massoni. Societa a responsibility illimitata. La scoperta delle Ur-Lodges&quot; by Gioele Magaldi, grand master of the masonry lodge &quot;Grande Oriente d&#39;Italia Democratic&quot; and Laura Maragnani talking with high level masonry cover identities.</p>

<p>Several of these identities in the book were uncovered since the release like Brzezinski.</p>

<p>It contains informations about Robert Kennedy&#39;s assassination, attack on Reagan and the Pope in relation to Masonry I&#39;m sure most have never ever heard before.</p>

<p>According to the book these primal lodges control &quot;para&quot; lodges like the Bilderbergs, Bohemian, Fabien, Pilgrim, Round Table, Tavistock....</p>

<p>And these organisations pretty much control our parties.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The guy is the model for Biff Tannen and they went after his lawyer. They got tons of shit on him, enough to pull his strings the rest of his term in office.</p>

<p>I also think it&#39;s funny that people assume I&#39;m some trump supporter. I didn&#39;t vote for him and was a supporter of Bernie Sanders. I supported the fact that Trump would occasionally throw wrenches into the globalist machinery, and that he wasn&#39;t pure rotten evil as Hillary is. And now that has been taken from, which is not good for any of the people against the globalist agenda. I alao think Trump was a genuine nationalist and cared about trying to make our country strong. Opposing TPP, Natalie, and pro tariffs were Bernie platforms too and Trump was following through on them. But that&#39;s all gone now, Trump is compromised and will either be a stooge or resign soon enough. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Nothing about Trump was genuine that’s what a conman narcissist does - he believes he is the smartest most able person in the room and will say and do anything to prove it to whomever is willing to listen to him. He lies for karma. </p>

<p>His whole life was a desperate plea to be one of the global elite. The financial world shunned him due to business incompetence in the 80s and 90s, Hollywood told him to fuck off over and over, so he ran to foreign money for support and capitalized on the stupid to become a reality brand. That was probably his most brilliant con ever until the current shit show that is. </p>

<p>Trump isn’t compromised by the globalists he is just a globalist charlatan doing his best to destroy the county because he is mad the elite think he is a douche. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Why do Trump supporters still perform mental gymnastics for the retard-in-chief?  It&#39;s getting fucking ridiculous.  The man is and always has been a total sham, and it was painfully obvious to me that he was going to screw over you conservative types, just like your leaders always do.  Conservative politicians thrive on the ignorance of their supporters, it&#39;s been that way since conservatism was a political thing.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I never said liberals or socialists are immune to ignorance.  What is true is that conservatives are, as a rule, dupes or liars.  The whole point of conservatism is to elevate the fucking aristocracy and bring back monarchism.  It&#39;s a shit ideology and conservative leaders don&#39;t even try to hide how they&#39;re fucking their supporters (and everyone who isn&#39;t rich or noble) in the ass.  In any decent word, conservatism would be laughed out of the public sphere, and the fight would be between liberals and socialists.  (Actual socialists, not whatever moronic definition of socialism Americans have been brainwashed to accept.)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Literally replace every reference to conservatives with liberals and nothing changes. The liberals and the socialists (which are pretty much the same damn thing here now) are the ones advocating to fuck us in the ass by repealing the 2A, opening our borders so every state can turn into the unequal shithole they&#39;ve turned California into and dumbing down our education system with common core. The fact is every single serious political ideology has been coopted to serve the movement towards a global government. Liberalism and the modern left as a whole are a cancer destroying the West from the inside and it&#39;s going to get violent before it&#39;s over.</p>
