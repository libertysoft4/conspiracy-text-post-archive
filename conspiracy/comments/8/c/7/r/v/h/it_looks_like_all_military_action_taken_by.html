    <div class="md"><p>Probably is the key world there.  I could say that Assad was probably gassing his own people.  His family has been in charge for a long time.  Maybe it is time to let someone else run the show.  The middle east has major problems.  Do you run these countries with an iron fist(like Hussein &amp; Assad) &amp; does the world let them do whatever they want by anymeans necessary or is it ok for global leaders like us/france/uk to make targeted strikes when they go to far?  Trump said when he announced this last night that maybe we can one day work with Iran... but maybe not.  These situations do not typically have a right/wrong answer - regardless of what choice is made bad shit is going to happen.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So am I, but I&#39;m by no means a liberal. I&#39;m (usually) a fan of Trump, but if you have the eyes to see, you could spot this scenario coming from miles away. I was hoping Trump was going to stand in opposition to the powers that be, but perhaps the script was written that way to divide our nation... We&#39;re all getting jerked around. The &quot;chemical&quot; attack in Syria was an obvious false flag, but we&#39;ve taken action against them anyway. This is bad news for everyone if this is how the story continues. Predetermined outcomes will come to fruition regardless of a relative foundation, and foundations will be invented to support the structure of lies from which our assaults will be launched.</p>

<p>As in liberals have aligned with War Pigs.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Generals gathered in their masses,
just like witches at black masses.
Evil minds that plot destruction,
sorcerer of death&#39;s construction.
In the fields the bodies burning,
as the war machine keeps turning.
Death and hatred to mankind,
poisoning their brainwashed minds...Oh lord yeah!</p>
