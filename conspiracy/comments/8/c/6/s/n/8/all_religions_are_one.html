        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>So*, I got to thinking about religions and I believe that at one point all religions were one.</p>

<p>I also believe that &#39;religion&#39; is a term lost in translation and the religions we worship are actually the grand story of our old civilisation.</p>

<p>Basically, we were an &#39;advanced ancient race&#39; (how advanced I have no idea, but we weren&#39;t in mud huts doing FA for 300,000). For whatever reason, we either set in motion a series of catastrophic events because of how we treated the planet OR the planet/nature wiped us all out (except a handful of people).</p>

<p>I believe the religious stories are real life tales of how to be a good person, how to care for each other and more most importantly of all how to save the human race.</p>

<p>I think there was one &#39;bible&#39; which held all of the greatest tales in our history and these stories were preserved to avoid us from repeating our past mistakes and wiping ourselves out completely.</p>

<p>On a side note; those who say &quot;if we were so advanced where is the evidence of it?&quot; I would like to respond with another question &quot;how long would our materials, cars, ships, buildings etc. take to break down into unrecognisable chunks of crap?&quot; Concrete wouldn&#39;t last 100,000 years. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think that human civilization as we would recognize it formed when humans settled as farmers. Most say this started in Mesopotamia. When people stayed put in larger numbers for an extended period of time, they developed complex language systems and other cultural traits - including an organized religion. Basing off of commonly accepted history, all of this points back to the Fertile Crescent but beyond that I have no idea. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thank you for this information.</p>

<p>So, religion is something that occurs within our brains (as a response to what, who knows?) but only when we are in safe and steady environments with a formed language system?</p>

<p>Could it be that &#39;religion&#39; has replaced our fear of nature? </p>

<p>Like, when we were &#39;cavemen&#39; we needed to fear or to at least understand the danger of our environment and nature. This fear drove us to adapt and evolve into safe societal groups. But when we removed this ancient fear of nature, we had a lack of evolutionary drive and thus replaced the fear of nature (a large known and unknown) with a manmade fear of &#39;God&#39;, in order to keep our species evolving?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don’t think it’s that complex. I think it was developed out of sun/celestial worship as that was attributed to crop growth and harvest.

    <div class="md"><p>Could it be somewhere between the two?</p>

<p>Yeah I believe all worship/religion or ideology comes from the worship of the &#39;light&#39; that is the sun. But how do you make a religion based on &quot;sun good, bring warmth and light. Dark bad&quot;?</p>

<p>I do believe the fluff and filler of religions is/was/are based on real stories of humanities life lessons. After all, we would have, at some point, started to document what happened to people.</p>

<p>&quot;UG tried fucking a raptor. Bad idea.&quot;
&quot;OG tried eating fire. Bad idea.&quot;</p>

<p>My view it that the bible is 2000yrs worth of Good idea/Bad idea (anybody remember that from animaniacs?)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Correct. Thank you for coming into my thread and contributing nothing to the main point. </p>

<p>But, you did at least read it, so props to you.</p>

<p>This was a general assumption, assuming that the theories of an advanced ancient race are correct. Personally, I don&#39;t believe that we sat on our arses playing with flint tools for 400,000+ years then accomplished everything in the last 5000 years. I mean, take the last 150 years for example. We&#39;ve gone from steam trains to hyper-sonic aircraft. </p>

<p>IF we did nothing for all those years, then accomplished everything in the blink of an eye respectively, then that means the human race won&#39;t exist (or will be severely reduced in numbers) in 50 years.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What came before Babylon? (genuinely asking, but I shouldn&#39;t really have to put this...should I?)</p>

<p>I do find it strange that Western religion teaches that the consequence to TAKING a negative action (murder, adultery etc.) is another negative action (you go to hell, cast out from society, suffer under God)</p>

<p>Where Eastern religion teaches (from my limited understanding) how to be a better person so that you can AVOID negative actions altogether, by becoming a better and more wholesome person.</p>

<p>It&#39;s like, western religion scares people into not doing things wrong and eastern religion teaches people not to do wrong. </p>

<p>It strikes me as odd how there can be such a localised, but polar opposite way of teaching the &#39;lessons&#39;</p>

<p>The Israelites were the first and only people to claim there was only 1 God. This was very radical at the time and the story of this is loosely documented in the Bible. God always told his people not to bow to Bael and Azeroth (Nimrod and his wife). </p>

    <div class="md"><p>There is one God. One creator. Jesus was his first creation. The old gods existed. They werent gods. But they were divine beings. Think saint in christianity. A spirit made divine by jesus. This was all before the first human on earth. The gods of rome and Greece are the same gods of Egypt and the mayans and the vimings. Same entities. Revealed themselves as different things based on local customs</p>

<p>The worship of the old gods is still permitted. You must only worship God before no others though. Theres a Jewish rabbi that does this (I do too). God first. The others after. No different than Catholics worship of varipus saints.</p>

<p>We needed the things taught by these old gods to advance spiritually as a species before the true God revealed hinself to us.</p>

<p>There is no hell. There is a lower and upper 4th dimension where negative spirits go to the lower. This is where the &quot;down to hell comes from&quot;</p>

<p>But there is no endless torture other than being around other negative twats. God loves all his creations. You are welcome to go up whenever you absolve your negativity. </p>

<p>I was raised Lutheran. High school I did the typical atheist edgelord thing. Senior year found Odin and went to war to gain favor and maybe go to Valhalla if I was lucky. </p>

<p>This is what ive learned between studying eastern, Hindu and native American techniques to kick over to a trance like state for meditation and a couple dmt trips.</p>

<p>Humanity as a while evolved with the advance of the times. However there was a noticeable change in our spiritual evolution around 1510 - 1540 ad. So likely sometime within a hundred or so years before that caused it as the change was something that took a generation or two to change. </p>

<p>The biggest issue is the gatekeeping of knowledge. The free sharing of the workings of the universe and God is highly regarded as the key to advancement. This is geberally an issue caused by abrahamic religions that staryed keepkng the aecrets of the mystics from the general population. </p>

<p>In order to get answers you must first seek knowledge. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have a vastly different opinion.</p>

<p>I believe most religions are different forms of the mysteries, which I believe date back to at least ancient Babylon.  The mysteries is quite the subject but I will try to sum it up briefly.  They are religions of symbolism.  One explanation of the symbolism is given to the general public.  This is called the exoteric.  The true meaning of the symbolism is only understood by the initiated.  This is called the esoteric.  Across the world, ancient cultures had initiations and similar symbolism.  To reduce the symbology down, you will find sun, moon, and star worship.  To boil it down further, the sun represents the bringer of light/knowledge. The moon represents the mystery schools and by teaching this knowledge, gives birth to many stars; the initiated.  The main object of worship is the sun.  As was written in the Bible, the serpent deceived Eve to eat of the tree of knowledge of good and evil.  I believe the serpent, Lucifer (the light bringer), and Satan (who can transform himself into an angel of light) all have the same underlying spirit of evil.  I believe the mystery religions are actually Luciferianism.  If you hang around here long enough, you will learn that the elite of the world are Satanists doing the most despicable evils that you could ever imagine.</p>

<p>As for your one doctrine for all religions idea, this is the basis for the New Age movement started in the late 1800s by H.P. Blavatsky, who wrote a book: The Secret Doctrine.  You will find that her Theosophical society is tied to Luciferianism as well.  Its ideas were highly influential on the Nazis.</p>

<p>I believe the religions of the world are coming together to form a one world religion as prophecized in the Bible.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Interesting theory.</p>

<p>I just think that all religions came from one idea. The &#39;bible&#39; or A &#39;bible&#39; of knowledge of all the lessons learned from the past. Maybe from different societies in our very early years or maybe it was information passed to us from our last civilisation? </p>

<p>Our language back then was very basic and I think we hang too much complexity on the stories in the bible. For example, Jesus fed the thousands with a few bits of bread and two dead fish. This could be translated as (this off the top of my head) : Bread is the body of Jesus, jesus was the saviour or Messiah, he made fish appear from almost nowhere to feed the starving thousands. Could this not be a lesson that although a river/stream may look empty of fish, delve into the body of the water to find thousands of fish and trust your instincts to know it will work?</p>

<p>O.K. so I&#39;m spit balling there, and I believe the Native Americans have similar tales. I believe the Chinese also do.</p>

<p>Can you understand the basic gist of what I&#39;m trying to get at or is it all mumbo-jumbo?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well that’s what the idea of H.P. Blavatsky’s The Secret Doctrine is.  She claimed to have been taught in Tibet by “ascended masters” the doctrine that all religions were based on.  In reality, she was a Luciferian occultist.</p>

<p>There isn’t much to go on but I wouldn’t be surprised if Plato’s Atlantis actually existed and the knowledge from that civilization spread to places like Egypt and Central America.  The Osirian cycle, Osiris represents the sun, Isis, the moon, when viewed in light of understanding of the mysteries, includes Osiris’s phallus being lost in a river.  The obelisk represents Osiris’s phallus.  I believe Osiris’s phallus represents knowledge lost in the flood.</p>

<p>The Bible tells of Nephilim/giants around the time of the flood.  Have you researched giant skeletons and how they are hidden from the public?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Questions around religion never seem to be answered with answers, only more questions. Which to me, is a question in and of itself. Why can&#39;t we answer these most important questions?</p>

<p>I have read how the Smithsonian is keeping giants a secret. I don&#39;t think it&#39;s necessarily the giants they are keeping secret, but what the giants meant/represented. </p>

<p>From what I have seen/read the Native Americans had contact with these giants. I wonder what they worshipped and how they were wiped out? Did the Europeans bring disease that killed them off, or were they long dead before Ponce De Leon?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I believe it is because it is beneficial for the controllers to craft their own version of reality so that we are more useful to them.  Knowledge is withheld by them.  In their pyramid structure, only the one(s) at the top truly know anything and even then, I believe they are lies of the devil.</p>

<p>Giants throw a wrench in their tale of evolution and human history.  It also gives credibility to the Bible.</p>

<p>The Bible says the Nephilim/giants are the offspring of fallen angels mating with human women.  If you read the Book of Enoch, which is not part of the Bible, it goes into more detail on them and how they were evil.  I believe their existence was a large reason why God brought forth the flood.  If I remember correctly, it is debated whether giants existed after the flood biblically.</p>
