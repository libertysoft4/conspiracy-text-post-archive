        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Stores like Target <em>allegedly</em> track our MacID&#39;s  while we walk around the store. They closely monitor how long we looked at a product via timing which aisles you spend the most time in.</p>

<p>If this creeps you out, and you stop visting, they have a solution. Mail special custom printed coupons to your house when their latest data reveals you haven&#39;t stopped by in awhile. Their database formula shows you missed more than one expected visit in the expected timeframe. So they give you coupons! Please come back friend, here&#39;s 50 cents off your favorite food!! Not interested? Here, take $ 1 off a comedy DVD from the rack near where you stood for 2 minutes last month!
As you go through the book you realize every deal in the book is something you&#39;ve bought,  even stuff you picked up and put back for another day. </p>

<p>Think this is unsettling? This is just one retail store&#39;s datamining operation. Imagine all the details Google, Apple, Facebook, etc. have been tracking and taking off your devices...year after year.  Wonder what formulas and profiles they&#39;ve developed in secret? </p>

<p>Or maybe you don&#39;t care what they know? I mean sure they didn&#39;t force you to accept their privacy policies. Just accept or don&#39;t own their phone? Easy choice, totally reasonable request right?  They didn&#39;t force you to grant them Mic and GPS Permission did they? They didn&#39;t enable every permission by default right? I don&#39;t know so many apps I forget which app does what. </p>

<p>Pretty sure the app asked for my location an contacts but they said loud and clear they only need it so my iAppleAndroidWatchWear works as good as it looks. At least I think that&#39;s what they meant. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Lol, it’s pretty funny that every big box store (Walmart, Home Depot, Lowe’s, etc,) you inexplicably lose cell service completely which  forces you to go on the WiFi network if you use your phone. It’s a guess, not a definite, I do know for sure that they use jammers at my work (fed govt) but I’m sure I signed on to that one. </p>

<p>Also, the reason I think jammers is bc the way your phone works (or ceases to work) in a big box store is the same exact way it happens at my job where I know they jam signals for security. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This isn&#39;t true. </p>

<p>Best Buy (for instance) has no reason to block your cellphone signal for one. Second of all, the amount of wattage and devices needed to block a cellphone signal is incredibly expensive to buy and costly to maintain over such a large area. There are multiple bands of signals that you would have to keep track of times however many stores you own. </p>

<p>The reason your signal drops when you walk into a steel and brick and structure with a metal roof is because the building is a giant Faraday cage. Walk outside and see how badly your signal is &quot;jammed&quot;</p>

<p>It isn&#39;t profitable to jam cellphone signals. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Valid concern with the wifi, I honestly don&#39;t know enough about it...</p>

<p>As for the GPS, it&#39;s not something stores would be doing most likely, but corporations (apple, google, FB, etc.) can and do as they see fit. Not an expert but I think they get inside the software to leave the &quot;GPS door&quot; open, so to speak.  Pardon the laymen terminology.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>iOS has had mac randomization implemented by default, since iOS 8 in 2014. (Android by toggled setting) Every time it pings the AP the device self-reports a different mac. The process was recently cracked (reverse engineered) by security researchers. The entire thing is hardly clandestine. Stores use it for exactly what you think they would use it for. Generating traffic maps for maximizing store layout and basic information about how people flow inside an area and of course, wifi coverage. To actually link your personal information to the device (assuming they went thru the trouble of decrypting the spoofed mac generated by your device) they would have to have access to the manufacturer&#39;s database of WIFI macs and assigned devices then the would have to contact the wireless carrier to see which WLAN MAC is assigned to what user. Even after all of that information gathering you would still only have the account owner&#39;s information. Not to mention all of the corporate cellular accounts and multi-line accounts that exist. </p>

<p>So, Target could conceptually do this to attempt to get the information of a person who wants to remain anonymous. OR, simply use all of the data people voluntarily give them thru; their app, location data they purchase from companies that you willingly allow your location to be tracked by, and of course, devices that actually opt into connecting to their wifi (unmasking your MAC.)</p>

<p>The best wifi systems can only potentially gather this information. You still have to compile and analyze all of it with major back-end computing/programming with the resources of a mid range retail store.  </p>

<p>Not impossible, but the efficacy score on this is close to zero considering the way they can legally and far more efficiently collect this information thru other means. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re probably right. I had a somewhat unsettling experience yesterday.</p>

<p>Most of us have read the stories about phones allegedly listening to our conversations and serving ads based on them.</p>

<p>I&#39;m using an application on my android phone (&quot;Network Cell Info Lite&quot; for the curious) that serves ads at the bottom of the gui (because it&#39;s a &quot;free&quot; version), and yesterday it served me an ad for a specific company showing two specific products which I had looked at on this companys website (I had also placed an order for a different set of products from the same company the same day).</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know how they were able to link that information to my phone, because</p>

<ol>
<li>I&#39;ve never browsed this companys website from my phone, only my main computer</li>
<li>I&#39;ve never used the facebook application on my phone</li>
<li>The Google account linked on my phone is different from the one I use on my main computer</li>
</ol>

<p>The only two facts that I believe <em>might</em> have helped &quot;them&quot; link this information to my phone is</p>

<ol>
<li>I spoke the company name in a voice memo I recorded a few hours before seeing the ad</li>
<li>I use wifi on my phone while at home, so outgoing connections from my phone are coming from the same IP address as my main computer</li>
</ol>

<p>At the specific moment when the ad got served, I was away from home and using a cellular data connection.</p>

<p>Someone needs to get the bottom of why these things happen. There appears to be a mind-bogglingly large amount of data mining going on behind the scenes that we probably can&#39;t even begin to comprehend the extent of.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>While the targeted ads after you don’t come back in are a little unsettling, I think this has to be a part of the revamped target security following the hack a few years back. It’s probably much easier to stop treats or at least minimize them while everyone has a specific ID for their access to store internet. </p>

<p>Also as for how much google or Facebook have collected, does nobody read TOS or even a little bit? </p>

<p>A few years ago when everyone was starting to install the Facebook messenger app, and it has the clause in there about “everything you type on your keyboard will be logged and tracked. Everything you ever have or will type will be tracked.” Same sort of thing with all those gif or sticker apps. </p>

<p>What the hell did people think they wrote in the 3k pages of TOS? </p>

<p>It explicitly says it not so many words “if you agree to this you can use it but we know everything”. Oh hell no. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>On a lighter note; I can&#39;t remember the last time I saw a commercial. Ever since giving up TV, I&#39;ve really picked up on just how intrusive advertising as whole really is. Prior to dropping TV, I never gave it any thought, but once I did, I started to notice the other ways that companies attempt to influence your decision-making and choices in general.</p>

<p>I think this might be a reason why we&#39;re beginning to see this kind of approach in the general marketplace. Ever since I stopped watching TV, I&#39;ve come across more and more people who <em>don&#39;t</em> watch broadcast TV or even cable TV. Why deal with intrusive TV ads when you Netflix or stream content cheaper and on-demand. As a result, companies had to adapt to how the consumer perceives advertising as the ads they&#39;d usually watch are no longer effective. The average person already views advertising in a poor light to begin with so any measure that is surreptitious or subtle enough to go generally unnoticed while still having an effect equal or even greater to previous methods is something they will seize on.</p>
