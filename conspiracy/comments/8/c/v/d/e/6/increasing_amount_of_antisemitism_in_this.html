        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I’ve seen a huge influx in antisemitism on this subreddit. In the past, the sub has usually known the line between antizionism and antisemitism. Now the latter seems to be thriving, and it seems to have come out of nowhere. Holocaust denial is common, as is the idea that all Jews are involved in some global conspiracy to turn us away from Christian values. </p>

<p>Just beware that racism will only further isolate this subreddit and could be potentially be very dangerous for it. I even wonder whether shills are coming here to spread antisemitic rhetoric to discredit the sub and even get it banned. This growth in antisemitism seems to have come at a time when the sub has grown a lot. Perhaps this is shills trying to find a way to kill its popularity.</p>

You prefer to exclude arabs from the definition of Semite or is it more about using a falsehood to manipulate discussion for the sheer joy of trickery it gives you?

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not excluding arabs from the definition of semites. They are semites. It is simply that the dictionary definition of antisemitism regards prejudice and hostility towards Jews.

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s a poor description of opposition to Zionism, and as a populace Americans should argue to rectify that definition, because that is not how anti-Zionism is universally understood, and dictionaries should reflect what words are universally understood to mean, just as they do with &quot;antisemitism&quot;.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>The use of <strong>esp</strong> being hugely important and justification for the use in terms of non-Jewish Semites. </p>

<p>Anyway, rather than quoting dictionaries all day, my point is that UOP are not the purveyors of language. They only document it. And as you can see from my examples, the big 3 dictionary publishers all document it in different ways. </p>

<p>To me that says they all have their own agenda attached. In those cases it is safest to revert back to the true meaning of the word, meaing that the all Semites (or children of Shem/Sam) are considered.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>But &quot;antisemitism&quot; is very rarely contested in general discourse.  Everyone understands what people mean by it, because everyone uses it these days to describe prejudice against Jews. I&#39;ve never seen it used to describe prejudice against all semitic people.

    <div class="md"><p>See: &quot;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_antisemitism">new anti-semitism</a>&quot;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>New antisemitism is the concept that a new form of antisemitism has developed in the late 20th and early 21st centuries, emanating simultaneously from the far left, Islamism, and the far right, and that it tends to manifest itself as opposition to Zionism and the State of Israel. The concept generally posits that much of what is purported to be criticism of Israel by various individuals and world bodies, is, in fact, tantamount to demonization, and that, together with an alleged international resurgence of attacks on Jews and Jewish symbols, and an increased acceptance of antisemitic beliefs in public discourse, such demonization represents an evolution in the appearance of antisemitic beliefs.</p>

<p><strong>Proponents of the concept argue that anti-Zionism, anti-Americanism, anti-globalization, third worldism, and demonization of Israel, or double standards applied to its conduct, may be linked to antisemitism, or constitute disguised antisemitism.</strong></p>

<p>Critics of the concept argue that it conflates anti-Zionism with antisemitism, defines legitimate criticism of Israel too narrowly and demonization too broadly, trivializes the meaning of antisemitism, and exploits antisemitism in order to silence political debate.</p>

<p>This over-usage creates a natural doth protest too loudly Streisand effect, whereby the curious start checking what the fuss is all about. Then it doesn&#39;t take much to see a pattern- namely that the &quot;anti-semite&quot; accusation is weaponized language designed to game people. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree with this. The antisemitism label is bandied around far too much. Most things labelled antisemitism aren&#39;t antisemitism. Sometimes, as in the case of criticising the US/FR/UK bombings of Syria, it&#39;s not even anti-Zionist (not that anti-Zionism is a problem anyway).

    <div class="md"><p>In terms of current events there is a renewal of attention on the neocons and neoliberals (basically the same). Jews don&#39;t have a monopoly on these threats, but they are very overrepresented versus their numbers (2%) in the population. These are people who identify as Jews and use their in-group think tanks, and media contacts to warmonger. </p>

<p>Then if other Jews (or gentiles) stand for peace, they are gamed, trashed and diminshed. You won&#39;t see their columns in Wapo or the NYT.  Why did Haaratz feel compelled to slur the alt-right about the issue of war in Syria?  Why is that a story? What is Israel&#39;s agenda?</p>

<p>True Jews aren&#39;t a monolith, but there bad dynamic here where bad actors who are Judiacs are amplified. And who amplifies them? Can you debate that question without resorting to the one trick pony anti-semite tagging? Does that make me an anti-semite to say this? If so -did my view come out of a vaccum? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think Jewish families have a lot of old money, and that has lead them to getting lots of elite positions in government and business. Jews are far more likely to be Zionists than other demographics, so you see this filtering into politics. This essentially is because for Jews, Israel holds a very special place in their hearts. However, when push comes to shove, this love for Israel will fail in the face of money. If you want to look at a demographic with far more power than the Jews, you should look at the Arab ultra-elite. The Arabs aren&#39;t powerful because of some ideological reason, it&#39;s simply because they happen, as a result of simple geography, to control a lot of the oil industry, through which America gets huge amounts of money. If you want a solid example that the Arab ultra-elite are more powerful than Israel, you need to look no further than the Yom Kippur War, when the KSA forced the US to stop supporting Israel by enacting an oil embargo against them.</p>

<p>The reality is that there are lots of powerful groups in the world. But the idea that Jews are some kind of united cabal that have perfectly designed the trajectory of history to spurn the other races and give themselves supremacy is clearly just an attempt to simplify things so that there is only one true enemy, that enemy being the Jews. This is clearly antisemitic and clearly completely clueless.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Antisemitism has been a near meaningless catch-all knee jerk defense when accountability is demanded for those who feel no need to account for their actions.</p>

<p>Some very bad and powerful people hide behind their religious affiliations and feel morbidly entitled.</p>

<p>Global conspiracies exist and sometimes people who identify as Jews undertake them. </p>

<p>So do lots of other people.</p>

<p>You know whenever events cause people to consider Israeli influence and manipulation in America these squeamish posts about &quot;antisemitism&quot; inevitably follow. </p>

<p>If a post goes too far and the identity politics become too rancorous and hateful, call that shit out, but your vague appeal to stop criticizing power and influence being used for solely &quot;Jewish State&quot; interests rings hollow.   </p>

<p>literally their own fault. Jews started actively abandoning europe in the 1970s to move to Israel/the united states then decided that they would &#39;get back&#39; at europe for it&#39;s &#39;history of antisemetism&#39; by encouraging muslim immigration to destroy european nations. </p>

<p>Jews complaining about the rise of antisemetism in europe while actively engaging in activities literally designed to increase it is the biggest joke of the 21st century.</p>
