<p>On another topic, has anyone noticed when opening certain posts in r/conspiracy the whole page flicks at you like a camera shutter would? I have not noticed this with any other subs, just here, like your mobile is taking a picture of you when opening specific posts. Could be to build a facial recognition database or building a database of users who are active in this sub.. </p>

<p>It may sound paranoid but I&#39;d rather be vigilant than willingly accept  anything that seems out of the ordinary.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think you&#39;re misunderstanding what I&#39;m saying, or I wasn&#39;t being clear. I&#39;m not talking about <em>my</em> threads and comments being downvoted. I&#39;m talking about other threads and comments I have upvoted (and not even participated in) where my upvote disappears, as if I never upvoted it at all. And no, its not just a page refresh problem or hitting back without loading the page, because I assumed thats what it was at first so I made a point to be sure my vote actually stuck. There will be threads where I will upvote many comments, and then I will return half an hour later and see that a lot of my upvotes are missing. There will always be gap of time where my upvote stayed before it was deleted. And often, the comments missing upvotes would be for popular/high profle users who are saying something controversial. This doesn&#39;t happen in other subs like r/aww my hometown sub or any other fun/hobby/entertainment sub. It only happens to me in conspiratorial or political threads and subs. I know, because I&#39;ve been paying attention to this for years. I know what I&#39;ve seen.</p>

<p>And no one gets banned for not agreeing on politics. Everyone that gets banned is almost always from being an asshole and very clearly violating the rules. The modlogs are public.

This is the downfall of the Internet were seeing. Moderators and admin‘s are just self policing citizens that think they have power but are really just destroying everybody’s free speech at every turn. When you give somebody power to edit what people see/read, that’s some powerful shit. I don’t like some ass hat deciding what I can and cannot read.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I completely agree with everything you just wrote. But what does any of that have to do with r/conspiracy? I&#39;d argue that the mods here are far more accountable than nearly all other subreddits, because there are representatives from both sides of the isle on the mod team.</p>

<p>If anyone has an example of getting banned for simply disagreeing, I&#39;m open to seeing it. But the only people making that claim are TMOR users, who are not typically known for their politeness or civility.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah but sometimes I feel like there are just topics that are so big it’s very hard to be polite or civil at times. I don’t think that deleting the person’s comments though are away to go about making a better world. Imagine watching some sort of a court movie or something and all you got to see was the verdict at the end. You never got to watch the trial or anything. Wouldn’t you want to know what led up to the decision? I know I would but the fact that I don’t even get the option to see what the fuck happened or who dropped the bomb or why it is very concerning to me. I understand that it’s reddit’s platform their tools yady yada but in every facet of the Internet they always rely on free users and free info so in a sense we built the Internet not them. It’s One of those things where they won’t exist without us and we won’t exist without it.</p>

<p>There&#39;s a difference between not being polite or civil, and not attacking/insulting/being an all around douche bag to people that disagree with you politically. The ones who get banned exhibit the latter.</p>

<p>There&#39;s more transparency here than most other subs on reddit. Which is why I say again, I agree with your grievances, I just think they are being misapplied to the current topic.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Why would they do it like that though? It&#39;s just inviting you to vote again. I do believe that some votes simply aren&#39;t counted but they don&#39;t <em>tell</em> you, it&#39;s like shadowbanning a person. If your vote disappears it&#39;s more likely there was a connection issue and it just wasn&#39;t logged properly. </p>

<p>If this is a conspiracy, it is very poorly done.</p>
