        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>The Iraq War was about getting access to Iraq&#39;s stargate technology. There is a stargate in one of the ziggurat temples, left there by the Anunnaki from Sumerian times. This stargate is a wormhole that allows for instant travel across spacetime.</p>

<p>&quot;Back in the 1920s the Iraq StarGate was uncovered in Baghdad. This StarGate was surrounded by the “Green Zone” during the Iraqi War and was the whole purpose for the war. Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD’s) were an excuse. Having control of the StarGate was the goal of the Bush Administration as well as Nazi Germany. This was a repeat of when Hitler and Nazi Germany went to Iraq to fight against the British as both wanted control of the Iraq StarGate. Führer Directive No. 30 dealt with German intervention in support of Arab Nationalists in the Kingdom of Iraq. During the 1930s, representatives of Nazi Germany and Fascist Italy attempted to gain favor with various Iraqi nationalists and promised support against the British. On 2 May 1941, after tensions mounted on both sides, the British launched pre-emptive land strikes against Iraqi forces and the Anglo-Iraqi War began. Rashid Ali immediately requested that the Germans make good on the earlier promises of assistance. The International Zone (formerly known as the Green Zone) is the heavily guarded diplomatic/government area of closed-off streets in central Baghdad where US occupation authorities live and work. The Green Zone in the central city includes the main palaces of former President Saddam Hussein where the StarGate is located in the basement of the main palace. The area houses the civilian ruling authority run by the Americans and British and the offices of major US consulting companies. Prescott Bush had furnished weapons to Nazi Germany to arm them for World War II.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have had a running theory, which started as a joke, that Stargate SG1 was a form of soft disclosure. I am starting to take it a bit more seriously; I had a buddy introduce me into predictive programming, and somewhere along the way the theory got more serious.</p>

<p>Anyhow, for those familiar with the series, check out episode 200. This was the one that made me really wonder.</p>

<p>Read up on Dulce, the Secret Space Program (Emmery Smith) and Bob Lazar. It matches perfectly. The Army used hollywood for propaganda, why wouldnt they do it now?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;Stargate Project&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;The Project, and its precursors and sister projects, went by various code names—GONDOLA WISH, GRILL FLAME, CENTER LANE, SUN STREAK, SCANATE—until 1991 when they were consolidated and rechristened as &quot;Stargate Project&quot;.</p>

<p>Stargate Project work primarily involved remote viewing, the purported ability to psychically &quot;see&quot; events, sites, or information from a great distance.[1] The project was overseen until 1987 by Lt. Frederick Holmes &quot;Skip&quot; Atwater, an aide and &quot;psychic headhunter&quot; to Maj. Gen. Albert Stubblebine, and later president of the Monroe Institute.[2] The unit was small-scale, comprising about 15 to 20 individuals, and was run out of &quot;an old, leaky wooden barracks&quot;.[3]</p>

<p>The Stargate Project was terminated and declassified in 1995 after a CIA report concluded that it was never useful in any intelligence operation(I highly doubt that).&quot;</p>

<p>In the siege of 1258, Genghis khan&#39;s grandson laid siege to Baghdad at its height.</p>

<p>Maybehe found something.</p>

<p>There were always rumors that Genghis Khan was questing for advanced technologies that had been found.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>OK, let&#39;s imagine for a moment that this is true. It&#39;s <em>not</em> true, and only a nitwit would believe it, but let&#39;s imagine that it&#39;s true for the sake of argument.</p>

<p>What use is this astonishing secret weapon to anyone? </p>

<p>It didn&#39;t help Saddam Hussein much. He clearly didn&#39;t have allies from outer space to call on in 2003. </p>

<p>And he didn&#39;t have any advanced extraterrestrial technology either, or he wouldn&#39;t have been dicking around with mustard gas and crap like that.</p>

<p>Not only that, but rather than escape to the other side of the universe through his secret stargate when Iraq was invaded, he hid in a hole in the ground instead, got caught, and was hanged.</p>

<p>Doesn&#39;t all this kind of suggest that there is no stargate?</p>

<p>&quot;Stargate Project&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;The Project, and its precursors and sister projects, went by various code names—GONDOLA WISH, GRILL FLAME, CENTER LANE, SUN STREAK, SCANATE—until 1991 when they were consolidated and rechristened as &quot;Stargate Project&quot;.</p>

<p>Stargate Project work primarily involved remote viewing, the purported ability to psychically &quot;see&quot; events, sites, or information from a great distance.[1] The project was overseen until 1987 by Lt. <a href="https://www.resavr.com/comment/invaded-iraq-over-stargate-10684216">[Continued...]</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>You know what, I used to think this too.  I am a Trekkie, and sneered at my wife for watching Stargate.  Then I did, and I realized why it has such a huge and fanatic following.  It <em>is</em> nonsensical, but it knows it and they have no problem making fun of themselves.  If anything the show could be considered a comedy.  It is an amazing ride, all of it.  The two spinoffs are just as brilliant in their own way.</p>

<p>Star Trek is serious business.  You are tense, you have the chills.  It isn&#39;t funny because situations that serious can&#39;t be funny.  In Stargate, obviously the fate of the World and the lives of everyone in the show teeter on the edge at every moment as well, but they have chosen to just accept it and make wisecracks along the way.</p>

<p>Without Teal&#39;c, the show would be a decent and worthy series to enjoy.  His character transcends this, though, and brings the whole rest of the show along for the ride.  The best moments of this show are definitely going to be moments involving Teal&#39;c.  I mean, him sitting in the theater watching the movie...   </p>
