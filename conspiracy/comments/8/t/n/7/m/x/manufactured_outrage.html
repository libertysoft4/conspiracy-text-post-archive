<p>From one issue to another like the last one never happened, our society takes the bite everytime. We are told what to talk about and why its important to engage in a public debate about it. </p>

<p>Whatever the issue is... It always fails to compare with truly important issues. </p>

<p>Do people honestly think that the issue of the day being kids/parents/illegal immigration is of utmost importance over other issues?</p>

<p>What&#39;s been going on for awhile now is textbook manufacturing of peoples thoughts and reality. TBTB know a large portion of Americans and all people in general are gullible and depend on mainstream media for their daily &quot;what&#39;s going on in the world&quot; updates. </p>

<p>If you&#39;re on this subreddit then you&#39;ve already explored the truth way more than the people who believe in pop culture politics and beliefs. </p>

<p>Stay diligent in knowing that the national and local media nationwide are the true oppressors. Stay virtuous in your continued journey for the truth and knowledge. And always remember Love will prevail through the darkness of deceit and manipulation. </p>

<p>Stayed tuned for tomorrows mainstream  media&#39;s BIG story selected by a handful of people behind a curtain. </p>

Why did it take you so long after asking &#39;why&#39; </p>

<p>Question- So.. no detention centers for 600,000 people a year crossing illegally? </p>

<p>Option 1- Build the Wall 
Option 2- Catch and deport immediately
Option 3- Build the Wall and Catch and deport</p>

<p>Boom, that hurts the detention centers. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Catch and elease only bennefitts detension center owners. Waste of time and money to even capture illegals if all we are going to do is release them. The ultimat answer has several parts but it primarily includes building a 30 foot wall on the border. This, combined with severe financial penalties levied  against employers of illegal aliens is a must for any border control. I mean literally shutting down businesses that have been caught 3 times hiring illegal aliens. The physical deterrant of a wall limits points of crossing as well as helps with a consistant roadway for border control vehicles. Herd the illegals into choke points being the only crossings. These two actions alone would reduce the illegal alien desire to come here to begin with a tenfold. Next would be strwight out death penalties for all coyotes and large scale dealers caught. Yes, we have to.step down a few moralities to get their attention.</p>
