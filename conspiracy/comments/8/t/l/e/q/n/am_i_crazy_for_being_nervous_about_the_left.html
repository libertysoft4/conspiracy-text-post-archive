<p>I’m not a trump supporter but I am a conservative and don’t think he’s as bad as they make him out to be.</p>

<p>They’ve spent the last three years dehumanizing and demonizing white people/trump supporters and clearly only have intentions on ramping it up. They’ve created a culture where you’re literally not allowed to even slightly disagree with them or else you’re looked at as an oppressor.</p>

<p>Do you know the amount of money that goes into demonizing white people and trump supporters? SNL, every news network, every celebrity, every tv show and movie, academia, ALL anti-white and anti-trump. Why would they spend so much time and money doing this if it wasn’t part of a bigger plan?</p>

<p>Isn’t anyone worried about the types of oppressive laws against us they’ll try to pass? I mean it could very well be the first step towards gulags and death camps.</p>

<p>Maybe I’m crazy? I know I know, the gulag can NEVER come to America for reasons no one can ever seem to explain to me lol.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You seem intellectually dishonest. The person you replied to said &quot;Dems are not even left wing&quot; and you reply &quot;yes left and right have the same masters&quot;. Dems and Republicans haven&#39;t even been centrist or moderate right for decades. They&#39;re both two shades of far right corporatism economics.</p>

<p>Also you seem to want to push left vs right divide and conquer by just shitting on &quot;leftist extremists&quot; as if rightist extremists don&#39;t exist.</p>

<p>I tell you how incrdibly distorted your world view is.....the violent SJWs (that artificially make leftists look bad) are funded by billionaire extreme right NEOliberal oligarch George Soros.  SJW does not = left. Racist does not = right. Corporate media is extreme right, that includes CNN which shat on Bernie Sanders. SJW shit doesn&#39;t change anything. Economics do.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Totally on the same page as you. Media does not represent reality.</p>

<p>I meant to say Dem and Repubs have the same masters, but yea it does seem like my intention was to distort his comment. My apologies, wasn&#39;t reading closely enough.</p>

<p>My opinion is that Dem and Repubs follow identical policies and if either is presented with an opportunity to put a group of peasants in work camps they are happy to. I believe currently the extreme left (controlled opposition sitting in board rooms at universities) is polluting many institutions with the kind of talk that could get white people put in camps.</p>

<p>Is this all extremely unlikely? Sure. But still worth talking about just to take notice of how insane our institutions have gotten.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Alright just be careful with wording....we have enough divide and conquer shills infesting this sub and reddit as a whole. SJWs are annoying but threat number 1 is corporatism. The elites control these corps and manufactured SJW culture to divide people, and falsely associate twisted illogical SJWism with actual leftism. I&#39;m center left rather than far left but even some far left people aren&#39;t SJWs. SJWs slow down the revolution by complaining about garbage like gender pay gap (even if it was true, it&#39;s nothing compared to how much workers are getting ripped off by corporations and corporately bribed government). </p>

<p>There are also very right wing politicians who act like SJWs. E.g. Germany&#39;s Merkel is economically very right wing but SJW in a way since she&#39;s been pro-mass immigration for a long time. I&#39;m not against helping immigrants but mass immigration is artificial and caused by the elites: war, globalist corporate jobs outsourcing and corruption in poorer countries is what makes people desire to move to a &quot;richer&quot; country. It doesn&#39;t have to be this way. If the people demanded removal of money from politics and implement better regulation of corporations, we would have a better fairer economy. Just to put in perspective, this is how corporatist the two party system is:</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think trying to have those conversations on Reddit or any social media is going to be met in that manner, it’s a hostile environment. When everyone knows there are paid shills/trolls, every comment is taking from a place of defense. It’s eroded our ability to have productive conversations without thinking you are talking with someone that is paid to sway your opinion. </p>

<p>Another thing that stands in the way of productive dialogue is respect. Many have lost the ability to respect one another and opinions that are different from our own. I’m not entirely sure what has created this lack of respect, but it’s very apparent here and irl. </p>

<p>Now, that’s not to say the conversations can’t be had productively here, it’s just not likely. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This sub is highly infiltrated with paid shills who pretend ALL left wingers are SJWs. It&#39;s 100% a psyop (although some have been organically fooled into believing this narrative). Dems/Repubs/Libertarian party are all EXTREME right wing NEOliberal corporatist extremists, similar to Ayn Rand the sociopath (USSR probably drove her crazy but her ideology is just as bad as authoritarian Stalinist tankie ideology if not worse -- both lead to oppression of the people/workers). </p>

<p>This is what the real U.S. spectrum looks like, it will never be shown on NEOliberal CORPORATE MEDIA:</p>

<p><a href="https://i.imgur.com/fUH4nZp.png">https://i.imgur.com/fUH4nZp.png</a></p>

<p>The NWO is a fascistic dictatorship on a global scale:</p>

<p><a href="https://i.imgur.com/bNz2DHP.jpg">https://i.imgur.com/bNz2DHP.jpg</a></p>

<p>Corporatism is the biggest enemy, SJW crap is a pest in comparison and a tool at worst. Corporate media pushes SJW shit for divide and conquer and to try to remove free speech, try to cover for globalist corporate economics and manipulate people into certain twisted political positions. But as long as corporations can bribe our government, we are FUCKED. This whole SJW vs alt right horseshit is divide and conquer and they&#39;re trying to make us pick from two shit ideologies. TWO DUMB BOXES!!! I thought it was.....a spectrum bruh.</p>

<p>Trump being criticized by corporate media means nothing to me just like corporate Obama being criticized by corporate Fox News but not corporate CNN. PSYOP PSYOP PSYOP. I grew bored of the 3D chess theory once I realized there was so little evidence. Trump still hasn&#39;t implemented universal healthcare. Shills on this sub are making it clear that it&#39;s business as usual Dem vs Repub identity politics garbage. Both parties suck. I don&#39;t give a fuck about U.S. or Russian oligarchs. Both sociopaths to me, Putin doesn&#39;t seem like a savior imo.</p>

<p>Even &quot;free market&quot; has been tainted to mean &quot;zero regulations&quot; by NEOliberal shills but the true
definition is &quot;perfectly competitive market&quot; which is a theoretical concept......closest is a FAIR market, meaning fair regulation of the market/banking to stop mafia corporations screwing us over. This requires money to be removed from politics first, so that gov is controlled by the people, not the corporations/elite central banksters. (Well, secret societies are also involved so they also need to be purged)</p>

<p>I can write a lot more but I&#39;ll stop now.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks! That little square is anarcho-communism (not in the infiltrated violent SJW Antifa/CringeAnarchy™ sort of way). I&#39;m not one of those people who say &quot;it&#39;s impossible, will never happen!&quot; but I think it&#39;s impractical to jump immediately to anarcho-communism like some subs are obsessed with (not only do workers directly control the means of production but much harder: it&#39;s a moneyless, stateless, classless society). Seems extremely difficult to achieve democratically let alone without hiccups. Even just replacing capitalism scares people. Hence I usually promote center left non-authoritarian Democratic Socialism (British Socialism-Clement Atlee/Jeremy Corbyn) or social democracy/centrism (Bernie/FDR) or slightly right wing (JFK ?) but not center right or extreme right/corporatism/NEOliberalism.</p>

<p>Anarcho-com probably requires unlimited resources/tech to work so no sociopaths get greedy/powerful again. Abundance would probably stop most greed even from sociopaths. Maybe I&#39;m ignorant on the topic but I see it as something hundreds and hundreds of years away to be truly implemented flawlessly. </p>

<p>This is like a basic meme trying to explain the fake communist (Stalinism/tankies) vs real communist vs libertarian socialism in a simple way. </p>

<p>Let&#39;s be real, a majority of the opposition to the establishment currently happens to be white. Immigrants are so jaded from their oppressive regimes they have not yet been hit with the realization that ours is a pit of evil.</p>

<p>This is the reason for the current anti-white narrative. The natives are rebelling (white people), time to replace them with those whose are more subservient/ already have lost hope.</p>
