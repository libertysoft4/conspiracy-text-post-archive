        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Hicks&#39; comedy was not only critical of the ruling class and the elite power structure, but his message was also one of unity and promoting peace. Today, his work is online for all to see, and standup comedians are traditionally targeted by TPTB. Their unique blend of philosophy, criticism of the ruling class, and disarming comedy is very effective at reaching and enlightening the masses. </p>

<p>Therefore, I think the disinformation agents came up with a way to tie him to Alex Jones, somebody who seems to be universally hated by the people on this sub, rightfully so. In my opinion it&#39;s just a clever way to deflect from any good Bill Hicks content and start a big argument that deflects from the actual content. Thus, the &quot;Bill Hicks is Alex Jones!&quot; meme was born.</p>

<p>Hicks was laid back, an advocate for peace and the protection of our civil liberties. He advocated the use of psychedelic drugs as a means of self exploration and therapy, and divorced himself from partisan politics. Jones is a hyperactive right wing extremist who supports the current establishment. Their mannerisms and appearances alone are so vastly different, it&#39;s not even remotely close.</p>

<p>Not every rabbit hole is harmless folks. Sometimes theres a sinister intention behind these seemingly &quot;fun and silly&quot; Pandora&#39;s box type conspiracies, as seems to be the case with the Alex Jones/Hicks theory.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, it infected conspiracy communities like a wave a decade ago. You would have had to been there. The tangible and empirical evidence that we went there is freely available. You guys are making the claim that it was a hoax, burden of proof is on you. I am voicing the opinion that it is a psyop. This is just a possible explanation for why this ludicrous theory exists, it could be wrong, but that doesn&#39;t make the theory any less artificial. </p>

<p>But here, try this...go google anything related to the moon landing as a hoax being a psyop. You will find nothing but the moon landing is a hoax articles. Now google (a CIA funded/guided project), who is well known for burying any truly subversive information it sees fit, to just let this <em>information</em> that totally undermines a huge part of science, and our national identity...they just let that shit roll right out. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>My family worked for NASA, I have photos from their missions. Believe me, you&#39;re not the only one who doesn&#39;t want to look at the evidence for some degree of manipulation in the Apollo program, because it is really rather painful to consider, and subconsciously we want to avoid that pain. A few thought experiments:</p>

<p>Why did Neil Armstrong become depressed and retreat from the world after returning from what should have been an profoundly personally rewarding mission?</p>

<p>Why does NASA now consider it impossible to land humans on the moon?</p>

<p>On topic...it is interesting that this Hicks/Jones fracas does tend to overshadow the Hicks message. This isn&#39;t entirely incompatible with the premises of the theory - both Hicks/Jones characters being acts and therefore both discardable for the actor, and - more in the speculative realm - Jones as mouthpiece.</p>

<p>No, <strong>you</strong> can’t.</p>

<p>The only equipment (allegedly) powerful enough to do so is under the exclusive control of a handful of observatories, all of which rely on government handouts to remain operational, all of which have a tiny handful of adequately skilled operators.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You gotta admit, their materials are extremely well made and convincing. If you had never been exposed to the history and science of it, it would be hard to put down. </p>

<p>And everyone forgets, the Russians, during the hot and furious beginning of the cold war, had their own competing moon landing program. They were pouring vast resources into this endeavor, the same as the US. Were they actually not ready to nuke us? Were the Russians actually <em>collaborating</em> with this massive conspiracy...to ahh, pretend the moon is real? Like why the fuck would they do that? What is the goal in the 1960&#39;s of convincing the world that the moon is real, and we landed on it? It is utterly retarded, and hides the REAL questions to me:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Why did we stop</p></li>
<li><p>Why did the Russians scrap the most expensive endeavor in history at the time? </p></li>
</ol>

<p>Because we went there, and we met something that told us &quot;don&#39;t come back&quot;. That is my pet theory anyhow. What happened to the 2 probes Russia sent to check out Phobos for that matter? Maybe the moon landing hoax theory is running cover for <em>other</em> conspiracies? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re right up my alley, Bud. </p>

<p>I&#39;ve always believe the latter half of the 20th Century was roughly hammered out at Yalta - the Cold War was a Hegelian ruse of both powers, for money [&amp; loosh] and world domination. I still think think the same premise is<a href="http://www.texemarrs.com/images/bush_putin_hu.jpg"> at play</a>, with China, Rockefeller&#39;s jewel, coming into play as the next economic powerhouse/frontier. </p>

<p>I was heartbroken when Apollo never amounted to anything, and Skylab turned out to be a joke. By then, it was obvious it was just a show. By the time the Vikings produced &#39;no results&#39; for life on Mars, I was 100% convinced it had all been a lie. I didn&#39;t get into the histories of the earlier, and later, US and Russian Mars missions until the &#39;90&#39;s. What? 72 failures? Something like that. Mars holds the key for the foundation of life on Earth - and the Moon points straight to Mars. That&#39;s why both places are out of reach. [I&#39;m open to the reality of being warned off, but I don&#39;t have any info on that that you, or anybody, doesn&#39;t.]</p>

<p>I&#39;m a believer in early NACA/USAF missions throughout the solar system &amp; beyond during the Ike years. I think that program specifically had a lot to do with Ike&#39;s MIC speech.</p>

As a side note I was once told that Alex Jones parents were tripping on LSD when he was conceived, by someone close to him (and Hicks)... at the same meeting I explained that Jones seemed to have taken off where Bill left, just without the humour, the person in question then went on to explain how much he missed his friend Bill.
Seriously, anyone who considers Jones as Hicks is not using sound logic and I can only assume is a paid shill or naive beyond belief... and for the poor shill who keeps wanting proof that Jones is NOT Hicks, dude, its impossible to prove a negative. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Are you serious? It’s totally possible to prove Jones isn’t Hicks. The family of Hicks could have published and verified his death certificate. We could have seen their separate brith certificates. We could have seen unearthed photos of them together. You have all this evidence that they are the same guy and NONE that they are not. I can prove that George Bush and John Kerry aren’t the same person, obviously. Would you still say it’s impossible to prove a negative? Think. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The OP argument makes no sense to me.  Saying that Alex Jones is Bill Hicks does nothing to delegitimize criticism of Alex, virtually any criticism of Alex is just as valid regardless of whether or not he was once known as Bill Hicks.  Conversely, commenting on Bill Hicks videos that he is now Alex Jones doesn&#39;t delegitimize any point he may have made. </p>

<p>Whether or not Alex and Bill are the same person is ultimately irrelevant when evaluating their words and opinions. </p>

<p>Anyway, I really enjoy Bill Hicks and dislike Alex Jones, but I think when you look at the evidence it&#39;s impossible to completely dismiss it.  I went down this rabbit hole about a year ago, and while I was extremely skeptical at first, after looking at all the evidence I would say there is above 50% chance that Alex is Bill.  What are the chances of having identical teeth, identical hairline, same best friend, same production company, same interests, similar mannerisms, similar body-type, similar anti-establishment views... etc.  </p>

And that&#39;s not taking into account Jones&#39;s CIA connections and all the other &quot;coincidences.&quot; In other words I respectfully would say there&#39;s way above a 50% chance.</p>

<p>Its mind boggling to me that (allegedly) during the same time period they lived in the same area,  had the same best friend,  worked for the same tiny company, and performed stand-up at the same clubs... yet according to Alex they never met eachother (and as you say there is no photo of them together).  My best friend and I are both comedy enthusiasts and we have both performed at local open mics in the past,  and if my best friend had another close friend who was a big into stand-up I DEFINITELY would have met this person at one point or another.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is reminiscent of the Sandy threads when there&#39;s always someone whose brother&#39;s roommate&#39;s nephew was there and saw everything so it must have been real. Rockets were really built and flown in the air, they just never went to space. Astronauts are real people you can meet, they just don&#39;t go to space. Their artists are always busy making pictures from missions, but they&#39;re just artist&#39;s renditions. </p>

<p>No... Lol actually that&#39;s what you&#39;re doing with your sayitism. You brought it up. This is a thread about Bill Hicks=Alex Jones and in reality has little to do with either. Its mute. Not important. What is important is for a mod you do a biased job. You can have your opinions, but with just saying others are dumb for their beliefs, you bring nothing new to the table. Especially without sources.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My family worked for NASA, I have photos from their missions. Believe me, you&#39;re not the only one who doesn&#39;t want to look at the evidence for some degree of manipulation in the Apollo program, because it is really rather painful to consider, and subconsciously we want to avoid that pain. A few thought experiments:</p>

<p>Why did Neil Armstrong become depressed and retreat from the world after returning from what should have been an profoundly personally rewarding mission?</p>

<p>Why does NASA now consider it impossible to land humans on the moon?</p>

<p>On topic...it is interesting that this Hicks/Jones fracas does tend to overshadow the Hicks message. This isn&#39;t entirely incompatible with the premises of the theory - both Hicks/Jones characters being acts and therefore both discardable for the actor, and - more in the speculative realm - Jones as mouthpiece.</p>
