        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I recently started working at Ralph Lauren and as a new way to clock in and out of shifts/breaks, you put your fingerprint on this scanner thing, it then identifies you and saves your logging times and stuff.</p>

<p>I asked my manager if my print is stored in there (which it is), and asked if I had to do it and she said: &quot;Yea you have to, plus it&#39;s so much better and faster than passwords; you can easily forget those haha and if you want you can store all five fingerprints just in case!&quot;</p>

<p>Not sure if other retailers or firms collect employee biometrics but this shit makes me uncomfortable af.</p>

<p>In my experience, the most common brand used is Schlage produced by Allegion. The ones I’ve seen and used do not actually store an image of your hand. It takes a scan of your hand and creates a 9-byte numerical code as basically an authentication token to match your print.</p>

<p>I’m not an expert though.</p>
