    <div class="md"><p>Well. I&#39;m not that guy. But considering the government admitted to it years ago and said that they &quot;discontinued it&quot;; it&#39;s pretty obvious they are still using it.</p>

<p>Also, part of the original program involved sex abuse by high level officials so they could blackmail them into continued funding. Which is totally still par for the course.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I’ve kind of tuned out of popular media for a bit but if you go to vigilantcitizan.com and see all the celebs using occult signs or putting occult imagery in their videos, most of these celebs have “handlers” in hollywood occult societies who attempt to direct culture from behind the scenes. </p>

<p>Mark Zuckerberg is an example, this gizmodo article is just scratching the surface. </p>

<p><a href="https://gizmodo.com/mark-zuckerberg-is-still-pissed-that-we-know-about-his-1818618102">https://gizmodo.com/mark-zuckerberg-is-still-pissed-that-we-know-about-his-1818618102</a></p>

<p>Kanye was forcibly taken to a hospital a couple years ago after going on a rant at a concert, recently hes been saying he is out of the “sunken place”, a reference to hypnotism mind control in Jordan Peeles movie Get Out.</p>

<p>Its less politicians because they are usually controlled through blackmail.</p>

<p>The idea is either to control n unruly celeb or to use hypnotic suggestion in big stars to influence basically everything.</p>

How do replies to posts like this change over time, if at all, specifically in relation to media and search engine manipulation, TMoR activities, shill tactics, censorship, etc.  This would be a bit of data that would be useful, and only able to be obtained from such posts and activity.  “Yes Mr. Investor or Government lackey, we still have control over our pied piper website, evident from datasheet A.”</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ll second Vegas. Fuck the people saying no one died or it didn&#39;t happen or any of that bullshit, but Lombardo&#39;s sketchy ass definitely covered something up. </p>

<p>It happened, people did die, and Vegas was changed (honestly? Probably for the better... We have a sense of community now) because of it. But it wasn&#39;t some lone wolf old dude that did it. There was far too much prep, he shot at fuel tanks he should have known wouldn&#39;t explode from gunshots, and brought way more guns than one person could ever dream of shooting. And had an exit strategy. </p>

<p>The most likely case, imo given the evidence, is that it was supposed to be a much bigger event and his cohorts dipped out at the last minute. That&#39;s why he had so many guns, that&#39;s why he shot at the fuel tanks, that&#39;s why there was a car with explosives in the parking garage, that&#39;s why there was a couple going around the festival saying &quot;You&#39;re all going to die tonight&quot;. More people were supposed to show up/be involved. Someone was supposed to move the car, someone was supposed to be in the second room providing a secondary source of fire and for whatever reason they either didn&#39;t or couldn&#39;t show up. </p>

<p>The failure of Vegas to be as horrible as it was supposed to be was one of the signs that the good guys are very well on to the bad guys&#39; tricks. </p>

<p>They <em>definitely</em> were supposed to blow up those gas tanks. Same way 9/11 could&#39;ve been a lot worse if those trucks with bombs took out the GW Bridge and maybe others.</p>

<p>Seems a bit of a knee-jerk reaction to claim the entire Earth isn&#39;t a sphere because of one coincidence.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>okok, i can explain..:  during the eclipses the sun is covered by the moon, this is possible even though the sun is huge, supposedly because the sun is exactly at the right distance to look the same size and be blocked.  400 times larger and at the same time 400 times further away in space. which is not true.</p>

<p>I would also say that it probably seems more coincidental to you because you&#39;re focusing so heavily on it, so I understand how you think it&#39;s a wierd fact however nowhere near enough to convince me the Earth is flat.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s to hide the greatest physical evidence of God which the flat enclosed cosmology we are in.  TPTB (Luciferian Eltie) don&#39;t want you to know that the narrative of God putting on the flesh of Jesus Christ who laid down his life and allowed his blood to be shed as a final sacrifice to atone for your sins is true.  They don&#39;t want you to realize this because if they can deceive you your entire life and you die without ever believing you are a sinner in need of the atonement of Jesus Christ then you will burn in an eternal like of fire with Lucifer and his fallen angels/devils.  That&#39;s +1 eternal soul that could have been a child of God that Lucifer was able to deceive into suffering the second (spiritual) death.</p>

<p>The King James Bible explains it all.  The kingdoms of this world are influenced spiritually by Lucifer and his principalities and powers.  These are a spiritual unseen government that can be communicated with via sorcery (pharmakeia: DMT, ayahuasca etc) and witchraft (occult ritual, mediation, astral projection etc).  He puts people into positions of power all over the world in all institutions who are willing to deceive for temporal power.  The reason they lie about this is to try to discredit the Biblical narrative of creation.  If they can get people to believe the foundation of the Bible is either wrong (create atheists and agnostics) or metaphorical (create false doctrine due to not knowing what is metaphor and what isn&#39;t) they can get more people to die in their sins without believing the gospel which is:</p>

<p>1Co 15:1  Moreover, brethren, I declare unto you the gospel which I preached unto you, which also ye have received, and wherein ye stand; 
1Co 15:2  By which also ye are saved, if ye keep in memory what I preached unto you, unless ye have believed in vain. 
1Co 15:3  For I delivered unto you first of all that which I also received, how that Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures; 
1Co 15:4  And that he was buried, and that he rose again the third day according to the scriptures: </p>

<p>It&#39;s as simple as repenting of everything you currently believe and believing the above gospel (you are a sinner that is saved by the grace of God through belief in the death, burial, and resurrection of Jesus Christ as a final sacrifice for your sins).  If you do that you can be saved by the grace of God.   They lie and create all the false religions to make you think it&#39;s something that can be earned.  &quot;outer space&quot; creates so many false new age religions involving the universe or alien seeding.  Aliens are just fallen angels.  Once you understand this fundamental lie you can cut out so many red herrings.</p>

People are coming to a saving faith in Jesus Christ in droves due to this truth being reviled in this later times: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL9ucTHJx18&amp;amp;list=PLykEf23rbpPOn7oqafzXqj3-h3WLHLUVc">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL9ucTHJx18&amp;list=PLykEf23rbpPOn7oqafzXqj3-h3WLHLUVc</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think MLB is less likely fixed for two reasons:</p>

<p>The players union is stronger than any other sport</p>

<p>The players make more, on average, than any other sport</p>

<p>Of course, there were <em>other</em> ways MLB is <em>corrupt</em>, but not necessarily fixed: Looking the other way on steroids, letting some criminal players get away with more than others, umpires blowing close calls to keep a game close, low budget teams like the Marlins or Padres trading away star players to big budget teams because they put profit ahead of winning, etc. </p>

<p>In the NBA, refs have been caught shaving points. You could probably find two dozen NBA playoff games that look shady still. NFL&#39;s refs are notorious for their player-favoring. </p>

<p>I&#39;m open to the idea that MLB is fixed, certainly could be done. But baseball&#39;s free agency suggests a guy has the ability to maximize his value by playing his best. NBA only has that in a limited sense and NFL not at all. </p>

<p>Thanks for your comment!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>NFL fixed...I&#39;ve been saying that for years!</p>

<p>I could list sooo many examples:  Donald Driver&#39;s last TD reception and NO Lambeau Leap and NO smile.  That catch put them within a score of being in the Superbowl with plenty of time on the clock and he just walks to the bench and sits down.    Then the first SB between the NYG and NE, there was only one flag thrown against the Giants and that was a blatant pass interference against Randy Moss in the end zone.  And the refs hesitated throwing it--they looked at each other first and kind of shrugged, as if to say, &quot;Well shit, we have to call that one.&quot;  That whole SB was as blatantly fixed as a game can be.  I could go on, but it would take all day.</p>

<p>Are there any good threads on here that discuss this?</p>
