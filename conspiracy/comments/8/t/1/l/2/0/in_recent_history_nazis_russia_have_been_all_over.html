<p>Is someone a sociopath because they feel they have no moral obligation to help someone who wishes to end their own life?  I’m more interested in why people think that could possibly make someone a sociopath?  We are debating morals here.  We dont all live by the same moral code.  I dont hope &amp; pray for bad things to happen i acknowledge that bad things will happen regardless.  Sometimes when people think they are doing what is right they make bigger problems.</p>

<p>Those atrocities had huge approval rating on both sides.  No need in blaming the deep state when the surface state is lying us into war or bombing for terrorists.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Nice fallacy buddy. But I&#39;ll still try to explain it to you.. just because other countries do something doesn&#39;t mean that other countries who also do it are completely innocent. The United states has fucked Latin America up so much and in so many different ways that it&#39;s no wonder they are still having a hard time recovering. There are tons of books and docs out about all the bullshit we pulled too if your ever curious about it. Like how we fucked El Salvador.. or how we fucked Honduras.. or how we fucked Venezuela.. this list of countries that we&#39;ve royally fucked in more ways than one goes on and on.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Back in ‘65 the US (military) invaded the country I was born in to overthrow the democratically elected president because they perceived him to be sympathetic to “communists”. His winning the election came after a 30 year dictatorship by a US puppet and his cronies. They then installed one of the dictator’s apprentices who ruled for 12 years with an iron fist of murder, fear and control, same as his teacher before him. Secret police “disappearing” people in the middle of the night,  torture, fear of assembly, neighbors ratting on each other journalists violently killed for publishing articles critical of the rulers. This happened time and time again in Latin American countries. It still happens today, only now it’s in the Middle East. </p>

<p>Have outside nations enabled bad actors?  Of course.  It has always been that way.  It&#39;s true even in the United States.</p>

<p>However, those bad actors don&#39;t spontaneously materialize.</p>
