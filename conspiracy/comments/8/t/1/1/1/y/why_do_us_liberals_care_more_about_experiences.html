<p>Cause numerous indictments mean nothing. All the intel agencies and US departments have admitted Russia had meddled in the election to the benefit of Trump. </p>

<ul>
<li>Also Mattis said that DPRK hasn&#39;t done anything to dismantle its weapons program. Also Trump has kept lying about the success of the DPRK issue, so far all we&#39;ve done is give them concessions for nothing. </li>
</ul>

<p>And Trump confirmed that he had stormy daniels paid off and it is established that he definitely fucked her. How has none of this been working. </p>

<p>Also that &quot;democrats need illegals for votes&quot; has never been proven and is consistently been debunked. What evidence shows any illegals voted in the 2016 election?</p>

<p>Your incorrect. It was described to DTJr as coming from the crown prosecutor (there is no such thing as a &quot;crown prosecutor&quot; in Russia).  </p>

<p>Uh-huh ok. Why did the President need to dictate a response for Jr. then after new of this broke and why did he lie about it.

<p>A Russian man that offered to sell damaging information on Hillary Clinton to the campaign of then-candidate Donald Trump revealed in earlier court documents that he had been a long-time FBI informant.

<p>Which is why Mueller won&#39;t investigate or question her:</p>

<p>Both &quot;Russian meetings&quot; were Shadow Gov Setups. Roger Stone even admitted that he new it was Feds playing games so he turned down the Greenburg meeting, and Mueller won&#39;t question either of the informants.</p>

<p>Sure less illegal immigrants could help, but it doesn&#39;t solve the fundamental problem with crime that&#39;s obvious to any educated person: economic inequality.

<p>From the study cited:</p>

<p>While crime

national 
averages (see

part

this is 
due

Crime

<p>Poor black urban areas are going to have higher rates of crime than poor rural areas, either white or black.   </p>

<p>That is because they are poor and urban, not because they are black. </p>

<p>As the population increases, whether it be by illegals or natural citizens as my 3 sources show, &#39;more&#39; laws get broken.  So if OP is concerned about &#39;more&#39; crime, is he also for a 1- or 2-child policy and against for-profit prisons?  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;But we can get even more specific about the impact of the 1981 cut in rates. A Treasury Department study on the impact of tax bills since 1940, first released in 2006 and later updated, found that the 1981 tax cut reduced revenues by $208 billion in its first four years. (These figures are rendered in constant 2012 dollars.) The tax reform act of 1986, which was designed to be revenue neutral, reduced revenues by less than $1 billion four years after enactment.</p>

<p>But Reagan’s tax increases in 1982, 1983, 1984 and 1987 boosted revenue by $137 billion. Overall, that’s a revenue loss from Reagan’s various tax bills, but it also shows that Moore is crediting to Reagan’s tax cuts revenues generated by Reagan’s tax increases.&quot;  </p>

<p>hmmm... look at that... Trickle down economics not working again.  Hold this L kiddo, stay in school, and enjoy those tax cuts that don&#39;t benefit you!   </p>

<p>Here,  from Romans, since you&#39;ve clearly never actually cracked a bible:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>13 Let everyone be subject to the governing authorities, for there is no authority except that which God has established. The authorities that exist have been established by God. </p>

<p>2 Consequently, whoever rebels against the authority is rebelling against what God has instituted, and those who do so will bring judgment on themselves. </p>

<p>3 For rulers hold no terror for those who do right, but for those who do wrong. Do you want to be free from fear of the one in authority? Then do what is right and you will be commended. </p>

<p>4 For the one in authority is God’s servant for your good. But if you do wrong, be afraid, for rulers do not bear the sword for no reason. They are God’s servants, agents of wrath to bring punishment on the wrongdoer. </p>

<p>5 Therefore, it is necessary to submit to the authorities, not only because of possible punishment but also as a matter of conscience.</p>

<p>Surprise, surprise, right wing Christian quotes the Bible supporting right wing Christianity. A collection of writing where one can find a piece of writing defending any position one chooses.  Of course you go for the Pauline apostles, instead of the gospels. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>34 “Then the King will say to those on his right, ‘Come, you who are blessed by my Father; take your inheritance, the kingdom prepared for you since the creation of the world. 35 For I was hungry and you gave me something to eat, I was thirsty and you gave me something to drink, I was a stranger and you invited me in, 36 I needed clothes and you clothed me, I was sick and you looked after me, I was in prison and you came to visit me.’</p>

<p>37 “Then the righteous will answer him, ‘Lord, when did we see you hungry and feed you, or thirsty and give you something to drink? 38 When did we see you a stranger and invite you in, or needing clothes and clothe you? 39 When did we see you sick or in prison and go to visit you?’</p>

<p>40 “The King will reply, ‘Truly I tell you, whatever you did for one of the least of these brothers and sisters of mine, you did for me.’ </p>
</blockquote>

<p>You continue:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Take in strangers? Of course! Enable lawlessness and rebellion against the nation?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The first point, that should be obvious, is that there were not nation states in the modern since.  The second point, is that in Judaism, there is absolutely justification against imperial power. In your context that would be the Roman empire that Paul is a bootlicker for.  Third of all it is even rooted in Christianity, as Saint Augustine stated in, &quot;On Free Choice of the Will&quot;. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Surely we will not dream of calling these laws unjust – or rather,
not to call them “laws” at all, for a law that is not just does not seem to me to be a law.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Or his meditations on the nature of government in The City of God.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Justice being taken away, then, what are kingdoms but great robberies? For what are robberies themselves, but little kingdoms? The band itself is made up of men; it is ruled by the authority of a prince, it is knit together by the pact of the confederacy; the booty is divided by the law agreed on. If, by the admittance of abandoned men, this evil increases to such a degree that it holds places, fixes abodes, takes possession of cities, and subdues peoples, it assumes the more plainly the name of a kingdom, because the reality is now manifestly conferred on it, not by the removal of covetousness, but by the addition of impunity. Indeed, that was an apt and true reply which was given to Alexander the Great by a pirate who had been seized. For when that king had asked the man what he meant by keeping hostile possession of the sea, he answered with bold pride, “What thou meanest by seizing the whole earth; but because I do it with a petty ship, I am called a robber, whilst thou who doest it with a great fleet art styled an emperor.”</p>

<p>Well actually it is not, and this understanding is a fairly late newcomer to the scene, and is usually subscribed to by fundamentalist Protestants.   Christianity, in the ancient world, referred to followers of a new Jewish sect which expanded the benefactors of apocalyptic resolution to gentiles due to influence of Hellenistic philosophy.</p>

<p>I do actually recommend that people do read the bible for themselves, and they will quickly see that one of the themes that comes up again and again, is the injustice of earthly powers, and laws, and injunctions to rebellion.

<p>You do that alot it seems.  You should google the term &quot;pilpul&quot; sometime.  It&#39;s obnoxious and yet you practice it constantly. </p>

<blockquote>

<p>Posting wiki links about Barabbas is a pretty embarrassing (but not your first example) and blatant example of a gish gallop.  It&#39;s clear you&#39;re just trying to pad your responses at this point to distract from your lack of genuine substance.</p>

<p>The Bible, New Testament and Old make clear a Christian&#39;s requirement to obey the laws of governing authority.</p>

<p>Sure, you can find examples of troublesome authorities, but you will not find &quot;ignore the laws you don&#39;t like&quot; anywhere in the good book.</p>

<p>Here, let&#39;s repeat these texts again.  When you find an actual scripture that refutes these and lays out requirement that Christians enable lawlessness,  let me know.</p>

<p>Proverbs 28:4</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Those who forsake the law praise the wicked,</p>

<p>but those who keep the law strive against them.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And</p>

<p>Romans 13</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Let everyone be subject to the governing authorities, for there is no authority except that which God has established. The authorities that exist have been established by God.</p>

<p>2 Consequently, whoever rebels against the authority is rebelling against what God has instituted, and those who do so will bring judgment on themselves.</p>

<p>The Bible is an anthology of literature.  It is literally a library of works.  It contains plenty of false and the odios, and it should be obviously rejected.  It also contains many arguments over ethical and philosophical issues.  Some of them are good, some of them are bad.  Only fundamentalists think it is a unified whole... it isn&#39;t, nor is is some kind of intellectual virtue to defend it is a unified whole, it isn&#39;t.  Moving on.</p>

<p>Right like:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>That&#39;s how grazing a religion a la carte works.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I really have no interest in discussing how one should approach religion, because it is a non-sequitor.  </p>

<p>Let us actually articulate what the problem is.  The adherents of divine command theory of ethics have injunctions where foreigners are not to be abused, and taken care of.   That is a fact.  Therefore there is a moral responsibility towards non-citizens, which the OP denied.  You do not dispute this fact.  Rather, you wanted to re-frame it, as an obedience to authority, thereby justifying wretched treatment of immigrants on a basis that they violate governmental authority.  </p>

<p>You privileged  an alleged writing of Paul over the injunction in the Gospels and the numerous other places in the Bible. </p>

<p>When it was pointed out to you, that Christianity has a long tradition, of being critical of legalism you espouse, you double down on the Paul passage.  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Posting wiki links about Barabbas is a pretty embarrassing (but not your first example) and blatant example of a gish gallop.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Well, it actually served a twofold purpose.  The first was for you to notice the actual name, and see it framed in a positive way, and the second for you to pay attention to the scholars who argued about the fact that it was Jesus Barabbas, and that actually this is a story about Jesus Christ.  Who scholars view as a leader of an insurrection against the Romans...you know the governmental authority back in the day.  There is no embarrassment on my part. </p>

<p>Second of all it is not a &#39;Gish-Gallop&#39;, named after a fundamentalist like yourself, it consist of given many arguments in a timed setting which are often wrong.  The disadvantage is to the opponent who DOES NOT have time to answer all of them in the time allotted.  Now, I have not given you many arguments, nor is there a formal time limit. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>The Bible, New Testament and Old make clear a Christian&#39;s requirement to obey the laws of governing authority.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Of course it does nothing of the kind, especially the Old Testament which if filled with rulers providing injunctions which are constantly violated.  </p>

<p>Or when Peter and the apostles explicitly said not to do that.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>And when they had brought them, they set them before the council. And the high priest questioned them, 28 saying, “We strictly charged you not to teach in this name, yet here you have filled Jerusalem with your teaching, and you intend to bring this man&#39;s blood upon us.” 29 But Peter and the apostles answered, “We must obey God rather than men.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Acts 5</p>

<p>Which of course brings up the point that you ignored. One can find any position reflected in the Bible, and quote it.  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Sure, you can find examples of troublesome authorities, but you will not find &quot;ignore the laws you don&#39;t like&quot; anywhere in the good book.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And here is where my good Christian friend commits the trick.  It is not a question of not following laws one does not like, it is a question of not following laws WHICH ARE UNJUST. </p>

<p>Secondly, the bible provides injunctions to take care of foreigners. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Except that&#39;s not what he&#39;s doing there, so I&#39;m not really sure what you&#39;re on about. I guess you just thought it sounded good.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Except it is exactly what Paul is doing here, as he is undermining not only religious law, but also law of institutions, which in the Jewish faith was one the same.   You are familiar with the halakha? </p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halakha">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halakha</a></p>

<p>Paul is advocating lawlessness in a literal sense.  What do you think is the consequence of this in a territory ruled by Jewish law?   </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Most people only care about what the MSM tell them to care about.  Headlines are all they read.  They get most of their info from titles on frontpages of reddit or facebook feeds or twitter retweets.  They have no knowledge of the real world outside their homogeneous neighbourhood and don&#39;t deal with the crime, moral degeneracy and destruction of neighbourhoods and towns and cities by illegal immigrants.   The media does not mention crime and the government censors data by lumping Hispanics in with white crime stats.   A quick search of any police wanted list or suspects and youll see entire pages of &quot;white&quot; people that are clearly Hispanics and sometimes even arab/muslims.   </p>

<p>It&#39;s similar to black crime stats or gun stats - they don&#39;t tell people about them.  20+ people were shot at last week in a drive by in a black city.  No mass shooting or 24/7 news coverage.  No gun control calls.  Chicago has strictest gun laws in America and has thousands of shootings every year.  Not unusual for double digit kill counts on any given day.   No mass media coverage, no questioning gun laws or the violence and destruction of the city as the gangs take over more and more territory.   Literal no go zones at night if you are not in the gang for that area.   Almost all gun crime comes from like 20 counties - all in black dominated cities like Baltimore, Chicago, Atlanta, Detroit, etc.  Not a peep.  No one cares because the media didn&#39;t tell them to.   But a single white shooter is a week long event.   </p>

<p>Liberals are far more concerned with how virtuous they appear to everyone else.  Social justice is about upvotes and &quot;being on the right side of history&quot;, which is whatever the media tells them is right.   They didn&#39;t care about the border for the past 20 years, but they were told this week a holocaust was happening and Trump is hitler, so they magically care now.</p>

<p>As the population increases, whether it be by illegals or natural citizens as my 3 sources show, &#39;more&#39; laws get broken.  So if OP is concerned about &#39;more&#39; crime, is he also for a 1- or 2-child policy and against for-profit prisons?  </p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>Literally the only thing that proves is the long tradition (the one you carry on today) of people trying to pick and choose which pieces of the Bible make them feel good while rejecting the pieces that don&#39;t. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>The Bible is an anthology of literature.  It is literally a library of works.  It contains plenty of false and the odios, and it should be obviously rejected.  It also contains many arguments over ethical and philosophical issues.  Some of them are good, some of them are bad.  Only fundamentalists think it is a unified whole... it isn&#39;t, nor is is some kind of intellectual virtue to defend it is a unified whole, it isn&#39;t.  Moving on.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>And I&#39;m not &quot;espousing legalism.&quot; I saying, &quot;use your eyes and actually read what it says. It is in plain English.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Right like:</p>

<p>33 “‘When a foreigner resides among you in your land, do not mistreat them. 34 The foreigner residing among you must be treated as your native-born. Love them as yourself, for you were foreigners in Egypt. I am the Lord your God.</p>

<p>Leviticus.</p>

<p>But  keep on denying the obvious, and trying to defend the indefensible. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>No, that&#39;s very much not how Christianity works. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Here is some more &#39;pilpul&#39;,  it is very much how responsible readers take Christianity, it might not be how your fundamentalist cult does. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>That&#39;s how grazing a religion a la carte works.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I really have no interest in discussing how one should approach religion, because it is a non-sequitor.  </p>

<p>Let us actually articulate what the problem is.  The adherents of divine command theory of ethics have injunctions where foreigners are not to be abused, and taken care of.   That is a fact.  Therefore there is a moral responsibility towards non-citizens, which the OP denied.  You do not dispute this fact.  Rather, you wanted to re-frame it, as an obedience to authority, thereby justifying wretched treatment of immigrants on a basis that they violate governmental authority.  </p>

<p>You privileged  an alleged writing of Paul over the injunction in the Gospels and the numerous other places in the Bible. </p>

<p>When it was pointed out to you, that Christianity has a long tradition, of being critical of legalism you espouse, you double down on the Paul passage.  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Posting wiki links about Barabbas is a pretty embarrassing (but not your first example) and blatant example of a gish gallop.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Well, it actually served a twofold purpose.  The first was for you to notice the actual name, and see it framed in a positive way, and the second for you to pay attention to the scholars who argued about the fact that it was Jesus Barabbas, and that actually this is a story about Jesus Christ.  Who scholars view as a leader of an insurrection against the Romans...you know the governmental authority back in the day.  There is no embarrassment on my part. </p>

<p>Second of all it is not a &#39;Gish-Gallop&#39;, named after a fundamentalist like yourself, it consist of given many arguments in a timed setting which are often wrong.  The disadvantage is to the opponent who DOES NOT have time to answer all of them in the time allotted.  Now, I have not given you many arguments, nor is there a formal time limit. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>The Bible, New Testament and Old make clear a Christian&#39;s requirement to obey the laws of governing authority.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Of course it does nothing of the kind, especially the Old Testament which if filled with rulers providing injunctions which are constantly violated.  </p>

<p>Or when Peter and the apostles explicitly said not to do that.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>And when they had brought them, they set them before the council. And the high priest questioned them, 28 saying, “We strictly charged you not to teach in this name, yet here you have filled Jerusalem with your teaching, and you intend to bring this man&#39;s blood upon us.” 29 But Peter and the apostles answered, “We must obey God rather than men.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Acts 5</p>

<p>Which of course brings up the point that you ignored. One can find any position reflected in the Bible, and quote it.  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Sure, you can find examples of troublesome authorities, but you will not find &quot;ignore the laws you don&#39;t like&quot; anywhere in the good book.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And here is where my good Christian friend commits the trick.  It is not a question of not following laws one does not like, it is a question of not following laws WHICH ARE UNJUST. </p>

<p>Secondly, the bible provides injunctions to take care of foreigners. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Except that&#39;s not what he&#39;s doing there, so I&#39;m not really sure what you&#39;re on about. I guess you just thought it sounded good.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Except it is exactly what Paul is doing here, as he is undermining not only religious law, but also law of institutions, which in the Jewish faith was one the same.   You are familiar with the halakha? </p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halakha">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halakha</a></p>

<p>Paul is advocating lawlessness in a literal sense.  What do you think is the consequence of this in a territory ruled by Jewish law?   </p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;But we can get even more specific about the impact of the 1981 cut in rates. A Treasury Department study on the impact of tax bills since 1940, first released in 2006 and later updated, found that the 1981 tax cut reduced revenues by $208 billion in its first four years. (These figures are rendered in constant 2012 dollars.) The tax reform act of 1986, which was designed to be revenue neutral, reduced revenues by less than $1 billion four years after enactment.</p>

<p>But Reagan’s tax increases in 1982, 1983, 1984 and 1987 boosted revenue by $137 billion. Overall, that’s a revenue loss from Reagan’s various tax bills, but it also shows that Moore is crediting to Reagan’s tax cuts revenues generated by Reagan’s tax increases.&quot;  </p>

<p>hmmm... look at that... Trickle down economics not working again.  Hold this L kiddo, stay in school, and enjoy those tax cuts that don&#39;t benefit you!   </p>
