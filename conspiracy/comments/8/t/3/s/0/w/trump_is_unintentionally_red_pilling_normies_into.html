They&#39;re beholden to the same interests and act as figureheads or spokesmen for international corporations and the military-industrial complex. He&#39;s filling his cabinet with swamp people, making backwards deals/legislation for the super-wealthy that hurt the lower/middle classes, he&#39;s working with foreign actors to strengthen his own gains for power, etc. </p>

<p>I mega-loathe Trump but this may actually be a good thing because the widespread view of how corrupt everything is can awaken people from their indifferent slumber. The only problem left is people assuming it&#39;s Republicans vs. Democrats. Still is two wings of the same bird with the same agenda; staying in power, making money. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Im not saying im a trump supporter or i like the guy but this sub overlooks the fact that he indeed is red pilling citizens to things they would not have payed attention to or noticed in the past. I wont go so far as to saying he&#39;s playing 4D chess but almost everything he does seems to be undoing the work TPTB have had set up.
I think people chose to overlook them or say its coincidence because they want to hate him, because he says arrogant remarks or things people want to cry rascist. This society is soft now anything they dont like they try to remove or find faults with. </p>

<p>If you dare to claim that he might be doing it intentionally, you will get attacked and downvoted by our relatively new members of this sub. But it seems obvious to me that he is doing this intentionally, and that is why TPTB hate him so much.</p>

<p>If I were TPTB, I would have shills come onto subs like this to try to make sure nobody ever says anything nice about Trump, and to keep people divided as much as possible.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Personally, I just think that propaganda is very effective. These people don&#39;t want to believe that their thoughts and opinions are the byproduct of propaganda in the mainstream media, but that is what it is. I was that way once, too, so I realize how potent it can be.</p>

<p>If you control the press, you can control what a huge portion of the population thinks and believes, and you can manipulate them to serve your interests. I think that is exactly what has been happening for a long time now, and it is probably the biggest flaw in Democracy.</p>

Here&#39;s the arrests in 2017 and 2018.  Each incident has it&#39;s proper sourcing (via the web addresses).
