        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>To my conspiracy theorist friends, how do you think the elite plan to lower the population?</p>

<p>It&#39;s obvious they&#39;re working a soft kill program, via cancer enzymes in vaccines, ineffective pharmaceuticals that cause more harm than good, and sterilization chemicals in our food and hygiene products, but it&#39;s obvious that they&#39;re planning a hard kill soon (at least to me).  What do you think they&#39;re planning?</p>

<p>I&#39;m tossed up.  Seems like the evidence is pointing to either a disease/pandemic.  That or a War of the World style attack using advanced technology but blamed on aliens.  They&#39;ve been working the alien attack angle for a while, with the fake moon landing, fake leaked area 51 documents, etc.  (Alien attack being a good way to create a world government, as even people who hate each other are easily united with a common enemy)</p>

<p>I know many of my friends believe there really are aliens, and I&#39;m not saying it&#39;s impossible, but I lean towards the beings that have been contacted as spirits or demons (considering most of the communication has come from channeling).</p>

<p>Anyone else got a theory?</p>

<p>PS, if you are an actual conspiracy theorist, will you PLEASE UPVOTE ME to help balance out the massive amount of downvotes I will receive from the anti-conspiracy shills?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t see why people wanting to have less kids is seen as a bad thing. Once society has stable resources, shelter, etc. and is largely conflict-free, there is no need for so many children. When people have vices and entertainment, sex is less necessary as one as well. This all leads to a natural decline in birthrate and a stabilization of population. </p>

<p>That&#39;s not inherently a bad thing; in many cases it can be a good thing.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Upvoted. Good thread. Not sure which is most likely be I do think depopulation is the name of the game. The new Avengers movie was so bizarre. It was like watching their agenda play out. Regarding Blue Beam, it seems that so many people are aware of it now and are really pushing back against the alien narrative. My concern with that is they have to “win” so if Blue Beam is executed I think it’ll be absolutely devastating. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Agreed.  I think whatever forces are writing these scripts have probably taken note of the pushback against the alien agenda.  </p>

<p>It&#39;s funny though, it really seems they shot themselves in the foot by choosing Tom DeLonge to &quot;lead&quot; their brand of false disclosure.  Perhaps they thought his voice would resonate with the Millennial generation, but it seems to have not worked out exactly as they planned.  </p>

<p>Contrast that with getting a public media entertainment figure like NDT or Bill Nye to spearhead the movement, and the results would&#39;ve likely been entirely different.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Knowledge is power friend. </p>

<p>William Cooper offers a lengthy analysis of the state of global events, presenting information, which he claims is secretly held by governments. Cooper argues that numerous secret societies exist, which were organized into a single massive society c. 1953; that a Secret Government, which controls everything, was established shortly after World War II; that the government seeks to eliminate population through various means and that extra-terrestrial intelligent life exists and often visits earth. In addition, Cooper offers auto-biographical information and proffers a plethora of putative facts regarding the massive and systematic disinformation campaign waged upon the public by those in power.</p>

<p>The text is comprised of materials from a variety of source; much of the contents are facsimile reproductions of disparate documents including letters, articles from newspapers and magazines, declassified government documents, legal proceedings, public documents and photographs. In addition, the text contains several, lengthy articles written at various times by Cooper; many of these articles were originally printed elsewhere, and some of them are addresses delivered to various groups. All of these various materials are presented with additional up-to-date commentary by Cooper. The arrangement of the text is confused, however, and much of the material presented appears largely or wholly irrelevant to the text&#39;s principle themes. The bulk of Cooper&#39;s textual theses are found in Chapters 2 and 12, while Chapters 5 and 9 supply tangential information. Most of the remaining chapters present documents that are largely unrelated or unimportant. The foreword presents autobiographical information about Cooper and is probably the most lucid segment of the text.</p>

<p>In brief, Cooper&#39;s thesis appears to be that shortly after World War II, the United States government established a Secret Government, which persists until the present time. The Secret Government is the actual controlling power of global politics and has the single goal of establishing a global, totalitarian socialist state—a modified version of Nazi Germany&#39;s Fascism. Since time immemorial, various secret societies have existed; they are all based upon the worship of the Biblical Lucifer, and the members of these societies seek personal knowledge or illumination—hence they are collectively referred to as the Illuminati. After World War II, all of the disparate secret societies were brought together in a single organizational structure known as the Bilderberg Group. The exact nature of the relationship between the Bilderberg Group and the Secret Government is difficult and obscure; the fact, however, is that both groups have similar goals and strategies and both groups are heavily infiltrated by members of the other group. In most of the text, Cooper seems to suggest that the two groups are, in fact, the same organization. Finally, the existence of UFOs and alien life forms was established shortly after World War II. Realizing that such knowledge would cause widespread panic the government decided to keep it secret. Vast networks of bases and entire organizations of personnel were subsequently organized to contain the alien situation, and political treaties were signed with alien nations. Today, the Secret Government seeks to dominate the alien presence and carry out its secret program of world domination.</p>

<p>In brief, the text is incredible, the many allegations undocumented, and the constant vituperation of public officials is offensive. For example, Cooper denigrates Pope John Paul II as a Nazi poison-gas salesman, who helped engineer HIV and deliberately distributed the virus in vaccinations. All of this is confounded by a confused textual development and seriously hampered by the haphazard compilation of the book. Finally, the total lack of credible supporting documentation or other evidence leads to the inescapable conclusion that the book is a hate-inspired and inflammatory work of ignorable fiction, designed to arouse fear and spread hatred.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The depopulation idea always seemed weird to me. If you were a farmer, would you slaughter half your cattle when you could profit off of them? If someone is in power and in a corporate position, they make their money, their safety net, through the labors of others. So why would the want to depopulate? It&#39;d be one thing if we were running out of space, but I&#39;m sure those in charge could easily force others into more compact spaces if they need to, as long as they can keep their profit margins</p>

<p>We didn&#39;t really have much good information on how radiation from cell phones and towers affects us afaik. There was a study published not long ago (preliminary reports first came out in 2016) which exposed rats to high levels of 2G &amp; 3G for a couple of years and the male rats had a higher incidence of tumours. But they weren&#39;t sure why and couldn&#39;t extrapolate that to humans. If you check any of the clickbait 5G panic stories on you&#39;ll eventually figure out that they&#39;re basing the fear porn on this from what I&#39;ve seen.</p>

<p>There are different kinds of saturated fats, each having different effects on our body.  Which kind do you think are &quot;good for health&quot;?</p>

<p>Do you have any research to back that up?</p>

<p>For example stearic acid is a saturated fat that has not been found to have negative health effects.  This isn&#39;t the case though for other types of saturated fats.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.bmj.com/content/355/bmj.i5796">https://www.bmj.com/content/355/bmj.i5796</a></p>

<p>Conclusions Higher dietary intakes of major SFAs are associated with an increased risk of coronary heart disease. Owing to similar associations and high correlations among individual SFAs, dietary recommendations for the prevention of coronary heart disease should continue to focus on replacing total saturated fat with more healthy sources of energy.</p>

<p>Saturated fats are not associated with all cause mortality, CVD, CHD, ischemic stroke, or type 2 diabetes, but the evidence is heterogeneous with methodological limitations. Trans fats are associated with all cause mortality, total CHD, and CHD mortality, probably because of higher levels of intake of industrial trans fats than ruminant trans fats.</p>

<p>The resulting article published in 1967 concluded there was &quot;no doubt&quot; that reducing cholesterol and saturated fat was the only dietary intervention needed to prevent heart disease. The researchers overstated the consistency of the literature on fat and cholesterol, while downplaying studies on sugar, according to the analysis.</p>

<p>They overstated one source and downplayed another.  This doesn&#39;t imply that cholesterol or saturated fats are healthy.</p>

<p>&quot;Saturated fatty acids raise total and low-density lipoprotein (LDL)
cholesterol, but individual fatty acids within this group, have different effects (3--5). Myristic and palmitic acids have the greatest effect and are abundant in diets rich in dairy products and meat. Stearic acid has not been shown to elevate blood cholesterol and is rapidly converted to oleic acid in vivo. The most effective replacement for saturated fatty acids in terms of coronary heart disease outcome are polyunsaturated fatty acids, especially linoleic acid. This finding is supported by the results of several large randomized clinical trials, in which replacement of saturated and trans fatty acids by polyunsaturated vegetable oils lowered coronary
heart disease risk (6).&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It’s more than just obesity. Excess sugar (and it does not take all that much) causes yeast to proliferate in the intestines leading to many of the chronic illnesses Americans experience. Alcohol consumption thrown in makes it worse. Same goes for antibiotics. When your gut flora gets wonky, it leads to things like depression (because the body can no longer convert l-tryptophan to 5-HTP, a serotonin precursor), IBS, h. Pylori and C. Diff infections, wide spread chronic inflammation (leads to way higher risk of heart disease), food sensitivities due to increased intestinal permeability, and many other chronic illnesses. </p>

<p>Our gut flora is messed up as an entire country. Western society has way less biodiversity in probiotics compared to the rest of the world and gut flora has a big impact on what benefits you can get out of the food you consume (Americans on average have less than 1% of the probiotic strain that is needed to break fiber down into key omega fatty acids). Probiotics also affect mood. </p>

<p>Also, there are some researchers with federal grants working on increasing probiotic diversity in kids diagnosed with Autism. They are seeing a 25% reduction in symptoms after treating kids. </p>

<p>All that being said, I still can’t cut back my sugar intake as much as I should for any sustained period of time. :/</p>

But if Israel joins then I&#39;m sure a few other countries would back Iran just because.  Maybe Russia backs Iran then we have another problem and ask other countries to join us.

<p>In fact the history of the biological warfare can be traced way back to 600 BC when the Assyrians supposedly used a<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ergot">fungus</a> as a weapon.</p>

<p>The bomb I used to hear about as a kid was some variation of the neutron bomb, that &quot;vaporizes people without destroying cities&quot;. Later Ive discovered that - actually - the neutron bomb is just an atomic bomb that is tuned to spread more lethal radiation.</p>

<p>I&#39;m convinced they want all the remaining population to be in megacities for control purposes, so whatever they do has to effectively take care of the rural folk, not only to get rid of their resistance, but also to be able to take their land. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It don&#39;t think it would be a hard kill as that would effect them as well, wouldn&#39;t be a general population culling.  The elites would (likely) look to remove specific global demographic.  Large scale wars would kill indiscriminate.  Nuking a city kills the well off as well as the &quot;dregs&quot;.  Not really an option.<br/>
Kind of a combination of the (good comments) below.<br/>
EBT:  There is no government checking account for food stamps.  The program is run by very large financial institutions.  This applies to both federal, state and local programs.   If you subscribe (as I do) that society is only 3 meals from anarchy, all it takes is a prolonged IT outage of that programs.  40 million people with no access to food with none stored.  Inner cities would begin to rip themselves apart in a day or two.  This would also significantly impact supply lines making the problem exponentially worse as time went on.  You think the Walmart guy/gal making $10/hour is going to try and maintain some order?     </p>

<p>Technology(example): An implant is developed that increases the intelligence of an individual exponentially.  It costs $3,000,000 cash.  You can let your mind run wild on this one, the societal damage would lead to all sorts societal disasters.  Again, targeted demographic.  In a few years, anyone that didn&#39;t have the means to participate would most likely eat themselves alive.    </p>

<p>As far as a general culling.  The most efficient way (not my idea, can&#39;t remember book) wouldn&#39;t be a plague type virus, my guess it would be a genetically targeted sterility virus.  Say, every female with brown eyes becomes sterile.  That would wipe out a huge amount of the population including the eradication of most third would countries in a (wrong word i&#39;m sure) &quot;orderly&quot; fashion over a decade or two.<br/>
Power grid is the obvious low hanging fruit, but that would be localized to specific areas/countries.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>People don&#39;t seem to get that suffering is a huge part of what they want. Sure they want to reduce the population but us suffering is key. I have always said this can&#39;t be for money, because we would print it, it&#39;s not for oil because we would take it and it&#39;s not for land because again we would take it. So then what is all this violence and confusion for? Energy.</p>

<p>The years leading up to the 2012 Olympics people were certain something was going down. From the Illuminati symbolism in the actual stadium to the pyramid (the shard) that was erected to the mascots with cameras for eyes and even the streets all around the stadium have biblical roots. Something was going to happen but it never did. Except something did happen, they created fear and confusion. They didn&#39;t stifle the conspiracies they played to them, they had anti air missiles on roof tops around London ffs. Then they held massive parties in the streets around the stadium for the duration of the games. Energy. There are powers at work that we can&#39;t even begin to comprehend, and that maybe don&#39;t even exist. I fully believe that the elite believe in God, but they worship Satan. That&#39;s why all of this seems really fucked up and confusing like pedogate, it&#39;s satanic rituals and satanic ritualistic sacrifices are based in pain and suffering first and death last, see Crowley.</p>

<p>If they don&#39;t exists then... they aren&#39;t at work either? Contradiction principle?</p>

<p>Also where is God in this theory? people always seem to know where is satan, what is doing and those who worship him. So, where is god? what is he doing if anything at all? and who actually worship him?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I mean as in power like god, who they believe exists but might not. If they are Satanists they are Christians because they believe in Satan, God created Satan and that&#39;s where god is. God wouldn&#39;t intervene either because why would he? We are the angels that fell with Satan, we made our choice but we have one last chance, ignorance. That&#39;s what being born into sin means, the sin happened but now we sit as the jury in the greatest trail of all time, god vs Satan. God gives us nothing, Satan offers money and power in this life here and now. You can see why choices are made. This is of course religiously speaking.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So you are saying that this world is entirely ruled by satan, as we fell in here because our sins. If God won&#39;t intervene means that doesn&#39;t matter how &quot;good&quot; or faithful to God you are, nothing good shall happen to you until the day of your death, because it&#39;s when the trial ends. It&#39;s curious that only satan is able to demonstrate it&#39;s existence, to offer and to rule; meanwhile we should believe in God that lacks presence, offers or ruling.</p>

<p>I think in this theory we should only aim to die faster because subjectively speaking as humanity, the only God in this world is Satan?</p>

<p>This theory looks very pessimistic and I rather not believe in such things. There should be another explanation.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not saying anything. I&#39;m going off what the original story was in terms of God and creation. I also never asserted that it doesn&#39;t matter if we do good or bad and it&#39;s disturbing you took that from it. We are born evil but with a choice. Now let me ask you something, is it better to be born good and just live a good person or is it better to make mistakes and learn and choose to be good simply for the sake of it? Not for gain like evil but for nothing, the purest form of giving. If you choose evil then get settled, you are staying. Want out? Live a good life.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t consider it disturbing, only logical to extrapolate that if Satan is the God in this world his will will prevail (therefore evil), as God won&#39;t intervene, rule or offer anything. I didn&#39;t say it would be different as in bad in the after life, but that the only logical reasoning for this world and this life.</p>

<p>I think that if God gives Satan free will, considering he&#39;s an exceptional being (as in powerful, over humanity), this is asymmetrical and doesn&#39;t archive harmony, because Satan possess a force that even controls or manipulate humanity according to some christian traditions, breaking the holy covenant of free will (possession and activities you suggested might be against people will). To me, God presence should be only equivalent, or otherwise existence in here is actually nothing more than an uncomfortable sentence, the definition of hell, and then what good should we expect if this is exactly was God intended (punishment)? What would be the purpose of the truth, besides the certainty of a life of suffering?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>And you think all of this because you have limited knowledge of Christianity. It seems like you are the pessemistic one, you are talking so defeated. Life is such a tiny aspect of existence and that&#39;s the point. If you look at eternity and think I have to suffer for 75 years and get an eternity of bliss as a reward for not being a bastard I think it&#39;s a pretty good pay off. You were dead long before you were alive and you managed that no problem. </p>

<p>Also I don&#39;t mourn death, I&#39;m happy the person I love is at peace. Death is not sad it is relief, the end of your shift and now you can swipe out and be happy, or miserable if you do the wrong thing and I don&#39;t mean the law i mean what is wrong and right to YOU.</p>

<p>It&#39;s hardly even spoken about, so I don&#39;t know how legitimate this concern is.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The thing is, they can&#39;t really get &quot;big kill&quot; events &quot;authorized&quot;</p>

<p>They still play by divine creators rules and if they plan something in regards to killing off mass population percentages, they get shut down fast either by creation itself or through white hats or other good people. This is intentional.</p>

<p>God would never let discriminate full scale killing take place, it has to be &quot;authorized&quot; by individuals at a soul level or a group or collective consciousness</p>

<p>This is why they&#39;ve resorted to soft kill methods. To get us sick, squeeze us of money, and get us depressed so we buy shit cheap food and more toxic bullshit to further dull the senses. There&#39;s so many avenues that in reality we are all killing ourselves off slowly without them even really having to do much.</p>

<p>Their big kill events can be theoretical and extensive in nature, but their actual happenings or motivations of pulling events are severely compromised and impacted by our friends in the skies and our brothers and sisters on the ground.</p>

<p>This is also discussed in a recent cosmic disclosure episode with Emery smith.</p>

<p>Just to get on topic, if they want to reduce the population, they&#39;ll start a global war as per usual. Reduces population and increases ingenuity.

I agree on the &quot;aliens&quot; being spirits/demons, because I firmly believe that we will evolve <em>spiritually</em> before we evolve <em>technologically</em>. What do you think of specific channelings? Like the Ra material, or Seth? Both of which I have learned tremendously important lessons but also feel that their material is dripping with misinfo.</p>

<p>I think some of the hard kills will come in the form of starvation from war and diseases. GMO kill-seeds will be involved in many places, and the blame will be put on resource distribution, not satanic science, as an excuse to build more global government infrastructure.</p>

<p>I think alien attack is the very last card they pull before they take off their sheep masks and reveal themselves as wolves. At least 40+ years down the road.</p>

<p>They purpose is not just to get humanity under a billion but to cause as much suffering as possible in the process to feed their demiurge.</p>
