    <div class="md"><p>Yeah but how could idoser be used to cause an instant effect. 
You say that forms of mental alteration exists in audio and visual mediums, could you explain that please. </p>

<p>Do you think it&#39;s one frequency or multiple frequencies? My issue is that I&#39;m having problems finding the right frequencies. Since sounds go through the inner ear and into auditory cortex, is there a way to use the sounds electrical impulses flowing into the auditory cortex to &quot;hijack&quot; the brain. </p>

<p>Scientists use optogenetics with light and genetic engineering. However sound can induce changes if tweaked properly but I&#39;m just stuck hear. Hopefully you have some feedback for my hypothesis </p>

    <div class="md"><p>We already have subconscious programming on television, images flashed too fast for your cognitive mind to catch but your subconscious remembers.</p>

<p>As for frequencies, I&#39;m no expert but I&#39;d hypothesize that in order to make more complex commands several different frequencies might be needed. Less for more simple commands.</p>

<p>As far as I know currently, nothing known to the public can achieve it <strong>instantly</strong>. Rather through drawn out subconscious manipulation, it&#39;s not too far off of the idea of MKULTRA brainwashing so I don&#39;t doubt the government may already have this ability. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah. So what I&#39;m getting at hear is a device similar to the neuralyzer from men in black, minus the memory erasing part but instead the following of commands after a light flash, in my case sounds and maybe even light frequencies. </p>

<p>There are some conspiracy theories I read about a Russian lida macine, Lilly wave and various other stuff relating to mind control, none of which tell me actual scientific data but moreso anecdotes. </p>

<p>Do you think it would take eternity to find the right frequencies considering how there can be millions of combinations of various frequency out there.</p>

<p>Do you think perhaps brain wave entrainment with not oy sound but light and sound could work? Light at 100hz and sound at 107hz, thereby a difference of 7 jx which is theta state. Binaural beats don&#39;t work effectively perhaps maybe this way could work, what do you think??</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, I believe it&#39;d take lifetimes to pinpoint the right frequencies without advanced technology, unless luck came into play.</p>

<p>I absolutely believe that light based programming is possible; even colors affect our emotions, this is very well known in business. </p>

<p>As a more specific example, McDonalds went with the Red/Yellow color scheme because something about those colors help to give the feeling of hunger to the customer. So I can absolutely believe it can go beyond that and affect other areas of the mind.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Most of the research is already done. The light and sound frequencies have been perfected and deployed and a free sample can be had by anyone. The one currently deployed adds the element of <em>ideas</em> as well, that is, suggestions, hypnotic suggestions while the lights and frequencies are projected. Where can you observe this device?
