        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>August Ames tweeted a warning to a colleague that the actor she was booked to work with used to do gay porn so she should be careful. </p>

<p>She was immediately viciously attacked on Twitter as being homophobic, threatening her, telling people not to work with her anymore and she ended up committing suicide.</p>

<p>Mission accomplished.</p>

<p>Less than a month later, there was an HIV breakout that shut the industry down for a week while everyone is retested.</p>

<p>Turns out, it was an actor who used to shoot gay porn. </p>

<p>It is almost always an actor who used to shoot gay porn or else it was an actress who’s boyfriend shoots gay porn.</p>

<p>It’s a fact. Facts can’t be homophobic.</p>

<p>August Ames was right to warn her friend and she was bullied to death.</p>

<p>SJW ideology is dangerous.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s an ideology that masquerades as social justice.</p>

<p>It is not a discussion of level headed individuals. They do not care about how you feel. They are demanding 100 percent compliance and nothing less.</p>

<p>If you give in to their demands (whatever they may be in that given moment) you are kneecapping yourself and your own views.</p>

<p>They see an apology or your forced compliance as a sign they need to keep pushing. There is no give and take.</p>

<p>There is only take. Take and destroy.</p>

<p>The individuals that do not share their views have been frightened into silence or forced into hushed compliance. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Generally I agree with you except that SJWs are largely authoritarian as well.  There is a lot of interfactional dispute among the left and sometimes it gets violent.</p>

<p>To answer your last question, it is because MOST communists believe in some sort of administrative bureau to allocate resources, guide work, and defend the Communist experiment against internal and external threats.  This is a State, regardless of what they call it.  Any State, regardless of its claimed ideological principles, is by default (and must be) a bourgeoisie class.</p>

<p>The problem here is that a Communist administrative bureau has no limits.  No checks and balances.  No boundaries.  It does not respect human rights.  Why would it?  You need to allocate the basic needs of humans and direct their work, and all those messy &quot;checks and balances&quot; really get in the way of efficient and effective administration.</p>

<p>So what you get is a new bourgeoisie with totally unlimited power.  The people running it have an unlimited capacity to gain personal wealth, and they do.  </p>

<p>If people actually understood Marxism, they would understand that in fact it is a prescription for anarchy.  However, most communists do not understand this.</p>

<p>Interestingly, Mussolini was a militant socialist before he became a socialist.  If you read his writings, the idea that birthed modern fascism was that the best way to achieve socialism is to throw out the class warfare stuff and just use government.  If you understand this, then it becomes clear that authoritarian communists are really just fascists.</p>

<p>Actual communism eliminates the State and is therefore not fascism.  But there aren&#39;t many anarcho-communists out there.</p>

<p>Statistics show that homosexuals are at MUCH higher risk of HIV infection. Not only that, you need to look into POZ culture in California, you know, where the majority of porn is filmed.</p>

<p>Now stop acting like the guy shit in your cereal, grow up and take 5 seconds to look something up and confirm it before proving your ignorance.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not sure why you got the downvotes, but yes, I totally see that.  In the US too.  NPR/PBS does the same thing, although they pull a &quot;long con&quot; for smarter people, more through omission of parts of stories (or of entire stories) rather than the shock method that CNN does.  It&#39;s because people who wish to control others are attracted to the apparatus that allows for control of the narrative/control of others: ergo: the &quot;news&quot; and government/teaching.   Exciting times.  I somewhat expect the urgency of power-grabbing to increase.  Check out &quot;fate of empires&quot; (pdf) by Sir John Glub.</p>

<p>I tend to see the democrats as more racist but I think this speaks to your point about everything being a bipartisan argument. To me if you want to require higher test scores from Asians and let minorities have preferential treatment you are being racist.</p>

<p>But, I bet if we sat down and really talked it over we&#39;d find that we agree on far more than we disagree. This is why divide and conquer is so powerful. You make enemies of people with common interests.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I mean I disagree, despite the fact that people like Soros may have helped start them.  I think things like MeToo and similar &quot;SJW&quot; stuff took off and got popular because they&#39;re responses to the long-established sexism/racism/whatever that&#39;s present in like every industry in America.  They&#39;re certainly not perfect &quot;movements&quot; and have their extreme members that blindly white-knight every single thing possible, such as the August Ames situation, but I think at its core much of it is a direct counter to a lot of the institutionalized prejudices that have been going on forever.  That said, things like the August Ames situation show how people take it way too far, which happens for everything.  I really don&#39;t think SJW stuff is meant to neuter men, but some members demonize essentially just being a white male so I can see where that perspective comes from.</p>

<p>Everyone knew the context though. It was a series of tweets between her and others in the industry. It was clear to everyone at the time she was talking about possible HIV exposure, even arguing about various testing standards.</p>

<p>A potential outbreak is very, very different than an actual outbreak, which is the claim made by OP. </p>

<p>It&#39;s highly unlikely that this person was not put on treatment as soon as they tested positive, especially if they were going to continue working. Most on treatment are undetectable, which means the odds of transmission are so low that in years of study it hasn&#39;t happened yet. </p>

<p>What do you suppose the likelihood is that an adult film star would know they are positive, decline treatment, continue working without disclosing, then infect several others who would also decline treatment and continue working? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Could be but this incident isn’t isolated.</p>

<p>A few weeks back there was a false rape allegation that fired everyone up. The #metoo crowd jumped in early to automatically believe the actress claiming she was raped until the producer released the full unedited video showing the girl was told 3x what the scene involved on camera and she agreed and then the entire shoot showing she was playful, laughing and flirting and fully participating in the shoot.</p>

<p>But it didn’t stop the SJW from demanding that the producer be banned from the industry and the actor accused of rape.</p>

<p>Producers are now adding security cameras to film the shoots because false allegations are becoming a problem.</p>

<p>Or a Twitter joke was made that Elon Musk hid a dead hooker in the trunk of the car he sent to space that turned into an outrage.</p>

<p>Or another joke that MILFs are annoying that a 22 year old actress with no kids got offended over on behalf of MILFs everywhere.</p>

<p>It’s getting ridiculous.</p>

<p>They&#39;re doing more damage to their own industry and fans than they realize.  But I don&#39;t think this is a conspiracy.  I think this is the product of SJW indoctrination in the American education system.  These girls are pretty much hardcore SJWs by the time they leave high school/go to college/worship celebrities and media and then they come to the porn industry and try to push the ideology they&#39;ve been indoctrinated into onto the industry without realizing the damage they&#39;re doing to producers and fans, aka their source of income.</p>

<p>They can be SJW all they like as civilians, but they&#39;re having a hard time understanding that they are in the sex industry to begin with and need to understand when and where being SJW makes sense and where it doesn&#39;t apply/causes more harm than good.</p>

<p>Turns out, it was an actor who used to shoot gay porn.
It is almost always an actor who used to shoot gay porn or else it was an actress who’s boyfriend shoots gay porn.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Do you know how incredibly hard it is to break into the industry as a male actor without starting in gay porn?  There&#39;s no way that ratio close to even, and warning that someone you&#39;re planning to work with came up that way isn&#39;t much of a warning.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t disagree with your point about trying to force gray issues to be black and white, but the story starts in a bad place.  There had to be some other reason she suspected he was infected, it&#39;s not like they don&#39;t test gay porn actors too...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There seems to be confusion regarding testing.  It alone does nothing to viruses.  Medical experts recommend a test after possible exposure and a follow up test months later, but that assumes no more possible exposures.  If a guy is promiscuous with guys and girls he can spread the virus to multiple people before failing a test.  Fake identities are common in the porn world and shoots can take place all over the world with no testing or regulation whatsoever.</p>

<p>Another factor not discussed in polite company is the rise in acts once rejected as gross and dangerous.  You&#39;ve got multiple guys taking turns on a woman&#39;s anus and rectum.  This is really high risk behavior.  </p>

<p>So, is it OK for me to spread around that you&#39;re a pedophile? I have no evidence that you are, but you might be because at some point you&#39;ve been around children, it&#39;s only right that people you come in to contact with you are aware if the risk you pose to their kids. </p>

<p>A potential outbreak is very, very different than an actual outbreak, which is the claim made by OP. </p>

<p>It&#39;s highly unlikely that this person was not put on treatment as soon as they tested positive, especially if they were going to continue working. Most on treatment are undetectable, which means the odds of transmission are so low that in years of study it hasn&#39;t happened yet. </p>

<p>What do you suppose the likelihood is that an adult film star would know they are positive, decline treatment, continue working without disclosing, then infect several others who would also decline treatment and continue working? </p>
