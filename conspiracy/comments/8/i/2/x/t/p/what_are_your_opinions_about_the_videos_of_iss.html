<p>I believe that space is real and the Earth is a globe, so I&#39;m really confused as to why they would pull off something like this. There are tons of examples of their harnesses malfunctioning while doing a flip or whatever and it looks pretty obvious to me. Also the womans hair in this particular video looks straight hair sprayed, and her hair does not float like it would in Zero G/Low Gravity. Are they trying to save money by doing it in a studio or something? Idk, let me know your thoughts!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The harness isn&#39;t on them to stabilize them from weightlessness ...it&#39;s to fake zero gravity.
NASA is another money pit used to divert funds from one place to another..
Look up the crew of the Challenger which they supposedly died in.
They are all still alive and some of them didn&#39;t even change their names.</p>

<p>The thing which baffles me is if we in fact landed on the moon 50 years ago why haven&#39;t we already have stations there?
I mean...the trip went off without a hitch and now for some reason we have no desire to go back....wat?</p>

<p>Oh..and the bright guys at NASA happened to lose or tape over all the data from the trip...</p>

<p>Sure....it would be like the discovery of the a bomb or the nukes and one day didn&#39;t want to miss an episode of general hospital and tape over all the data...
Give me a break. YouTube NASA green screen and make some popcorn cause your going to be there for a while</p>

<p>Then you have Antarctica. A continent as big as North &amp; South America put together that no one has ever seen &amp; you can’t see it on overhead fake satellites...</p>

<p>Only military scientists, John Kerry &amp; Nazi’s have ever been. I mean who the fuck knows what they are doing there.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think ISS is a hoax. So much more then just harnesses. What about some saying that they have to be extremely cautious with water in the ISS but then the next person lets it fly around and plays with it with no regards to anything? Also, look how they have women’s hair on the ISS (stiff and standing straight up)vs in those zero gravity planes (looks as if it’s in water/flowing freely). Completely obvious that they’re faking it once you realize what they’re showing you. </p>

<p>Someone doesn&#39;t know what thick hair is.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Sure do, and that&#39;s not it. That&#39;s exactly what back-combed and hair-sprayed hair looks like. Even thick hair would move if in zero G. If they&#39;re on the station, there is no way they would be using product on their hair, so why would it not move? Look at the links I supplied of others&#39; hair in zero G.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You think she&#39;s hot oil conditioning up there?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Hot oil conditioning would make her hair move more. However, no, I do not.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Er, are you suggesting that she got out of bed, all set for her globally-transmitted TV interview without sorting her bedhead? However, bed-head does move, just less than normal.</p>

<p>Different people different hair</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Sigh. Rather than resulting to this, why not post some sources of zero G footage on the space station <em>of hair moving</em> to strengthen your argument as to different hair?</p>

<p>K. That&#39;s what my hair looks like right now. </p>

<p>That&#39;s exactly what thick hair looks like in zero gravity.</p>

<p>It does.</p>

<p>Because it&#39;s thick.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Hot oil conditioning would make her hair move more. However, no, I do not.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That&#39;s right. Nice reading comprehension.</p>

<p>She&#39;s <em>not</em> treating her hair with salon products up there so it&#39;s not going to be feather light and silky.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Er, are you suggesting that she got out of bed, all set for her globally-transmitted TV interview without sorting her bedhead?</p>

<p>Pretty much. &quot;Oh shit, I don&#39;t want to look bad for the... oh wait I&#39;m an astronaut who cares&quot;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>However, bed-head does move, just less than normal.</p>

<p>Just like in the video.</p>

<p>Sigh.</p>

<p>The funniest thing is not only are you people ignorant, you&#39;re also extremely lazy.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Why would you need to justify your comment regarding fake space exploration and astronauts by referencing controlled-opposition &quot;flat earth&quot; and a proposal the space isn&#39;t real?</p>

<p>I assume you mean an alternative concept of space, such as a glass/ice firmament?</p>

<p>That said, why are these even relevant. They were both put out there to quell an inquiry into the space exploration hoax and to maintain and promote the new religion of atheistic material &quot;scientism&quot;.</p>

<p>[Remember, I&#39;m a spiritual guy; not religious! Where I use any &quot;atheism&quot;-related term I&#39;m merely referring to Vatican-promoted material/moon/vagina worship - which allows them to be &quot;Gods&quot;-on-earth over all men. Hence their socialist/feminist deployment we all currently suffering under.]</p>

<p>Space exploration is impossible.</p>

<p>There&#39;s no particular deep explanation to it aside from the esoteric facts you are not party yo: That we are physically born of earth, are the highest form of creative nature and have all our components and operations reflected in all previous natural creations. We are an amalgamated perfection of all before and are physically comprised of inorganic mineral salts - which we rely upon plant alchemy to transform into true organic medicine for us to fuel, fix and improve ourselves through. Your nervous system is entirely dependent upon this process and your heath is entirely dependent upon all components of your nervous system being fed by this so that each part can feed all other components of you body and mind. There&#39;s another factor to correct operation: FEAR (terrorism and war, anyone?) induces CRYSTALLISATION in the nervous system and slowing of necessary internal communications: Even when correctly fed, FEAR WILL CREATE MIND/BODY SICKNESS! Hmm?... Now, seriously consider this!</p>

<p>We are not leaving this planet because we are a creation of it and belong to it, despite the illusion provided by the fact we appear to be uprooted and mobile - though are, in fact, still bound by electro-magnetic laws outside our sensorial range of perception.</p>

<p>We didn&#39;t come from anywhere else and we are not going anywhere else. There were no &quot;Annunaki&quot; spacemen seeding us or other such crap.</p>

<p>We can also not overpopulate, nor damage, the earth by using up its resources - so their eugenics and &quot;eco/green&quot; &quot;energy&quot; slavery controls can f&#39;ck right off. They use their own corporations to engineer &quot;disasters&quot; to make us believe so - so that their[!] NGOs can move in and kick independent rural communities off their Agenda 2030 lands - in the name of &quot;humanitarian aid&quot; - and move everyone into their &quot;global/smart cities&quot;, where they then have absolute control over such disenfranchised people, their lives and deaths.</p>

<p>The main purpose of the hoax is to creating an atheistic religion through worship of supposed material scientific genius: &quot;scientism&quot;. I actually spell it &quot;PSYentism&quot; - as it&#39;s nothing more than an enslaving mind trick.</p>

<p>We&#39;ve had this religion imposed in the form of other fake &quot;reductionist&quot; PSYence in place for years; such as that of pharmaceuticals: &quot; from pharmakeus (fem. pharmakis) &quot;preparer of drugs, poisoner, sorcerer&quot; from pharmakon &quot;drug, poison, philter, charm, spell, enchantment.&quot;</p>

<p>They want us to believe in &quot;god particles&quot;, that they can create life-competing AI from digital switching as opposed arc-based analogue life systems.</p>

<p>They want us to believe in artificial wombs and the like. Any attempt to replace the proper sexual act will result in failure in some spiritual or physical way, as the complete sexual act contains unobserved chemically bonding signalling between composite vaginal fluids of the female material builder and the penile glans corona of the spiritually-imbued male depositor. Replace the act and the best you can create is dysfunctional beings. But then, it&#39;s likely all by-design, as they&#39;ve already been creating autistic automatons via their pharma vaccines for years.</p>

<p>They want us to believe that such digital tools can be enhancements to our lives - while all they can do is create illusion for distraction and further mind control: As how Image Metrics and Adobe VoCo can bring you completely fabricated &quot;terror incidents&quot; or put words into the mouths of enemies of the global state, whom they wish to parade as criminals.</p>

<p>Such digital machines are truly only ultra-fast data processors. That&#39;s all that is creating the illusion of intelligent machines. Even neural-net processors are only reorganising their pathways for efficiency. All such machine require manual feeding with data - via willing participants (smartphone users, spy OS users, spy browser users or other artificial eyes - aka cameras - everywhere. The &quot;safety&quot; excuse used to get the public to accept this military deployment is afforded by their plane-hijacking, and general, terrorism hoaxes.</p>

<p>This only aids a weaponised surveillance state, which is already being put in place through Google, MS, Apple, Canonical, associated hardware vendors and the rest; through their spy OSes, spy smartphones and (&quot;big-data&quot; &quot;biocuration&quot; HQ) CERN.</p>

<p>There is ONLY ONE CONSPIRACY.</p>

<p>It&#39;s brutal and it&#39;s already global, while engineered by the same morphing and expanding original blood-thirsty &quot;Akkadian&quot; empire we&#39;re always known.</p>

<p>Their new safe-haven is Switzerland.</p>

<p>Spiritual lock-down (externalising salvation) is achieved through Vatican.</p>

<p>Mind/body/soul lock-down (poisoning) is achieved through (&quot;Umbrella&quot;) &quot;Crown&quot; Corp. and their overarching &quot;Livery&quot; commercial control.</p>

<p>...all orders of knights and masons included.</p>

<p>All you need ask regarding perceived individual conspiracies reported here is, &quot;How might they fit into, or detract from, the entire malicious picture?&quot;</p>

<p>[Every time I state I&#39;m &quot;pushing it&quot;. I&#39;ve topped myself this time. I&#39;ll say &quot;bye&quot; now in case I have an &quot;unfortunate accident&quot; from which I do not return. ;-P ]</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is a great example of brainwashing!</p>

<p>Not that NASA is brainwashing you, the guy talking is. There&#39;s no evidence of wires in this video. He slows the video down dramatically and just keeps repeating the same thing over and over. &quot;There&#39;s wires. Look at him touching the wires. Can&#39;t you see the wires?&quot;</p>

<p>It&#39;s the simplest form of influence. If you convince someone that everyone else sees red, you&#39;ll agree because you don&#39;t want to be the odd one out. The animal part of our mind associates separation from our pack with the risk of death. Or as another man said, &quot;If you lie often enough it becomes the truth.&quot;</p>

<p>And her hair is like that because if she didn&#39;t style it, it&#39;d get in her way.</p>
