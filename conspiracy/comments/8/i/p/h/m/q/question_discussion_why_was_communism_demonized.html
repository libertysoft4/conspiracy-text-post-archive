        <p><span class="badge badge-primary">1</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;2018-05-11 by <a class="author" href="../../../../../../../../user/neuropathica.html">neuropathica</a></p>
        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Looking to seek out what you know, and your opinions about the demonisation of Communism in the 20th century.  I am trying to summarise what I know to be concise and informed.  I’d value the discussion.</p>

<p>My basic theory, which I’d like feedback on is this:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>The demonisation of Communism (and Socialist governments) is, bottom line, about the minority elites owning everything, and staying rich.</p></li>
<li><p>The 1800’s saw Monarchial rule overthrown across the globe.  The Elites saw the threat of losing power, property and resources, and wealth.</p></li>
<li><p>The US supported the Czar of Russia and sent a military expedition in 1917
to counter the revolution</p></li>
<li><p>World War 2 ended with the two super powers (Anglo-Anerican vs. Soviet) fighting for the control of the world especially Europe and developing nations (Latin America)</p></li>
</ul>

<p>** - At the end of WW2 The US adopted the philosophy that they ought to control the world ** and have since exerted effort toward complete hegemony.  The Soviet Bloc’s expansionism was a threat to that</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Communism contains labour force empowering ideals that would undermine established wealth and private property</p></li>
<li><p>Elites fear empowering the labour force who may turn against them, revolt in violence, and shut down profitable industry (unions striking, the cost and hassle of labour laws and equality)</p></li>
<li><p>The argument that Communism erodes human rights (the oft heard rhetoric about democracy) is a red herring as an examination of both the West and East show totalitarian and fascist mistreatment of the populace and other nations (as in coups)</p></li>
<li><p>It also boils down to something I heard about the historical ‘inventorying’ of the finite resources of the planet and seeking to own and control them</p></li>
<li><p>Western hatred of Communism is also fuelled by the Marxist-Leninist stated objectives to undermine the West </p></li>
<li><p>The Catholic church finds the inherent atheism of Communism a threat and wicked (so like a religious and morsl crusade)</p></li>
<li><p>Communism can involve closed, protectionist economy that cannot be exploited by foreign markets</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Those are some of major “why” answers.  It’s multi-factorial in nature, surely.  I’m trying to organise this a bit better and include the most salient bits.</p>

<p>Thanks in advance for your feedback and sharing what you know and your opinions!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Communism was demonized because it was hijacked by fools that created the USSR and CCCP- two states that were/are definitely not Communist except in name, and that perpetrated many atrocities against their own people.</p>

<p>Communism as an ideal endgame isn&#39;t a bad thing. But all attempted implementations have fallen victim to human nature. I don&#39;t think we will accomplish real Socialism/Communism until we establish a post-scarcity environment- and that is easier said than done. </p>

<p>For fucks sake he read the entire gulag archipelago which I couldn&#39;t even finish out of sheer boredom and staleness.  There is only so many ways to deprive people of their dignity and live.</p>

<p>But out of curiosity what is the source of your claim that he has never read a primary source on Marxism, and be specific.  What do you qualify as a primary source on Marxism?  Obviously I would assume Marx himself is a primary source but if linked a video of Peterson discussing his detailed studies of Marx&#39;s writings you would probably move the goal posts.</p>

<p>As opposed to the oppressed versus the oppressors?</p>

<p>Assuming you&#39;re right about my world view (you&#39;re not) isn&#39;t it kind of silly to criticize someone for seeing good versus evil when your own ideology is hilariously similar in it&#39;s simpleton friendly class definitions?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>We see the world as process of historical development through power struggles between class interests.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Okay well a process of historical development is just a fruity way of saying history.  Which is probably accurate since you&#39;re all obsessed with a failed ideology from history.  One that was born in the same cradle as Nazism and only survived a little longer than Nazism because of mutually assured destruction.</p>

<p>If we&#39;re honest with ourselves here Nazism would have survived longer than Communism if both had been left alone to experience the &quot;process of historical development&quot;.  Thank God that&#39;s not the case it&#39;s bad enough we had to put up with communist as long as we did.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I discuss ideas and theories too, that&#39;s why we&#39;re talking.  You seem to prefer to spend more time discussing the faults of the person presenting the ideas, like your criticisms of Jordan Peterson and I instead of considering the merits of the philosophies like Marxism/capitalism.  The entire reason I&#39;m talking to you is that you failed to defend Marxism and instead attacked Peterson as ignorant of Karl Marx.</p>

<p>I guarantee you that Peterson is familiar with Marx&#39;s writings regardless of the fact he doesn&#39;t promote them.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>What has the US capitalist state done to its dissidents like Geronimo, Leonard Peltier, Malcolm X, MLK, Chelsea Manning?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes we have handled some dissidents poorly.  But it&#39;s a testimonial to the superiority of our society and government that there hasn&#39;t been 100,000,000 &quot;dissidents&quot; and that we don&#39;t actually have a law on the books criminalizing dissident behavior.</p>

<p>No system is perfect so you&#39;ll be able to point out different ways in which our system isn&#39;t perfect all week long but I&#39;ll be able to counter with evidence that we are imperfectly better than the communist alternative.</p>

<p>As far as regurgitation of propaganda goes, I would take your movement more seriously if it was original, different or anything other than a continuation of the now 90 year old communist revolutionary BS.</p>

<p>I&#39;ll purge myself to the door.</p>

<p>But you discount any that doesn&#39;t frame communist Utopia as great and splendid.  There is no historical literature about it&#39;s implementation that isn&#39;t negative in it&#39;s totality.  We literally have evidence that it devolves into a purge feast.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No.  There is a lot of contradiction among the Marxist writers.  Trotsky and Luxembourg have problems with Lenin.  Michael Parenti wholeheartedly disagrees with Noam Chomsky, and to a lesser extent, Richard Wolff.  We fight amongst ourselves over the best way forward. We generally agree on the end goal of equitable distribution of produced wealth but there is a lot of disagreement on how to administer it and the strategies to get there.  We have a goal.  We are in the debating stage of formulating the process to get there.</p>

<p>You have no familiarity with theory and neither does Peterson.  You both are posers.  It&#39;s like if I went to the American Medical Association and spout the argument that bloodletting is a viable medical procedure because I read some quacks who support it.  </p>

<p>You cannot formulate the Why and the How the theory is invalid without resorting the arbitrary &quot;human nature&quot; argument and the small data sample of the last century.  You also ignore the dynamics of geopolitics among the players and make false comparisons.  Cuba under Castro is better than Cuba under Batista.  Cuba is not as good as Canada because Canada industrialized 100 years before Cuba and the US does not impose a trade embargo on Canada.  I am a History major.  90 years is a blink in the timespan of human development. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The numbers of the purge are greatly exaggerated by Timothy Snyder.  He doesn&#39;t have the documents to back it up.  Wikipedia is pop-culture.</p>

<p>Purges of counter-revolutionary agents are necessary otherwise the revolution fails, the old regime gets back into power, and the revolutionaries are executed.  This happens in every revolution.  If Robespierre didn&#39;t implement the Reign of Terror, the French Revolution would have failed and there would be no liberal ideological model for the American Revolution to copy, so it too would never have happened.  Benedict Arnold was purged.  </p>

<p>Every drastic change in systems of governance is violent.  If everyone is dogmatically against violence like you, then we would all still be worshipping the feet of pharaohs.  You are a coward, a reactionary, and what was referred to in the Antebellum period as a House Ni**er.</p>

<p>Oh? What haven&#39;t I read?

    <div class="md"><p>My problems arise in a metaphysical sence. Capitalism and communism are a false dichotomy. </p>

<p>I am neither. </p>

<p>My problem isn&#39;t with Marxism and its critique of capitalism, it is with the poor knowledge of human nature and incentive systems. Marxism works on paper, but when applied greed overrides the greater good of &quot;communism&quot;.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree with you that capitalism and communism is a false dichotomy.  They don&#39;t oppose each other as much as one will grow out of the death of the other.  Capitalism will kill itself through it&#39;s internal process of concentration and force societies to choose between domination of the rich against the poor or the domination of the poor against the rich.  Either way, there will be violence.  Just as capitalism grew from the death of feudalism after a period of bloody revolution, so will communism.</p>

<p>Marx&#39;s critique of capitalism is almost universally accepted as accurate.  How to replace it is the next step and no one has yet figured out how do that.  And that&#39;s OK.  It&#39;s a work in progress.  Greed and corruption applies to every system.  It is not unique to communism.  There&#39;s no easy answer, it&#39;s up to the people to democratically punish and remove corrupt leaders.  That will be part of the struggle. It&#39;s a long process.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Capitalism is not the same now as it was in it&#39;s early stages.  Corporatism is the stage of capitalism where the power of the bourgeois outgrows democracy itself and takes over the levers of the state.  There is no purely free market.  It has never existed and never will exist.  A <em>free</em> market is more of a utopian construct than communism.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I’m a pessimist.  I don’t think there’s anything that would work (that I am aware of).  Life sucks that way.</p>

<p>I do appreciate people who have devoted their lives looking for an answer.  If people have good intentions toward improving the society and the lives of others, that counts for something.  That said, I can understand the position that results and outcomes are the best measure and that the proverb is true:  the road to hell is paved with good intentions.</p>

<p>I also don’t think that oohing over the perceived benefits of Capitalism is a positive because it encourages a wilful blindness to history, present corruption, and the unfulfilled dreams of many and plays in to the ‘complacent sheep herd’ mentality that is conspiracy fact.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You should consider nihilism instead, it’s much more fulfilling than good old pessimism. I agree, life sucks, but there is nothing we can do. Both systems suck, but the reason we are capitalist is the reason we can say that.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Antonio Gramsci&#39;s idea of [Hegemony]<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cultural_hegemony">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cultural_hegemony</a> is the key word here.  Communism is demonized because it goes against the cultural hegemony of the capitalist nation that we live in.  There is a ton of academic research that goes against the myths of communist horrors, totalitarianism, and general badness propagated in the popular media but you need to look for it because you will never hear it on TV.  [Dr. Grover Furr]<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t2SokNTdp5c">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t2SokNTdp5c</a> has done a lot of work get to the bottom of things.  </p>

<p>Socialism/communism is in it&#39;s infancy.  The theory is still being developed.  The countries that have tried to implement it are first trials, experiments.  It took thousands of years for civilization to go from slavery to feudalism to capitalism.  </p>

<p>Mao was right.  After overthrowing the bourgeois state the new socialist state needs to institute a cultural revolution to destroy the lingering capitalist ideology.  The Bolsheviks failed to do this and let revisionist opportunists such as Krushchev and Brezhnev worm their way into the leadership and diverge from Lenin&#39;s doctrine of &quot;all power to the soviets&quot;.  Soviet means workers&#39; council.</p>

<p>Ignore the mouth breathers who can&#39;t entertain a new idea of social organization.</p>
