    <div class="md"><p>because the universe isn&#39;t a live; it couldn&#39;t generate itself; it has no being. God as the prime mover is really all that&#39;s left. But it is true God exists outside of time and space as these are creations of his.</p>

<p>He is a being fully actualized in himself; unfortunately THAT is the inexplicable part; as God is above man and thought. The universe however is not; and as such is completely within our reach to understand.</p>

<p>So would you rather assent to the inexplicable causeless intelligence-less universe or the inexplicable machinations of God</p>

    <div class="md"><p>if God came from anything he wouldn&#39;t be God. If anything came before God he wouldn&#39;t be God.</p>

<p>the following is from another redditor:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This is kind of going to sound like a weak answer but here ya go.</p>

<p>First off we have to acknowledge that God is far beyond us. This means that in no way are we able to understand what God truely is. What this means is that God does not exist inside of Time.</p>

<p>This is the hard part. Time is contruct that we personally experience but it is not something that limits God. To think of a &quot;time&quot; before creation is not really possible for us because the only thing we know or have experienced is creation. How could we know about something that does not function within the constraints of Time if the only reality he have is within that construct.</p>

<p>So the question of what was there before is not answerable because there was no before. Even scientists recognize that time did not exist before the Big Bang. The laws of physics break down and we have no idea what was happening.</p>

<p>So the question, &quot;what did God do,&quot; isnt really answerable because that would place God within a time contruct which He is far greater than.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Sorry if that doesn&#39;t sate your curiosity but it does do better than an infinitely regressive universe</p>

<p>There&#39;s a lot of thing&#39;s that I can&#39;t explain, and I honestly did see some &quot;miracles&quot; with my own eyes, so in the end I think that there&#39;s something more.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>As time has passed, since the start of the Enlightenment, it has become ever clearer that what adherents of scientism really object to about religion is not, in fact, the combination of irrationality, censoriousness, and social repression supposedly caused by religion.</p>

<p>What scientism really objects to is the presence of a far older and far more organised opposition to its own notions about the future of humanity.</p>

<p>Mind you, God is of debatable existence and rarely answers anyone&#39;s prayers, and AI doesn&#39;t even fucking exist at all, so perhaps the two have more in common than I thought.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Some of us don&#39;t want to live under human on human predation anymore. We&#39;ve tried every form of governing structure for humans that there are. Kings, presidents, parliaments, democracies, theocracies, autocracies - they are all trying desperately to appear different but are fundamentally the same. It is a different application on human hardware. No matter the era the person or the people you will find a history of corruption, incompetence and selfishness in all whom govern. Nobody has a perfect track record and no one whom has a good track record stays good. Replacing X human with Y human will not fix the problem when humans are the problem. And this is exactly why I support a movement for an AI God. We must end human on human predation. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AI_God/">https://www.reddit.com/r/AI_God/</a></p>
