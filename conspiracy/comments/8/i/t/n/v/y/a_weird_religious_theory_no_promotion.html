        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Sorry for the lack of explanation (I have negative karma cuz of a meme i sent in the wrong community)</p>

<p>This theory I thought of.  Totally wacky and weird theory.
So we have Christianity, which believes in Jesus the Son of Christ.</p>

<p>We have Islam, which believes in Mohammad, the last prophet of Allah.</p>

<p>If I got anything wrong, please immediately tell me so I can fix it.</p>

<p>The holy texts of those religions/beliefs are, the Qur&#39;an and the Holy Bible.</p>

<p>They both have similar recurring people and ideas.
Both religions originate from a man named Abraham. 
Abraham had 2 sons, Isaac and Ishmael (According to both texts and internet sources) 
Now so far, a single god has been doing all these miracles for Abraham. Then this is where the conflict starts.<br/>
Christianity: God told Isaac the land would be his
Islam: God (or Allah in this case) told Ishmael the land was his
Now from there all the stories happen, until it ends up at Jesus, and Mohammad. 
Ok, enough explaining of the not-theory part.&quot;, I&#39;ve wasted enough of your time already.</p>

<p>What if the Qur&#39;an and the Holy Bible are both true, but they are different accounts of what happened?
Most of these comments will be about how dumb I am and how obvious that is probably what it is.  But I&#39;ll elaborate more.
If a big event/disaster happens, there are different sides of what happened.
For example, a hurricane strikes an island.
The villagers on the island recall another villager saving other people.
Some villagers claim they were sent by the government to do so.  Others claim it was dome by heart.  We have 2 accounts of what happened.  The same situation of the Bible and Qur&#39;an. </p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>This theory lacks lots of evidence.
Similar ideas/events.
If this offends anyone, it is 101% UNINTENTIONAL. If this offends you tell me and I will take this down.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh right that&#39;s why the Romans tried so hard to quell Christianity because they loved the agenda so much.</p>

<p>But yeah OT was the first. The new testament is related in that Christ&#39;s coming was the fulfillment of Jewish prophecy and tradition. Really Christianity and Judaism go hand in hand referencing eachother. Islam isnthe outlier.</p>

<p>Muhammed comes along with a poor idea of both; claims Jesus was another prophet and then throws all that history out the window creating Islam.</p>

<p>The Quran is definitely not inspired by the same dude who did OT/NT</p>

    <div class="md"><p>yeah, Islam is definitely the outlier. </p>

<p>the claims of Christianity began when multiple people sprung up alleging that they were eyewitnesses that the Messiah promised in the Old Testament had truly appeared. They claimed he came performing miracles, healing the sick, giving sight to the blind; they claimed that they themselves were also given the ability to perform miracles; they even claimed that those who believed the message they were preaching about the Messiah would be given the ability to perform miracles also. And somehow these teachings exploded all across the ancient world, largely among populations who would&#39;ve had the ability to verify whether or not they were accurate.</p>

<p>then we have Mohammed, who receives a vision in private that is supposedly from the angel Gabriel in the AD 600s. Right off the bat, the message meets the specific qualifications of a message that the Bible <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Galatians+1%3A8-9&amp;amp;version=ESV">warns in advance should not be received.</a> The message claims that the Messiah never really came; that Scripture isn&#39;t really Scripture; that God dropped the ball basically. And then Mohammed, the only witness to the message, manages to find support for the message - largely on the basis of how the message played to the ethnic homogeneity of Arabs and encouraged them to violence against their aggressors.</p>

<p>I would say: these things are easy to write off with a handwave if you don&#39;t really pay attention to them, if you only have a cursory understanding of them, but there is definitely a lot of nuance to them if you really look at them.</p>

<p>And yeah it is a shame people write them all off without thought rather than learn about them and the differences. </p>

<p>In the bible, Arabs are the children of Hagar, the Egyptian servant  the  of Abraham&#39;s wife Sarah, fathered by Abraham because Sarah was at the time barren, Sarah then near or around age 90 gave birth to a son by Abraham, named Issac.  </p>

<p>Hagar&#39;s son was named Ishmael and the father of the Arab people,</p>

<p>And the women said, “When we made offerings to the queen of heaven and poured out drink offerings to her, was it without our husbands&#39; approval that we made cakes for her bearing her image and poured out drink offerings to her?”Then Jeremiah said to all the people, men and women, all the people who had given him this answer:“As for the offerings that you offered in the cities of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem, you and your fathers, your kings and your officials, and the people of the land, did not the Lord remember them? Did it not come into his mind?The Lord could no longer bear your evil deeds and the abominations that you committed. Therefore your land has become a desolation and a waste and a curse, without inhabitant, as it is this day.It is because you made offerings and because you sinned against the Lord and did not obey the voice of the Lord or walk in his law and in his statutes and in his testimonies that this disaster has happened to you, as at this day.”Jeremiah said to all the people and all the women, “Hear the word of the Lord, all you of Judah who are in the land of Egypt.Thus says the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel: You and your wives have declared with your mouths, and have fulfilled it with your hands, saying, ‘We will surely perform our vows that we have made, to make offerings to the queen of heaven and to pour out drink offerings to her.’ Then confirm your vows and perform your vows!Therefore hear the word of the Lord, all you of Judah who dwell in the land of Egypt: Behold, I have sworn by my great name, says the Lord , that my name shall no more be invoked by the mouth of any man of Judah in all the land of Egypt, saying, ‘As the Lord God lives.’Behold, I am watching over them for disaster and not for good. All the men of Judah who are in the land of Egypt shall be consumed by the sword and by famine, until there is an end of them. - Jeremiah 44:19-27</p>

<p>For a group that compiled the Bible, you sure don&#39;t follow it:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The Catholic teaching on this subject is expressed in the papal encyclical Ad Caeli Reginam, issued by Pope Pius XII.... The title, Queen of Heaven, has long been a Catholic tradition, <strong>included in prayers and devotional literature,</strong> and seen in Western art in the subject of the Coronation of the Virgin, from the High Middle Ages, long before it was given a formal definition status by the Church.</p>

<p>Jesus said to him, “I am the way, and the truth, and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me.</p>

<p>We do not sacrifice to her or give her any worship due God. And prayer to Saints is licit as we are one church throughout time (including heaven)and because saints through their works on earth have Merit with God and so can intercede for us with the Lord.</p>

<p>The difference between these celestial relationships are called Dulia (the honor given to saints) Latria (worship given to God alone) and Hyperdulia the veneration offered to the Virgin. <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05188b.htm">More here</a></p>

<p>You&#39;re definitely going to have to give me a name or source for that claim; I even tried to find one. 
St Jerome
 is known for creating the Latin Vulgate using the canon approved in the Synod of Hippo (393) which is when the Church compiled the bible.</p>

<p>The king James version is awful he may have deserved death /s (seriously though Douay-rheims is a much closer translation without ye olde english)</p>

<p>I explained what you call idolatry to the other guy; there&#39;s a difference between Dulia, Hyperdulia and Latria.</p>

<p>Give me a couple of those pagan ideas we incorporated, please. I&#39;m also pretty sure no actual Pope has claimed to be Christ; they would be allowed to be pope. They are the Vicar of Christ on earth (separate thing); to feed His sheep; the place originally given to St Peter.</p>

<p>And Martin Luther, they literally made a movie about this. He translated the Bible from Hebrew Greek which was the proper translation...for you to say he should be killed for that? You probably should not be calling your self a &quot;Christian, or catholic&quot;. </p>

<p>Praying to a saint or bowing before ANY graven image is idolitry. When they first set in, they painted over idols of Isis and her son Tammuz with Mary and Jesus...they were literally praying to idols. Even today, you worship and pray to saints and Mary, which is forbidden..the bible says specifically not to do this. Also, a priest can not intercede on your behalf...only Christ. The incense and things you use in &quot;ceremonies&quot; was the exact way pagans did it. Many of the symbols the priests use or even in the Vatican or pegan or honor pegan Babylonian Gods. Repeating prayers (and agian to Mary) The Bible teaches against.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>profession of faith in Christ, but because they would not include pagan deities in their faith as well. Then, with Constantine&#39;s emphasis on making his new-found Christianity palatable to the heathen in the Empire, the &quot;Christianization&quot; of these pagan deities was facilitated. For example, <strong>pagan rituals and idols gradually took on Christian meanings and names and were incorporated into &quot;Christian&quot; worship (e.g., &quot;saints&quot; replaced the cult of pagan gods in both worship and as patrons of cities; mother/son statues were renamed Mary and Jesus; etc.),</strong> pagan holidays were reclassified as Christian holy days (e.g., the Roman Lupercalia and the feast of purification of Isis became the Feast of the Nativity; the Saturnalia celebrations were replaced by Christmas celebrations; an ancient festival of the dead was replaced by All Souls Day, rededicated to Christian heroes [now Halloween]; etc.). A transition had occurred -- <strong>instead of being persecuted for failure to worship pagan deities, Christians who did not agree with the particular orthodoxy backed by the Emperor were now persecuted in the name of Christ.&quot;</strong></p>

<p>&quot;Early believers kept Saturday as the Sabbath until March 7, 321 CE when Pope Constantine passed a law requiring believers to worship on Sunday, <strong>the day the pagans worshipped the sun-god.</strong> Believers still kept Saturday as the Sabbath until another law was passed eleven years later. This law signed into decree by Pope Constantine forbid believers to worship on the Sabbath (Saturday) and it was punishable by death by the Catholic Church. <strong>Many believers were burned to death by the Catholic Church for keeping the Sabbath. &quot;</strong></p>

<p>From wikipeadia</p>

<p>&quot;Those who refused were charged with impiety and punished by arrest, imprisonment, torture, and/or executions.&quot;</p>

<p>Some Pagan ceremonies were brought in and the festivals became modern holidays as pagans joined the early church.[1] The Pagan vernal equinoxcelebration was &#39;Christianized&#39;[1] and then referred to as the Annunciation to the Blessed Virgin Mary or Annunciation of the Lord and celebrated as the Feast of the Annunciation. The Germanic Pagan solstice celebrations (Midsummer festivals) are also sometimes referred to by Neopagans and others as Litha, stemming from Bede&#39;s De temporum rationeand the fire festival or Litha was a tradition for many pagans. This pagan holiday was basically brought in and given a name change, and in Christianity was then associated with the nativity of John the Baptist, which now is observed on the same day, June 24, in the Catholic, Orthodox and some Protestant churches. It is six months before Christmasbecause Luke 1:26 and Luke 1.36 imply that John the Baptist was born six months earlier than Jesus, although the Bible does not say at which time of the year this happened.[2]</p>

It&#39;s a pagan title that was incorporated from the Etruscan-Latin polytheistic culture (700 BC) who lived before the Romans. <strong>The early Catholics said that the Pontifex Maximus was the &quot;King of Heathendom,&quot; the evil high priest of the pagan mystery religion of Rome.</strong> ...He was then urged by the Catholic bishops to renounce the cultic Roman title, and instead grant it to their exalted leading bishop over Rome. 
<strong>Pontifex Maximus is a name that&#39;s being used by the Roman Catholic Church clergy today. Though it may be abbreviated into Pope or Papa, yet it&#39;s clearly a title incorporated directly from paganism.Pope Gregory I (601 AD) said in so many words literally, &quot;We must compromise with the pagans in order to further Christianity.&quot;</strong></p>

<p>The Popes of Rome proclaim that they are the Vicar of Christ, which means “in place of Christ.”  The word antichrist doesn’t just mean “against Christ“, it means “in place of Christ.”
Pope Boniface VIII said “We declare, assert, define and pronounce to be subject to the Roman Pontiff is to every creature altogether necessary for salvation… I have the authority of the King of Kings. I am all in all, and above all, so that God Himself and I, the Vicar of Christ, have but one consistory, and I am able to do almost all that God can do. What therefore, can you make of me but God?” 
Pope Pius IX said, “I alone… am the successor of the apostles, the vicar of Jesus Christ. I am the way, the truth, and the life…”
Pope Pius X declared, “The Pope is not simply the representative of Jesus Christ. On the contrary, he is Jesus Christ Himself, under the veil of the flesh. Does the Pope speak? It is Jesus Christ who is speaking, hence, when anyone speaks of the Pope, it is not necessary to examine but to obey.”
Pope Pius XII said, “…recognize the Holy, Catholic, Roman Church to be the only true Church of Jesus Christ, outside of which neither sanctity nor salvation can be found. Call them to the unity of the one fold, granting them the grace to believe every truth of our holy faith and to submit themselves to the Supreme Roman Pontiff, the Vicar of Jesus Christ on earth.”
The power of the Roman Catholic Church reached a pinnacle in the 12th through 15th centuries, as they attained: independent sovereignty, absolute supremacy over the Christian Church, and full control of the princes of Europe.
Pope Innocent III (1198-1216) said “We may according to the fullness of our power, dispose of the law and dispense above the law. Those whom the Pope of Rome doth separate, it is not a man that separates them but God. For the Pope holdeth place on earth, not simply of a man but of the true God.” (Source: “Decretals of Greogory IX,” Book 1, chapter 3.)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>First, about the symbolism I mentioned, you can not deny, that everything they use is not Christian, it&#39;s pagan, to the sun behind Mary, which is the EXACT depiction found on Egyptian artifacts is of the sun god and goddess Isis. Even the &quot;throne&quot; the pope sits on is reminiscent of snakes and the devil, the also have known occultic symbolism all over the Vatican and on the very robes they wear today. The hats? Same hats as Egyptian priest who served these pegan Gods...go look them up.</p>

<p>Lucifer the light barrier under the Vatican, there is also idols of Isis and other gods.

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s all the same religion, from the same God. The difference is that an older religion doesn&#39;t believe in a more recent religion.  </p>

<p>For example, Christians believe in Moses as a prophet and the old testament. But Jews don&#39;t believe in Jesus or the Bible. Muslims believe in Jesus and Moses as prophets as well as the Torah and Bible as books of God; however, Christians and Jews don&#39;t believe in the Quran or the prophet Mohammed.  </p>

<p>In essence, the 3 religions as well as dozens of other older religions/books convey the same message with minor differences. The people, usually willfully ignorant, kill each other over labels without understanding what they are fighting about.  </p>

<p>It&#39;s a huge disaster.</p>

I am a different person than the person who uploaded this. (Literally.  The owner of the account got grounded so he lost his reddit account) 
I&#39;ve decided to delete this post after further review due to the subject of his matter.
After all, that&#39;s just a theory....
A BAD THEORY!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh right that&#39;s why the Romans tried so hard to quell Christianity because they loved the agenda so much.</p>

<p>But yeah OT was the first. The new testament is related in that Christ&#39;s coming was the fulfillment of Jewish prophecy and tradition. Really Christianity and Judaism go hand in hand referencing eachother. Islam isnthe outlier.</p>

<p>Muhammed comes along with a poor idea of both; claims Jesus was another prophet and then throws all that history out the window creating Islam.</p>

<p>The Quran is definitely not inspired by the same dude who did OT/NT</p>
