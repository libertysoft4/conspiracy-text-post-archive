<p>Wrong. If you look at the esoteric core mystical teachings, it is about Enlightenment and freedom from the system and from religions. The same fuckers that killed Jesus, took over Christianity and turned into a Bureaucratic Hierarchy of systematic enslavement via watered down dogmatism.</p>

<p>Translation:  What Christianity <em>may</em> have initially begun as WAYYYY BACK IN THE DAY <em>might</em> have had a core of real truth in it.</p>

<p>You are being ignorant (willfully or otherwise - as I said above) of the extent to which that initial germ of possible validity Christianity might have begun with got utterly undermined and destroyed.  In other words, these “esoteric core mystical teachings” you speak of are A) available absolutely independent of anything Christianity offers (i.e. one can get all of those teachings and more elsewhere), and B) the information Christianity has in it of those “core esoteric values” is so obscurely hidden in a monstrous nest of confusing fables at this point that, again, one would be <em>far</em> better suited to find their truth elsewhere in some other manner where one doesn’t have to dig through all manner of confusing and often undermining loopholes and dead ends to get it.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The only people who believe he didn&#39;t exist are a few fringe pseudo scholars which none of the others really take seriously</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There are actually a <em>lot</em> of very intelligent scholars that put forth quite valid reasoning in questioning the validity of that figure’s existence…so I don’t know where you’re getting your information from.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Religion forms around many things, science, philosophies, politics, etc. This is what stupid human manipulators do, they take something ultimately good, and twist it into something used for profit and control</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Correct.  That’s part of the very point of the link I provided.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>that hardly takes away from the existence and teaching of Enlightened Beings.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Correct.  Jesus was so far from the most enlightened being on this planet that one would be far better suited to derive their life teachings elsewhere, however.  As the famed Eastern mystic philosopher Swami Vivekananda said:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The greatest...[humans (gender neutralized)]…in the world have passed away unknown. The Buddhas and the Christs that we know are but second-rate heroes in comparison with the greatest...[humans]...of whom the world knows nothing. Hundreds of these unknown heroes have lived in every country working silently. Silently they live and silently they pass away; and in time their thoughts find expression in Buddhas or Christs, and it is these latter that become known to us.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Jesus is just one pebble in a beach of enlightened masters that have existed.  One, again, would be better served moving toward teachings that are not as fraught with loopholes, dead ends, and other undermining messages inserted by figures who wanted to bring the teachings down (and to a large extent greatly succeeded).</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I&#39;ve had at least 3 dozen OBE&#39;s, all of which came after an NDE in a work accident and have seen heavens, hells, purgatories, numerous dimensions, portals, angels, demons, Jesus, Buddha, Monks, Saints, Aliens, and all sorts of shit that exists in the Non-Physical Spirit Plane.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You saw them because, as I imagine you at this point know, they actually exist.  This third dimensional perspective most of us have been limited to on this planet is but the tiniest sliver of reality; the smallest slice of what actually exists.  We live in a sea of sentient, multidimensional existences all around us.</p>

<p>Christianity might not have <em>started</em> as a joke, but it has most definitely been turned into one to such an extent that one would be wise to not spend too much time giving it too much credence.</p>

<p>I feel the same way.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Islam has been vilified in the west.  It’s no worse than any other religion.  Judaism has been destroyed by Ashkenazi Khazar zionists.  Both religions have been hijacked by nefarious influences and made into something far worse than what they started off as.</p>

<p>The soul doesn’t long for structure.  It already has it.  It’s the body that the soul animates that is largely ignorant of what it truly is and where it comes from that longs for structure.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>And I would say that those political philosophies have contributed largely to preventing humanity from evolving even further.  Perhaps they might have had a function in their inception, but it would seem they wore out their welcome pretty quickly, and now function more as tools of enslavement than anything else.</p>

<p>I would highly recommend watching all sections of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgIbNIElE20">this talk</a> (there are five sections).</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>The degeneracy is the result of a manipulative system that brought about not only the political structure responsible for a great deal of the maladies that exist today, but that system (and the figures, human or non-human, responsible for it) also created the church system and the religions responsible for the manipulation and the dumbing down of human minds all across the globe.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>People in places like Sweden and Germany, are now converting to Islam, something that is even worse than anything Christianity has ever been.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You couldn’t be more abysmally incorrect.  Islam has quite a lot of catching up to do before it even begins to approach the number of murders and genocides perpetrated in the name of Christianity.  You have fallen under the propaganda perpetrated by the western MSM upon duped citizens.</p>

<p>To be sure, Islam is no better than Christianity.  Ultimately, they’re both exactly the same in that they came from the same root.  I’ve always found it quite strange, as a matter of fact, that Christianity, Islam, and Judaism ultimately all believe in almost identical things, yet manage to go to war with each other over which specific interpretation of their confusion is the correct one.  smh</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Christianity offers something very Unique that is not found in any of the other religions. A figure that one can talk to, love and learn about which makes the life for some folks better because of this, and that&#39;s fine by me</p>
</blockquote>

<p>None of that means anything if that figure is A) a  made up lie and never existed in the first place (which there are a lot of arguments for and against on either side), and B) even if the figure did exist, it’s recommended to be quite circumspect of any teachings attributed to him since to a large extent they’ve been so distorted as to have little resemblance to what might have actually been said and meant.</p>

<p>This is not to disparage Christianity in and of itself.  It is rather to let it be known that it is ultimately no better than any other form of indoctrination on this planet is all.</p>

<p>Sure it is. Wahhbism and other fringe radical elements, have a hijacked a religion which was already shit to begin with. Outside of Sufism, there is no Enlightenment or Spiritual Awakening maps in Islam other the submission and rules. Same deal with Judaism, there is no Enlightenment outside of Kabbalah </p>

<blockquote>

<p>Agreed. Judaism was shit to begin with though. Its non-inclusive, also creates orthodox idiots, is responsible for Genocide (Caananites) and many other crimes</p>

<p>I disagree. We are exactly where we are supposed to be right now with all things given, and we are hardly where we are supposed to get to, something that still can take 1000-10000 years.</p>

<p>Perhaps the exoteric dogmatic form sure, but these days there is a massive increasing movement of people seeking out the mystical branches of various ideologies </p>

<blockquote>
<p>I would highly recommend watching all sections of this talk (there are five sections).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;ve seen that interview and the original Zeitgeist docu&#39;s. I agree with some aspects of what Joseph is saying for sure, but not everything.</p>

<p>For example blaming &quot;capitalism&quot; for being the reason everything is fuckd up I disagree with. All alternatives that have been tried, have produced bullshit, and inequalities as well. Inequality exists within nature, within the order of existence, and it will always be this way for a loooooong ass time until we reach a balanced enlightened population. &quot;Capitalism&quot; has basically become a popular whipping boy.</p>

<p>He&#39;s also talking about happiness indexes in countries that have a mostly homogenous (denmark/finland) population, whereas U.S. is a mixing pot of different groups, different levels of IQ/Intelligence, different cultures, and many other differences</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Yea sure, huma nature takes anything that exists and will eventually fuck it up. But that doesn&#39;t mean that there aren&#39;t honest, good people, who still have it good in capitalist countries compared to starving folks in Africa (speaking of relative aspects) including people who have a genuine mystical relationship with God/Enlightenment through their chosen religion.</p>

<p>In earlier decades when Christianity was more of a thing in the U.S., though degeneracy did occur then as well , at least it was hidden or done in secret because the of the cultural backlash.</p>

<p>Now it&#39;s promoted in music, movies, certain NWO groups which fund and program this into Hollywood movies, albums, shows, culture.</p>

<p>Good read here and can be approximated to what we are currently going through:</p>

<p>LOL, you can&#39;t be serious. First off, horrors done in the name of &quot;Enter your religion&#39;s name here&quot; have certainly happened in the past, however, Christianity has evolved and adapted to modern day culture and we are talking about the present day situation.</p>

<p>Christianity also doesn&#39;t have in its creed a call for global take over and control of the earth under a future Shariah law and being ruled under a Global Mahdi system:</p>

<p>In fact. there is no other cult which calls for this kind of Global takeover. Though Judaism (under the Ashkenazi) has certainly gotten into self into key positions of Globalism, Power, Control, Banking Systems, Media, Hollywood, and so on</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You have fallen under the propaganda perpetrated by the western MSM upon duped citizens.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yeah sorry I dont watch MSM propaganda. I actually read books and study these topics, have reads the Koran and most other books of other religions, and also have lived and been to Europe and have witnessed the horrors occuring there from the invaders that belong to the cult of Islam. Best thing for the world would have been for the Muslims to remain in the Middle East, and now that the cancer is spreading, we will see an Islamic Europe and an eventual world war against this cancer (similar to the Ottoman wars but on global scale)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>To be sure, Islam is no better than Christianity. Ultimately, they’re both exactly the same in that they came from the same root.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>HArdly the truth. Jesus teaches Loves, Enlightenment, transcendence. Mohammed was a pedo who taught war, division, submission, rules, and created a cult as an identity for the M.E. as a form of unity</p>

<blockquote>
<p>. I’ve always found it quite strange, as a matter of fact, that Christianity, Islam, and Judaism ultimately all believe in almost identical things, yet manage to go to war with each other over which specific interpretation of their confusion is the correct one. smh</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I think Judaism and Islam worship a demiurge fake god, but that Jesus taught about the Source. However, this is what religions do, they go to war. Que Human Nature</p>

<blockquote>
<p>None of that means anything if that figure is A) a made up lie and never existed in the first place (which there are a lot of arguments for and against on either side),</p>
</blockquote>

<p>true, but I dont see enough evidence that he was made up and I have seen most of the arguments for this. Shit, even with my NDE&#39;s/OBE&#39;s I didn&#39;t believe back then he was real until I saw him</p>

<blockquote>
<p>it’s recommended to be quite circumspect of any teachings attributed to him since to a large extent they’ve been so distorted as to have little resemblance to what might have actually been said and meant.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You can take one of his teachings,about Love and Loving God, just that alone practiced, produces Oneness, bliss, ego death, and awakening, and is a core tenant in many mystical branches of thought. So even if you wanted to argue the whole &quot;watered down teachings&quot;argument, there is still enough there to produce a set of practices that leads to results to many people around the world.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This is not to disparage Christianity in and of itself. It is rather to let it be known that it is ultimately no better than any other form of indoctrination on this planet is all.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Considering there are a lot of books and reports of people being mystically transformed, ego death, illumination, and awakening by following the teaching of Jesus (producing a form of soul realization and Spiritual Evolution) it most certainly is better than any religion that does not produce anything of the sort.</p>

<p>You’re duped by TPTB’s propaganda into vilifying “this” religion over “that” religion - same as the majority of the citizenry get duped into “this” political stance over “that” political stance.  Reminds me of <a href="https://78.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m8jv618r6h1qfvq9bo1_1280.jpg">this.</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Judaism was shit to begin with though. Its non-inclusive, also creates orthodox idiots, is responsible for Genocide (Caananites) and many other crimes</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I wouldn’t disagree.  All Abrahamic religions (Christianity, Islam, and Judaism all) are exclusivist religions, however - i.e. they’re all non-inclusive.</p>

<p>Seems to me one does a disservice to oneself if they spend too much time vilifying or excluding this or that religion over any other, however.  The whole “people in glass houses” thing seems to come into play here as far as I can see.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The Soul guices people into spiritual paths to learn how to access Soul. Its up to the conscious mind whether it will listen and advance from there</p>

<p>The soul guides it toward where, however?  It guides the physical vehicle it animates toward <em>where it already is</em>.  The physical vehicle is the one that moves toward the structure the soul <em>already has</em>, therefore.</p>

<p>We are exactly where we are supposed to be right now with all things given, and we are hardly where we are supposed to get to, something that still can take 1000-10000 years.</p>

<p>I wholeheartedly disagree with this.  We are far, far behind in the level of technology (physical technology, spiritual technology) we would otherwise be at if we weren’t held back in our forward progress.  Held back by who?  The pdf I linked earlier provides quite a lot of information in that area.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>these days there is a massive increasing movement of people seeking out the mystical branches of various ideologies</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Perhaps.  I would say that if this is the case, it is such because various religions are simply being left behind by people discovering truths on their own and independent of any doctrinal religious perspectives.  Western religions are therefore having to play catch up in an attempt to gather up their floundering discipleship, so I wouldn’t doubt that the ecclesiastical higher ups might be allowing some of the deeper truths hidden within the doctrinal teachings to begin allowed out.</p>

<p>Way too little way too late, however, as far as I’m concerned.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I agree with some aspects of what Joseph is saying for sure, but not everything.</p>

<p>Certainly.  Same here.  I wouldn’t imagine one would or even should agree with <em>every</em> single thing any one individual says.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>For example blaming &quot;capitalism&quot; for being the reason everything is fuckd up I disagree with. All alternatives that have been tried, have produced bullshit, and inequalities as well. Inequality exists within nature, within the order of existence, and it will always be this way for a loooooong ass time until we reach a balanced enlightened population. &quot;Capitalism&quot; has basically become a popular whipping boy.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I agree that inequality is part of nature, but I also feel that Capitalism has done a pretty horrible job of ameliorating many social ills that should otherwise have been dealt with - and in fact it seems this system has created and exacerbated many social ills that would not otherwise have existed.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>He&#39;s also talking about happiness indexes in countries that have a mostly homogenous (denmark/finland) population, whereas U.S. is a mixing pot of different groups, different levels of IQ/Intelligence, different cultures, and many other differences</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The indexes they were referring to were Western indexes, however.  Not anything exclusive to Denmark or Finland.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Yea sure, huma nature takes anything that exists and will eventually fuck it up.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What I said implied nothing like this - and, in fact, this is something that not only do I disagree with at this point, but that I’ve understood for a while the forgers and the propagandists of this civilization have entrained into the minds of the majority of the citizenry.  Most people think exactly like this, but the whole idea that “Human nature just fucks everything up” is something that couldn’t be further from the truth.  Human nature has as much the capacity to live in balance if and when its given the tools for it.  We’re just not given the tools for it in this civilization.</p>

<p>Don’t blame human nature for that.  Blame external covert forces most of us are largely ignorant of.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>that doesn&#39;t mean that there aren&#39;t honest, good people, who still have it good in capitalist countries compared to starving folks in Africa (speaking of relative aspects) including people who have a genuine mystical relationship with God/Enlightenment through their chosen religion.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Africa’s fucked up <em>because</em> of Western Capitalist ventures.  This actually underscores a great deal of the very point Jimmy Done and Peter Joseph talked about.  Yeah those countries are pretty fucked up, but they’re pretty fucked up BECAUSE OF <em>US</em> for the most part - because of Western, American, European hegemonic practices.</p>

<p>I’m very familiar with this study.  In a covert and subtle way, it is basically an argument that says “You can’t be left to your own devices, humanity.  You need us [“us” being TPTB].  If you let us control you, you will live well - just like these mice did.  If you advocate and move toward more independence, however, you will be ruined.  Look at what happened to the poor little mice, after all.”</p>

<p>Interesting, however, how these mice, when left to their own devices in an environment not manipulated by any powerful force above them do quite well in nature.  In the case of these laboratory mice, the force above them is the experimenters.  In the case of humans (human mice), the force above them/us is TPTB above the civilization.</p>

<p>The study’s final message (ultimately flawed, but so subtle that most won’t catch it) says “trust big brother, citizen.  TRUST big brother.  You can do nothing for yourself.  You will be ruined if left to your own devices.”</p>

<p>…….</p>

<p>Your comments attempting to vilify Islam and Judaism and raise Christianity above them are just…bad.  Just bad.</p>

<p>I see you are simply unwilling to understand just how flawed your logic and perspective are.  The cancer of ignorance and exclusivism spreads in much of the ways you think regarding religion, so I’ll simply shrug my shoulders - *meh - and let it be for now.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>You mistakenly blame human nature for the influence of an external covert element you’re simply not accounting for.

<p>It can if you interpret it correctly.  Unfortunately, most don’t since there is so much propaganda pushing most toward a distorted interpretation of even these basic statements above.</p>

<p>Hardly.  Again, and as I just stated above here, the “love and light” comment attributed to the figure has been so watered down and polluted with so many other false ideas that the majority of people can’t intelligibly separate the wheat from the chaff of Christianity or any real statements made therein.</p>

<p>Again, much better to ultimately find one’s path elsewhere.</p>

This is were Mystical systems of Spiritual Paths come in and teach people transcendence, Love, Enlightenment, about beings like Christ, Buddha, and many others, and this helps to enter into a period of awakening, instead of living in this sort of black hole Nihilism where nothing is true, everything is a lie, and nothing has meaning anymore.</p>

<p>We are in a transition right now - so things seem far worse today than they were in days past. However, be sure that it’s this transition that’s necessary to allow the species to wake up, grow up, and evolve to something better and more developed.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Oh I agree. The Awakening will be a Spiritual/Consciousness one. I douby we will see the fruits of that in our lifetimes though. I&#39;m sure there will still be a World War against Islam, another WW against A.I., various dark periods, colonization to other worlds, before we even come close to how we know it can be</p>

<p>I’m very familiar with this study. In a covert and subtle way, it is basically an argument that says “You can’t be left to your own devices, humanity. You need us [“us” being TPTB]. If you let us control you, you will live well - just like these mice did. If you advocate and move toward more independence, however, you will be ruined. Look at what happened to the poor little mice, after all.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I dont think its that at all. I think its more a &quot;this is what happens when the population gets too big with limited resources.&quot; Many aspects of which we are currently witnessing in our society.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Interesting, however, how these mice, when left to their own devices in an environment not manipulated by any powerful force above them do quite well in nature. </p>

<p>Nature has a dog eat dog, survival of the fittest, predators, famine, natural population control, and many other factors happening there that do not occur for humans</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“trust big brother, citizen. TRUST big brother. You can do nothing for yourself. You will be ruined if left to your own devices.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I can see where you got that from. But my take is that message is that we are the rats in the controlled environment with an uncontrolled population explosion with nothing in nature balancing us with our environment.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Your comments attempting to vilify Islam and Judaism and raise Christianity above them are just…bad. Just bad.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Not really. I&#39;ve had these talks with professors and some have agreed with my take. You can boil it down to someone walking into a restaurant who sits down and gets a &quot;Choose Your Religion&quot; menu. You can then pick and choose the one you want based on the ingredients. And basically, Christianity hs less GMO&#39;s and MSG than the other two.</p>

<p>Personally, I support any system that leads to awakening, love, unity, enlightenment, and illumination. Any system that doesn&#39;t do that, is a brainwashing cult that imprisons the member, including denominations of Christianity that do this as well</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You mistakenly blame human nature for the influence of an external covert element you’re simply not accounting for. The fact that you ignore a link I already referenced earlier pretty heavily showing (if not definitively proving) the existence of this external covert element indicates to me that you’ve no real interest in giving up what you’re emotionally tied to in favor of what’s actually objectively valid.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Which link the Dore/Joseph interview? I already watched that.</p>

<p>Human nature (psychology) finds reasons to go to war, religion, borders, profit, division, nationalism, philosophy, etc. I am not mistaken in this and there are volumes of Phd level material supporting this</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Even if he exists (which he may or may not), it means little in light of the Vivekananda statement I already quoted prior.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What Vivekananda said in that statement, so what? Sure I believe it, but if I asked you to prove it to a skeptic, you wouldn&#39;t be able to. And those who &quot;silent heroes&quot; that helped from the shadows, great! When I had my OBE&#39;s/NDE I saw a lot of Saints glowing with White light that are clearly existing in a heightened state of existence compared to souls of regular folks who have recently passed who look like lifeless barely glowing jellyfish</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It can if you interpret it correctly. Unfortunately, most don’t since there is so much propaganda pushing most toward a distorted interpretation of even these basic statements above.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But you don&#39;t know. Out of all those who follow the teachings around the world, you don&#39;t know who is awakened from this method and who isn&#39;t so its a moot point. Fortunately we have from various cultures very in depth teachings about how practicing love alone can awaken the soul/illumination/enlightenment lending further credence to Jesus teachings.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Hardly. Again, and as I just stated above here, the “love and light” comment attributed to the figure has been so watered down and polluted with so many other false ideas that the majority of people can’t intelligibly separate the wheat from the chaff of Christianity or any real statements made therein.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So have all other teachings. And yet tho this day, people use all sorts of these watered down teachings to realize enlightenment. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Again, much better to ultimately find one’s path elsewhere.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Wrong, different paths exist for different kinds of people. A rigid intellectual who does not know faith and is more scientific minded, will perhaps enjoy more a Yoga systematic approach or a buddhist one pointed concentration approach whereas someone who is more intuitive and loving will find the Jesus approach more tenable.</p>

<p>And that&#39;s fine and you should be okay with this. Instead you are trying to fight against something that already is in place.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It is, again, only but one aspect or help/training wheels for the developing individual. There are far more available to people on this planet than that provided by the christian perspective.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The Christian path works for many people, so why be so against it, makes zero sense to me</p>

<p>Which I dont care about, because I am not a Christian Saint here to represent Christ. I am here to argue for the fact that there are beings who become Enlightened Beings and Saints through the practice of Jesus teachings that include ego death, illumination, OBE&#39;s, and Oneness with God and can prove it with a Myriad of writings, many of the experiences also coinciding with that of other mystics from other branches as well, along with coinciding with what I have seen in the Spirit realms via OBE&#39;s and correlating with what others have seen in their OBE&#39;s/NDE&#39;s.</p>

<p>So its hardly ironic, because truly, I don&#39;t care what or how you see me as, since it will merely be your own assumption, but not at all the objective truth of the matter.</p>

<p>I think its ironic that you agree to things like enlightenment and Spiritual beings while also quoting vivekananda, while at the same time dismissing Jesus, because some people have committed atrocities under the guise of Christianity in the past. Which means that when I bring up the atrocities of Hinduism:</p>

<p><a href="http://nastikasmission.blogspot.com/2011/04/hindu-atrocities.html">http://nastikasmission.blogspot.com/2011/04/hindu-atrocities.html</a></p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Violence_against_Muslims_in_India">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Violence_against_Muslims_in_India</a></p>

<p>It means that you should also be rejecting Hinduism and Vivekananda for what he represents as well, along with Buddhism. But I doubt you will do that. Instead, I think you just have some sort of personal agenda against Christianity itself  perhaps because of your upbringing, education, or some sort of other subconscious imperatives causing you to illogically support one system that has caused atrocities in its name while rejecting another</p>

<blockquote>
<p>…You might want to really give that some serious thought.</p>

<p>Oh I have, for decades, and have had these debates and wrestled with these things for decades as well. Honestly, I&#39;m also playing devil&#39;s advocate here as well, but at the end of the day, the hypocrisy shows that perhaps you should rethink your entire stance on these things.</p>

<p>“Goodness without knowledge is weak and feeble, but knowledge without goodness is dangerous.”</p>

<p>Intelligence is a fast car.  Wisdom is a knowledgeable driver.  Too many individuals make the mistake of valuing a IQ solely, entirely unaware of the fact that it means nothing if you don’t know how to navigate your life wisely.

<p>You make the mistake of equating a “saint” with an “enlightened being”.  Not the same thing in the least.

<p>It actually was better &quot;then&quot; in various respects. The Black neighborhoods in the 60&#39;s/70&#39;s which were Christian, had higher dual parent households and less crime. More families were together and there was less CIA/NWO meddling. Feminism was a CIA psy op, the Crack and Gnaster Rap was also a CIA psy op, and Post Modern Cultural programmers created various movements to make society more broken and degenerate </p>

<blockquote>
<p>It’s definitely hurtful and painful to find out that you’ve been living in a lie, and the transition might be really rough and ugly, but this road is ultimately the very road one must go on if they hope to improve and get better.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Not sure what you&#39;re talking about here, but it definitely does hurt when people come to this sub and realize everything they have been fed via Gov, School, TV and so forth is a lie. Many often then become Nihilists and break down. This is were Mystical systems of Spiritual Paths come in and teach people transcendence, Love, Enlightenment, about beings like Christ, Buddha, and many others, and this helps to enter into a period of awakening, instead of living in this sort of black hole Nihilism where nothing is true, everything is a lie, and nothing has meaning anymore.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>We are in a transition right now - so things seem far worse today than they were in days past. However, be sure that it’s this transition that’s necessary to allow the species to wake up, grow up, and evolve to something better and more developed.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Oh I agree. The Awakening will be a Spiritual/Consciousness one. I douby we will see the fruits of that in our lifetimes though. I&#39;m sure there will still be a World War against Islam, another WW against A.I., various dark periods, colonization to other worlds, before we even come close to how we know it can be</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I’m very familiar with this study. In a covert and subtle way, it is basically an argument that says “You can’t be left to your own devices, humanity. You need us [“us” being TPTB]. If you let us control you, you will live well - just like these mice did. If you advocate and move toward more independence, however, you will be ruined. Look at what happened to the poor little mice, after all.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I dont think its that at all. I think its more a &quot;this is what happens when the population gets too big with limited resources.&quot; Many aspects of which we are currently witnessing in our society.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Interesting, however, how these mice, when left to their own devices in an environment not manipulated by any powerful force above them do quite well in nature. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Nature has a dog eat dog, survival of the fittest, predators, famine, natural population control, and many other factors happening there that do not occur for humans</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“trust big brother, citizen. TRUST big brother. You can do nothing for yourself. You will be ruined if left to your own devices.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I can see where you got that from. But my take is that message is that we are the rats in the controlled environment with an uncontrolled population explosion with nothing in nature balancing us with our environment.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Your comments attempting to vilify Islam and Judaism and raise Christianity above them are just…bad. Just bad.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Not really. I&#39;ve had these talks with professors and some have agreed with my take. You can boil it down to someone walking into a restaurant who sits down and gets a &quot;Choose Your Religion&quot; menu. You can then pick and choose the one you want based on the ingredients. And basically, Christianity hs less GMO&#39;s and MSG than the other two.</p>

<p>Personally, I support any system that leads to awakening, love, unity, enlightenment, and illumination. Any system that doesn&#39;t do that, is a brainwashing cult that imprisons the member, including denominations of Christianity that do this as well</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You mistakenly blame human nature for the influence of an external covert element you’re simply not accounting for. The fact that you ignore a link I already referenced earlier pretty heavily showing (if not definitively proving) the existence of this external covert element indicates to me that you’ve no real interest in giving up what you’re emotionally tied to in favor of what’s actually objectively valid.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Which link the Dore/Joseph interview? I already watched that.</p>

<p>Human nature (psychology) finds reasons to go to war, religion, borders, profit, division, nationalism, philosophy, etc. I am not mistaken in this and there are volumes of Phd level material supporting this</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Even if he exists (which he may or may not), it means little in light of the Vivekananda statement I already quoted prior.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What Vivekananda said in that statement, so what? Sure I believe it, but if I asked you to prove it to a skeptic, you wouldn&#39;t be able to. And those who &quot;silent heroes&quot; that helped from the shadows, great! When I had my OBE&#39;s/NDE I saw a lot of Saints glowing with White light that are clearly existing in a heightened state of existence compared to souls of regular folks who have recently passed who look like lifeless barely glowing jellyfish</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It can if you interpret it correctly. Unfortunately, most don’t since there is so much propaganda pushing most toward a distorted interpretation of even these basic statements above.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But you don&#39;t know. Out of all those who follow the teachings around the world, you don&#39;t know who is awakened from this method and who isn&#39;t so its a moot point. Fortunately we have from various cultures very in depth teachings about how practicing love alone can awaken the soul/illumination/enlightenment lending further credence to Jesus teachings.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Hardly. Again, and as I just stated above here, the “love and light” comment attributed to the figure has been so watered down and polluted with so many other false ideas that the majority of people can’t intelligibly separate the wheat from the chaff of Christianity or any real statements made therein.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So have all other teachings. And yet tho this day, people use all sorts of these watered down teachings to realize enlightenment. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Again, much better to ultimately find one’s path elsewhere.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Wrong, different paths exist for different kinds of people. A rigid intellectual who does not know faith and is more scientific minded, will perhaps enjoy more a Yoga systematic approach or a buddhist one pointed concentration approach whereas someone who is more intuitive and loving will find the Jesus approach more tenable.</p>

<p>And that&#39;s fine and you should be okay with this. Instead you are trying to fight against something that already is in place.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It is, again, only but one aspect or help/training wheels for the developing individual. There are far more available to people on this planet than that provided by the christian perspective.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The Christian path works for many people, so why be so against it, makes zero sense to me</p>
