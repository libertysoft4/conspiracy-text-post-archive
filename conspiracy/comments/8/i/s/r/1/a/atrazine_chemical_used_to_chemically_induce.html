<p>SS: Alex Jones was right, Atrazine turns the frickin frogs gay. This stuff is also found in tap water, strawberries, various foods in the foods supply. Remember to filter your tap water (I use 3 stage reverse osmosis). </p>

<p>Perhaps this explains the explosion in LGBTQ folks, its the Chems in the Water + Food Supply</p>

<p>It&#39;s likely more complicated than this. From wikipedia -</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The Maya Chilam Balam books, for example, regularly contained sexual insults directed toward the Itzá. According to mythology contained in the book, sodomites were responsible for destroying the order of Maya society by producing illegitimate children through their anuses who were unable to run society.</p>

<p>Certainly there is if you don&#39;t want to be, and yet the feelings/thoughts/associations are there. There are actually a lot of suicides or thoughts of committing suicides in the trans community:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.teni.ie/page.aspx?contentid=673">http://www.teni.ie/page.aspx?contentid=673</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>The preliminary results from the Trans Mental Health and Well-being survey* have found high levels of suicide ideation and attempted suicide within transgender communities in Ireland. The data revealed that 78% of trans people have thought about ending their lives and 40% have attempted suicide. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>As well as transitioning regret:</p>

<p><a href="http://thefederalist.com/2015/08/19/transgender-regret-is-real-even-if-the-media-tell-you-otherwise/">http://thefederalist.com/2015/08/19/transgender-regret-is-real-even-if-the-media-tell-you-otherwise/</a></p>

<p>If many of these cases are because of Atrazine, then this most certainly is wrong when a person who would have otherwise carried on a typical straight life is now inundated with these kinds of feelings which are chemically induced via big AG</p>

    <div class="md"><p>See, if you&#39;re just going to continue to attack (or maybe something along those lines without the aggression behind an attack) perception of words then we are wasting each others times.</p>

<p>Yeah, rocks aren&#39;t here to reproduce though are they? Life, a part of natural, in the way of nature, has only one mission : reproduction.</p>

<p>If something goes against the prime directive, it is going against the norm or Is classed as not normal. Going against nature is not natural, by definition.</p>

<p>So, life has a prime directive, which is to reproduce. If you don&#39;t or can&#39;t reproduce you are not normal, not natural or unnatural by the very definitions of the words. That means, homosexuality, which cannot reproduce, by definition, is the same as going against the prime directive of reproduction and is thus not natural.</p>

<p>Again, I will reiterate; this is not a social commentary on whether or not homosexuality is wrong, immoral or unacceptable.</p>

<p>This is, however, clearly stating that homosexuality in nature, not just humans, is unnatural. </p>

<p>What the hell are you talking about? Life is just something that happens - a physical/chemical process like the formation of stars or rocks or hurricanes. There is no Prime Director and there are no prime directives, just a chain of cause and effect that stretches forwards and back into the infinite abyss of time.
