        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I wanted to make this post for a long time because I have realized the depth of media manipulation and propaganda, it goes farther beyond what most people even think they do, and in fact it is so deep that even the TPTB are affected by their own lies. It&#39;s like we live in a self-perpetuating lie machine. I have to get this off my chest.</p>

<p>I am not watching TV frequently but every now and then I go and see what my wife is watching in the living room (I don&#39;t allow TV in the bedroom), and it is almost like a mesmerizing hypnotic brainwashing that is going on, it&#39;s so unreal from a outside observer, and I bet she doesn&#39;t even realize it, I have said it to her many times but she always shrugged it off, not like she thinks I am crazy, she agrees with me in many topics, but more like she knows it&#39;s true, but still doesn&#39;t care about it, she loves the hypnosis.</p>

<p>When I went to my friends house for a weekend chat and beer, he always had to had the freakin TV on. I am just so annoyed by it now. We were just drinking beer and talking about our week and stuff in general, but we can&#39;t do that nicely in quiet or perhaps in the garden, the fkin TV always has to be on, as he was just catching up with the latest soccer game.</p>

<p>I kind of like feel from the guy from the &quot;They Live (1988)&quot; movie. I am not mentally ill or paranoid, many shills already called me that, but that is not true, I am just disillusioned with the web of deception and braiwashing that has encroached humanity.</p>

<p>I am really disgusted by it, you can call it &quot;I woke up&quot; now, it&#39;s like seeing &quot;the matrix&quot; around you. Yes it&#39;s the fucking Television. I have talked about this in the past but let&#39;s do it again because it is just so horrible that this can&#39;t be left without words.</p>

<p><strong>The Television is the greatest scienfically engineered mass-brainwashing aparatus that has been erected since the history of humanity in order to brainwash, propagandize, control and influence the minds of people. It&#39;s a mind-control mechanism, as a literal meaning as it gets.</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>There was a post here a while ago that was talking about some ex-spook that admitted that the TV is a mind-control apparatus</li>
<li>Also some ex-spooks in their books have wrote that none of them have TV in their homes</li>
</ul>

<p>So basically nobody intelligent enough and wise enough is watching TV. The TV is almost like an IQ test, anyone who has a TV in his or her house is already a person who is not the wisest around, and the more TV a person watches the dumber it is, sometimes a self-fulfilling prophecy as studies have confirmed that TV is lowering cognitive abilities.</p>

<h1>Let&#39;s review the characteristics of the TV:</h1>

<ul>
<li>It&#39;s full of &quot;programs&quot; organized by a specific and repetitive format subdivided by topics into 2: serious &amp; non serious</li>
<li>The serious programs (news reports / political analysis) is often mixed with non-serious programs (entertainment /pop stuff) in order to confuse the subject and to blur the line between facts and fiction, so that the subject will lose it&#39;s ability to tell apart real events from fake ones</li>
<li>The serious programs are always presented in a quiet background sound, with bright colors, casters in authoritative clothing and accesories, with strong articulated and confident voices so that the newscast or political commentary always looks like &quot;experts&quot; know things better thus you should believe them.</li>
<li>Serious programs always have a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_conditioning">Pavlovian rally sound</a> before , inside and after the program in order to call the &quot;dogs&quot; to attention. Yes you are like a conditioned dog in their eyes.</li>
<li><p>Serious programs also use all tricks under their sleeves from verbal propaganda, dirty debating tactics, all logical fallacies, and all other verbal and visual tricks to deceive you. They throw basically the entire propaganda manual at you during a 90 minute political analysis talk for instance.</p></li>
<li><p>Non serious programs rely more on emotional manipulation and subtle if not subconscious propaganda. Subliminal messages, etc... </p></li>
<li><p>All characters in entertainment follow a specific patterns, well crafted to fit their agenda, and they all pander to basic psychological weaknesses of humans:</p>

<ul>
<li>Kids: Ads telling and illustrating to you how much you love your kids, so make sure you vaccinate them..</li>
<li>Elderly: You love your grandma so much and she smiles at you and you don&#39;t want to lose her too early, so make sure she gets the flu shot...</li>
<li>Wife: Your love of your life just got breast cancer, but don&#39;t give up just take her to chemotherapy even though the survival rate of chemo is well below 10%..</li>
<li>Africans: They will show you a lot of pictures of starving kids, therefore you must support the GMO research initiatives</li>
<li>Pets: Kitties are dying, oh my God! And it&#39;s all due to Global Warming (which has predicted Netherlands under water by 1970), now let&#39;s accept a 5% carbon tax now, for the kitties!</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>This is both in ads as in regular movies and TV shows, I have literally seen all examples written above. I am not joking they are now doubling down on the brainwashing.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>The TV is tuned into 50/60 HZ which is proven to create a very suggestive state where people can be more influenced as it interferes with people&#39;s brainwaves. In fact the entire electrical grid is purposely tuned into this frequency.</p></li>
<li><p>There are daily and weekly talking points, which is a horrible propaganda tool, and after the time of the news is over it&#39;s quickly pulled out, and never to be remembered again. It basically forces you to talk and think about something and then it quickly makes you forget it after it&#39;s over. I think this causes serious brain damage in many people. Thoughts would naturally arise and fade away slowly,but the TV literally swaps major topics so frequently, than even the biggest news lose importance after 1 week or so.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory_hole">Memory Hole</a>: Old news are forgotten and then rewritten in order to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaslighting">gaslight</a> humanity in perpetuum. Most of history is fake due to this effect.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>It&#39;s literally Orwellian, everything that Orwell wrote is true now, it also became a Telescreen with the new Smart-TV&#39;s now, so perhaps in the future the propaganda could be even more individually tailored, instead of having 1 program for every citizen, it could be showing totally different things to different viewers as AI progresses.</p>

<p>The ultimate brainwashing would be individually tailored propaganda, it&#39;s already tailored by subgroups (kids watch cartoons in the morning, elderly in the afternoons and normal adults at the evening) it would be even more efficient if they would create a massive AI that would create automatic CGI-based propaganda individually tailored to every viewer. I guess this will come in the future.</p>

<h1>But for now everything that Orwell wrote is true:</h1>

<ul>
<li>The news is repetitive and repeats the lies in a very hypnotizing manner</li>
<li>Everything that is objectively important is totally ignored, total media blackout</li>
<li>Everything that is trivial (like entertainment and pop garbage) is mass saturating the screen, just totally mass produced without end, soap operas, music shows, just flooding it entirely.</li>
<li>Completely fabricated news stories are presented as real and they can talk about it for months, introducing total hoaxes portrayed as real</li>
<li>Bald faced pathological liars, who can lie even in their sleep, as anchors</li>
</ul>

<p>So when I go over to a friend and they all have their TV&#39;s on all day. They don&#39;t even realize it, it&#39;s just on as a background noise, somehow they don&#39;t feel comfortable now in silence they must have the damn TV spewing noise out all day. </p>

<p>And the TV literally uses rally sounds to call the sheeps to attention when something important is happening. You must watch the 1984 movie, it&#39;s exactly like that, when the voice in the TV said something like: &quot;Attention Citizen, the Forces of Eurasia have been defeated, more news at 6 o&#39;clock!&quot;</p>

<p>It&#39;s basically just rally points like that which are BS and they might not even be real, but the point is to call the sheep to rally to make sure it obeys you. So the TV is totally conditioning people like this, make sure you watch the &quot;6 o&#39;clock news citizen&quot;.</p>

<p>Another disturbing element I found is when they list you the timetable of the programs. I was just at my friend when this happened, the TV guy started listing out the timetable of the programs for the entire week. Sure you can look that up on the internet, but I don&#39;t think this was for informing purposes it was again like a Pavlovian conditioning, to get the sheep know it&#39;s routine:
* You must watch the 8 o&#39;clock morning talk show!
* You must watch the 6 o&#39;clock news
* You must watch the 8 o&#39;clock political commentary
* You must watch movie X at 10 o&#39;clock</p>

<p>I mean it&#39;s basically shaping people&#39;s minds but it&#39;s also like a drill, it drills the programs into your head so that you will be like a dog that responds to certain stimulii. It will make you addicted to the shows and it will make you very focused when an update is coming out.</p>

<p>It was so bizarre for me to just see all of that going on at my friend with an open eye. After deprogramming it certainly shows you a different world and now I can see every single propaganda element in the TV, all of it. It was like an epiphany, the moment you realize how deep the brainwashing is, and how your reality is fabricated by a fucking box, and you are not even angry about that how silly that sounds, then you will realize the truth.</p>

<p>You are a slave Neo, a prisoner in a mental prison created by a 100 cm black box.</p>

<p>Yeah those fucking reality shows make me vomit literally.</p>

<p>Fucking fabricated stories, like you miss 1 week and after 1 week it&#39;s still the same crap just in a different situation.</p>

<p>It&#39;s full of hysteria and screaming people and cringy conflicts, it&#39;s just so pathetic and infuriating at the same time.</p>

<p>But then again you see old people literally being furious at the TV show characters.</p>

<p>I am just furious at the entire TV itself, it&#39;s the machine that is the problem.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It feels so unreal to me how the hell can other people watch that box all day. I remember my old self watching it, I haven&#39;t even realized how much time I have wasted watching repetitive never-ending mass produced fiction just destroing my cognitive abilities. I probably lost like 10 IQ points due to the TV as  I watched a lot of TV as a kid, and child development is probably hindered by it.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Yes but I have argued in the past that it&#39;s still better than the TV. The TV is the worst of them all. Even the establishment shills on YT are amateurs now, but if you look closely on the front page (from a clean connection and no cookies) they have local mainstream TV channels now hosting their shows.</p>

<p>So the mainstream efficient propaganda machine is now going to Youtube.</p>

<p>Still a computer doesn&#39;t have that hyptonic effect as the TV does, so I&#39;d argue that it&#39;s still a lesser evil.</p>

<p>Winston was always skeptical of the news being fake. In the end scene however when Winston got brainwashed, he was now concerned about it.</p>

<p>Funny you should say that. On this sub, the thing which seems to get most &#39;awake&#39; people howling like offended flower petals is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ad1iCYcdyiM">the questioning of what is shown on our telescreens</a>.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>LOL well let&#39;s not throw everything out yet. Missiles are not a hoax. There is just so much evidence for their existence, it&#39;s not like every miliary person can just lie about it simultaneously.</p>

<p>But I agree with you that many ICBM&#39;s are probably exagerated in their capability.</p>

<p>Remember they came out in the 60&#39;s or whatnot and they were fearmongering then that the Soviets could strike the other side of the planet with a rocket, it was just so obvious fearmongering.</p>

<p>The moon landing, even space itself is very fictionalized but military rockets do exist, unfortunately though, I wish they wouldn&#39;t.</p>

<p>I think that ICBM&#39;s are exagerated though. I guess the rockets that they show in military parades are just empty decoys anyway.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That is not what I meant, what I meant was: &quot;it&#39;s good to have an open mind, just make sure your brain doesn&#39;t fall off&quot;.</p>

<p>Just because there is 1 fakery out there that doesn&#39;t mean that the whole show is fake. The truth is somewhere along the middle, it would be too hard for them to fake everything, but just enough to deceive you, so given their efforts it would be like that.</p>

<p>I do agree with you that there is a lot of fakery in rocket technology but that doesn&#39;t mean that all of it is fake.</p>

<p>Missiles probably fly in straight lines like bullets so those fired from fighter planes are real, and given that many soldiers use them it would be hard to fake.</p>

<p>Now ICBM&#39;s and other stuff, I think they are real,but extremely inaccurate, like the one you saw recently when the US bombed some Syrian airbases most missiles dropped miles away.</p>

<p>So the hoax part of the cold war was probably how they were lying about how they can incinerate cities on the other parts of the globe in the 60&#39;s, but in 2017/2018 they can&#39;t even hit a major airbase from a nearby ship I believe. Now that could be a hoax.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m loosing the plot I&#39;m afraid. I sure hope not of course, but may I ask how in the Hell do missiles relate to this threads subject? :/ Not just missiles but also the idea of them being a fkn hoax?! </p>

<p>In keeping with what I thought was a TV themed thread, we&#39;re seemingly tuned into two very different channels here! </p>

<p>Missiles a hoax....if you&#39;ve simply used that as an example of people keeping there mind so open their brain has fallen out, I understand, although it&#39;s an obscure example to use. Is it meant to be funny? Because yeah it is quite funny! Or is it meant to be a shocking example of absolute stupidity?</p>

<p>If it was none of the above and just intended to do nothing but totally mind fuck someone, then I concede defeat and admire your job well done! </p>

<p>A guy pointed to me out earlier that it totally distorts the way the justice system works, and many juries are affected by it:</p>

<p>It portrays cops as superhumans, and in instills an almost Orwellian big brother effect into the listeners, making them think that they surely can&#39;t get away with any crime given how sophisticated the LE is.</p>

<p>When in reality 50% of murders aren&#39;t even investigated, and most detectives are just sitting at their desks filling out paperwork.</p>

T.V. is so ingrained in americans lives that it is pathetic but then again they said that at some point the slaves would enjoy their servitude and administer it to themselves. I fucking hate television. That shit is annoying to even hear much less try to watch or tune out when talking to a friend. I mean there is a reason they call it &quot;programming&quot; in the first place. Also now that i think of it. I used to have the documents saved where it lroved that televisons are designed to be two way not one way. When you are watxhing tv. Someone else is watching you. We allowed survellance into every single one of our own homes without even questioning it. I will have to look for that document since the popos still have my old phone i had it saved too.

    <div class="md"><p>All quotes are from 1984 by George Orwell.</p>

<p>&quot;The voice came from an oblong metal plaque like a dulled mirror which formed part of the surface of the right-hand wall. Winston turned a switch and the voice sank somewhat, though the words were still distinguishable. The instrument (the telescreen, it was called) could be dimmed, but there was no way of shutting it off completely.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;He thought of the telescreen with its never-sleeping ear. They could spy upon you night and day, but if you kept your head you could still outwit them. With all their cleverness they had never mastered the secret of finding out what another human being was thinking. . . . Facts, at any rate, could not be kept hidden. They could be tracked down by inquiry, they could be squeezed out of you by torture.&quot;</p>

<p>Hmm if only somebody could invent a little black box you could hold in your hand (or a speaker to put in your house) to ask your every thought. And of course the mic couldn&#39;t be turned off, in case you had a question...</p>

<p>&quot;Life, if you looked about you, bore no resemblance not only to the lies that streamed out of the telescreens, but even to the ideals that the Party was trying to achieve.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;How do we know that two and two make four? Or that the force of gravity works? Or that the past is unchangeable? If both the past and the external world exist only in the mind, and if the mind itself is controllable – what then?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;And if all others accepted the lie which the Party imposed—if all records told the same tale—then the lie passed into history and became truth. &#39;Who controls the past&#39; ran the Party slogan, &#39;controls the future: who controls the present controls the past.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;From the proletarians nothing is to be feared. Left to themselves, they will continue from generation to generation and from century to century, working, breeding, and dying, not only without any impulse to rebel, but without the power of grasping that the world could be other than it is.&quot;</p>

<p>“The ideal set up by the Party was something huge, terrible, and glittering—a world of steel and concrete, of monstrous machines and terrifying weapons—a nation of warriors and fanatics, marching forward in perfect unity, all thinking the same thoughts and shouting the same slogans, perpetually working, fighting, triumphing, persecuting—three hundred million people all with the same face.”</p>

<p>He was a bit off here it&#39;s 2 faces, Liberal vs Conservative. That was everyone is too busy yelling at eachother to notice what&#39;s going on.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have not and never will watch or even attempt to watch every show on television so I&#39;m coming in unarmed here but a gay on EVERY show you say?

Your statement is simply far from true as it stands and I&#39;m not qualified to offer a diagnosis but perhaps you&#39;re suffering from paranoia of some sort?</p>

<p>As for a black commentator seemingly on every NBA and NFL broadcast team whilst making up only 12% of the population, I fail to see the propaganda or agenda that is so &#39;obvious&#39; to you. As Lurk pointed out, what are the percentage of black athletes in each respective sport? </p>

<p>Yes, NBA/NFL players are not the general population, I totally agree as do I agree that most mass media on the whole is aimed at the general population, beings that it&#39;s commercial TV it&#39;s simple economic sensibility, is it not? I&#39;ve totally no idea what point you&#39;re attempting to make with them being the 1% of the 1%.  Are you suggesting that as sports are aimed at the general population then the commentary team should be made up of randomly selected members of that general population? You&#39;ll have to clear it up mate as I&#39;m a bit lost and just guessing what you mean.</p>

<p>Lets for shits and giggles do some math. In this example I&#39;m guessing your apparent shock that there&#39;s seemingly at least one black on each broadcast is also more often than not also a retired ex player.</p>

<p>I guesstimate that 75% of players in each team NBA team are black. I&#39;m not American and haven&#39;t watched any of your sporting broadcasts for years but I&#39;d guess and to keep the math simple, there would perhaps be a team of 5 on each broadcast team for the home and away season. Is it that out of the realm of possibility to imagine in a sport that&#39;s made up of 75% blacks that the broadcast team would then be made up of 20% black employees? No doubt employed for their expert special comments and insights having played the game at the highest level. Very few of the 25% of whites will retire and do commentary, I&#39;m not aware of a Larry Bird, Steve Kerr, Luc Longley or Bill Wennington moving into commentary(I could be wrong) What would be described as your general commentator, for the general public, in fact make up a whopping 80% of the commentary team! Where I live there&#39;s a couple of high grade respected commentators that never played professionally but by and large it&#39;s made up of retired players, for the consensus is people like to hear from people who have lived and breathed the game at the highest level. </p>

<p>Fucked if I know what your meaning to indicate in regards to the one black per team, 12% of the population, who then become 1% of the 1%. I get the feeling your suggesting they&#39;re over represented and somehow this is propaganda? Sorry if i&#39;m wrong.  A few minutes thought a couple of numbers, that whilst not exact I&#39;m confident of them being around the mark and anyone can see they&#39;re grossly under represented in the broadcast team considering the huge number that have lived and breathed the game and not a scribe on the sidelines beating around for a story.</p>

<p>Obviously it&#39;s a figure of speech, but it seems like a large amount of shows are having gay characters, to the point that shows without gay characters are the outcasts. It would be worth looking into as it seems they are very over-represented.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Here&#39;s the problem. You are arguing for proportional representation in sports, but then saying I&#39;m paranoid for saying other groups are over-represented in regular TV shows. You can&#39;t have it both ways.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Are you suggesting that as sports are aimed at the general population then the commentary team should be made up of randomly selected members of that general population?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I think Whites and Hispanics and even Asians to a degree are underrepresented, while Blacks are over represented. This also didn&#39;t used to be like this. The amount of blacks doing commentary in the 80&#39;s, 90&#39;s and 00&#39;s was much smaller than it is today, even though the leagues had similar racial numbers. This implies to me that various companies are over-compensating.</p>

<p>Women are also very under-represented if we are going by the general population or over-represented if we are considering your theory that it&#39;s only proportional to the amount of players from said group in the league.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In this example I&#39;m guessing your apparent shock that there&#39;s seemingly at least one black on each broadcast is also more often than not also a retired ex player?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Look commentary is a pretty mindless job. I used to do it. Anyone can do it. There&#39;s no IQ requirements or true education requirements to be a good commentator.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I&#39;m not American and haven&#39;t watched any of your sporting broadcasts for years but I&#39;d guess and to keep the math simple, there would perhaps be a team of 5 on each broadcast team for the home and away season.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;m looking more at broadcast teams, which are usually 2 people and the default is always one black and one White.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Very few of the 25% of whites will retire and do commentary</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Is it because they don&#39;t want to or is it because they aren&#39;t the right skin color? I think most players of any race would accept a commentary gig since it&#39;s easy work.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I&#39;m not aware of a Larry Bird, Steve Kerr, Luc Longley or Bill Wennington moving into commentary(I could be wrong) </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Steve Kerr did commentary work prior to joining the Warriors.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>who then become 1% of the 1%.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There&#39;s millions of football and basketball players in the US. Less than 1% become pro players.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I get the feeling your suggesting they&#39;re over represented and somehow this is propaganda?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes, I think this is propaganda. All of the big tv stations here are quite liberal and liberals L O V E minorities, even ones who are against all of their causes like Muslims.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>A few minutes thought a couple of numbers, that whilst not exact I&#39;m confident of them being around the mark and anyone can see they&#39;re grossly under represented in the broadcast team considering the huge number that have lived and breathed the game and not an ex print scribe on the sidelines beating around for a story who&#39;s moved through the ranks.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Again, you think their representation is proportional to the players in the league. I think they aren&#39;t proportional to the general population.</p>

<p>I also do want to say that I think there is a bias towards blacks in sports. I think they have to show that they <em>can&#39;t play</em>, while Whites and others have to show that they <em>can play</em></p>

<p>Somehow being gay is supposed to be better than being straight now. Aren&#39;t we all supposed to be equal?</p>

<p>And don&#39;t forget all the woman power shows on the tube now. Somehow all of these 90 lb women are supposed to be physically stronger than 250 lb brutes? I&#39;m all for equality but ffs come on already.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>According to a Bureau of Labor Statistics report, the average American’s day includes six minutes playing sports, five minutes reading books, one minute making music, 30 seconds attending a play or concert, 25 seconds making or viewing art, and <strong>four hours</strong> watching television.</p>

<p>I agree with the author that TV has been the primary tool of control over the last 70 years or so, roughly equivalent in magnitude to the internet in social terms (just consider people who are old enough to remember a time without it, verses those who have always had the internet, phones, etc).</p>

<p>But I would point out, that TV is just one tool in a long historical arc. This is just my model, but you might find it interesting. I see history (and civilization) as being primarily about the centralization of power and intelligence, and (over time) the deemphasis of consciousness. After all, what value is consciousness to &#39;the system?&#39; Intelligence has great value and that intelligence is constantly being centralized and specialized. But consciousness, at best only occasionally contributes to growth, and at worst, actually impedes growth. Therefore, in the eyes of the ruling powers, not only of our civilization, but of all civilizations (since they all want to grow and expand their power), consciousness must be minimized.</p>

<p>TV is an important step in transforming common language into more efficient (but shallower) forms of communication. The image can communicate very simple ideas very quickly, but without depth. This makes it super efficient, but only surface deep. It deemphasizes consciousness, which is very bad for those who care about freedom, self-determination, liberty, etc.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There are 2 ways to control people: by force and by mind.</p>

<p>Historically religion was the mind control apparatus, but since the 20th century it has been replaced by mass media, where the TV had the biggest role and now online movies and shows to some degree.</p>

<p>The TPTB prefer mind control over physical force since it&#39;s more efficient and cheaper than brutal force. Furthermore if people know they are slaves, they won&#39;t be productive. Animal&#39;s don&#39;t breed in captivity. The system has to be designed to distract people from knowing that they are slaves.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I love TV. I grew up on it since the 70s. It&#39;s an amazing medium. Being Canadian, we grew up with a lot of American media.</p>

<p>I think people should be forced to watch tv from other countries sometimes just so they can get a relative idea of reality. American media is hilarious because it&#39;s so insanely unrealistic. Everything is hyper &amp; sensational or just over the top and fake.</p>

<p>With American media in particular, almost everything is trying to either sell you something, or make you think something. It&#39;s not an altruistic medium that is just trying to entertain you, everything is on there for a purpose.</p>

<p>I observe 4 different types of media: local newspaper, national TV, EU level media and US media.</p>

<p>They are all the same. The US media is indeed over the top, but the other media trying to disguise itself as more sensible is just a way to deceive better.</p>

<p>People will just now watch more &quot;sensible&quot; media now but it will be the same kind of brainwashing just under a different disguise.</p>

<p>It&#39;s all controlled opposition.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>“Physiological effects have been observed in a human subject in response to stimulation of the skin with weak electromagnetic fields that are pulsed with certain frequencies near ½ Hz or 2.4 Hz, such as to excite a sensory resonance. Many computer monitors and TV tubes, when displaying pulsed images, emit pulsed electromagnetic fields of sufficient amplitudes to cause such excitation. It is therefore possible to manipulate the nervous system of a subject by pulsing images displayed on a nearby computer monitor or TV set. For the latter, the image pulsing may be imbedded in the program material, or it may be overlaid by modulating a video stream, either as an RF signal or as a video signal. The image displayed on a computer monitor may be pulsed effectively by a simple computer program. For certain monitors, pulsed electromagnetic fields capable of exciting sensory resonances in nearby subjects may be generated even as the displayed images are pulsed with subliminal intensity.”</p>

<p>That is terrifying.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think tv is designed to put people into a hypnotic state so that they can be easily programmed. People are mistaken who believe that tv is all about entertainment and ratings. There are probably psychologists working on the other side to induce this hypnotic state. I notice it especially with commercials, which make up 60% of television anyway. People tend to zone out during commercials making it easier to program people’s unconscious minds. When you watch commercials they all tend to create this certain atmosphere of manufactured culture like everything’s just frickin dandy. Really pisses me off.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Excellent post, 10/10, would conspire again. Every minute spent in front of the TV is completely passive and unproductive, actually destructive in misleading the world as to its own reality. A distraction at best and a weapon at worst. Even shows I like, like The Flash, or Batman Beyond, will still have subversive symbolism, though there are programs like The Simpsons or The Prisoner and Arrested Development that are quality and philosophically it&#39;s difficult to separate television and film because so much of watching TV is movies. And there is public television - Arthur was great, and nature and travel documentaries can be helpful in getting us to become more connected with the world - but to argue that this doesn&#39;t lead to a concentration of power over awareness of anything is folly. It&#39;s pretty scary. What Homer Simpson calls television: &quot;Teacher, mother, secret lover.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree more or less with everything you&#39;ve said here. There are additional factors to it that I believe but it&#39;s a subject I&#39;ve never really been able to put into words and I don&#39;t want to bring it up really until I have it exactly as I want to put it.</p>

<p>That being said I must admit that I too love movies and TV. But I&#39;ve found a sort of compromise that has allowed me to not get as sucked in as I used to be.</p>

<p>First off I have not had broadcast TV or cable in 13 years now. I only watch movies/TV shows on DVD (Well Plex actually, but same theory). The advantage here is that IT ENDS. With TV it just jumps from one to the next to the next and it never stops.</p>

<p>Secondly, I never under any circumstances watch any news program even when I&#39;m at a family members house. I can honestly say I haven&#39;t seen one single news program in the 13 years since I ditched cable.</p>

<p>I am fairly picky with what I will watch, specific TV series and movies and I will pick them up again later and mostly watch a lot of the same thing. I never had a problem with watching/listening to the same thing over and over, I still listen to the same music (more or less) that I was listening to 20 years ago. What this does is while I have the TV on, I am more listening than watching and usually concentrating on work or screwing around with Legos or something else. I hear the TV and know what episode it is and can enjoy it as much as though I was watching it.</p>

<p>Not saying this is a solution other should do, but it has changed my behavior. I used to zombie in and you could call my name 100 times and I wouldn&#39;t hear you until commercial break. Now, no matter how interested in the show I am, I respond immediately. </p>

<p>I know I have more to improve in this area, but it&#39;s a step. Just my 2 cents.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Anyone else have a long spanning aversion to TV (and/or movies)? Not for any one specific reason, but it just hasn&#39;t sat well with you?</p>

<p>I hope there are more than a few of us. I only know one other person who doesn&#39;t enjoy sitting down to watch much of anything, but we will both play video games (probably too often). Otherwise I doubt if I&#39;d even own a TV, and most of the time it sits unused as my monitor has better quality.</p>

<p>Until a few years ago, when I was first discovering Brave New World, I hadn&#39;t offered much thought about why I didn&#39;t seem to have similar interests as most of the people I know or have known. A few more dystopian themed books down the line I stumbled onto 1984, Fahrenheit 451, and &quot;Flow My tears, the Policeman Said.&quot; Whatever shred of hope I had for being able blend in and maybe even finally enjoy TV and movies was dashed, but I&#39;m no longer upset at the idea that I probably won&#39;t blend into the crowd very well ever. Not if that is how its going to be, anyway.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The news started being accompanied by music quite some time ago which is meant to blend the line between reality and drama.  The movies and TV shows have always used music to convey emotion, which the music accompanying news presentations is meant to do also, but the main goal is to make reality seem like another TV show.  That way people more easily accept being manipulated in ways that are harmful to their real lives.  Furthermore, TV shows are obnoxious and written by people with no real wit or talent, but the live audience laughs on cue, and the TV viewer is, like you said, Pavlov&#39;s dog, and laughs when triggered along with the laughter coming from the TV even though it&#39;s not really funny.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Nah, television is a net good, by far. If there were no television then we&#39;d have millions of people who don&#39;t know how to speak intelligibly or understand that the world outside of their neighborhood exists. Be real, if people weren&#39;t watching tv, they wouldn&#39;t be sitting around reading fine literature and sipping tea. You&#39;d have feral children who were shut up in the house all day by helicopter parents with no stimulation. Television doesn&#39;t promote the greatest social norms, but its far better than what many kids would be taught by default by their broken, dysfunctional, socially isolated families there are so many of these days.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I used to have my TV on quite a lot when I lived with my parents, just to have some background noise. I moved out now, I have a TV for my consoles, for Netflix and YouTube. I refuse to watch TV programs unless it is something of my choice (on Netflix) and it doesn&#39;t include all those annoying commercials. I noticed I have so much time out of the sudden to do more interesting stuff. I want to watch 4 movies in one evening? Sure, no problem. I want to work on my writing? Yeah, with no distraction. I can just go for a trip, drive somewhere, go out with my friends without being chained onto TV &quot;because I really need to watch that episode of smelly garbage at eight PM&quot;.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I wanted to comment earlier but other stuff got in the way.</p>

<p>I agree with this post 100%.  My mother had multiple health problems and became almost immobile because of TV!  She watches at least 10 hours a day of TV.  I can&#39;t even stand thinking about the TV and I where headphones to drown the insidious bullshit out when I visit her.</p>

<p>The screeching from the hideous females on this media make The Medusa and The Harpies models of female attractiveness by comparison.</p>

<p>Day time TV is the worst.  Think about it?!  Who would pay Steve Harvey, Dr Phil, Oprah billions for what they do which is essentially useless time wasting crap.  The motive is to passivey the masses so they eat their mac and cheese drooling in the front of the boob tube. </p>

<p>The worst is Maury &#39;YOU ARE THE FATHER&#39; Povich.  My GOD can a man get any more repulsive!?  A grimaced rotting corpse is more palatable. </p>

<p>American media is really insidious I could not watch it, in Europe the reporters are a little bit more restrained, but it&#39;s essentially the same BS just under a different cover.</p>

<p>American female anchors are very ugly have harsh masculine voices, wear tons of makeup, and always scream and behave like clowns, I could not take anything there seriously. It&#39;s a parody of themselves, I can&#39;t understand how can any decent person watch that crap.</p>

<p>Besides it looks so fake to me, they are all acting there and behaving so superficially, it&#39;s so fake all of it.</p>

<p>I am only subscribed to a local newspaper, that is the only mainstream media that I consume regularly, and yes they lie a lot too,but it keeps me up to date with local events which I find more important than this global geopolitical BS.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Exactly - The local media is OK but local politics here in the US (DC Area) is still dumber than DOG SH*T. They build $50 million dollar school buildings and can&#39;t give teachers a raise?!!  Then they want to change school names - Washington &amp; Lee High School to some BS name that will cost 10 of thousands of dollars at least to implement this BS name change while people are on the street.  IDIOTS!!</p>

<p>The local PTB always cave into the money developers!  It&#39;s disgusting. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well yes sometimes people just have to let the steam off, but you can do that other ways too.</p>

<p>However people take that to the extreme and just constantly watch TV even when they don&#39;t even want to or need to. It has just became an addictive habit like smoking.</p>
