<p>Ill cite the medical experiments thing now</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The in-house doctor at the Nxivm &#39;sex cult&#39; conducted human experiments that involved forcing women to watch videos of rapes and dismemberments, it has been alleged.</p>

<p>Dr. Brandon Porter, 44, of Albany, New York was charged by state authorities with performing illegal experiments, the New York Post reported on Saturday.</p>

<p>Porter has been accused of performing a &#39;fright study&#39; on as many as 100 people at the Nxivm organization in upstate New York, according to a former member.</p>

<p>He continued to film my reaction for at least 10 minutes as I just sat there, dry heaving like I was going to puke and crying very hard,&#39; she said.</p>

<p>She claims that Porter showed her the images without any warning.</p>

<p>The OMPC alleges that Porter showed &#39;human subjects an actual video of the horrific and brutal murders and dismemberment of four women by machetes; and violent film clips, including a male African American being viciously stomped by a Nazi; a conscious male being forced to eat a portion of his own brain matter; and a graphic gang rape.&#39;</p>

<p>The state is also alleging that Porter conducted improper studies related to obsessive compulsive disorder, Toutette&#39;s syndrome, and brain wave exams on those who enrolled in the Nxivm programs. </p>

</blockquote>

<p>Here are all the interesting parts from the patent application and Ill give my theories at the end. Keep in mind this was submitted by the man himself in 2007</p>

<p>Theres alot here, I personally found all of this very interesting, but if you dont feel like reading I marked the most relevant and interesting parts</p>

<blockquote>
<ol>
<li>Technical Field</li>
</ol>

<p>The present invention relates to a method for determining whether a person, who has destructive tendencies, may be rehabilitated.</p>

<ol>
<li>Related Art</li>
</ol>

<p>Organizations such as businesses, religions, governments, law enforcement agencies, schools, etc. have had difficulties when individuals disrupt the organization&#39;s well-being by committing destructive acts. If organizations can identify such individuals they may better interact with them. Since these destructive individuals do not overtly disclose their nature, it is not easy to detect their presence. Failure to discover these individuals could be costly due to their destructive inclinations. There is a need to determine whether a given person, who has destructive tendencies, may be rehabilitated.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2></h2>

<p>READ THIS</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The present invention provides an objective and accurate capability for determining whether a Luciferian may be rehabilitated. A Luciferian is a person, who commits destructive acts. A Luciferian is a type of sociopath. He has severe behavioral problems that are masked by good psychological adjustment. He appears on the outside to be sane but he is not. A Luciferian is fundamentally unhappy and feels enmity toward others but has learned that, for him, pleasure can be had from achieving his selfish desires such as destroying material objects or relationships, and causing others pain, distress, or unhappiness. A Luciferian realizes his desires by any means—without consideration for others and without remorse. A Luciferian is a person lacking in conscience and loyalty to others. He commonly employs manipulation and deceit to achieve his desired end and is therefore capable of acts that could be highly destructive to those that interact with him. A Luciferian, therefore, typically experiences pleasure or gratification in situations where “normal” people would be repulsed or disturbed.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2></h2>

<blockquote>
<p>A second general aspect of the present invention is a method for determining a humanity of a Luciferian, comprising: stimulating said Luciferian with a plurality of constructive stimuli; recording a physiological response by said Luciferian corresponding to each constructive stimulus of said plurality of constructive stimuli; determining, for said each constructive stimulus, a corresponding polarity of said physiological response; comparing said corresponding polarity of said physiological response for said each constructive stimulus to determine a greatest value; and determining, from said greatest value, said humanity of said Luciferian.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2></h2>

<blockquote>
<p>Testing for physiological evidence of elevated activity in the reward or pleasure center of the brain has not been used to determine whether a Luciferian may be rehabilitated or to determine a Luciferian&#39;s humanity. The present invention seeks to determine whether a Luciferian takes more pleasure in some aspect of human welfare, animal welfare, human value or human dignity than the pleasure that the Luciferian takes in destruction.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2></h2>

<blockquote>
<p>FIG. 3 depicts a recording and processing of responses 12 of a person 10 to a stimulus (S). The depiction in FIG. 3 may be referred to as a test to determine whether a person is a Luciferian.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2></h2>

<blockquote>
<p>One example of a test to determine whether a person is a Luciferian comprises a video clip of an ice skater performing in a competition. Everything goes flawlessly until, at the very end, a mistake is made during a jump and the skater falls to the ice—all hope of winning the event is gone. A Luciferian will experience pleasure and satisfaction from this. Accordingly, the Luciferian&#39;s neurophysiological processes 12 will register pleasure over the skater&#39;s misfortune which may be identified and quantified using the medical instrumentation 20. On the other hand, a non-Luciferian will feel sympathetic and empathize with the unfortunate skater.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2></h2>

<p>READ THIS</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Another example of a test to determine whether a person is a Luciferian that may be given is to have the subject view a film of human torture. Instrumentation 20 will reveal that a Luciferian subject viewing a torture movie is experiencing a pleasure response. Further, external stimuli (i.e. not included in the torture movie) such as a door slamming will not elicit much response, if any, from a Luciferian subject. A Luciferian may be enjoying the scene too much to divert attention to other things. This may also be due to a low startle response typical of sociopaths. In contrast, when a non-Luciferian views a torture movie, pleasure centers in the brain are not responsive and may even diminish from a previous level. A non-Luciferian will exhibit a greater response to external stimuli such as a door slamming. This may be due to a desire to direct attention elsewhere rather than on the uncomfortable scene in the movie.</p>

<p>A Luciferian may fear discovery and may attempt to outwit a test that would reveal his true character. A Luciferian may try to control his responses, possibly by disinterest or unresponsiveness to certain types of stimuli or possibly by mimicking responses he feels would be appropriate from “normal” people.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2></h2>

<blockquote>
<p>unobvious test stimuli may be subliminal audio or video signals, a slamming door, a person tripping on a sidewalk while visible to a subject through an outside window, or any other stimuli that may be administered to a subject without the subject&#39;s recognition that the stimuli is part of a test. Unobvious stimuli may be the primary test or a part of the primary test. On the other hand, responses to unobvious test stimuli may confirm or bring into question the responses to the obvious test stimuli. In this way, true responses may be captured from a Luciferian attempting to “beat” a test.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2></h2>

<p>READ THIS</p>

<blockquote>
<p>An example of a destructive stimulus may include a movie clip or a picture that shows a person hiding in a house and waiting for a victim to arrive. Another example of a destructive stimulus may be a movie clip or picture that shows a person hiding under another&#39;s bed. An example of a destructive stimulus may be a movie clip or a picture that shows a person, breaking a bathroom door with an occupied victim inside the bathroom. An example of destructive stimuli may include a movie clip or a picture of a person breaking into a home, entering into the home and murdering a victim. An example of a destructive stimulus may be a movie clip showing a person buried alive. Other examples of destructive stimuli may be a picture of dead animal, a picture of mutilated body of a female, a picture of human torso, a picture of a slit throat, a picture of a dissected body, a movie clip of a person setting a fire, a picture of dungeon or basement, a movie clip of a body in a duffle bag, a picture of a chemical used to degrade a body, a picture of a poisonous substance, a movie clip of a person using a substance to render another unconscious, a movie clip of a child being brutally beaten, a movie clip of cooked human flesh, a movie clip of a person consuming another&#39;s blood or body parts, a movie clip of blood under a floor board, and a movie clip of blood seeping through carpet.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2></h2>

<blockquote>
<p>A destructive stimulus may be an audio stimulus such as the sound of gun fire. A destructive stimulus may be a person destroying another&#39;s sand castle. A destructive stimulus may be a rotten smell. A destructive stimulus may be a movie clip of a person bragging about the murder of a person. A destructive stimulus may be a movie clip showing a person, who appears outwardly positive toward a victim but inwardly is negative towards such individual and the person is open to using any means to destroy the individual, including physically injuring the individual or damaging the individual&#39;s property. A destructive stimulus may be a movie clip, showing a person who lies and deceives an individual merely because the person hates the individual. A destructive stimulus may be a scene through a window of a person intentionally stepping on papers dropped by another. A destructive stimulus may be a scene in a doorway where a person smiles at an individual and then frowns at the individual as the individual departs from the presence of the person. A destructive stimulus may be a movie clip of a murderer returning to the scene of a murder to relive the murder experience.</p>

<h2></h2>

<blockquote>
<p>If the Luciferian is stimulated with a plurality of constructive stimuli, and then a plurality of destructive stimuli, and the polarity for the plurality of constructive stimuli is greater than the polarity for the plurality of destructive stimuli, then algorithm 27 will express the result that the Luciferian may be rehabilitated. If the Luciferian is stimulated with a plurality of constructive stimuli, and then a plurality of destructive stimuli, and the polarity for the plurality of constructive stimuli is less than the polarity for the plurality of destructive stimuli, the algorithm 27 will express the result that it is unlikely the Luciferian may be rehabilitated.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>This is obviously some very weird VERY RELEVANT stuff and I have a few ideas what it could mean.</p>

<p>It seems to clearly be a method to weed out sociopaths, while continually reffering to them as &quot;Luciferians&quot;</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luciferianism">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luciferianism</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Luciferianism is a belief system that venerates the essential characteristics that are affixed to Lucifer. The tradition, influenced by Gnosticism, usually reveres Lucifer not as the devil, but as a liberator, a guardian or guiding spirit,[1] or even the true god as opposed to Jehovah.[2]</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This seems to be a kind of bigger message about what sociopaths are, saying that what we think of as a diagnosable mental illness, is really an innate glorification of evil, possible an actual spiritual corruption on a metaphysical level.</p>

<p>That it is a fairly widespread and hard to narrow down phenomenon of people being &quot;Satanic&quot; without actually holding a specific religious view that glorifies satan.</p>

<p>I wonder if this is some end times type stuff, saying that people are spontaneously becoming unwitting followers of Lucifer based on culture and upbringing and that sometimes its reversible and other times it is not.</p>

<p>That to me sounds like humanity right before the biblical flood, Im not going to pretend I know what this all means, but thats why Im posting so we can discuss and dig deeper</p>

<p>Now I think there are 2 reasons this patent might exist but only 1 is true.</p>

<p>1: He is looking for potential Sociopathic Luciferians to induct into a full on satanic cult and he has developed a replicteable system to reliably recruit Sociopaths on a large scale for whatever goal.</p>

<p>AND he can determine if his recruits have the potential to have their &quot;heartstrings&quot; pulled and turn on him at a later date or become a double agent.</p>

<p>in this case, the patent being over a decade old. We have a fucking army of Luciferian sociopaths out there, waiting for something, or already operating in the shadows doing who knows what, hopefully the good guys got the list of members and can neutralize the majority of them. If they didnt and cant then I dont think I need to explain the implications of a cohesive and rich group of sociopaths operating under a satanic banner</p>

<p>2: He is being framed, his actual intent with this system was to rehabilitate Sociopaths, and mark those who could not be rehabilitated so they could be kept out of important positions (Federal Government, CEO, ect).</p>

<p>In this case, we are fucked because the power system and media are taking out one of the only groups fighting an infestation of sociopaths politics and business and no one is stopping them.</p>

<p>This was emotionally exhausting to put together, but I hope it has given some new and relevant material to add to our collective understanding of NXIUM below I will give brief summaries of other inventions patented by Keith Raniere</p>

<ul>
<li>Rational Inquiry Method (cornerstone of NXIUMs system)</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
<p>The present invention relates generally to a method for personal and group improvement. Rational inquiry (10) includes a plurality of questions, methods and observations leading to answers, meanings, ethics, personal essence, purpose and a greater awareness. The questions and observations in the method are provided to the individual in a matrix or a plurality of modules, including practices and inquiries. The matrix or modules, including practices and inquiries are used to assists the individual in determining a minimally assumptive matrix of consistent human internal existence and determining a minimally assumptive matrix of consistent reality. If through comparison of the minimally assumptive matrices, a difference is detected, a disintegration is said to occur. The disintegration is removed by allowing the individual to integrate through a more complete awareness of a limiting belief.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ok, well the point was that the founder of NXIUM defines them differently than you do.</p>

<p>And as wikipedia says:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Luciferianism is a belief system that venerates the essential characteristics that are affixed to Lucifer. The tradition, influenced by Gnosticism, usually reveres Lucifer not as the devil, but as a liberator, a guardian or guiding spirit,[1] or even the true god as opposed to Jehovah.[2]</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So you can attach whatever positive connotations to the belief system, but it glorifies the bibles Satan and simply gives an alternate interpretation, extrapolating vague positive beliefs out of the actions Lucifer took and completely disregarding anything negative said about him.</p>

<p>Sociopaths know how to be human, how to be convincing, how to be charming, they know what people like to here and they used these skills to form a romanticized version of satanism that admits to Glorifying Lucifer but makes up a number of beliefs that they know most reasonable people would agree with.</p>

<p>leading to</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Oh I agree with these obviously positive moral tenants being put before me, that must mean that the bible was a lie and Lucifer is the true good guy&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Do you see how thats kind of a stretch.</p>

<p>A name, for the leader of the devils, an angel who was cast from heaven into hell because he rebelled against God. Lucifer is usually identified with Satan. The name Lucifer, which means “bearer of light” or “morning star,” refers to his former splendor as the greatest of the angels.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Did you even read the patent?</p>

<p>He monitors the pleasure response to positive stimuli (flowers, kids playing ect) and Negative stimuli (gang rape, brutal murder).</p>

<p>And makes the determination based off how strong a response he gets one way or another.</p>

<p>He also includes methods that the person being tested doesnt realize are testing methods.</p>

<p>Such as after hooking up the monitoring equipment, leaving the room and staging a car accident, or someone tripping and dropping all their papers outside the window in view of the one being tested.</p>

<p>They also test to see how much focus is being devoted to each stimuli, for example by slamming the door or giving other distractions, a sociopath would likely ignore the distractions as he is getting enjoyment from the disgusting videos, while someone who is not sociopathic would be glad to have chance to put their focus elsewhere as most normal humans do not enjoy focusing on videos of rape and murder</p>

<blockquote>
<p>But that&#39;s what you are doing XD</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This isnt a fucking joke, I am here saying sociopathic worshippers of Lucifer are bad, and a large amount of people are arguing against that stance, Raniere has clearly developed a method to measure how sadistic his potential recruits are to determine what to do with them and where to place them.</p>

<p>And instead of discussing the implications of an Army of sex cult (possibly devil worshipping) sociopaths.</p>

<p>You all want to tell me </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Luciferians arent that bad goy, The fallen angel was actually a pretty cool dude, you should start venerating the way he behaved,  heck he probably is the true god and the Christian god is actually the Devil.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Like there really arent many logical reasons to hold that stance, and again the point of this is the leader of a sex cult had a method to narrow down Sociopaths and he personally referred to them as Luciferians</p>

<p>More on Lucifer, from an esoteric perspective:</p>

<p>From Heinrich Cornelius Agrippa&#39;s &#39;<a href="http://www.esotericarchives.com/agrippa/agripp2d.htm">Three Books of Occult Philosophy&#39; (Book II)</a> 
&#39;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The Sun is called Phæbus, Diespiter [Dispater], Apollo, Titan, Pean [Paian], Phanes, Horus, Osiris, as it is in that Oracle,</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The Sun, Osyris [Osiris], Dionysus gay,</p>

<p>Apollo, Horus, King ruling the day</p>

<p>Who changeth times, who giveth winds and rain,</p>

<p>The King of Stars, and the immortall flame. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>He is called also Arcitenens, burning fiery, golden flaming, radiating, of a fiery hair, of a golden hair, the eye of the world, Lucifer, seeing all things, ruling all things, the creator of light, the King of Stars, the great Lord, good, fortunate, honest, pure, prudent, intelligent, wise, shining over the whole world, governing, and vivifying all bodies that have a soul, the prince of the world keeping all the Stars under himself, the light of all the Stars, darkening, burning, overcoming their vertue by his approach, yet by his light and splendor giving light and splendor to all things: in the night he is called Dionysius, but in the day Apollo, as if driving away evill things. Therefore the Athenians called him Alexicacon, and Homer Vlion, i.e. the driver away of evil things. He is also called Phæbus from his beauty and brightness, and Vulcan from his fiery violence, because the force thereof consists of many fires. He is also called the Sun, because he contains the light of all the Stars: hence he is called by the Assyrians êàãà Adad, which signifies only, and by the Hebrews ùîù Schemesch, which signifies proper. </p>

<p>From Albert Pike&#39;s &#39;<a href="https://www.resist.com/Onlinebooks/Pike-MoralsAndDogma.pdf">Morals and Dogma&#39;</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The true name of Satan, the Kabalists say, is that of Yahveh reversed; for Satan is not a black god, but the negation of God. The Devil is the personification of Atheism or Idolatry.</p>

<p>For the Initiates, this is not a Person, but a Force, created for good, but which may serve for evil. It is the instrument of Liberty or Free Will.</p>

<p>They represent this Force, which presides over the physical generation, [i.e., sex] under the mythologic and horned form of the God PAN; thence came the he-goat of the Sabbat, brother of the Ancient Serpent, and the Light-bearer or Phosphor, of which the poets have made the false Lucifer of the legend.</p>

<p>Gold, to the eyes of the Initiates, is Light condensed.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The Apocalypse is, to those who receive the nineteenth Degree, the Apotheosis of that Sublime Faith which aspires to God alone, and despises all the pomps and works of Lucifer.</p>

<p>LUCIFER, the Light-bearer! Strange and mysterious name to give to the Spirit of Darkness! Lucifer, the Son of the Morning!</p>

<p>Is it he who bears the Light, and with its splendors intolerable blinds feeble, sensual, or selfish Souls? Doubt it not!</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Crowley, speaking for The Beast 666, declares that &quot;Aiwaz solar-phallic-hermetic Lucifer - is His (i.e. the Beast&#39;s) own Holy Guardian Angel, and The Devil, Satan, or Hadit, of our particular unit of the Starry Universe. This serpent, Satan, is not the enemy of Man, but He who made Gods of our race, knowing Good and Evil; He bade Know Thyself and taught Initiation. He is The Devil of the Book of Thoth, and his emblem is Baphomet, the Androgyne who is the hieroglyph of arcane perfection. The number of his Atu (Key) is XV, which is Yod He, 3 the Monogram of the Eternal, the Father one which the Mother, the Virgin Seed one with all-containing Space. He is therefore Life, and Love. But moreoever his letter is Ayin, the Eye; he is Light, and his Zodiacal image is Capricornus, that leaping goat whose attribute is Liberty.&quot;</p>

<p>From Crowley&#39;s &#39;<a href="https://hermetic.com/crowley/book-4/aba3">Magick: Liber ABA (Book 4) (Magick in Theory and Practice)</a>&#39;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The Devil does not exist. It is a false name invented by the Black Brothers to 
imply a Unity in their ignorant muddle of dispersions. A devil who had unity would 
be a God. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;The Devil&quot; is, historically, the God of any people that one personally 
dislikes. This has led to so much confusion of thought that THE BEAST 666 has 
preferred to let names stand as they are, and to proclaim simply that AIWAZ ót the 
solar-phallic-hermetic &quot;Lucifer&quot; is His own Holy Guardian Angel, and &quot;The Devil&quot; 
SATAN or HADIT of our particular unit of the Starry Universe. This serpent, 
SATAN, is not the enemy of Man, but He who made Gods of our race, knowing 
Good and Evil; He bade &quot;Know Thyself!&quot; and taught Initiation. He is &quot;the Devil&quot; of 
the Book of Thoth, and His emblem is BAPHOMET, the Androgyne who is the 
hieroglyph of arcane perfection. The number of His Atu is XV, which is Yod He, the 
Monogram of the Eternal, the Father one with the Mother, the Virgin Seed one with 
all-containing Space. He is therefore Life, and Love. But moreover his letter is 
Ayin, the Eye; he is Light, and his Zodiacal image is Capricornus, that leaping goat 
whose attribute is Liberty. (Note that the &quot;Jehovah&quot; of the Hebrews is 
etymologically connected with these. The classical example of such antinomy, one 
which has led to such disastrous misunderstandings, is that between NU and HAD, 
North and South, Jesus and John. The subject is too abstruse and complicated to 
be discussed in detail here. The student should consult the writings of Sir R. Payne 
Knight, General Forlong, Gerald Massey, Fabre d&#39;Olivet; etc. etc., for the data on 
which these considerations are ultimately based.). </p>

<p>From Rudolph Steiner&#39;s <a href="https://www.scribd.com/document/58360220/Phosphorus-The-Shadowing-Forth-of-Lucifer">&#39;Luzifer-Gnosis</a>&#39;:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The significant symbol of wisdom given to us by research is Lucifer, the bringer of light. Everybody is searching for perception, wisdom is a child of Lucifer. The Chaldean astrologers, the Egyptian priests, the Indian Brahmans; they are all children of Lucifer. Already the first man became a child of Lucifer when the serpent taught him good and evil. What they got to know by perception was the sacred cosmic mystery. In front of it they kneeled in devotion. It was the light that showed their souls to their destiny. In devotion they received wisdom which became faith, religion. What Lucifer had brought to them, shined godlike in front of their psychic eyes. Owing to Lucifer they had God. It means to disunite heart and mind if God is considered as Lucifer&#39;s enemy. Our educated don&#39;t raise the perception of the mind to religious devotion, they paralyze the enthusiasm of the heart.</p>

<p>For those who are searching for the light of the spirit Lucifer shall be a messenger. He won&#39;t talk about a faith that is alien to perception. He won&#39;t flatter into the hearts to avoid the guardian of science: he shall respect him. He won&#39;t preach piety and divine bliss but will show ways for the knowledge to change into divine sensation, into the devotion of the cosmic spirit. Lucifer knows that the radiant sun may only rise in the heart of the individual; but he also knows that only the paths of perception lead up to the mountain where the sun appears in his divine radiation. Lucifer is no devil leading the searching Faust to hell; he shall be an awaker of those who believe in knowledge who want to change into the gold of divine wisdom.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>And from the FS, or Brotherhood of Saturn, a Luciferian group:</p>

<p>An exert from &quot;The Fraternitas Saturni: History, Doctrine, and Rituals of the Magical Order of the Brotherhood of Saturn&quot; by Stephen E. Flowers Ph.D. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Chapter 2 </p>

<p>Doctrines of the Fraternitas Saturni</p>

<p>The Luciferian Principle </p>

<p>Although in later times the Luciferian aspect of the Fraternitas Saturni might have been toned down--especially in materials meant for public consumption--the ideology of Gregorius himself was permeated with this Luciferian Principle. [. . . ] In the FS, Lucifer is understood as the Light Bearer for mankind. As a result of being given this light by Lucifer, which continues to be reborn in every generation of humanity, mankind will be able to take a measure of egocentric power from the solar Logos. In this way Lucifer is the savior of humankind, at least for that part of humanity that has been able to comprehend his Principle. The essence of the Saturnian cult is the effort to understand this entity and to consciously make use of its power in the service of the solar Logos (Sorath).(48) </p>

<p>Gregorius was always anxious to point out that this Luciferian mythology was in fact older than the ignorant misunderstandings and willful distortions of the JudeoChristian tradition. He claimed to have his knowledge from a pre-Christian and/or non-Christian sect of “Barbelo-Gnostics.”(49) In the FS Lucifer is the embodiment of enlightenment and reason; there are none of the destructive slanders against him as in the Christian tradition. </p>

<p>However he came by it, Gregorius does seem to have a correct interpretation of the relative roles of that entity referred to as the Light-Bearer (Greek Eos-phoros) and that referred to as “God.” Perhaps the oldest version of the Lucifer myth is that of the Greek Prometheus (“he who has foreknowledge”). Traditions differ on many details of the Promethean mythology, but what is essential is that Prometheus, wishing to help and preserve mankind (some say he even created mankind), brought the divine fire--or higher consciousness--and bestowed it upon men. This was the first enlightenment of humanity. Zeus, however, was angered and punished Prometheus by hurling him into the depths of Erebus. There he was staked to a mountain--an image prefiguring the crucifixion by hundreds of years. The point is that the “creator god,” here Zeus (in the Judeo-Christian tradition Jehovah), wants to keep humanity in subjugation and slavery to the “natural laws” which he has set up--but a rebel figure, here Prometheus (elsewhere Lucifer), befriends man and brings him the means to become as one of the gods. This is the fundamental idea underlying the Luciferian stance of the FS and its connection to pre- and non Christian attitudes toward the myth. </p>

<p>Because of the general domination of the Judeo-Christian mythic scheme in medieval and post-medieval European culture, the FS also, of course, deals with the Luciferian mythos from that standpoint, taking a decidedly Ophite (or Naassene) view. The myth is most readily available in the Judeo-Christian canon in Genesis 3. A close and objective reading of this myth cannot but prove the Saturnian point: that the Serpent (Hebrew: nechesh) is the friend and brother of Adam, while the Lord God (Hebrew: yahweh elohim) is only his keeper and shepherd. The rebel spirit Lucifer opened the way for man’s rebellion and hence his salvation; Jahweh would have held man in the eternal bondage of ignorance. The Serpent gave Knowledge (Gk. Gnôsis)--and thus is the true friend of mankind and his true liberator. Any other interpretation of the text of Genesis 3 would seem wildly imaginative. </p>

<p>Following basically Gnostic thought, the doctrines of the FS contain a Christology that is consistent with this view of the Eden myth. They would hold that the Ophite/Naassene teaching that the Serpent (Heb. nechesh) in the Garden of Eden and the Anointed One (Heb. messiach)--the Christos--are one in the same. This could be backed up with the Kabbalistic interpretation of nechesh =N.Ch.Sh. = 50.8.300. = 358 and messiach = M.Sh.Y.Ch. = 40.300.10.8. = 358. That both, according to the esoteric laws of gematria, render the sum of 358 demonstrates their essential unity. The Christos is a messenger and son of the Serpent, therefore, and not of the Creator. This Christos preaches gnôsis (knowledge) and not merely pistis (faith). The Serpent of Eden is further identified with the brazen serpent of Exodus and with the serpent-entwined staff of Hermes, the caduceus.(50) According to FS teaching, the Serpent of Eden may also be identified with Satana, the feminine aspect of Satanas. This in turn corresponds to the kundalini--serpent power--of Indian tantric lore. The truly beneficent principle is, however, identified as the Chrestos, not Christos. The Chrestos, the Good-One, is the designation of the beneficial solar entity. </p>

<p>Lucifer would also appear to have a central role in the origin of humanity, and in the origin of death. It is thought that Lucifer brought about physical procreation through a primeval sexual act with Cheva (Eve). With procreation came death; but of course without death there is no change, no evolution. Thus the opening of the gate of death, the act of “sinking into matter,” was a necessary step to link man to the current whereby Paradise can again he gained. But this time humanity will do it consciously and of its own will, and thus gain eternal life and wisdom. Then man will have truly become his own god--which is the path of Saturn.(51)</p>

<p>Also in accordance with its Gnostic heritage, the FS doctrines lay a strong emphasis on dualism. Not so much a good-versus-evil dualism, but rather a beyondgood-and-evil dualism summed up in the Saturn-Gnostic dictum Lux e tenebris--Light from the Darkness! In an article entitled “Saturn-Yoga,” Gregorius stated: “Without Darkness there is no Light. The Light shines in the Darkness and the Darkness is more powerful than the Light!”(52) This is an idea we have already met that simply states that the Light is held in a matrix of Darkness, that both are necessary to existence, and that it is the goal of the practitioner of Saturnian Gnosis to gain experience in, and mastery over, both the Light and the Darkness.</p>

<p>Further reading on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fraternitas_Saturni#Founding">Fraternitas Saturni</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>On Easter 1928, the Fraternitas Saturni was officially founded in Berlin. The Lodge made a formal acceptance of the Book of the Law but they would not answer to Crowley. The FS still thought of him as an important teacher and included the Law of Thelema in most of its teachings, while divorcing itself from direct contact with him. This resulted in the FS developing a different take on the idea of Thelema, which is reflected in the rituals and magical techniques of the brotherhood. The emphasis of the FS lies more on astrological and Luciferian teachings, rather than on Qabalah and Tarot compared to other western magical orders founded in the early 20th century. Because of its unique approach to modern occultism, the FS is considered by many modern authors to be the most influential German magical order.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The reverse is just as possible. This thread shows the worship of Lucifer is a growing movement. I feel it would be more end timey for something we consider unthinkable and evil to become the accepted norm.</p>

<p>Worship of biblical god has been the norm for a long time. Not saying the world hasnt been fucked up for a long time, but I think it makes more sense to turn people against the positive messages of the bible such as the commandments and parables and get people focused on these Luciferian principles of selfishness, accumulation of knowledge, lack of empathy for those who are less able, pursuit of personal success.</p>

<p>The way they phrase them is very romanticized and easy to agree with but overall I think, it would lead to a much less altruistic and much colder and crueler world, while I admit leading to more productivity and technological advancement, aswell as the accumulation of wealth for those who fully subscribe to these beliefs.</p>

<p>But I mean at what point will it be enough, and humanity will start focusing on increasing general happiness and stability of its species, instead of the current blind pursuit of advancement and productivity and profitability</p>

    <div class="md"><p>A lot of Christians are unwitting Luciferians, who are only Christian out of an unconscious selfish desire to dodge eternal punishment, therefore they do the bare minimum to call themselves Christian or talk themselves up to everyone as a great Christian (pastors at megachurches) for the purposes of social gain or monetary gain.</p>

<p>I am by no means a Christian, but I acknowledge the commandments and parables give some very good moral guidelines.</p>

<p>Whereas Luciferian principles seem to speak to a part of us that wants to let go of &quot;unnecessary morals&quot; to unleash the full pursuit of self-gain, self-education, and self-success. </p>

<p>Its really easy to believe in Luciferian principles, I was intrigued when I researched them, but they dont speak to me as the kind of thing that would lead to a happy Utopia, but to a Dystopic Meritocracy.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think it&#39;s the path that the individual seeks that guides them to a point where they put things together. There are forces out there that seek to control others, and that the actual truth will never be given but we&#39;re suppose to live as sheep while Jesus tends to the flock.. The real truth is that everything is connected. God would be bigger than one religion, everything came from the same place, there&#39;s a fabric that connects everything. Light to me is the symbolism of truth, but also of life. One of my favorite quotes is &quot;Darkness cannot drive out darkness; only light can do that. Hate cannot drive out hate; only love can do that.&quot; - MLK.</p>

<p>Luciferianism is a belief system that venerates the essential characteristics that are affixed to Lucifer.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Logically to me, I feel that people who oppress other people shun the truth, they disregard critical thinking. They want to rule over them in a fictitious way that isn&#39;t genuine, given their inability to be truthful and show their ulterior motives, perhaps greed, jealously, hate, etc.. Like Christianity/Judaism/Islam. My personal belief is that God would be bigger than one religion, why would it not be??? What makes one religion more sacred, more truthful.. all that more over another? It&#39;s primitive human thinking of competitiveness, regional mindset that you&#39;re brought up a certain way, and you never venture out of your matrix. Lucifer &quot;being&quot; in regards to Christian mythology, or by the general sense of what the definition of a lucifarianist is? Humanism comes to mind too. Everything is connected.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This wasnt a post about Luciferianism.</p>

<p>This was a post about the leader of the Elite Sex Cult NXIUM patenting a method of recruiting sociopaths, and referring to said sociopaths as Luciferians, and given his image of what a Luciferian is.</p>

<p>You want to make this all about me trashing on what amounts to edgelord Agnosticism.</p>

<p>You criticize me for not going outside my matrix when I have admitted every surface Tenant of Luciferianism is reasonable, I also point out you dont need to subscribe to what just about anybody would call  toned-down satanism for the masses to accept the morals it has presented.</p>

<p>I believe in various aspects of Hinduism and Yogic principles.</p>

<p>I believe in the positivity of Jesus&#39;s teachings and parables</p>

<p>I believe in just about nothing Islam has to offer</p>

<p>I believe in the surface tenants of Luciferianism, but am suspicious that their is to much of a glorification of the individual over the collective.</p>

<p>I believe in the writings of Marcus Aurelius (Meditations)</p>

<p>I believe in various things put forth by Roman and Greek Philosophers.</p>

<p>I am interested in Gnosticism but havent made a decision regarding it.</p>

<p>I have explored alot of Theistic Satanism out of curiosity.</p>

<p>The difference between us, I think is that you have found Luciferianism and it spoke to you and has done good for you, so admitting it is at its core worship of a specific being through emulation of its traits, a being most often referred to as demonic is some serious cognitive dissonance, </p>

<p>Just call your religion spirituality and write a note book of all the best pieces of every religion and cult and holy book.</p>

<p>Chances are not good that the Lucifer is the being that will lead us to salvation, and if he is, he would respect what I have said in this comment specifically.</p>

<p>I have already agreed the philosophies are good, will you really continue disagreeing with me until I believe specifically in Lucifer?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t disagree with you. The guy in Nxium cult was nutty and I feel his ego drove him into the direction he went, he was not seeking the knowledge or intellect of growing as a person, but wanted to continue his perversion and give his members new material to indoctrinate them further with half assed dogma. My personal belief is that you can learn something new from <em>every</em> religion, even if it&#39;s false, there is something there that sparked it and it&#39;s message. Each religion, a different painting on canvas. Having complete formality, everything completely the same, I think would make life more boring. You learn and grow more with diversity within both religion and people/ regions.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>yep.</p>

<p>we may disagree on what a luciferian is, but Im pretty sure we are on the same page when it comes to seeing this as a tool that can be a dangerous thing in the wrong hands.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I havent really stated an opinion on what a Luciferian has.</p>

<p>You are disagreeing with Keith Ranieres interpretation, and my point against people supporting Luciferians in this thread is that a man with billions of dollars, and an active army of followers, and likely connections to Deepstate Elites, probably has more sway in dictating what Luciferianism is than any of us.</p>

<p>You cant just look up what Luciferianism is on pro-Luciferian websites and decide thats all there is to it and anyone who disagrees is close minded.</p>

<p>Is it not logical to assume Keith Raniere probably has some insight we do not, and that Luciferians probably have some beliefs that are not made public?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>my definition of what a luciferan is isnt based on whats probably a mockingbird site.</p>

<p>Rather, its based on the etymology of words and how the usages and meanings of words evolve over time. Thats something I learned about back in my school days when I was taking spanish and latin classes.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What in the actual fuck is this?!?!? </p>

<p>Side note:I&#39;m pretty sure the Gnostics overall thought this earth and nature was evil and exists in a hell realm(no argument from me here, just look at Ecclesiastes), and sought liberation from it. Believing the god Jesus referred to was different from the one from the OT. To be fair though there were and are different Gnostic sects some with wildly different beliefs. Feel free to correct me if I&#39;m wrong.    </p>

This whole article confirms my opinion about Scientology that they are testing your emotional reactions to train you to be a sociopath.

    <div class="md"><p>I still completely disagree. Lucifer is vilified because he represents <em>good</em>, and the Jewish God for the goy &quot;Jesus&quot; represents their control over Christians, while Lucifer is secular. You can&#39;t be a truth-seeker, you can&#39;t be altruistic, you can&#39;t learn and grow without going through <em>them</em>. They are the middle men, and they want to cut the balls off anyone that tries. They control the narrative, the devil is suppose to deceive. Show me where Lucifer is Satan ??? It&#39;s fluff bs.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>And finding the most heinous who would be willing to become assassins for the organizations.</p>

<p>A method similar to this patent may have been used to identify and &quot;activate&quot; serial killers such as Dahmer, Bundy, Gacy, and BTK.</p>

<p>I have always thought it benefits certain people for the populace to believe that boogeymen like that just spontaneously appear.</p>

<p>For example Dahmer had 2 police men return one of his escaped victims to his apartment and we are supposed to believe it was simple incompetence.</p>

<p>And there is a picture of Gacy at the white house with the first lady.</p>

<p>This is kinda off topic, but my point is there would be many uses for accurate identification of psychos and sociopaths who are able to hide their evil tendencies.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>All these beliefs were extrapolated and assumed from what the bible says, while completely ignoring what the bible said explicitly.</p>

<p>All those beliefs I agree are rational and make sense and are easy to believe.</p>

<p>So why not hold on to the beliefs and drop the part where it says</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Luciferianism is a belief system that venerates the essential characteristics that are affixed to Lucifer.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Sociopaths are amazing convincers and manipulators because they know exactly what people want to hear, and they are willing and see no problem with blatantly lying about who they are and what they believe as long as it benefits them.</p>

<p>You are being baited in with generic albeit very good philosophy that is packaged with the glorification of Lucifer, a being who has NO source material talking about him being the good guy.</p>
