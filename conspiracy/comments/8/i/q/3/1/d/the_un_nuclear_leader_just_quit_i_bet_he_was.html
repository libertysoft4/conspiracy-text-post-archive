    <div class="md"><p>Because now Iran is going to try to build nukes and it&#39;s a much different situation than NOKO. The problem would be resolved if Russia cut ties with Iran and joined us in sanctioning the shit out of them. Iran isn&#39;t really even the same country it was 50 years ago and it&#39;s sad how much it&#39;s changed. Iranians are a beautiful people and it&#39;s not the residents I hate, it&#39;s their Islamic government. </p>

<p>They&#39;re not going to stop until their government is dismantled and rebuilt. </p>

<p>Believe me, id love to see Trump make some sweet deal but I doubt it would happen because ayatollahs government is just too evil.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The F35 lacks the range to get to Iran. I would need refueling by decidedly non stealthy jets. And even then if it is to carry the weapons in an internal stealthy configuration its weapons layout would be extremely limited. They also have only 9 jets. </p>

<p>Moreover, Iran&#39;s nuclear program is literally built into mountains and distributed around Iran.</p>

<p>Israel cannot reliably deliver sufficient bunker busters to do significant damage to damage their nuclear capability through conventional means in any meaningful way. </p>

<p>Even the US would struggle to knock out Iran&#39;s nuclear program from the air alone. </p>

<p>The whole war with Iran is people asking for a costly clusterf<em>ck because clearly Iraq was not enough and we want an even bigger clusterf</em>ck because Trump and Bibi are crooked morons. </p>

<p>Iran is a huge country... and not that close to Israel. Iraq was closer, Osirak was not re-enforced and even that attack did not significantly harm Iraq&#39;s program long term...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Iran doesn&#39;t want to nuke Israel. I&#39;m sure sone Iranians do, just as some Israelis want to nuke Iran and America too. You know jews hate Christians and muslims equally right? They believe Christians and muslims follow false prophets, which is punishable by death. Iran knows if they attack Israel, the US and Europe will destroy Iran. Would you kill someone if you know that you and your family would be killed because of it? </p>

<p>Iran is joining the EU and using the Euro. This hurts the US dollar which hurts Saudi and Israel too. Add in Netanyahu about to be removed and that&#39;s why This is happening. Iran surpassed Israel in biomed and other tech which is driving investors to them... Israel doesn&#39;t like to lose. Also, Israel wants Damascus bc that&#39;s where Abraham settled with Isaac and Jacob... </p>

<p>The bedrock of America is freedom of religion, but that governance must be free of religion... By supporting Iran Israel or Saudi, you are doing the most unamerican thing you can do. Kekk thinks you&#39;re a weak loser.</p>

Combined with how awful Clinton was, it was the perfect recipe for Trump to win.  Having said that, are you really that fucking dense?  Your reasoning for illegally invading a country is he exact same reasoning that people with similar mindsets cried out with Iraq and Libya, and continue to do so with Syria and Iran.  There are few people in the US who actually give a shit about what people like Assad and the Ayatollah are doing to their countries, and are more concerned with aligning with Israel and Saudi Arabia for money, power, and control over the region.  </p>

<p><em>&quot;Terrorism&quot;?</em> What an overused and abused term that is.

Iran doesn&#39;t want to destroy the US; they already got fucked multiple times by them and have every reason to hate the US. Secondly, the Irananians have seen the shit the US has done in the middle east and north africa. Nukes give you leverage.
Third, you&#39;re delusional if you think that Iran will fall easily; throughout their entire history they have been formidable foes and while, it is undoubted the US will win, Iran will fuck the US and its allies. A US-Iranian war will end up as a win for China.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Do you even know what UN means? Because UN isnt some magic entity, its a coalitions and alliances of nations who argue their side. For a time UN was heavily funded by US and hence US was the world dominant leader. Now things are changing and US isnt the global leader, and its US 1st policy is laughably arrogant. But moreover UN doesnt work atm you&#39;re right. If it did syrian false flag attacks would be dealt with an investigation before a launch of missiles. Perhaps its the role of US funding that plays a part in such system, idk. </p>

<p>Since we dont have a world gov, UNs role is purely to do with war, to do wih world security council in order to avoid ww3, and ww2 level of human life loss and destruction across europe, and if we had a world gov then Un would need to oversee global injustices. But that will only come with the age of AI because managing a huge coalition of nations and different races by people is a huge logistical nightmare, prone to oversight, corruption, inefficiencies, essentially a Bureaucratic hell, and one of the reasons why soviet union collapsed. </p>

<p>So asking UN to do what it isnt designed to do is just ignorance. But since UN is still like most of the world just an agreement to sit at a table, it is as corrupt as the rest of the nations who are a part of it who are corrupted. By money, greed, power, etc. But as a coalition of nations, it at the very min has an open forum to discuss shit, and the reason why syria was not allowed to be conquered like iraq (because iraq didnt have a UN security council sitting together discussing it, because it was a one sided engagement as russia wasnt a part of it)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So russia won syria in opposition to US after not being able to do anything in iraq because they were still a mess from collapse of soviet union in the 90s, and you think they are a part of US israel jewish conspiracy to rule middle east? Wtf kinda logic is that? </p>

<p>Russia iraqn syria and iraq are all dropping USD, iraq is co sidered a failed state, syria was succesful at deterring US invasion, if iran falls syria will fall as then it will be attacked from three fronts, iraq iran and isreal. Since IRAN is a huge nation, with support of Russia and growing global resentment towards US war efforts, I wouldnt be at all surprised that US will run out of steam internally before they have time to get iran. </p>

<p>The conspiracy here is why this type of &#39;conspiracy&#39; is being posted. Seeing as it doesnt even fit with the reality of global order atm... Missinformation, i bet its the growing trend accross reddit to paint russia as some greater global evil US has to destroy. Because god forbid their 74billion dollar a year millitary and globally located millitary and thousands of bases should just invade everyone. No wait thats US, russian economy can barely support their syrian, afganistan, and now ukranian war efforts. </p>

<p>As for nukes US pulled out of the agreements everytime. Now they pulled out of the iranian one, whilst israel who has nukes gets away with it, because they are &quot;willing to fund the whole thing&quot;. </p>

<p>No what I think will truely happen, is USs next election cycle will get a start of a socialist party or some political congress influx of socialists and they will manage to get a start at deconstructing the stronghold the current military industrial complex has over the system. No way Iran with support of syria and russia and possibly turkey will be fall. Not unless US uses their &#39;small yeild tactical nukes&#39;. But if they or isreal use nukes, be dammed sure most of the world is going to drop USD as well as deem US to be a hostlie threat to soverignity of nations rights to exist. China is already economically supiror as they produce way more than US, and US relies on china for production. </p>

<p>So the world doesnt want to go to ww3, US is playing these covert lie and lie again games with wmds and false flag chemical attacks. But as capitalism in most of the developed world is coming to an end, and it is, usd is also being threatened. Remember US capitalism can only survive by opening new markets to exploit. Since iraq is a failed state, syria is lost, iran is next. They havnt had any success stories like SK, Japan in over 30 years now. </p>

<p>OPs conspiracy isnt one, in fact I strongly believe that the world order is pushing towards global gov, but not the one US elite want. Because in that instance US isnt &#39;number 1&#39;....perhaps they are trialing UNs ability to over come corruption, and on a level its working, only UK, france and US are in unanimous support of syrian gas attacks before any investogation took place. Meaning, that the three most capitalist most allied nations of capitalism are banding together to save their model of living. Where as the rest of the world is moving towards a slower growth and development fase, amin to russian program becaude russians even in the face of sanctions by USs current world  dominant position are still seeing growth and development. </p>

<p>So to sum up, globolisation dream as US wanted it is dead. Middle east is lost to US, russia isnt part of some conspiracy to destroy middle east as they are in support of syria and iran and iraq is asking for russian help not US. World is changing and the loosing side is isreal-US, because if they try to repeat japan to win iran decisively with nukes, the whole world in order to avoid ww3 and nuclear desth will drop US and The othe two allies UK and france pretty quickly. </p>
