<p>you couldn’t even pay me to get on plane. </p>

<p>I would think that with human’s exponential technological advancements we would see a decline in number of instances, but that seems to be far from the reality. </p>

<p>could it be intentional? laxed maintenance regulation or enforcement of regulation? cheap labor? cheap parts? </p>

<p>a plane crashing or smoking and emergency landing almost every week, if not every other week seems to be too much of a coincidence to not have something more sinister lurking just beneath the surface. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>so you think airline companies having cabins fill up with unidentified smoke while operating, or windows being broken open via mechanical failure is “minor maintenance”? are you saying this has always happened at the same rate  it currently is but just wasn’t reported? i find that hard to believe. it seems profit margins are putting blinders on safety protocols</p>

<p>No... he&#39;s saying it was <em>more</em> common in the past but wasn&#39;t reported.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>i find that hard to believe</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What you &quot;believe&quot; is irrelevant. It is a fact.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/travel-truths/the-truth-about-emergencies-on-planes/">https://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/travel-truths/the-truth-about-emergencies-on-planes/</a></p>

<p><a href="http://abc7ny.com/archive/8441902/">http://abc7ny.com/archive/8441902/</a></p>

<p>That last article mentions the following:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>They did touchdown safely, but these kinds of emergency landings occurred 66 times at JFK from February through June of this year.</p>

<p>That&#39;s more than three times a week.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That was in 2011. Do you remember hearing about emergency landings three times a week in the first half of 2011? And that was just one airport.</p>
