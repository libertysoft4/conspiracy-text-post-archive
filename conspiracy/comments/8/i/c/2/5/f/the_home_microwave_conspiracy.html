<p>not true at all, different wavelengths have different energy levels.....meaning different effects. There&#39;s also ionizing vs nonionizing radiation. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I meant it in a layman&#39;s terms that overexposure to both of these that are used fairly frequently and most of us have come across can be harmful in case of overexposure.

    <div class="md"><p>Lol you should really read the links yourself sweetie. The first link doesn&#39;t provide any control group so the observations are insignificant as there is no other result to compare to.</p>

<p>And 2nd link in the intro section of the study-</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Every cooking method can destroy vitamins and other nutrients in food.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And the method used in the experiment is terrible. It involves heating food pellets (which we are given no information on the contents of) are heated at 320 degree Celsius. Microwaves heat up to an average of 100 degrees. So it&#39;s a demonstration of extreme burning of food in microwave. No shit there would be side effects. </p>

<p>If you expose food to direct hot flame do you think it&#39;s gonna stay healthy? Lol. Pathetic.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think all bets are off when the temperature approaches boiling point. At that point properties of heating via microwaves versus thermally are different. </p>

<p>So to warm up food in microwave is fine in my opinion (you might have to run the oven at 50% duty or so to allow for thermal relaxation and to prevent 100C hot spots). </p>

<p>To bake or cook in a microwave is just silly and asking for trouble. It is meant for warming up food.  </p>

<p>Also, you can nuke a cup of water to boiling point, and keep heating it without it turning into steam. Then when you take the cup out and stir or perturb the boiling water, it can suddenly all turn into steam, giving you severe burns. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sometimes there is no contrived conspiracy there is just routinary  complacency and commerce. </p>

<p>The study I showed the conclusions of is pretty straight forward and somewhat relevant to the general query of the OP.
The link is there for the curious.</p>

<p>It is not a gavel slamming case closed nor did I make that claim.</p>

<p>I could gather and link some more recent things but I&#39;m not married to the notion of trying to convince people one way or another.</p>

<p>The cumulative effect of so many sources of low level radiations surrounding us all of our daily lives is not known. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t use those ovens because I enjoy enough casual low level radiation in my day and like to get the most nutrition from the food I eat.</p>

<p>Funny story.
When the cable guy was installing my internet years ago he had a signal reader for wifi. It displayed all the neighbors incoming signals. I turned on my microwave the signal spiked madly.</p>

<p>I then asked my neighbor to run her microwave and across the driveway through our walls he picked up the signal clearly.</p>

<p>Her microwave was reaching my couch.</p>

<p>Don&#39;t want one anymore.</p>

As to getting nutrients from food - please explain how you think microwaving something destroys more nutrients?<br/>
You know what, I give up. By all means watch out for those deadly microwaves if it makes you feel better.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I will poat this as a reply to your comment as well. I have studied electromagnetism in depth.</p>

<p>Radio waves, radiation and microwaves are lower frequency light waves, they are of the same thing. An electrimagnetic wave in which the electric field and magnetic field propogate perpendicular to each other. There is very little, if any, harm from  waves in the ~2.4Ghz spectrum, it is the same as some wifi routers. Additionally microwaves are heavily shielded and do not leak radiation much/at all. If your microwave ever interferes with your wifi throw it out, it is leaking radiation something is broken.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yep, I won&#39;t use em. I did some research a while back and found an article in English that said microwaves were totally okay and another in Russian that said there were major health concerns. (This was years ago, but I&#39;ll post links if I find them.) And a Russian friend of mine says they were banned in Soviet times for health reasons. IIRC they essentially destroy most nutrition of the food.</p>

<p>Keep in mind that many (most?) US restaurants use microwaves to warm their pre-prepared meals. One more reason to prepare your own.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Consumer Reports stated no microwave you can buy screens all the escaping microwave radiation. They ALL LEAK. Here&#39;s how I checked mine.</p>

<p>Take a large parabolic stainless steel salad mixing bowl. Place a cup of water in your microwave. Turn it on. Now angle the salad bowl so it aims at the door like a satellite dish, toward the heating water. Angle the bowl up and down, left and right. </p>

<p>In my case the reflected microwave radiation <em>destroyed the machine, it flat failed, died!</em> That&#39;s the radiation your brain is getting while you fiddle with the creamer standing in front of it. </p>

<p>My microwave was tossed in a recycle bin and I will never replace it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My family had a device that would allow us to wirelessly send a signal from the satellite tv receiver in our living room, to the tv in our kitchen. That way you could watch in the kitchen without having to buy a new receiver. But every time someone would turn on the microwave, the signal would be disrupted. And you would get static until the microwave went off. So the microwaves definitely emit something.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Microwaved food is disgusting, that&#39;s why. I only use mine for defrosting bacon and cooking frozen vegetables for my kid, who is a picky eater and that is the only way we can get her to eat a vegetable now and then.</p>

<p>I totally get where you are coming from though. I can&#39;t remember if it was a thought I naturally had or if it was based off of something I read, but many years ago when microwaving food was I believe way more common, I wondered if the people who ate a lot of microwaved food would get cancer at a higher rate.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oooh, here&#39;s another fun fact about microwaves I know... I heard that in the original gulf war, the Iraqi&#39;s used to bury microwaves in the sand out in the desert door up, and rig them to work with the door open, and during raids turn them on to attract bombs. Something about the radiation looking like a large target to the electronic equipment guiding the bombs. So in effect they would trade a $100 microwave for a million dollar bomb. Of course I have no way of knowing if that is true or not.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Been wanting to do so experiments with microwaved water. Take two equal quantities of water. Microwave one to boiling and let cool and heat the other to boiling and let cool. Water plants with both. Or just microwave one and leave the other, and then water plants.</p>

<p>In theory the water should be the same, but who knows the world is a mysterious thing. Do we really KNOW for sure the microwave doesn&#39;t do something to the water to make it deleterious? Easily testable someday.</p>
