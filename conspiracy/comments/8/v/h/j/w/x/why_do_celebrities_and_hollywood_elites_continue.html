    <div class="md"><p>From what I’ve read and heard on podcasts Fukushima had a nuclear meltdown. I never heard about it until a few weeks ago</p>

<p>According to BBC in 2013 the situation was pretty fucked</p>

<p><a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/av/world-asia-pacific-23930132/fukushima-radiation-levels-18-times-higher-than-thought">https://www.bbc.com/news/av/world-asia-pacific-23930132/fukushima-radiation-levels-18-times-higher-than-thought</a></p>

<p>So either it’s really that bad, or it’s worse and the mainstream media is trying to keep things under control</p>

<p>While looking things up I come across things like this</p>

<p><a href="https://www.globalresearch.ca/28-signs-that-the-west-coast-is-being-absolutely-fried-with-nuclear-radiation-from-fukushima/5355280">https://www.globalresearch.ca/28-signs-that-the-west-coast-is-being-absolutely-fried-with-nuclear-radiation-from-fukushima/5355280</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>I’m not talking about the press, which is as manufactured and controlled in Japan as in every other “free” country.</p>

<p>I’m talking about the so-called contamination itself. In Tokyo after the earthquake there were several scares, including one local to me, about elevated radiation levels in food.</p>

<p>The thing is, nobody was checking radiation levels <em>before the earthquake</em>. Seven years later, radiation levels still occasionally and sporadically spike up or down here and there at the same rate as during the “crisis”.</p>

<p>This tells me it’s just background level radiation, with normal deviations from the average explained by localized radiation sources.</p>

<p>Then there’s the question of how bad those levels of radiation are anyway. The idea that all radiation is bad is nonsense, we are all constantly exposed to it no matter what steps we take to avoid it. Most of us have no idea what our normal daily exposure really is.</p>

<p>Tokyo dwellers like me have been enjoying domestic food that definitely isn’t contaminated (I own a calibrated Geiger counter), including fish from Pacific waters just a few tens or at most a couple of hundred miles from the Japanese coastline. So why is the west coast of America concerned when it is over 5,000 miles further away and separated from the (alleged) source of all this radiation by the world’s largest body of water, the best possible substance for diluting and dispersing radioactive material?</p>

<p>The answer is simple enough: fear makes people stupid.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you’re prepared to dismiss the entire branch of professional deception the BBC peddles, better known as media fakery, why would I bother trying to persuade you?</p>

<p>I’m not even clear what you’re expecting. Nitpicked minutiae? An example of someone being deliberately misrepresented <em>a la</em> tabloid journalism? An unretracted mistake I can point to and say “see! They got it <em>wrong</em>”.</p>

<p>I could certainly find examples like that, but sub-editing the BBC’s content is pointless. Think about your question. The Beeb tows the mainstream narrative, so what source could ever prove the BBC lies in a way you’d accept?</p>

<p>Textbooks? Academia? Scientists? The Internet? Lol</p>

<p>The BBC‘s job is to push mainstream propaganda into your psyche daily. They reinforce the underlying myths propping up our society through the use of emotive storytelling, although the BBC would prefer you call its mind-viruses “news” or “documentaries”.</p>

<p>🐟 🐟 🐟 🐟 </p>

<p>Tuna eat smaller fish <em>(with toxins,)</em> that eat smaller fish <em>(with toxins,)</em> that eat smaller fish <em>(with toxins,)</em> and so on.. </p>

<p>So whoever&#39;s at the top of the food chain eating the big fish, like tuna, are also getting all the toxins from all the other fish.</p>

<p>Fish &amp; Crab radiated from F’Shima!</p>

<p>The only reliable Source i have is from J. Cullen (Vancouver Aquarium, who i trust and he measured temporary a very, very small increase in 2015 but it returned back to “normal” quickly.</p>

<p>Also F.Shima is not “leaking like a Seibe” and they don’t use Seawater since 06/2011, in fact they use desalinated Seawater.</p>

<p>In 2016 1F. released roundabout 2 Billion Bq. per Day (see M. Aoyama); this sounds a lot but is Peanuts/ translated to 0.02 Bq/ Liter and there is no use for Concrete.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No. Fukushima is a HUGE problem. Owners of big corps in Hollywood probably aren’t worried about the celebs too much as there will always be new ppl lining up to be the next celebrity. Simply Hollywood and the whole LA scene inis huge and it would take a lot to move it all elsewher. The ownwers probably don’t swim I’m the ocean or eat from it, nor should anyone, really. I mean risk it for the biscuit if you want but it is polluted for sure. Anyway fuck Hollywood and all that bs, it’s just a tool to distract you from the truth. Just like this. Marine life is dying, fish that they catch for ppl to eat have elevated levels of radiation. It’s spread all through the Pacific Ocean. Sign on the Oregon Coast saying don’t touch debris that washes up on shore as it has  been contaminated by radiation. It’s going to take years for the real finding to come out,as more ppl continue eating and living around polluted areas we will see early deaths and levels of radiation through our the coming generations.. Hollywood gives no fucks. The Jews that run Hollywood are all about filling up the cup of sin and fucking the average man in the A as much as possible. It’s really just  sad this whole Fukushima melt down. The Pacific or any ocean has never been poisoned to these levels before. Scary times ahead my friend. </p>
