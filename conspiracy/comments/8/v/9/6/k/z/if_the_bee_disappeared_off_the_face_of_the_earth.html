<p>But it’s not just bees. Has anyone noticed how your car isn’t splattered with insects anymore ? I know in the UK it’s definitely noticable and someone from Germany has said the same. Somethings not right that’s for sure. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well at least we get less insect bites. But yes it’s alarming. Though from what I understand there is a tick that is partly responsible and the armed winters have failed to kill these ticks off. So basically we need colder winters according to the new keeper I spoke to. How it effects other insects I don’t know. But we all know pesticides play a massive role in this. Plus the destruction of wilderness. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Some forests in North America, mostly Canada, are being killed by the mountain pine beetle.  Several weeks of -40 weather is required each winter to keep the population in check, but those temps are becoming rare.  The result is mass die-offs of huge tracts of forest.  The wood turns blue and needs to be salvaged within a couple years or else it goes to waste.  The blue wood makes some neat furniture, but its an ominous sign.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Weird, me too! The insect thing I didnt agree with for my location, because although there seemed to be fewer amounts of certain species I&#39;ve noticed in the past few years, this year they seem more numerous (fireflies are one example, we&#39;ve had more of em than I&#39;ve seen for about 5-7 years). Sometimes swings happen so I didn&#39;t think much of that.</p>

<p>But I&#39;ve almost run over about 10 birds this year at least. That didn&#39;t want to move and barely did. I think i actually hit one today, I was heartbroken.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well there has been a huge change in how the insect population is controlled and also what controls them. </p>

<p>There has been a reintroduction of numerous animal species that were previously removed from areas either intentionally or unintentionally for various reasons but usually always revolving around protecting farms/livestock. Their removal originally intended to help farmers produce more food but there were numerous consequences to it. </p>

<p>We first removed predators from farms/livestock/living areas to protect against attacks from them. While it allowed livestock/people/property to be safer it had an unintended consequence of removing a population control feature of prey animals. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysa5OBhXz-Q">Here is a short video that explains this issue with added benefit of how people have started to fix it and with that a reason why insect populations have started to be controlled better</a>.</p>

<p>We next went after pest animals that had reproduced to extraordinary levels thanks to the above predator removal. This was to prevent them from eating the seeds, vegetables, etc... from farms. While it did work it too had numerous consequences that we didn&#39;t understand or think would happen. The animal pest removal had unintentionally also targeted non-pest animals which frequently ate pests i/e plant eating insects. This increased the number of insects and necessitated the need for the next issue.</p>

<p>When the insect population grew drastically as they could breed/reproduce unhindered or controlled, their damage to food production did as well. This caused us to create more deadly/efficient pest control chemicals to deal with the problem. These chemicals too killed indiscriminately and so non-pest insects(pollinators and even insects which preyed on pest insects) were equally effected. It also caused mutations to appear in pest insects(not just ones that eat plants but sucking/biting insects that preyed on animals) which caused them to become much harder to kill. Eventually these chemicals stopped being as useful. This growth in insect populations also effected non-agricultural regions and so insect levels were huge all over.</p>

<p>Another major issue was the introduction of foreign species which happened thanks to lax import regulations which allowed them to stow away on shipments or even in the ballast tanks of ships(<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zebra_mussel#North_American_invasion">as seen with the zebra mussel invasion of the great lakes</a>). These species had further devastating effects on native animals specifically fish and other water based animals. As with the zebra mussel invasion and numerous others, the invasive species reproduced drastically which starved native species of oxygen which caused mass die offs of fish which was very prevalent in the late 20th century. The die offs caused a further increase in insect populations as the population in fish/other animals that ate them or their eggs/babies lowered. The invasive species sometimes would not eat insects so their benefit to the environment was generally negative.</p>

<p>Over time we started to learn what went wrong, how we caused it, and what could we possibly do to deal with it. We started by basically going backwards to an extent to undo the above which too had side effects that were unintentional but positive. </p>

<p>Instead of indiscriminately spraying pesticides to control insect populations, instead vastly more specific chemicals were introduced as well as regulated to help cut down on run off. The way we sprayed also changed as well. A new approach was found in which insects were targeted where they bred as well as where their higher numbers were found. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_30jPKzWdN0">Here is a good video which discusses this concept through Disney&#39;s implementation of it</a>. This lowered the amount of pesticide used which again lowered run off.</p>

<p>That run off had unknowingly harmed animal species through various means which lowered their populations as well so the controlling efforts allowed a rebound effect of animal life. This population rebound caused a ripple effect which is discussed <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysa5OBhXz-Q">in this video</a>. </p>

<p>Pest animals were also better controlled/targeted which allowed the beneficial pest eating animals to no longer be killed. An example would be how birds are dealt with around airports. Prior times all birds would just be killed off to prevent bird strikes from happening. New strategies involved deterring birds from staying within the immediate surrounding areas such as using dogs to chase them away or even sound broadcasts. This meant the birds could stay in region and reproduce.</p>

<p>There is a vast amount of further steps that were taken but this comment has already become entirely too long so I won&#39;t get into them. </p>

<p><strong>TL:DR</strong></p>

<p><strong>Basically we started to undo all the damage that we caused in the 1800&#39;s/1900&#39;s which allowed animal life to come back to normal levels which lowered the insect populations towards what they naturally would have been. This is why people are seeing less insects in some areas as the unnatural swarms that were prevalent in the past became something of the past.</strong></p>

<p>I don&#39;t know if there are any studies comparing US and UK farmland with respect to insects, and there would be a ton of confounding variables (e.g. neonicotinoids being banned in the UK). A comparison of the northern US Midwest and Canadian central-southern region might be interesting if there are rules that only apply on one side of the border.</p>

<p>Has anyone noticed how your car isn’t splattered with insects anymore ?</p>

<p>I was thinking about this the other day while sitting on the back patio staring blankly off into space when I noticed that the bird feeder I filled a week ago hadn&#39;t been touched. If anything was eaten I couldn&#39;t tell. </p>

<p>It reminded me that I rarely run into common houseflies or mosquitoes anymore and I started to wonder what birds were eating (<em>definitely not the bird seed I was putting out</em>) with the decline of insects and of course upon looking it up I ran across the obvious in seconds... bird populations everywhere are drastically dropping. </p>

<p>This is going to keep trickling through the food chain and the end isn&#39;t going to be pretty.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That’s normal. I believe 2017 was a mast year. A year with a lot of acorns falling from trees. There is a known correlation of mast years and ticks. More acorns means more food for small animals like mice. More ticks feed on the mice and can produce more eggs. The following year the tick population soars because of the abundant food the previous year. This happens about once every 5 years or so. </p>

Thought about telling him to look and remember because <em>his</em> kids might not ever see such a magical thing, but I didn&#39;t want to existentially scare him so I just kept my mouth shut.</p>

<p>My husband and I kept bees for the last ten years or so. We&#39;re not starting any hives this year because they&#39;ve done so poorly the last couple of years. It gets depressing to watch after awhile.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>For what it’s worth, if you think immigration is a manufactured issue, wouldn’t it clearly be created by the administration that institutes cruel and dehumanizing policies? I personally believe Trump is filling the role of “headline creator and red herring instigator.” You’re pretty transfixed by the Stormy Daniels thing, but can you admit that Trump being a media lightning rod is in part because of his own ridiculous actions? Him using Twitter for insults and casual foreign policy is exactly what draws people away from his appointees like Pruitt raping the environment. Now, irresponsible and profit-driven news agencies pour fuel on the fire as well, but do you really think this is a “liberal/conservative” issue?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>no, but i believe the liberals are being bamboozled into reacting emotionally to  events and news cycles,  Save the immigrant children!  Maybe instead of blindly saying Trump is a monster, you actually look at who is putting the kids at risk, their own parents.  Seriously, is Trump responsible for the conditions in third world countries that cause parents to risk their child&#39;s lives by traveling across deserts and oceans, and eventually arrive at a border they know is illegal to cross? Is Trump responsible for the consequences of their actions, one of them being the separation from their children while they are held in detention?  The responsibility is solely the parent&#39;s who bring their children.  Nobody is forcing them, they are making choices, and they, and their children unfortunately, must bare the consequences.  Do you have any friends or family that immigrated legally by chance? I have several of both, and they are opposed to illegal immigration as well.  They worked hard to get here by the rules, because they wanted to be a contributor instead of a taker.  </p>

I have done about 3 inspections of the hive and it has gotten easier with each go.  If you have a little bit of room, I would suggest looking into starting a colony.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Honestly I don&#39;t even notice them.  The only time I see a large amount of them, and that&#39;s just by the hive, is when all the bees go out to learn to fly.  You inspect just to make sure everything is going well.  That egg laying patterns are correct as well as if you need to expand your hive.  Also like to make sure that I get my eyes on the queen and that she is ok.  Technically they can be left alone but by inspecting I could potentially catch something that would normally kill the colony</p>

<p>Sure we will have to get other insects to do the job of pollenizers that we currently use bee keepers for but it&#39;s not the end of days people are making it out to be.  Will losing honey bees cause a negative impact.  Yes of course.  Will it lead to world wide famine? No not even close. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Scientific fact, domestic honey bees are actually invasive species to the majority of ecosystems. Other life forms served the role of pollinators for millions pf years just fine until human used the domestic bees to out compete the native pollinators. Declining domestic bee population is bad for honey and food industry. But actually good for native species.</p>

<p>Also ecosystem are a lot more resilient than you think. One or two years of low insect populations is nothing to be alarmed of.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I just want to point out that I work with a lot of bee keepers in a university setting. It seems thay bee drop that started a long time ago was due to a microscopic pathogen( sorry can remember if virus or bacterial) and that led to the large population decline. Their numbers have been recovering poorly due to competition by predators. They tried to create new hybrids merging the honey bee with African bees to increase the resistance to the pathogen, but the recovery process is long and the news bees show much higher levels of aggression</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I’m in Edinburgh and we actually seem to have an abundance of big fuzzy bumblebees in my garden (near coastal area) right now and at any time I’m out in the back They’re always buzzing at my oriental Lily and foxglove, and a lot of them are living under my back door step where there’s a slot between the slabs (someone said they’re masonry bees but those are meant to be solitary, these go in in groups sometimes of six a time so I think it’s a growing colony - started with one or two but seems to be getting more busy).  I won’t let my mum block the step up to prevent them because they don’t attack us, they just back and forth over the garden enjoying the flowers and go back to the step and disappear inside.  Freaks my mum out but they seem pretty non aggressive considering their nest is right where we’re standing or near our bench where we sit a lot.  Guess they lucked out finding a nest three feet from lots of flowers and seven feet from flowering shrubs.  We don’t interfere with their routes really.</p>

<p>First time in 8 years I’ve lived here I’ve seen so much bee activity. Makes me wonder if they’re maybe doing better this year, especially with the heatwave meaning flowers are growing better, hope so, anyway.  I’m happy to see them, something about bees makes me smile.  I watch them as I have my morning coffee. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is what&#39;s gong on in Massachusetts, USA for several years.  </p>

<p>none of the usual sounds of nighthawks during the evening, night and dawn during spring and summer for two years now
I&#39;ve heard their raspy squeaks every year of my life during the warm season, but this year there were only a few at the beginning of the warm weather.  I heard one again the evening of June 29.  Since then none.
(nighthawk sounds: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aHlV7syK1Q">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aHlV7syK1Q</a>)</p>

<p>abnormally few crickets singing
only a scattering of junebugs buzzing 
too few katydid click noises from the up in trees where they should have been
All these insects started their noises much later in the summer than normal. There were more cricket sounds on some nights than others, though still oddly few of them, and it seemed like something happened on certain days that either killed or incapacitated a lot of them with the noise of very few, and then they&#39;d be back a few nights later but there were still much fewer than there should be.  Some nights only one or two crickets were making noise. </p>

<p>All the summers I can remember little green leaf hoppers managed to get insde in spite of screens attracted by inside lights on during nightime.  They came to pop around the light I sit by, but this year I saw maybe two.
No flies!
none of the usual scent of skunk outside where in years past they&#39;ve come to drink from the fountain outside in warm weather 
no smell of skunk sprayed on some cat or dog or raccoon during an encounter</p>

<p>I saw only one squirrel last spring, and very few the last year.  They should be jumping around the tree branches outside my window, but there are none, and I saw no dead squirrels run over by cars during spring mating season which is a predicable occurance every spring.</p>

<p>awful silence last fall instead of starlings&#39; yearly pre-roosting sounds
Many should have gathered in the nearby pine trees as they always have during fall, but they didn&#39;t. None at all. (starling sounds: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4pHGgV2Fqo">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4pHGgV2Fqo</a>)</p>

<p>Bluejays have been outside last autumn, and the sounds they make are nothing like I&#39;ve ever heard.  They sound scary and abnormal, and as if they&#39;re in distress.  </p>

<p>no more gangs of sparrows on the trees outside my windows last spring and summer-only a handful some mornings and other days none at all</p>

<p>Not one mosquito got into my apartment all last summer.<br/>
No green leafhoppers, and very few of those tiny gnats(?) got in at night attracted by the artificial lights.  It&#39;s expected there&#39;d be many as in past summers.</p>

<p>Gonzo.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>Has anyone noticed how your car isn’t splattered with insects anymore ?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I was thinking about this the other day while sitting on the back patio staring blankly off into space when I noticed that the bird feeder I filled a week ago hadn&#39;t been touched. If anything was eaten I couldn&#39;t tell. </p>

<p>It reminded me that I rarely run into common houseflies or mosquitoes anymore and I started to wonder what birds were eating (<em>definitely not the bird seed I was putting out</em>) with the decline of insects and of course upon looking it up I ran across the obvious in seconds... bird populations everywhere are drastically dropping. </p>

<p>This is going to keep trickling through the food chain and the end isn&#39;t going to be pretty.</p>
