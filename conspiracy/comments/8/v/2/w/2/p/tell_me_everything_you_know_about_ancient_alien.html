<p>I kinda let that go because nothing in entirely conclusive.</p>

<p>In my opinion, the best information we have is the aboriginal cave paintings. Of course, that could just be all imagination, but I believe their appearances, as well as similar looking paintings worldwide, and their myths correlate to alien theories.</p>

<p>Then Hindus have something that can correlate to ancient aliens but I forget the word right now.</p>

<p>Some people use the nephlim in the Bible as alien evidence, I&#39;m not too sure on that. However, there are quite a few old Christian paintings that <em>clearly</em> have ufos in the back ground.</p>

<p>I was on listverse a few months ago ( great website Imo) and there was a list about moon theories. One theory is that there are a few ancient writings that mention a time before the moon was here. Of course you could say that is that it was brought here by aliens as a base of sorts. I think it&#39;s mentioned by Greek writers.</p>

<p>The most out there theory I have heard  is that our alien creators mime our souls for energy. When we die, they deceive us from going to the true afterlife and simply transport us to another body and we forget everything. This kinda of relates to what I heard back in 2012 that there was an alien overlord race that used earth as an energy supply or something.</p>

<p>I can&#39;t provide links right now on my phone but I&#39;ll be than happy when I&#39;m on my laptop </p>

    <div class="md"><p>No the earth is still the same age but at some point there was a civilization that wasn&#39;t as advanced as us when it came to electronics but was far more advanced in other ways. The current theory is that there was an asteroid that landed in North America about 12000 years ago during the ice age. It heated millions of gallons of ice so fast that it caused a global flood, and just like modern times, most cities were near the coast. This caused a near extinction level event and destroyed our entire history. The cave paintings were remnants of those that survived. Just like today we have people that know how a computer is built, but do you? We have people that can paint pictures that look hyper realistic, but can you? I can do stick figures at my best lmao. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Very advanced in astronomy, very spiritually and socially advanced. Some evidence of higher technology as well. Ancient ruins in India have evidence of nuclear irradiation and completely glassed rock and earth from what would seem to be bombs. Not to mention all the stones they moved! It&#39;s repetitive but seriously how the hell did they move some of those? Stones so big that we can BARELY move them with modern advanced machinery. I personally believe they knew how to harness energy. Specifically sonic engery, research in the last few years has show that matter will levitate when vibrated at specific frequencies. Maybe past civilizations knew how to do this? Would explain Asian beliefs in chanting and meditation </p>

    <div class="md"><p>May I add to the past civilizations that perished?</p>

<p>You have heard of Mu and Telosians? It was stated that Mu and Atlantis lived on opposite sides of America peacefully. One day something changed and then nuclear war broke out, destroying both land masses. It was said that Atlantis and Mu sank, but a piece of Mu broke off into what is now California. When this happened, a Million Telosians from Mu had migrated under Mount Shasta here in Northern California.</p>

<p>History repeats itself, so maybe we are all heading to the same fate as before? People have said that Mars use to be thriving until a Nuclear Holocaust happened which left the whole planet in shit.</p>

<p>What would be the explanation for not being able to find remnants of this the flood would kill man and destroy structures and technology, but much of the debris would exist.</p>

<p>Imagine if something like this happened to NYC. The skyscrapers might collapse, but people would be finding pieces of the skyscrapers for at least thousands of years.</p>

<p>Perhaps we will find remnants of this lost world someday, but I am curious about opinions on why we haven&#39;t really yet?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No doubt. But I think we were discussing advanced civilizations that had advanced technologies, such as spacecraft, etc... We have found cities. There were definitely some advanced civilizations in that respect, but what evidence is there that they had capabilities more advanced than modern man?</p>

<p>These lost cities being found so far don&#39;t seem to have been any more advanced than civilizations that we have discovered on land, intact from around the same times.</p>

<p>It&#39;s not so much that I am over-estimating it, I am saying that there would be at least some remnants. To insist that they would all simply vanish would mean that we wouldn&#39;t have remnants of the inferior structures built thousands of years ago. Or bones of dinosaurs, etc..</p>

<p>There would be some remnants. Wouldn&#39;t there?</p>

<p>Unless we are talking millions, perhaps billions of years ago, even beyond dinosaurs. Then what remnants that would survive would be buried under rock.</p>

<p>Like I said, maybe at some point we will find some remnants that managed to survive.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is the reason I faded away from researching it.</p>

<p>Nothing is conclusive. Sure we have a bunch of ancient art and cave paintings but those can easily be explained away by saying it was artists imagination.</p>

<p>I was watching a video about cave paintings last night and one interesting point was that these ancient people drew what they saw...mostly everyday stuff like animals, cooking, hunting, etc. And then you have a Strang figure with huge eyes, seemingly a suite and helmet, and such. They correlate to how we imagine aliens in modern times and some ancient cave paintings on other countries look alike.</p>

<p>Everything is just correlation and speculation.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, it doesn’t surprise me that past civilizations were so in tune with space. They needed to be otherwise agriculture would have never developed.</p>

<p>As far as paintings go, I think they are  part historical record, part imagination, part people on drugs(no idea why but people who trip tend to have some of the experiences throughout time) and possibly a record of aliens. There is no definitive answer.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have never used DMT. I have tripped. My most profundity trip was salvia extract. I experienced what I only got a glimpse of with mushrooms. </p>

<p>During my salvia trip I was granted access to what I can only describe as the programming/coding of the world. I saw everything as sacred geometry and the what is made of on an atomic level.</p>

<p>I think drugs like DMT and salvia let people go places they are not supposed to go. Or maybe we are allowed to go there but wide knowledge of these places has been lost to time.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I welcome skepticism. I haven&#39;t tripped in a decade plus but I&#39;ll give you a rundown of my experiences. I fully admit that some drugs are for a fun time. </p>

<p>MJ: Experiences are commonly drummed up. The most intense thing you can experience is paranoia.</p>

<p>Mushrooms: I used to trip a lot on shrooms. Tbh probably way more than anyone should. With mushrooms atmosphere is important. You don&#39;t want to take them if you are in a bad place mentally. In the same breath if you go looking for a spiritual experience you may find it or convince yourself of it. </p>

<p>Mushrooms are mostly a mental trip/perception trip rather than visual. More than anything time plays games with you ex. a minute can seem like hours. Physical sensations are also different. Swimming or taking a shower is well very different lol</p>

<p>imo every time you trip on mushrooms it is like flipping the breaker box of your mind. It changes your personality. I wouldn&#39;t say in a bad way but things like your sense of humor change a little bit each time you trip.</p>

<p>To really get the full blown mushroom experience you need to push yourself to the limit. My most intense experience was with a 14 grams of very potent mushrooms. Really... no one should do that. To even consider doing that you should be very familiar with tripping(a normal dosage of average mushrooms is 1.75-3.5 grams of average mushrooms). Everything was so different but familiar. There was an overwhelming feeling of never coming down. You get that sometimes with mushrooms but it was more &quot;this is my life now&quot; than &quot;never coming down&quot;. Basically a general acceptance that from now on things might be different for good.</p>

<p>Salvia/Peyote/DMT etc: This stuff is more than just tripping. It takes you to another dimension/universe. A user can expect every type of hallucination imaginable. Honestly, I think these drugs really do take someone somewhere else or let you experience things that are hidden to everyone else. I only tried salvia. Partly because there are some places you don&#39;t want to go. </p>

<p>Hopefully my ramblings help you understand this stuff a bit more.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It changes you. How much it changes you really has to do with dosage, the experience etc. People said I was different before I ever thought of it. </p>

<p>It&#39;ll probably be easier to find one of the 2C drugs, acid, mushrooms, or Mescaline containing cacti from what i know. I don&#39;t wanna touch anything man-made again, so mushrooms seem to be the easiest to find </p>

Sounds weird I know but the first to times I did it it was incredible also but it is so intense that i was afraid to take that step. A friend did it on his first try so it’s possible.</p>

<p>But beware. There is no guarantee that it will be a nice experience. Some i know won’t do it again.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Only god really knows the truth, and maybe it is something truly inter-dimensional like david icke believes.<br/>
I can tell you one thing, our society is building up towards something, the drain happening to the masses right now cant be sustained spiritually, physically, or economically if that makes sense. There are literally to many people, a system that seemed to be designed that way in the first place, in the past when humans were to high in population, plagues and things would keep their numbers down, its strange that some plague storys talk about flying craft and a deadly fog that they dispensed back in medieval times, seems like a strange story to just make up. I find it bizzarre that there is so much of this stuff mentioned in history but its like it is being erased.  Which brings me to my next point.</p>

<p>If we really want to know what is going on, we need to understand where mankind comes from, but thats the funny thing isnt it, its a highly debatable topic with many people turning to religion for that answer.  The bible is only a couple thousand years old, probably based on storys much older than that.  And the other 1/2 believe science can explain our spontaneous evolution on this planet. Anything that doesn&#39;t fit into those two categories is dismissed, and if you ask me most likely destroyed, either by destroying the evidence or destroying the careers of anyone who dares to question the narrative. A good example of this, ww2, hitler and his financial backers gained access to some pretty important librarys and while they burned books that inspired people with freedom or to question or authority or whatever, he was raiding the librarys as if almost like he were looking for something, part of me wonders if it has anything to do with the bibles and religious artifacts that germany supposedly had, part of it being this. (another part of me thinks about the space battle that took over germany in the 1600&#39;s?, is it possible germany hid away some of the wreckage that fell from the sky that day)</p>

The New Testament was first published in 1522 and the complete <strong>Bible</strong>, containing the <strong>Old</strong> and New Testaments and Apocrypha, in 1534. The project absorbed Luther&#39;s later years. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>I think if people could read the original bibles without the translations done by people with a agenda, they would start to read it more like a science fiction novel, i know that even reading the king james bible can be like that, talking about angels descending from heaven and killing thousands of soldiers with the flash of a light. Its not hard to make this connection by any means, but mainstream will never accept this, again instead any real evidence is very quickly dismissed as false for whatever reason and then like i said either destroyed or the credibility of the researcher is destroyed, or worse. </p>

<p>At this point, im pretty much convinced aliens helped create us, I just have no idea what they want, could be like that sumerian legend, there were different factions (kind sounds like greek and their gods) and they had a battle, the &quot;good&quot; side won, the other side didnt, but instead was locked up away forever. (if they know enough to manipulate dna, its possible they could live forever, its possible humans were once capable of living much longer lives also, but had their lives shortened to make them easier to control, we could live hundreds of years, and never stop finding things to learn). If thats the case, maybe its possible the moon was hauled here a couple hundred million years or so ago as a base, indian epics talk about a huge mothership with smaller ships descending from it and sumerians legends talk about a god who went to the moon to watch over earth and study it for a hundred years. Just seems like some crazy stuff to make up when these people should have no concept of space, or earth as a hurtling rock through space, but again were taught our ancestors slowly evolved from monkeys even though there is no real evidence of that. I wish they would just tell us the truth, I know something is going on, and 90&amp;#37; of people are oblivious, or they just dont care. </p>

<p>I often find myself asking people though, if a alien created your ancestors, taught them everything about life, would you consider them a god? I know some people would, some cultures believe that all you require to be a god is power, ultimate power, what is ultimate power though? Immortality? The strength to destroy anyone who stands before you? Its all pretty relative :/. </p>

<p>I also find it strange that the bible very clearly states, mankind was created in &quot;<strong>OUR</strong>&quot; image. Trust me, thats not a typo. </p>

<p>And this was a heck of a rant, id be surprised if someone actually read it, i know its not very clear or concise, but ive said a few things I have wanted to say, but the last thing I should leave off with that I have been thinking about. </p>

<p>I used to think technology was great, then I started to see how it brings out the evil in humanity, I often wondered, does this make technology evil, kind of like how the bible says that this kind of technology is gods realm and makes people evil, (really hard to deny that when you take a step back from our society today and realize the kinds of horrors that are happening all for what, money? , control?, all thanks to &quot;technology&quot; ) but then it hit me. Humanity is a young species, we have yet to learn our role in this universe  and the power that we have in it, without that knowledge, respect, and control, having the power that &quot;technology&quot; grants humans is a really bad, bad idea, that is as plain as day to me, what is not so clear to me is most of humanity being repressed on purpose, or are we just still to new as a species, or maybe a mixture of both, thats what I mean when I say only god truly knows the truth. </p>

<p>And I dont know about all I said, it is just what makes sense to my mind, but One thing I DO know for DAMN SURE.</p>

<p>Life does not exist anywhere for the pure purpose of suffering, and thats what our world is right now, nothing but a huge ball of suffering, and that depresses me, everyday.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I believe that there is one true God and he has created many beings in his likeness. </p>

<p>Another interesting read on all of this is the Annunaki and their involvement with the evolution of man.  See link below.  This could be why humans look somewhat similar to aliens.  </p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJJjOKmwl6s">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJJjOKmwl6s</a></p>

<p>The Annunaki created man as a means to mine monatomic gold. Apparently, it was too much work for them and they wanted to create a slave that they could control.  They mixed their DNA with that of an ape or ancient human.</p>

<p>Look up information on the Sumerian Tablet  and the Epic of Gilgamesh.  Its really interesting how all of this aligns with the Bible and its account of Adam/Eve.   </p>

<p>Who knows the origin of the tablets, it could be the world&#39;s oldest account of fiction.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I read your response and you DID answer my question but i just dont agree with it though. Id like to ask you to reconsider your response.</p>

<p>Im just confused because the life on earth is incredibly diverse. How can the annunaki have evolved on another planet,  but yet be so similar shaped to the pre-human??</p>

<p>Its not logically making sense to me that creatures evolved on separate planets have similar shape and stature. In art it dipicts the &quot;angels&quot; or &quot;annunaki&quot; as very similar looking to us. </p>

<p>I understand that humans look like annunaki because they designed us to look like them. Im familiar with the theory. But what about the pre-human??? Why are animals evolving so similarly on different planets with different climates. Its not logically making sense to me. </p>

<p><em>insert list of animals that look nothing alike humans, like squid and whales</em> the life on earth is SO diverse , i need to emphasize this. I just feel like this logic throws a wrench into the theory. Im definately aware of the massive spooky futuristic advanced stone structures all over the earth that might be indicating a history of another alien species influencing things on earth. But i still am seeing flawed logic in the details of the annunaki theory</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, this is all just theory.  There is no way that we can go back and factually check the Sumerian tablets in any way.  </p>

<p>Annunaki were here when heaven and earth were created. The tablet  posits that the Annunaki were made up of 2 tribes, a lesser tribe (enki) and greater tribe (Anuna).  The Anuna made the Enki mine for gold and the Enki revolted and forced them to create a new slave race.  This is when they started to do genetic testing, this is where supposed hominids were created.  This COULD mean all forms.  Its difficult to fact check or think logically about a story that is ancient.  Trying to glean logic from the tablets is problematic.  About all you can do is align what the tablets say about Adam and Eve with the bible, the great flood is also referenced.  </p>

<p>No one can prove any of this.  You can just look at what evidence is available and form an opinion. It&#39;s up to you to have faith. </p>

1. The Crucifixion. We can see from earlier examples that the sun and moon being displayed was a common theme and this is just a weird take on that already existing theme.
2. Epiphany. The Epiphany is seen in Christianity as a revelation of the Trinity. The Son is baptized, the Spirit descends, and the Father speaks. The Son and the Spirit are usually displaced the same way because the visually participated in the event, but because the Father only participated vocally He will be portrayed by different people in different ways, in this case the circle around the Spirirt</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have an even more bizarre thought that I had been chewing on for the last few years, but haven&#39;t seen people discuss before (if you know of sources, please tell me!)</p>

<p>What if planets are formed by the sun burping matter out into outer space. And what if these planets are very slowly moving away from the sun. The position of the Earth in this system is what made it ideal for life, but what happens when we lose that position? Would Venus move into position and slowly become the new earth with flourishing life, while the Earth becomes a Mars-like planet?</p>

<p>What I am trying to say is what if Mars and planets beyond Earth were once in the orbital position of Earth and supported life at one time before being pushed out of that position. Ancient civilizations would have flourished on Mars for billions of years before this happened. Materials and evidence of that civilization would have long ago deteriorated?</p>

<p>But what if some civilization figured out a way to survive this before it happened and found a way to jump to Earth or even possibly learn how to survive on the hostile planet being pushed out (but perhaps need to occasionally obtain resources from Earth, so need to visit)?</p>

<p>Has anyone seen any discussions of this theory before? Even if it had been debunked. I would love to read about it.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>This, I&#39;ve never done DMT, but I&#39;ve dabbled in the occult, and then in the metaphysical. It wasn&#39;t worth it imo. However, I would use the word knowledge over wisdom. IMO knowledge would be the things you learn, and wisdom would be knowing the right thing to do with that knowledge, how to handle it, etc.</p>

<p>I had the knowledge, but not the wisdom.</p>

<p>I tried summoning a demon as a teenager, something came through and followed me around for about 5 years. Sleep paralysis became frequent in that time.</p>

<p>I opened my third eye and it messed with me too much. I started having paranormal experiences, not always bad, but some were freaky. </p>

<p>I reached out to aliens at one point, and that was the biggest fuck up. I was meditating, I put that energy into the universe that I wanted to communicate with an ET. About 5 minutes later, not even thinking about aliens, trying to clear my chakra, BOOM the image of a grey popped into my mind, clearer than any image I ever thought on my own. That was a big mistake. I started getting nightmares, usually it would be me walking in my house when I notice a window open, so I go to close it and there&#39;s 1 or 2 greys standing outside of it, I&#39;d freeze up, then eventually wake up screaming, except when I woke up, I had no clue why I was screaming, I wouldn&#39;t remember the dream til later in the day.</p>

<p>So when I wasn&#39;t getting sleep paralysis, I was having night terrors.</p>

<p>Then one time, I had sleep paralysis, and for the first time after years of it happening, I actually saw something floating over me, long story short, I freaked, tried to wake up, astral projected, ended up trying to push it out of my house yelling everything I had read about demons at it, eventually I remembered reading that the name of Christ had power over demons(was agnostic at the time, I believed something was out there, but not God or Jesus.), I said &quot;In the name of Jesus Christ, you are NOT allowed to be here!&quot; Poof, it was gone, and I was sucked back into my body where I woke right up. That was the last time I had sleep paralysis. I was done, I stopped meditating and reading about the metaphysical. As time went on, the night terrors stopped too.</p>

<p>Sorry for my ramble, but I agree with what you said. If you have an interest in these types of things, its best to just read and study them, but NEVER act on the knowledge. And if you do want to act on it, you need to study for years at least, and work on your mental and spiritual sanity. Otherwise you&#39;re just going to open a can of worms.</p>

<p>The human mind in its untrained form is not fit to handle the power that can come with the occult and metaphysical. I don&#39;t know the actual process, but I&#39;m sure that shaman and others of the like study and train their mind for 10-20-30 years before they even attempt anything serious like opening their third eye or contacting otherwise unseen entities.</p>

<p>No, Aliens did not build stone henge, the pyramids of giza, chichen itza, the bosnian pyramid or gobekli tepe. We humans did. Elites do not want humanity to know what we are capable of-hence the ancient aliens psy op to explain it all away.

    <div class="md"><p>I have read theories like this before, and part of me believes it, in a reverse psychology sort of way.</p>

<p>Often we are told to go towards the light, the <em>it</em> is God and heaven. Another part thinks this is all part of misguiding us from God&#39;s true light. I&#39;ve been reading more of Gnosticism lately, so who knows.</p>

<p>My conclusion: If we go towards the light and are lied to,my consciousness won&#39;t remember and the <em>me</em> that i know will die. If i reject the light and go into darkness/whatever it is, i&#39;ll either be reincarnated the <em>me</em> i know is still gone or i&#39;ll experience the universe and one for what it really is...Or the darkness could really be a hell-ish plane...who knows. I guess my heart will tell me which way to go. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That video was a trip. It sounds crazy but it makes sense with an open mind. It explains why ive been lied to and why history is forgotten. </p>

<p>The false history i was taught as a child doesn&#39;t resonate with me like this does. This video explains the strange behavior of our world leaders to me a little. </p>

<p>If this were true i wonder what it would take for people to believe it. I now believe the bigfoot 1967  footage is real now , which sounds crazy to admit. I feel like a  nutjob , that there wasnt much in the lecture i found disagreeable. </p>

<p>Its true that i never learned about the sumarians in school and it was minimized how much knowledge they really had. Then when you see all of these megalythic stone structures around the earth its clear there is a more rich history waiting to be unearthed. There is some great deception and mind games from our slave owning world leaders.</p>

<p>Lloyd pye was arguing that we descended from pre-humans that were inter-bread with aliens. That they designed us to look similar to themselves but inferior as a slave race. My question is this: why are aliens described with a similar bone structure to pre-humans? Why are they also upright and walking creatures with similar bone structures if they evolved on another planet?? This makes me believe that he could possibly be wrong about some details of his theory. But i accept what the sumarians knew as our real history though</p>

    <div class="md"><p>no i was talking about Pyle&#39;s theory. you misunderstood. He gave a date 250,000 years ago that aliens reduced the amount of chromosomes and MATED with a neanderthal type creature. It actually doesn&#39;t matter to me whether or not we could walk upright beforehand, thats not at all what I&#39;m asking about.</p>

<p>he explained how our skin is more similar to the aliens than an ape. so these aliens evolved on another planet to live in different conditions.</p>

<p>But in our ancient art, it depicts the aliens as looking exactly like us except they had horns, pyle described.</p>

<p>My question still remains, how were the aliens so similar shaped with similar skeletal features and the same amount of limbs. They were so similar to us that they only needed to adjust the DNA to mate with us... Meaning they have reproductive organs like us im guessing too? </p>

<p>If an alien evolved completely separate from us on another planet i would expect that creature to have tentacles or resemble a much different creature than an ape or human. </p>
