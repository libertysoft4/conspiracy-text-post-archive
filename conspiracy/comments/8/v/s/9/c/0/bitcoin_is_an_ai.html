<p>Crypto of any kind must find the most unfindable patterns in the universe of patterns of sequential one&#39;s and zero&#39;s - binary numbers. That characteristic differentiates a good crypto solution, which is hard to find - or guess - from a crypto that is easy to break.</p>

<p>What is the crucial step that ties together a search for good crypto candidate patterns and a parallel search for interesting algorithms or other scientifically useful patterns? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>So what?  We could use the tech to create a distributed and stable AI.  Thats my main point.</p>

<p>The mining algorithm takes tons of resources tondo very little work.</p>

<p>Figured those resources could be doing something more than just mining.</p>

<p>And judt because you can take the bitcoinncode, load it on a machine and watch do work doesnt mean that there are other parts of the bitcoin business, since the machines talk, that would load new code into your mining process to change it from what you loaded.</p>

<p>It would be easy to do.</p>

<p>That and its called crypto currency despite the fact that it is less crypto than cash.  </p>

<p>The misnomer has bothered me for 10 years now.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, and I can.  The thing is the algorithm to mine coins and what keeps the coins scarce.</p>

<p>Why not just calculate more digits of pie or find every prime number?</p>

<p>What is the formula actually doing to spot out a coin?</p>

<p>It isnt the code thats hard its the math in the algorithm.  Code is just another language to describe math, sure, but you can desribe things without understanding it.</p>

<p>I feel like this formula describes something that I dont know.</p>

<p>Hence the conspiracy theory.  Not that I really believe in it but its like a &quot;it could be maybe&quot;.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah?</p>

<p>Just because &quot;in the source code&quot; it doesnt exist doesnt mean the code couldnt change as soon as it starts running and connects to the global bitcoin thing.</p>

<p>I do software too.  Moving into medical AI.</p>

<p>Besides, where and why is bitcoin enceyption?  Its just a large ledger.  No encryption necessary except for uniwue keys.  You dont need encryption to keep the keys unique, you just need an abundance of consensus.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, the processing power and electeicity use.</p>

<p>Bitcoin mining consumes way more electricity just for processing than anything else on earth.  More electricity is used for that than some large countries use in a year.</p>

<p>And I didnt mean bitcoin specifically.  You could build an AI into the mining algorithm and distribute that algorithm globally.  Then through emergent behavior of that algorithm the AI would come alive and start handing out coins like taking a dump, or something.</p>

<p>I do coding.  I understand it.</p>

<p>The crux of myargument is this:  someone created bitcoin, started up the network, owned most miners and THEN gave out the code.</p>

<p>The core code that started it could be different.  When you start mining you connect to the network and exchange information.</p>

<p>Some of that information could be designed to alter the way your miner functions, changing the code from what you see as open source to the closed source variant.</p>

<p>That change in behavior could be the code for a distributed AI.</p>

<p>Meaning that I can understand something better than you, implement it, and get good results.  Describe it to you without divulging the good results. Then have you tell me I dont understand.</p>

<p>Get it?  Happens with me alot.  I have a problem to solve.  Talk it out with smart people.  Understand the concept.  Build the solution.  Describe my approach.  Get told I am wrong and it wont work.  Then show them it working.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You clearly do not have any background on IT.</p>

<p>You can think whatever you want, but sometimes you should stop and take a look in the mirror, maybe find a psicologist to help you with paranoia over things YOU CLEARLY do not understand.</p>

<p>Blockchain technology has NOTHING to do with A.I. and the whole process is very well documented, opensourced to the public.</p>

<p>Stop the paranoia. Stop believing in things you don&#39;t understand. &quot;Free energy&quot;, &quot;UFO&quot;, &quot;pure A.I.&quot;.</p>

<p>Even the concept of counciousness is probably not understood by you, so just seek for some help, stop smoking weed, exercise. That will make your mind clearer.</p>
