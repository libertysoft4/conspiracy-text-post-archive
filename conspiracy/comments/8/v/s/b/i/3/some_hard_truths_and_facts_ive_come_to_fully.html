        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><ol>
<li>5G causes innumerable negative health effects, most notably glioma (CANCER) of the brain...4G is less powerful, but the same results...damage occurs on a cellular and DNA level....it is illegal for many US counties to try and ban/stop/delay 5G installation....it is a weapon of mass destruction and a slow death planned the citizens of this country</li>
<li>Anthony Bourdain was murdered...I don&#39;t think any of us need evidence for this...you can FEEL the truth in your sunken heart if you have one. His tweet one month before about HRC agents....Additionally, Seth Rich and Mila de Meir were murdered by affiliates of the US Government...we need to protect Julian Assange as WikiLeaks mission will forever remain crucial for the future of humanity amidst governments. The sexual misconduct is very possibly a smear campaign, I have not looked into it...I would not be surprised if Jim Carrey &#39;killed himself&#39; next.</li>
<li>Building 7 did not come down from fires, a plane did not hit the Pentagon, airborne terrorist training drills were happening the same day(WTF!)...planes were auto-piloted with equipment on fuelselage, micro-thermite...it&#39;s so glaringly obvious..and I am sorry if you do not comprehend this.</li>
<li>The Pyramids were not built as tombs...there are multiple pyramids all over the Earth, all placed in very strategic locations, based off of a sine wave. <a href="http://www.human-resonance.org/phi.html">http://www.human-resonance.org/phi.html</a> I want to discuss this further.</li>
<li>GMOs, Glyphosate, food colorings, &#39;sucralose&#39;, nitrites, bleached wheat flour, all preservatives, (BHT in your Cinnamon Toast Crunch) all cause cancer. Vaccines are equally asdangerous and contain aluminum.</li>
<li>&#39;Flouride&#39; is not what is added to water. It is sodium flourosilicic acid, which neutralizes into sodium flourosilicate....basically nothing on wikipedia about it...<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sodium_fluorosilicate">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sodium_fluorosilicate</a> .... heres the MSDS sheet...<a href="http://www.fluoridealert.org/wp-content/pesticides/msds/sodium.fluorosilicate.solvay.pdf">http://www.fluoridealert.org/wp-content/pesticides/msds/sodium.fluorosilicate.solvay.pdf</a> ..... not only does it cause cancer and who knows what else, it accumulates specifically in your brains pineal gland, which receive I believe the 2nd most amount of bloodflow anywhere in your body, and has esoteric Egyptian origins of being known as the Eye of Horus. It is your biological key to doors of non-biological reals. Sodium flouride is in toothpaste, probably not great either,use Neem paste.. ALSO, the magnetic properties of water are something to be read up about...specifically, channeling water parallel to a magnetic fields flux &#39;lines&#39; ...hint: we are 80&amp;#37; water....2nd hint:..the Earth has a electromagnetic field.</li>
<li>JFKs second shot in the Zapruder film is clearly coming from the front, based on how his head whacks backward upon impact...and the obvious brain being blown out the back..if you think the second shot came from Oswald..or even the first for that matter...you are hopeless...at being a physicist, and awakend being.</li>
<li>China went to the moon and landed at 19.5 degrees for a very specific reason. On Earth, we have quite a number of places that are connected to 19.5 degrees. Mauna Loa, the largest shield volcano is at 19.6 degrees north.The Pyramid of the Sun at Teotihuacan is at 19.6 degrees north. (19 degrees 23 minutes N, 99 degrees 10 minutes W) On Mars: the “vast” Olympus Mons shield cone volcano is at 19.5 degrees. On Jupiter: the “red spot” which is an obvious vortex is at 19.5 degrees. On Neptune: in 1986 Voyager II discovered a similar spot at 19.5 degrees north. 19.5 degrees north and south are the latitudes where the apex points of a star tetrahedra within a sphere will contact that sphere’s surface when one apex is positioned at the north or south pole. Read about platonic solids, scalar energy, and gnosticism. ALSO, there is something at the poles of all planets. Agartha, is very possible, and some have made it there.</li>
<li>Electromagnetism is being manipulated as a weapon by all US government agencies for mind control and the planting of suicidal thoughts, combined with relentless GANGSTALKING meant to make political dissidents suicide themselves</li>
<li>Orgone Pyramids and Schumann Resonators can protect against EM poisoning.</li>
<li>I&#39;m still slightly &#39;up in the air&#39; on Chemtrails..but only because you are so programmed into their &#39;conspiracy nut&#39; labeling and supposed implausibility that the mere mention of them will subconsciously discredit this entire post if your aren&#39;t awake yet. Bees are endangered...WTF...</li>
<li>ICE and other agencies and affiliated persons are trafficking children for sex...Podesta emails about &#39;Pizza parties&#39; and the like should deeply disturb everyone..it is pedo code... if you don&#39;t buy it, why the FUCK would these people actually be emailing about pizza parties...is that what we elect these people to do? The HRC Obama pizza parlor story is only ridiculous because the &#39;pizza parlor&#39; was not an actual storefront pizza shop.. it is another misinformation attempt, just like flat Earth....BUT</li>
<li>As to not lose a reader, if you <em>are</em> a hardcore Flat Earth/firmament individual, my best reconciliation is that Earth is a 2D plane when one is subjected to/within its space-time-bending gravitational force. (another misunderstood effect of electro-magnetism) and that when outside of Earth&#39;s magnetic/gravity field, it becomes observable as a 3Dimensional sphere due to gravity/magnetism&#39;s intertwined nature with light. Observing that energy outside of the field from space, I can see that possibly making sense. As for the glass firmament aspect, there is a theory I am starting to enjoy, claiming that ETs &#39;built&#39; (for lack of a better word) a glass dome around the moon, using nuclear-bomb generated heat, combined with guess what? The two most abundant elements of the moon&#39;s surface, silicon and oxygen. &#39;When molten <strong>silicon</strong> dioxide SiO2 is rapidly cooled, it does not crystallize, but solidifies as a glass.&#39; -wikipedia.</li>
<li>Meditation has profound health affects. &#39;spirituality&#39; is a misunderstood label for higher realms of existence involving energies in the non-visible parts of the electromagnetic spectrum and their bio/neuro-electric energetic interactions with our body and mind, respectively.</li>
<li>My favorite personal discovery is that the Royal Cubit, Megalithic Yard, meter, and foot, are all very special in their universal applications in a 2D and 3D dimension(with pi)....and that stems from the fact that 1 RC = .5235 meters....and that <strong>.5235 can be obtained via pi/6 OR pi - phi^2</strong> .... if you take that and start applying it to dimensional relationships within THIS wavenumber cube <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wavenumber">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wavenumber</a>...you may find something sublime.</li>
</ol>

<p>I hope this is a good starting point for inner and eventual outward revolution.  I have a fantastic reading list if youd like more info on any topics.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Cool stuff, I don&#39;t buy all your points, but let me add what I know.</p>

<ol>
<li>5G is puzzling. What&#39;s so bad about 4G? New infrastructure that costs a lot of money (an estimated $200,000,000,000 per year) to roll out without a good reason to do so makes me wonder. Nobody wants it, nobody needs it, but we are getting it anyway. Who is behind this push, why are their priorities backwards, and what kind of secret technology are these towers equipped with? Stingray 2.0? Directed Energy Weapons? An extra thick dose of cancerous microwave radiation? Whyyyyy!</li>
<li>Anthony Bourdain was highly critical towards various elites towards the end of his days. His death by hanging makes no sense, like so many similar cases, the MSM puts out some kind of shameful story to sweep the thing under the rug, like they were doing auto-erotic asphyxiation (is this some epidemic? what a joke), or he was an alcoholic and battled demons until those demons took his life (uh ok...appeal to religion), or how about he was convicted of possession of child pornography (that&#39;s an easy one to make people NOT want to look into a death for foul play). It only makes me question deaths like Chester Bennington (hanged), Chris Cornell (hanged), David Carradine (hanged), Kate Spade (hanged). I&#39;m sorry but that is a pattern for foul play and nothing else at this point. Anthony Bourdain&#39;s girlfriend Asia was one of Harvey Weinstein&#39;s accusers. Harvey hired a company called Black Cube to clean up his mess. They were tracking Asia (and Anthony) as well as Rose McGowan. They got Rose slammed with cocaine charges. What did they do to Anthony?</li>
<li>Donald Rumsfeld, Dick Cheney, George W Bush, Condoleeza Rice, Larry Silverstein, Rudy Guiliani, Zbigniew Breszinski. These men most likely know exactly what happened, yet we&#39;ll never see them in an interrogation room. Ever. Our leadership won&#39;t do it, because it would start civil war once we uncover and verify the truth. Most other first world governments also probably know what happened, but we&#39;re in a New World Order now, so they are all allies despite the &quot;war games&quot; they play, and we the people are their common enemy. Remember the cold war? That was a war on us, not a war between nations. The nations/govs are working together to fuck us.</li>
<li>Telling how there is usually a body of a king inside a pyramid, I&#39;d say they are at least a kind of tomb, but perhaps more than that. I&#39;d say it&#39;s a psychological effect. Let&#39;s make a huge fuckin tomb for this king so that people know he was an important dude, and so that future kings earn the same type of respect from the populace. The Egyptian ones originated from mastabas until Pharaoh Djoser&#39;s assistant decided to build up the mastabas a bit more to form a step pyramid.</li>
</ol>

<p>(more to come)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Wow Jackie.  Never heard that one, I&#39;ve been inclined with the Driver, or multiple shadow people on the Grassy Knoll.  The precision of the shots, throat first, cant talk, then head, it&#39;s a very precise assassination...noone&#39;s just trying to impress Jody Foster.  </p>

<p>Re: the pyramid, the K and Q chamber, are located at specific heights within the pyramid, which, as has been hypothesized, used to contained the Nile running underneath it (running water is an AC current), and slightly beyond my understanding, this AC current resonated upward through the piezoelectric calcite in the pyramids, to create some very powerful energies imparted upon those within these chambers.  I believe the pyramid had the ability to teleport consciousness and possibly human DNA, which <a href="https://phys.org/news/2016-08-dna-naturally-fluoresces.html">https://phys.org/news/2016-08-dna-naturally-fluoresces.html</a> has been shown to emit light.  <em>I believe the starshafts were just that, a direction for light propagation for DNA and possibly consciousness interstellar travel.</em>  I would <strong>highly</strong> recommend Carl Munck&#39;s the Code <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1k3LYQdKTT0">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1k3LYQdKTT0</a> for an indisputable analysis of the placement of many megalithic sites, and would conclude that they all possessed teleportation abilities.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve entertained just about every angle for who the assassins were. I can only go by what evidence is available and what can be speculated from it, so that&#39;s what I&#39;m operating on. Watched the films. Read the books. Sifted through all the autopsy photos and the three commissions. That doesn&#39;t make me an expert by any means but...</p>

<p>I really suggest watching Jackie&#39;s behavior and movements in the limo right when JFK gets shot in the head. Slow it down and zoom it in. The upper right side of his head explodes (temple area above the ear), not the back, which to me would imply the shot came from the left side we cannot see in the Zapruder film. Watch the puff of smoke happen on Jackie&#39;s side of the limo, and notice how the bullet ricochets up into the air. That looks like a point blank gunshot to his left ear.</p>

<p>The film was taken and edited before it reached the public. The limo may have slowed down IRL but edited out in the film by playing with the frame speed, it&#39;s a good observation but hard to say for sure. It&#39;s also curious how JFK is clenching at his throat just after the limo passes behind the signpost. I feel like that part was edited somehow.</p>

<p>The most obvious problem I have is that the autopsy photos/reports do not reflect the visual evidence in the Zapruder film (where the exit wound was), so I lean towards the theory that it was Officer Tippet&#39;s autopsy we got to see, not JFK&#39;s. And this also implies the shooting happened from a different angle, the only angle nobody wants to suggest! Isn&#39;t that interesting :)</p>

<p>The one thing that doesn&#39;t match up with this Jackie theory is that he was also shot in the neck, which I don&#39;t think Jackie did. There are some decent &quot;Jackie Did It&quot; articles on the web you might check out.</p>

<p>I will give the monolith stuff a lot more of my attention since it fascinates me. I also saw a few videos recently where experts visit the pyramids and talk about the water chamber and what it could have been for. These guys were hard science, but completely baffled by the pyramid chambers which suggest something mechanical was at play.</p>

You get dead rulers in <em>later</em> pyramids, in all likelihood because of their connection to spiritual development. The great pyramids didn&#39;t have people in them. It makes sense that structures used to enhance the spiritual qualities of a person would be chosen to inter dead important people after the culture had forgotten their specific function and only remembered the vague concept of what they did. And Egyptian culture did forget, priests guarded the mysteries for centuries. </p>

<p>One time i started studying the religion of Eckcankar, a base off of Christianity , so Eck, focuses on meditation and becoming a co worker of God, we’ll one time i meditated , and during that meditation, you’re supposed to chant Hu(word of God) , so i did, and eventually my eyes started fluttering and going crazy as if i were in REM sleep, anyways fast forward, i go to sleep, that night i had a dream about Phi, and all i remember is that It felt like God was sending me information, ..... almost as if Phi was the answer to the universe .

    <div class="md"><p>Just to finish up, I also have a theory on Jesus being an ascended master, with full Tibetan lightbody, basically a bio-antenna capable of receiving cosmic energies/frequencies/ions due to his superconductive, magnetically aligned physiology he learned through Moses. These energies excited his bodies electrons into higher orbital states, which then over time, through law of conservation of energy, return to normal orbital energies via emitting a photon (light) / EM radiation...this is how lightbodies work I believe. Also have a theory about Moses&#39; staff being an antenna, the same length as the Ark, that doubled as a dowsing rod, and a tuning fork, capable of finding a river underneath a rock in the desert, and capable of splitting this rock with the tuning fork to provide water for his followers. Also believe the parting of the Red Sea, being one of the saltiest bodies of water in the world, is incredibly electro-conductive, and could respond to certain frequency input for the purposes of parting it. Still off my meds.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Your gnostic stuff sounds a bit too “new-age” imho.  Try just the idea that the entire Old Testament is about Satan, Yahweh was the Christian Satan and the snake in the garden was God (Jesus’s dad)’s first attempt to save man.  </p>

<p>You see even though Satan created man (check the passage about “if man eats the fruit he shall be like <strong>us</strong> and know good from evil” Satan was talking to other angels) but despite being Satan’s creation, because Satan was an angel created by God, he could not help but pass the divine “spark” unto man.</p>

<p>Satan wanted man to remain as a beast in the garden, not knowing good from evil, (the ultimate sin is ignorance) and be blinded by the false paradise that the evil always wish for man to inhabit (hmmm kinda like VR, video games, porn and other media to escape reality today).</p>

<p>The serpent was a messenger of God, sent to save man from Satan’s false paradise by giving him the <em>knowledge</em> of good and evil, thus granting him the ability to be saved.  Man was cast out, but this was a reprieve not a punishment.</p>

<p>The entire Old Testament is the book of Satan’s will and law, Jesus was the savior and the light to once again intervene for God and give man the chance to transcend their innate sin (the part inherited <em>by being created by Satan, not from eating the fruit!</em>)</p>

<p>If one is a Christian, I advise they rip out from the Bible <em>all of the red text, the actual words of Jesus</em> and throw the rest in the garbage or put on a shelf with history books for only the one part is needed for salvation, the rest will only lead one astray.</p>

<p>All the evidence is there in the Old Testament, Hod does not toy with people or demand blood sacrifice, that is not the one who sought to save man from himself and Satan.  That is the enemy and the one who would keep man enslaved. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You still have nothing constructive to say. </p>

<p>That&#39;s the issue with a lot of you. You think you&#39;re being a &#39;free thinker&#39; because you watched a documentary or two and read some article about the government putting estrogen in the air or some shit and completely leave the realm of feasibility into your own little bubble where everyone is wrong because they&#39;re a shill. In reality, you&#39;re doing the same thing you accuse everyone else of doing. You&#39;re just a sheep in the herd gobbling up whatever new conspiracy is fed to you instead of considering any sort of actual facts. Everyone else is wrong because of their bias and refusal to have an open mind, except you fail to realize that, by using that as your exclusive argument, you&#39;re being a complete hypocrite. </p>

<p>The only thing on your list I would personally revise, at least that I would revise with 100% certainty. Of course we need evidence, you can&#39;t just go around making assumptions that coincidences are necessarily proof and leap over the need for evidence.</p>

<a href="https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=2fS9ixfQ_no">https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=2fS9ixfQ_no</a></p>

<p>Description:<br/>
The Revelation Of The Pyramids takes an indepth look into one of the seven wonders of the world, the Great Pyramids of Egypt. Mystery has surrounded these fascinating structures for centuries with theories varying from the scientific to the bizarre.
However with over many years of indepth research taking in the world’s oldest, most enigmatic and beautiful sites from China to Peru, from Egypt to Mexico, a team of independent researchers has, at last, managed first to understand and then to reveal what lies behind this greatest of archaeological mysteries: a message of paramount importance for all mankind, through time and space.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>EDIT:</p>

<p>Just to finish up since I&#39;m so CRAZY, also have a theory on Jesus being an ascended master, with full Tibetan lightbody, basically a bio-antenna capable of receiving cosmic energies/frequencies/ions due to his superconductive, magnetically aligned physiology he learned through Moses.  These energies excited his bodies electrons into higher orbital states, which then over time, through law of conservation of energy, return to normal orbital energies via emitting a photon (light) / EM radiation...this is how lightbodies work I believe.  Also have a theory about Moses&#39; staff being an antenna, the same length as the Ark, that doubled as a dowsing rod, and a tuning fork, capable of finding a river underneath a rock in the desert, and capable of splitting this rock with the tuning fork to provide water for his followers.  Also believe the parting of the Red Sea, being one of the saltiest bodies of water in the world, is incredibly electro-conductive, and could respond to certain frequency input for the purposes of parting it. Still off my meds.</p>
