        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>As many of you may know, people have been experiencing the Mandela affect, which is when a large group of people remembering something a certain way that isn’t how it is now. Many people have remembered the “Berenstain Bears” to be spelt “Berenstein Bears,” along with “Wite Out” spelt as “White Out.” A theory claims that there has been a collision with our universe and an alternate universe and changed parts of our reality. People started noticing changes to things that they swore were different for a few months, maybe longer. The way this links to the sun vanishing is because of a twitter account: @TheSunVanished which shows what seems to be an alternate reality that is somehow showing in our reality about how the sun (and everything else outside of earth) has vanished. I think that this is proof to alternate realities being real and that we are just fortunate that not everything has gone the same as the sun-less Earth. The twitter account shows his experiences in his lightless Armageddon world, riots and break-ins are plentiful in the beginning of his story while it slowly gets darker and darker. He has had the aid of two people, Danyon and Tucker. In his recent posts, there was an intruder or intruders looking for him. His last post showed him getting in a car with his friend Danyon, but we haven’t heard since. Hopefully the sun comes up tomorrow.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m definitely affected by the ME. Probably more so, than others. I remember most of all of them. I have my theories on what it is, but, what I really would like to know, is... how many people with this, suffered very traumatic events in their lives or NDE&#39;s on or around the time of 2010-2012? </p>

<p>I can understand why some people will refrain from answering, but, I&#39;ll go out on a limb (in honesty and transparency)... and admit, that I did. I think there might be a connection with this, along with the ending of the Mayan Calendar - Great Awakening/Unveiling.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hey, thanks for answering honestly and I&#39;m truly sorry to hear you were at that low point, as well :(. I was there, too, friend. It was a very dark time in my life, where I figuratively &quot;killed&quot; the old me. Literally in all sense of the meaning. </p>

<p>I&#39;ve talked about this before, but, never really got that discussion I was seeking (this was years ago, though - times are a changing). I really do think there might be a connection to this. I&#39;ve been pondering this for years. </p>

Mona Lisa and the Thinker switched back  and forth a couple times.  The ones that are most &quot;confirmable&quot; for me are several out of the Bible.  I was pretty hardcore fundamentalist in my youth, lots of Bible study, KJV only, and there are parts that I studied fairly in-depth that got totally wiped out by ME.  Wineskins, lion laying with the lamb, and Moses never had friggin horns.  That last one had some strange implications...</p>

<p>Once I went through this stuff, topics like reincarnation, gnosticism, ancient ruling families, and others were much more relevant and even compelling.</p>

Human brains do not encode information in a precise format, so it is understandable that people would often misremember certain minor details like this, even en masse.
