<p><a href="http://nymag.com/nymetro/news/people/n_7912/">http://nymag.com/nymetro/news/people/n_7912/</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Epstein likes to tell people that he&#39;s a loner, a man who&#39;s never touched alcohol or drugs, and one whose nightlife is far from energetic. And yet if you talk to Donald Trump, a different Epstein emerges. &quot;I&#39;ve known Jeff for fifteen years. Terrific guy,&#39;&#39; Trump booms from a speakerphone. &quot;He&#39;s a lot of fun to be with. It is even said that he likes beautiful women as much as I do, and many of them are on the younger side. No doubt about it -- Jeffrey enjoys his social life.&quot; </p>

<p>It&#39;s neither, genius, because it&#39;s not a lie. He&#39;s said creepy shit about his daughter. Completely, undeniably an easily verifiable fact.</p>

<p>I will change it from

<p>to </p>

<p><em>He gushed with Howard Stern over how beautiful she is and then agreed with him that she is &quot;a piece of ass.&quot;</em></p>

<p>Is that okay? Can you refute anything about that? Is it any less creepy when paired with the other things he&#39;s definitely said about her? We can argue about a misplaced word or two, but facts are facts and context is context, and my misplaced word or two doesn&#39;t alter the facts, so I&#39;ll repeat the most important one again: </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You just proved my point. You made this mistake precisely because people have repeated that <strong>lie</strong> over and over. That is intentional. Whoever is pushing this propaganda wants people like you to remember something that literally didn&#39;t happen. It&#39;s brainwashing.  </p>

<p>Putting the literal words aside, you still haven&#39;t interpreted that interaction in a reasonable way. Howard Stern asked if <em>he</em> could call her a piece of ass, not if Trump thinks of her that way. Guess what? When you&#39;re on Howard Stern&#39;s show, you smile and nod when he says crass stuff because that&#39;s his whole schtick. We shouldn&#39;t even need to have this conversation. It&#39;s common sense.  </p>

<p>There&#39;s nothing wrong with a father calling his daughter beautiful. That&#39;s how you <em>avoid</em> daddy issues. They can talk like this and make jokes <em>because</em> they are so secure in their healthy father-daughter relationship. Donald Trump didn&#39;t even understand that people would think twice about his jokes because the idea that they would be taken seriously was completely absurd to him. The attacks say more about the people making them than they do about Donald Trump. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>“After I met Ivanka and praised her to her father, he said, ‘Yeah, she&#39;s really something, and what a beauty, that one. If I weren&#39;t happily married and, ya know, her father . . .’” </p>

<p>According to several studio witnesses, Mr Trump replied that he kisses Ivanka “with every chance [he] gets”. The comment was apparently edited out of the final cut of the show when it went to air. </p>

<p>When <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/DonaldTrump">Donald Trump</a> was watching his 16-year-old daughter Ivanka host the 1997 Miss Teen USA pageant, he turned to the then-Miss Universe and asked: “Don’t you think my daughter’s hot? She’s hot, right?” </p>

<p>Mr Trump replies in the affirmative when host Howard Stern asks him if he can call Ivanka &quot;a piece of ass”.  </p>

<p>Trump: “My daughter is beautiful, Ivanka.&quot;  </p>

<p>Stern: “By the way, your daughter…”  </p>

<p>Trump: “ - she’s beautiful&quot;  </p>

<p>Stern: “Can I say this? A piece of ass.”  </p>

<p>Trump: “Yeah.”</p>

<p>When asked how he would react if Ivanka, a former teen model, posed for Playboy, Trump replied, &quot;It would be really disappointing — not really — but it would depend on what&#39;s inside the magazine.&quot;  </p>

<p>He added: &quot;I don&#39;t think Ivanka would do that, although she does have a very nice figure. I&#39;ve said if Ivanka weren&#39;t my daughter, perhaps I&#39;d be dating her.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Trump is (was) a business man. He was cordial to everyone even the Clintons. Epstein and Trump both resided in south Florida. Trump also uses a lot of hyperbole &quot;terrific guy&quot; when speaking, be it of others or of things.</p>

<p>Trump may be a lot of things but he certainly is not a pedophilia nor did he need someone to help get him laid. It&#39;s ludicrous.</p>

<p>The Clinton&#39;s on the other hand (both of them) liked others getting them their prey. That&#39;s how TRUE pedophiles act. Like a King/Queen on a throne---being served.  That however is NOT Trump.

    <div class="md"><p>See, everyone, this is how you spot someone who is either a liar or they are under deception. They deny evidence and facts with hyperbole using exaggerated words like &quot;certainly&quot;, &quot;ludicrous&quot;, &quot;phony&quot;. Then they project their own inner motives onto you, &quot;Just stop the hate!!!&quot; with an almost desperate tone about them. Then here comes the deflection + projection onto their perceived enemy which is just their scapegoat for all of their own faults, negative feelings and misdeeds. They attribute all of that stuff to outside people our groups because they can&#39;t possibly accept these things in themselves. See how sure he is that how that &quot;is NOT how Trump rolls!!!!&quot; Those that scream the loudest. Isn;t that something you guys like to say over on the Q board? Funny how you never apply that logic to Trump. &quot;NO COLLUSION! (except by the democrats&quot; , WITCHUNT!&quot;, &quot;NO PUPPET! NO PUPPET! YOU&#39;RE THE PUPPET!&quot;</p>

<p>I like how he finishes it by informing me of how intelligent people see things and they just so happen to agree with him. And how only hateful small minded democrats won&#39;t see it this way, yet he claims he&#39;s not a conservative (while not telling us what he does believe) either so that means he&#39;s better than both of them. The way he framed this last part tells me that he lives in a black and white world. Right vs Left. Republican vs Democrat. Obama vs Trump. Democrats are the &quot;other&quot; in his head. They are the enemy. So since I am against Trump, something he is strongly for, that means I must be the enemy and that enemy is democrats. He already knows my intelligence and my entire belief system simply because I don&#39;t support Trump. There is only one word for people like this. Delusional.</p>

He did have underage girls but he also entertained legitimate people and hosted legitimate party&#39;s too.</p>
