Our taxes only go to pay off the debt incurred from the FED (which is a scam - it&#39;s being laundered to the City of London - Switzerland - Vatican).

    <div class="md"><p>How about this for a crazy idea: allow citizens to dictate (maybe twice a year?) where a percentage of their income taxes are spent.</p>

<p>I have often thought about what might happen should say 2 or 3 whole states worth of people withheld their federal income tax. I think it could ultimately lead to the dissolution of the US because the feds would eventually turn to violence to collect up. Issues with money/finances are the surest way to divide people.</p>

<p>it’s the people’s money, they should decide what to fund based on what’s important to them. i bet if that happened there’d be a lot less people supporting these endless wars instead of the government deciding that’s what we should spend our money on, since they’re the ones making the mistakes. </p>
