        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>The EU politicians are either asleep at the wheel or under the control of dark forces, this sweeping new legislation will be used to censor to Internet, effectively hand-cuffing the power of the people in their fight against the corrupt elite and psychopath-controlled corporations.</p>

<p>The plan is undemocratic, anyone based over in Europe should <a href="http://www.europarl.europa.eu/unitedkingdom/en/your-meps/uk_meps.html">write to their MEPs</a> before the vote on the 5th July and explain to them on why it needs to be stopped.</p>

<p>Some more details below:-</p>

<p>&#39;Disastrous&#39; copyright bill vote approved
<a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-44546620">https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-44546620</a></p>

<p>&quot;A committee of MEPs has voted to accept major changes to European copyright law, which experts say could change the nature of the internet.</p>

<p>They voted to approve the controversial Article 13, which critics warn could put an end to memes, remixes and other user-generated content.</p>

<p>Article 11, requiring online platforms to pay publishers a fee if they link to their news content, was also approved.</p>

<p>One organisation opposed to the changes called it a &quot;dark day&quot;.</p>

<p>The European Parliament&#39;s Committee on Legal Affairs voted by 15 votes to 10 to adopt Article 13 and by 13 votes to 12 to adopt Article 11.</p>

<p>It will now go to the wider European Parliament to vote on in July.&quot;</p>

<p>The EU is killing our democratic spaces using copyright as a Trojan horse 
<a href="https://www.opendemocracy.net/can-europe-make-it/renata-avila-joren-de-wachter-christoph-schneider/eu-is-killing-our-democratic-sp">https://www.opendemocracy.net/can-europe-make-it/renata-avila-joren-de-wachter-christoph-schneider/eu-is-killing-our-democratic-sp</a></p>

<p>&quot;The EU has recently embarked on a new mission: controlling the Internet through the monopoly of copyright. This attempt to reform and control the Internet has not received half the attention it deserves.</p>

<p>As Julia Reda, MEP for the Pirate Party, has explained, the current project of EU legislation would impose automatic filters that control ANY content that anyone wants to upload. The reason would be the protection of copyright, a monopoly right that primarily benefits large media behemoths, without any possibility of advance verification. </p>

<p>You read that right: the EU wants to put in place a global censorship machine, on the basis of unverifiable monopoly rights, mostly held by large media corporations.&quot;</p>

<p>EU&#39;s Copyright Reform Proposal
<a href="http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/events/eus-copyright-reform-proposal-article-13">http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/events/eus-copyright-reform-proposal-article-13</a></p>

<p>&quot;Article 11 would require extra copyrights for news or media outlets, requiring anyone who would like to link to a news site must first get a license from the publisher. Julia Reda writes, &quot;The automatic link previews social networks generate when users share links (showing the article headline, a thumbnail picture and a short excerpt) would require a license, as well as anyone analysing news content on the web like news aggregators, media monitoring services and fact checking services.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Article 13 requires that internet platforms that rely on hosting large amounts of user-uploaded data must monitor that content. Additionally, they must moderate the content to identify copyright infringement. The proposal could limit freedom of expression and harm independent creators.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;On June 20th, the European Parliament Committee on Legal Affairs voted yes to on articles 11 and 13 of the referendum. Many criticized the vote stating that it &quot;threatened the openness of the internet and made it less free.&quot; However, despite the vote, the vote does not put the rules into law, but rather only secures European Parliament&#39;s position on the issue, before moving the process to the final stages.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Please research this on your own.</p>

<p>Article 13 addresses the case that people who produce memes don&#39;t get anything for their effort.</p>

<p>Use case: John Smith makes a &quot;Y U NO meme&quot;. A website (9gag, Reddit etc.) take that meme and post it. The website gets traffic and shows ads to that traffic, earning money. John Smith gets 0%. Website gets 100%.</p>

<p>Intention: John Smith can now ask the website, &quot;I want 50% of money earned from traffic generated by my meme&quot;. Website refuses. John Smith complains to EU authorities. Website gets fined and John Smith gets his money. If website agrees, John Smith can ask for a <em>filter</em> so the meme isn&#39;t posted by users, only by the website.</p>

<p>Result: Shitty sites that steal content get struck down. Sites that fairly pay content creators get all the traffic.</p>

in place complaints and redress mechanisms that are available to users in case of disputes over the application of the measures&quot;. This means Google is now obliged to put proper anti-copyright claim mechanisms on Youtube, rather than just having a series of automated emails.</p>

They aren&#39;t supposed to be monetized like cartoons, and by their very nature, probably infringe on another&#39;s copyrighted work (the old Dat Boi meme is a perfect case study for Article 13).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>How do you know that? Who are the gatekeepers of what is copyrighted and should be removed/censored? Who decides? How in the fuck are they supposed to enforce this?</p>

<p>Look at what happened to YouTube, they started using algorithms to block, remove or downright censor specific content. What happened? A lot of channels and content that wasn&#39;t warranted for being taken down did, this is still happening. </p>

<p>How are they going to be 100% sure of the origin of the meme/content? People have used systems like this for abuse before, especially in the case of YouTube, where people and corporations have reported channels for copyright strikes when it is clearly within fair use. </p>

<p>Whether this censorship will be intentional or not, it will be happening. And this is not just for memes, governments have used laws like this to censor those with opinions they don&#39;t like. I can&#39;t for the life of me understand how you connect this Article to the freedom of speech, it is in my opinion the opposite. </p>

<p>If the jury had seen Tommy&#39;s Facebook live the defendants for the major case in question would&#39;ve had the opportunity to apply for a re-trial on the grounds that the jury could be biased.</p>

<p>While I very much doubt it would result in the defendants walking away, it would give them more time to prepare thselves, knowing the evidence against them, and forcing witnesses and victims to give evidence all over again. Also would&#39;ve cost alot of taxpayer money</p>

<p>Worth noting: </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Some of our countries will not give up as they expected, the case being, Poland, Hungary Slovakia and Czech Republic. Those are the one who strongly are against the command of the liberal German agenda, and &quot;unexpectedly&quot; also with fast growing economies, plus they do not use euro (apart from Slovakia that is the weakest in the group exactly because of that) they command their economy and are thriving. But I can say that Paris is now Africa/middle east. Just go and visit, don&#39;t take my word. Go to Berlin, you will be in Turkey. Seriously, just go and see, it&#39;s depressing. By the way, I love the foreign communities that work and adapt and thrive. The problem is that 90% of them close themselves in ghettos and just create trouble. Like Muslims in UK. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You absolutely have no idea who are you talking with. But I will enlighten you. 80% of my best friends are from middle east. Others are simply from Muslim countries (Marroco as example) and I have been in middle east for months in a row and I am writing this from a moderate Muslim country that I seriously respect. Although, everyone from Muslim countries keeps telling ME that Europe has no idea of what human garbage they are importing. My Muslim friends run away from those people and now, we are welcoming them in Europe. One of my friends is think to move back to middle east because it&#39;s safer than London! The people that he run away from, keep pouring in Europe, people are blind, and, I AM SEEING FAKE NEWS! Any person living in middle east with a certain level of education is laughing at the border control of Europe and they can&#39;t understand why we let all of this radicals, prisoners and murders in! I strongly advise you to make that tour and come here and comment again. </p>

<p>in my experience, tho, and at least where I live uneducated working class typically voted left because &quot;they care for the working class, bro, not like the conservative richs&quot; and educated people voted right because it usually was better for the economy at the bussines level.</p>

<p>It seems to me, only these past few decades the left has abandoned the &quot;working class&quot;  piece and they went full social justice, minority mode, so obviously poor working class people are getting assblasted and they are opening their eyes while  privileged college pseudointellectuals had gone the other way just to feel they are morally superior.</p>

<p>that said, i have no idea what to do about this because, well, the institutions doing this have no method for the general public to contact them and their connection to the large corporations demanding it are invisible </p>

<p>the justiication for it is non-existent, but they don&#39;t have to justify it as the system is anti-democratic </p>

<p>i am not sure the e.u. would have been implemented if it were outright known and said clearly that they are making an anti-democratic institution filled with suit wearing types with names no one has ever heard of</p>
