We&#39;ve got full grown adults who have the intuition, pattern recognition and bullshit radar of a three-year-old.<br/>
I&#39;m not saying the researchers on this sub can always accurately identify every deception and hidden truth, but at least we have the ability to recognize the incredibly blatant B.S. of things like 9/11, JFK, OKC, &quot;ISIS&quot; and the staged shootings.<br/>
What is causing so many other people (such as the TMOR crowd and the Michael Shermer disciples) to reach adulthood without this ability?<br/>
Help me brainstorm possible causes.</p>

<p>A better explanation would be that the fear of being ostracized by social groups causes people to uncritically accept, adopt, and even promote the groups&#39; beliefs even when they might normally conflict with personal beliefs and reason. </p>

<p>Many of our stories that we watch are bait and switch things.  Some watch what is in front of them  and are surprised at the reveal.  Others are looking for the reveal, but do not see what is in front of them. Others look between to see the real meaning. The last group sees the whole picture.  Which one are you?</p>

<p>So in essence: Film, TV, Youtube(Modern TV) have shaped us into what we are. Now we get to things like internet and news media, Reddit, Buzzfeed, CNN, Fox-news, MSNBC, USA-Today. You get snippets of data (McNews) and a lot of it.  A shotgun barrage of data.  Only a few pellets stick. And you are so numb from the Mass data that looking between the lines is nearly impossible.</p>

<p>Simple. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree with point 1. There are varying degrees of probability to these theories. Read OP&#39;s post, he does not acknowledge that point. To him, these theories are 100% true and anyone who doesn&#39;t agree they are 100% true are apparently stupid sheep that can&#39;t think for themselves.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Conversely, if they want you to believe something that is false, they need only give the impression that hard evidence has been presented</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is where you lose me. Who is &#39;they&#39;? You&#39;re going on some unnecessary tangent here. I&#39;m not talking about scientific studies and academia, all I said was there is no hard evidence. The fact you don&#39;t trust scientists has nothing to do with the fact that there&#39;s no tangible evidence for these theories. So by all means keep an open mind about the possibility these theories are true, but no reasonable person would be 100% certain they are like OP.</p>

<p>It&#39;s interesting, I think psychopaths in power would prefer people like you, who are distrustful of everything in the world and open to accepting a version of reality that are not backed up with real world evidence.</p>

<li>Whats the point? They can&#39;t stop it. What good does it do to constantly worry about things you can&#39;t control. Most people have families and children to worry about and don&#39;t have time to delve in to all this stuff. They have full time jobs they need to work at so they can pay off their student load debts, mortgages and car loans. They have pre programmed and controlled view points that they plug into that feed them what they should think without even realizing it because they&#39;re too busy and distracted to really pay attention and use their brains.

    <div class="md"><p>for real though, the fact that more and more people have the ability to have things known around the world within minutes, peoples access to platforms to do what they want, peoples ability to record themselves saying what ever they want, before people only believed what they were told mostly, for one thing people didn&#39;t really have too much of a reason to not believe it, they had no reason to in their eyes this is the usa we have free speech and all of that. People now have access to say something and basically anyone in the world can see it say musicians like Post Malone can blow up in one night. we also live in a time that most everyone is just caught up in identity politics, being ouragged,and no one is getting along. How do people act on oh you think different then me now i am going to beat you up or they shouldn&#39;t exist anymore telling them to kill themselves or people getting blown up because of what religion they are. That is some super childish behavior that people would not want being said to them and most of the time doesn&#39;t mean what is being said or that would never be done outside of on worldstar. For real people are fucked up and they think that it is a fun game to screw with people&#39;s minds also annoy the crap out of you and make you go crazy it&#39;s a fun game for some unknown reason they just like to bother you. The lack of education, people being bored, the need to feel important or get likes, views, subs, then you have the ones who get people fired and feel super proud the ended someones career for something taken out of context or by mistake. its a fun game to people</p>
