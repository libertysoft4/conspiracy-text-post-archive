    <div class="md"><p>Super interesting, saved for attempting at another time.</p>

<p>A question for OP; how do drugs (recreational or pharmaceutical) affect the chakras and this healing process? Are you aware of a patient&#39;s medications/substance use before the healing, or does it become apparent during the session? </p>

<p>I have started researching kundalini yoga and (as someone who suffers from polysubstance abuse) was dismayed to read that substance use heavily impacts our connection to spiritual energy.  I was curious if you had seen any manifestations of this</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thank you for your question; this impacts a lot of people.   I will tell you about my personal experience with the matter and then give you a much more seasoned perspective than mine. </p>

<p>I am a substance abuser. It has both helped and hurt me. 
I absolutely  love mixing alcohol and marijuana because when I do,  the veil between the realm of physical and non-physical becomes thin and I begin to channel very effectively.  I can ask a question and,  before I even finish my sentence,  the answers are flowing into my mind with much enthusiasm. My guides&#39; excitement that I am &quot;hearing&quot; them clearly is almost palpable... and that&#39;s what made my last serious channelling session with them so startling.  I got myself to the &quot;window of influence&quot;where I know connection happens very easily.  I connected and started asking questions and one of the first things they said to me was, <strong>&quot;you&#39;ve got to stop this&quot;</strong>.</p>

<p>They then made it absolutely clear to me that what I was doing (using drugs as a tool to connect with them) was causing far more problems than it was solving and if I continued on my course,  they would start withdrawing their assistance because I was making it clear to them that the drugs were more important to me than growing in my understanding.   They explained that I would be far more effective in conversing with them in the future if I can learn to navigate myself to that &quot;space&quot; where we can communicate clearly without  chemical assistance.  They showed me 2 possible futures which I could choose from. One in which I continued use but became distanced from those on the other side trying to help me,  which led to a life of cynicism and ultimately,  my slipping into an alternative probability in which I was dead in the next 15 years.  The other probability they showed me was one in which I eschewed the chemical assistance and focused on reaching them naturally,  building upon a solid foundation and eventually arriving at a point where I can &quot;hear&quot; what they are saying to me all the time without having get blasted. This probability led to me staying on this Earth for at least another 45 years.  They then gave me a bit of &quot;tough love&quot; and explained that if I insist on the drugs,  they would withdraw their assistance because I was being very disrespectful of them.  They shared with me an emotional sensation of them being &quot;let-down&quot; over and over again by someone that is not being considerate of their time and efforts, making it clear that if I&#39;d rather get intoxicated than truly learn what they are offering,  they have better students to teach and I would not be getting their attention any longer.  They also pointed out, with love but a certain firmness,  that people are manifested here in this world for a reason and if I squander my time here as opposed to making a difference in people&#39;s lives that my purpose here was null and they had no reason to &quot;keep&quot; me in this reality... because I was just taking up space. </p>

<p>Serious wake-up call.  </p>

<p>I&#39;ll share some of Barbara Brennan&#39;s perspective concerning the effect of drugs on our auras. She sees these things clearly, I can only &quot;feel&quot; it in a much more disconnected way which doesn&#39;t lead to much quantification of things.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Drugs affect the aura a great deal. I have seen dark energy forms in the liver left from drugs taken for various previous diseases. Hepatitis leaves an orange yellow color in the liver years after the disease is supposedly cured. I have seen the radiopaque dye used to observe the spine that was injected into the spinal column to diagnose injury ten years after injection although it is supposed to be cleared by the body in a month or two. Chemotherapy clogs the whole auric field, but especially the liver, with greenish-brown mucus-like energy. Radiation therapy frays the structured layers of the auric field like a burned nylon stocking. Surgery causes scars in the first layer of the field and sometimes all the way to the seventh layer.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Hands of Light</strong> by Barbara Brennan pg. 142-143</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Drugs like LSD, marijuana, cocaine and alcohol are detrimental to the brilliant, healthy colors of the aura and create etheric mucus, as does disease... every [my client] would snort cocaine on Saturday night, at his Tuesday afternoon session he would have a lot of gray, sticky etheric mucus on the right side of his face and head, while the left side would remain relatively clear. I asked him if he used one nostril more than the other he thought not. My repeated confrontations - I can tell whenever he did it- and a graphic description of his &quot;etheric snot&quot; helped him to stop this habit.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Interesting how marijuana and alcohol aided you in channelling at all (maybe not cannabis, anecdotally I&#39;ve heard a lot of people tell me they can mediatate while being high, and I&#39;ve considered the idea that the introduction of non endocannabinoids has interesting effects on meditation or connectivity), but alcohol I&#39;m surprised about, considering it&#39;s CNS depressant that mostly affects GABA receptors (which deals with (in short) fear/anxiety and nervous system control). One would think that nervous system supression would hinder one&#39;s attempts at connectivity. Same with other sedatives, like benzodiazapines.</p>

<p>Was that the extent of Brennan&#39;s writing on the subject? I could understand cocaine as a substance that damage&#39;s one aura, seeing as it fucks up our neural reward pathways and is physiologically harmful, but I&#39;d be interested in if she comments more on other drugs. </p>

<p>I think if you asked a psychedelic drug user if their experiences have aided them spiritually or helped them reach a level of connectivity, they would answer yes. I&#39;m surprised how LSD (and presumably psilocybin, DMT, and ayuhuasca) was lumped in by Brennan with cocaine and alcohol, especially when these drugs are difficult to abuse, physiologically harmless, and many users find themselves reaching higher levels of introspection (or even other beings!).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>On page 261 of the same book, Brennan has this to say about a client who had taken ecstacy and benefitted greatly from it (the first she had ever seen )</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Since my observations had always shown psychotropic drugs to have a negative effect on the aura I asked Heyoan [her spiritual Guide] about it. He said, &quot;that depends on who takes it and what their field configuration is at the time of taking it. Since David&#39;s 6th chakra was clogged and it was time for him to work on opening it, the drug had a strong effect. But if the individual involved needed to focus on a different chakra the effect would most likely be negative.&quot;</p>

<p>Drugs can be transformative substances. That is their purpose. They do not cure the disease they assist the individual to cure himself.</p>

<p>&quot;The precise substance in the precise amount at the precise time assist the individual to transform himself,&quot; says Heyoan.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It seems like it&#39;s a gamble.  I&#39;ve done plenty of different drugs in my youth, but,  have most likely never done them &quot;at the proper time and the proper dose&quot;.   I will agree that their use did make me far more open-minded as far as entertaining non-mainstream ideas and am extremely grateful for that. I might have grown up into some sort of Bill O&#39;Reilly-esque prick if I&#39;d never started smoking pot,  which seemed to open up my ability for empathy;  before starting smoking,  I had much difficulty seeing things from other perspectives.  Keep in mind that Barbara&#39;s focus is the health of her client&#39;s physical body.  </p>

<p>While something may damage us physically,  it might set us free mentally.  I&#39;ll never regret the chemical exploration I did because it sure did teach me a lot.</p>

<p>This morning,  I was thinking about what you said and suddenly realized it might have something to do with my Ginger Genes. Anesthesiologists in the medical and dental community know that redheads need more anesthesia to be &quot;put under&quot;.  When I was under the age of 2, I fell from a few feet up and bit my tongue so badly it needed stitches;  I was bleeding out.  The doctors assured my parents they would knock me out and stitch me up... They couldn&#39;t put me under, though.  They got to a point where they told my parents;  &quot;we&#39;ve already given him more sedative than we&#39;re supposed to for his weight.  If we give him any more,  it could kill him&quot;.  They ended up tying me to a papoose board and stitching up my tongue while someone kept it pulled out of my mouth with a pair of forceps,  me screaming my ass off the whole time according to my mother.  I don&#39;t remember any of this. </p>

<p>As an adult,  I&#39;d eagerly drink a pint of vodka before going out to do serious labor in the yard.   It energized me and made me capable of doing much more work for a much longer time. As far as I know,  that isn&#39;t the usual response to alcohol for most people. Marijuana glues most people to the couch;  I use it before working hard labor like most people use coffee.   </p>

<p>On that note... Caffeine is not a good thing in my system.  1/2 a cup of coffee is way to much and makes me feel insanely anxious and out of control.  It is possible that I thrived on depressants because they dropped me down into a more productive and stable state than my usual mind-racing urgency which is not very connected nor healthy. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I wonder that as well. I have a feeling mental sciences and energy flow are what he&#39;s talking about.  Psychology is still hardly understood, but those who do understand it (propagandists, politicians, media) have immense control over the physical world through non physical means.  </p>

<p>I have a feeling that the era about which he speaks has already begun, and that it&#39;s being used for the invested interests of the elite few.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Amazing write-up! I just read the whole thing and was excited to try it on my wife. She was all for it, so I reviewed the steps one last time and went for it.</p>

<p>Heres my report:</p>

<p>By far the craziest part for me were the two grounding portions. At the start when I touched her feet I felt somewhat chaotic energy, but then everything sort of harmonized and it felt like my whole body was rocking back and forth and that transferred to her. During the throat chakras and above I felt a lot of cool sensations on my hands, then at 19 lots of warmth around the top of her head and coolness on my left hand. At the final grounding right when I touched her feet it was crazy. Felt like tons of energy flowing through me, goosebumps, shivers, and a fluttery feeling all through my body. It lasted about 15 seconds then it was done. </p>

<p>I had no idea what to expect from her after, but right away she excitedly told me about all the cool sensations when I got to her chakras. She said it felt like was touching her when I was hovering abover her 2nd and 3rd chakra, then reported the same hot/cold sensation at her 5th and above. She didn&#39;t feel anything like I did at the grounding portions though, which I thought was interesting. Reported lots of sensation around her forehead afterward.</p>

<p>So there you have it. I absolutely want to try this again after it sort of settles in a bit. She&#39;s reading now so she can try it out on me. Thanks for the effort you put into your post!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Out of curiosity, does this relate at all to the fact that we can “feel” when something is held between our eyes?</p>

<p>I have semi-scientifically tried this with several people in a dark room (to control for light variations even with closed eyes) and using an object rather than my finger (to try and rule out temperature) and always gotten greater than 65% correct sensing of when the object is between their eyes and I myself have gotten between 75-90% correct when having it done to me.</p>

<p>Just curious.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I believe it.  The knowledge that someone is holding a pointy stick near their face in the dark might induce a need to &quot;feel things out&quot; in any way they can.   The etheric body would respond to that need,  sending out &quot;feelers&quot; in an attempt to keep the organism informed of what is going in out there in the dark with this pointy stick. </p>

<p>When I was in junior high school, a bully ran up to me in shop class and thrust the pointy end metal file into my face,  bringing the pointy tip to within an inch of my eyes.  The sensation I picked up off the tip of that thing was insane, even though it never touched me.   It felt like a little lightning bolt was shooting out from the tip of the file and &quot;sizzling&quot; between my eyes.   I assume I was feeling his hatred and anger which was being unconsciously focused at me through the metal file as if it were a &quot;magic wand&quot;.  He didn&#39;t know what he was doing energetically,  but was throwing his weight around on an invisible level and it manifested in a really interesting way. </p>

<p>I&#39;ve never heard of the pencil-in-the-dark experiment,  thank you!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That is a win!</p>

<p>While you may not have experienced anything that caught your attention,  I have a small suggestion for you. Your wife seems like she is comfortable with her sexuality,  and that suggests she has a very active 2nd Chakra.   The next time you are &quot;getting hot and heavy&quot;, shall I say,  put your hand about 5 inches away from her 2nd chakra (about 2 inches below her navel)  which should be fully engaged and swirling like a tornado.   Hold your hand over it and then try to &quot;feel the air&quot; between your hand and her body. </p>

<p>It only takes a few seconds,  can definitely be done while naked,  and if you&#39;ve recently had a few drinks,  might possibly blow your mind. </p>

<blockquote>

<p>I included some of my personal perceptions so people were aware of what to look for and perhaps have something to relate to if they had already experienced something unexplained.    This whole post was created to encourage people in cultivating their own collection of personal experiences which might spur them on to further exploration and discovery.  If I just laid out the procedure for people with no side babbling as to why they would want to bother trying it,  how many people would I reach?  Without information or conversation to engage people in the subject,  the only people who would be inclined to try this would be those already versed in energy work. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>I advise newcomers to stay away from this one.  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>This was <strong>the</strong> procedure which offered undeniable proof to me and forever changed my understanding of reality. I chose to share it because a person can just do the hand positions <em>without understanding anything</em> about why they&#39;re doing it and still get great results.  I included as much info as I could in the post so that people of all experience levels could learn something from it. </p>

<p>I am all ears,  however,  and would be very excited if you can offer an exercise in energy work which will serve the same purpose of proving to complete newcomers that there&#39;s more to this physicality than they thought.   I searched for a few hours,  looking for information which was easily deliverable yet effective,  and found nothing which would suffice.   I have guided many people into personal perception of their energy bodies using this procedure and so knew it was very effective which is why I decided to share it with as many people as possible and will respectfully disagree;  this procedure is perfect for newcomers.  </p>

<blockquote>

<p>I understand your perspective, and did struggle with how to begin this conversation.  What I&#39;ve noticed over the years is that people have a knee-jerk reaction to this material. Folks want to immediately tell me that I am confused, as if I have somehow made it into my later years without learning that Santa was really my parents and that Tinkerbell doesn&#39;t survive on our unquestioning belief. </p>

<p>If,  however,  I start out with the,  &quot;I know you think I&#39;m nuts,  but,  let me show you something cool,&quot; angle of approach...<br/>
I&#39;ve noticed that people are far more likely to entertain what I have to say instead of just assuming I&#39;m retarded. They need to know that I am aware of their assumptions about me,  or they will not place enough trust in me to listen at all. </p>

<p>I&#39;m looking forward to your suggestions as to which techniques would be better suited to those who are not aware of the reality of unseen energies.   The more techniques available for everyone,  the better!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was on mobile and work so I had a hard time to write even these few sentences.</p>

<p>The first question is : What is your goal ? </p>

<p>If the answer is to make more people aware of the unseen energies around us you will need a much shorter technique or practice to do that. Also a technique should be used which can be done alone. Of course every technique involving higher frequencys is more powerful  the more people are involved. </p>

<p>My personal take on the matter is as follows : Those who are awake enough to follow this rabbit hole don&#39;t need much, you only need to pique their interest.</p>

<p>Normally I don&#39;t deal with these things over the internet so I am biased because &quot;my newcomers&quot; all know me personally that means they know who I am and what I do. I am a scientific person, a sceptic and very grounded and those who are drawn to me or cross my way will find themselves shocked when they hear that I have been practicing Reiki for 11 years now.</p>

<p>Depending on the person I advice one of the following two.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>If they are closed minded I will guide them to the concept of Magic and Rituals by stating the obvious &quot;Even if there is no unseen world, no higher energies, frequencyies or whatever you want to call these things, there is the truth that by practicing magic you are actively working on your personality and yourself to reach goals or dismiss unhelpful mindsets.&quot; I advise them to try out the  Qabalistic Cross and inform them that Hypnosis (which everyone heard of) was devised by Franz Anton Mesmer who himself thought of the technique after becoming an alchemist and creating the theory of the &quot;animal magneticism&quot;.  </p></li>
<li><p>If they are open minded I will simply Instruct them to try a little energy trick. This does not work for scpetics as they will simply dismiss the following as &quot;muscle tension and hallucination&quot;. I will ask the interested person to imagine either a sphere or string of light and energy, they can choose the property freely (hot,cold, red, blue ,bright,translucent... it doesn&#39;t matter at this point) and then direct it through their body. Most people will be able to feel it directly and after they confirmed that sensation I will ask them to direct this energy outside their body like a feet away. At this point a lot of them are intrigued because they can still feel it even though its far away from them. I will then once again start with a topic that might interest them and is already proven by science (Mesmer and his hypnosis or another anecdote)</p></li>
</ol>

<p>the key difference between the two is the state of mind a person is in. I try to adapt to their personality and change the nuance of my stories. And that&#39;s how I close &quot;Well it&#39;s a nice story even if it isn&#39;t true is it?&quot; an normally I walk away and let everything sink in. Only those who walk this path on their own accord are worth investing time and energy into.</p>

<p>to make it short : My difference to you is as follows :</p>

<p>I make my interaction short, provide a simple scientific basis and leave the implication open. Is that just some mind trick ? could it be helpful ?</p>

<p>Is it paranormal ? What does it mean ?</p>

<p>Is he just playing with me and trying to pull of some joke ?</p>

<p>To each their own.  </p>

<p>Visualise your Root Chakra opening and filling with the most vibrant red you can imagine with every inhalation. With every exhalation you breath out anything that isn&#39;t that magnificent red. </p>

<p>You move up to the next Chakra, which is orange,  and repeat until you have cleared them all.  </p>

<p>If you need some balance but only have a few seconds,  you can say to yourself, &quot;Red,  orange,  yellow, green, blue,  indigo, violet&quot;. When you say a color&#39;s name you almost invariably &quot;see&quot; it in your head on the back-burner.  If you&#39;ve already been practicing chakra balancing exercises your Etheric Body will know exactly what you&#39;re wanting and will start getting the house in order without needing your &quot;supervision&quot;. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Chakras are just your brain connected to your nervous system. The octopus looking brain/nerves thing is your soul. Stealing your soul is mapping the brain atomically and shutting down love, pleasure, excitement, determination, learning etc... All the things that make us human and all the things that make us enjoy life. The colors of Chakras should be labeled in the brain to where they correspond in the nervous system.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is incredible. Thank you SO SO SO much. I&#39;ve printed my copy and am starting tonight. Do you or anyone you know have a set of instructions like this for tuning forks or crystal singing bowls? I&#39;m in need of assistance in learning to use those the best way.</p>
