We know that Lucifer is always depicted as being a white dude. We know that the elite praise this fool to no end. We know that dark skinned people have always been attacked various ways. Are blacks and dark skin originally children of God while the white skins children of anti-god? Is this why throughout RECENT history, the system has attacked the black man in so many ways. Yet in ancient history, the blacks were the kings of empires. What happened in between? Touchy subject but interesting nonetheless. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That is a good question.  It depends on what you mean by Jews.  I think that today&#39;s Israel is really the Land of Canaan.  </p>

<p>I don&#39;t see the &quot;Jews&quot; as being a single group of people.  It is fractured, just like Christianity and Islam are.  I think that one group of people who call themselves Jews are descendants of Cain/Nephilim.  I hope that answers your question.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>My own theory.  A long time ago in jr. high, a warlock asked &#39;what if they find a cave and all get out.&#39;  I thought that since a cave was doable then Earth cannot be where hell is because God doesn&#39;t do anything iffy.  So, after years of thought I came up with that because it covers all the bases and there are plenty of new stars to use.  I&#39;m open to other ideas but I couldn&#39;t find anything else credible.     </p>

    <div class="md"><p>How does that even make sense. I mean, Lucifer isn&#39;t even human. </p>

<p>We tend to humanise everything and depict them as such. But if you look into proper depictions of angels and demons in theological works, you would see that they are everything but humans. Forget the depiction of sweet little baby angels. If they exist, they probably look horrifying and extremely alien to us. Same with demons.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>God, Angels, and Demons are able to “wear different garments,” they can transform themselves into man or any insect/animal. The garment Lucifer chose was one of a white man. Unfortunately if you google image Lucifer all you see is images of the TV show (search engine psyop), but if you look through the Mormon bible for instance, he is depicted as a white guy with blonde hair and wings. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>As I said, we depict everything as human because that&#39;s the only thing we can imagine. You have never seen an angel or a demon, therefore you can&#39;t really depict their true for, can you? </p>

<p>You can see this in action with a lot of Renaissance painters and sculptors. They depicted angels as babies with wings because babies are pure and without sin. </p>

<p>If the Mormon bible was written by black men, then Lucifer would be depicted as black. If it was written by asian men, then Lucifer would be depicted as an asian man. What constitutes as a white man&#39;s garment???</p>

<p>Search Engine Psyop? That doesn&#39;t really make sense. I&#39;m pretty adept at SEO, and I can assure you that search engines don&#39;t work the way you think they work. </p>
