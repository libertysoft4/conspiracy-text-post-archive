        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>It seems that the social culture of America has become so split that anyone who disagrees with the mainstream narrative is a bad person. Supporting gun ownership because it&#39;s about being able to defend yourself from a tyrannical government is wrong because you support mass shootings. Believing that socialism as requested by the liberal left is not a means to a productive society means that I&#39;m a rich bigot who doesn&#39;t want to share. Supporting legal immigration laws means that I&#39;m cold hearted, hate children, and want to separate them from their families. I can express myself however I want but if I don&#39;t want tax payer funded abortions, kids choosing to alter their genes to fit a gender identity, or a regression from trying to right every historical wrong ever done than that makes me a bad person. </p>

<p>Healthy conversations, debates, and dialogue are out of the window. Now it&#39;s just yell and protest until the loudest voice gets what they want. Certain things cannot be quantified as right or wrong. Liberty is being able to do whatever you want while allowing that same privilege to others. Let gay people pay to get a marriage license, let people pay money to get a license to register a tank, stop the oligarchy of media and pharmaceuticals, create sustainable legal immigration policies to generate a work force, and a host of other things that should expand liberty in a controlled way. This and giving law enforcement the ability to enforce the laws on those that refuse to allow people these liberties or don&#39;t follow the rules. </p>

<p>I&#39;m open having conversations with others so feel free to give me your thoughts and try to change my mind. </p>

At the end of the day most people are coming from a place of love and just differ on small things which is why it&#39;s so sad to see the lack of empathy towards people with different opinions. </p>

<p>The forced equal opportunity situations are one of the results of such ignorance of difference, where you get some quota at a profession that must be filled up with women. In order to make room for those positions men gotta get fired only because they&#39;re men, and you can bet your bottom dollar that those women won&#39;t all get in based on merit and capability of doing the job. Some of them getting in only because the quota needs to be met.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So you want to continue to villainize people like me, a liberal, while not wanting liberals to villainize people like you?</p>

<p>Have you heard the phrase &quot;Be the change you want to see in the world?&quot;</p>

<p>Nothing is going to change when both sides refuse to see each other as human beings instead of villains of the &quot;other side&quot;.</p>

<p>And you don&#39;t have to go to places like that to see how liberals are villainized. It happens a lot on reddit in various subs, including this one. </p>

<p>I think one solution to all of this hyper polarization is for people of opposing views to meet each other in person, and try to as civil as possible explain their views, how they came to form their views, and as well as possible solutions that both can agree with. </p>

<p>The important part is to start to see the other side as humans and have empathy for each other even if you wind up not agreeing on anything or changing minds.</p>

<p>So when you comment that &quot;you want to continue to villainize people like me, a liberal, while not wanting liberals to villainize people like you?&quot; you&#39;re doing exactly what you claim is being done to you and calling it good. I did not villainize liberals and you may say you did not villainize me but I believe that quote is an assertions of villainization. You may disagree and you are perfectly welcome to. </p>

<p>I feel it is very apparent that my opinion is in the minority and I am well aware of that. This is why I am trying to create dialogue to understand where other people are coming from.

    <div class="md"><p>The abortion debate should be about when a fetus becomes a life. Because once that fetus becomes a person you&#39;re refusing that person the right to live by having an abortion. That&#39;s the debate that needs to be had.

<p>We can argue semantics but tax funded abortions do happen, non profits provide abortions and resources with tax payer money (because they&#39;re not paying taxes), and abortion is such a polarizing topic that comes down to what you believe in. For that last reason alone I typically refuse to talk about it and let people believe whatever they want.</p>

<p>.</p>

<p>that is a debate, and certain states had set certain cut off times. so from here on out, i&#39;m assuming that you would support common sense abortion, where you aren&#39;t killing an already developed person.   </p>

<blockquote>
<p>We charge murders for 2 lives when someone kills a pregnant women but a women can end that life and not be held responsible. </p>

<p>.</p>

<p>i have seen that reference. think about it deeply. what difference is there between when a women chooses to get an abortion *** before the cutoff date, and then someone who fires and injures a pregnant woman who wanted to have a baby, regardless of whether the fetus was developed or not?</p>

<p>.</p>

<p>***for the sake of the argument, in the accepted time frame before the fetus develops past a mass of cells into a person<br/>
.</p>

<p>god i hope you see the extreme difference there.<br/>

<ol>
<li>so you are saying&quot; the church&quot; steals from the tax payers as well for not paying property tax, yes? </li>
</ol>

<p>your idea of tax payed funded abortions is a non profit that raises money from outside sources to provide a service at no profit to the workers or company, to a person who could not afford to do so otherwise, theft from the government tax payers because they do not pay taxes on the money they receive?  is yes, then see point 1.</p>

They get PAID to work for the non profit, Planned Parenthood CEO makes over $500,000 a year.
