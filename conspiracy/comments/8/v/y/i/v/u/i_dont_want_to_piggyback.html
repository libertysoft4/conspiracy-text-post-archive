<p>This thread got me thinking earlier. </p>

<p>Anyone think it&#39;s possible they are only spending $350,000 in export costs, while obtaining pure and cheap product number 5 from stepan?</p>

<p>Cut it down, and sell 100x what they bought worth?</p>

<p>It&#39;s probably not easy to import much to Japan. We only get it from stepan and mexico really. Doesn&#39;t grow well worldwide.</p>

<p>&quot;The Stepan Corporation, a New Jersey-based chemical processing company, performs the extraction on the coca leaves. Stepan has an arrangement with the Drug Enforcement Agency and is the only company allowed to legally import the coca leaf into the United States. Stepan imports 175,000 kilograms of coca leaves into the United States each year. That is a street value equivalent to roughly $21 billion of cocaine, according to the United Nations.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Coca-Cola includes as an ingredient a coca leaf extract prepared by a Stepan Company plant in Maywood, New Jersey.[2] The facility, which had been known as the Maywood Chemical Works, was purchased by Stepan in 1959.[3] The plant is the only commercial entity in the United States authorized by the Drug Enforcement Administration to import coca leaves, which come primarily from Peru. Approximately 100 metric tons of dried coca leaf are imported each year. The cocaine-free leaves are sold to The Coca-Cola Company for use in soft drinks, while the cocaine is sold to Mallinckrodt, a pharmaceutical firm, for medicinal purposes.</p>

<p>From their Wikipedia. Yes, they do sell cocaine if that&#39;s what you meant.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve tried to look up how much medical grade cocaine can be made from a kilo of dried leaves and saw answers ranging from 5 grams to 500 grams per kilo of leaves..so it really depends on the plant. But I doubt that they would be growing the 5 grams per kilo of leaves plants at a medicinal grow op</p>

    <div class="md"><p>In the U.S., a kilo of stepped on cocaine (low grade) can sell for upwards of $40,000... So even at that price it would be about 7 billion dollars worth of cocaine... You cut that medical grade (99% pure) down to low grade (60-70%) and you make quite a nice profit if your the only company in the United States allowed to produce it.. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The article states a shipment to Japan. Coca doesn&#39;t really grow there. It would probably fetch quite a bit more. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, I was trying to look up figures for how much weight can fit in a shipping container of powdered pure cocaine, and how much it would cost to get a fully loaded shipping container from the u.s. to Japan to see what the real numbers might be if that&#39;s the export price.. and I&#39;m definitely not high enough at the moment to actually go deep enough into export laws and such to figure that out at the moment haha.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No worries, and yea it is, lol. I tried looking up costs of importing, but didn&#39;t want to be added to a list for this &quot;product&quot; so just stopped, hah. I&#39;d imagine that importing (legally) 170 kilos is going to be more in the ball park of like 35+ million, if the profit(s) is in the billions. A complete guess, but, sounds more &quot;reasonable&quot;, imo. Could be wrong. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ok.. so.. a large shipping container of 40 ft length can hold 2,400 cubic ft. of product if stuffed door to door. One cubic ft. Of cocaine is 38.08lbs still trying to figure out the cost to ship said container from New Jersey to Japan.. but a standard, large shipping container can fit 91,392lbs of cocaine not including whatever wrapping/packaging it is inside of.. which is obviously a whole heck of a lot lol</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Cost to ship a 40 ft container on average after getting price quotes from a few places is $2.60 per mile, so it depends on the route that the ship takes, and how many stops it makes along the way.

    <div class="md"><p>A hell of a lot cheaper than that I would imagine, also when talking to the receptionists at a few international shipping stations on the east coast. It seems excessively easy to send large amounts of cocaine overseas, I was asking basic questions that a cocaine smuggle may ask. Are people going to look in my crate? What about customs? Customs overseas? </p>

<p>I was told that the chances of my shipping container being checked at any point along the way was about 1 in 10.. </p>

<p>I&#39;d imagine shipping via a company would be expensive, but I guess they could have an agency that takes care of things for them. </p>
