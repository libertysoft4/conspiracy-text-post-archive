        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I’ve seen the topic of DMT come up so often here and invariably it’s recommended with the utmost praise. I think people should be careful with this chemical and question whether it’s really a good thing to do. Anyone who is telling you it’s this purely enlightening experience is feeding you a load of New Age crap. Understanding what DMT is becomes more clear in the context of Gnosticism. The universe consists of consciousness existing on all different frequencies. Residing just off our own frequency in the lower fourth dimension are entities that have come to be known as “Archons.” These entities are disincarnate beings who lack creative intentionality but are experts at manipulating and parasiting off others’ energy fields. They are also by many accounts the controlling consciousness on this planet which has utilized the human species as an energy farm for thousands of years. When a person takes DMT or ayahuasca, they are essentially projecting their soul-body into the lower fourth dimension and putting it at the mercy of these energetic parasites. Does that sound like a fun time to you? We would all do better to protect our energy fields rather than experimentally project them into alternate planes.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Many of these natural substances such as DMT are made in the human body in some alternate form. We have endogenous systems already capable of processing these things, such as the endocannabinoid system that is responsible for modulating different cannabinoids that your body produces such as <a href="https://herb.co/marijuana/news/anandamide-aea">Anandamide</a> which is the human body&#39;s version of THC. </p>

<p><em>There are</em> theories that there is a &quot;consciousness producing&quot; system in the body, and that some of these psychedelic chemicals may modulate them in some way but not enough is known due to legality. </p>

<p>I find it interesting that the second half of your post, you say matter-of-factly without flinching as you believe it to be absolute truth... Yet, you are skeptical that something that is naturally produced within the body can interact with the brain?</p>

<p>Do not take this observation as an attack on you.  It just seems, from the outside looking in, things are a little... backwards.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Is DMT structurally similar to Melatonin and Serotonin? I thought it was so I&#39;d guess that it would be produced in the same area of the brain. DMT does cross the blood brain barrier though so even if it isn&#39;t produced in the brain, some of it should end up there.</p>

<p>It is converted in the brain very quickly though (which is why Ayahuasca lasts so much longer than pure DMT) so if we only produce trace amounts, it would be eliminated so quickly that it may not be detected.</p>

<p>I purposely left that vague so I could wait for that response. I’ve done it many times. That’s not what my post is about though. I take issue with the way it’s portrayed. The idea that it’s some “positive” journey that teaches you things is false. It is purely an experience that more often than not can be described as dark, sinister and alien.</p>

<p>Really, in contrast to salvia, you very rarely hear any sort of dark, negative stories from DMT trips. If you do hear one, that person is likely extremely fucked up and should have a lot of less intense psychedelic experiences before trying the big one again.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Eh, &quot;strange and alien&quot; and &quot;sinister and evil&quot; are sometimes conflated by theologically minded folks, but I feel like fully transcendent psychadelic experiences trigger an entheogenesis of sorts that typically overrides such 3rd dimensional pleasantries as &quot;good and evil.&quot; </p>

<p>So my suggestion is more, not less. If the goal is to escape or transcend whatever demon apparitions that are potentially inhabiting the 3D minds of the aforementioned theologically oriented, then you gotta either up the dose or work on releasing the ego. Either way-</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I thought you used the term imaginary. Anyway though, all good. I know this poster who started this thread; he&#39;s trolling you guys. After studying the Gnostic mythology, I do believe that there are these &quot;archons.&quot; Archons are predatory aliens. DMT is literally the exact opposite; it&#39;s a psychedelic technology designed to show us these other dimensions and evolve. If you&#39;ve never done it- nothing can prepare you for how intense and otherworldly it is.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, you can&#39;t have an experience in the negative. You can&#39;t have an experience that humans are the only intelligence life around. That&#39;s called: lying.

<p>You don&#39;t know I am lying. I had experiences with entities, I just don&#39;t use the word &quot;Alien&quot; to describe them because it comes with the pre-existing notion they are extra terrestrial. I don&#39;t see any evidence they are extra terrestrial. 
Different people (in those studies) all agreed on certain aspects sure, but the word Alien used by everyone? No.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I too have experienced &#39;negative&#39; or at least non-benevolent entity contact on the deems.  On more than one occasion I came back to myself thinking hmmmm I&#39;m not sure that&#39;s always a good thing to do.  I was OK, I didn&#39;t really empower them to have a really bad time, but I felt a gut feeling that they didn&#39;t have my best interest in mind... they were suspiciously &#39;showy&#39; to try and get my attention.  </p>

<p>I&#39;ve encountered other entities that seem much more benevolent, but I wouldn&#39;t be surprised to find out you can indeed get fucked up from negative entities by carelessly indulging in DMT.  I too am skeptical about it slipping more into the mainstream... netflix, joe rogan, etc.  That said, I&#39;ve had some amazing experiences with dmt as well.  YMMV who the fuck knows what really is going on there!!! haha.  That said --  will do again :p</p>

<p>Residing just off our own frequency in the lower fourth dimension are entities that have come to be known as “Archons.” These entities are disincarnate beings who lack creative intentionality but are experts at manipulating and parasiting off others’ energy fields. They are also by many accounts the controlling consciousness on this planet which has utilized the human species as an energy farm for thousands of years. When a person takes DMT or ayahuasca, they are essentially projecting their soul-body into the lower fourth dimension and putting it at the mercy of these energetic parasites.</p>

<p>I find it interesting that the second half of your post, you say matter-of-factly without flinching as you believe it to be absolute truth... Yet, you are skeptical that something that is naturally produced within the body can interact with the brain?</p>

<p>Do not take this observation as an attack on you.  It just seems, from the outside looking in, things are a little... backwards.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Eh, &quot;strange and alien&quot; and &quot;sinister and evil&quot; are sometimes conflated by theologically minded folks, but I feel like fully transcendent psychadelic experiences trigger an entheogenesis of sorts that typically overrides such 3rd dimensional pleasantries as &quot;good and evil.&quot; </p>

<p>So my suggestion is more, not less. If the goal is to escape or transcend whatever demon apparitions that are potentially inhabiting the 3D minds of the aforementioned theologically oriented, then you gotta either up the dose or work on releasing the ego. Either way-</p>

<p>Ya gotta rise up! Higher and higher! Yeow!</p>
