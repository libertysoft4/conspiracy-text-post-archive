        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>My Evil Ex Step Mother. No exaggeration, no joke here. </p>

<p>In Russia, around 2002?: Someone blew up her car and set fire to her apartment. So she blew up their whole office building. My dad was over there visiting, they ended up hiding in Turkey for awhile.</p>

<p>A year or so after that she and her teenage daughter were brought to US by my dad. Day one: EPIC freakout over not being able to plug her laptop in (converter didn&#39;t work or something.) I was really young. Remember being scared cuz she was screaming. Her laptop was very very very important. </p>

<p>She owned multiple logistics companies during the time I lived with her (until 2011). Her job, in her words, was to make sure things got across the border (europe). When she came to US she got a third company and was expanding into AC units (US), and other random stuff. I saw multiple cargos of &quot;Hazmat&quot; being shipped into Ukraine. </p>

<p>She had fake notary stamps</p>

<p>She asked me to help her with emails in English. Usually I had to &quot;Make it sound like a threat, but not a threat. They know what will happen.&quot; And I mean, actual threat, not business appropriate threat. </p>

<p>Whenever I asked what she &#39;really&#39; did she said she would tell me when I was older.</p>

<p>During the divorce, she provided fake payroll information, signed by a company in Argentina, that had no record of ever having anything to do with her. Also, she keeps trying to say she&#39;s just an employee of one of the companies.</p>

<p>Apparently I&#39;m the only one who knew even this little bit of info or that she had multiple companies. My dad didn&#39;t know. </p>

<p>My Dad met her online. My Step Sister majored in Global Affairs and then quickly went back to Russia. I just dunno what the goal of the marriage was, she hated every minute of it. It was obvious Step Mom didn&#39;t love my Dad, and now she&#39;s a US citizen.</p>

<p>The worst part is that this complete garbage person is over here, sneering at everything around her when SHE chose to come here! And now she is emotionally and physically abusing my youngest brother, just like she abused me and my other brothers (but not her precious daughter, huh?) Anyway, I know what she is. I didn&#39;t really care for a long time because I was young. But now she&#39;s trying to fuck up my brother? No. I was made to protect that kid. </p>

<p>I need help.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, I don&#39;t hide online anymore (except financial info and things like that.) I want to be a leader in children&#39;s educational media. My fucky past brought me to that and I&#39;m not afraid to answer for the shitty person I used to be if it comes up in the future, which is why I don&#39;t delete posts either. I used to be obsessed with anonymousness, and it has it&#39;s place. But not to hide experiences and opinions. Also, got arrested and the cops read all my journals and turned my laptop upside down. If something is a secret, I dont type it or say it. If it&#39;s not a secret, I don&#39;t need to be anonymous.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Assuming this is all true and not just a joke post, it sounds more likely that she is involved in organized crime than that she is a spy. Spies don&#39;t bomb office buildings in retaliation for car bombings, don&#39;t get confused by electrical outlets, and don&#39;t need their children to help write threatening emails. At least not competent spies.</p>

<p>I&#39;d try contacting CPS to help get your brother out of that situation. If she is being emotionally and physically abusive, and you are able to prove it, then they will be able to get him away from her. As for the criminal activities, maybe an anonymous tip to the FBI or interpol? If she blew up a building then I would assume there are a few people who would be very interested in whatever information you have.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I disagree with this comment across the board. This lady is definitely a spy. Her cover was internet dating. Tell me 1 other mail bride that is involved in &quot;organized crime.&quot; And I don&#39;t know what type of gangsters you know, but none that I know even have basic knowledge of explosives, let alone rigging an entire building! This lady is either a spy or she works with an American intelligence agency as an informant, 100%. Now what you do is the tricky part. I would be very careful about how you go about reporting this as she may be involved in sensitive cases and by you blowing her cover, you inadvertently may blow another dangerous ppls cover. Understand that these ppl don&#39;t play by the rules and won&#39;t hesitate to hurt you or a loved one to send you a msg to back off. Not trying to scare you away from telling, just informing you ahead of time so that if you decide to, you will do it in a way where it won&#39;t be traced back to you. Try your best to make it seem coming from anyone but you. Good luck. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not sure about which of the CIA or the FBI is the right body for this inquiry. On the one hand, it sounds international so the <a href="https://www.cia.gov/cgi-bin/comment_form.cgi">CIA&#39;s contact page</a> sounds appropriate. On the other hand, it sounds domestic and possibly cross-state, so perhaps it&#39;s one for the <a href="https://www.cia.gov/cgi-bin/comment_form.cgi">FBI tip-off page</a> instead.</p>
