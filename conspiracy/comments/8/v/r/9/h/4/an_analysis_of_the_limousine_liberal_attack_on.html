        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I have a conspiracy to share with you all <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>.  At a minimum, it&#39;s case study on the anatomy of a political smear and how it propagates.  Maybe more.  I am going to attempt to provide detailed evidence to show that:</p>

<ul>
<li>There appears to have been a coordinated effort over the last three days to smear Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez for being a &quot;limousine liberal&quot;.</li>
<li>The smear originates with Breitbart.com.  It is not a secret that Breitbart has deep ties to the White House.</li>
<li>The effort to spread it on reddit looks very much like the tactics used by the <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-43093390">Russian Internet Research Agency (IRA)</a></li>
</ul>

<h1>Background</h1>

<p>Sunday morning, I saw a rising post on r/libertarian about Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez:  <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/Libertarian/comments/8vaxq8/all_hail_the_limousine_liberal/">&quot;All Hail the Limousine Liberal&quot;</a>.  WARNING:  It&#39;s a cancerous thread.</p>

<p>Especially early on in the thread, there were 10x more trolls than normal for r/libertarian.  That sub is totally unmoderated, and trolls, especially alt-right ones, are no new thing, but usually in the minority.  The Ocasio-Cortez attack had an entirely different and Orwellian feel to me.  I got sucked into a frustrating semantic debate with one individual over the factual claims in the meme.</p>

<p>The post slams Ocasio-Cortez for claiming to be from the Bronx, while spending her formative years in &quot;Yorktown heights, one of the wealthiest enclaves in the country - complete with 2 golf courses.&quot;  When I went to look for information about Yorktown Heights (I just wanted to see if it was actually &quot;a wealthy enclave&quot;), it got really weird.</p>

<p><em>Someone had editted the wikipedia article on Yorktown Heights.</em>  Anonymous users had added an important new section, <strong>Golf Courses</strong>, noting, that there are two.  It&#39;s a weirdly specific add in an otherwise minimal article.</p>

<p>What&#39;s more, a wikipedian had added a link back to a <a href="https://www.zerohedge.com/news/2018-06-29/girl-bronx-ocasio-cortez-called-out-fact-check-actually-grew-wealthy-enclave">regurgitation of the smear</a> on an Alt-Right site ZeroHedge.  Additionally, Ocasio-Cortez had been added to the list of notable people from the town.  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Yorktown_Heights%2C_New_York&amp;amp;type=revision&amp;amp;diff=848323961&amp;amp;oldid=846321931">You can see the wikipedia revisions from over the weekend here.</a></p>

<p>I thought that was a little interesting and hilarious, so I spent some time looking for more information.</p>

<h1>Origin of the Smear</h1>

<p>Based on <a href="https://www.google.com/search?biw=1311&amp;amp;bih=895&amp;amp;tbs=qdr%3Aw&amp;amp;tbm=nws&amp;amp;ei=ks85W7fhIYeB5wKVwar4AQ&amp;amp;q=%27girl+from+the+bronx%27+alexandria+ocasio-cortez&amp;amp;oq=%27girl+from+the+bronx%27+alexandria+ocasio-cortez&amp;amp;gs_l=psy-ab.3...3857.19792.0.19904.56.49.6.0.0.0.128.3130.47j2.49.0....0...1c.1.64.psy-ab..1.19.1120...0j0i13k1j0i10k1.0.C8PSbkrThKk">Google News results</a>, the smear first shows up on June 29th in <a href="https://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2018/06/29/fact-check-girl-from-the-bronx-alexandria-ocasio-cortez-grew-up-in-one-of-richest-u-s-counties/">an article on Breitbart.com about &quot;The Girl from the Bronx</a>.  The <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-5905247/Girl-Bronx-Alexandria-Ocasio-Cortez-actually-grew-wealthy-Westchester-County.html">Daily Mail drops it</a> the next day, June 30th.  A bunch of other alt-right (Newsmax, the Blaze, ZeroHedge) and blog spam sites follow.</p>

<p><a href="http://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/395090-ocasio-cortez-shreds-conservative-commentator-for-sharing-picture-of-her">The Hill covers the controversy yesterday</a> including Ocasio-Cortez&#39;s response on Twitter.</p>

<h1>The Trump Connection</h1>

<p>It won&#39;t be news to anyone here, but Breitbart has strong connections to Trump.  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Bannon">Steve Bannon</a>, who served Trump&#39;s as Chief Strategist during the election and in the White House, was a founding member at Breitbart, and also served as CEO before and after his White House tenure.  Breitbart is currently <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebekah_Mercer">owned by Rebekah Mercer</a>.  Mercer is <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2018/01/05/rebekah-mercer-the-billionaire-backer-of-bannon-and-trump-chooses-sides/?utm_term=.f862f49051b0">a top Trump donor and confidant.</a></p>

<p>I&#39;ll acknowledge, none of this is terrifically remarkable or even news.  This is hardly the first Brietbart smear.  There&#39;s no direct evidence the White House had any connection to the smear, and even if they did, the Trump white house wouldn&#39;t be the first to dictate a political attack to favorable media.  People are probably sick of hearing the about the Bannon-Trump-Mercer boogeyman.  It also is possible that the originator of the smear is Joshua Caplan, the author of the Breitbart article, and the whole thing is perfectly organic.</p>

<p>I think there&#39;s more to it.</p>

<h1>Social Media</h1>

<p>The twitter discussion is predictably vitriolic. <a href="https://twitter.com/johncardillo?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1013510482433626113&amp;amp;ref_url=http%3A%2F%2Fthehill.com%2Fhomenews%2Fcampaign%2F395090-ocasio-cortez-shreds-conservative-commentator-for-sharing-picture-of-her">Newsmax&#39;s Cardillo seems to lead the charge there and his comments get a ton of a traction.</a> He concedes only that she did indeed go to BU, and dies on the semantic hill of &quot;you&#39;re not from the Bronx because you moved when you were five.&quot;</p>

<p>In addition to well known alt-right journalists like Cardillo, there&#39;s the usual army of trolls tweeting obnoxious shit directly at Ocasio-Cortez, <a href="https://twitter.com/Oil_Guns_Merica/status/1013508807689949186">like this one</a>.  I have no indication they are Russian spammers, and I&#39;m not a Twitter user so I&#39;m not sure how I&#39;d tell.</p>

<p>&quot;Limousine Liberal/Bronx Girl&quot; is also <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=site:4chan.org+%22limousine+liberal%22+alexandria+ocasio-cortez&amp;amp;biw=1227&amp;amp;bih=899&amp;amp;tbs=qdr:w&amp;amp;tbm=isch&amp;amp;source=iu&amp;amp;ictx=1&amp;amp;fir=NXz6u3p2QQz1vM%253A%252CZo91rpCJnQofoM%252C_&amp;amp;usg=__Zlrv_K_pyKHnvlky_jn_EPuJWTg%3D&amp;amp;sa=X&amp;amp;ved=0ahUKEwioqNG6h4DcAhWDtVkKHUPaCk8Q9QEIKzAB#imgrc=NXz6u3p2QQz1vM:">pumped heavily on darker corners of the internet like /pol/</a></p>

<p>On Reddit, the smear gets gets a lot of airtime at The_Donald <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/8uwku2/fact_check_girl_from_the_bronx_alexandria/">on this thread, +3.1k</a>.  r/Conservative <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/Conservative/comments/8uytd6/girl_from_the_bronx_ocasiocortez_called_out_in/">discusses it here, +357</a>  The r/Libertarian [thread is here, +32]().  It gets posted in quite a few other places where it gets no traction, such as r/worldpolitics, where it <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/worldpolitics/comments/8ux0tb/fact_check_girl_from_the_bronx_alexandria/">sunk to zero</a>.  It also <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/WayOfTheBern/comments/8vaxx6/all_hail_the_limousine_liberal/">sinks to zero</a> on <a href="/r/WayOfTheBern">/r/WayOfTheBern</a>.</p>

<h1>Russian Trolls on Reddit</h1>

<p>In response to <a href="https://www.vox.com/2018/2/16/17020974/mueller-indictment-internet-research-agency">Mueller&#39;s indictment of Russia troll farm &quot;Internet Research Agency&quot; in St. Petersberg</a>, reddit announced three months ago that reddit had seen <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/827zqc/in_response_to_recent_reports_about_the_integrity/">&quot;direct propaganda&quot;</a> from the IRA.  Admins reported two months ago that they had <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/8bb85p/reddits_2017_transparency_report_and_suspect/">subsequently have banned</a> 944 <a href="https://np.reddit.com/wiki/suspiciousaccounts">suspicious accounts</a> linked to the IRA.</p>

<p>The 944 banned accounts have lots in common with the three perpetrators of the Ocasio-Cortez meme on Reddit:</p>

<ul>
<li>High volume posting for hours and days on end.</li>
<li>Very low participation/comments, even in their own threads.</li>
<li>Posts are 98% consistent with the IRA strategy of inflaming and dividing.</li>
</ul>

<p><a href="https://np.reddit.com/user/ultimaregem">ultimaregem</a> is egregiously busy posting dozens of articles an hour every day in 8-10 hour blocks.  That account is so busy with submissions, it&#39;s lucky if it makes 10 comments for every post.</p>

<p><a href="https://np.reddit.com/user/Aldebaran333">Aldebaran333</a> appears to be an inhuman machine.  That account is making dozens of submissions per hour, often times 24 hours a day, and has been doing so for days on end.  If there&#39;s a single human there, someone needs to pry them off the computer immediately before they die of addiction to reddit.  <a href="https://np.reddit.com/user/Aldebaran333">Aldebaran333</a> dates back to July 2016.  </p>

<p><a href="https://np.reddit.com/user/brotherbear12345">brotherbear12345</a>, in his brief time on Reddit since April, and has a different posting strategy.  That account posts almost exclusively to T_D, at lower volume than the others.  BrotherBear has a knack for hitting home runs.  Yet in hundreds and hundreds of submissions with thousands of karma each, Brotherbear hasn&#39;t participated in the discussion at all.  They&#39;ve made only a single comment: &quot;There&#39;s No Such Thing As A Law-Abiding &quot;ILLEGAL ALIEN&quot;, posted yesterday.</p>

<p>It appears that just about all of the discussion of the topic of &quot;Bronx Girl&quot; on reddit was prompted by Russian trolls.</p>

<p>Having said all of that, there&#39;s less nefarious explanations for the activity from these three accounts, I&#39;m sure.  And absolutely, my analysis and evidence doesn&#39;t prove they&#39;re trolls from Russia.  The best I think one could do without access to more data is show a pattern.  I think the patter is clear enough to warrant a closer look, maybe even from the admins.</p>

<h1>Conclusion</h1>

<p>You can imagine Ocasio-Cortez reveling in the aftermath of her surprise victory last week.  She&#39;s already seen some backlash, and she&#39;s prepared for more, I would presume.  But unbeknownst to her, there&#39;s a dark tidal wave forming in the alt-right media, on reddit, twitter and 4chan.  By Sunday, the whole thing crashes on top of her when she&#39;s forced to respond to people tweeting pictures of her home.  Imagine too, that a week ago, few had heard of her.  A wild ride, I&#39;m sure. </p>

<p>I hope at least, the whole thing is maybe case study on how political attacks are spread. I&#39;ll acknowledge again, there&#39;s no direct link to the White House.  And I haven&#39;t at all proven the posts on reddit are coming from Russia.</p>

<p>Nonetheless, I&#39;ll speculate somewhat irresonsponsibly on a conspiracy.  </p>

<p><em>It&#39;s possible this whole thing starts with communications from the White House, or someone close.</em>  An order goes out to Breitbart - &quot;this is the story we&#39;re going with today, write it.&quot;  That&#39;s a &quot;talking point&quot; and not unprecedented in US politics.  </p>

<p><em>The second communication is to someone in Russia and is treasonous.</em>  &quot;Put your team on pumping this story up, comrade.&quot;  It becomes a tremendous hit, which is a huuuuge win for the White House.  In one fell swoop, they&#39;ve fired up the base about a new boogeyman, demonized an up-and-comer in the opposition party, and also completely distracted people from the relentlessly negative news that surround the White House.  </p>

<p>It&#39;s the same partnership with Russian intel that got Trump to the White House, and it keeps working.  And not just on this smear.  Just look at those post histories for the trolls I mentioned!  There&#39;s dozens of specious claims like this each week, and plenty that catch on.  Even as the Mueller investigation rages, the Russian government is still hard at work on Trump&#39;s behalf.  Is that implausible?</p>

<p>Maybe that&#39;s too ambitious of a claim given the limited evidence.  Nonetheless it&#39;s fascinating to dive deep on how these smears spread.  What do you all think?</p>

<p>One: steve bannon wasnt currently employed at Breitbart during his tenure at the white house</p>

<p>Two: steve bannon no longer works for trump</p>

<p>Pretty flimsy</p>

<p>Especially considering you ignore the fact that tons of major journalists and CEOs at Major news networks like CNN MSNBC excetera or I&#39;ll have major ties to the Obama Administration. Obama and Floyd several journalists from CNN and ABC. Many of his administration officials breather the family members or spouses of CEOs at Networks</p>

<p>I see it more as pointing that she is just another Establishment candidate instead of anything else she is being painted as by MSM.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>so far he is keeping his campaign promises to them, or at least trying hard to keep them, so they recognize this and support him.</p>

<p>They never claimed that they care if president is from rich or poor family - thats something Democratic Party supporters do often - they only care about if he supports their issues or not.</p>

<p>Except Trump ended up supporting the GOP nominee and going against the Democrat nominee. Still, AL rejected Trump&#39;s nominee. </p>

<p>Yeah. Look at Trump&#39;s approval rating in this strong economy, people are going against him.</p>

<p>No. Dems are fired up to go vote, this future pick will fuel the fire. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not saying what Russia did is bullshit.  I am saying that investigations linked to Russia were going on prior to Trump and the meddling influence is limited.  The bullshit is the spin effort to connect Russia to Trump as if he worked closely with them to win the election.  As if he is some puppet of Putin.  It&#39;s all a big theatrical show that kept democrats from questioning the real massive loss that the DNC has not truly addressed.  The media hasn&#39;t shared how all their polls were wrong yet the polls being used by Trump team were accurate.  Basically Russia serves as a distraction.  Everyone who is Democrat that makes a racists or homophobic statement on social media blames Russia.  Any conservative trend on Twitter gets labeled as Russian.  It&#39;s a made up boogeyman like ISIS.  </p>

<p>Most of the Trump voting Democrats previously voted for Obama, back when he was pretending to be more progressive than he actually was.  Most of the frequently cited reasons for Trump Democrats are also fairly left wing, such as trade, his campaign trail talk against the forever war, disgust with legalized bribery of politicians, his (broken) promise of major infrastructure spending, and his (broken) promise not to cut medicare/medicaid.  They left the democratic party because it shifted too far to the right, even if the MSM&#39;s widespread right-wing bias makes it hard to acknowledge that. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Democrats went right wing with favoring big corporate and aspects of globalism but the biggest push was social policy.

    <div class="md"><p>A very small faction within the Democratic Party supports open borders, even if it has been growing recently.  Remember how Obama deported record numbers, or how nearly every sitting Democrat who had the chance voted to create ICE and fund a border wall?  Identity politics is something widely practiced by Republicans as well, and what identity politics is used as a euphemism for (acknowledgement that different communities have their own issues and deserve representation) isn&#39;t particularly left wing, particularly as the Democratic Party almost universally uses those symbolic appeals to identity to excuse their refusal to do anything material to address the inequality between different groups.  Socialist internationalism is radically different from neoliberal globalism.  Regardless of how right-wing propagandists try to paint it, the &quot;globalism&quot; people are reacting to isn&#39;t socialist.  </p>

<p>And everybody uses identity politics, the GOP especially.</p>

<p>I do recall Obama&#39;s claim of deportation and the forming of ICE which is now being promoted by the Democrat to abolish it. </p>

<p>There are many forms of identity politics.  Yes it is played on both sides but the focus of Dems have been on social policy like same sex bathrooms when we had high unemployment and middle class being raked over on taxes, wages and health premiums.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Joe Manchin supports the wall.  Plenty of Democratic electeds supported walls when it wasn&#39;t Trump administering it.  And its absurd that you equate &quot;not supporting Trump&#39;s specific proposals&quot; with &quot;open borders.&quot;</p>

<p>Obama didn&#39;t &quot;claim&quot; deportation, he deported millions of undocumented immigrants.  Many Democrats, including the majority of Senate Democrats, voted to create ICE back in 2001, and so far none of them has recanted that position.</p>

<p>Your characterization of the Democratic Party&#39;s focus is incorrect, but also a prime example of what I talked about in my last post.  Using cultural stances to give Democrats cover with their base to excuse them continuing right-wing economic and foreign policies is exactly the opposite of Democrats moving to the left.  For the record, Democrats did not support same sex bathrooms.  They supported letting trans people use bathrooms, which is both perfectly reasonable and completely minor, and was not at all the focus of Democratic strategy until conservatives decided to make it the centerpiece of their outrage.  The Obama administration did do a lot to address unemployment (bringing it down considerably) and middle class economic issues.  You could argue what they did wasn&#39;t effective, but the reasons they didn&#39;t do more have nothing to do with trans bathrooms, and instead from a) the republicans prevented or sabotaged most of Obama&#39;s economic proposals once they took the house and state governments in 2010, and b) the Obama democratic party was neoliberal af, and thus were happy to leave things to the market, give money to the rich in hope it&#39;d trickle down, that sort of thing: again, the opposite of moving to the left.</p>

<p>Also, this was post was quite a screed. You really busted out the thesaurus in your descriptions of the donald as the dark corners of internet savagery like people discussing a limousine liberal is akin to the orca gathering in Mordor.</p>

<p>What the op was thin on was actual evidence that this girl is not being deceptive about her backstory.</p>

<p>The socialist in question here went on tv and tried to act like she was the socialist Cardi B, a bronx girl representing. </p>

<p>The problem is she is really from Westchester County and lived in York town where the median income is 108,000 for a household</p>

<p>Kind of interesting that she is a socialist. </p>

<p>Is she going to be supporting school choice also since her life story is a dramatic example of the need for it?</p>

<p>Or is socialist rhetoric going to suddenly transform failing schools?</p>

<p>Now the funniest thing is that a simple 10 minute google search reveals a much more sinister conspiracy then breitbart or others uncovered about this Alexandria Cortez.</p>

<p>Her entire story of being a grassroots candidate funded by only 300,000 is a complete lie.</p>

<p>She is being funded by socialists in the tech industry.</p>

<p>How? Her entire branding was created by a company called tandemnyc. </p>

<p>Tandem nycs webpage has zero information on it and their LinkedIn says it is a small company of 5 people.</p>

<p>Interesting that their happens to be a much larger company called tandem comms who’s “clients in the news” page includes stories about dozens of tech startups all presented in tech news sites as rebel grassroots startups.</p>

<p>That is amidst stories about their other small rebel clients... <strong>such as apple and Samsung</strong></p>

<p>lol and behold tandem comms says they have offices in New York and Austin.</p>

<p>How can she win an election with “$300,000”?</p>

<p>Well considering marketing agency’s clients are literally Apple and samsung..... </p>

<p>Oh wait this tandem comms also operates in the uk how weird.</p>

<p>The Uk tandem is far more transparent.</p>

<p>The uk tandem was set up by an actual Royal Air Force officer.</p>

<p>What do they offer?</p>

<p>“Key skills:
Strategic communication advice, planning and action

<p>I wonder how she won?</p>

<p>Could it be because online ad spending doesn’t have to include disclaimers or be disclosed?</p>

<p>Interesting that the tandem comms uk website says the ceo leads a staff of 6500 people.</p>

<p>But wait there’s more!</p>

<p>There is a tandem comms located in Atlanta Georgia?</p>

<p>However, I think how you feel about AOC is immaterial from the point I am trying to make with this post.  The point was to dissect how the Trump propaganda machine operates.  It&#39;s quite scary and Orwellian when you break it down.  A story emerges on Breitbart, other pro-Trump sites follow, then there is a coordinated and concerted effort by bots/astroturfers to promulgate the story over social media.  </p>

<p>I think that its more Orwellian that she is getting so much airtime on MSM while at the same time being perceived by general population as someone who beat Establishment.</p>

<p>If they (Democratic Establishment) were really unhappy with her winning, they would be trying to bury this story as much as possible.</p>

<p>She is all over the MSM - interviews talk shows, favorable articles .... feel good stories all over the place.</p>

<p>Thats first red flag for me.</p>

<p>In the meantime Republican party Media, seeing all this, recognized her as a danger coming from Democratic Party establishment and started attacking her from whatever angle they can come up. Its what they do (its what both Parties do to each other) - so it only makes sense. Nothing unusual here.</p>

<p>Its presented as david vs goliath story, because MSM nad Democratic Party knows that people love underdog story and that they will fall for it. (Hollywood kitchen)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You need something (at least one) strong to run on - thus &quot;Medicare for all&quot; - Ones you win (if you win) you dont really have to deliever, you just have to pretend as if you are trying really hard while pointing finger at other party as a reason why you are not able to deliver.</p>

<p>Remember how Obama campaigned on closing Guantanamo (among other things) in his first campaign? At that time it was big issue (waterboarding and torture talk was all over the media)</p>

<p>He gave up on that promise in like second year. Guantanamo is still running today and nobody even talks about it anymore.</p>

<p>So the fact that you are running on some issue that could bring you victory, does not really mean that you intend to deliever on that promise. </p>

<p>Your &quot;analaysis&quot; basically just describes how meme&#39;s spread. The only connection you have to the White House, Russia, or Breitbart is 100% pure speculation on your part. No where in here do you prove that the claim of her being a limo liberal is inaccurate, just that it&#39;s a &quot;smear campaign&quot;. The term isn&#39;t new. People have been calling Hillary Clinton and celebrities in Hollywood that for decades.</p>

<p>This entire post is just you trying to justify why this girl is receiving such negative responses from people online and in the right-leaning media. </p>

<p>&quot;It can&#39;t POSSIBLY be for her illogical ideologies that have never and will never work... it must be Trump and Russia!!!&quot;</p>

<p>Get a grip, man.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes I read every word. OP doesn&#39;t &quot;fully admit&quot; that until the very last few paragraphs. This post is titled as an &quot;analysis&quot;, with an opening paragraph that reads:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I have a conspiracy to share with you all <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>. At a minimum, it&#39;s case study on the anatomy of a political smear and how it propagates. Maybe more. I am going to attempt to provide detailed evidence to show that:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>There appears to have been a coordinated effort over the last three days to smear Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez for being a &quot;limousine liberal&quot;.</p>

<p>The smear originates with Breitbart.com. It is not a secret that Breitbart has deep ties to the White House.</p>

<p>The effort to spread it on reddit looks very much like the tactics used by the Russian Internet Research Agency (IRA)</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p>It isn&#39;t until the near the very end that OP, who even <em>recognizes</em>, what they are doing, says:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Nonetheless, I&#39;ll speculate <strong>somewhat irresonsponsibly</strong> on a conspiracy. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I spent a lot of time writing and editting, and chosing my words in the post very carefully.  You are willfully misrepresenting what I wrote.  No where in the highlights you quoted to I assert that the White House is responsible, or that Russia is involved.  The implication is there, and I have insisted here that the reader draw their own conclusions.  </p>

<p>I acknowledged multiple times in that post that there were other explanations, and the evidence of connection to the White House and Russia was weak.  Some direct quotes:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I&#39;ll acknowledge, none of this is terrifically remarkable or even news. This is hardly the first Brietbart smear. There&#39;s no direct evidence the White House had any connection to the smear, and even if they did, the Trump white house wouldn&#39;t be the first to dictate a political attack to favorable media. People are probably sick of hearing the about the Bannon-Trump-Mercer boogeyman. It also is possible that the originator of the smear is Joshua Caplan, the author of the Breitbart article, and the whole thing is perfectly organic.</p>

<p>Having said all of that, there&#39;s less nefarious explanations for the activity from these three accounts, I&#39;m sure. And absolutely, my analysis and evidence doesn&#39;t prove they&#39;re trolls from Russia. </p>

<p>I&#39;ll acknowledge again, there&#39;s no direct link to the White House. And I haven&#39;t at all proven the posts on reddit are coming from Russia.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As you point out, I even characterized speculation on the topic as irresponsible!  You&#39;re free to make up your own mind here, but please stop attacking a straw man.  </p>

<p>LOL yes, because everyone knows Socialism = greater consumer choices. Holy hell. Also, you may want to look up the definition of Capitalism, because whatever bullshit definition you just gave is laughably ignorant. And no, what we currently have is no longer really capitalism, thanks in large part to big government manipulating the shit out of the free market.</p>

<p>See that&#39;s the problem. What you are describing has NEVER worked, because it always inevitably leads to full blown socialism. I&#39;m not saying it&#39;s not possible, but I am saying that anyone who has ever tried it has failed. I&#39;m all for social safety nets, but I don&#39;t believe that is a task for the Federal government.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Here&#39;s my take:</p>

<p>She does play up the Bronx thing, and play down her connection to Yorktown heights.  Just a little bit.</p>

<p>I also think it&#39;s not nearly as nefarious as the propagandists have made it out to be.  She is not a wealthy trust fund kid who was born with a golden spoon in her mouth and grew up with immense privilege.  She grew up in a middle class home with working class parents.  She was actually born in the Bronx.  Yorktown Heights has a higher median income than average, but also a much higher cost of living.  They do indeed have two golf courses, and one of them is a shitty public one.  By no means is it a &quot;wealthy enclave&quot;. </p>

<p>FWIW, I also think the whole question is pretty trivial and unimportant.  What&#39;s more interesting to me is where this smear originated, and how it spread.  </p>

<p>Your entire post boils down to &#39;muh Russian bots propaganda smear campaign&#39;.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>She does play up the Bronx thing, and play down her connection to Yorktown heights.</p>

<p>Which is in complete factual agreement with the alleged &#39;Russian bots propaganda campaign&#39;, though with a less boisterous approach.</p>

<p>I don’t know if that’s the case. I think she has terrible ideas and her policies are naïve and economically illiterate. But Trump won an election based on “Build that wall!” And “Lock her up!” So I really have no clue what voters will do. </p>

<p>I think what&#39;s interesting is that the entire &quot;Bronx Girl&quot; line of attack just doesn&#39;t existing on reddit, at all, without the coordinated propaganda effort.  It originates on Brietbart, and the initial dissemination of the attack on reddit is done exclusively by suspicious accounts that appear to be trolls.  </p>

<p>I kinda thought Breitbart was mostly done since Bannon crossed Trump but your post has me rethinking that thought. I hope they aren’t back leading up to 2020 like they were in 2016. They’re is definitely something bad going on there. </p>

First off, you had to scroll super far in the list to actually get to the ones that were at all prolific posters, where there were only a tiny handful. If you actually look at those accounts, they just shut posted bad memes on the Donald that got almost no traction. There was no competent or effective Russian campaign to effect the 2016 election through social media. That shirtless Bernie is all that people can point to is incredibly telling. Second, it’s apparent exactly what’s going on in this case. Hypocritical establishment Democrats are just pearl clutching and smearing because they are afraid.

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t really think it&#39;s a smear campaign per say.  I believe that Ocasio-Cortez absolutely was trying to get empathy and political points by inferring that she grew up in the hard knock Bronx. You can&#39;t really say that you grew up in a place if you moved out when you were 5.</p>

<p>Regardless of the golf course controversy on Wiki, Westchester county, where she spent the majority of her childhood, is a very wealthy, upper class county in the top 10 wealthiest counties in the country.</p>

<p>Let&#39;s say however that it is actually an organized smear campaign by the right. What would be the purpose of doing so?  The district she won the primary in, is very solidly a Democrat district, with almost no chance of a Republican ever winning, regardless of a sophisticated smear campaign.</p>

<p>In fact, a smear campaign by Republicans is going to have the opposite effect, making her that much more popular with her base, so I don&#39;t really see what a smear campaign would accomplish.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think Bernie was an actual Democratic Socialist in his younger years, but as he got into politics, he became more of a Euro style social democrat.  That&#39;s still farther left than most of the Overton window in America, but still nowhere near as left as the notable Democratic Socialists of the past like Eugene V. Debs, or Alice Paul.  </p>

<p>Since Bernie&#39;s run, I think a lot of people have come to define &quot;Democratic Socialist&quot; as basically, the politics of Bernie Sanders.  I don&#39;t think that&#39;s necessarily bad, but I do recognize the difference.  </p>

<p>As for the white supremacy movement, I agree it&#39;s small (though much larger than Antifa which gets far more coverage than its membership warrant) however, as someone who was born in, raised in, and still live in the rural South, racists (who sympathize with, but may or may not be involved with the movement) are legion.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Good investigative work. Have you considered that they needn&#39;t be Russian to be paid trolls? Remember that the Russia talking point was started by the Clinton campaign and the DNC to distract and deflect from the content of the WikiLeaks that exposed them for working against the Sanders campaign. While stating that it&#39;s obvious Russia had <em>some</em> effect on the election, can we acknowledge they aren&#39;t the only ones capable of paying trolls – especially when Correct the Record has admitted to paying people to push back online?</p>

<p>Tl;dr: this definitely seems like an organized troll campaign, but the GOP – or forces wishing to keep the Democratic party in its current hands – could also be behind it.</p>

<p>As for her political foes, I believe there are more in the Democratic Party&#39;s current seat-holders that qualify for that distinction than anyone on the right or alt right that would simply scoff at any avowed &quot;socialist&quot; simply on the basis of that alone. What needs to be said beyond that coming from her own lips from their perspective?</p>

<p>You can&#39;t, however, say the same about all the Dems who&#39;ve campaigned on the left but generally ruled on right once they were elected much to the ongoing dismay of a steadily increasingly number of disaffected and disenfranchised Dem supporters, especially among all the younger ones. </p>

<p>The ones who all rallied behind Bernie simply because he happened to be the only so-called socialist with some definitely left wing principles and policies he&#39;s stood by for years. </p>

<p>Better if Bernie had been lot younger, more dynamic, and dare I say it, another <em>female</em> in the run-off against Clinton. All of which Ms. Ocasio-Cortez just happens to be. </p>

<p>She&#39;s a promising future candidate with a strong grass-roots support that&#39;s presented and championed what is hoped to be an authentic leftist position. Not only that but she beat one of the &quot;old boys&quot; in the old boys&#39; network that was presumed to be a sure fire winner based on that background of his. Obviously that upsets a whole lot of people among the Dems that thought that they could count on that or perish the thought that it might be the start of a trend of some kind.</p>

<p>So I wouldn&#39;t be too quick trying to blame anyone else looking to put her down given that present state of affairs or the tendency of those very people to blame Russians or the so called alt right for failures that the public had very good reasons for visiting upon their heads.</p>
