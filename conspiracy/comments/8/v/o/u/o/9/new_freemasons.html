<p>The problem is that they are a &quot;Secret society&quot; they aren&#39;t handing out pamphlets to everyone walking into Walmart. Ive pointed you in the right direction but that&#39;s the best I can do for you, you&#39;ll need to keep digging on your own. Good luck friend.</p>

<p>That&#39;s my conclusion as well. The annunaki or watchers or whatever you want to call them are often shown as serpent-like, in many depictions across cultures and time, and there were ancient cults that believed that had received hidden knowledge from them, and formed mystery religions to conceal it.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Often, people will find one fragment of this complex web of secret societies and globalist organizations and look no further, or assume this is where the trail ends, however the further you research the matter the more you realize it&#39;s far more complicated than one would be led to believe initially. For example, there are those who believe only the Vatican, Jesuits or Sovereign Military of Malta have power, while in reality the SMOM, Jesuits, and to lesser extent the Vatican have been inducted as intermediates of the elite, beginning with the former up to the latter. There are also no shortage of those that believe that Zionists alone are among the elite, when again they are merely a faction of intermediates serving the agenda, and often utilized as a means for the elite to deflect scrutiny or criticism by branding their opposition as &#39;racists&#39; or &#39;antisemites&#39; when neither is the case (at least, a majority of the time). Nor do any of the aforementioned groups account for organizations like the Bilderberg Group, Trilateral Commission, Council on Foreign Relations, Rhodes-Milner Round Table Group, Pilgrims Society, Skull &amp; Bones Society, Bohemian Club, Jason Society, Club of Rome, Tavistock Institute, Fabian Society, nor the alleged Committee of 300 and Council of 13, and their influence if not outright control (in some instances) over segments of our society both nationally and internationally.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>To answer your question I would guess that the bilderberg group is probably calling the shots. Or at least that&#39;s what they want us to believe. I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if were actually a group like the Order of the Garter, the Thule society or the Knights of Malta that were actually pulling the strings. </p>

<p>Then again it could be the Freemasons.  What a better way to openly mock society by using the Masons? People think they are weak, which means they are actually more than likely very strong. It&#39;s just too complex to single out one group, they all work together.</p>

To say &quot;it&#39;s the masons, it&#39;s the jesuits, it&#39;s the jews&quot;, is simply always wrong. Different people interpret these teachings different ways and most likely organize with similarly minded folks besneath the very noses of fellow members.

    <div class="md"><p>At the entry level of the organizations I would agree. The members have their own ideas and expectations of what the organization can do for them. </p>

<p>Just using Masonry for  an example.  Once a certain level has been reached more &quot;light&quot; is shown to them. Now they understand how information is compartmentalized or hidden as to throw the unworthy into confusion. </p>

<p>An example I&#39;ve read about said that lower ranking Mason were told to spit on a crucifix as a test. If the wouldn&#39;t do it they were told great job and from that point on they were basically shut out of opportunities to advance. If they did spit on it, they would be told great job, but now they were allowed to advance up the ranks. The information is layered and symbols can have different meanings depending on what degree the member is.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know about every single society, so yes, I was incorrect when I said they all are working for the same cause. But it is true that the Masons, the Jews and the Crypto Jews in the Jesuits do have the same agenda. They are all preparing the world for the return of the Jewish Messiah. As far as the countless other groups I can&#39;t say for sure what their plans are but I&#39;m sure they have something to do with power, wealth and control.</p>
