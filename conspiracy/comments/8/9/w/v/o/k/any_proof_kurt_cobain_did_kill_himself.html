Not crazy, just telling facts. I once though he commuted suicide too.</p>

<p>After looking at all that crazy evidence nobody spread around, what evidence is there he actually did kill himself? Really wanna know the truth to the death of one of my idols. Thank you</p>

Just because you write about stuff like that doesn’t mean he did it. He JUST had a child too, so I’m thinking he was at the last place in his life where he’d do such a thing - even though he was high as a kite. But again, too high to be able to kill yourself with a gun.</p>
