    <div class="md"><p>It’s like hello idiots. You can clearly see a bunch of crazed leftists in the video attacking his car with baseball bats and chasing after him, but suddenly you are Hitler if you even dare say that both sides were responsible. The truth is one side was responsible for the destruction that happened that day because they could not bear to accept the 1st amendment. The white nationalist group had a permit to protest, and ANTIFA just showed up because they wanted violence. There may have been paid provocateurs on both sides hired by the Deep State and the cops may have been told to stand down but I truly believe 95% of the blame should go to the left wing nut jobs that hate free speech </p>

<p>Uh, <strong>after</strong> he ran it into a crowd of people, yes. It&#39;s called self-defense.</p>

<p>Nope, it was revoked before any of the action began, and they defied the police order to disperse. It was declared an unlawful assembly at 11:40.</p>

<p>Try to hide your disdain for fat women for just a moment and think about the fact that you&#39;re claiming she <em>coincidentally</em> died of a heart attack <em>at the same time</em> as she was <strong>being hit by a car.</strong></p>

<p>Besides, does it even matter? If zero people died, would that change the fact that a guy accelerated his car into a crowd of people? It&#39;s analogous to spraying a machine gun into a crowd of people, it&#39;s intent to murder, period.</p>

<p>Are you insane? The car had already accelerated down half the entire block at that point, which you&#39;d hear if this person hadn&#39;t deceptively edited out the sound so you can&#39;t hear the engine roaring.

<p>No, there&#39;s no evidence anyone pointed a rifle at him. At most, someone claiming to be with Redneck Revolt claimed to &quot;wave&quot; a rifle at him (not point, very different gestures).</p>

<blockquote>
<p>And this occurred on 4th street which is 1 block form the incident site?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>More lies from you. Justice Park is 3 blocks from the crash site, and Fields accelerated in the video a block and a half away from Justice Park, where you seem to think he was spooked by a pasty nerd waving a rifle from a distance.</p>

<p>He <strong>began accelerating</strong> <em>a block and a half away</em> from Justice Park. This is where the videos take place and you can hear him beginning to accelerate in the videos. Justice Park is where the guy claims he &quot;chased him off&quot; with a gun (he never said &quot;pointed the gun at him&quot; like you keep repeating). The crowd he struck was a full three blocks from the southmost edge of Justice Park.</p>

<p>Sorry bud, but this guy had nothing to do with the Neo-Fascist scumbag murdering that woman. He did it probably because he was a hateful prick who was sitting in alt right discord channels for months fantasizing about running over protestors, like alt righters do all the time. Hell, it was a trope for years every time a news story came out about BLM blocking a highway or something, instantly cue up a dozen alt righters talking about how they&#39;d run them over given the chance. Then they joke about throwing leftists out of helicopters or lining them up to be shot. Surprise surprise, one of them finally took it all to heart.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>You can invent whatever specifics you want in your head, but the video evidence is clear. When James <em>started accelerating</em> he was already a block and a half away from Justice Park. At the moment he was starting to accelerate, he was in a relatively empty street. Straight ahead of him was a large crowd of people. </p>

<p>He was trying to kill people. Surprise surprise, a guy who was running with a crowd of Nazis and Klansmen who were chanting such wonderful slogans as, <a href="https://youtu.be/zcoYKuoiUrY?t=2524">&quot;Gas the kykes! Race war now!&quot;</a> turned out to have a taste for violence. It doesn&#39;t help that alt right people love fantasizing about running over protesters ever since BLM blocked a highway once. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>he &quot;waved&quot; a gun at a guy. He doesn&#39;t say that the guy did anouther loop after that. He says after that he murdered Heather Myer. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Three blocks away at the least, that&#39;s assuming the waving happened at the very southmost edge of Justice Park and assuming Fields was on the west side when he saw the gun being waved, all very precise assumptions...but none are sufficient enough to explain not accelerating until he was a block and a half away on an uncrowded street facing a much-more crowded street.</p>

<p>And, really, he was looping multiple times past the Redneck Revolt group, so he knew they had guns. If he was such a scaredy cat, why would he keep circling and circling, and why would a <em>wave</em> send him into a panic? A panic which, strangely enough, doesn&#39;t set in until he&#39;s already a block and a half away?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Do you have evidence that gun waving happened 3 blocks from the crash site?</p>

<p>The crash site is 3 blocks from Justice Park, where the &quot;waving&quot; happened. Look at the map.</p>

<p>I&#39;m a Canadian, but that&#39;s besides the point. If you think the US government set this whole thing up then that&#39;s on Trumps watch and as much as I think he&#39;s a shitty person and shitty president I don&#39;t think his administration or any DNC or RNC people set this up.</p>

<p>His unwillingness to condemn open neo nazis, who drove in out of state and brought shields and weapons, was horrid. The whole &quot;both sides&quot; meme is just a way to make neo-nazis more PC and palatable </p>

<p>The reason why it is lying instead of twisting facts is because of the inclusion of the words &quot;in the video&quot;, because that is not what the video shows. </p>

<p>Im not sure which block on 4th street it occured, but the gun waving and the incident occured on the same street.</p>

<p>As for him slowly driving around, the streets were filled with coutner protesters who were blocking intersections. Maybe he was driving around because his vehicle was blocked in and he was looking for an exit and the antifa guy mistook the situation?</p>

<p>All I know is that the media went 100% all in on &#39;terror attack&#39; &#39;car attack&#39; when &#39;traffic accident&#39; is possible. Probable when you factor in that if he wanted to kill people he would have hit a parked car first</p>

<p>The only thing we can be sure that happened that day is the cops let it go way too far and basically allowed that shit to get messy. Why? On whose orders?

    <div class="md"><p>The crowd was not blocking traffic on 4th Street. The 4th Street crossing on to the Downtown Mall had an (easily driven around) barrier erected. Cars were not supposed to be on the 4th Street crossing at all and pedestrians were allowed to be there. </p>

<p>The 4th Street crossing was no longer manned by police because the CPD officer at that position chickened out and asked to leave earlier, according to the Heaphy Report. The CPD officer was a school resource officer who had been out on medical leave for months and this was actually her first day back on the job. VSP offered their officers to man the intersections but CPD chief Al Thomas refused that offer in favor of posting a combination of unprepared officers and non-police staff at those locations. This was part of a pattern of behavior by Thomas, who failed to coordinate properly with VSP.</p>

<p>As to why a crowd was allowed to block traffic on Water Street, it was because ordinary traffic was all gone from downtown since everyone local knew to stay the hell away. State and local police were choosing their battles that day. If a crowd of protesters marched down a street for a few minutes, police didn&#39;t much care. They couldn&#39;t very well make mass arrests for that after standing back and watching people being beaten in the streets for over an hour earlier that day. The smart move was to let them march and chant down the street for a few minutes, knowing that they&#39;d disperse quickly enough on their own.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hi, foremost expert on 8/12 weighing in here. Dixon never left Justice Park and the edge of the park. I spent days reviewing video (I have the motherlode of 8/12 video, having produced a documentary about the day) and he never leaves. Note that 4th Street runs along Justice Park.</p>

<p>So far, I can&#39;t substantiate that Dixon is telling the truth. Note that there was a gun metal grey Ford Mustang parked on 4th or 5th Street near Justice Park and Dixon could have mistaken it for Fields&#39; Charger after the fact. I&#39;ve watched the video shown in court at Fields&#39; preliminary hearing (I was in the front row) of Fields driving slowly towards the Downtown Mall, then backing up a long ways, hanging back near Market Street, and then flooring it towards the crowd. That video isn&#39;t online -- only the lawyers have it. </p>

<p>If Fields did indeed pass by Dixon by Justice Park, that would have been a few minutes earlier. Before he approached the crowd, backed up, and drove towards everyone. It wasn&#39;t a situation where Dixon could have waved the gun at him and he floored it out of panic at that moment. Nobody was hassling him where he was backed up on 4th near Market Street. </p>

<p>The detail to watch is that Dixon has a near-doppelganger whom a lot of people have mistaken for Dixon in video following the crash. Different hat and the guy&#39;s head is not shaven, but otherwise he&#39;s a dead ringer for Dixon. That confusion has probably led to a lot of the mistaken analysis going on.</p>

<p>FBI has loads of location data from Fields&#39; phone and the various apps that were running so we&#39;re going to find out about all the wheres and whens at trial.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>4th Street runs along Justice Park. Dixon spent a lot of time standing at the corner entrance of the park facing 4th Street along with other Redneck Revolt members -- there&#39;s loads of video of that. But it is blocks away from the scene of the crash. If you&#39;ve never actually been to Charlottesville then this might be tough to visualize, but I walk by these spots almost every day and there is no line of sight from the spot along 4th Street at the park where Dixon was positioned and the site of the crash.</p>

<p>So Dixon isn&#39;t necessarily lying when he says that he was technically on 4th Street when he at least thinks he saw Fields. But that is a good ways off from where the actual accident happened and it would have had to be <em>before</em> Fields drove towards the crowd, backed up, paused, and then drove in to the crowd. Dixon was well out of sight of Fields during the pause before he drove into the crowd.</p>

<p>Are you convinced James Fields is a murderer? A terrorist?</p>

<p>Do you deny that its possible that within a short span of time some waved a gun at james fields, he accelerated away, he braked, someone swung a baseball bat at his car, he accelerated and  killed someone? If so why?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I do not know what was going on in James Fields&#39; mind and I cannot speak to his motives on August 12th. His actions effected an act of murder, but I don&#39;t know what his motive was and labeling his action as terrorism presupposes a motive that publicly available evidence cannot support at this time. </p>

<p>Objects were definitely swung at his car after he impacted the crowd, but there is no evidence that he was threatened immediately before he drove into the crowd. The only time he could possibly have had a weapon brandished at him before driving into the crowd was at a time when he had an array of exit routes. It was after he left the vicinity of that person, passing up other clear routes to drive through, that he paused, backed up, paused again, and then directed his vehicle into the crowd. During the time when he was backed up almost to Market Street, Dixon was something like 3 blocks away and out of sight and Fields could have driven in either direction down Market Street to leave the area in his vehicle rather than plowing at high speed into the crowd that was clearly visible to him.</p>

<p>Even Dixon only says that he brought his weapon to the ready position. I&#39;m skeptical that this actually took place. I&#39;ve seen other incidents captured on video of Dixon seeing other alt-right people driving past that spot and he did not brandish his weapon, though people with him shouted at or taunted the people driving by. Nor do I find it plausible that Dixon could have identified Dixon as alt-right. Dixon was an unremarkable person in a white shirt driving a car with heavily tinted windows. Dixon was at Justice Park during the entire riot and could not have recognized Fields from the riot/rally.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not judging Fields. I observe what happened and I report on it. Passing judgement is very rarely within the scope of what I do.</p>

<p>I&#39;ll go you one farther and tell you that people were throwing rocks at his car before he backed up. I got that in an interview on scene about 10 minutes after the crash. But the people who were throwing rocks and yelling at him did not follow his car after he backed up (video showed at his preliminary hearing shows that). Fields could have turned back on to Market Street at that point if he was trying to escape them. </p>

<p>All of this will be shown at his trial -- Fields has an extremely good lawyer working on his behalf.</p>

<p>If you have a link to video that people should see then by all means post it. </p>

<p>In the first 3 seconds of this video. At this point he hasn&#39;t hit anyone. At exactly 3 seconds someone strikes his car with a baseball bat. Before the crash occurred.</p>

<p>Just put yourself in the guys shoes. Your decked out in antifa gear and there is a huge crowd of nazis. Seconds before this video starts a man waves a gun rifle at you in a hostile way and you accelerate to get away. People start screaming. Someone hits your car with a bat</p>

<p>There&#39;s an alternative explanation to what happened, and that&#39;s a panicking person in fear of their safety making bad choices. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The car is already going full-speed into the crowd at that point. The time for anything exculpatory needs to be before that point in a court of law. And it is possible that such an exculpatory event happens, but in this video clip that you&#39;ve shown it&#39;s too late for anything to get James Fields off from his charges.</p>

<p>Let go of your predispositions. Look at the evidence without hoping to prove one thing or another. That is how the jury will examine this and that is the best way to understand what took place. What happened is what happened, and that is apart from what any of us hope or think what might have happened.</p>
