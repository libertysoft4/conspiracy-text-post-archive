    <div class="md"><p>This story is being supressed. My other post was off the front page in minutes</p>

<p>Reddit isnt allowed to know this, because it goes agaisnt the narrative that waht happened was an attack and murder. They are suppresing the fact that Antifa admits to &quot;waving&quot; a gun at James Fields</p>

<p>The fucking media is 100% in line with Antifa. Antifa is their useful idiots and the media protects them. Antifa is the pupper, citibank is the hand</p>

<p>Judge by who the establishment supports and who the establishment targets</p>

<p>Is there a single post about dwayne dixon that hasnt immiedtly gone negative?</p>

<p>The establishment is protecting antifa. The establishment and antifa narratives and motivations are identical.</p>

<p>Almost no one know about this because it is being censored heavily.</p>

<p>You can talk about sinclair all you want and no one will suppress you. Even Israel and its not bad. But mention this and an army of downvotes within minutes. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>the narrative is that James fields intentional plowed into a crowd to murder people.</p>

<p>I&#39;m saying its possible he was spooked when someone point a gun at his vehicle, he panicked and accelerated and caused a traffic accident striking people in an intersection. I&#39;m saying its possible that he had no plan to murder people and it was an accident.</p>

<p>If you were in a car, and antifa pointed a gun at you, would you accelerate quickly? And perhaps in your rush to get away from the guy waving a gun at you perhaps get in a traffic accident?</p>

<p>Do you think it was murder? a terror attack like CNN says?</p>
