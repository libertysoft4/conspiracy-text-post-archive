<p>The goal is not to cover the hurt parts of ourselves back up, the goal is to enter our pain fully and heal it. Follow the crippling anxiety. Feel it until you fully digest it. Then you are forever free of that particular anxiety and have grown to a new level of self-actualization/self-mastery </p>

<p>Can psychedelics assist in opening one&#39;s mind? Yes.</p>

<p>Are they necessary to do so? No.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think its BP is 165c. or 350f. or so. You vaporizor should work fine. The dan tians are far superior to the chakras and are deeper and more fundamental and they themselves are conscious living being that are within you and you can merge with and experience their level of reality, and also when you reach god tier dimension through multidosing lsd with dmt and iboga then the body stops breathing and chi automatically starts breathing and enliving the body on its own and with the afterglow from the trip with the chi still pumping through thr dan tians you reach inedia where you dont need to eat and are sustained by the chi (they call it Bigu in QiGong) and I didn&#39;t eat anything for 3 weeks besides water and was in optimal energy levels juts knew intuitively to enter into a fast to purify the dan tians and the chi starts pumping even more when you are in afterglow post fast stage </p>

<p>UDT is the center of sentience but it has to be awakened in enters into halo expanded state and light and then connects to the heart which science shows has brain neurons as well as the gut having brain neurons and is also LDT and all 3 of these are living sentience that exist in their own dimensions when awakened with their own intelligence that is completely way beyond transcending everything that is status quo existence like basically you enter such heightened sensitivty to tap water being poisoned w fluoride and non-organic foods, wifi, tv signals, cell signals and its literally only in the woods you are safe and connected to the tree/nature energy creates a feedback loop by giving out a nature based chi that interacts and pumps the dan tian chi with its own so you are connected to nature consciousness and the elements and spirits that exist with the forest. People dont even think any of this is possible but the psychdelics open up matrix like movie type unfathomable realities and aspects of your being like the subconscious that most dont even have access too  </p>

<p>I&#39;m not sure if u/beardbrawn is right, that 
u/OT-GOD-IS-DEMIURGE is pulling your leg. But when OT says things like this:</p>

<p>&quot;...the mega supreme trip beyond time and space which constitutes 10 LSD tabs,..&quot;</p>

<p>And then this:</p>

<p>&quot;People dont even think any of this is possible but the psychdelics open up matrix like movie type unfathomable realities and aspects of your being like the subconscious that most dont even have access too&quot;</p>

<p>That shit is just asking for some potentially serious trouble.</p>

<p><a href="/u/OT-GOD-IS-DEMIURGE">/u/OT-GOD-IS-DEMIURGE</a>,</p>

<p>Gtfo with that shit. Even working your way up with years of safe trip, doing that much LSD, especially adding DMT to the  mix, is asking for trouble. Especially if you get fixated on bullshit like the second quote. LSD will not give you fucking matrix powers but taking 10 doses and fixating on some fairytales some stranger told you online is a good way to wind up jumping off a building or frying your brain or giving yourself a heart attack or a stroke overheating and on and on and on. This is not the kind of advice that should be given out lightly or too strangers online and it&#39;s not the kind of thing anyone should say to try and troll someone for lulz. OT, c&#39;mon man, either that&#39;s a shitty trol or shitty advice, period.</p>

<p>Other than working your way up, OT didn&#39;t give out one bit of advice on harm reduction and/or how to set yourself up for a safe trip, like make sure and hydrate, don&#39;t get caught up tryng to extend your trip past the first dose, don&#39;t keep more tabs or drugs and alcohol were you can get to them too easily, make sure you are in a safe environment with friends, make sure you don&#39;t have access to car keys, make sure you don&#39;t get naked in public, consider having an experienced &quot;trip-sitter&quot; with you, etc. etc. I&#39;d advise skipping the LSD all together and going for a very low dose of mushrooms from a proven source unless your LSD source is rock solid and the dosage undeniably small if you are in-experienced.</p>

<p>Make sure and cement it in your brain that while drugs may expand your consciousness and open the doors of mental perception, no drugs will ever give you super powers. There is always an equal and opposite reaction to everything. While you may feel your consciousness expanding with psychedelics in particular, you also have to deal with impared judgement and hallucinations while making what could be life altering decisions.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So basically total disregard for the safety of the person to whom you were apparently try to help find enlightenment. So whether that person may be a child, or emotionally unstable and immature or just have a biological intolerance to the chemicals you recommend you only gavr the most cursory of warnings and only after I prompted you too and then you doubled down on your own ignorance because you&#39;re such an enlightened tough guy and who cares the advice you gave (not someone else) to a stranger online, without you having any forethought whatsoever of the consequences and the fact there very well could be a direct line from that shitty advice to the person who received it jumping off a fucking building. If that happens, oh well, psychedelics are just &quot;self-filtering&quot; right?

<p>You&#39;re no sage OT. You are being ridiculously stubborn and you sound a bit fucking unhinged to be honest. Yes OT, I know what the fuck I&#39;m talking about when it comes to this shit.

Just because you blew your brains out on DMT and LSD and saw the big bang and shook hands with a fucking monkey doesn&#39;t give you the right of way to give others advice that could devestate their life with a near complete disregard for their safety, especially under the guise of trying to help people find enlightenment, not to mention &quot;matrix like movie type unfathomable realities.&quot; Go home rookie.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;I don&#39;t share my recipe experiences with no one except consenting adults who have already had prior experiences w these substances.&quot;</p>

<p>So you and u/pokeurmom (note the username) have had prior exchanges where you established that this person was indeed somewhat experienced already and prepared for the advice you gave here: </p>

<p>&quot;You work way up from microdosing to full dosing and then to multiple at the same dosing and when you reach those thresholds and your mental construct navigation map sequence mind generator adapts to the modus operandi of deminsions you have traveled into, then you start titrating your lsd with ever increasing amounts of DMT crystals...&quot;</p>

<p>And here:</p>

<p>&quot;you have to also source out Iboga and incorporate the mega supreme trip beyond time and space which constitutes 10 LSD tabs, a mega dose of Iboga,..&quot;</p>

<p>Here too:</p>

<p>&quot;...when you vaporize the correct temp DMT crystals which sends you to the Ultimate dimension...&quot;</p>

<p>And another:</p>

<p>&quot;I think its BP is 165c. or 350f. or so. You vaporizor should work fine.&quot;</p>

<p>Here&#39;s more say advice:</p>

<p>&quot;...also when you reach god tier dimension through multidosing lsd with dmt and iboga then the body stops breathing and chi automatically starts breathing and enliving the body on its own...&quot;</p>

<p>And of course this doozy:</p>

<p>&quot;People dont even think any of this is possible but the psychdelics open up matrix like movie type unfathomable realities and aspects of your being like the subconscious that most dont even have access too&quot;</p>

<p>And you did it all on an open sub Reddit again, without so much as a warning that what you were talking about will knock even the most experienced drug user flat on their ass until I did it for you. Even if you had prior contact with the person you were talking to, which I highly doubt, what about all the other people reading?</p>

<p>I&#39;m not even gonna bother waiting the rest of the last comment you made to explicitly point out how ridiculous you sound, but suffice it to say, you deciding that this whole thing is a &quot;sim&quot; and that kids won&#39;t have access to this shit or they will be afraid or telling me that someone dying seems like the end of the world, when I&#39;m not the one giving out potentially deadly advice and it&#39;s the loved ones of the people you are giving advice to that will be the ones who think it&#39;s the end of the world if your advice results in tragedy.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You are God and you are using your own sentience to sit on reddit and argue with others. He is speaking about using your sentience to &quot;upgrade&quot; your own DNA (in whatever way you allow yourself to be &quot;upgraded&quot;)</p>

<p>You can literally do this all with meditation, psychedelics can help break you open, but there&#39;s no point in repeat openings if you haven&#39;t learned how to handle it while sober. </p>

<p>&quot;you deciding that this whole thing is a sim and that kids won&#39;t have access to this shit or they will be afraid or telling me that someone dying seems like the end of the world but it really isnt is fucking beyond ridiculous.&quot;</p>

<p>You are creating these &quot;endangered kids&quot; in your reality simply by thinking and KNOWING they &quot;exist&quot; somewhere, here, in this plane with you. This is how powerful YOU (the big you) are.... (ignore your little mind that bashes its head against its own walls of logic/belief)</p>

<p>You are using your sentience to create fear. I would suggest creating love and enthusiastic joy :)</p>

<p>That&#39;s &quot;my&quot; goal for now; learn to enjoy this experience and transmute fears back into raw information that can be discarded. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not the one that asked for advice. Try reading through all the relevant threads first before jumping down my shit next time. Otherwise after you have had a real negative experience with the compounds mentioned then come back and talk to me. Even if you don&#39;t know someone whose life has been turned upside down by psychedelics or know someone who has been injured or died as a result of using these chemicals or know anybody who took this shit regularly before they were even in their teens, or know anybody who was put in a mental institution after overdosing and trying to commit suicide, and I know plenty of the aforementioned mentioned examples personally, all you need to recognize is that I was telling OT to include a warning with his hastily given advice. Anybody who argues against that, with or without proper context, is a fool. I&#39;m all for safe psychedelic experimentation for some people in some circumstances, it can be a great experience when done the right way. The advice OT gave is fucking ridiculous and should not be given out to strangers in a public forum without warning, period. Especially strangers that appear to be inexperienced. </p>

<p>Don&#39;t even get me started as to the irony of your comment warning me to not to take psychedelics too fast when that is exactly the same thing I was chastising OT for not doing with the advice he gave in the first place. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thank you for caring so deeply about the potential harm this could do. </p>

<p>You&#39;re helping me realize we need both aspects to have a meaningful experience here, fearlessness and caution.</p>

<p>Yet, a aspect of my mind keeps saying &quot;You only need caution when you are not filled with Faith in your own sentience&quot;</p>

<p>And yes, that would be far too great a consequence/lesson learned for somebody to completely derail their life just to know what they aren&#39;t ready for or haven&#39;t cultivated enough self-love and faith to experience. </p>

<p>Another aspect of my mind understands the world is terribly overpopulated (or so it seems...)</p>

<p>Maybe &quot;survival of the fittest&quot; is what we need, sooner than later. 
I would prefer we all learn to work together to heal the deep trauma that runs in humanity&#39;s bones. The same trauma that causes these psychedelic experiences to go haywire. It&#39;s a tricky and delicate process indeed. We&#39;re figuring it out as we go, so I thank psychonaughts such as &quot;GOD-IS-DEMIURGE&quot; for attempting to break free and blaze a trail for those who aren&#39;t ready nor capable. And I also thank people such as yourself for making sure we do so intelligently and with caution. </p>

<p>This whole experience is just a game; Time vs. intensity. Ascension is inevitable; but that could be lifetimes or even moments away </p>

<p>The difference between Bone-shattering traumatic experiences and Intelligently-ecstatic Blissful experiences is razor-thin. We are figuring out how to stay on the &quot;high road&quot; while we &quot;walk back&quot; out of Time-Space into the 5th dimension, where our sentience has always, and will always, reside. </p>

<p>Something like that ;)</p>

<p>listen, its simple: I know a lot of people who will take a half or 3/4ths tab or take a quick 10 minute trip into dmt elf realms and after that they are done and dont dare go for break-through. Not a single one. Its not even easy to get lucy, dmt crystials, or iboga</p>

<p>Excellent advice.</p>

<p>I know how difficult it is, but a week without TV, processed foods, and drugs/alcohol will open the eyes and calm the soul of anybody who tries it.</p>

<p>Just one week. We all owe it to ourselves to give our minds and body one week free from toxins. You can always go back to the toxins later, they will be waiting for you. But one week will do wonders.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>They&#39;re a part of one possible solution. Psychedelics allow you to reprogram your brain&#39;s basic operating system, your culture if you will. They can be used for good -- that is, waking somebody up from mind control. Or they can be used for bad -- changing the traditional, family-oriented western culture of the 1950s to its neo-liberal in the 1970s, putting them <em>into</em> mind control.</p>

<p>They&#39;re a powerful tool, and should be respected and used accordingly.</p>

If it&#39;s true it sure would shed light on why tptb want to keep it illegal. Can&#39;t have an all natural compund that anyone can grow in the privacy of their own home undoing all these years of sociatal indoctrination and msm brainwashing undone by a silly little mushroom.
