        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>OK, so I posted this topic last week and I think there is more to &quot;Q&quot; than just Assange. The fact that his internet is cut, then the Great Awakening board is down, makes it seem more and more plausible. As to why the posts continue.... I have also said in the past that I think Bannon, Roger Stone, Assange got together to create this whole deal and I think one of them have picked up the posts once he was cut from internet access. I think they sent out a message the board had been compromised as cover, then picked up the posts. </p>

<p>Does anyone find this disturbing? Take out the fact that this guy is acting as a proxy for the president of the United States. I mean, I wonder how much stuff was given to Assange/Wikileaks during the election that he buried? Things that would have made Trump look bad. You know damn well that he got stuff but since he was Pro-GOP in the election, only DNC/HRC things were leaked. Once the Wikileaks Task Force started leaking their convos with him, I lost all respect for his &quot;showing the truth&quot;. There is an agenda here and it isn&#39;t trying to show that Trump is saving the world. It is to cover Trump&#39;s ass when the shit from his dirt starts hitting the fan.  This whole deal just stinks to me. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This entire post is literally you snowballing one &quot;thought&quot; into the next...most of these thoughts have absolutely 0 factual weight behind them.</p>

<p>Over the past two years, Julian Assange has definitely proven to be a little less apolitical than many of us originally thought, but comparing Assange to &quot;Q&quot; is absolutely ludicrous.</p>

<p>Q is a fucking joke and I would bet the person who made it all up is 18 years old +/- 2-3 years. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is a conspiracy sub right? The only thing that has no factual weight is my assessment that Assange is &quot;Q&quot;. Do you not find it strange that the day after his internet is cut, the page is shut down? </p>

<p>He is a lot less apolitical than many thought? He was blatantly for the GOP in this election, which is why his own circle leaked his convos with them. He was no longer apolitical. </p>

<p>And maybe you are right, I bet Barron Trump is &quot;Q&quot;. </p>
