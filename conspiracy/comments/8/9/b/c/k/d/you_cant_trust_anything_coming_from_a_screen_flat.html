<p>We live in a time where anything can be digitally fabricated. Photographic evidence is worse than useless now.</p>

<p>I’m not a Flat Earther myself (I haven’t seen enough convincing evidence). 
But it’s definitely made me question all my pre-existing assumptions and beliefs.</p>

The ‘evidence’ your looking for is on the side of the flat earthers argument to show a pic of the edge of the earth or the giant ice wall they claim is there. The evidence on the side of popular science, satellites, rockets,  planes etc are clear evidence enough that earth is not flat since it takes incredible math and calculation for these things to exist</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Assumptions and science definitely do not go together. It’s important to realize science is not a noun but a verb.. it is something you do, not a fixated concept. That being said I implore you to read Demon Haunted World by Carl Sagan. He outlines the possibility that it is the failure of critical thinking that allows pseudoscience or divinity to take the place of science. When I look at flat earth theory it is a flimsy premise; for example, they don’t believe in gravity which again would be more work to prove scientifically unless you assign a divine or like you said, assumed role. I tried giving flat earth a chance because I love conspiracy theory. But the nail in the coffin for me was to find the end goal of the theory socially, politically which was ultimately creationist theory. That’s why at the end of those flat earth videos they have biblical scriptures.. I find it unnecessary to involve creationism to the theory but apparently that’s the glue that allows it to side step a lot of practical, proven sciences. Like gravity. </p>

<p>I think it’s Far more likely that this theory like the Mandela effect theory, is merely a symptom of media garbage set on by the modern world. It undermines the intelligence of young minds by trying to scramble and rewire curiosity into skepticism by using pop culture and internet culture against itself. It is dangerous bc you end up shouting at others through a gilded cage. </p>

<p>Ask yourself this: does the Shape
Of the earth determine its fate? To me the same problems exist for humans whether on a sphere or cube. If you find out people think you’re okay looking instead of super hot and attractive does this change what YOU do? No. If you realize you were adopted instead of birthed would that rewrite your achievements or failures? No.. it doesn’t seem reality weighs solely on what we perceive but what we do with what we allow ourselves perceive</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That’s just not true. Every scientific theory has assumptions built in. The less assumptions the more chance of being accurate.
Over the course of history many things were certain, until someone came along and showed otherwise.
If you were to fast forward 100 years it’s entirely possible that we were wrong about a lot of things.</p>

<p>For example look at the assumptions that must be made in order to determine how far away the stars are from us and what elements they contain.
There is so much room for other possibilities.</p>

<p>All that being said, I do have a lot of problems with FE. Most of the info online is so obviously false. But I do know some very smart friends who believe in it.</p>

<p>If you are interested I suggest you look into the curvature of the earth and why we can’t actually observe it.</p>

<p>Unless you do it in multiple locations at the same time... in which case it proves the earth is a sphere and the sun is millions of miles away (possible) or the sun is in multiple places at the same time (impossible).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think you&#39;re merely stating that any theory is an assumption. Which is a logically like saying any choice is an opinion. You see there isn&#39;t much meaning in that argument. Also if any theory is based on what you&#39;re defining as &quot;accurate&quot; it would be in the sciences and math. Again, shooting rockets let alone designing rockets involve an incredible amount of calculated effort on the part of many people to pull off. This would be determined by variable forces as well like the atmosphere and weather. </p>

<p>I think when you say a theory is an assumption it can work in other fields that are creative. Like philosophy, music or the arts.</p>

<p>As far looking into it, as I&#39;ve said I looked plenty into it. But these are my thoughts. I think you could rid yourself of these dilemmas by simply studying more on perception itself and less on the perception of the material world. Why bother with a conspiracy as generalized as FE when you can explore other exciting fields of thought like ontology or epistemology. I promise you those will keep you plenty busy with questions on perception</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No you are missing my point.</p>

<p>I’m not being semantic about the word theory - like how creationists are about the <em>Theory</em> of evolution: “it’s only a theory”.</p>

<p>I’m saying that theories are based on certain assumptions, and sometimes those assumptions are shown to be false and we are back to the drawing board.
Newtonian physics vs special relativity for example.</p>

<p>If we want to question the theory we must first find out which assumptions it makes and question them.</p>

<p>For example, if we found out the actually the speed of light is not a constant, then that would cripple special relativity.</p>

<p>Everyone gets that. We make models to explain the phenomena we see. </p>

<p>Even if you dont believe a single shred of evidence from NASA (Or the dozens of private space companies...) the current globe model is the best most concise model. </p>

<p>Actually I do know why. But even the general public can see planes. Most have been on a plane. Everyone they know has been on a plane and seen them.</p>

<p>It’s not comparable.
The only real evidence that makes people think the earth is round is pictures and videos (which can all be faked).
So it’s really not the same level of belief.
No one knows anyone who has seen that the earth is round. </p>

<p>There&#39;s the pole stars, shipa going over a horizon, 2 different constellations in different hemispheres, 24hr sunlight in certain parts of the world, even sunsets.</p>

<p>Theyre all observations that prove the earth is a globe, <em>especially</em> 2 different constellations of stars and 2 pole stars. Flat earthers have tried to make that work for years on their flat earth model, bit can&#39;t. It&#39;s only possible on a globe.</p>

<p>I’m not too versed in it so feel free to follow up with your own study.
But basically objects will fall or rise to their density level. 
I’m sure you’ve seen the density experiments with water, sugar, mercury etc. Materials with greater density than water will sink, lower density will float.</p>

<p>The FE idea is basically the same except their ‘density’ is what governs everything, not gravity (which they say doesn’t exist)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I haven’t. I heard a lot about it recently. Who Built the Moon is a fun read as well but part of me feels like it’s a bit of a limited hangout. I grew up enthralled with outer space. The Drake equation made me certain there were aliens. I was convinced there is a base on the back of the moon. Now, stepping back, I really have to consider the hoax goes much further than I have considered. So much is CGI, excuses, profit, etc and the hugeeeee amount of shilling for this government agency on a conspiracy forum really makes me pause. The one government entity so closely tied with Hollywood is the one this sub since “nah, they are straight shooters”- it’s just off. The nature of our world is being intentionally hidden from us. So we got to ask, why the lie?</p>

<p>When you start looking into proofs for the globe earth, you start to see that there really aren’t any strong ones that you can actually determine yourself. It’s mostly down to authority.
The curvature test is one of the ones you can do yourself and from my research no one has been able to demonstrate a visible curve.</p>

<p>Again I’m not a FE, but I also do not want to believe things just because everyone else does. That is a mental illness. We need more people with greater critical thinking skills.</p>

<p>If you zoom in using a telescope it reappears.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It’s everywhere.</p>

<p>I’ve just spent some time reading up this because it’s been a while.
So from what I can tell the only examples of the Coriolis effect are on large weather patterns, like cyclones.
I was wrong. They have a tendency depending on which hemisphere they are in.
But it is FALSE that the Coriolis effect works on small scales, like toilet flushes.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The &#39;proof&#39; is all around you.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The problem is that almost everything that is listed as proof, isn’t proof.
It is merely evidence that points to a certain conclusion.
But everyone blindly <em>BELIEVES</em> the earth is a globe, without knowing why.
That’s the big problem I have.</p>

<p>I wish we could just cut to the most relevant points.
FE is an exercise in open-mindedness - and critical thinking for me.</p>

<p>This may come as an eye-opener to you, but in science (with the exception of math), there is no proof. (which is why I wrote &#39;proof&#39;  earlier)<br/>
There is only evidence.<br/>
All science is merely the current best model; Science is impermanent. It is, by definition, in constant flux.
You can never have 100% proof of anything; There will always be doubt.</p>

<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>

<p>So, no.. not everyone believes blindly that the earth is a globe. There is just tons of <em>evidence</em> supporting that notion. Globe earth is the current best model because it works - in all the scientific fields I described earlier.</p>

<p>Only if the penny is always oriented perfectly perpendicular to the direction of the light. </p>

<p>Besides, if the sun is always above the earth... how can the earth cast a shadow on the moon at all? Clearly the sun must drop below the surface of the earth at some point, which is utterly impossible in the flat earth model because we <em>know</em> that the sun is always visible from one part of the surface.</p>

<p>The only way the sun can always be visible from at least one part of the earth, <em>and</em> the earth be able to cast a shadow on the moon, is if the earth is a sphere.</p>

<p>That one simple fact utterly disproves the flat earth model... unless you want to claim the earth isn&#39;t casting a shadow on the moon during a lunar eclipse...</p>

<p>Either you haven&#39;t seen many &quot;debunks&quot; or you have no idea what a &quot;logical fallacy&quot; is.</p>

<p>I challenge you to give an example of one of the logical fallacies you claim to see.</p>

<p>If the earth is flat, it would be impossible for the sun to light clouds from below. Yet I see it on a regular basis with my own eyes.</p>

If you’re going to debunk something it should be solid.
Link me a debunk and I’ll have a look. I’m open to new ideas. I don’t really care about the shape of the earth. More just about thinking critically.</p>

<p>I haven’t looked in that. I’m not copping out. I just don’t know every aspect of the FE theory. What you’re saying does make sense though.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve researched the subject for over 3 years and can not find any actual evidence of a spinning ball Earth.  Once you research the subject and try to prove the ball earth to yourself you will realize how much faith is involved to have that belief system.</p>

<p>Most people have faith in NASA images and research the subject no further.  Others will tell you the big &quot;proof&quot; is the 2000 year old Earstothenes experiment where he had to ASSUME that the Sun was millions of miles away with the light rays all hitting the Earth at the same angle in order to &quot;prove&quot; a ball Earth.  The Sun has been shown and measured to be much closer and smaller.  It is not 95 million miles away and once you realize that it becomes obvious it is not.  </p>

<p>Water will always finds it&#39;s level (i.e. a cup, bath, pool, pond, lake, ocean etc.)  So how can the Earth be over 70% flat, level water??  You have to have more faith in the mysterious force (that attempts to fix all of the heliocentric holes) &quot;gravity&quot; to believe that water is actually stuck to a ball.  There is no model or experiment that can show this is true, you must have more faith that it is true.  </p>

<p>Science should be observable, measurable, and repeatable.  I have found no observable, measurable evidence for curvature or motion of the Earth in 3-4 years of researching.    </p>

<p>Exactly.  Most modern &quot;science&quot; is not repeatable.  For example, take the 1919 experiment that was supposed to prove the General Theory of Relativity (i.e. watching starlight bend around the sun&#39;s gravity).  This shit does not happen and this experiment has not been repeated.  Furthermore, for the General Theory of Relativity to be true there should be trans-dimensional weather.  This shit does not happen either, and the LIGO experiment is complete bullshit.  So, as a working field theory, the General Theory of Relativity is a failure.  They try to shore up their funny math by creating black holes and other strange anomalies like anti-mater rather than admit that the current model is a failure.  So many people have stood on the shoulders of idiots that it is difficult to tell where the idiots start and end.</p>

<p>Someone has pointed to a very simple experiment that can be performed using basic materials.  This is one of many experiments that have concluded there is not curvature to earth.  You will need two boats on a flat body of water traveling in opposite directions with a taunt rope between them; if the rope gets wet at a certain distance that indicates curvature.  I believe this experiment has been done and was conclusive, but you can perform it yourself.  None of the experiments that have been performed are conclusive of a spinning, curved sphere in space.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Absolutely.  If you look into the logistics of the experiment it is a complete joke and would be impossible to differentiate &quot;gravity waves&quot; from other outside variables.  99% of people just see a headline on whatever &quot;science&quot; website and believe it must be true without even questioning the validity of the claim for themselves.  </p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Exactly.  In science if experiments fail you should throw that idea out.  But when experiments fail for the heliocentric model they just create theoretical magical fix it terms like &quot;Dark Matter&quot; in which they even admit they have no idea what it is.  So they have to manufacture terms to explain why over 85+ % of the theory does not work. </p>

<p>Always good to hear others that can think for themselves instead of just assuming the status quo must be correct.  </p>

<p>Go ahead and try it... I guarantee the rope will get wet... but not because the earth is a sphere - it would be because there is no rope in existence in which you could have it be miles long, unsupported and perfectly straight... it&#39;s own weight will bend it down to the surface, or snap it.</p>

<p>Your experimental design is utterly flawed.</p>

<p>I was one of those idiots that was gullible enough to buy into the YouTube videos without using my brain. Did you know the so called Antarctica Treaty is a lie? There&#39;s no proof of the so called magical military patrol that stops you from going to the south pole, yet every flat earther assumes it&#39;s true because a YouTube video told them so. Did you know the &quot;Law of Perspective&quot; is a lie, and the only mention of it you can find is flat earthers talking about their so called &quot;Law&quot;?  </p>

<p>The &quot;Law of Perspective&quot; was fabricated by flat Earthers to explain (poorly) why things disappear over the curved horizon.<br/>
And flat earthers assume it&#39;s true because...a youtube video told them.<br/>

<p>It means if a group of users spend hours a day going into every FE thread to &quot;debunk&quot; a &quot;crazy fringe conspiracy&quot; every single day for years they are not genuine users looking for real discussion.  The have a brigading agenda or are literally insane.  One or the other.  </p>

<p>Proof?<br/>
His character is irrelevant. You can see in the images that you can observe the curvature. And those images aren&#39;t even taken by Mick West.<br/>
Trust me, I spent a long time trying to think about how they&#39;d be possible on a flat earth , but it isnt.</p>

<p>Omg, please stop acting like you were a FE&#39;r. What made you become a FEr if you had never looked at the evidence before?</p>

<p>I was gullible enough to fall for all of those youtube videos :(<br/>
Then I did my own research, actually thought about it, and came to the conclusion we&#39;re on a globe.</p>

<p>For example, the 2 rotational axis, and 2 pole stars. A flat earth would only have one. It&#39;s ONLY possible for what we observe to happen on a globe.  </p>

<p>Do you think I <em>want</em> flat earth to be BS? Everyone would love the earth to be flat, it would confirm the existence of God. But it&#39;s just not true :(</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Isn&#39;t that how FE works? FE works on being ignorant of science and the typical soundbite nonsense, like a plane having to &quot;tip it&#39;s nose down&quot; to account for curvature. If you don&#39;t know how flight works it sounds reasonable.<br/>
Honestly until I did my own research I was really gullible, as was every other flat earther.<br/>
Did you know the &quot;Law of Perspective&quot; doesn&#39;t actually exist? Do a Google search for it and all you&#39;ll find are other flat earthers referencing it, but it&#39;s been fabricated. I, and every other FE&#39;r just accepted the &quot;Law of Perspective&quot; was a thing when I seen it mentioned in a YouTube video without questioning it. Thats a faith based belief system.  </p>

<p>There&#39;s over 2 hours of footage of Soundly viewing it from multiple angles, there&#39;s a visible curvature in all them.</p>

<p>Also the Toronto one with the CN Tower is taken from 50 miles away, that&#39;s definitely enough for a visible curvature. </p>

<p>The Eric Dubay one is a good example. Did you know the &quot;engineers don&#39;t have to account for curvature&quot; is a blatant made up lie? There is an equation that is used to account for the curvature of the earth, and it&#39;s used in suspension bridges (as for longer ones both sides will be slightly bowed out)</p>

<p>There isn&#39;t any proof whatsoever of the so called mythical &quot;Antarctica / UN guard&quot; that magically track everyone going to the north pole.</p>

<p>All the Antarctica Treaty says is no nation can claim Antarctica as their territory. It says nothing about a magic military patrol making it illegal to go there.</p>

<p>You&#39;ve been lied to, and I don&#39;t mean by MASA or da gubbament, I mean you&#39;ve been lied to by flat earthers. Did you also know that the so called &quot;Law of Perspective&quot; they constantly being up doesn&#39;t even exist? If you search for it, all you&#39;ll find are flat Earthers talking about this magical &quot;law&quot; that makes things go over the horizon.<br/>
It was made up to try and explain the flat earth, rather than the other way around. Flat earthers fabricate whatever nonsense they want to try and explain their magic space pizza.</p>

You are allowed to go to certain places, but if you wanted to start at one side, then travel all the way to the other (passing the south pole) you would not be allowed to.</p>

<p>I’m not being semantic about the word theory - like how creationists are about the <em>Theory</em> of evolution: “it’s only a theory”.</p>

Newtonian physics vs special relativity for example.</p>

<p>If we want to question the theory we must first find out which assumptions it makes and question them.</p>

<p>the LIGO experiment is complete bullshit.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Absolutely.  If you look into the logistics of the experiment it is a complete joke and would be impossible to differentiate &quot;gravity waves&quot; from other outside variables.  99% of people just see a headline on whatever &quot;science&quot; website and believe it must be true without even questioning the validity of the claim for themselves.  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>They try to shore up their funny math by creating black holes and other strange anomalies like anti-mater rather than admit that the current model is a failure.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Exactly.  In science if experiments fail you should throw that idea out.  But when experiments fail for the heliocentric model they just create theoretical magical fix it terms like &quot;Dark Matter&quot; in which they even admit they have no idea what it is.  So they have to manufacture terms to explain why over 85+ % of the theory does not work. </p>

<p>Always good to hear others that can think for themselves instead of just assuming the status quo must be correct.  </p>

<p>Go ahead and try it... I guarantee the rope will get wet... but not because the earth is a sphere - it would be because there is no rope in existence in which you could have it be miles long, unsupported and perfectly straight... it&#39;s own weight will bend it down to the surface, or snap it.</p>

<p>Your experimental design is utterly flawed.</p>

But then he recommends Eric Dubay. So many things incorrect with what that guy says.</p>

<p>Either way I heard about FE as a joke a while ago. I started looking into it last year when a very smart friend of mine brought it up. It’s a huge topic and very thought provoking.</p>

<p>They&#39;re told the earth is a ball, they think about it, and they agree, because what we observe matches up with the fact that the earth is a ball.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don’t think there is much that we observe that could tell us the shape of the earth.
If you told everyone from birth that it was flat then anyone coming along saying it was a sphere would face the same ignorance as FEs today experience.
I’m not saying it’s flat. Just that people mostly parrot what they are taught without question.</p>
