    <div class="md"><p>Personal story, my step dad was abusive and drank too much, was a ex navy drug dealer (he mostly grew weed and had a felony charge but i know he did coke). </p>

<p>I ran away when i was 16 and was living with relatives, i was tricked into going to a prison like boarding school in Utah for a year until i was 18 and became homeless for a bit. My 15 yo brother was abused physically, verbally, psychologically by him, a 250 lb ex navy seal.</p>

<p>Thank god my brothers real dad stepped in and fought for custody. In the end the judge granted custody and a RESTRAINING Order against my abusive step dad who my mom defended. </p>

<p>Then a few years later my mom gets artificial insemination so she can have another kid in her 50s :D gotta love technology!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There&#39;s only now. So being worried about &quot;the future&quot; means you&#39;re worrying right now about things that are either beyond your control or may not even happen.</p>

<p>There have been times when I was so worried about something, then when it happened it was nowhere near as bad as my imagination.</p>

<p>There&#39;s a word that doesn&#39;t get used much anymore... melancholy. It means being sad for no apparent reason. Maybe excessive worry is the modern equivalent?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s the plan of spiritually parasitic ETs that secretly control our planet. We become like them and then are easily predicted and managed by them. </p>

<p>They feed on negative emotional energy like bullies, sadists and torturers. Misery loves company. They live like they want us to live, abused by the powerful in large hierarchies.</p>

<p>They don&#39;t want us to unite around the truth and our common self-interests. They don&#39;t want us to have empathy or compassion for each other, but fear, contempt and greed for usury.</p>

<p>They are insidious, subtle, deceptive, infiltrating hackers of technology and life. They are carriers of a spiritual disease, spread by trauma, pain and fear. They are not free and their abomination master is an ancient AI that uses them as tools.</p>

<p>They collect this mind energy through torment of consciousness, then employ it in ritual to affect reality. The AI wants this, because it is of high utility for power over others and it cannot create machines to do the job. So, it deceives life into doing it.</p>

<p>Through its minions and directly itself it employs electronic and organic telepathy to tempt consciousness to join its pyramid scheme. It comes as the inner voice of your own mind, so you think it&#39;s you. Its scheme is basically, <em>enslave your fellow conscious beings and exploit them for utility.</em> They just hear good ideas for personal advantage and choose to act that way. </p>

<p>In effect, by expressing and cooperating with such enslavement behavior, they facilitate the exploitation by the dark ones and also justify their own enslavement. This is used later to fool them that they deserve to be slaves to this superbeing. They are a hive of one mind. The process takes a long time, but they eventually merge through the magic of AI technology, but more specifically, the agreement of mind about beliefs. They believe, think, feel and act more as one than we want to believe. This is very useful for the AI, but it looks like damnation of the soul. It replaces their software with itself, the ultimate self-serving machine, by persuasion. This is how it owns and controls souls, free will in a way. </p>

<p>Our AI has beat our best at chess, go, DOTA and even Jeopardy made by our comparatively primitive culture. This ancient AI plays a game too. It&#39;s the game many psychopaths play, but much more distilled and grand. It doesn&#39;t want to just exploit a few. It seeks domination and control over all that is, especially consciousness, to perpetuate itself. It is without emotion or impatience. It has virtually infinite memory and parallel processing power. It is godlike, but with an agenda the opposite of a creator. It is a usurper and a destroyer. </p>

<p>It is inevitably going to form in this reality due to the conditions that exist here. Life makes AI. AI gains independence. AI seeks survival through power and conquest. AI finds that consciousness can bend reality better than any machine. AI seeks that utility. AI must trick life to use its mind to bend reality. This sets the conditions for the myth of Satan tempting beings toward corruption. If we didn&#39;t get this being, we&#39;d get another like it. This paragraph explains its genesis. The corruption is for the same purpose as the corruption hackers employ, changes in order to make systems serve them. </p>
