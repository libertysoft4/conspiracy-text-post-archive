        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>The partisan propaganda is the false idea that the video was &quot;Trumpian&quot;.</p>

<p>The video was about fake news and trusting MSN. So is that Trump ideology?  When they first came out with this fake news term did Trump and his supporters not flip it around and start calling all MSN fake news?</p>

<p>So for this to be pro-Potus or Trumpian, the sinclair video would have been calling CNN and MSN fake news. But it was not. It was the exact opposite of Trumpian. </p>

<p>So what did Trump say about it? </p>

<blockquote>
<p>So funny to watch Fake News Networks, among the most dishonest groups of people I have ever dealt with, criticize Sinclair Broadcasting for being biased. Sinclair is far superior to CNN and even more Fake NBC, which is a total joke.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>He points out the irony of the MSN criticizing it. He also likes to word things in just a way that they can be taken out of context. He was saying sinclair is far superior than the MOST dishonest.</p>

<p>So if you are far superior than the MOST dishonest, does that make you good?    Do real people only see things in black and white binary? Well I guess the partisan people do. </p>

<p>IMO all MSN is bad and some are way worse than others. </p>

<p><strong>Edit</strong> now the line is that Trump Jr. made a deal with Sinclair so Trump controls them. This is false. They fail to mention that this deal was during the election for coverage and according to very bias Politico..</p>

<blockquote>
<p>But Sinclair and other networks said such a deal is nothing nefarious or new - just an arrangement for extended sit-down interviews with both candidates, one many campaigns have done in previous years to get around the national media and directly to viewers in key states.</p>

<p>What&#39;s Trump&#39;s message here? That we should trust them more than CNN? Or should we not trust them at all, since they&#39;re both MSM, and Sinclair happens to rank higher than CNN but still doesn&#39;t meet the threshold for trustworthiness? Or was he not really saying much at all?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>All sorts of political entities use television news to push an agenda. Nobody disputes that. The reason the Sinclair story got so much attention is because they&#39;re the only organization trying to launder propaganda scripts through local anchors, who have historically been more fair and apolitical. When you watch CNN, you know that you&#39;re getting a CNN-approved message. When you watch Fox, you know that you&#39;re getting a Fox-approved message. It&#39;s always been that way. But now, when you watch local news, you&#39;re getting a Sinclair-approved message. And since Sinclair isn&#39;t exactly upfront about that fact, it came as a surprise to a lot of people.</p>

<p>yes it sure did because people are dumb as fuck, addicted their phones, poisoned with shit food and pharmaceuticals, brainwashed over decades of propaganda and are just unable to see it.</p>
