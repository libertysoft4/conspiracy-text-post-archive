        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>There&#39;s a strange <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCUSIHjvc27bOouhmbMfA2EQ/videos">channel</a> called &quot;Man Gled&quot; which has been uploading bizarre videos for several years now, usually only around holidays. </p>

<p>After months of waiting, two new videos were posted, showing footage from 2006 being shot primarily outside, but with some shots focusing on structures and interiors. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iwB7KqspmJU">THIS</a> is the most recent upload and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BbaYerK9J5Q">THIS</a> is the slightly older one.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve been working with a rather large group of investigators to solve these videos, and right now we&#39;re trying to see if we can track down the locations seen in this video (though that&#39;s hard to do since we see so little in them), crack potential codes, identify the voices heard, etc. </p>

<p>Any help would be appreciated. And if you&#39;re interested in joining our group, send me a private message and I can link you to our discord chat.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sorry if it comes across that way. Our discord group is a real thing with around 50 members right now, and I only got involved a couple years ago. There&#39;s other people who&#39;ve been at it way longer than me. Some going back since 2013. Further evidence shows this whole thing&#39;s sort of been going on since 2009.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The videos appear to be outlining someone going through a grieving process over the death. We aren&#39;t sure if it&#39;s a family member of Brett, or a friend, but we&#39;re definitely getting that sort of dower and depressed vibe from some of the codes we solve. </p>

<p>So the videos are likely pertaining to someone trying to overcome that grief while still making certain points and statements about it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I responded to this question earlier, but now that reply is gone, weird. </p>

<p>In a nutshell, the videos seem to have been posted by someone feeling guilty or somewhat responsible for Brett&#39;s death. Other theories exist too, so it depends who you ask, but there is an overall dower and depressed feel to most of the messages we&#39;ve uncovered.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There is a video where they&#39;re filming a monarch butterfly. </p>

<p>Monarchs mostly occur in North/South American although they do have other global populations and they do migrate from Mexico to Canada. However if we are to assume the other videos are also taken in the same place, they are in areas where there are seasons. The only other Monarch populations are in areas where they aren&#39;t really seasons, (Australia, Philippines, Hawaii) </p>

<p>Probably doesn&#39;t help much but I would say they are somewhere in the US, Midwest or Eastern portions and potentially even the southern portions of Canada. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks for that information. Lately we&#39;ve gotten some evidence suggesting it could be taking place in Maine (specifically Augusta, Maine), both because of some plant-life and monarch migration through that region. That could easily be incorrect though.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There&#39;s also a video where it looks to be filmed by a greenhouse. It looked like a fairly professional greenhouse, albeit run down of course. </p>

<p>If you have city/state in mind you can always go to the county assessors office and have them pull all the parcels that are classified as &quot;greenhouse&quot; or &quot;plant propagation&quot;</p>

<p>Also In that same video, it looks like they are on a white gravel driveways that has a area with a tree/shrub growing out of it, may be able to look at google earth in the area you narrowed it down too, you&#39;ll be able to see the glass green houses for sure.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, since it&#39;s been going on so long, lots of information like that has accumulated. </p>

<p>People on our discord all have differing opinions of whether its an ARG or not, primarily because some videos don&#39;t utilize codes at all, and the creators of this content have shown absolutely no interest in our presence or findings, which is very abnormal for typical ARGs. As far as we know, the videos just keep going up regardless of anyone or anything.</p>
