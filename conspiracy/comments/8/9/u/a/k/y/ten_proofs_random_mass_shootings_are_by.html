<p><strong>Proof One: Gun Grabbers Selectively Ignore Mass Shootings, Conceal Patterns;</strong></p>

<p><a href="http://wp.me/p1GyKw-zL">http://wp.me/p1GyKw-zL</a></p>

<ul>
<li>Any time you find a cover up, you necessarily have a conspiracy to contend with. Gun grabbing groups, including government and biased or puppet media forces, should be using every opportunity to make their case for gun control, but act as if the bulk of gun violence never took place. Why do they employ selective blinders? There is a reason.</li>
</ul>

<p>.</p>

<p><strong>Proof Two: Shootings Exist in Identical Magical Categorical Clusters;</strong></p>

<p><a href="http://wp.me/p1GyKw-zN">http://wp.me/p1GyKw-zN</a></p>

<ul>
<li>The Illuminati loves magical numbers, as they can translate into meaningful words or names, or leverage spells. Interesting then, that basic shooting statistics establish set after set in the most magical and potent number of all, one which decodes to Satan. This alone reveals dramatic coincidences well beyond the possibility of random chance.</li>
</ul>

<p>.</p>

<p><strong>Proof Three: Shootings Exist in Endless Sets of Three Forming Straight Lines;</strong></p>

<p><a href="http://wp.me/p1GyKw-zQ">http://wp.me/p1GyKw-zQ</a></p>

<ul>
<li>The same Dispersal Pattern Studies method applied by government researchers to UFO sightings reveals Mass Shootings do something UFO sightings allegedly do not: form repetitive patterns with GPS accuracy, doorway-to-doorway-to-doorway.</li>
</ul>

<p>.</p>

<p><strong>Proof Four: Straight Lines in Turn Form Complex and Perfect Shapes;</strong></p>

<p><a href="http://wp.me/p1GyKw-zT">http://wp.me/p1GyKw-zT</a></p>

<ul>
<li>When it comes to symbolism, nothing outperforms a graphical shape. Better still when that shape itself has magical properties or relationships to other shapes, or its own hidden or obvious meaning. </li>
</ul>

<p>.</p>

<p><strong>Proof Five: Shapes in Turn Form Complementary Magical Clusters;</strong></p>

<p><a href="http://wp.me/p1GyKw-zV">http://wp.me/p1GyKw-zV</a></p>

<ul>
<li>It defies odds that perfect shapes should cluster together in ways which share overlapping lines or corners, and be generally both aligned and mirrored in additional symbolism.</li>
</ul>

<p>.</p>

<p><strong>Proof Six: Shootings Also Relate or Depict Masonic and Satanic symbols;</strong></p>

<p><a href="http://wp.me/p1GyKw-zZ">http://wp.me/p1GyKw-zZ</a></p>

<ul>
<li>Select shootings define such symbols with precision. Masonic Symbols are rendered in 3-D. Satanic Symbols are positioned correctly for magical application by Warlock.</li>
</ul>

<p>.</p>

<p><strong>Proof Seven: Shootings Form Multiple Lines to Cheops Exactly 500 Miles Apart;</strong></p>

<p><a href="http://wp.me/p1GyKw-A1">http://wp.me/p1GyKw-A1</a></p>

<ul>
<li>Extending select shooting lines finds them bisecting at the ancient Cheops Pyramid to establish a series of lines all of equal degrees of arc. But that just prepares us for a bigger bombshell.</li>
</ul>

<p>.</p>

<p><strong>Proof Eight: Shooting Lines Also Depict Cheops in 3-D Cutaway View;</strong></p>

<p><a href="http://wp.me/p1GyKw-A4">http://wp.me/p1GyKw-A4</a></p>

<ul>
<li>The Great Pyramid in Egypt is one of the Holy of Holies to Masons and some satanic cults, and is specifically tied in mysticism to the End Times and historical catastrophic events. This one will scare you.</li>
</ul>

<p>.</p>

<p><strong>Proof Nine: Shooting Sets Share Magical Data Points Which Decode to Messages;</strong></p>

<p><a href="http://wp.me/p1GyKw-A7">http://wp.me/p1GyKw-A7</a>  [dead link]</p>

<ul>
<li>Shooting line sets share three or more identical magical numbers within their data points. These decode to tell us when and where the next shooting will be, name a shooter, or perfectly prophesy some specific outcome. [No, you won&#39;t, because this page is dead]</li>
</ul>

<p>.</p>

<p><strong>Proof Ten: Individual Shootings Examined in Micro Duplicate the National Study Proofs</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Two examples are offered; Aurora and Sandy Hook. They not only duplicate the ten proofs, but they mirror each other and one points to the other.<br/></li>
</ul>

<p>.</p>

<p>The Author refers to his work as the &quot;Unified Conspiracy Theory&quot;</p>

<p>He/she/indeterminate(unlikely) concludes:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Since each proof tends to defy all possible odds of random coincidence, and does so consistently, again and again, naysayers will have their work cut out for them. More so, because in many cases, control groups have been established to show truly random data points enjoy no such pattern. I have done my homework, and carefully so.</p>

<p>I will demand the same of naysayers.</p>

<p>2010 – 47, 1 School</p>

<p>2011 – 35</p>

<p>2012 – 35, 5 Schools</p>

<p>Which is 368 shootings, 62 of which have been selected for  attention by the MSM. The Brady database is dismissed as flawed to the point of uselessness.  The author has counted 450 in total. Another group, an anti-gun coalition, correctly counted 365 documented mass shootings in 2013 ALONE, using a strict - and the correct, apparently - definition of a mass shooting. Unfortunately they only counted one year. </p>

<p><strong><em>and</em></strong></p>

<p>Simply put, if you look at all shootings (about 450 at the point of discovery), not just those media reports, and start to break them down categorically, you quickly find amazing results impossible by chance, with no hope of doing so using media counts:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Exactly 18 mass shootings involved high schools;</p></li>
<li><p>Exactly 18 mass shootings involved colleges;</p></li>
<li><p>Exactly 18 mass shootings involved US Post Offices (‘going Postal’);</p></li>
<li><p>Exactly 18 mass shootings involved Malls;</p></li>
<li><p>Exactly 18 mass shootings involved holidays;</p></li>
<li><p>Exactly 18 mass shootings involved Native Americans directly or indirectly;</p></li>
<li><p>Exactly 18 mass shootings involved Military/First Responders, either as shooting victims, shooters, or both.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Additionally, there appears to be 12 or 13 fast food/speciality restaurants (i.e., pizza, chicken, tacos), and 14 or 15 full menu eateries. The precise number is in question because some locations are not categorically determined by their name, and have since gone out of business.</p>

<p>.</p>

<p>The  mass shootings defy randomness in their placement to form countless lines;  the lines enjoy GPS accuracy doorway-to-doorway-to-doorway; they are revealed by scientific methods — including control groups. The locations of gun shops are used as a control group.  </p>

<p>88 ‘Media’ shootings create 12 lines including three sets of conjoined lines; a set of two lines sharing a common end point (5 shootings); a set of three lines with two endpoint shootings as common points (7 shootings); and a super set of three lines all sharing a single common point at Sandy Hook (7 shootings). Thus 19 of 88 shootings produced such lines, roughly 23%.</p>

<p>Given every line involves at least three shootings, it is quite common among the full collective of shootings that a given shooting is used in multiple lines, but it NEVER happened ONCE in the control groups. </p>

<p>Looking for perfect right angles between lines - on a continental scale, such an occurrence is basically impossible by chance - there are exactly 18 lines which qualify.  </p>

<p><strong><em>and</em></strong></p>

<p>The lines defy randomness in their placement to form countless perfect shapes; the  shapes can be perfect isosceles or equilateral triangles.</p>

<p>and </p>

<p>Taking the lines of mass shootings that form right angles, these same lines ALSO, separately (of course), form isosceles triangles with a mass shooting at each apex. The West Coast of the USA &quot;has&quot; a collection of 18 perfect isosceles triangles of mass shootings, with the base line of these 18 isosceles triangles being lines that ALSO formed perfect, continent scale, right angles (obviously not part of the isosceles triangles) amongst lines of mass shootings.  </p>

<p>&quot;The sum total of all East Coast Isosceles is, just like the West Coast, 18. Also like the West Coast, they are divided into two groups of 9. However, this time, the division is 9 is between those which share immediate direct commonality of a single red foundation line and or a parallel/perpendicular line (Fig. 11, 12, 13), and 9 that don’t.&quot;</p>

<p><strong><em>and</em></strong></p>

<p>the lines also defy randomness in their placement so as to form Masonic and Satanic emblems; the emblems are carefully aligned on the Earth in ways which reflect their function; they are rich with clues that hint at who and where were (are?) the designers; if you look closely, you can actually see how they ‘function’ as a magical weapon.</p>

<p>The problem of false positives and excessive degrees of freedom in finding symbols is discussed. </p>

<p><strong><em>and</em></strong></p>

<p>Major, famous shootings all fall on one set of parallel lines, spaced exactly 500 miles apart, that other less famous shootings also fall, perfectly, on.  </p>

<p>Four baphomet patterns (5-pointed stars) inscribed by perfect lines of mass shootings, each with one side on the 500-mile-spaced grid.</p>

<p>Four Masonic Compass-Square edge symbols perfectly inscribed by these lines (only two intersecting with the 500-mile grid lines)</p>

<p>Of course, the baphomet patterns when combined are together drowning in numeric symbolism (side lengths, differences, distances) if that&#39;s your thing. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>So not only do we have dozens of random shootings which happen to line up in sets of three or more to make straight lines with doorway-to-doorway-to-doorway GPS-level accuracy, but we have two different shooting universes of such lines which share many of the same shootings/lines to form four readily identifiable Masonic emblems in one, and and four satanic baphomet symbols in the other. Each symbol tends to have its own theme or characteristics to imply four different designers, and all symbols have a symbiotic relationship with the orange lines with an identical but yet-to-be explained proof of their own. This should be enough to convince anyone that mass shootings are not random events, but carefully planned, even though some of the shootings may indeed be naturally transpiring and truly random in nature. </p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong><em>and</em></strong></p>

<p>Weird coincidences at the points where 3 or more lines of multiple mass shootings intersect at non-mass-shooting sites (by line extension, or overlap). At GPS accuracy, on a continental scale, it would be extremely unlikely ot have even one 3-line intersection by chance. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>There are certain other line oddities which exist. I’m talking about situations where three or more lines cross each other at the same location within the GPS accuracy limits used for our shooting site doorways. There are exactly 18 of these, our magical number, and there is something very peculiar about ALL of them.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That every single one of these 18 points locations&#39; latitudes and longitudes, both,  sum by twos up to some combination of 18, 13, or 11. [I don&#39;t do numerology myself, but or crazed rules in their cocaine haze might]</p>

<p><strong><em>and</em></strong></p>

<p>that select shooting lines can be extended to a single spot on the other side of the World; and that that spot is the Great Pyramid, Cheops. Other lines of multiple mass shootings just happen by ‘coincidence’ to pass through at least one, but more often, MULTIPLE ancient Illuminati and Knights Templar castles and other properties employed in their conspiratorial affairs, including some more modern facilities, and even Adam Weishaupt’s birthplace.</p>

<p>Other lines, extended, run through the famous glass pyramid at the Louvre Museum in Paris</p>

<p>There is something about the 500-mile spaced grid and the pyramid of Cheops, but I don&#39;t get it - exercise for the reader. </p>

<p><strong><em>and</em></strong></p>

<p>Lines of multiple mass shootings, together, sketch out an accurate 3D rendering of the pyramid of Cheops, complete with internal tunnels (sketched out in lines of mass shootings).</p>

<p><strong><em>and</em></strong></p>

<p>The lines of passing from the pyramid of Cheops to the USA to form the 500-mile grid, pass through the Vatican in Rome, Weishaupt&#39;s birth place, and (maybe) can be made to inscribe a baphomet (5-pointed star) on Europe. </p>

<p>umm, ok. But there seems to be 18 postal site mass shootings already, like the 18 at each other site. So - I don&#39;t know - maybe they&#39;ve, like, paid their being-mass-shooting-ed dues.</p>

It&#39;s all this thick as mud crap like this, &quot;Here we have a set four Isosceles triangles which all have one thing in common; they are all derived from  one of the perpendicular lines from the prior proof (which lies along their common base lines).&quot;</p>

<p>That doesn&#39;t tell me anything. I have to now go back and read everything else to figure out what they mean by prior proofs. I have to then map everything myself to find out if everything is mapped correctly. There&#39;s all these weird esoteric geometric references and in order to even understand what this is trying to SAY, I would need to spend weeks working through this all.</p>

<p>That could be much simpler. </p>

<p>Yup. This isnt&#39; my work; I&#39;m just making posting it here so that those interested can look into it. I read it all, couldn&#39;t find anything wrong with it - given that the author isnt&#39; lying - he even used control groups, was open about degrees of freedom and false positives, and he used precise measurements door-to-door (of shooting scene buildings).</p>

<p>It expanded my mind. YMMV</p>

<p>You also fail in that it is beyond you to find a flaw in these simple, clear measurements [yes, if you could read] that I copied out here. They&#39;re not mine. </p>

<p>OK, show me you&#39;re not a bozo: find a flaw.</p>
