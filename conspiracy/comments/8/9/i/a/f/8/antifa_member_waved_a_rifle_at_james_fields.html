    <div class="md"><p>Now you&#39;re trying to repeat CNN as much as you can to try and poison the well. All sorts of news stations who have nothing to do with CNN, including local outlets, as well as regular people on twitter, all agree it was a car attack. You can&#39;t discredit the story with facts so you&#39;re just trying to ad hominem it with CNN references. Yall are so transparent. All this little shit like pretending you misheard &quot;wave&quot; as &quot;point&quot; and repeating &quot;4th street&quot; while repeatedly omitting the fact that Justice Park is three full blocks away from the crash site. It&#39;s obvious what&#39;s going on here and who you&#39;re running interference for.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you were driving, and a bunch of nazis were on the steet and one waved a rifle at you with the intention of scaring you, and then you got in a fatal car accident where you killed someone</p>

<p>Are you murderer? Did you commit a car attack?</p>

<p>Are you open to the possibility James Fields is not a terrorist, but merely reacted badly in a situation where he panicked and feared for his life and his intention was only to secure his own safety? </p>

<p>I agree if it was on purpose, but we do not know that. i think its likely he was just panicing and had no evil intent. It sounds like you think its likely he intented to harm people. These are reasonable positions</p>

<p>The conspiracy is that the establishment, the mainstream media, is backing the antifa narrative that it was definitely a terror attack</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Maybe they have the same story (along with Fox News and every other media outlet that was there - why are you so hung up on CNN and ignoring everyone else?) because that&#39;s what happened...</p>

<p>CNN is center-left/neoliberal/mainstream. Antifa is radical anarchism with some radical communists also sometimes showing up. They do not get along. The fact you brought up who funds antifa shows how little you understand - antifa isn&#39;t a real organization, at least not in the tradionial sense. Anyone uses the name. I&#39;m antifa.

    <div class="md"><p>Is it what happened though? </p>

<p>I thought you and me agreed that its possible it wasnt a premediated terror attack but could have been a guy panicking and fearing for his safety and reacting badly. Both the media and antifa say it was 100% a deliberate attack.</p>

<p>Why is CNN bakcing up Antifas narrative? Is it because they are on the same side? I know it upsets antifa to learn they are useful idiots to the establishment, used to violently attack actual political dissent the establishment finds dangerous and unacceptable.</p>

<p>Do you have ANY evidence the alt right supports any war on muslim countries? Any alt right leaders ever supporting a current past or future war in the middle east? Or any other war? Or even alt right people, not leaders, expressing such desires?</p>

<p>Watch for yourself, the car starts <em>speeding up</em> at the beginning of this video, which is a block and a half away from where the gun-waving occurred. The street behind him is nearly empty as you can see around 0:25. It also doesn&#39;t help your story that <em>after</em> ramming into the crowd he backs up <em>right toward Justice Park again</em> toward the gun-waver you think he&#39;s so terrified of. </p>

<p>He was already a block and a half away from Justice Park, in a nearly empty street, facing down a crowd of people, and he <em>sped up</em>, causing people to <em>run</em> out of the way. He was trying to kill protesters, I don&#39;t know how it could be clearer.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks.</p>

<p>If a few second before that clip started someone waved a gun at him, as Dwayne Dixon claims to have done on that street(4th street) and then at second 3 on your clip we clearly see someone swinging a baseball bat at his car.... maybe the poor dude just panicked and reacted badly and caused an accident?</p>

<p>What proof do you ahve that he intended to kill protestors, rather than he felt in danger and react very badly while trying to get away</p>

<p>It all happened very quickly. Why do you think it was intentional murder as opposed to a guy reacting to fear for his safety?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>the car was slowing down a bit before the guy attacks it with a bat. And then accelerates after. Do you agree with that?</p>

<p>I&#39;m not saying the James Fields made the right decision. Just that his decision making wasn&#39;t &quot;i want to kill people&quot;, but &quot;omg omg im scared is that guy waving a gun at me....&quot;</p>

<p>I think what happened is someone waved a gun at him and he panicked and caused a deadly accident, but he wasnt intenting to harm people, only to get away from danger</p>

<p>Im not even saying he is completly innocent. There should be a trial. Maybe he is justly guilty of manslaughter.  But I do think he was motivated by fear and panic and things happened quickly, rather than motivated by wanting to harm anyone</p>

<p>And even if there was evidence he was threatened I&#39;d still consider it possible and justified he committed manslaughter. Even if you feel in danger you cant drive into a crowd of people.</p>

<p>Also why was he going around the block several times? If there is no reasonable explanation like &#39;all the intersections were blocked&#39; maybe he was looking to cause trouble.</p>
