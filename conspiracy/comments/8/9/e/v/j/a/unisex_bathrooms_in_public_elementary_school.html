<p>I have a child that is starting school then and I don&#39;t want him sharing a bathroom with girls. More importantly, <em>he</em>doesn&#39;t want to share a bathroom with girls. He&#39;s right at the age where he blushes when you ask him if he is going to have a girlfriend someday.</p>

<p>I&#39;m thinking about telling him to just go outside and pee on a tree if the bathroom situation makes him uncomfortable.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you are waving you parts around, if you take precautions to hide yourself a lawyer would get you off of a charge.</p>

<p>Intent is a huge part of law.</p>

<p>If your intent was to just keep it is one thing if it is to make other people see you pee is another.</p>

<p>Thing is there is a huge cultural difference to eliminating wastes in public.</p>

<p>A buddy of mine was touring Vietnam and he says a day doesn&#39;t go by where he doesn&#39;t see an old woman shitting on the side of the road.</p>

<p>We have a large South Asian population here and the F.O.B.&#39;s will pee into the gutter facing the traffic.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What&#39;s the conspiracy? Why does it even matter, and why not inquire with the school to see what rules would be imposed instead of panicking and assuming they&#39;re intentionally trying to cause distress in your child? When I was in elementary school only time we were allowed to use the bathroom without a teacher standing outside was when a student had to go in the middle of class, in which case they had permission to go by themselves to the nearest bathroom (there was one in every other hallway iirc) but had to be back within a few minutes or get in trouble. This was decades ago in a relatively small grades 0-5 school in a shitty county in Virginia, I can&#39;t imagine a larger school in a yuppie Colorado town not having rules.</p>

<p>You mean the individual stalls, or the communal area? They are not individual bathrooms. </p>

<p>And yet below you say:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I don&#39;t know if they are planning on removing urinals, if they even have them. If I were someone onboard with unisex bathrooms, I would remove them before girls try to sit on them and get injured.</p>

<p>Also, what is the exact conspiracy?  Like what are TPTB pushing?</p>

<p>Reason being, girls start their periods and freak out, they don’t want boys in there. Boys want to peep under/over stalls to see the girls, etc. </p>
