<blockquote>
<p>Six-in-10 Canadians chose “disagree” when asked the question “Are immigration levels too high?” in the February survey by the Environics Institute for Survey Research – a finding that has remained relatively stable for a decade. Eight-in-10 said immigrants have a positive economic impact. Compared with last year’s survey, more respondents believed that immigrants adopt Canadian values. Most of the national results extended a steady 30-year trend toward greater acceptance of immigrants.</p>

<p>How about assimilating into there culture? What&#39;s the point of coming to a new country if all you do is cloister yourself in little communities of your own…continuing to solely speak your native language, eschewing new customs and not assimilating into your new culture?</p>

<p>Check the article I posted to someone else, I can send it to you again. My only assertion is that Canada as a whole is pro immigration and we have historically helped refugees.. I don&#39;t see what&#39;s so controversial about that </p>

<p>Same to you then, that&#39;s why anecdotes are bad for supporting a position </p>

<p>I guess it depends what we mean by assimilation problems, language barriers happen but I don&#39;t think that&#39;s a big problem </p>

<p>Krist even many of athe natives in Canada are unwilling to assimilate.</p>

<p>Lol this is the most ignorant shit I&#39;ve seen all year. Yes it&#39;d the NATIVES that need to assimilate to us, never mind all the decades of preventing them from doing so on top of invading this land from the get go</p>

<p>Incoming anecdotal story!!!</p>

<p>I do know a guy, an immigrant from Ireland, came to BC at 3 months, never got his immigration. Well he decides to rob a few banks. Was notorious back in the 80s</p>

<p>He gets caught and does time. Parole comes up and they notice then that he is a landed immigrant. </p>

<p>They ship him to Ireland. </p>

<p>Long story short he gets a gig as a bouncer by when shit hits the fan he assualt a guy and last I heard he was doing time there.</p>
