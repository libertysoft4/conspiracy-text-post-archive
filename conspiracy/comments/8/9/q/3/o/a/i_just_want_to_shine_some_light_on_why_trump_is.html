        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Trump has been bailed out by Russian billionaires several times in reality he has no real money it’s all controlled by the Russians so they can launder money through real estate deals. Before his first bail out he was a registered Democrat. After he switched to the most right wing person you can find. This has been a long con like history has never seen before. They had to build his character for years to be believable enough for the average citizen not to question his utter destruction of the US. I’m calling it right now Putin is going to admit to it in the next couple years. If the Russians didn’t want us to know about their voting fraud we wouldn’t they control the country completely and allowed those videos to be leaked so the world knows Putin is in charge because he says so. He’s going to own up to fixing our election which would throw us into chaos and weaken us immensely. The Cold War never ended it just went subzero and the citizens didn’t get to watch it anymore. 
This might be a more basic conspiracy for the die hards on here but remember. If it sounds stupid or simple to you you’re not the target audience</p>

<p>The property was not even close to be valued at 95 million. Properties don&#39;t double in value while the rest of the housing market went to shit in 2008.</p>

<p>Except for the fact that appraisal and average prize for a m2 is not the same. Often in good neighboorhoods or blooming areas houses and property go way, way above their appraisal. Source: lived in both Amserdam and London. I&#39;ve seen houses go for 3 times their appraisal and people still making a profit off it. I&#39;d be surprised if the guy who bought it, doesn&#39;t make a nice profit of it, considering the area it is in.</p>

<p>I really want there to be Russian ties, believe me, I can&#39;t wait to see Trump gone, but this nor the SOHO or Panama cases directly implicate Trump to be in debt to the Russians. </p>

<p>He had to tear it down cause it was in such disrepair. </p>

<p>It gets better too.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In addition to the mansion intrigue, Rybolovlev and Trump recently have drawn attention in another peculiar way.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Federal Aviation Administration records reviewed by the Palm Beach Post and other news outlets have tracked Rybolovlev&#39;s private plane to cities where Trump has traveled, during his campaign and into his presidency.</p>

<p>In October, for example, Trump appeared at a campaign rally in Las Vegas. Rybolovlev&#39;s plane arrived in that city an hour after the campaign event started.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That is indeed quite interesting, but there&#39;s still also this quote in the article:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The vacant property&#39;s hefty price is proof the acquisition price, although steep, was worth it, according to Cattell.
&quot;Given the ongoing sale process ... there is every chance the investment in the property will yield a good return,&quot; Cattell said.
And even though Rybolovlev paid an astronomical $95 million for the house, Cattell said his client still got a good deal.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Also Trump bought it through an excecution, which lowers the price by a shitton, as they will most of the times literally take any offer made on the day itself. Alot of people made alot of money during the crisis this way. Housing market plummets, people are forced to sell all their property by the bank, so all you need is a lot of money and then to wait some years for astronomical returns. </p>
