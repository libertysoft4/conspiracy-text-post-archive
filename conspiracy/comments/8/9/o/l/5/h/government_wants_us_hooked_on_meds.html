It is not seen in all my feeds. They are literally hushing us up through the internet. Not everyone can go to rallies...</p>

<p>So...... Let&#39;s put signs in every one of our front yards that simply say... I AM Kratom.... </p>

<p>That way people will see for themselves in person how many people actually use this herbal supplement and then they will ask as many questions as they want and I guarantee you your neighbors will support you. The Internet Is hushing Us Down and making us look like a bunch of Rejects... at 29 my life was turned around when I started taking opiates. I had no clue that  I was going to be in a  7-year battle that almost took my life. I was very successful prior too Pain pills . Those  7 years on meds I did nothing with my life. Now I have my life back and I&#39;m kicking ass and taking names.</p>

<p>I really think this is the best thing we can do is put a sign in our front yard that states....</p>

<p>I AM Kratom</p>

<p>That way we all can get involved</p>

<p>PLEASE UPVOTE SO ALL CAN SEE</p>

    <div class="md"><p>KRATOM is a herbal extract that can make tea formulas that produce the same effect most opiates give with damn near ZERO withdraw symptoms. This guy sounds like he wants to bring to light that our government is pushing an anti-kratom narrative to keep people hooked on drugs/pain meds with no easy solution. I live in Ohio, America&#39;s herion capital and I have seen family and friends go through the worst of the worst. I can see the FDA censorship and demonization of the herb that OP is referring to and it breaks my heart. Another solid example of Big Pharma controlling the suffrage of millions of Americans.
Heavily prescribe pain pills 1980-1990, introduce heroine for the opiate users who can&#39;t get it from their doctors anymore at half the price, then Kratom comes out. Some would go as far as to call it a miracle drug. Basically turns addiction kicking into easy street. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve been addicted to many substances and kratom is no joke. Multiple active alkaloids in this plant cause a very annoying long opiate withdrawal. Please don&#39;t pretend there is no withdrawal. I&#39;d rather quit heroin again and have a majority of the symptoms gone in 5 days. Kratom has some odd serotonin action that I don&#39;t fully understand.</p>

<p>I say this because I started taking it because I ignorantly believed it was harmless.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, after 5 days the acute withdrawal eased up. Even the post acute withdrawal wasn&#39;t that bad compared to benzos or alcohol. For several months I was emotionally sensitive but it was manageable. My restless legs never went away though..</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah you must have a had a nasty addiction to hydro 5s, or Tramadol or someshit like that. After 5 days off of oxy, fent or heroin you would still be shitting/puking your guts out after 5 days.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Google how long tramadol withdrawal is because it is similar to SNRI&#39;s. Kratom is surprisingly similar too, for me kratom withdrawal wasn&#39;t acutely painful but the depression and low energy lasted for many months. Heroin detox was very shitty the first 3 days then day 4 and 5 I started feeling physically better. Drugs fucked my life so I did my best to understand them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ok, fair point. I&#39;m in the same boat as you. Opiates completely took everything from me around 2008-2010 and I&#39;m still working to get my life back to pre-addiction levels. I am scared that my brain has been permanently damaged. All my emotions seem to have been extremely dulled, save for the crippling depression and anxiety that comes with acute withdrawal and PAWS.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It can take 6 months to a year for your brain to start producing the chemicals again that opiates stopped it from producing. If you&#39;re really on opiates. Hydrocodones and weak shot is less time since it&#39;s so weak. Been battling opes since 07. Kratom is the only thing keeping me off of them and I&#39;d much rather deal with kratom wd than a real wd. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree with you. Kratom can be habit forming, but the two main drugs commonly used to get off opiates, methadone and buprenorphine, have insanely long withdrawal timelines, and worse withdrawals than things like oxy...blows my mind how they push this shit on people, and it blows it even more how high of a dosage doctors put people on, and how long they try to keep you on it...years in many cases. So many people are stuck and cant kick, and regret ever getting on these long term maintenance drugs.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Here&#39;s a story from my personal experience. I have had 3 major operations on my spine since I hurt myself in Iraq whilst in the military. Due to that I have been in terrible pain for the past 15 years. The last pain doc I was at had no prblem prescribing me 180 30mg roxicodone and 90 hydromorphone a month....mind you I thought I needed all this, and took it all (and more) every month. Then, all this opiate craze stuff hits and my doc gets busted. The next doc visit I am completely cut off of every opiate and pretty much told I was on my own.  </p>

<p>That led to all kinds of bad decisions on my part. Buying/selling on the street.... heroin, the whole nine. Finally decided to go to the methadone clinic....which probably saved my life. Now I take Suboxone, and will be completely off a opiates in the next year.</p>

<p>I absolutely regret ever taking that first Percocet the doctor gave me. These horrible substances nearly killed me, and have actually killed too many of my friends/family than I want to think about.  This shit is a scourge on our society and is affecting every race/age group and demographic. Fuck Big Pharma!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thank you. My story is no different than millions of other people out there. It&#39;s just that most of the stories will never be heard. There is such a stigma around addictiom that most will never seek the help they need.I had a child 2 years ago and told myself I would never go down that path again for my family. It is a sickness and needs to be treated as such. Once  it sets hold people become completely different, shells of their former selves. It literally changes your brain chemistry so that nothing in life is more important than that flood of opiates to the receptors in the brain.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve done every opiate. Been to prison over them. I&#39;ve battled my addiction my whole life so I studied it and what they do to your body. They shut down so many chemical productions. That shot can&#39;t bounce back in 5 days. Your brain has to rewire and that is a process. I hate seeing misinformation about opiates. Hearing 5 day withdrawals vs 5 months can help to keep some people from going down that road.  5 fucking days. Still can&#39;t get over that. I fucking wish. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Fuck no, I wouldn&#39;t wish it on anyone, except maybe meth heads that talk about withdrawing,  so they will know what wd is. Kratom was such a life saver the last time I quit. Before that i got ahold of some gabapentin,  it helped a bit too. I lose tons of weight coming off, can&#39;t get off the toilet, can barely walk, severely depressed, can&#39;t sleep for at least a month. Then the depression gets super pumped to fuck your life right up for awhile. Best high but damn it comes at a high price. That fent will fucking kill you. I&#39;ve never od&#39;d with over 10 years of banging. Snorted 3 bumps of the fent shit. Fucking od&#39;d, fortunately I was found quickly. Still blows me away.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Omg, I didn&#39;t think many people knew about gabapentin for opiate withdrawal. That shit is amazing!!!! I figured it out on accident. I believe gabapentin is the single best drug to use to come off of opiates. It&#39;s completely eliminated all my withdrawal symptoms.</p>

<p>My brother just OD&#39;d on herion mixed with fent just last week. Luckily he had a narcan shot nearby, but I&#39;m convinced he will not be with is much longer. That grey death is here and it&#39;s devestating. By bro takes 3 inch lines of that shit, when I little key bump is enough to kill someone with a small tolerance. I&#39;m worried I will be attending another funeral for someone I love very soon.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes it is, you will find idiots claiming that people who are on the stuff are damaged because of &quot;mental illness&quot; but they are just torturing people and causing brain volume loss, fucked metabolism, loss of personality, severe akathisia, can&#39;t orient, no thoughts, your ruined. People are forced to take this stuff even though un law says you can&#39;t force anyone to take stuff. Why aren&#39;t people forced to do chemo-therapy? Doesn&#39;t matter because the drugs ruin you. Humans are naturally paranoid and when you can&#39;t think at all cuz your prefrontal cortex is ruined they say you are doing better. Same people who to ect and ruin brains. Shocking. Torture, would not wish this upon anybody but the drs and people who forced this on me. how can you detain a non-criminal. no i was not suicidal(still should&#39;t be a reason). no i did not threaten anyone. They exptrapulated that I was a danger to self/others because they said i was having delusions which could not be even proven were delusions. Huge loophol going on rn with non-criminals getting detained and poisoned. yes i went to court yes i lost. yes you can be detained without due process. i wouldnt even care if they detained you if they couldnt force drugs in you. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I started looking into it after you asked.  I think more people are claiming it is shrinking people&#39;s brains and destroying cells.  I guess they tested some on a monkey and found shrinkage in it&#39;s brain.  Only helpful thing I found was QUIT taking them now.  Like I said I don&#39;t know anything about this besides what I have been reading, but the human brain is pretty intricate and capable of rewiring after foreign substances are removed.  I don&#39;t know if this applies to anti-psychotics, but I definately wouldn&#39;t continue putting them in there.  I&#39;m sorry that you had to go through, that sounds absolutely horrible.  Hopefully enough people come forward, and they continue doing studies that prove how dangerous it is so it can stop being done in the future.  I can&#39;t imagine what you are going through.  I hope karma comes for those who did that to you.  As cheesy as it sounds meditation can help.  If you&#39;re able to sit still and focus for even 5 minutes everyday it may offer a small piece of relief.  </p>

I don&#39;t know how to organize the people i know who are against it to help bring change. Pharma is so big so the only affordable way to really bring change would be to get public opinion on our side because we don&#39;t have enough money to bring them down with court even though un law is on our side. Maybe I&#39;ll make a video that shows people testifying how it is so bad. Would have rather lost an entire arm. The only way i don&#39;t break out into anger at my parents for being so non-understanding of what i want is that i could be sent back and i want to make sure i can die. You want me to not kms, walk a mile in my shoes, no dopamine is terrible, no self is terrible. We all know non-criminal detainment is freudian bullshit.</p>

If you think about it the correct way, yes people will see its wrong, but I think a very large percentage of people are brainwashed into thinking all these people &quot;need help&quot; - it&#39;s thought policing and if someone commits a crime detain them then! I think I would have to put together a very emotive film/ or short video to truly get to people. I think that public opinion is pretty scewed towards detaining non crims. I think it is worth pointing out: lots of propaganda currently meant to make us turn against each other. Creating a divide by making it main stream to look down on other people who are deemed &quot;deranged&quot; is like modern day eugenics. Another example is the two party divide and racial tensions and feminist opposite sex hating. Hilarious to me how obvious it is to me how psychiatry is to divide, also take guns, and make money off pharma sales. In russia they are using &quot;mental health&quot; to sack politically opposed people. We are just as vulnerable to that.</p>

But it&#39;s the low doses that are the most interesting to me. If you take 2-4g, you&#39;ll get an extremely subtle but effective painkilling effect, but you&#39;ll also feel like you took a caffeine pill.

<p>Despite increasing reports and studies on Kratom, to our knowledge, respiratory depression or significant opioid toxic syndrome have not been reported as the toxicity from Kratom.</p>

<p>There have been cases of respiratory depression when Kratom is combined with alcohol, benzodiazepines, and other opioids. These interactions can be unpredictable and are influenced by many factors. If you&#39;re just taking Kratom, you&#39;ll be fine.</p>

Opiates at derived specifically from opium though, and opioids are synthetic &amp; any molecule that works on opioid receptors.

    <div class="md"><p>They are not neatly terms with fixed definitions. For some opiates are strictly organic compounds from a poppy, meaning that Kratom would be an opioid just like heroin.

<p>Either way, what actual difference would it being an opioid rather than opiate mean? It&#39;s still doing the same exact thing, the only possible question is the species of plant it comes from and whether it is synthetic or natural.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Opiate and opioid don&#39;t necessarily have fixed definitions. Even so, what would your point be? Do you think it being an opioid means it doesn&#39;t do anything?</p>

<p>In some definitions the only opiates are those that are natural and come from the poppy plant. This means that poppy alkaloids are opiates, but Kratom and Heroin are opioids.</p>

<p>In others, opiate vs opioid is natural vs synthetic. Poppy and Kratom are opiates and Heroin is an opioid.</p>

<p>In other definition opiates and opioids are synonyms.</p>

<p>So the questions are:</p>

<p>which definition of opiate and opioid are you using? and what difference does it actually make as classifying one way or the other?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Dr. Henningfield, PhD called kratom a non- opioid.</p>

<p>“My team and I reviewed the medical literature to determine the potential for abuse of kratom,” Henningfield said. “It’s a natural substance, a non-opioid that provides an alerting effect in low doses and a mild opiate-like effect in higher doses. Again, the best comparison is caffeine. Some people may come to depend on it for its effects, but it doesn’t pose a real danger of addiction or other severe adverse effects.” <a href="https://www.wci360.com/news/article/kratom-banned-in-wisconsin">https://www.wci360.com/news/article/kratom-banned-in-wisconsin</a></p>

<p>Obviously more well-controlled clinical trials are needed but in Update on the Pharmacology and Legal Status of Kratom Dr. Walter C. Prozialeck, PhD, stated &quot;strong evidence demonstrates that the effects of kratom are actually quite different from those of classic opioids...Importantly, even at very high doses, kratom does not depress respiration...recent studies indicate that even though the mitragynines can interact with opioid receptors, their molecular actions are different from those of opioids...Based on all of the evidence, it is clear that kratom and its mitragynine constituents are not opioids and that they should not be classified as such.&quot;</p>

However, a lot of people in our society equate &quot;natural&quot; with safety, ignoring (or not knowing) that they&#39;re still consuming an opioid.

    <div class="md"><p>No, they have 36 deaths where kratom was found in the their system. One of those &quot;kratom associated&quot; deaths is a fucking murder victim for fucks sake.

<p>The studies have shown it doesn&#39;t cause respiratory depression, albeit there have only been a few, but they&#39;re empirical. Kratom has some strange properties. But regardless, you are right. Kratom is a drug and should be considered with care. But, it is objectively safer and can be as  effective as it&#39;s pharma counterparts.  </p>

My memory was shot, I was constantly spaced out, so I quit after 6 months.  The next drug, Gabapentin, was even worse, so I just stopped going to the doctor.  I had a feeling this was going to escalate to the point where I did nothing but drool and sleep. </p>

<p>Kratom isn&#39;t on a par with the prescription drugs, and that is why I take it.  I can keep my pain at bay which helps me maintain my sanity without the spaced out feeling and the memory loss.

    <div class="md"><p>Kratom can have its benefits and has medicinal value. There is no doubt about that. It is also &quot;safer&quot; in terms of a very high LD50. Haven&#39;t heard of one legit overdose. That being said...</p>

<p>There is a lot of misinformation about kratom. I was addicted on it for 3-4 years. I also have been addicted to multiple opiates. I just want to put this out as a warning. Kratom is no joke to come off of. Yea, the physical withdrawal isn&#39;t as bad as other opiates. But there is post acute withdrawal, there is some weird mechanisms at play that make the withdrawal very very long and drawn out. I also suspect is messes with hormones as there are multiple reports of hair loss. libido issues, etc. If anyone asks me if they should try kratom, it is always a no. Of course, I was addicted and that is my fault. But I would not want anyone to go through that shit.  </p>

<p>If you are unsure about kratom and the withdrawals, visit r/quittingkratom. You&#39;ll get a lot of information there and what to expect. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I know this is <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> and there&#39;s an intrinsic mistrust of government, but the press release is worth a read. It&#39;s very clear that they have not ruled out use of kratom, but are concerned about people using it without it being studied further. They are also concerned about insufficient quality and dose control. Think about it this way: if this was a newly developed drug, it would not be on the market because it has not had sufficient safety testing.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hi again lol. </p>

<p>In the spirit of <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>, I submit to you that at the behe$t of Big Pharma, the government has been pushing a concerted campaign to monopolize Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine by way of criminalizing and scheduling Kratom.</p>

<p>I mentioned before the small number of studies. It isn&#39;t lack of interest that makes that number small. The government has repeatedly denied research grants and funding requests for studies on kratom, making those few studies self-funded. </p>

<p>You mention a newly developed drug as an analogy, but two years ago when the DEA first tried to schedule kratom, a month or so before the announcement a drug company actually filed patents for a pill containing the derivatives Mitragynine and 7-hydroxymitragynine.</p>

<p>If that pill is as effective as a midrange dose of kratom, I could honestly see it replacing all but break-thru pain meds.            </p>

<p>For the record, I voted in favor of marijuana legalization in my state, though I initially voted against it because the initiative was poorly written/structured. Better to wait another couple of years than to put in place a poorly constructed system that would be used as an example by marijuana opponents.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I’m not sure a sign on the lawn is going to accomplish anything, but agree that Kratom should not be made illegal. People will still find ways to obtain it, and there will be no quality control. In the midst of a heroin “epidemic” banning a substance that is keeping a lot of addicts out of the streets/off harder drugs is an awful idea. America’s war on drugs is a joke. Other countries that have decriminalised drugs(Portugal) have far less drug related problems than America. The big reason for the Kratom ban is that it’s currently not profitable for big pharma or the corporate cash cows. I don’t want some evil suit wearing mask faced puppeteers telling me what I can and cannot consume, and neither should any of you. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oxy codone is heavily regulated and kinda has a bad rep right now due to the epidemic. Same with a lot of the other people opiods.</p>

<p>A few months ago when there was a threat for Kratom to be outlawed by Jeff Sessions I think and everybody was signing petitions and shit another story broke about a pahrma company that had secured the rights to sythesize or patent an ingredient from Kratom. Real interesting timing with all that. The gov backed down with their threats to ban Kratom but big pharma is still researching and developing a synthetic version afaik. Wouldn&#39;t be at all surprised to see another push to outlaw kratom once that new sythetic comes online. It will be sold to the medical community and the public as a new improved and less addictive substance like Oxy-Contin was a couple decade ago. Compare Oxy-Contin&#39;s potency and addictive potential to just raw opium goo that is cut straight from the poppy pod. The raw Opium is much less dangerous or addictive but we aren&#39;t allowed to grow it are we. Tptb will do the same thing with kratom if they get their way. Or they&#39;ll just leave it legal and do what they did with tobacco and put in additives that are addictive and sell it in a convenient package at a price low enough the average person won&#39;t consider worth their time or effort to source their own healthier version. I see a similar fate on the horizon for marijuana. Hope I&#39;m wrong, but there is just too much money at stake.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t suppose I&#39;d be against a little regulation for Kratom if it meant some sort of process was put in place to make sure the stuff coming in was clean of adulterants and pesticides and fertilizers but I don&#39;t see the government and big pharma being all that benevolent about it if history is to be our teacher. </p>

<p>Kratom users just need to get their heads around boilng the stuff to make sure you kill any e-coli. It&#39;s a fucking plant for Christ sake. I don&#39;t need the government or big pharma to hold my hand and I can already get enough booze, cigarettes and cough medicine at the corner store to kill an elephant so other than greed I don&#39;t see any problem leaving an all natural gift from nature to the people.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Aye, they package it together with an SSRI and call it Tramadol (at least that&#39;s what they call it here in the UK.) Nasty stuff that is, really nasty stuff.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t think Tramadol is an opiod packaged with an ssri. Afaik it&#39;s an Opiod that happens to have some ssri or snri (not sure which) properties to it. Depending on ones body chemistry it can be used as an anti-depressant to people who respond atypically to conventional anti-depressants. As a pain killer it has lower addiction potential than other comparable sythetics. As an anti-depressant it may have a higher addiction potential but has less severe withdrawal symptoms than a lot of the more typical anti-depressants. The withdrawal symptoms are like a mild opiod which doesn&#39;t typically necessitate the long taper that anti-depressants do. You might get a little dope sick coming off Tramadol but you won&#39;t have as much a risk for a psychotic break or total mental relapse into depression and suicide if you don&#39;t taper just right like you would on more typical anti-depressants. It&#39;s actually a really great drug for a select few people who don&#39;t respond to typical anti-depressants. Nice not to have to have the long work-up and taper down and the withdrawal symptoms of regular anti-depressants. If you are one of those people who has an injury and associated depression, you might get your fix with just that one drug rather than go the route of having an anti-depressant and a more typical opiod and all the hazzards that come with those. It&#39;s actually too bad it got rescheduled in with the rest of the opiods a few years ago here in the states. With the bad rap Opiods are getting and as toxic as anti-depressants can be, Tramadol had great potential it may never realize. I think it would be a great alternative for a lot of combat veterans in particular and maybe a great taper down drug for conventional opiod addicts. As with anything, people&#39;s personal body chemistry makes all the difference in the world with things like this. It&#39;s too bad that it&#39;s one more tool in the tool box that is getting lumped in with the rest of the Opiod family by people that get it prescribed to them and have a negative experience. For people with genuine pain, there is no perfect drug. Pain killers are inherently addictive. If someone has an injury and they want to be functional there will always be a give and take with Opiods. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Me too bro, I tried cold turkey from H cut with fent and after 5 days I had to be rushed to the ER due to dehydration and lack of eating any food as I had not even hardly been able to keep water down without vomiting.  5 days....lmfao. That&#39;s just another propaganda lie probably created by the phara industry to downplay the absolute horror of opiate withdrawal. I wouldn&#39;t wish it on my worst enemy. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, it&#39;s a plant which contains opiate alkaloids. I mean by your definition the poppy is not an opiate, it&#39;s a plant that contains opiate alkaloids. Find if you want to be pedantic.</p>

<p>Kratom is a plant that contains opiate alkaloids.</p>
