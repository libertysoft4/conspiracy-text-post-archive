        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>There&#39;s a story on the front page of this sub about the SR71 being 60&#39;s technology. I agree with this idea. There&#39;s no way you go 50 years without making any real progress in any area of technology.</p>

<p>So what does this have to do with fusion energy? Same deal. We&#39;ve known how fusion works since the first H bomb was built. We&#39;ve known that a reactor requires plasma temps and pressures and a strong enough magnetic confinement field. And we&#39;ve known all of these things and been working on the problems since the 1950&#39;s. I highly doubt that the major nations of the world couldn&#39;t come up with a breakthrough when they&#39;ve had 60 years to work out the wrinkles.</p>

<p>Now here&#39;s some proof.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.theeventchronicle.com/science/lockheed-martin-patents-nuclear-fusion-powered-fighter-jet-2/">http://www.theeventchronicle.com/science/lockheed-martin-patents-nuclear-fusion-powered-fighter-jet-2/</a></p>

<p>Oho! A fighter jet with a fusion powered engine... really? We can&#39;t build a practical reactor that would be the size of a power plant, but all of a sudden there&#39;s a patent for a version that would work in a fighter jet?</p>

<p>Why are we seeing this now? Because just a week or two ago the Russians claimed to have a <a href="https://thediplomat.com/2018/03/russia-reveals-unstoppable-nuclear-powered-cruise-missile/">nuclear powered cruise missile with unlimited range</a>. This fusion fighter patent is probably the US reaction to the Russian claim.</p>

<p>I think that practical fusion energy has been possible for several decades. But the tech has been suppressed for a couple of reasons. One, it would be too disruptive to the established energy industries. </p>

<p>For another thing, the tech would spread quickly to other countries. The US had the atomic bomb all to itself for maybe 5 years before the Russians did their first test. I can imagine a world where China starts building their own fusion plants less than ten years after the first American one goes online. Now China no longer depends on imported oil and their industry gets even more of a boost?</p>

<p>No. I think we could have had fusion power years ago. But someone higher up decides it would help someone else out more than it would help us. So it&#39;s been held back on purpose.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Then the stepping stones necessary to develop the tech. Assume methods have application in other areas as well. What cascade of developments come out of the ideas that work here? Anything else with disruptive potential? Destructive potential? </p>

<p>Nuclear power development created power for the collective efforts of one country to destroy the planet. What happens when we move to develop the power for a singular individual to destroy the whole planet? How long before someone crazed takes up that potential? Hell, imagine zero point energy were actually tapped? The lesson learned is that maybe sufficiently advanced technology needs to be locked away as long as possible to prevent proliferation and risk of misuse.</p>

<p>At least historically, there&#39;s some foundation for that. On the campaign trail, Carter promised to open UFO files that the federal government was holding. Once he got into office, he went back on that promise for national security reasons. There is speculation that the UFO sightings he refused to release were of stealth bombers test flights at night.</p>

<p>Also, regarding the tech spreading to other countries; Lots of countries <em>are already</em> cooperating on fusion energy.  </p>

<p>For example:  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>In southern France, <strong>35 nations</strong> are collaborating to build the world&#39;s largest tokamak, a magnetic fusion device that has been designed to prove the feasibility of fusion as a large-scale and carbon-free source of energy based on the same principle that powers our Sun and stars.  </p>

<p>Thousands of engineers and scientists have contributed to the design of ITER since the idea for an international joint experiment in fusion was first launched in 1985. The ITER Members—<strong>China, the European Union, India, Japan, Korea, Russia and the United States</strong>—are now engaged in a 35-year collaboration to build and operate the ITER experimental device, and together bring fusion to the point where a demonstration fusion reactor can be designed.

<p>Turning theory into a working product takes years and in some cases decades of design and iteration to get the breakthroughs needed to achieve particular feats of engineering.  That&#39;s why you&#39;re seeing F-22s and F-35s being built now and not 30 or 40 years ago, because there were multiple programs that needed to be successful first, F-117, B-2, Harrier Jump Jet, to name a few.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>First off, this patent is for only one major component of a fusion reactor.  Second, you can submit and be awarded patents without actually having built anything, companies do it all the time, especially when they are planning to begin working on major projects with new technology.  Also, this patent isn&#39;t specifically for a fusion powered jet, that is just erroneous assumptions by individuals who do not understand how patents are submitted in the US.  It says what it is in the title, <em>Encapsulating Magnetic Fields for Plasma Confinement</em>.  It is quite literally a design patent for a plasma containment vessel.</p>

<p>Furthermore, putting a fusion reactor on a jet at this point in time is closer to Star Trek and other science fiction then it is grounded in reality.  Lockheed Martin simply did what any other aerospace company would have done and included aircraft as part of the scope of what is protected under the patent.  And when Lockheed Martin manages to get a working reactor the size of jet engine, if that is even physically possible, which is highly unlikely.  It&#39;ll probably be past the year 2200 at which point jet engine propulsion will probably not be the desired means of propulsion for an aircraft.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No. Of course the conservation of energy is not wrong. Would you say the same to some scientist working on hot fusion even though they&#39;re working on an over-unity energy technology -- meaning we get more energy out of it than we put in by tapping the nuclear energy and turning it into heat. We use the passive energy stored in nuclear bonds to get more energy out than we put in. That doesn&#39;t violate the conservation of energy.</p>

<p>The trick is in realizing that there are other, more efficient ways than hot fusion to passively tap into stored nuclear energy and turn it safely to heat. </p>

<p>That&#39;s the narrow answer. The broader answer is that there are other sources of energy surrounding us that science has no idea exists, let alone how to tap into those sources. At least, the science which is publicly paraded around and which is a subtle but powerful misdirection from the truth, which is hidden.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>For one thing Fermilab isn&#39;t quite done yet. While CERN is doing their thing with the LHC, the guys in Batavia are planning on repurposing the Tevatron as part of a newer type of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plasma_acceleration">frame-dragging accelerator.</a> This might also lead to some fun stuff if they ever focus their efforts on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Majorana_fermion">Majorana Fermions.</a></p>

<p>Then it might be getting into stuff like fields that carry the acceleration component that gives things inertia/gravity and weird stuff like that. Stuff that sounds more sci-fi than what&#39;s involved with usual energy production and projects dealing with more known things like the usual fusion models. This may also tie into revamped efforts to either detect or produce dark matter. It&#39;s like another side topic to delve into while the other accelerator at the forefront is more focused on antimatter and researching its behavior and properties.</p>

<p>But who knows if that relates any to what&#39;s gone on in the black sector research that taxpayer dollars just disappear into. (If so, they&#39;re comparatively late to the game.) Seems the secretive part of the government has still been able to keep a pretty good lid on that compared to what happened with fission based nuclear research.</p>

If third world countries had there own industrial revolution we would not have a decrease in population. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This has nothing to do with Facebook posts and nothing to do with millenials. You are right that the industrial revolution was accompanied by a huge population growth. But what we&#39;ve seen in the US, European, and other developed economies in the last century is that economic prosperity has been followed by a reduction in the birthrate. In some countries the birth rate is even below replacement levels. So the relationship between economic prosperity and population growth is not so straightforward. It seems to be more of an inverted-U shape, contributing to population growth until some point then lowering it. I guess it&#39;s an open question of what impact free energy would have on population growth in the short run, but in the long run it should reduce it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, he basically says that almost everything in physics is wrong. Though in many cases the errors that result are rather small. The problem though is that even small errors tend to compound over time, so he had to go back to the beginning to fix what was wrong. So he never shows what is wrong without fixing it and moving forward. The discoveries he makes as a result are astounding. </p>

<p>Wow, I&#39;m impressed you already made it down to the 170th paper he posted there. That was fast. But if you had read the paper, you would know what it is he says complex numbers are being used to hide. Here I&#39;ll quote the relevant paragraphs; the key is in the second one: </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Now, the reason this sort of math works in electrical engineering and in quantum electro-dynamics is that this expansion into ordered pairs gives you four dimensions from only two initial variables. You get a sort of matrix with four degrees of freedom. As a heuristic device, it is clear why this would be useful. But it is also useful as a device of mis-direction and obfuscation, since two of these dimensions or degrees of freedom can exist in the dark, undefined and unnoticed. This serves to hide the mechanics, and the very existence of the mechanics. Because these dimensions are imaginary, no one asks mechanical questions about them. The math hides real interactions under confusing variables or functions, and no one ever looks at them. This is just one more reason that the foundational electrical field or the charge field has been defined as &quot;virtual.&quot; It is smashingly easy to turn the switch from &quot;imaginary&quot; to &quot;virtual&quot;, since they are basically the same thing. Virtual particles are imaginary particles, ones that do the mechanical fudging where the imaginary variables did the mathematical fudging.</p>

<p>But why would physicists want to hide the mechanics under confusing math? Because they know how to do the math, but they don&#39;t know much about the mechanics. They have fit the math to the data after the fact, but can&#39;t explain the data mechanically. To be specific, they have followed Lagrange in this creation of extra degrees of freedom out of nothing, and it is because, like him, they recognized they needed them. But since neither Lagrange nor anyone since could assign those degrees of freedom to anything physical, they have hidden the physics. They have buried the physics under the math, so that students of both math and physics would not ask them the hard questions. </p>

<p>To be even more specific, no one has seen that both the data and the math require a second field in physics beyond the gravitational field. Or, if they have seen it, they have not been able to say what that field is. So it was best to hide the fact. But the field is just the charge field, as I have shown in dozens of papers. The old equations already contained it, including Newton&#39;s gravitational equations, the Lagrangian, Laplace&#39;s field equations, and so on. What is more, the electromagnetic equations have also been unified all along, containing gravity. Coulomb&#39;s equation, like Newton&#39;s, is already unified. That is why both celestial mechanics and electromagnetics have required these extra degrees of freedom: the math of both has to represent the unified field, whether the mathematicians and physicists can assign the variables or not.</p>

<p>The claim against fusion is always the massive amount of input energy required to start a successful fusion reaction, which currently (if we believe what we&#39;re told) can only happen in a few (or really only one) massive lab, and even then, really doesn&#39;t create a self-sustaining reaction. If this article really is true, and this patented design both works and is fielded soon, then your premise is correct - we&#39;d have been able to produce power via fusion for at least a decade. </p>

<p>I&#39;m reminded of my school days, where we were told fusion was just on the horizon - that was back in 2013. Course, they also told us we were on the edge of a nuclear Renaissance, which was a lie, so I never really believed them about fusion either.  </p>

<p>Decades ago we couldn’t do it at all. Now we are perfecting it, every test lasting longer and longer. It’s only a matter of time before we can do it for long enough to use commercially. Just because it’s taking a while doesn’t mean it won’t happen. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>SMH that&#39;s the whole point of this post. If this patent is real, and a successful jet fusion reactor is constructed soon, then it would mean that we would have been able to do it commercially for a long time now, but that the tech was withheld from us. If we can&#39;t create an exothermic fusion reaction in the lab, how could we do it in a jet? The reverse is true as well - if we can do it in a jet, then obviously we can do it in a lab, or in a power plant, etc. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Of course!   I’ll try to keep this brief. A friend sold tech to Raytheon about 12 years ago. The tech is disturbing and another conversation for another day. During negotiations there was reportedly a 4 star general in the room. One of his partners was discussing the 25,000 Chinese soldier march that was a popular email at the time.  Basically China could line 25,000 men of fighting age on their beach and march them into the ocean and drown them. They could do this into infinity one line after another due to their massive population. The discussion revolved around how this had to be disconcerting for a military leader. The general said, ‘we could wipe China off the map in 7 minutes’. The partner, brought up that it takes like 28 minutes for a full nuclear exchange and how was that possible. The general replied, ‘nuclear?!, you’re thinking way to 1960 son’ and would say no more. That was 12 years ago. </p>

<p>Does it surprise anyone here that there is a significant amount of suppressed technology when we can’t even get truthful news about the days events?!?!!!</p>

The US Navy has railgun technology already, if you get a 10kg tungsten slug getting a gravity assisted impact at an already incredible speed you&#39;ll do some damage from a potentially almost undetectable source. Now add in a relatively quick RoF or a battery of weapons/satellites and you can saturate an area in minutes.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, definitely.</p>

<p>I often comment about how solar has already made fusion obsolete. Costs have been dropping rapidly and nations like China and India have been moving ahead with solar by leaps and bounds.</p>

<p>In the tech and futurology subs, you often see articles talking about how solar is already cheaper than coal in many applications. The only thing missing is grid level storage and the tech already exists for that.</p>

<p>Now think about how fusion is still 20 years away. Keep that fact in mind and then look at where solar will be in 20 years. Who&#39;s going to want a billion dollar fusion plant when they can have 100 solar ones putting out more energy for the same price?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is absolutely retarded, one of the stupidest conspiracy theories I’ve heard. </p>

<p>Read about fusion energy. Do some research. Just because you don’t understand why it’s hard, doesn’t mean it’s being held back. </p>

<p>The main problem with your theory is this: fusion energy offers complete energy independence, no more reliance on fossil fuels. There’s nothing the government wants more than free, infinite energy. That goes for every government, bar the few oil producing countries. It would absolutely screw over Russia and Iran for one. Every corporation, except for those in the energy industry also want nothing more than infinite free energy. </p>

<p>So ask yourself, if almost every government is desperate for it, and almost all of our corporate overlords are desperate for it, why the fuck is it being held back? Answer... it’s definitely not. Especially as our energy needs grow infinitely and our resources shrink. </p>

<p>Shows what you know. Just look at solar. In some nations, it&#39;s advancing by leaps and bounds. But in nations where there&#39;s already an established fossil energy infrastructure you hear about promoting coal because jobs and you see rollbacks on tax credits.</p>

<p>What they want to do is transition over a period of decades. We probably could have gone over to fusion years ago but it would have been too disruptive to the big players (like Big Oil).</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Yep. And with fusion, they would suddenly be independent of the power of the petroleum industry. That means nations like China would be a lot harder to keep in check.</p>

<p>Think of oil like you&#39;d think of heroin. You might not be the dealer, but you control the supply. When someone messes with you, you can crash the price or you can jack it up.</p>

<p>If/when fusion ever becomes a thing, the oil industry would become irrelevant in a very short time. That&#39;s because fusion can power everything on electricity. As soon as you&#39;ve got enough juice to power 20% of your transportation, the drop in demand for petroleum will crash the price. Usually that leads to increased use which means a price rebound. But fusion would cause a permanent decline in demand.</p>

<p>The oil industry, with all their trillions, is going to try and keep that from happening for as long as they can.</p>
