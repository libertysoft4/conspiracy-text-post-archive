        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>For example, take the curiously timed resurgence of the MH17 mystery. As a disclaimer, let me stress that indeed <em>Russia may very well be the culprit</em> in this particular instance.</p>

<p>However, for those who are paying attention, it&#39;s the dramatic absence of an actual discussion that should be cause for alarm. It&#39;s the ruthless demonization of <em>any</em> sentiment that doesn&#39;t accept these claims at face value.</p>

<p>When they won&#39;t even <em>entertain</em> a discussion, then you know shit is rotten in Denmark.</p>

<p>It goes against the very nature of <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> to parrot word-for-word the stories and sentiments of <a href="/r/all">/r/all</a>. </p>

<p>Don&#39;t get me wrong, officially sanctioned mainstream conspiracy theories absolutely have a place on this sub, however it&#39;s the manipulation of the comment sections of these stories where this pernicious behavior is becoming so blatant.</p>

<p>What can we do about it? Vote! Comment! Contribute! Stop being a passive observer and join the fray!</p>

<p>They&#39;re going all out with the manipulation of online discussion, and it would be foolish to think <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> isn&#39;t a target.</p>

<p>Let&#39;s make <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> great again!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was running as such before the 2016 election.  I recused myself from modding Trump related conspiracies until after the election because of my obvious bias (that I make no efforts to hide).  After the election I went back to my usual routine and a couple fellow mods had a shit fit, and they were more biased against Trump than I was for Trump.  They were willing to excuse any level of anti-conspiracy sentiments so long as the users were anti-trump.  I tried to deal with the problem in cooperation with the other mods for a solid year before I demodded everyone and started demanding they mod in the context of pro-conspiracy acceptable, anti-conspiracy bannable.  Then the admins got involved (in less than 5 minutes) and stripped my mod permissions while they reinvited everyone back to the mod team.  I was in the process of reinviting those who were willing to mod a conspiracy forum (not a news feed) when the admins fucked everything up.  </p>

<p>That is why the sub is in the state it is in today.  I could fix the entire problem in 2 weeks flat if given full reign, there would be drama but mostly artificial and within a few months the sub would be about Conspiracy theories again.</p>

<p>Its not a political situation exclusively, I have executed the same process against Conspiracy related special interest groups who for example AE911TRUTH.ORG insisted on bullying any alternative 9-11 theories that weren&#39;t ae911truth related.  I don&#39;t tolerate this bullshit from any group.  It&#39;s not political it&#39;s about organic users versus outside groups trying to force your sub into compliance like we are seeing happen right now with shareblue/CTR or whatever they call themselves now.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ha, I actually just considered writing you a message on the subject!</p>

<p>Obviously it&#39;s quite skewed and I honestly don&#39;t think it serves a useful purpose. </p>

<p>Even when I don&#39;t agree with someone, I upvote them (if they haven&#39;t resorted to personal attacks) because up voting their comment gets my reply exposure too (I ain&#39;t daft 😋). I think the downvotes you&#39;re getting aren&#39;t even related to what you&#39;re saying. &quot;People&quot; don&#39;t like you for whatever reason and this is the easiest outlet to show that.</p>

<p>Personally, I don&#39;t have a problem with you and I have upvoted you across this thread, I&#39;d only say I think you sometimes take a contrarian stance on purpose but I find that&#39;s an opportunity for debate rather than a sign you are some nefarious actor!</p>

<p>The fact that this is currently #2 in <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> means the users think it&#39;s a valuable point and a worthy discussion, yet this simply isn&#39;t reflected by the voting patterns ITT.</p>

<p>What can be done though? I think reminding people to upvote is a good idea, a lot of times I&#39;ll be in a thread in new that&#39;s a few hours old and all the comments are at 1. If people engage with voting positively I think it really changes the &quot;psyche&quot; of the sub in general. Let some positivity shine on the dark! </p>

    <div class="md"><p>There&#39;s a lot of different motive to explore there, isn&#39;t there?</p>

<p>It&#39;s open to wide possibilities too. Maybe they were warned off the moon. Maybe, as you mentioned, they can&#39;t go, that is, more advanced tech is required to survive. Maybe it was all a cold war ploy? Ultimately the cold war was an underlying motivation, it was never about exploration. Maybe ET(a very broad term here) knows this?</p>

<p>Maybe they continue to go and don&#39;t tell us? Which begs further questions of course. What is it about our solar system or galaxy that would be so disturbing to the common person down here the powers that be would choose this route? Maybe religion has something to do with it, realizing humanity is obviously not the apex of life among other things.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know what motive Greer would have to lie, unless there was, as mentioned, some type of deception whether deliberate or inadvertent. I&#39;m not seeing a motive to lie, however, I see plenty of motive to what he basically suggests. There are people on planet earth suppressing technology, that much is obvious.</p>

<p>I take it with a grain of salt and frankly, what Greer says doesn&#39;t matter to me. What does matter are the hundreds or eye-witnesses on record. Why doesn&#39;t anybody talk about that? That&#39;s really the core of what he talks about - Greer himself, who cares about him, what about the eye-witnesses? Nothing is ever mentioned about them I guess because they don&#39;t fit the &#39;Greer is full of shit&#39; theory, picking and choosing what you don&#39;t like about what somebody says while ignoring the true core is illogical.</p>

<p>He&#39;s acting at being an astrophysicist? Wow, he&#39;s played this role for years then. I was at the Hayden Planetarium in 2000 when he was director and saw the refurbishment of it that he designed and was directly involved in. </p>

<p>He certainly is playing the long game in &quot;acting&quot; as an astrophysicist for more than 20 years...to...what, exactly?  What&#39;s the crisis actor role he is playing in graduating from Harvard with a degree in physics? At what point does he stop being an &quot;actor&quot; and start being a legitimate scientist? Is it when he earns his doctorate in astrophysics? Because at that point, you pretty much <em>are</em> a scientist.</p>

<p>I agreed with what you said, it didn’t need NDT to add validity. It didn’t add it anyway. </p>

<p>I agree with you that so much of the work comes down to us vs them and it’s counterproductive. People are going to see things from different perspectives based on a lot of factors. And sometimes it’s our job to listen more. And empathize. It doesn’t mean they’re right and you’re wrong. Or vice versa, but you can’t start a conversation if you go in thinking like that. </p>

<p>Wouldn&#39;t be surprised if caperfiliy, Snakeinabox and babylon_dude are the same person or part of an organisation. Most of the top comments here tend to get massive amounts of upvotes very quickly and derail the discussion. When you read the rest of the comments you realise that many people are of the opposite opinion of the top commenter, so how is it they get so many upvotes?</p>

<p>It&#39;s almost impossible to have a good conversation here anymore. It&#39;s just submissions, attacks, then infighting and all of a sudden everyone has forgotten about the subject matter and move onto the next post. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>What often happens is too many people here in r/conspiracy of all places believe what oligarchs and people in power say, or at least claim to believe them. This is a new thing that developed after the 2016 election. Examples:</p>

<p>Donald Trump says he is against wars. Donald Trump hires on one of the most notorious neocons John Bolton, and makes good on his promise to &quot;rip up&quot; the Iran deal -- thereby advancing the PNAC agenda that everyone here should know all about.</p>

<p>FBI guy Peter Strzok says terrible things about Donald Trump in emails that are conveniently leaked to the press a few days before we find out that Peter Strzok actually drafted the &quot;Comey letter&quot; that Republicans leaked 11 days before the election.</p>

<p>Mark Zucherberg says nice thing about Democrats and has a good relationship with them, meanwhile taking Russian Rubles to propagate disinformation and permitting Republican oligarch Robert Mercer to &quot;scrape&quot; the information of tens of millions of Facebook users to target with designer information to appeal to their emotions.</p>

<p>Stop trying to tell us what we believe at <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>.</p>

<p>You&#39;ve hit at the crux of my post, namely that <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> as a sub <em>does not subscribe to any particular conspiracy theory</em> as a majority, and that even includes &quot;popular&quot; conspiracies like JFK and 9/11.</p>

<p>In addition, your attempt to portray a significant portion of <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> as &quot;supporters of the oligarchy&quot; is disingenuous at best. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>This is a new thing that developed after the 2016 election.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>From the perspective of a <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> user since the beginning, and a veteran mod, what happened after 2016 was a flood of &quot;mainstream&quot; reddit users into <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>, and that includes <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a>, <a href="/r/the_donald">/r/the_donald</a> and everything in between.</p>

<p>As a result, the mods and veteran/genuine users here have had to defend this turf with increasing determination, as these &quot;mainstream&quot; reddit users tend to attack our ability to hold any significant discussion on certain topics.</p>

<p>What&#39;s most striking is the <em>absence</em> of discussion now...we are being forced to pick sides, and yet the conspiracy theorist has traditionally resisted being pigeonholed by mainstream narratives.</p>

<p>The other two just seem like business as usual as well, however this phrasing turns me off:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>meanwhile taking Russian Rubles to propagate disinformation</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Facebook has always been chock to the brim with corporate/government sponsored disinfo, so your singling out Russia over this appears more influenced by mainstream conspiracy theories than reality, but that&#39;s just my skeptical nature.</p>

<p>TBH, the scrutiny over Trump and politics in general has done a great service in waking up a significant portion of the population, but my concern is that these conspiracy neophytes will have their naivety weaponized against them by the same oligarchic interests that have been calling the shots for generations.</p>

It appears to me more as information comes out that there was &#39;Russian collusion.&#39; You may disagree, but we could probably agree that the Russian connection was not the main thing gaming the 2016 election.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>I wish I could believe this, but it never seems to amount to anything. The post 2016 election situation seems quite a bit like what happened after the Supreme Court handed down its edict on the 2000 election. Despite all the outrage and the waking up then, GWB still wound up sitting there for eight years, six of those with a compliant Republican Congress. The backsliding has not been corrected to this day.</p>

<p>We may have been mistaken. It may not be the waking up that will make change, but rather a few actual victories to help morale.</p>

<p>We keep getting further in the hole in a pattern that started when Richard Nixon campaigned against the Vietnam War then widened it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My technique when presenting an idea in response to a mainstream media news article was always to preface the statement with the words &quot;Conspiracy Theory -&quot; before posting a fun little statement of a possible alternative to the narrative. Seemed to always work for me. That way everyone involved, no matter where they came from or why, understands that I&#39;m not presenting my idea as a 100% statement of fact... just an interesting possibility. That seems to encourage more productive discussion because it keeps it entirely in the theoretical realm. </p>

<p>A lot of people come to this sub to fight with people whom they belive are ignorant and wrong... and you can&#39;t blame them cause a lot of users here present their conspiracy theories as factual reality... too much conspiracy not enough theory. Legit users are fine with you calling a conspiracy theory a conspiracy theory... and the people that are here just to argue are placated by the fact that you called your idea by the term that was invented just for that purpose.</p>

<p>Willfully labeling your statements as a &quot;Conspiracy Theory&quot; right up front gets all the arguing out of the way and seems to encourage a better conversation about &quot;What If?&quot;... I know this should go without saying on a conspiracy sub... it&#39;s right there in the sidebar.... but I found it helped out a lot to keep everything strictly theoretical. No one should ever be 100% sure about anything.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ok browsed a bit through your history. and the reason is that you are more into the Political end of conspiracies. Which i try to avoid, because everybody is fucking crazy now. Doesnt even matter on who s side you are on. Both sides have great examples on how the other is just nutty and vile....because both sides kinda are. Political discourse has suffered immensely in the past couple of years.</p>

<p>While i am into stuff and mostly post about stuff that is arguably less emotional. Alien life, UFO technology and such. Very few people have strong opinions on those. </p>

<p>Furthermore you are a mod. If you like it or not, you represent with your presence this sub and its general mood. If the mood shifts towards the political right, people from the left hate you. If it shifts left, the right hates you.    </p>

<p>Im in a country where i generally dont have the right of free speech (i still say whatever i want, but on some topics i simply cant post) so while i personally have my own opinions (which for the most part dont intersect with yours) i am quite glad this kind of places exist. So i guess we gotta live with the brigading until the general Political mood has calmed down....</p>

<p>...or we start murdering each other over them. </p>

<p>One of the above i guess. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think the people that have <em>willful</em> (that being the key word) openness and like to actually think about subjects moved to that sub. That doesn&#39;t mean that they accept shit without question (I haven&#39;t noticed that yet, but was turned to that sub a few days ago) as you kind of <em>have</em> to regarding some subject matter - but this sub turned into like politics or the donald compared to what it was when I first started reading on here.</p>

<p>This sub seems to be filled with people who don&#39;t know the term &quot;conspiracy <em>theory</em>&quot; and make fun of people that try to post. And then the interesting stories get buried due to media links, etc. </p>

<p>Just because our government is 80% conspiracies (obviously over exaggerating, in case you can&#39;t tell) doesn&#39;t mean I don&#39;t want to read about UFO&#39;s or Antarctica or some crazy off the wall shit. That&#39;s what I come here to read. Now I go to C_S_T to read crazy shit and read comments on Conspiracy to see how downhill our society is really going.</p>

<p>Just being honest =/</p>

<p>If you see the world as only one way, well, that&#39;s how it&#39;s going to look. You can&#39;t change people like that so you might as well try to teach them instead of belittle them. (I&#39;m not talking about you, just the vibe of this &quot;community&quot; is <strong>not</strong> what it used to be i.e. supportive for the most part- no matter the subject matter)</p>

<p>So therefore if you ever have what you feel is a profound thought, these guys &quot;entertain it&quot; by forcefully engaging in polite conversation that builds upon it. </p>

<p>In other words, it&#39;s a safe space. I actually have not checked to see if my personal opinions are protected. I would hope so.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t see how this is any more of a &quot;safe space&quot; than any other subreddit. Rest assured that there are dozens of other subs that will protect your opinions, if that&#39;s what you&#39;re looking for.</p>

<p>I visit C_S_T irregularly and have found some great discussion there along witn a good portion of discussion I don&#39;t care about. You haven&#39;t demonstrated at all the poisonous nature of their philosophy.

<p>I will definitely concede it&#39;s a distinction for a subreddit to acknowledge in its own sidebar (I admit i overlooked that). That said, the absence of this statement doesn&#39;t prevent other subreddits from becoming any less of safe spaces in practice</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah the Russian investigation might have died out if it weren&#39;t for literal shills attacking the conspiracy in this forum and other media.</p>

<p>Actual race baiting nazi wannabes seemly don&#39;t get banned around this place either. It&#39;s basic divide and conquer for those folks. One day we are all the same blood, there&#39;s no left and right but the white race is better and the creation of a child of mixed race is a genocide.</p>

<p>But here we are... I&#39;ll contribute what my logic tells me. Everything seems like an elaborate ploy to gain control of the culture because posts like this attack the sub itself. That&#39;s why I use comedy (well it&#39;s funny to me) to deal with the blatant shilling going on for the president.</p>

<p>You&#39;re calling for people to comment more. What if more liberals more than conservatives take you up on that offer? Is the offer gone now?</p>

<p>Trump has brought his conspiracies mainstream. Every single Trump conspiracy has been covered by these &quot;liberal networks&quot;. That&#39;s why liberals seem so informed by every instance and able to take down conservative shills with ease.</p>

<p>Conservatives are always on the back foot and when they are about to fall they bring up how they will slaughter unarmed people in the streets because guns. Or they&#39;ll just use divide and conquer to divide people by race because they believe one is superior and sacrosanct. </p>

<p>The defending of Trump has gotten to an apex by plastering the Trump &quot;spy&quot; on the side and we just can&#39;t even deny it anymore.
Investigating traitorous criminals is not a crime. Talking to a known informant is retarded. Why aren&#39;t we talking about that? Who let the CIA man in? Are we seriously just glossing over details so </p>

<p>There&#39;s a reason &quot;liberal&quot; networks are so confident to run everything pushed by Trump. </p>

<p>Believe it or not, it is not a virtue to entertain a thought even if you disagree. An educated mind would entertain the thought by giving it validity and commenting on it. Doesn&#39;t mean blindly accept without any rebuttal. </p>

<p>There&#39;s pretty obvious favoritism and unchecked shilling from the right. You&#39;re going to cause problems continuing down this path. I&#39;ve never seen a single accusation of shilling from the right from you. You&#39;ll just accepted every opinion, every lie as fact.</p>

<p>The political ideals are a real thing. Nothing will change that. Some people are against the idea of &quot;food stamps&quot;.

<p>It&#39;s actually linking to a thread that is basically saying Trump is just being spied on. I&#39;m asking the real questions. if he was so easy to find out why was anyone even talking to him? How was he even allowed in the campaign?</p>

<p>Maybe he was allowed in so they could frame Obama and the letter agencies... duh duh duhhhhhh uncovered a conspiracy. The article doesn&#39;t even describe what he was doing in the Trump campaign.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is how you know you&#39;re dealing with shills vs regular people who are, for some reason, being &quot;skeptical&quot;.  I know the flat earth theory is absolute bullshit and a distraction.  Though, I do not go far out of my way to head over to their sub and heckle, cajole, harass and banter endlessly with their group of believers.  There is simply no need, I don&#39;t subscribe to that idea, why would I seek them out?  They can think what they like.  Posting and commenting in their area in a way only serves to legitimize their bullshit and gives them reason to carry on.  They should be ignored out of existence, in my opinion.  </p>

<p>The reverse works for the shills and bullshitters.  They, for some &quot;reason&quot;, seek us out only to hassle and be contrarians to the entire sub, either for the hell of it, or with an intended goal in mind.  To disrupt us.  They could just let us believe and think whatever ways we like, especially when the ideas are just simple thoughts and theories, yet here they are!  Only in an attempt to sway someone&#39;s opinion and dissuade them from considering such opinions and theories or to shame people from thinking that way in the first place.</p>

<p>Either they have a legitimate/defensible argument against an idea or they here to fuck with people.  Even if they have what they consider to be a legit argument against, they also don&#39;t need to be here to stop others from thinking how they like.</p>

<p>No, they have no means to combat the positive effect of the voting of legitimate conspiracy theorists, hence the apparent incongruity you&#39;ve mentioned.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree. I saw the earlier post about MH17 and the news story and thought to myself, Russia to blame for Skripals, Russia to blame for so-called Syria chemical weapons attack, Russia meddling in US election, now Russia to blame for MH17 downing which to me appeared to be just a not so subtle reminder of what we had already been told a year or two earlier and which was also a news story that if you didn’t read it carefully might lead you to think it was saying that the weapon was used from a Russian base on Russian land (because it was, after it had been delivered to rebels in the Ukraine...see what I mean, how those words can be read two ways) and like you I am not saying the Russians aren’t necessarily guilty of at least some of these things, but it does seem to be a little bit like it possibly could be a coordinated propaganda action....BUT although I thought about posting about this I decided not to, because generally if I do try to post about such things my post gets immediately buried or if I comment with kind of thought process I just get told I am a Russian sympathiser or folks/bots make comments that don’t really take further discussion anywhere.
I don’t know who’s telling the most truth but I do like exploring whether those that we are supposed to be able to trust might be lying through their teeth. It’s not about sympathising with the Russians, shit I even consider that perhaps the Russians are stirring things up intentionally to make us think our governments are trying to convince us to hate them(!), I’d just like to discuss all sides and aspects of events to explore what possible scenarios exist and it confounds me that people feel the need to downvote or immediately dismiss any ideas...if that’s just organic then I wish everyone would lighten up and become more open &amp; as I said explore ideas, &amp; the potential motivations of all of the actors, just investigate who could benefit depending on which slant of a story is believed but more &amp; more I feel like maybe intentional &amp; coordinated efforts are being made to make such discussions impossible.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You can&#39;t win against them Axo, so don&#39;t bother. I think the majority of the users in this sub know what you&#39;re saying - and I agree, this place is and has been for exploring alternative viewpoints from the mainstream media. Any official narrative can be spun as a conspiracy as well and can land itself in this sub. Now obviously a mainstream narrative can be a legitimate conspiracy, but a conspiracy pushed by the mainstream media is always one we should all question.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not really surprised why many users of this sub would never believe an extraterrestrial disclosure if it was coming from the very people that were lying to them for countless years . That is why the Blue Beam theory gained its popularity in the first place and why even people that do believe in extraterrestrial involvement and presence on this planet would likely raise their eyebrows ever so slightly if CNN was suddenly started talking about aliens visiting this planet. Even if it were true, any such narrative could be spun out of control and filled with misinformation once it was &quot;purified&quot; by the mainstream narrative and made ready for public consumption. Even I myself, as a person that loves to dabble with fringe theories about aliens and whatnot, and as someone that does thing that some form of extraterrestrial presence is likely, wouldn&#39;t be too easy to accept any story about it fed to me by the BBC or what have you. It&#39;s just the nature of conspiracies as an alternative view from the mainstream narrative - not necessarily correct every time, but nonetheless necessary in a world where one voice (usually the loudest, wealthiest and most powerful in the worldly sense) so often drowns out everything else.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>conspiracy has been a heavily targeted thread for propagandists and just the general dis-illusionists. At the same time, it attracts like minded people like you and me to connect in a forum. It sucks to work with, but by ignoring &quot;the phonies&quot; (some catcher in the rye for ya) we can still get points across the world. It&#39;s hard to see the most liked posts in the sub be just a bunch of bullshit. and to see real ideas get down voted on a constant basis. But those numbers have no indication of what minds you&#39;ve actually touched. 
Personally I love to look at threads by sorting by controversial. Maybe a few are actually bad posts, but sometimes their funny enough to make you laugh, and than others seem to be the real comments. Best and top are very curated results that never represent the real community. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think the people that have <em>willful</em> (that being the key word) openness and like to actually think about subjects moved to that sub. That doesn&#39;t mean that they accept shit without question (I haven&#39;t noticed that yet, but was turned to that sub a few days ago) as you kind of <em>have</em> to regarding some subject matter - but this sub turned into like politics or the donald compared to what it was when I first started reading on here.</p>

<p>This sub seems to be filled with people who don&#39;t know the term &quot;conspiracy <em>theory</em>&quot; and make fun of people that try to post. And then the interesting stories get buried due to media links, etc. </p>

<p>Just because our government is 80% conspiracies (obviously over exaggerating, in case you can&#39;t tell) doesn&#39;t mean I don&#39;t want to read about UFO&#39;s or Antarctica or some crazy off the wall shit. That&#39;s what I come here to read. Now I go to C_S_T to read crazy shit and read comments on Conspiracy to see how downhill our society is really going.</p>

<p>Just being honest =/</p>

<p>If you see the world as only one way, well, that&#39;s how it&#39;s going to look. You can&#39;t change people like that so you might as well try to teach them instead of belittle them. (I&#39;m not talking about you, just the vibe of this &quot;community&quot; is <strong>not</strong> what it used to be i.e. supportive for the most part- no matter the subject matter)</p>

<p>It&#39;s the philosophy of &quot;muh downvotes&quot; and that everyone must and should conform to the content you are viewing without opposition. That&#39;s the overwhelming thing I read on every post. A discussion is just a discussion and not much dissent from most posts I&#39;ve seen.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>That&#39;s only in a [Premise] post</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yeah. And that is what conspiracies are based on.</p>

<p>Obviously you can&#39;t agree with everything, but it&#39;s the theme of acceptance. A culture of acceptance not to mention breaking the rules for premise in this post <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/C_S_T/comments/8kwbm7/race_mixing_and_being_one_future_human_race/">https://www.reddit.com/r/C_S_T/comments/8kwbm7/race_mixing_and_being_one_future_human_race/</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>I downvote this user because he comes off as a real jerk. I&#39;m not part of any if the things he thinks are after him, I&#39;m just a dude. I liked the premise of this post, so i click it amd scroll down to see this dude at it again. Just being a jerk to everyone. I didn&#39;t even know he could ban people, yikes. Anyways, I just wanted to chime in and say there probably are plenty of regular people like me downvoting him just for being kind of an ass. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t know if they went or not. Generally there are more pressing subjects to study, but from what I&#39;ve looked over I can appreciate why there is doubt about this.</p>

<p>One thing seems very clear. There was false film and video produced, more than likely. The question shouldn&#39;t be whether we went or not, but why would they feel the need to produce false video? To what end?</p>
