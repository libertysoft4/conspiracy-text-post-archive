        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>So starting a week ago my phone has been slow at work. I thought it was just my service being bad but it only happens at work. Yesterday I sent two messages to my SO complaining about my job. First was a complaint about how the temperature is cold because my boss is overweight.</p>

<p>He later walks by me and makes a comment &quot;feel the air yet?&quot;. </p>

<p>I thought that was weird but brushed it off. Maybe he heard me complain to another colleague about it.</p>

<p>Then I sent my SO another message saying I wish someone would shoot me and put me out of my misery. That was private, never discussed with anyone except my SO through that text.</p>

<p>Well this morning my boss made a comment seemingly out of nowhere saying &quot;did you bring your gun?&quot; I said no and walked away but he&#39;s obviously telling me he&#39;s reading my messages.</p>

<p>First off, this is my personal phone. I don&#39;t have a company phone. Secondly, I never use the Wi-Fi in the office. Is he really spying on me? I tried looking it up online and it seems that this isn&#39;t technically illegal but not legal either. </p>

<p>What should I do? What can I do?</p>

<p>Apologies in advance if this isn&#39;t the right place for this post but I knew if I posted this in ask reddit most people would be like &quot;That&#39;s impossible!&quot;. Thank you in advance.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>First of all, your boss is spying on you. Period. That&#39;s a huge part of what they do, for various reasons. Second, he&#39;s probably not tapping your phones, as that is a serious charge. He is most likely equipping the place with sophisticated cameras and microphones. We have cameras at my work that can listen a long distance and zoom in to read a cellphone screen.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is the best advice.</p>

<p>When you&#39;re a powerless peon VS the unleashed apparatus of inscrutable technical total surveillance, what can you do?</p>

<p>Diddly squat.</p>

<p>But there is one thing you and any victim of gang stalking can always do to strike back.</p>

<p>Jam the gears of surveillance with bullshit.</p>

<p>They wanna watch? Fine. Put on a good show. Give them what they think they want.</p>

<p>Which is why every morning I have long and detailed text message conversations with my ISIS cell handler. Then I text my Mexican Cartel handler about the new shippments of coke and the names of snitches to whack. Finally I text my pedo cell to coordinate the shipping and caging of lil&#39; Pizzas in preparation of next weeks orgy.</p>

<p>Of course none of it is true. But if I can force TPTB to waste a million dollars in man hours per year paying a closer look on me, only to chase their tails in the end, I have done the best I can to Bleed The Beast.</p>

<p>There&#39;s a pretty big unexpected consequence of watching everyone: 99% of your efforts will be wasted on false positives.</p>

<p>If none of that works for you, you can always murder yoyr boss and hide hus body in the nearest swamp bog.</p>

<p>Good luck!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That was just speculation. Just cause a phone slows down, doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s hacked. Many possibilities.  Truth is though, companies spy on their employees.

- high def cameras
- message app passwords phished / hacked -- or password same as company account password
- stingray-like device intercepting messages</p>

<p>I would begin preparing for employment elsewhere, I would also be straightforward and ask about it. Mention that you&#39;ve sent some messages related to the content of your conversation and would like to know if your phone has been compromised.

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re being spied on through your phone, or your SO talks to your boss.</p>

<p>The same exact thing happened to me. Someone put spyware on my phone and was tracking my location, making hidden calls to eavesdrop, reading my text, and so on.</p>

<p>This is what you need to do OP. FORMAT your phone. Wipe it. </p>

<p>In theory, this should remove the spyware. After you do this, DO NOT ACCEPT ATTACHMENTS THROUGH TEXT MESSAGES. For example if your SO sends you a sexy pic, don&#39;t open it. On most phones it has it so that it automatically downloads attachments on text messages, turn this off. </p>

<p>Most service providers let other people track you, for example, AT&amp;T&#39;s Device Help, and some feature that lets you be part of the family tracking feature. Disable these.</p>

<p>Buy a cheap phone if you can afford it, and use it for clandestine communication with people you trust. You can buy a cheap throwaway phone at MetroPCS, for example. </p>

<p>Is your SO talking to your boss? Tell her something about work IN PERSON, away from your phone, and see if he hints at it.</p>

<p>If you do suspect your phone has spyware, file a police report.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ok so if his boss has no way of knowing his sim number which delivers his messages  due to him not having mobile management and doesn’t have a clone of his sim to duplicate sms over network and he doesn’t have any company stuff to monitor his device and he isn’t accessing company portals with his device, how do you gather his nobody boss is tracking him? </p>

<p>I’m not discrediting since we don’t have all the info but it would be fairly impossible for someone to just “hack” his messages without having access to his messaging account, without an MDM, and without an illegal sim duplicate </p>

<p>It’s also very unlikely that his boss created some random app that he downloaded and now gives him access to info on his phone </p>

<p>Do your job as best you can and try to not focus a lot or get emotional about the harassment, btw I been targeted for 10+ years and tortured everyday for about 2 years with remote influencing tech that causes painful sensations in my body in Iran just wanna make people aware this is happening globally, good luck.</p>

<p>Turability
Th€ phenomenon is tunable in that the characteristic sounds and intansities ofthose
sounds depend on the characteristics ofthe RF energy as delivered. Because the
ftequency ofthe sound heard is dep€ndent on the pulse chamcteristics ofthe RF energy,
it seems possible that this technology could be developed to the point where words could
be hansmitted to be heard like the spoken wod, excepthat it could only bo heard within
a person&#39;s head. In one experiment, communication ofthe words from one to ten using
&quot;speech modulated&quot; microwave energy was successfully demonstrated. Microphones next
to the p€rson experiencing the voice could not pick up the sound. Additional develonncnt
ofthis would open up a wide range ofpossibilities.    </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This would mean that the human body has a developed a way to receive and understand radio frequencies without the use of any technology whatsoever. Do you see how ridiculous that is? </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Guy says that experiments have demonstrated that radiation at 40 microjoules per pulse per square centimeter produces sound at zero decibels, which is just barely in hearing range. To produce sound at 60 decibels, or the sound of normal conversation, requires 40 watts per square centimeter of radiation. ”That would kill you pretty fast,” Guy says.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So even if it was POSSIBLE, there&#39;s no way that some random dude is just walking around and they are blasting radio waves directed ONLY at him, without the use of giant equipment. He&#39;d more or less have to be in a soundproof room to even hear what the RF signal is broadcasting towards him. </p>

<p>You still need energy to &quot;simulate the experience&quot;. This energy still follows physical laws. Unless this guy was hooked up to it directly, this energy would need to be huge and concentrated to ONLY affect him. It would be way more damaging than just hearing a voice in your head.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Show your source. You haven&#39;t shown any source yet. </p>

<p>From what I&#39;ve read Radio frequency can stimulate bone and nerve tissue around your ear, which vibrates and creates a sound inside your ear. But that vibration is so small that it&#39;s barely audible, and wouldn&#39;t be able to accurately represent words or a conversation. </p>

<p>If they were focusing a beam directly at someone, they have to be insanely accurate with their direction to hit the specific spot of their brain to cause this to happen. You understand that&#39;s ridiculously difficult? Especially from far enough away to not be detected by the person experiencing it. Ultrasound and MRI is pretty difficult to do even applied directly to the skin. </p>

<p>Without physical access to the mobile device, how could the boss possibly be spying on that communication?

<p>Here is what I recommend you do;</p>

<p>Hard wipe your phone. </p>

<p>Have a serious conversation with your SO about what’s going on. Don’t accuse them of anything, but let them know you believe your private conversations with them are being compromised. If it’s really happening, you are both victims.</p>

<p>Involve a trusted third party, like maybe one of your parents, and complain about your boss to them via text.</p>

<p>Remember! Do not use the WiFi.</p>

<p>If the behavior continues and you really feel he is watching or spying on you, switch to Signal and contact a lawyer. </p>

<p>Last resort, email someone at the EFF. </p>

14) You are being set up as a patsy and your boss is implanting suggestions in your mind
15) The staff canteen has laced their lunchtime baguettes with LSD
16) There is a secret door in an office block somewhere which allows people to inhabit your body for a short period of time before being dumped out of the sky next to a local highway intersection and your boss knows where this door is
17) Your boss is an annunaki descendant who can shapeshift into a lizard and ALSO read your mind

<p>Define slow. Most methods of interception wouldn&#39;t make your phone slow per se. The implication is slow = virus = spying. That&#39;s probably the most implausible of the possibilities. You&#39;re not the kind of person that leaves your phone lying around are you?</p>

<p>We have union work groups, another manager once put a cute little &quot;no complaints zone&quot; sign on her desk. An employee contacted the NLRB and said his rights were violated by the sign . We were fined and had to prove that the sign was removed.</p>

<p>Come on man. Read your own post. Let alone the source of &quot;slave.org&quot;, wouldnt this be a major scientific breakthrough? Whoever discovered this would have gotten a nobel prize. </p>

<p>Why would some &quot;shadow gov&quot; or group be targeting some fucking random dude? Do you even know how much dedication that would take? To set up equipment everywhere he goes BEFORE he gets there and him not see it? SO many people would have to be involved just to fuck with him. The logistics alone prove that hes a fucking loon. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not sure what size company your company is or any of the details of it. This might not be relevant.</p>

<p>The largest SV companies are well know to have internal intelligence/counter-intelligence divisions to squash leaks. At Apple people even end up working on fake products to prove themselves.</p>

<p>Now, you&#39;re company probably isn&#39;t that size. At the same time, if you&#39;re using company resources to say something, you should expect that the company is monitoring it. Now there are power hungry creeps who are monitoring it real time and looking for juicy gossip. This may be where you work. On the other hand, I&#39;ve worked at companies where they don&#39;t really give a shit about what you&#39;re doing as long as it&#39;s not coming back to haunt the company. If it does? They have 18 months worth of complete logs of all sorts of stuff available in order to research what might be going on. If they have reason to or the logs turn up something, there is additional monitoring to be turned on. A lot of this is actually a legal requirement to fulfill certain audits necessary for certain types of business (handling third-party data, money, medical documents, etc..)</p>

<p>The question is not is this possible, but whether it&#39;s being abused.</p>

<p>If you suspect it is being abused? Start looking for another job, but don&#39;t use any company resources to do so. Don&#39;t complain yet. Start keeping daily records of things that happen. The better you can timestamp and log it, the better our case later. You really don&#39;t want to have to come to that, as though you might win, that kind of battle can&#39;t last longer than you expected and drain you.</p>

<p>So yeah, assume company resources are being monitored. If you can tell that&#39;s being abused, use not compnay resources to find a new job.</p>

<p>If it&#39;s not company resources? Either he is hacking you (doubtful), has another source of the information you don&#39;t expect (people would be surprised at how much info they leak), or you&#39;re being paranoid.</p>

<p>No matter which one of those, get out. If it ends up repeating at the next place, it might just be you and consider that with the help of the professional. I&#39;m not trying to say that, that&#39;s sort of the last possibility, but anything is possible.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is the best advice.</p>

<p>When you&#39;re a powerless peon VS the unleashed apparatus of inscrutable technical total surveillance, what can you do?</p>

<p>Diddly squat.</p>

<p>But there is one thing you and any victim of gang stalking can always do to strike back.</p>

<p>Jam the gears of surveillance with bullshit.</p>

<p>They wanna watch? Fine. Put on a good show. Give them what they think they want.</p>

<p>Which is why every morning I have long and detailed text message conversations with my ISIS cell handler. Then I text my Mexican Cartel handler about the new shippments of coke and the names of snitches to whack. Finally I text my pedo cell to coordinate the shipping and caging of lil&#39; Pizzas in preparation of next weeks orgy.</p>

<p>Of course none of it is true. But if I can force TPTB to waste a million dollars in man hours per year paying a closer look on me, only to chase their tails in the end, I have done the best I can to Bleed The Beast.</p>

<p>There&#39;s a pretty big unexpected consequence of watching everyone: 99% of your efforts will be wasted on false positives.</p>

<p>If none of that works for you, you can always murder yoyr boss and hide hus body in the nearest swamp bog.</p>

<p>Good luck!</p>
