    <div class="md"><p>Literally just searching “superbug” on google gives you information on the issue. The conspiracy isn’t based on how the info isn’t available to the general public, but rather why it’s not even a talking point or platform policy amongst our supposed “representatives” in government, especially in America, the number one abuser of market-grade medicine in the globe. Read the book Missing Microbes if you really want to understand how we’re mistreating our gut microbiome and how the plagues of the future are the product of our own ignorant consumption.</p>

I’m sure there are lots of other important issues that are being addressed by science et al that are not discussed much here, likely due to the knowledge needed to discuss it intelligently and in depth, unless, of course, you are a microbiologist, are you?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So on the notion that there are more important things to worry about, you&#39;re dismissing his claim as ignorant.  Then you top off with an appeal to authority.  You are ignoring the point altogether.</p>

<p>It&#39;s being discussed as a problem; the question is why.  As you say if there are other things to worry about they&#39;re keeping it quiet.  The fact that this superbug is a threat at all is suspicious.  How would anyone know for sure? (Keep in mind <a href="http://www.thedogpress.com/editorials/Plum-island-LymeDisease_Andrews1.asp">plum island</a>, specifically how Lyme disease was likely manufactured in a lab and released as a test.)</p>

<p>The media is owned by 5 companies- so the idea that we have nothing to worry about at all based on what we hear from the media, is absolutely naive.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I’m not dismissing his claim as ignorant, I’m saying most people on the sub are probably not well versed in microbiology and likely don’t have much to say on the subject, thus explaining why it is not widely discussed here. That doesn’t stop those like yourself who are knowledgeable from discussing it.
Why is a superbug suspicious? I thought it was the result of overuse of antibiotics. Where did I say we have nothing to worry about at all? I would never claim that due to my lack of knowledge on the subject, so please stop putting words in my mouth.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This issue isn’t just another cancer. Another ebola. Another HIV/AIDS. Another prostate cancer. Right at this very moment, diseases far more deadly and resistant than anything humanity has ever dealt with in history are being engineered right in the home of the average American, of who, as a product of our culture of excess and ignorance, excessively consumes market-grade medicine instead of applying for prescription care or professional medical consulation because “it’s worked before, it must work now!” It might. But it won’t work for your children. Or their children. The generations after them, too. This sub has been so busy mulling over cases which I personally find to be 1) incredibly small scale and 2) completely out of touch of reality. I know you guys aim to improve the world by discussing big ideas not normally tackled by the average informed citizen, and that’s commendable. But here’s an issue that, regardless of whether or not we discuss it here in what can be described as excessive detail, will affect us, and potentially threatens humanity. This is legit scary.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have been Warning about this since 2009.</p>

<p>While i personally know nobody that disagrees (except Full Nutters) nobody actually does anything. The fault lies within the Pharma industry. But this time they are the victim if you believe it or not.</p>

<p>Making a new Antibiotic is as of now a mostly Suicidal endeavor for a  Company. Even the Mega coorperations can be hit hard by that. Even if the Antibiotic is the best thing since sliced bread. The reasons for that are multiple.</p>

<p>Its extremly expensive, before being approved for human testing you have to have made a very wide and long array of animal tests. Not just your common cheapo clone mice. Nah nah nah, you need the big fuckers. Monkeys and Apes often. That is really really expensive. Furthermore developing costs of the drug itself. You need to hire literally indiana jones type fellows who venture in the jungle and explore caves to get samples to find antibiotics where nature hasnt found a way around them yet (secluded regions) Isolating it and figuring out a way for mass production is fucking tough and really expensive.</p>

<p>Then you gotta deal with the Human Trials. I was never really involved in those but from what i have been told they have to be Massive! </p>

<p>So from start to finish (approval) you gotta spend money in the region of 2-6 BILLION Dollars (fucking billions!!!).</p>

<p>Then you can make money? Nah A! Nope no money for you. Sure every hospital wanna have a stock of your new fancy mega antibiotic, but they will hardly be used. Since a new Broad spectrum antibiotic is a &quot;In Emergency only&quot; Antibiotic. The reason is to limit exposure. Over many years this may pay off especially when other antibiotics fail. But for a Pharma company making a Antibiotic is a HUGE gamble. Especially since given the development costs, patent protection is pretty short, so companies will make that new antibiotic impossibly expensive ...</p>

<p>So its often better to just keep the ideas handy but focus on bonerpills and Hypertension medication. </p>

<p>A way out of this dilemma is a massive reform. Creating a Ministry of Microbiology. Which is concerned with the Research, testing and Manufacture of Antibiotics, Antivirals etc. I have been pushing for that for a while and again...everybody agrees, but nobody does.</p>

<p>Another approach is Personalized medicine in Form of Phage therapy. Phage therapy can in many cases (If done right!) replace or supplement Antibiotics. The problem is that currently in medschool (as far as i remember) phages are mentioned on ONE (!!!) page and given half a class for introduction and general overview.</p>

<p>Phage ecology, phage production and breeding is massively complex and it definitely needs a specialist on site for it to be of benefit. That requires investment and training from hospitals, universities and the government furthermore patentlaw needs to be changed. Currently its not really possible to patent a phage (for various really mindbreaking reasons....insane topic).</p>

<p>In short, if we dont act and supply industry with leniency, change laws and regulations and train personal...we will look towards a Post Antibiotic Era. (which is a Doomsday scenario in our Hyperconnected time).</p>

<p>Sorry for the rambling post, the words literally flew onto the keyboard, Im not a native english speaker aswell, so excuse if its hard to understand. But its a topic near and dear to my heart.</p>

<p>A Handgun also kills 100% of cancer cells in a Petrydish. In your body silver is very quickly seperated from the antibiotic and 30% of it will permanently be deposited in your tissues combining with other molecules. The problem is after a certain threshold has been reached UV exposure will turn you blue or gray (argyria), <strong>Permanently</strong>. So unless you like the look, i would not mix it with silver. </p>
