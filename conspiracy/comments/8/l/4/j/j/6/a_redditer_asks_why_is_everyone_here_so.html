    <div class="md"><p>You are so terribly wrong in every regard.</p>

<p>Firstly, the Holocaust did happen. It was confirmed upon the liberation of the camps and end of WWII, and no real evidence has risen since then to prove that it never happened. </p>

<p>Also, the &quot;because it happened 70 years ago, it didnt matter&quot; argument is bs. Your mother or grandmother was born 70 years ago. You cant just say that something doesn&#39;t matter because it did not occur within, or chronologically near your own life. </p>

<p>Finally, Jews are not evil. I don&#39;t know how you were raised or what social circles you are engaged in that have caused you to think this way, but Jews just want to live their lives individually. Same as everyone. There is no global Jewish web looking to keep folks like u/Aoip2337 underneath them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Do I believe the Nazi&#39;s hated the Jews? Yes. They blamed them for their failed revolution and hated Socialism, which had huge Jewish influences at the time.</p>

<p>Do I believe the Nazi&#39;s may have rounded up Jews? Yes</p>

<p>Do I believe some of them died after being put in camps? Yes</p>

<p>Do I believe some of them may have even be killed for various reasons? Absolutely.</p>

<p>Do I also believe the 6 million dead number? No, because it always changing, hard to put a number on and they would have had to have been killing at an insane pace to meet that number.</p>

<hr/>

<p>This is what happened.</p>

<p>They did round up some Jews and put them into camps. Not only out of dislike for them, but due to the threat of Russia who no doubt would have used them to stir shit up like they did with the blacks leading to the Civil Rights Act in the US. </p>

<p>Wars come at a hefty price tag and losing wars make it even worse. When the Nazi&#39;s started losing the war, the conditions in the various camps got bad because they simply didn&#39;t have the food and desperately needed their production. And quite simply, Jewish camp conditions were their last concern. I don&#39;t think the cold winters of those years helped either and likely worsened already bad conditions.</p>

<p>We know what happens when tons of people of various levels of health are grouped together. They get sick and spread disease, creating even worse conditions.</p>

<hr/>

<p>The actions of Jewish people after that only point towards a greater conspiracy. How did the Jews, a group who wasn&#39;t even in WW2, end up winning themselves a whole nation out of it? It makes no sense. I didn&#39;t see the UK and British rushing to create a state for Armenian&#39;s after WW1.</p>

<p>Making Holocaust denial illegal always raises further questions. Why would denying that an event happened be considered a criminal action? It makes it seem like there is something to hide.</p>

<p>Whataboutism doesn&#39;t prove anything: why was Pol Pot ______, you can fill in your own theory. We can use &quot;whatabout&quot; to justify anything, that is not valid argument. Once again, you only need to read history to find out why Armenian Genocide is dealt the way it wasn&#39;t. but that is totally separate event in history. Had very little if anything to do with events in WWII. like you said, it was not recognized until way after world war 2. It is large stain of shame on many nations.</p>

<p>Because you are horrible, horrible humanbeing that denies the suffering of millions and most likely want to repeat it. Your idea is based on that Jews still are allowed to exist. ISN&#39;T IT? and you want to find justification for that irrational hate? RIGHT? Don&#39;t pretend this is academic interest since if it truly was: you would not deny holocaust you sack of puss.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve seen estimates of various amounts. There&#39;s clippings from paper&#39;s of hundreds of thousands to 1-2 million to 6 million to 10 million.</p>

<p>I have no trust for the MSM. It&#39;s almost all Jewish owned anyway and they aren&#39;t neutral about the subject.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Russians and Civil Rights Act? </p>

<p>Look it up. The Russians went to Africa and spread their socialist and communist influences there. The US was afraid they were going to do the same thing to blacks here, which they succeeded in doing. Blacks vote majority democrat and vote for various socialistic policies.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Also, you make it sound like detaining all jews was a good thing, necessary act.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You need unity when you are fighting a war. If you don&#39;t have it, the public opinion of the war is affected and then you have your own enemies fighting a civil war in your own country as well. The Russian&#39;s would have loved to have stirred up the Jews. They would have revolted and rioted and the Nazi&#39;s would have had to have taken action, which would look really bad for their image and public support. The media would have supported the victims and it would have created a civil war within a world war, which is not good.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I forgot where i was for a while.. Yup, conspiracy as in: not a shred of evidence.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I don&#39;t see the fact that Britain refused peace 14 times mentioned very often. I don&#39;t see communism/socialism treated in the same light as Naziism, when it was far more deadly. I see lots of hate for the supposed actions against the Jews, yet I see no one caring about the atom bombing of innocent Japanese. I also never see much talk about post-WW2 Germany where anyone who supported Naziism had bad shit happen to them.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It is all documented. You only need to read.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Oh I read it, and it makes the Jewish NWO seem like a mighty force indeed. No one ever seems to talk about that though. Maybe it&#39;s because the 4 of the 5 big TV companies are jewish owned, 2 of the 3 big music companies are jewish owned and 6 of the 6 big movie companies are jewish owned.</p>

<p>I think the global NWO created the Holohoax to destroy nationalism, spread socialism, destroy any sense of pride in one&#39;s heritage, create a global world government and to wreak havoc in the middle east. Without it, I don&#39;t think this stuff happens. </p>

<p>Do I believe some of them died after being put in camps? Yes</p>

<p>Do I believe some of them may have even be killed for various reasons? Absolutely.</p>

<p>Do I also believe the 6 million dead number? No, because it always changing, hard to put a number on and they would have had to have been killing at an insane pace to meet that number.</p>

<p>This is what happened.</p>

<p>They did round up some Jews and put them into camps. Not only out of dislike for them, but due to the threat of Russia who no doubt would have used them to stir shit up like they did with the blacks leading to the Civil Rights Act in the US.</p>

<p>Wars come at a hefty price tag and losing wars make it even worse. When the Nazi&#39;s started losing the war, the conditions in the various camps got bad because they simply didn&#39;t have the food and desperately needed their production. And quite simply, Jewish camp conditions were their last concern. I don&#39;t think the cold winters of those years helped either and likely worsened already bad conditions.</p>

<p>And therein lies the problem.  The Khazarian tribes have essentially hijacked the term &quot;anti-semetic&quot; to apply only to those groups who protest the Israel state-sponsored terrorism.  Conversely, Israel mowing down Palestinians is NOT viewed by much of the world as Anti-semetic, despite fitting the literal definition.  (Which happens to be by design).

<p>relating to or denoting a family of languages that includes Hebrew, Arabic, and Aramaic and certain ancient languages such as Phoenician and Akkadian, constituting the main subgroup of the Afro-Asiatic family.</p>

<p>relating to the peoples who speak Semitic languages, especially Hebrew and Arabic.</p>

<p>Whether the term &quot;anti-semitic&quot; wrongly excludes non-jewish semites is certainly an interesting and rightful debate, but claiming Jews are non-semitic is just incorrect. Most Jews are taught and speak Hebrew, on different levels, and certainly come from Hebrew traditions and history. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You are so terribly wrong in every regard.</p>

<p>Firstly, the Holocaust did happen. It was confirmed upon the liberation of the camps and end of WWII, and no real evidence has risen since then to prove that it never happened. </p>

<p>Also, the &quot;because it happened 70 years ago, it didnt matter&quot; argument is bs. Your mother or grandmother was born 70 years ago. You cant just say that something doesn&#39;t matter because it did not occur within, or chronologically near your own life. </p>

<p>Finally, Jews are not evil. I don&#39;t know how you were raised or what social circles you are engaged in that have caused you to think this way, but Jews just want to live their lives individually. Same as everyone. There is no global Jewish web looking to keep folks like u/Aoip2337 underneath them.</p>

<p>What number keeps changing? Has it changed from say.. 6 million to 10 000 to 50 million? Or has it been 6 million + 10k or 6 million +-100k. Has the <strong>magnitude</strong> of it changed considerably? Wut? It hasn&#39;t? It has staid largely the same since... end of 1940s?</p>

<p>Not only out of dislike for them, but due to the threat of Russia who no doubt would have used them to stir shit up like they did with the blacks leading to the Civil Rights Act in the US.</p>

<p>WHAT THE ACTUAL FUCK? Russians and Civil Rights Act? Also, you make it sound like detaining all jews was a good thing, necessary act. Like.. Germany was <em>forced</em> to deal with Jews? Revisionist history is not history.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The Allies then used to the various events to create a narrative to protect the Russian&#39;s, protect the US&#39;s image after atom bombing thousands of innocent people, hide the bloodthirstiness of the British and to create a Jewish state. </p>

<p>I forgot where i was for a while.. Yup, conspiracy as in: not a shred of evidence.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>How did the Jews, a group who wasn&#39;t even in WW2, end up winning themselves a whole nation out of it?</p>

<p>It is all documented. You only need to read.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It makes no sense. I didn&#39;t see the UK and British rushing to create a state for Armenian&#39;s after WW1.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Whataboutism doesn&#39;t prove anything: why was Pol Pot ______, you can fill in your own theory. We can use &quot;whatabout&quot; to justify anything, that is not valid argument. Once again, you only need to read history to find out why Armenian Genocide is dealt the way it wasn&#39;t. but that is totally separate event in history. Had very little if anything to do with events in WWII. like you said, it was not recognized until way after world war 2. It is large stain of shame on many nations.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This nation mind you, has led to trillions of dollars spent in stupid wars and caused decades of hell for everyone with hundreds of thousands of deaths.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Irrelevant.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Why would denying that an event happened be considered a criminal action?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Because you are horrible, horrible humanbeing that denies the suffering of millions and most likely want to repeat it. Your idea is based on that Jews still are allowed to exist. ISN&#39;T IT? and you want to find justification for that irrational hate? RIGHT? Don&#39;t pretend this is academic interest since if it truly was: you would not deny holocaust you sack of puss.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Why doesn&#39;t the MSM or history books talk about the positives of Hitler?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Did you honestly just say that Hitler is treted unfairly? After he killed millions of Jews? Oh right, you don&#39;t believr in it when we have noting but confirming research, actual eyewitness accounts counted in MILLIONS. The biggest conspiracy on Earth and somehow no one knows about it.. except fucking neo nazi scum.</p>
