        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p><strong>The incident at grenfell tower resulted in the testing of materials on tower blocks all across the country and shockingly.. &quot;</strong><em>some 300 buildings have been found to be clad in materials that do not meet the current regulatory requirements, in other words, are already banned on those buildings</em><strong>.&quot;</strong></p>

<p><strong>It&#39;s disgusting that we live in a time when saving a little money is worth putting thousands of lives at risk.</strong> </p>

<p><strong>The worst thing is, we wouldn&#39;t even know about this if it wasn&#39;t for those 72 people who lost their lives at grenfell tower.</strong></p>

<p><strong>EMAIL:</strong></p>

<p>The Independent Review of Building Regulations and Fire Safety, undertaken by Dame Judith Hackitt, was published on 17 May 2018. There was also a ministerial statement on the Hackitt Review in the House of Commons, and Dame Judith appeared before the Select Committee.</p>

<p>As expected, the review calls for wide ranging reforms to the system of building regulation in England, and also to the management of higher risk residential buildings during their whole operating life. The report is a once in a generation call for fundamental change in the way that we regulate the construction and operation of buildings, which seeks to address many of the flaws in the system that many in the CIBSE membership have grappled with for many years.
The main report runs to some 100 pages, with many detailed recommendations, including a new regulatory framework. There is an emphasis on viewing buildings as a system, rather than a collection of components. A new “Joint Competent Authority”, will bring together building control, fire and rescue and health and safety functions for higher risk residential buildings over ten storeys in height. This will have powers during both the construction and operation of the building.
A series of gateways to strengthen regulatory oversight of building safety are proposed, from initial planning through to occupation, with formal sign off and stronger change control processes after sign off. This is coupled with a single enforcement regime for these buildings, replacing the current market mechanism for building control with a single system supported by rigorous and enhanced enforcement powers. Creation of a digital record of higher risk buildings will be a requirement.
Clearly defined roles and responsibilities are proposed for dutyholders in these buildings during occupation and a mandatory incident reporting mechanism for safety concerns. Dutyholders will have to present a safety case for approval at regular intervals during the life of the building. Clearer rights for residents are proposed, as well as responsibilities where resident activity can create risks that may affect others.
There are proposals to improve the competence of those in the construction and fire safety sectors, with a new body to provide oversight of competence requirements. There are also proposals to transfer ownership of technical guidance to industry, whilst government retains responsibility for oversight, along with proposals for a clearer package of regulations and guidance that is simpler to navigate whilst reflecting the level of complexity of building work.
There are also recommendations to address poor procurement practices and to drive appropriate behaviour and practice, including a focus on safety and risk and on whole life cost.
There was much coverage in the media yesterday and today on the very specific issue of combustible cladding, with some organisations calling for a “ban” on combustible cladding prior to publication, and therefore study, of the report. This call fails to recognise that since the tragic Grenfell Tower fire some 300 buildings have been found to be clad in materials that do not meet the current regulatory requirements, in other words, are already banned on those buildings.
This clearly demonstrates that, as Dame Judith argues, the current regime is not working effectively to ensure that buildings are safely clad. Without the systemic reforms that Dame Judith proposes, there is no evidence to suggest that altering the current definition of what is banned will have a lasting effect or deliver improved safety. It is very unfortunate that the focus on this single issue appears to have distracted almost all commentary from the much needed overall package of reforms and changes to the way we build and operate high rise dwellings which Dame Judith has proposed.
It is not yet clear how the government will proceed to address the full package of recommendations, but the Secretary of State for Housing, Communities and Local Government yesterday set out the next steps. Government are already consulting on restricting the use of desktop studies, and they have committed to consult on clarification of Approved Document B over the summer. There is also a commitment to consult on “banning the use of combustible materials in cladding systems on high rise residential buildings”.
They have committed to work with industry to improve the user-friendliness of the overall suite of building regulations guidance, work on which CIBSE is already closely involved.
And finally, there is a call for “everyone involved to have their say on how we can achieve [change in culture and practice]”, by the end of July, with a further more detailed statement to parliament in the autumn on how the proposed regulatory system is to be implemented. Once it is clear what this call entails, CIBSE will continue to contribute actively to the ongoing discussion.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thats interesting, thanks for the link. 
It makes no sense to me at all, what is the motivation for risking peoples lives? The only answer i have is to save money. </p>

<p>An alternative answer is to look at this as an intentional risk. The vast majority of people who live in these tower blocks (in the UK) often live in hard times and cant afford a regular home, so they are housed by the government in tower block flats. Its possible the higher classes intentionally put the poors lives at risk with aims to erradicate them. Or its possible its done because the higher classes simply don&#39;t value these lives as much as they would their own. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I am not an engineer, but even I knew that this was fucked-up beyond belief.

    <div class="md"><p>The link in the comment posted by <a href="/u/gematrix">/u/gematrix</a> demonstrates the US is far worse. They have recently relaxed the level of control and regulations on the use of the flammable materials in building cladding. The claim that they won’t save money in the end is probably incorrect. Insurance covers things like this because the building owner is not at blame, the owner didn’t decide what cladding to use, they would have paid a consultants or contracting company to do that for them. Ultimately it’s their responsibility not the landlords </p>

    <div class="md"><p>No one has a greater professional obligation to protect individual and public safety than the architects and engineers that both create and sign-off on the design and plans for buildings, products, tools, etc. etc. and see to it that the all of the specifications are met with any finished items with that safety factor and the best possible margin of safety being their very first priority. </p>

<p>Moreover, virtually all engineering relies on &quot;tried and true&quot; methods with anything new requiring extensive and extreme testing to ensure that it actually is &quot;better&quot; in every respect than whatever is currently approved and available for any specific application.</p>

<p>I find it extremely hard to believe that uncommonly good common sense that all architectural design and engineering itself proceeds from to create what we all rely on in one way or another with a lock-step approach doesn&#39;t apply all the way down the line; or that if there are any ways to deliberately circumvent or sabotage those procedures they can only be  &quot;illegal&quot; and a form of criminal negligence by individuals who all should, in fact, know better with severe penalties and punishments for anyone that would deliberately or intentionally do that for some ulterior motive and gains. </p>

<p>So how, and who was responsible for that cladding being created and what it was created out of, and for what particular applications was it deemed fit and safe to use for that made it available and easy to obtain, in the first place? </p>

<p>Next in line would be the architect, construction company, or the contractor who specified and/or proceeded to purchase and use it without verifying or else ignoring that it wasn&#39;t up to code and suitable for that application.</p>

<p>I think those are the major questions that all need to be addressed first and foremost before worrying about how <em>the system</em> didn&#39;t prevent what clearly appears to be something which could only result from a very blatant &quot;dishonesty&quot; and negligence on any number of people&#39;s part and I think everyone needs and deserves to know who those people are and how that occurred and that they are going to held accountable. </p>

<p>It&#39;s not for any lack of rules, but for someone, somewhere, failing to apply and abide by them.</p>
