I can usually explain a change in my REM/dream pattern by a change in physiological routine; nighttime media viewing; or it&#39;ll be a case of the once in a blue moon crazy vivid dream cycle. </p>

<p>But it has been three days now. Anyone else experiencing an entire different surreal life time during sleep right now?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It’s weird and energizing af. The redos, I remember the prior time (same situation, people, setting) but I have more information so I can play it out differently. The continuation ones are like I got popped back right where I left off and keep going on a different night. Almost always vivid for me (crazy beyond real sometimes). Really kicks up if I have black and white pepper in my food in the evening.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I love dreams. So far Ive had a dream where wife and I (before we were together and barely knew each other) spent years getting to know each other in a dream that directly got us together, spoken with my deceased buddy twice and a middle “man” twice, got advice from my deceased grandfather about what to do and not do, learned crazy secrets about mars were just barely learning about, and about 15 equally crazy real, informative or warning dreams. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I always have very wide-scope, foreboding dreams. The environments are always very open, but clear that they have walls or ceilings, sometimes a hundred meters tall or more.  I have been in strange complexes that felt incredibly isolating and prone to triggering primal fears. The only truly apocalyptic dream I had was where I was standing in a barren wasteland and I saw (vividly) a vulture carrying a deerskin, A CH-56 Chinook made out of bones, and Air Force One except it was shaped more like the Normandy from the Mass Effect series and was clearly a hypersonic craft.</p>

<p>The strangest dreams are those where I travel vast distances, jumping into distant corners of existence to hide from some tireless cosmic apex predator, or weirder yet, where I come to a portal as wide as the sky from the past to the future. I&#39;m frequently floating, or flying, or exploring.</p>

<p>The most recent dreams are hauntingly lucid. I&#39;m checking my belongings for counts and quantities and they remain similar to reality.</p>

<p>I&#39;m of the opinion that we&#39;re essentially standing on the cosmic shore, right before dawn. There&#39;s a bunch of rabbit holes part of an expansive warren, but the set and setting is the beach.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Mars has a thin, breathable atmosphere, no breathing tank is needed unless you work hard or become fatigued. There was a big civilization there in the past but a diminished one lives mostly under the surface now. We already have colonies there. Those are the big points, I wrote down the rest somewhere. Wife and I have been together over 6 years and I had that dream before we were together. Still really clear, sitting around a campfire by a two story cabin with friends of the older sister of my buddy growing up (who I never really talked to). I’ll see if I can find it written down.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Want to hear something crazy but similar?</p>

<p>I used to have dreams about a guy I barely dated years earlier. It would literally leave my heart hurting afterwards, as in the dream I would be madly in love with him. I would brush it under the rug as I was in a relationship and hadn&#39;t seen him in years and figured I never would.</p>

<p>Then years later I ended up running into him and it was basically just like living my dream. Guess I&#39;m still living it because it&#39;s 6 years later now and we are still together 😊 </p>

<p>Bonus: I told him about that dream and he said he had had similar dreams about
Me as well. </p>

<p>Had a lot of thoughts about what a lot of my childhood dreams meant too (I had a lot of reoccurring nightmares as a kid) and they are all making sense now. There&#39;s a part of me that believes that my future/higher resolution self dreams things to tell my present/lower resolution self something.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s interesting my dreams have been especially vivid recently, but ironically the images/symbols in them are now obnoxiously transparent and obvious. I sort of miss the more bizarre inexplicable unrealistic dreams I used to have. </p>

<p>Maybe it just means instead of exploring aimlessly in the dream world someone(s) or something(s) is trying to communicate a more direct message. </p>
