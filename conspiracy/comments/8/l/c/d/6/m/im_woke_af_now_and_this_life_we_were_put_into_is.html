<p>You just described how i still feel sometimes.  Just remember despite it all they can never take the fresh air &amp; sunshine away from you.  Despite all this fucked up shit also remember is you live in the developed world you are currently living in one of the safest/best times in the history of humanity.  Shit really started to go crazy in the 1850’s w/ the robber barrons.  That wasnt that long ago &amp; we are still trying to figure out how to make it better.  It is a constant work in progress.  The internet needs to remain free which is why liberals trying to control acceptable speech on reddit/facebook/twitter/etc is so dangerous.  When i was born this convo you &amp; i are having wasnt possible b/c the internet didnt exist.  Every time you think things are worse dont forget to appreciate all the things in your life that make it easier like central air/heat.  When i see ilthe homeless i do feel sad but life isnt easy for me either but i get my ass up every day to go to work &amp; it fucking blows but i do it.  Dont beat yourself up over things way outside of your control.  Do the best you can every day &amp; just know you are human so you will still have moments where you are not proud of youself.  Life for me is a gift &amp; a curse.  Enjoy as much of it as you can!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is not unfair or untrue, but it provides nothing actionable for a person to run with in order to make a real difference in their own lives. It&#39;s much much easier and much faster to change yourself than to change the entire world. </p>

<p>The world is constantly changing. It seems as if the rules to build a successful life have changed over night, but I submit that they have not changed. </p>

<p>Here are some actionable rules that I have endeavored to follow and found useful in my day to day life:</p>

<ol>
<li>get others to pay for your education or training</li>
<li>get others to pay for your assets and housing</li>
<li>be an owner of something, not just an employee</li>
<li>supply a demand; create value in everything you do</li>
<li>use tactics, business/employees or machines to magnify the value you offer</li>
<li>make more than you spend</li>
</ol>

<p>If we break this down into some examples of how an individual might apply these rules:</p>

<ol>
<li>take only jobs that supply training, or take education for which you can get scholarships</li>
<li>if you want a car, take a job that supplies a car. if you want housing, rent a house, split it into rooms, and sub rent each room, while you live in the basement for free</li>
<li>it has never been easier to start a small side hustle or online business</li>
</ol>

<p>and so on. Find ways to specialize in order to make money, but also find ways to diversify and make multiple income streams. </p>

<p>This advise is not so much on escaping the matrix, which I&#39;m not sure is truly possible, as it is to use the matrix to live your life in a way that is important to you personally. I do not believe that employing other people is slavery; nor is buying rental property and renting it out; but if you believe that these sorts of things are somehow morally wrong, then perhaps you prefer to be a contractor instead of an employee. Then, start a business that uses primarily machines: a company which sells things through vending machines, perhaps, or a laundromat or automated car wash, or write software or books to create something of value which can be sold over and over again; if you must hire people, hire them as contractors (free men who are masters of their own destiny) and not employees, and so on. Use the matrix, to remove the matrix from your own life and free yourself, because a slave is not qualified to free anyone. There are compromises that must be made; the details are what makes life interesting.</p>

<p>Onwards,</p>

<p>Unless you want a diploma to prove to someone that you went to school, or you want to get particularly deep into a specialization, you don&#39;t necessarily need to pay large amounts of money to get access to most of the things you need to know to be successful. Sometimes it&#39;s useful to pay for access to certain things, but you don&#39;t have to go for the full degree.</p>

That&#39;s just the way it is. Americans wanna get up, drink coffee, go to work, sit in traffic, come home to a meal and the kids and repeat the next day. As long as food is on the table, roof over their heads, kids are doing okay they are all set in the world. That&#39;s the problem here. Most people just don&#39;t care.

But it&#39;s a system to put you in debt so you are forced to work, it&#39;s scary and sickening that&#39;s how it is. Nowadays a degree doesn&#39;t even guarantee you a job at all. It&#39;s pretty messed up, I&#39;ve talked to people who went through law school and have over 100k in debt and can&#39;t get a job that even pays 60k a year, that&#39;s a horrible position to be in, it&#39;s all ass backwards. You are definitely on the right path mentally but you need to decide what type of life you want to live.  Don&#39;t blame others for getting sucked into a lifestyle or path because they can&#39;t see the big picture, we are mentally conditioned to follow a certain way. </p>

<p>You don&#39;t need to do that. Save your money instead of wasting it on dumb material consumption. If you save and invest you can retire in 10 years. Read <a href="https://www.mrmoneymustache.com/">https://www.mrmoneymustache.com/</a>, he retired at age 30</p>

I don&#39;t think I could have done it knowing what I know now. But right now, I am investing in property/gold/stocks etc. and spending as little as possible. I have one property that is in beautiful country basically in the middle of nowhere and I plan on more or less retiring when I&#39;m ready.</p>

<p>But its so hard to be a wage slave, and it sucks to pay mortgages, income and property tax, making me a debt slave. Its tough to deal with, but I think the key is to consume as little as possible and do what you have to do to set yourself up in the future to be independent.</p>

<p>I went to college and a year woke the F up to it being a scam and how much debt I would be in, got out of there, got into the trades where you are actually paid while you&#39;re learning (Welding), and then busted my ass for 3 years on a job where I grinded super long hours 7/12&#39;s, then quit, bought an investment property all cash that brings in rental income, had a family member manage it that I could trust while I took off for a year to India, Tibet, Japan, Europe (Poland, Germany, Norway) lived as a monk in a few monasteries for a few months, a Yoga Ashram in India, and had some Ayahuasca  sessions in Chile.</p>

<p>After that, I was &quot;good&quot; and no longer needed to see, to travel, to seek. There were permanent spiritual changes and now all is well. Now, the simplest thing like going for walk, happens while in Oneness and is fascinating. And I do seasonal work, I&#39;ll work for 6-8 months on, and then take 6-4 months off and travel, or rent a cabin, or etc.</p>

<p>Next up for me, purchasing a property to live off the grid, solar, deep cycle, stream turbines, hunting, gardening, etc. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>yeah sure. Also for context though, I bought just as the 2008 recession and real estate collapse was starting to clear up. This was like 2012-13 when the market was starting to get better but you could still find killer deals.</p>

<p>The whole landscape since then has changed. What I would recommend at the very least, is a duplex/2-flat at the very least, so you can stay in one, rent the other, and if you get one with a garage, you can DIY yourself a 1 bedroom apt above the garage as your paychecks come in little by little, so eventually you can move in there while having the duplex rented out</p>

<p>Money doesn’t buy happiness.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>To a certain extend, it does, trust me.
Money doesn&#39;t create happiness from the void, but it will rub out 95% of the problems in your life, making you way clean to reach your goals, and happiness with them.</p>

<p>Honestly, the best thing you could do to get &quot;rid of the system&quot; is becoming multimillionaire... aka having an amount of money that generates enough money by itself to not be concerned by your everyday needs anymore and be able to focus on what really matters to you.</p>

<p>I obviously don&#39;t have the source under hand but I&#39;m backed up with scientific data.</p>

<p>It actually have been studied several times that perceived hapiness is greater the greater your income are, up to the point where all your <em>basic</em> (not always so basic in our countries nowadays) needs are fullfilled. It&#39;s around 3 or 4k for us. After that, it starts to plateau really really quickly, meaning more money than that doesn&#39;t help with hapiness anymore.</p>

<p>So yeah, money doesn&#39;t buy hapiness if you want, but it buys at least serenity.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The first and and most important escape is the inner one. Once you can &quot;escape&quot; the matrix internally, the external escape will follow - your actions will become inspired by the internal freedom, peace and wisdom you have gained.</p>

<p>And the inner escape is fundamentally not even an escape. It is discovering of the inherent freedom, peace, love and deep wisdom that is beyond all the mental fog that you yourself and society at large have imposed on you. It is discovering so much more than that as well, including an intuition that is natural to you and can guide you through life, your deepest nature beyond the body/mind machination....etc. </p>

<p>Meditate, introspect, be present and look within, embrace the thoughts, emotions, sensations that come up, let them go. </p>

<p>It may sound simple, and it is, but it is not always easy. Simply because it may take quite the desire for freedom and the discipline to remain engaged in such introspection and inner integration.</p>

<p>You can escape the matrix in many ways, but the fundamental escape for me is and always will be of a spiritual nature (and do not mistake spirituality with religion, they may have their similarities at times, but most of religion is hopelessly corrupt and the teachings of its founders, like Jesus or the Buddha, have become distorted beyond belief throughout the millennia since their passing).</p>

<p>Simply my perspective of course. </p>

<p>Ultimately you should not believe a word I say, but instead try it for yourself if you are curious about this path.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think you&#39;re both correct. Revolution isn&#39;t the anwer as whatever regime change occurs would trigger a power vacuum that will further enable the current traitors in power to enter a state of complete totalitarian domination. But the atrocities committed by the TPTB are so unfathomably heinous that to simply accept it as the state of the world is defeat; it&#39;s also a vast over-simplification. Without rapid improvement, there will come a time when the conditions of born-free humans are so despicably awful that the less insufferable, and more principled, option is [violent] revolution and war in the streets of the First World. The PTB are working much faster than most people realize, and much more diligently. </p>

<p>What I, and many other people, want is a non-violent restoration of the Constitution and the restablishment and upholding of the Bill of Rights for <em>all</em> citizens. And if violent revolution ever were to break out in the US, however unfortunate that would be, I would certainly hope that it would be for restoration of the Constitution of this great Republic.</p>

He said that because the return is one of the worst things you can invest in.

    <div class="md"><p>Arrogant ignorance is your own worst enemy. Yes it is all fucked. Take solace that there is some order to the chaos and that the global cabal in charge of world building know that old timey ideas, grandfathered laws, and broken systems dont work. Just realise that it takes time to enact change and that regolutions as they happened in late 1800s and early 1900s around the world cannot happen again. So the wars that were around that culled the population, that old population of humans who were not raised in the modern industrialised world. </p>

<p>Adult humans are hard to change, scinece is there. But with our modern world we are chaning all this and hopefully enough of the population is smart enough now to vote for the right ideals in majoroty of the powerful nations. Agenda 21, recently descovered that my ideas on whats hapoening around the world are actuallly a part of this huge document from early 2000s. Seriously, its wierd knowing im not just going crazy. </p>

<p>Take a breath and educate yourself. Take time to learn meditation, self control, your passions and hobbies in life.  The whole system is moving away from current financial debt enslavement anyway, it doesnt work, we know this, so many people dont have retirenment funds if we as societies around the wolrd dont change there will be an uprising against the 1%. And they know this. They are trying hard to change gun laws in america, because this is going to be huge shift in whats going to happen. World is so big, and has so many different governing ways, financial systems, social systems some work some dont, its all an experiment. World has been running experiments on humanity since industrialisation in 1900s. Because it is this automation of technology that allowed us to do things we never could before in history of humanity. Last 100 years have seen most progress than humanity has ever seen in the 100000 some years as modern human species been around. </p>

<p>The next revolution is here people, automation, globalisation of some sort is coming. Just not the one hollywood has been selling us. Its going to happen, because automated world is more efficient and stresmlines just as industriliased world was compaired to the fudal europian factory guilds. </p>

<p>But right now we still have very diverse population numbers. Progressives, liberals, labour, conservatives are all political terms, but in laimen terms it just means thise who want things to remain as they were and those who are ready to imbrace change. Because lets face it, we are humans, independant autonomous, we do what we want, and we are not supporting of the system we are in we will rebel in some way, causing a destruction of society. Ancient world is full of fallen empires and collapsed civilisations. We have learnt from history enough to know that to keep moving forward as a species we need change, and change is needed when systems no longer work for the majoroty. </p>

<p>Current capitalised western world that dominates modern living has come to an end. Many will fight it conservation of their old system and ideals. But change will happen regardless, as majoroty of the world, even US the most anti socialist vocalists, are having socialists movements and socialists running for gov positions. Its hapoening. Things will change just as they did 100years ago for our industrial revolution. So will things change for the automated world revolution thats coming within our lifetimes. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m assuming that you&#39;re talking mostly about how to survive and make money in a predominantly money driven society.  Each country has it&#39;s own challenges; however, after living in several different countries, I have found that some places are easier to live and make ends meet than others.  Taxation makes life harder than it needs to be.</p>

<p>That said, shadow economies exist all over the world.  Most of them are legal and don&#39;t hurt other people.  Find yourself a business that deals mostly in cash.  You&#39;ll be thankful you did.</p>

<p>I&#39;ll just leave a couple of examples to think about: </p>

<ul>
<li>Plant nursery - the IRS doesn&#39;t know how many plants die off, or how many can be grown from other plants.  It&#39;s mostly a cash business.  It&#39;s a business that&#39;s hard to track and cash is still pretty anonymous (as long as you don&#39;t use banks - another discussion)</li>
<li>Fish (i.e. Koi farm) - same reasons as above.</li>
<li>Restaurants (not recommended) - depending on the style of restaurant, can be heavily cash driven.  Many downsides to the restaurant business, high overhead costs, high labor costs, high food costs.</li>
</ul>

<p>People are greedy. But that’s rather cynical to just end there. People are selfish and so are you and me. </p>

<p>I had a lot of the same thoughts at one point. Pretty self destructive and self loathing. Didn’t seem like it at the time. Take on challenges that you can change. Your career, relationships, education... it took me a couple years to figure out. </p>

<p>You’re definitely not wrong that bullshit is going on. Keep investigating and be more positive, it’s helpful and kind of necessary. But things really aren’t as deep and complex as their made out to be. It’s honestly in plain sight and I can give examples for each point I made. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m fixin&#39; to walk/pedal out of here.  Staying in this society means contributing to the misery of others.  Every dollar re-inforces the system.  My lack of hunting skills is the only thing that&#39;s kept me from walking into the Oregon wilds.  </p>

<p>After my last job, I was like, &quot;Why am I doing this only to have enough for food and shelter? If I&#39;m going to just <strong>exist</strong> instead of live, screw it, there&#39;s simpler ways to do that.&quot;  In reality, its not the money one needs, its the resources.  So, I&#39;ve got my bicycle, camping gear/tools and a map of BLM land.  I&#39;ve got xp with cold weather camping, long bike trips, hikes and being uncomfortable.  But I&#39;ve almost always bought &amp; packed in food.</p>

<p>Now, I love my 1/2-3/4lb triple bacon cheeseburgers, but I&#39;ve also become wayyy to aware of how terribly cruel our meat production is.  Typing this, I&#39;ve gone all Pavlov&#39;s dog thinking about walking down to the diner, BUT its also impossible to ignore what goes into getting that burger to me.  It seems killing locally would just be better for everyone all the way around.  So last week I started learning how to set snares for small game.</p>

<p>My savings run out in ~6-8 weeks.  Unless some really awesome opportunity drops in my lap, being a &quot;productive member of society&quot; isn&#39;t really worth it.  Why not give the hunter/gatherer/cyclist lifestyle a shot?  Seems a heckuvalot more honest.</p>

<p>Won&#39;t often be comfortable but...  What we&#39;re doing isn&#39;t right but we&#39;ve gotten inured to it.  How many are reading this on an Apple product?  The tech <strong>IS</strong> pretty cool, but how many factory girls in China are ready to jump off a building because of the working conditions making that tech?  My country lied itself into a war <del>for oil that&#39;s killed over 1mil Iraquis</del> FOR FREEDUMMMM.  There&#39;s example after example after example of stuff that&#39;s done &quot;for a stable, prosperous society&quot; that I&#39;m not really cool with.  Every bit of commerce seems to contribute to stuff most of us would not let happen if it was right in front of us.  And even the stuff that is right in front of us... I&#39;ve been management and had to make dickhead decisions for the company.</p>

<p>Screw. This.  I dunno if it&#39;ll work, but I&#39;m ready to at least try trading society&#39;s &quot;stability&quot; for a clearer conscience.  Does anyone here really feel free?  How many constraints does everyone have on their time that aren&#39;t of any benefit to you or those you care about? I&#39;ll put up with mosquitoes for actual freedom.  Or something more free than whatever &quot;this&quot; is.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Focus on something that gives you purpose and recognize that there is nothing we can do to avoid the suffering and unfairness that is inherent to being human.     </p>

<p>Alleviate suffering where you realistically can. Buy some cheap tupperware, get a slow cooker for less than 50 bucks, make something hot and tasty, throw it in a backpack, and spend a Saturday handing it out to homeless people. Maybe throw in some toiletries and some clean socks. Deodorant and moist wipes are great during the summer. A cheap but warm jacket, pair of gloves, and hat are great in the winter.  </p>

<p>Donate your time to something meaningful. Join a Big Brother-esque program. Give someone less fortunate the chance to learn from someone who has it better y pure chance. Instill this attitude into them. If it takes hold, maybe they can attain something higher than they realized is possible, pass it along to others, and continue a ripple effect that begun with you.   </p>

<p>Learn a practical hobby. Something like woodworking, carving, sewing, knitting, cooking, etc. Something that gives you a creative outlet, and if you&#39;re good enough, a way to monetize your skill.   </p>

<p>Find a topic and commit yourself to becoming as much of an expert as you can on it. Let it completely take over your thoughts during the day. Be the person who impresses people by speaking candidly during a discussion over lunch in addition to the one who people can&#39;t stand drinking with because they&#39;ll start talking about how Y-person influenced X-topic more than people seem to realize.  </p>

<p>Getting through this life is hard, but it&#39;s easier for us than any single person who has lived before us. It doesn&#39;t require ignoring the shit that comes with it, but it&#39;s unnecessarily more difficult to when you allow yourself to hone in on the negatives. Acknowledging is reasonable. Dwelling on things you can&#39;t change is not. It is toxic.  </p>

<p>I have a job that most would consider soul-crushing. It&#39;s your typical cube excel file bullshit. It&#39;s not what I would call fun.  I get to code a bit which I enjoy, but it&#39;s typically to automate the boring shit.</p>

<p>But I enjoy the Hell out of it. I do good at everything I do, or at the very least, am proud of the effort I put in. I enjoy knowing that I&#39;m seen as someone who is valuable to the overall goal of bringing success to the company. I enjoy knowing that I can get better at what I do and move up the ladder. On bad days I take note of what was bad, think about whether or not there was a way to avoid it, and keep it in mind for the day I start my own company. I take note of industry-specific issues: What software would make this easier for everyone? What policies would make people happier to work while not sacrificing productivity? Etc. etc.   </p>

<p>Lastly, realize that working on yourself is the most productive thing you can possibly do in this life. Anyone can be an expert at picking apart others. It&#39;s incredibly easy to start, quick to master, and addictive to continue. Put that ability into yourself and then do something about it. Out of shape? Start moving. Run, join a gym, do body weight exercises, do *something*. Are you not as socially adept as you&#39;d like to be? *Practice*. Make yourself uncomfortable. Go places that you&#39;ll never have to  return to and literally practice being social. When your gut is telling you to not do something that doesn&#39;t immediately put you at risk for serious harm or death, you should do it. Make yourself better and be an example that those feeling the way you do at this moment can look to as an example of how to make the best of it in the future.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m really glad that you found something worth saving in all of that. I really appreciate you letting me know.  </p>

<p>For what it&#39;s worth, I went from a do-nothing potential-wasting pizza delivery driver who couldn&#39;t do as much as a full load of laundry over the course of a week. &quot;Do&quot; really meant &quot;getting them out of the dryer and dumping them on my bed.&quot;  </p>

<p>After a lot of self reflection and intentionally paying attention to my behavior and the way I reacted to things I managed to slowly pull myself out of whatever circle I was stuck in. I still have a Hell of a ways to go, and while life is capable of sending me down even deeper than I was, I&#39;ll be god damned if I won&#39;t give it everything to keep climbing.  </p>

<p>I&#39;m sorry if this seems shilly as Hell but Jordan Peterson was instrumental for me in regard to adjusting my attitude and striving for something worth living for. When I say there&#39;s not a single person who has impacted and improved my adult life more than he has, I mean it. He&#39;s far from obscure at this point, but I <em>highly</em> recommend his lectures and books.  </p>

<p>I sincerely hope that you continue keeping your focus upward. I&#39;ll be going to bed in a few minutes, but shoot me a PM if you ever need to chat.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I recommend the following all of which keep me amazingly free of the matrix:
GET &amp; STAY HEALTHY - critical.
GET OUT OF DEBT - TOP PRIORITY
CANCEL CREDIT CARD
USE CASH for everything possible. Pay in cash, ask to be paid in cash. 
NO CELL PHONE
NO TV
NO ALEXA CREEPY SPY THINGERS in your home
NO Facebook
APPLIANCES - only have appliances that are not connected to the internet. Keep them working and don&#39;t swap them out for a &quot;smart&quot; appliance!
FORGET COLLEGE. Instead
LEARN SKILLS / APPRENTICE Pick something that fascinates you &amp; is vital for human survival. I learned to make real bread, created a business I could run out of my home and lived off of that until I retired
BE YOUR OWN BOSS 
HOME SCHOOL YOUR KIDS - to avoid the cultural engineering, indoctrination and so they are clear about what gender they are.
EARN AS LITTLE MONEY AS YOU CAN GET AWAY WITH to avoid taxes
BE FRUGAL / stop mindless spending so you don&#39;t have to be a wage slave
GROW YOUR OWN FOOD! This more than anything = FREEDOM
IF POSSIBLE, NO CAR. That&#39;s a tough one if you, like me live in a very small rural town. But I&#39;m working out an arrangement to share a car with other households. Having to get a driver&#39;s license, purchase insurance, purchase a car, register it and have it inspected really REALLY keeps you tethered to the matrix.</p>

If you truly believed that people were loving, that you would succeed,  that the government had people within who really cared for others.  Well, perhaps then youd be living in the universe that has Coca~Cola, and eat Kit-Kats, the universe where Queen would end the song with &quot;we are the champions,  of the world&quot;.  Or the universe where Moonraker made sense - where the girl Dolly had tooth braces and ended up falling in love with Jaws - in this universe she doesn&#39;t have teeth braces,  so the plot has no meaning,  there is no reason for her to fall for jaws...</p>

<p>There are infinite universes and existence between them is fluid.  Every time you blink you swap universes.  Welcome to this one,  I dont know why I&#39;m here either,  but like you i see nothing but tyranny.... It&#39;s my fault im here,  i know that.

    <div class="md"><p>Work for yourself. Find what it is you want to contribute and work on it like your life depends on it. If it&#39;s something you have a passion for and truly put effort into, you&#39;ll be successful. You&#39;ll end up surrounded by people who share your passion. Then you&#39;ll start to see that the beauty in life is being able to create whatever you want. It&#39;s hard work to dig yourself out of the mentality the world thrusts upon you but it&#39;s like any other bad habit. You might need a change of scenery. When I woke up, I stopped breaking my back and put all my egg in the music basket. I moved across the country and now I&#39;m planning on moving to an island with by band where we can get a job as a house band for a tourist resort. I might not be rich but ill be living it up on a beach and playing music for the rest of my days and I&#39;m only 31. Make sure to pay it forward. You can do that just by being what it is you think you should be if the world wasn&#39;t holding you back. Because the truth is, it&#39;s not the world holding us back but it&#39;s us holding the world back. The more people that realize this, the sooner we&#39;ll break free as a whole. </p>

<p>You can&#39;t make a difference on the global scale unless you become a politician or a Supreme Court justice or something. But you can make a difference locally.

    <div class="md"><p>My answer is intuition. Believe that you are able accomplish whatever it is you&#39;re still alive for. The moment you give up, they win. In the same way you haven&#39;t noticed the ever so slight flow of air emanating from your nostrils while you read this, the same is true for the war drums beating fervently within your beating heart (the heart of a human being!). You don&#39;t have to be a slave. You can do this. </p>

<p>Listening to intuition is a skill. Takes time to develop. At first mine just said go to therapy (I used to think I was too tough for it, fuck that, therapy is awesome). Then it said quit your job, travel! so I visited various off grid communities and met a fuck ton of people who are also woke to creating a world of peace, working there fucking asses off every day. That experince gave me a vision, and since then I&#39;ve been closer than ever with my intuition and my life just keeps getting better and better. I used to fantasize about killing myself, looking at every stranger like they were a reptile, laughing at my own insanity, a destitute nihilist who bowed to the Babylonian overlords. I&#39;m nothing like that person anymore. </p>

<p>Don&#39;t waste time chasing bottomless rabbit holes. Don&#39;t let people tell you the TRUTH. A lot of people will run their mouth telling you every secret of the universe they know, but it won&#39;t be worth shit if you don&#39;t experience it for yourself. </p>

<p>Most importantly, don&#39;t waste your time. Your intuition is speaking to you right now, in this very moment. You know what it is you need to get done, even if its something suoer small. Open those doors, find out what waits for you further in time. </p>

<p>&quot;Compound interest is the most powerful force in the universe&quot; - Einstein. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You can go off grid if you want to.  A lot of people have.</p>

<p>But there is a price for that.  The price is all the benefits you get from living in a modern technological society.  The mysterious &#39;powers that be&#39; have been doing everything possible to make this an unpleasant option starting with creating many generations of really stupid people who have no idea how to get food, clothing, shelter, or entertain themselves outside of purchasing those things from those who produce them.</p>

<p>If you find yourself being one of these people you have a lot of retraining and reconditioning of yourself to do.  I&#39;m in the same boat.  I couldn&#39;t start a fire, make a reasonable shelter, hunt, fish, or cultivate a crop.  So I&#39;m locked into getting what I need from a modern, western, technological society.  there are rules I have to follow to remain able to do this.  there are people making the rules that I find pretty morally repulsive but you know what?</p>

<p>I don&#39;t have a whole lot of other options.  so I do my thing and try to make the best of it.  If you choose to go the tough route and get out I wish you every success.  If not, then make your choice and don&#39;t worry about shit you can&#39;t do anything about.  you can be woke without being angry and depressed all the time.</p>

Resistance should not be for a “greater good” or “to change the world”. If a critical mass of people choose to live in conscience, then the external reality would change, and that’s to be welcomed.

<p>1Co 15:1  Moreover, brethren, I declare unto you the gospel which I preached unto you, which also ye have received, and wherein ye stand; </p>

<p>1Co 15:2  By which also ye are saved, if ye keep in memory what I preached unto you, unless ye have believed in vain. </p>

<p>1Co 15:3  For I delivered unto you first of all that which I also received, how that Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures; </p>

<p>1Co 15:4  And that he was buried, and that he rose again the third day according to the scriptures: </p>

<p>This gets you out of here:</p>

<p>1Th 4:13  But I would not have you to be ignorant, brethren, concerning them which are asleep, that ye sorrow not, even as others which have no hope. </p>

<p>1Th 4:14  For if we believe that Jesus died and rose again, even so them also which sleep in Jesus will God bring with him. </p>

<p>1Th 4:15  For this we say unto you by the word of the Lord, that we which are alive and remain unto the coming of the Lord shall not prevent them which are asleep. </p>

<p>1Th 4:16  For the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout, with the voice of the archangel, and with the trump of God: and the dead in Christ shall rise first: </p>

<p>1Th 4:17  Then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds, to meet the Lord in the air: and so shall we ever be with the Lord. </p>
