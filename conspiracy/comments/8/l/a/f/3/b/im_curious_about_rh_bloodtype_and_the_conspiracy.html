<p>What if the Rh factor was introduced many millennia ago by a technologically superior, either terrestrial or extraterrestrial, race of people in order to create a human work force that was easily replaceable and controllable? That&#39;s kind of my working hypothesis.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Actually some of the answer on here are correct but RH- blood types evolved to block out others genes. This was probably due to rape. Like one poster said a RH- mother will kill the baby of a RH+ father in the womb.  You will notice almost all RH- blood types are white people, think about that for a second. Ps this isn’t a pro white post before you get mad and I will explain the concept behind it.  White genes are weaker so evolution solved the problem by limiting the amount of RH+ children a RH- mother could have to maybe one in the past. Science can now give the RH- mother shots so she doesn’t kill the baby in the womb while pregnant. From an evolutionary stand point this isn’t a good thing because it acted like a wall and allowed white people to remain white because it allowed the women to have more children if she picked from with own her race.  That would be a good way of making sure the white race survives in a world of stronger genes in the past. In most causes RH- would be considered a sub Species </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Nature doesn&#39;t care if a race survives. Nature doesn&#39;t actually care about anything. Additionally, during the relevant time period for this evolution, who were white people in danger of being interbred by? At that time travel was a sloooooow process and people were pretty isolated. Being Rh- didn&#39;t pose a risk at the time <em>because</em> of that. White populations were so white that any man a woman was in close enough proximity to breed with was also Rh-, therefore conflicting blood types would not be impeding a  pregnancy. </p>
