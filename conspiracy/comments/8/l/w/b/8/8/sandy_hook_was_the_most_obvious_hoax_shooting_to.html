        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>The school had no internet activity since 2008. Hundreds of students who supposedly evacuated the school were nowhere to be found in any of the photos, we only see the same 15 or so children walking in a line unperturbed except for one girl who looks like she just found out that Santa Claus isn&#39;t real. Mold growing all over the school, water damage in the halls from flooding, no wheelchair ramps so not ADA compliant. Fake crying from Gene Rosen, who had several different stories as to what he encountered that day. Robbie Parker laughing/smiling before approaching the podium, followed by hyperventilating and getting into character before he mourns the death of Emily Parker, his 6 year old daughter who died the day before. Donation pages online before the event occurred. Sandy Hook parents visiting the White House before the event occurred. Thousands of houses in Newtown, CT paid off on Christmas Day three years prior. The FBI admitting on there own website that zero deaths occurred by way of manslaughter in Newtown, CT that year. This is all just the tip of the iceberg as anyone who has really dug into this knows. Watch <a href="https://153news.net/watch_video.php?v=KB6MU3HS9WAK">Dear Wolfgang Revisiting Sandy Hook</a>, <a href="http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x56fnjy">Sandy Hook Line and Sinker</a>, and <a href="https://153news.net/watch_video.php?v=K8N4RW23K4HR">We Need To Talk About Sandy Hook</a>. Given the recent news of the lawsuit against the controlled opposition Zio-shill cointelpro agent Alex Jones regarding Sandy Hook (which I believe to be a government psyop in itself) there has been an influx of people, either paid trolls or perhaps useful idiots, shilling for the official narrative given to them by the mainstream mockingbird CIA whore media. Don&#39;t let anyone try to gaslight you into feeling bad about exposing this most obvious false flag hoax. Anyone with half a brain can figure it out if they simply watch the documentaries on it. Be warned that anyone who is challenged to do so will likely respond with something like &quot;lol your proof is a youtube video, that doesn&#39;t count!&quot; I&#39;m sad to say that I have lost friendships over this event and I think we should all be pissed that the government is causing such strain in people&#39;s lives with their friends and family by conducting these sorts of fake shootings in order to chisel away at our rights. And yes, I realize no huge change happened in regards to gun laws after Sandy Hook- they are chiseling away at it though. They can&#39;t just do it all at once, but they&#39;ll point to all these events and say, &quot;see what&#39;s happened now? First Sandy Hook, then the Boston Bombing, now this?? Enough is enough!&quot; I personally really got into researching conspiracies when Pizzagate broke, but when I learned about Sandy Hook and saw just how obvious it was from every conceivable angle, it makes me feel as though this may be the best way we have to expose the truth about how corrupt the US government is to the sleeping masses. It is so much more cut and dry than any other conspiracy I&#39;ve come across, Pizzagate and 9/11 included.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah that’s true, but for example with 9/11 some people (like me) think there were no planes, some think it was a drone or uninterruptible autopilot, some think direct energy weapons were used, some think it was explosives set up by Israeli art students... basically within the pool of people who reject the official story, there is still not as much of a unified consensus as to what actually took place as there is with Sandy Hook truthers.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think that there aren’t as many videos of the planes hitting the towers as you think there are. Do you have any idea how hard it would be for anyone let alone someone who’s not a professional pilot to steer a plane off its flight path and hit a plane? Multiply the incredible/ness of that by 2. And then divide it by 3 because 3 towers fell. No sign of plane wreckage anywhere to be found so I guess when the plane hit it just disappeared into thin air. The thing is that from what I’ve read even if planes really did collide into the towers at the speed they were going, they still would not be able to penetrate the steel structure of the building. So where was any part of the planes after it had hit? </p>

<p>I&#39;ve read that the planes hitting the buildings and the resulting aftermath (what <em>should</em> have been the aftermath as in the plane being destroyed) would be the same aftermath as the buildings hitting the planes ...</p>

<p>What I mean is picture holding one of the buildings like a baseball bat and swatting the plane as it flew by with the building going 600 miles an hour during the swing</p>

<p>It would destroy the plane and have little damage to the building</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I’m open minded either way but as I remembered it, I saw video of people filming the from their apartments... after the first plane hit, people were watching the smoke from the tower, then the second plane hit.  Not filmed by news channel.  Also tons of angles of plane hitting as I remember, at least of the second plane.  How do you explain CGI from that many sources or from amateur video?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Look, I’m as much of a conspiracy nut as the rest of you guys but I live about a half hour from Sandy Hook and can confirm that the school 1000 percent exists. My best friend in high school went there, and I’ve met several of her friends that have younger siblings who attended the school at the time of the shooting. No, I obviously never met the younger siblings, but still. The school definitely exists. </p>

<p>And I’ve also seen the abandoned Fairfield medical facility, as most teenagers in my area have, because it’s supposedly “haunted”. These places are two completely different things ffs </p>

So I’m not just a conspiracy denier without even reading into them. I have looked into this one briefly and there is some weird things going on with it however I don’t think it was fake. People were killed that day as I said earlier, someone I know suffers depression, anxiety, and severe ptsd as they witnessed it. They have told me graphic stories about the incident that you can’t just make up. Have you every thought maybe instead of this being fake, it might have been a staged shooting where the elites were all in on it? I’m not trying to argue with you nor am I butthurt or anything, I’m just trying to have a discussion. Would like to read what you have to say. </p>
