        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I don’t know if this is the place to post this but I will anyway. So this is just a theory, but for the past year I haven’t been able to open reddit without seeing at least one negative post about Donald Trump mostly on r/politics or r/worldnews with a disproportionate amount of upvotes. </p>

<p>I’ve been looking at the accounts posting these and almost all of them have only been posting anti trump posts and comments all with a surprisingly large number of upvotes.</p>

<p>I have experience working on large scale influencing campaigns and what’s been going on on reddit the past year has all of the signs a very elaborate one.</p>

<p>I don’t want to single out any specific party that would be interested in such a large scale influencing campaign against Trump as there are many, but in my opinion it is blatantly obvious that there is one going on and that the whole Reddit community is falling for it and playing into the hands of the people who are running the campaign.</p>

<p>Thoughts?</p>

<p>The analysis may have a bias, but the aggregation of numbers does not. Plus, Nate Silver fully discloses his methodology so you can review that if you please.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Post Rasmussen, they seem to be most accurate. Also, they were the most accurate with 2016 election. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Rasmussen has him at 49% and is included in the aggregate. Anyone who knows anything about polling knows that aggregates tend to be more accurate overall than any individual poll.</p>

<p>About 50% Chomsky/Sanders/Occupy types and  50% Ron Paul libertarians/Ancaps.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This sub is also influenced by those same people, and more than one of the comments you&#39;ve already received is from them.<br/>
The only thing I will add is that it&#39;s mostly bots these days, not real people, and they&#39;re mostly <a href="http://washingtonsblog.com/2014/07/eglin-air-force-base-busted-gaming-reddit.html">military/intelligence</a>.<br/>
Killary was the deep state&#39;s next planned puppet. She was supposed to win via electronic voting machine manipulation, which she did - the machines gave Killary the majory of the votes - <strong>but</strong> the software didn&#39;t properly take the electoral college into account so Drumpf ended up winning.<br/>
The deep state (CIA &amp; friends) went into panic mode and have been trying to rally the public against him for impeachment pressure.<br/>
They want Drumpf either impeached or cooperative because of fear of impeachment. At this point they&#39;ve pretty much got him under control but not quite. They gotta keep that public pressure on him so he&#39;ll keep dropping the bombs and progressing the police state expansion.</p>
