<p>Why is it you do not believe a overwhelming majority of scientists when it comes to climate change. Roughly 95% of scientists say it is a real thing and a threat to the planet (let alone the living organisms on the planet). I think of it like you seeing 100 doctors and 95 of them telling you that you have cancer, but you choosing to believe the 5 that said you don&#39;t. </p>

<p>I&#39;m not here to convince you that climate change is real (I do believe in it), but I want to know why you do not. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>WDNL doesn&#39;t believe in empirical evidence it appears as demonstrated by his reactions when people point out errors in his reasoning.  For example the link he provides you below is sometimes sold as coming from a scientific journal when it doesn&#39;t.  Please see <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/briankoberlein/2018/04/06/the-tale-of-a-1986-experiment-that-proved-einstein-wrong/">https://www.forbes.com/sites/briankoberlein/2018/04/06/the-tale-of-a-1986-experiment-that-proved-einstein-wrong/</a></p>

<p><em>It turns out it isn&#39;t an article. It&#39;s a one column letter to the editor by one E. W. Silvertooth claiming he did an experiment with details to follow. No evidence, no link, no peer review, just an unsubstantiated claim. Still, supporters of a fixed Earth model cite this article a great deal, refering to it as the Silvertooth experiment. What they don&#39;t tend to do is cite any actual experiment.</em></p>

<p><em>If Silvertooth was right, the wavelength variations should follow sidereal time, not solar time. Marett found there was so much noise in the data, the variation in wavelengths could be made to agree with either sidereal or solar time. Digging into things more closely, he saw a correlation between the observed wavelength shift and small fluctuations in the temperature of the room. The change in temperature was shifting the alignment of the experiment laser, causing the apparent shift Silvertooth saw. Marett also found that the calculated motion of the Earth only worked because Silvertooth assumed the data measured an actual wavelength shift. Silvertooth&#39;s results were real, but his conclusions were wrong.</em></p>

    <div class="md"><p>Climategate? Well.. climate change is completely natural. In fact, we are still coming out of a mini ice age. As climate fluctuates so does the environment we live in such as rising oceans, desertification, different storm patterns. The problem is that there are billions of humans living on this planet now that rely on an balanced supply and demand as well as on reliable sources obtained from their immediate environment such as water and agriculture. Slight deviations from reliable supplies can have huge ramifications.</p>

If it&#39;s a top down system, with higher-ups shuffling and determining when and where lower-downs get to progress, then a small cadre of corrupt people just reward the opinions they want, and freeze out the inconvenient lower-downs.</p>

<p>If it&#39;s a cloud system, then yeah, a few bad apples wouldn&#39;t invalidate the system.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Don&#39;t let yourself get so angry. Do you always throw tantrums like this? I&#39;ve already explained to you how climate change is natural and how it impacts humanity. Maybe you passed that up because it doesn&#39;t fit your narrative I don&#39;t know. Not only does climate change happen naturally but we are in fact coming out of a mini ice age that lasted a few hundreds of years. I&#39;m more than happy to answer your questions but I first need to know if you understand what climate change is. I have a hunch that you only see climate change from a political view point and are unaware that our planet&#39;s climate had not always been like it is today. So before I can explain more about climate change to you I would like you to tell me what you believe climate change means in your own words and why you don&#39;t believe in it. Do you believe earth has always had our current climate? Thank you in advance for answering my questions and I promise that once you give me your definition of climate change I will be able to answer your question more thoroughly. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This plus there is no actual definitive answer to what climate change actually means? </p>

<p>Let&#39;s assume that 95% of all scientists agree on climate (A very big claim with no real source plus what defines a scientist? Who did they include in this and more importantly who did they not include?). What <em>exactly</em> do they agree on? I have yet to see a definite answer to this? </p>

<p>Furthermore what does it mean to &quot;deny&quot; climate change?</p>

<p>What I see happening is there are these massive vague overarching terms like &quot;climate change&quot; being used two describe two different things. </p>

<p>On the one hand in these studies demonstrating scientists support it means that they agree that the climate is changing which is something extremely vague that most scientists obviously agree on. </p>

<p>Then on the other hand when someone questions a specific prediction or study that claims that in a short period of time some negative outcome will happen and someone questions that prediction (i.e. ocean levels will receed by x in 15 years causing massive death) it suddenly refers to that specific prediction anyone who denies that specific prediction is suddenly accused of denying &quot;climate change&quot; or the entire overarching idea of it. </p>

<p>Not only does this lead to a lack of real studies out of fear of scientists and politicians losing there credibility through this kind of political slander for even daring to question &quot;established&quot; science, but more importantly it creates a fear in the average person mind over the future as many of these predictions (with extremely low confidence bounds fyi) are negative.</p>

<p><em>In March 2012, we searched the ISI Web of Science for papers published from 1991–2011 using topic searches for &#39;global warming&#39; or &#39;global climate change&#39;. Article type was restricted to &#39;article&#39;, excluding books, discussions, proceedings papers and other document types. The search was updated in May 2012 with papers added to the Web of Science up to that date.</em></p>

<p>So it includes authors published in scientific journals who mentioned climate change terms.</p>

<p>There are lots of these studies, and most of them come up with a number around 97-98% of all scientists that mention these terms state that global climate change is exacerbated by human activities (AGW, or anthropogenic global warming).  Studies that do not claim a position on AGW are not included.</p>

<p>Not trying to be a dick or challenge you, just trying to answer some of your questions!</p>

<p>Your proving my point. See how vaguely climate change is defined here. If I were to say that I don&#39;t think that the there will be any problems for the next 300 years is that &quot;denying&quot; climate change? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>They aren&#39;t defining climate change at all in this paper.  They are only searching for articles that use the terms &quot;climate change&quot; or &quot;global warming,&quot; and then seeing if the authors concluded that mankind influences climate change or not.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know, but that doesn&#39;t have anything to do with the paper I linked for you.</p>

<p>I was just trying to show you where that quote about 97% of scientists agreeing on climate change being anthropogenic comes from so you don&#39;t have to question it anymore.</p>

<p>Again, not trying to be confrontational here, just answering your question from your initial post.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have always focused on how climate change is used to increase governmental control over our lives. Thats my beef with the whole climate change issue, its an excuse to restrict the freedom of the individual. All of a sudden the governments are &quot;doing the right thing in regards to climate change&quot; and all of the things they are doing lead to further and further restrictions of the individual (not the company, I believe that companies are NOT individuals and do NOT have the same rights as individual). </p>

<p>Personally I think climate change is occuring because we have grown overly materialistic and pay zero attention to the spirit world inherent in the earth and we literally rape and pillage it with impunity. There are other beings living here (the elementals) and our disbelief in them is causing them to lose their willingness to co-operate with humanity. I don&#39;t think they mind if we dig a uranium mine or burn fossil fuels but the manner in which we do it (for comfort and entertainment and without any thankfulness or respect) is the biggest problem.</p>

<p>I think if we performed our &quot;harvesting&quot; of the earth&#39;s goodies with some reverance and respect instead of the mad dash for the filthy luchre performed by multi-national companies who gives zero fucks about anything but money, then we would be in better shape. Sounds crazy as fuck I know but this is not some new age concept that requires you to become flaky. It is a spiritual scientific observation made by many. See the Findhorn garden (in the UK) and also the book Nature Spirits and What They Say.</p>
