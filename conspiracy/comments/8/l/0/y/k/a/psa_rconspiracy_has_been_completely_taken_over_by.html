    <div class="md"><p>There&#39;s too many things to list that cast doubt on the entire thing.</p>

<p>First and foremost, the russia investigation serves to distract from the fact that the DNC was exposed.  They were bought by Hillary, and of course Bernie never stood a chance.  </p>

<p>The intel reports : Who hacked who?  Was anybody hacked?  Who knows, because they&#39;ve proven nothing.  </p>

<p>The other intel report : RT ran stories about fracking, and hosted 3rd party candidates as an effort to undermine the US.  Yes, this is actually in one of the intel reports.  Huge red flag.  Both of these items are false, and in no way are proof of some grand russian conspiracy.  </p>

<p>The fact that those items are used in an intel report to support claims of an alleged russian plot means only one thing, they have nothing.  It&#39;s made up.  It&#39;s bullshit.  </p>

<p>Crowdstrike?  lol?  Conflict of interest much? </p>

<p>McCabe.  LOL, nice pension.  Hope it was worth it.</p>

<p>Comey.  LOL, congratulations on the book deal.  </p>

<p>There is evidence of collusion with Israel.  We just saw the embassy open which led to dozens of people being killed, and will likely be invoked in future terror attacks.  </p>

<p>Kushner directed Flynn to contact russians to sway their votes in favor of Israel.  Actual retards took this evidence to be evidence of collusion with russia, because... they&#39;re retarded and can&#39;t grasp the israel connection or refuse to do so.  </p>

<p>TLDR : Russiagate is bullshit.  Nothing is proven.  Nothing will be proven.  </p>

<p>You know that Trump admitted to Lester Holt in a televised interview that he fired Comey because of the Russia investigation. This is a recorded fact. You can watch the clips. It happened. If the Russia investigation was based on BS why would he do that. </p>

<p>We have evidence that 2 separate meetings happened at Trump tower with powerful foreign nationals who were trying to collude. One of those meetings involved a person representing the interests of the Russian Federation.</p>

<p>It is widely established that Wikileaks is deep in bed with Russia. Wikileaks also leaked Clinton&#39;s emails. The day of the Russia-Trump Tower meeting is the same exact day Trump began tweeting about the Clinton Emails that needed to be released. </p>

<p>Flynn &amp; Sessions each lied numerous times about meetings/calls with Sergei Kislayak, the former Ambassador to the US, which is a Logan Act Violation given these meetings happened before Trump was President. </p>

<p>All of this is established fact. The Senate intelligence committee has officially come out and said that it is there belief and backed up by fact that the Russian  worked to influence the US election in Trump&#39;s favor.</p>

<p>So do tell where are you sources that:</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Source? None of that rings a bit true and sounds like desperate deflection. Wikileaks and by proxy the Russian Federation already had the emails so what would Fusion GPS use as bait? This point is utter bs. Also we know thanks to Don Jr. releasing his own emails/correspondences regarding the meeting that Bob Goldstone, who was acting on the behalf of Emin Agalarov, setup the meeting up and that Don Jr. was chomping at the bit for it, remember &quot;If it is what you say it is I love it&quot;. Also don&#39;t forget that the Agalarov family are quite familiar with the Trumps and have had numerous interactions with them. Explain that?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Flynn, lol another scapegoat. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>False. Flynn was fired by Obama so he had no legal right to any of those interactions as he was a private citizen and in no way acting on behalf of the US government. Also don&#39;t forget about Flynn&#39;s involvement with a plot with Turkish nationals to kidnap the cleric Gullen in Pennsylvania. Also don&#39;t forget that it&#39;s also reported and confirmed that Flynn tried to establish his own secret communication channel while in the Pentagon breaking. Also don&#39;t forget that Flynn has been a known quantity for Russia, having sat with Vladimir Putin during a Russian State dinner for some awards thing. Pictures are there that prove it. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Flynn pretty much got set up. Consider first that they never proved russia did anything, and obama rushed through a new round of sanctions before leaving office. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Considering that the US Senate intelligence Committee announced that Russia absolutely actively worked to influence the election in Trump&#39;s favor directly refutes that claim. Cleary Russia did things that the Republican led Senate acknowledged as serious actions. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>It was Flynn&#39;s job to have those discussions he&#39;d ultimately have as a result of Obama.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Dun matta, Flynn should have waited then until Donald Trump had been inaugurated. Being too eager is not a valid excuse for committing crimes and breaking the law. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>So, once again, there&#39;s nothing there until Obama and friends create the conditions for something to happen. It&#39;s all bullshit.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>False. We have multiple independent and government sanctioned reports that verify that Russia absolutely worked to influence the election in Trump&#39;s favor. Between confirmation by the intelligence community, former Obama administration cabinet members, Obama Administration NSC members, former CIA directors, current Trump appointed Secretary of State/former Trump appointed Director of the CIA Mike Pompeo, Trump appointed Ambassador to the UN Nikki Haley, former Trump appointed Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, current Republican majority held Congress Senate Intelligence Committee, former FBI Director James Comey, former deputy FBI Director McCabe, current Trump appointed FBI Director Christopher Wray. </p>

<p>The only people denying or disputing Russia&#39;s involvement in the election and actions to help the Trump Campaign are the Republican majority House or Representatives House intelligence committee led by Trump Transition Team member Devin Nunes (who himself is suspected of committing numerous ethical and potentially legal violations by blocking an open investigation and colluding with the Trump White house), Trump and Trump family and Co. (which doesn&#39;t mean much given that they are the suspects and have mountains of evidence against them), Members of the Freedom Caucus, some who were involved with the Trump Campaign and Transition Team including Gaetz, Jordan, among many others who have also been obstructing transparency of spread of findings and information. </p>

<p>Other than that there are no people in the government or federal agencies/organs that officially dispute Russia&#39;s role in election interference in Trump&#39;s favor. </p>

<blockquote>

<p>I&#39;ve seen it and I&#39;m missing no context. consider that it was clear enough that it gave enough merit to the Russia investigation that it was the instigating event that led to Robert Mueller the Third&#39;s hiring as Special Counsel and his mandate. Also don&#39;t forget that Trump is a proven liar who lies about everything from making phone calls to military widows, inauguration crowd sizes, inauguration day weather, lies about phone calls in general, lies about policy, lies about business ties, etc. </p>

<p>But, please explain to me what context i&#39;m missing from that exchange in the video. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s quite the dissertation you&#39;ve written up.  But simply saying false after something I posted doesn&#39;t mean anything if it&#39;s not false.</p>

<p>My point about Flynn for example.  It was going to be his job to talk to those people.  Obama&#39;s rushed sanctions based on little to no evidence forced the topic of sanctions and made it inevitable for him to have such a discussion.  </p>

<p>I don&#39;t think you grasp the simple concept I&#39;m laying out which applies to many other cases.  You see, there was no russia collusion.  So, people talked to people.  And it wasn&#39;t until accusations, false accusations started coming out that those conversations suddenly were looked at as malicious. </p>

<p>&quot;please explain what context I&#39;m missing&quot;</p>

<p>Let&#39;s see.  &quot;I was going to fire comey.  There&#39;s no good time... I said to myself, you know... this russia thing is a made up story, it&#39;s false, it&#39;s an excuse by the democrats...&quot;</p>

<p>So, the context you&#39;re missing is that the whole thing is false to begin with.  Trump knows this.  Everybody who knows anything knows this.  </p>

<p>He then goes on to say in the next sentences that he wants the thing fully investigated.  </p>

<p>You are probably the victim of the fakestream media assault on Trump that spun his words here and made it seem like there was wrong doing.  You&#39;re not alone, many other people have fallen in to this same trap.</p>

<p>Good luck getting better informed on the facts and finding some reason and sense in your life.</p>

<p>Hun, I don&#39;t you get it. Even if there was no collusion between Trump &amp; Russia (there was), Flynn was not legally allowed to contact Kislayak and talk about sanctions until Trump was sworn in and Flynn was working in an official role. Collusion or not, the mere action of discussing official business while being a private citizen is a no no. So you&#39;re still wrong. </p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Source that conclusively proves that this whole Russia collusion is &quot;false&quot;? considering that the intelligence community believes there was attempts at collusion speaks against this. </p>

<p>More importantly you&#39;re ignoring the fact that a day or 2 after that interview Trump had a meeting with Sergei Kislayak &amp; Sergei Larov in the Oval office where he was quoted saying he wanted to get rid of Comey because Comey was pressing forward with the Russia investigation.</p>

<p>Flynn likes coke.  it&#39;s delicious.  Obama likes pepsi, and just before leaving office he puts sanctions on coke based on hastily put together reports by people with a history of lying, and many conflicts of interest.   Flynn loves his coke though, so he calls them and says... i&#39;m still going to drink coke damnit!</p>

<p>And then for papadopolous you could say that he too likes coke, because it&#39;s delicous.   One day the FBI pays him a visit.  They strong arm him, and intimidate him and make him believe that his love for coke is illegal and he&#39;s going to do hard time for it.  He&#39;s cornered.... he tells them he likes pepsi and not coke.  They arrest him for lying to them. </p>

<p>Re : trump meeting with russians.  Again, this is only unusual in the context of creating an environment in which any contact with russia is taboo.  What you have to do is first prove wrong doing.  Until then, it&#39;s just conspiracy theories.</p>

<p>C&#39;mon bud, you gotta provide some sources. This is all baseless deflecting. Which of the US intelligence agencies has a history of lying and many conflicts of interest? What about MI6 or the Dutch both of whom provided information? Why do you think the FBI is against Trump, because thats exactly what you&#39;re saying here. </p>

<p>you either don&#39;t understand the law or your purposely being obtuse. What Flynn did was illegal plain and simple. He was trying to conduct official state business as a private citizen. Thats the problem. Even if he called the Ambassador from Tonga to discuss any official matters before Trump was inaugurated and Flynn officially confirmed as NSA (national security advisor) it would still be illegal. It&#39;s only worse for Flynn because not only did he lie about contacting Russia, but he contacted a country that has been confirmed by the US Senate intelligence committee, State dept., DOJ, DOD, all the American Intelligence agencies, Dutch intelligence, Mi6, both the former and current FBI directors, the 2 former CIA directors to have meddled in the US election. </p>

<p>Flynn didn&#39;t get in trouble for putting his hand in the cookie jar that the government said was off limits. Flynn got in trouble for putting his hand in the cookie jar that was actively attacking the US election, and then lied about it after getting caught. Dun matta what cookie jar he dipped his hand into. Going into any cookie jar when he did was already illegal. </p>

<p>Your analysis of Papadoplous is wildly inaccurate and useless. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Re : trump meeting with russians. Again, this is only unusual in the context of creating an environment in which any contact with russia is taboo. What you have to do is first prove wrong doing. Until then, it&#39;s just conspiracy theories.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You&#39;re still wrong! A campaign meeting with envoys from a foreign goverment to discuss official matters is still a no no, especially when discussing removing sanctions in response for election help. Connect the dots.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>As someone who&#39;s lurked on this sub years before even joiningg reddit, I think it&#39;s pretty clear what has happened with this sub and why R/TheDonald doesn&#39;t like it  </p>

<p><strong>?-Jul2016</strong>: 9/11, JFK, Rothschild, Bush family, and the good conspiracies <em>backed by evidence</em> were most of the content.<br/>
<strong>Jul2016-Apr2017</strong>: Hillary&#39;s Wikileaks emails is the conspiracy this sub was suspected, so lots of <em>real evidence</em> that links her to the ultra-elite.  We get our first flood of R/TheDonald users<br/>
<strong>Apr2017-Mar2018</strong> Sub is flooded with any and all conspiracies as to why Trump never colluded with Russia <em>that aren&#39;t backed by facts</em>.  We get floods of R/TheDonald users and Russian bots for this reason<br/>
<strong>Apri2018-now</strong> Now that <em>the facts</em> are making it pretty clear Trump never drained the swamp and over a dozen of &#39;his people&#39; have been proven to have colluded with Russia, this sub is starting to look at Trump (deservedly so) the same way we looked at Hillary.  r/TheDonald doesn&#39;t like that  </p>

<p><strong>TLDR</strong> r/TheDonald thought this sub was anti-left around the Hillary emails, then found out we were against corrupt elitists like Trump.   </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think you missed a step. Around the time of the election (early November) there was an additional wave of stories about Hillary Clinton that had no basis in fact (like she was dying of some cannibal disease, other various conspiracies not worth mentioning). </p>

<p>You&#39;re totally correct. All the evidence points to Trump being the most corrupt president any of us have ever seen, and that his campaign (though not Trump directly, at this point) definitely colluded with Russia. So now it&#39;s swinging back in that direction.</p>

<li><p>Users flooded here in huge numbers (many of them came from here in the first place).  </p></li>

<p>Here&#39;s the main point: you can&#39;t &quot;invite&quot; people who are already here. The &quot;invitation&quot; was posted here, not there, and therefore the people who saw it were already here. There was nothing wrong with that post. There&#39;s something badly wrong with the people who are still bitching about it so many months later. It is one of the purest examples of gaslighting I have ever seen.</p>

<p>there&#39;s been an israeli counterintelligence company on reddit for at least the past 6 years, and they were on Digg prior.  You can google their handles and see them documented as &quot;shills&quot; going back almost a decade on web forums. They&#39;ve actively brigaded this sub for a long time and use it to push the idea that those who criticize neoliberal and neocon policies are stupid bigots.  they use memes to drive identity politics and have done so since &quot;enough-paul-spam&quot;.</p>

<p>they did the same thing when they founded the donald sub.  they used it to control the populist message and coopt the conspiracy theorist/ libertarian concepts that they&#39;ve been fighting for years.</p>

<p>Can you link specifically what there traps were, I must have missed them?  Also keep in mind Trump &#39;being set up&#39; still requires him taking the bait, which it seems like 20+ of his closest buddies did   </p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Again, let&#39;s pretend all 20+ indictments were based on &#39;traps&#39; that the Trump campaign still fell for.  I mean I can pile up some cocaine outside an addiction facility or email someone a link for free illegal download of music, but that other party still is breaking the law by their own free will regardless of my &#39;trap&#39;   </p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>And conspiracy forums generally have shown that the CIA/FBI generally supports the bankers, zionists, and oil tycoons.  Problem with your theory on &#39;the entire intelligence community working against Trump&#39; theory is that it doesn&#39;t make sense because Trump is supporting those very same people. Why would &#39;an entire intelligence community&#39; fight against an ally, and what proof do you have of it being &#39;the entire&#39; intelligence community?    </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Okay, so you&#39;re the DNC and you&#39;ve decided to go full Nixon and use the government for your party&#39;s benefit. Goal 1 is get Clinton elected, obviously. So you... get the FBI to announce publicly that Hillary Clinton&#39;s under investigation for her emails, despite the fact that their unofficial motto is &quot;we don&#39;t comment on ongoing investigations&quot;? Then you have Comey&#39;s conclusion be that Hillary shouldn&#39;t be indicted, but should be shamed by the FBI director on national television for being very very naughty? Then you have Comey send a letter to Congress <em>days before the election</em> saying &quot;OMG NEW EMAILS, INVESTIGATION REOPENED!!!!11!!1one&quot; then follow it up the day <em>before</em> the election with &quot;oops, sorry, nothing to see here after all&quot;?</p>

<p>Well, Goal 1 was a huge failure. Luckily, the DNC is prepared for this with Goal 2: set Russian traps and make Trump seem like he&#39;s in bed with the Russians. Get those undercover agents in there, get those illegal spy warrants somehow, have a Russian lawyer pretend to have dirt on Hillary, all that stuff. Of course, no one would be so stupid to actually fall for that last one, but it&#39;s worth a try, right? Obviously any respectable campaign, upon reading &quot;This is obviously very high level and sensitive information but is part of Russia and its government’s support for Mr. Trump,&quot; would report it --</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If it’s what you say I love it especially later in the summer.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Oh. Fuck. Wow, Trump Jr. took the bait. And it&#39;s June 2016! Plenty of time to get that info out there and throw the election! We&#39;ll send in that lawyer with some juicy but not particularly damaging dirt on Hillary. We can have the FBI go public with its fake Russia investigation, and we&#39;ve got Trump Jr himself eager to collude! Drop that shit right after the Access Hollywood tape&#39;s starting to fade from the news cycle and bam, President Hilldawg!</p>

<p>Oh, wait, what&#39;s that? We didn&#39;t hear about the &quot;fake&quot; Russia investigation until after the election? We didn&#39;t hear about the &quot;fake&quot; Trump Tower meeting until after the election? Fuck. I knew the DNC was incompetent, but I didn&#39;t think they&#39;d go to all the effort to secretly set up the opposing campaign and then <em>not actually release the damn dirt until they had already lost</em>. </p>

</blockquote>

<p>Is Trump banging the war drums or is the media banging the war drums? Afaik Trump has much less blood on his hands than Clinton and it&#39;s important to remember that <em>people</em> are still heavily involved in elections throughout the country and it would be nearly impossible to cheat the entire election. Sure, you could be selective/smart about your cheating and probably get away with it but the entire country? I don&#39;t think that would be possible.</p>

<p>Ask yourself this... if MSM (aka propaganda outlets) are as complicit with our corrupt government as many of us think they are and Trump was truly trying to drain the swamp do you think they would be doing anything other than trying to hurt Trump&#39;s polls as some sort of hailmary play to impeach him and save their own corrupt asses?</p>

<p>And if the swamp was as deep as we all think, did anyone honestly just expect to arrest them all day 1 and execute them? Sure, I dreamed about it but that&#39;s not realistic. It takes time to build a solid case and to find out about <em>all</em> who were involved... and we&#39;re talking about the biggest web of corruption this country has ever seen.</p>

<p>Or this could all be scripted as a way of giving some of us a little bit of hope. I guess we&#39;ll see what happens with NK/Syria etc and whether or not Trump will get as much blood on his hands as Clinton did.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>They tricked JFK into the Bay of Pigs and then killed him when he said he would scatter the CIA into the wind. Trump&#39;s entire campaign was about draining the swamp / deep state... aka the same thing JFK <em>said</em>. Maybe they can&#39;t get to Trump with the current tech guarding the president, but they can certainly coordinate MSM attacks and possibly impeach him.</p>

<p>At the very least, Russiagate is bullshit. Just look at Strzok texts, Comey, Bruce Ohr &amp; his wife, McCabe &amp; his wife, and ZERO evidence Russia gave WikiLeaks the emails... which is what started the entire Russiagate story. Obama could have released the proof, but there was no proof.</p>

<p>Russiagate is happening because Democrats &amp; MSM is desperate, or because larger forces are at work and this is all part of the script. I hope it&#39;s the former but who knows.</p>

<p>Reddit cant have what happened in the 2016 election happen again. This sub, TD, Wikileaks, and pizzagate was a huge push in getting the truth out about Wikileaks, The DNC and Clinton corruption. Reddit has contained these fringe subs, quarantined TD and basically every conservative and truth sub. The rest, they just let TopMinds vote brigade and control.</p>

<p>Its coordinated. This sub flipped like politics. It went from praising Assange,  to talking about how Assange was a Russian plant. It went from calling out WashintonPost, CIA fake news media to filling the sub with WP articles. Anyone who doesn&#39;t fit the leftist narrative is downvoted or banned. Rule 10!</p>

<p>Everyone sees it. The leftist socialist shills deny it. Reddit is a corporate owned leftist circlejerk like Twitter. The lefts narrative cant exist with censorship, manipulated and controlled discussion. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Isn&#39;t that kind of defeatist though?  </p>

<p>Most of us are not anarchist or anti-government. However, many of us are here because we saw that our governments have been corrupted and stopped working for the common interest long ago. I would love to be pro-government, but that would require a massive political upheaval to get the system moving in a positive direction.  </p>

<p>Now the contentious part: Many supporters of the current president believe that he <em>is</em> that massive political upheaval. He&#39;s certainly stirring the pot and some of it does seems to be bearing fruit (Korea). Many of his supporters believe he is the first president in at least several decades to legitimately challenge the presidential puppet masters. He has publicly hinted at belief in a number of conspiracy theories before he became president, so it&#39;s not impossible to imagine that he took steps to protect himself and his family before entering office. What could a president accomplish if the puppet strings of the global cartel were finally cut? What if that is actually his main goal? What if the all the seemingly avoidable controversy is tactical cover?  </p>

<p>Now, you might disagree that anything in the preceding paragraph is happening. Go right ahead, it&#39;s not even my point. My question is where do we draw the line and how do we decide? Hypothetically, if change were really, finally coming, when would it become &quot;acceptable&quot; for conspiracy communities to endorse the movement?   </p>

<p>I understand wanting to stay reserved for the sake of remaining skeptical, but this community seems to have jumped the shark in the exact opposite direction. This community has become entirely intolerant of <em>any</em> consideration that there might be more than meets the eye to the current president. On the one hand, we are told that good conspiracy theorists would never support any politicians. Then those same people turn around and slip in partisan DNC talking points or casually mention that Hillary would have been better while riding an upvote train to the sky with a bunch of weirdly copacetic friends. You can&#39;t blame me for wondering if there is something inorganic about that.  </p>

<p>Let me end by bringing a famous example into context: Ron Paul. If you were around on Digg or Reddit in 2008, then you remember the phenomenon. It was an interesting little movement. Many people in <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> were supportive, although pretty much everyone agreed that he didn&#39;t stand a chance. My question is the following: would we be so intolerant to Ron Paul supporters if, by some unlikely sequence of events, he had managed to win in 2008 or 2012? Would we have entire threads devoted to chastising his supporters for falling for the false left/right paradigm again? He ran as a Republican, after all. Would we have threads defending the Federal Reserve every 3 days because the new president is against it? Would drug prohibition suddenly be the correct position for conspiracy theorists to take if the president was suddenly anti-prohibition?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t think this sub is that important, it isn&#39;t particularly huge or influential. Most people wouldn&#39;t notice, those who would be made suspicious are most likely already conspiracy theorists.</p>

<p>Not to mention the fact that there are so many wildly different theories here that there&#39;d be no way of knowing which theories, if any, were close to the mark. You&#39;d have people arguing it was because we were onto the Deep State, others would say it&#39;s because we figured out Hillary Clinton eats babies, others would claim that the Jewish cabal decided to crack down on us, or was it because we discovered the world is a simulation created by alien energy beings who have tasked their shapeshifting slave race of Reptoids to farm us for the negative energy they need to survive or was it because...</p>

<p>I&#39;m sure banning it would stifle conspiratorial discussions the same way banning hate subs stifled hate speech.</p>

<p>I didn&#39;t think so, either. I didn&#39;t think r/politics was that important, and I used to enjoy discussing all sorts of things with relatively open minded people there. Then it got taken over by CTR and ShareBlue shills. It was incredibly obvious. </p>

<p>And guess what? The same exact thing happened here, around the time that Pizzagate and Spirit Cooking broke. Clearly, something struck a nerve because this place got inundated with shills. I don&#39;t know what else to tell you, but apparently there is enough traffic here that they saw it as a threat.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Honestly, I disagree with the idea that those subs have been overrun with shills. There were probably CTR shills and Russian bots on r/politics during the election though. To me, &quot;shills&quot; just seems to mean &quot;people I disagree with&quot; on this sub.</p>

<p>It doesn&#39;t raise any red flags in my mind that when this sub moved from more traditional anti-government conspiracies to outlandish conspiracies like pizzagate, more people started to disagree with the narrative.</p>

<p>It&#39;s the same as how threads about flat Earth or Reptoids are generally downvoted while threads about corruption or chemtrails are generally upvoted.</p>

When you think openly, or try to at least see 2 sides, you can usually wade through the BS. And because the amount of BS that is building up in Trump&#39;s admin, already, it is hard for people on this sub to not call it out. </p>

<p>Are you taking a position that being a conspiracy theorist and being anti-Trump are mutually exclusive? Because that&#39;s what it sounds like. And that&#39;s a real stretch. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ok. Sorry. In that regard, yes, I&#39;d have to agree. However, I do think there are deep state elements that, rightly or wrongly, are trying to expel Trump like a bad virus which does interest the conspiracy theorist in me as I expect they had everything set to have HRC as president. If they came out definitively that the Russians hacked the election then everyone would expect a fight and it would delegitimize the Presidency. They can&#39;t really admit that one way or the other without looking like idiots for letting it happen or asking for a war. The only safe course is to say they helped Trump get dirt on HRC and spewed a bunch of fake news. And that is a convenient excuse to institute more Big Brother measures. </p>
