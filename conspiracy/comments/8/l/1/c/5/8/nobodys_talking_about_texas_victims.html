Nothing from the living victims, because they&#39;re all pro-gun and pro-arming teachers. We&#39;ve already established that the media is BS, but this is ridiculous. A news anchor tried to bait a kid into blaming guns, and the kid didnt take it. Guess which kid never got spoke to again. Its sick that mental health is treated as a non-issue. This only further proves to me that somebody wants a weaker society. I&#39;m not saying the shootings are fake, but they&#39;re definitely being exploited. And again, nobody talks about mental health, even though it&#39;s the one common factor in all of these violent attacks, regardless of the weapon used. It all reeks of a hidden agenda, and its damn sick. </p>

<p>Again, guns aren&#39;t the issue. They aren&#39;t an issue until you get to the illegally / wrongfully obtained ones, which will be there either way. When people are scared to get help because of how abusive and how incredibly shitty our &quot;care&quot; system is for the mentally ill, theres an issue. When it&#39;s the norm to demonize mental illness and belittle folks afflicted with them, theres an issue. When more dangerously mentally ill people are on the streets and in prisons than in actual facilities, there&#39;s a fucking issue. </p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>One of the key points of activists is mandatory psych evaluations.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The problem with this is that psychiatric treatment, may, (note I said MAY) be part of the problem. And expecting psychiatric workers to look in to that aspect openly and honestly is not very realistic.</p>

<p>Guns have been around forever in the US and in fact are more restricted now than they wore at times before these shootings. So what is new that could be causing the issue? I would think giving powerful psychiatric drugs and stimulants to teenage or younger children is one issue that needs closely examined. So psych evaluations are going to cause more, not less of this.</p>
