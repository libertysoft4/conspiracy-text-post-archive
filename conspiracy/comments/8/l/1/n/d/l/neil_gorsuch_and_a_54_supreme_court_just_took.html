        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>The beneficiary of the deciding Supreme Court seat that was held open for nearly a year in an unprecedented delay of &quot;advice and consent&quot; just cast the deciding vote and wrote the decision.</p>

<p>NEIL GORSUCH says that the 1925 Federal Arbitration Act (FAA) passed by a Republican government before the Great Depression overrides the 1935 National Labor Relations Act (NLRA) and its provision for employees to join together for &quot;mutual aid.&quot;</p>

<p>This means that employers can write provisions into contracts that require employees who have claims of illegal wage withholding into can be denied their right to courts. They have to go to private arbitration/</p>

<p>And it gets worse.</p>

<p>Employees may also be blocked from joining together in arbitration. If an employer rips off a hundred employees a small amount of money, those people are no longer allowed to join together for an overall decision on similar wage claims. They must each go separately, pay their separate fee, perhaps hire their separate lawyer, etc.</p>

<p>IT&#39;S EVERY WORKER FOR HIMSELF!</p>

<p>Ironically, the case was decided by joining together three employers to reach an overall decision on the claims of different employers.</p>

<p>You read that right. Employers joined together to get a joint decision that employees cannot join together when they are ripped off of wages -- certainly not in courts but now also not even in private arbitration.</p>

<p>5-4 decision. All Republicans voted to cut off employee rights. All Democrats voted to maintain employee rights.</p>

<p>The Sixth Amendment reads:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In Suits at common law, where the value in controversy shall exceed twenty dollars, the right of trial by jury shall be preserved, and no fact tried by a jury, shall be otherwise re-examined in any Court of the United States, than according to the rules of the common law</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But this guarantee of trial by jury is not even considered.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Because they&#39;ve already forced a lot of employees into forced arbitration agreements. If you work at a corporation in NY that is based out of LA you would have to travel across the country on your own dime to meet with an arbitrator who your employer has selected.

    <div class="md"><p>Right. It&#39;s not all bad though. This is a ruling on a statute, not the Constitution. So we can change the statute and override this decision.</p>

<p>For example, Congress could right up a law specifically overturning the Supreme Court like:</p>

<hr/>

<p>In our view, the Supreme Court decided against our intention in passing the FAA. </p>

<p>We hereby overrule the Supreme Court decision in <em>AT&amp;T v. Concepcion</em> where the Court held that the federal government may overrule states rights to contract law even when the company commits unconscionable fraud, and restore state contract law. (See my other comment for background)</p>

<p>We further override the Supreme Court decision in <em>Epic Systems v. Lewis</em> and provide that the National Labor Relations Act applies to all collective actions for mutual aid, regardless of union membership, and such law shall be interpreted to expressly include joint court actions and joint arbitrations.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s not how it works. Congress can&#39;t just &quot;proclaim&quot; that the Supreme Court interpreted a law the wrong way. What they could do is pass another law that makes clear that class action arbitration is allowed, let&#39;s call it the AAA (American Arbitration Act). Then the lower courts would have no choice but to rule that class  action arbitration is legal, SCOTUS would deny review, and there you go.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Congress can say what they want. I threw up that language to give people a quick example. As long as they make it clear, it does the job. Recent examples include the Ledbetter Act and the Religious Freedom Restoration Act (and a later version where they had to do it again).

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks. I just read that article. It is a bit light weight. Here&#39;s more info:</p>

<p>In 2011, a 5-4 Supreme Court used the 1925 FAA to overturn long established state contract law. AT&amp;T had been defrauding cell phone customers. Everyone agreed that their deal was &quot;unconscionable.&quot; The state supreme court using a very old common law rule said that AT&amp;T could not hide behind &quot;unconscionability&quot; and block lawsuits by consumers. In other words, you cannot defraud people deliberately then hide behind a contract that says the person defrauded is not allowed to sue or even to join together in class action.</p>

<p>Then, the Supreme Court stepped in and said yes, you can commit unconscionable fraud and hide behind contract provisions that don&#39;t allow people to sue or even to join together in arbitration.</p>

<p>Today, that ruling has been extended to the employer-employee relationship, and they are using it widely in employment contracts.</p>

<p>In a few days on May 25, companies like Yahoo are adding similiar provisions to their online browsing agreements. Pretty soon, every business of every kind will require those who wish to have any relationship at all to first agree that they have no court rights, and further, to agree that they have no collective rights. </p>

<p>Goodbye to our right to sue.</p>

<p>The Guardian work for you? </p>

<p>Try attacking the substance of the argument rather then the source. It’s a pretty weak stance to take and shows you can’t refute the argument. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t understand the point you are trying to make in this context.  </p>

<p>Are you suggesting the consequences of losing via cheating are different than the consequences of losing while not cheating?  If there had not been cheating and but they still lost would Gorsuch not be on the court?  That makes no sense.  Your post seems unrelated to the context of the conversation you are responding to.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The Court has held that “the Second Amendment extends, prima facie, to all instruments that constitute bearable arms, even those that were not in existence at the time of the founding,” District of Columbia v. Heller, and that this “Second Amendment right is fully applicable to the States,” McDonald v. Chicago. In this case, the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts upheld a Massachusetts law prohibiting the possession of stun guns after examining “whether a stun gun is the type of weapon contemplated by Congress in 1789 as being protected by the Second Amendment.” ...</p>

<p>... the explanation the Massachusetts court offered for upholding the law contradicts this Court’s precedent. Consequently, the petition for a writ of certiorari and the motion for leave to proceed in forma pauperis are granted. The judgment of the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts is vacated, and the case is remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion. It is so ordered.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So because the lefties on the SC voted with the right wingers to not allow Massachusetts to ban stun guns, that somehow means the lefties have accepted <em>Heller</em>?  Stun guns are not firearms.  They are not regulated like firearms, and trying to claim that this is proof that Democrats aren&#39;t gun grabbers is absolute horseshit.  Just because the Democrats don&#39;t want to ban stun guns, or paintball guns, or squirt guns does not mean that they don&#39;t want to ban real guns.  They do.</p>

<p>Stun gun case.  The opinion makes a distinction between stun guns/tazers and firearms.  According to the court, stun guns are considered &quot;arms&quot;, hence <em>Heller</em> applies.  But just because they are &quot;arms&quot; doesn&#39;t mean they are firearms.</p>

<p>Not likely.  She started out liking it, but later after it had changed she said it was not good.

<p>Yes I believe so, or at least one not trying to neuter itself and making decisions that factories can pump their waste into rivers again.</p>

<p>Special interest groups would have continued to attack it, but they wouldn&#39;t have a bought and paid for shill running the FCC so they wouldn&#39;t have made any traction.  Net Neutrality is very popular with a big majority and any bill trying to negate it would have failed.  Even now congress is working towards removing the repeal by Ajit. I suspect that whoever she appointed as head of the FCC would have worked towards making it much more protected if it continued to come under attack.</p>

<p>The 1925 Federal Arbitration Act is silent on employee-employer relations. The law was written in a time of business-to-business contracts.</p>

<p>The 1935 law is newer than the 1925 law. This means that the guarantee of &quot;concerted activities for ... mutual aid or protection&quot; to the extent it conflicts with an earlier law, overrides such law.</p>

<p>It&#39;s 2018. NLRA was passed in 1935. Some 73 years after the law was passed, a slim majority of the Supreme Court discovers a right of employers to defy the Seventh Amendment and deny rights. This is exactly &quot;legislating from the bench.&quot; </p>

<p>That isn&#39;t how legislative interpretation works. </p>

<p>&quot;It is this Court’s duty to interpret Congress’s statutes as a harmonious whole rather than at war with one another.&quot;</p>

<p>The Arbitration Act speaks directly to arbitration, the NLRA doesn&#39;t.</p>

<p>Furthermore, SCOTUS has never read a right to class actions into the NLRA.</p>

<p>You aren&#39;t &quot;denying rights&quot; when you enter into a contract to settle disputes via arbitration.</p>

<p>In the Federal Arbitration Act, Congress has instructed federal
courts to enforce arbitration agreements according to their
terms—including terms providing for individualized proceedings.</p>

<p>It sounds like you don&#39;t like the policy impact of the decision, and that is a fair criticism that can be remedied by Congress. But here, the majority did the proper job of the judiciary and they interpreted the law as written.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>The NLRA doesn&#39;t say anything about class actions.  That&#39;s the whole point.  If you think it should, lobby Congress to add it to the law.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s what Gorsuch says at the start of the opinion of the Court:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Should  employees  and  employers  be  allowed  to  agree  that  any  disputes  between  them  will  be  resolved  through  one-on-one  arbitration?    Or  should  employees  always  be permitted  to  bring  their  claims  in  class  or  collective  actions, no matter what they agreed with their employers? </p>

<p>As  a  matter  of  policy  these  questions  are  surely  debatable.    But  as  a  matter  of  law  the  answer  is  clear.    In  the  Federal  Arbitration  Act,  Congress  has  instructed  federal  courts to enforce arbitration agreements according to their terms including  terms  providing  for  individualized  proceedings.    Nor  can  we  agree  with  the  employees’  suggestion that the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA) offers a 
conflicting  command.    It  is  this  Court’s  duty  to  interpret Congress’s statutes as a harmonious whole rather than at war with one another.  And abiding that duty here leads to an unmistakable  conclusion.   The  NLRA  secures  to  employees rights to organize unions and bargain collectively,but it says nothing about how judges and arbitrators must try  legal  disputes  that  leave  the  workplace  and  enter  the  courtroom or arbitral forum. This Court has never read a right  to  class  actions  into  the  NLRA—and  for  three  quarters of a century neither did the National Labor Relations Board.   Far  from  conflicting,  the  Arbitration  Act  and  the  NLRA have long enjoyed separate spheres of influence and neither  permits  this  Court  to  declare  the  parties’  agreements unlawful.</p>

<p>Not until 2018, 93 years after the FAA and 83 years after the NLRA, did Neil Gorsuch, John Roberts Jr., Anthony Kennedy, Clarence Thomas, and Samuel Alito discover a right of corporations to block employee joint action or arbitration in order to protect those corporations from valid wage claims or any other claims that a group of employees may have against such corporations.

<p>Gorsuch addressed it in the opinion:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>A  close  look  at  the  employees’  best  evidence  of  a  potential  conflict  turns  out  to  reveal  no  conflict  at  all.    The  employees  direct  our  attention  to  the  term  “other  concerted activities for the purpose of . . . other mutual aid or protection.”    This  catchall  term,  they  say,  can  be  read  to include  class  and  collective  legal  actions.    But  the  term  appears  at  the  end  of  a  detailed  list  of  activities  speaking  of  “self-organization,”  “form[ing],  join[ing],  or  assist[ing]  labor  organizations,”  and  “bargain[ing]  collectively.”    29  U.  S.  C.  §157.    And  where,  as  here,  a  more  general  term  follows  more  specific  terms  in  a  list,  the  general  term  is  usually  understood  to  “‘embrace  only  objects  similar  in  nature  to  those  objects  enumerated  by  the  preceding  specific words.’” Circuit City Stores, Inc. v. Adams, 532 U. S. 105,  115  (2001)  (discussing  ejusdem  generis  canon);  National  Assn.  of  Mfrs.  v.  Department  of  Defense,  583  U.  S.  <em>__, _</em>_ (2018) (slip op., at 10).  All of which suggests that the term “other concerted activities” should, like the terms that precede it, serve to protect things employees “just do” for  themselves  in  the  course  of  exercising  their  right  to  free  association  in  the  workplace,  rather  than  “the  highly regulated,  courtroom-bound  ‘activities’  of  class  and  joint litigation.”  Alternative  Entertainment,  858  F.  3d,  at  414–  415 (Sutton, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part)(emphasis  deleted).   None  of  the  preceding  and  more  specific  terms  speaks  to  the  procedures  judges  or  arbitrators must apply in disputes that leave the workplace and enter the courtroom or arbitral forum, and there is no textually sound  reason  to  suppose  the  final  catchall  term  should bear such a radically different object than all its predecessors.</p>

<p>That Court has never read a right of employers to block joint arbitration when employees are wronged -- for three quarters of a century because it didn&#39;t come up.</p>

<p>It seems like it did come up because there are a shit ton of relevant cases mentioned in the opinion.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Contracts with arbitration clauses are bullshit. It&#39;s like adding layers of bullshit on top of each other. What if the other party doesn&#39;t follow the method of arbitration detailed in the contract, do they go to court and have a judge order them to follow the contract&#39;s method of arbitration? Bullshit layered ontop of bullshit.</p>

<p>And they&#39;ll continually add more layers of bullshit until a contract is like a codified book of laws on its own. They&#39;ll do this because they want you to need a lawyer in order to sign any contract with an arbitration clause, as the court won&#39;t be able to help you, if you get screwed.</p>

<p>The correct implementation of a contract is one with simple language and plainly defined terms, which can be read by a layman. If neeeded, the jury of a court of law can decide if a party to the contract was in the wrong.</p>

<p>This whole thing reminds me of the Ferengi in Star Trek, and their Rules of Acquisition. Specifically, there&#39;s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_Parts_(Star_Trek:_Deep_Space_Nine">an episode</a>#Plot) where a Ferengi thinks he&#39;s dying, so he sells ownership of trays of his dessicated remains on the Ferengi exchange market. The buyer is another Ferengi who doesn&#39;t like him. The first Ferengi finds out he&#39;s not really dying, so he tells the second Ferengi that the deal is off. The second Ferengi doesn&#39;t care if he&#39;s not going to die, and refers to Rule of Acquisition No. 17: &quot;A contract is a contract is a contract.&quot; So the first Ferengi has to either kill himself, or get ostracized from the Ferengi community for breaking a contract.</p>

<p>You argument seems to be that because the statute says &quot;other&quot;, it can mean anything, including that employees can break a contract and form a class action.  The court disagreed, and their reasoning for that is in the opinion I linked.  You can disagree with that, but I think they did a pretty good job of explaining it, and if you do disagree I suggest you contact your Representatives and urge them to change the law to include specific protections for workers right to class action or collective arbitration.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Now that the expert has spoken, here is some real information.</p>

<p>In 2011, a 5-4 Supreme Court overturned long established California state contract law and overturned a lower federal court decision finding an AT&amp;T contract unconscionable. SCOTUS protected AT&amp;T from having to deal comprehensively with its &quot;unconscionable&quot; fraud. Therefore, contrary to what the expert said (&quot;unless an arbitration agreement is unconscionable&quot;) it actually is enforceable, but only since 2011 when five Republicans said it was.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>General contract law applies </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Based upon the above, general contract law <em>does not</em> apply -- not even the doctrine of unconscionability. The federal government intruded into state contract law in 2011 and now again in 2018 in ways that could not even be imagined back in 1925 when the Federal Arbitration Act was passed.</p>

<p>Today&#39;s decision ups the ante and says that now employers can take away rights of workers both (1) to sue and (2) to join together in similar claims, just as I said when I submitted this.</p>

<p>(There are earlier decisions that ate into these areas before, all by Republicans, but the bites they took in these two cases are gluttony.)</p>

<p>Sometimes, when courts &quot;find rights&quot; -- for example by applying a 1925 law to a new situation in 2018 that did not exist in 1925 when the rule was made -- by using old words and applying them to new situations, the &quot;constitutionalists&quot; call that &quot;judicial activism.&quot; Not this time because unlike the recent gay marriage case which protected citizens, these two cases protect corporations. That&#39;s the real difference.</p>

<p>I get really tired of partisans trying to drag us in circles over the same material, and I stand by my post exactly as written. :)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>They took away an important portion of the traditional state contract public policy doctrine called &quot;unconscionability.&quot; The word means that someone has committed such serious fraud that it shocks the conscience. Why would they take away any conscience shocking wrongdoing? </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Unconscionability applies after AT&amp;T. AT&amp;T only removed unconscionability</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Sometimes, it still does. The trend is away from permitting courts or even state laws to protect people against conscience-shocking fraud. I happen to oppose conscience-shocking fraud in all cases.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>applies to class action waivers</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The 2011 AT&amp;T case was primarily about taking away the rights of consumers to participate in joint arbitration. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>This [the new case <em>Epic Systems v. Lewis</em>] is just a continuation of what started in AT&amp;T.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So, now you are agreeing that this &quot;started&quot; in 2011, 86 years after the Federal Arbitration Act? Nice.</p>

<p>What you call &quot;continuation&quot; is better explained as <em>expansion</em> -- expansion to take away &#39;states rights&#39; to decide contract law. The federal court is eliminating long standing public policy exceptions -- in other words, taking away protection for things like adhesion contracts, boiler plate language, take-it-or-leave-it contracts, undue influence, fraud, unconscionability, duress, misrepresentation, etc. -- a whole long list of things that violate contract law that we studied in contracts class -- namely the meeting of the minds and bargained-for exchange.</p>

<p>This particular &quot;continuation&quot; expands from business-to-consumer contracts to employer-worker contracts. Since 2011, these types of joint arbitration bans have proliferated the marketplace, making them harder and harder to avoid.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If you voluntarily decide to work for a company, they can frame your employment however they want to.</p>

<p>This apparently is your ideal -- total control by the employer. It is not the reality. But we are heading that way. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re misstating the law for dramatic effect. Yes, it&#39;s true that arbitration law is moving more towards corporate bias. It&#39;s not true that unconscionability has been gutted. In order to use the defense of unconscionability, you must show that the arbitration agreement, standing alone, is unconscionable. <em>Bank of the Ozarks</em>, a case from the Arkansas Supreme Court, allowed the court to look at the whole contract; however, this is not typical. </p>

<p>Arbitration agreements are &quot;separable,&quot; and this has been the law since before the FAA even. All AT&amp;T did further cement separability into the FAA. This is necessary because arbitration takes authority away from the court. If you can bring equitable defenses against entire contracts, without a separable arbitration agreement, then an arbitration agreement is useless. The FAA itself preserves equitable defenses.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>You do understand that state&#39;s have arbitration acts too, right? The FAA is very vague, and it only preempts expressly contrary state law. Supreme Court decisions are not universally binding on all courts always. </p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>All AT&amp;T did further cement separability [sic] into the FAA. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Here&#39;s how the ABA describes it, since you want to appeal to authority:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The centerpiece of the FAA, section 2, provides that an arbitration agreement “shall be valid, irrevocable, and enforceable, save upon such grounds as exist at law or in equity for the revocation of any contract.” 9 U.S.C. § 2. The effect of the last clause, often referred to as the “savings clause,” is that courts may refuse to enforce an arbitration agreement that would be subject to generally applicable state law contract defenses such as fraud, duress, or unconscionability. However, an arbitration agreement may not be invalidated by state law defenses that affect only those agreements; arbitration agreements and other contract terms must not be subjected to discriminatory treatment. AT&amp;T Mobility LLC v. Concepcion, 563 U.S. 333, 339 (2011). </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Note the word &quot;However.&quot; That&#39;s a nice way of saying that the language of the FAA does not match what was decided by a 5-4 Court in the cited case in 2011 -- that the FAA was expanded signficantly.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>state&#39;s [sic] have arbitration acts too, right? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>So what? Some states may decide to have an analogous law to a federal statute. California, the state overruled in the AT&amp;T case, did not. </p>
</div>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re missing the point. In <em>Concepcion</em>, the Supreme Court ruled that state laws which held certain types of arbitration provisions unconscionable were invalid.   The Court held that arbitration agreements must be treated the same as any other contract. The Concepcions entered into a new cell phone contract that included free phones, but they were charged sales tax on the retail value of the free phones. The contract between the Concepcions and AT&amp;T required all disputes to be arbitrated but did not permit class-wide arbitration.   When the Concepcions sued AT&amp;T in federal court, their suit was consolidated with a class action alleging that AT&amp;T had engaged in false advertising and fraud by charging sales tax on free phones.   The district court denied AT&amp;T&#39;s motion to compel arbitration under the Concepcions&#39; contract because California&#39;s Discover Bank rule voided arbitration provisions that disallowed class-wide arbitration.   The Ninth Circuit agreed and held that the FAA, which makes arbitration agreements &quot;valid, irrevocable, and enforceable, save upon such grounds as exist at law or in equity for the revocation of any contract&quot; did not preempt its ruling.  On petition for certiorari, the United States Supreme Court held that &quot;when state law prohibits outright the arbitration of a particular type of claim, the analysis is straightforward: The conflicting rule is displaced by the FAA.&quot;   The Court held that California&#39;s Discover Bank rule,   which barred class action waivers, was preempted by the FAA.   The Court went further, suggesting that &quot;the same argument might apply to a rule classifying as unconscionable arbitration agreements that fail to abide by the Federal Rules of Evidence, or that disallow an ultimate disposition by a jury[.]&quot;   Through Concepcion, the Court abrogated all state laws which rendered specific types of arbitration provisions invalid.   State laws may not treat arbitration agreements differently than other types of contracts.  Though the Court struck down state laws which barred certain types of arbitration provisions, unconscionability as a contract defense to arbitration agreements still exists and can render arbitration clauses invalid on a case-by-case basis.   To raise unconscionability, a plaintiff must challenge the arbitration agreement - and only the arbitration agreement - in court and raise the defense under general state contract law. Concepcion only struck down state laws which treated arbitration agreements differently than other contracts.   Though there is disagreement among commentators, Concepcion did not eliminate the unconscionability defense as to arbitration agreements because unconscionability is still allowed as a defense within Section 2 of the FAA, which allows any defense in contract law or equity to be raised against an arbitration agreement.   Further, federal arbitration law leaves the definition of unconscionability in the hands of the states.  The only effect Concepcion had on plaintiffs was to limit their ability &quot;to take the easy way out&quot;   by claiming that certain provisions were invalid under state law instead of having to prove unconscionability under general contract law. To raise unconscionability after Concepcion, a plaintiff must prove the elements of unconscionability under the laws of the jurisdiction where the action is brought.   The legal community has written extensively about the doctrine of separability, and the next Section will examine some of the commentary on the doctrine.</p>

<p>You can still find arbitration agreements unconscionable under the common law. You cannot have a statute that specifically renders certain kinds as unenforceable. </p>

<p>Chief Justice Roberts and Justice Alito have  also indicated, through their dissents as well as their majority rulings, a will ingness to close the courthouse doors and deny access to justice to ordinary Americans, a judicial ideology that we have seen among many of President Bush’s federal appellate court nominees as well.
6   In fact, the Court’s trend in this area “was so pronounced that Professor Judith Resnik of Yale Law School proposed as a label for the term: ‘the year they closed the courts.’” </p>

<p>The Supreme Court has a history, and everyone knew the other 4 on each side were corporate friendly or common man friendly.

The people who jump in here and spout off that shit they heard over in their echo chamber about &quot;Bye, bye middle class,&quot; like this shit is all on Trump. I should start keeping track of all the times somebody reguritates one of those obnoxious party lines. I don&#39;t know if Trump has done more to help or hurt so far, time will tell, I hope. I&#39;m the meantime, I do know the middle and lower class have been fed on like vampires for a very long time now and while Trump may have had some hand in that as a business man, the politics of the situation came into play long before he was potus. He likely had very little to do with the financial collapse of 2008 and the subsequent bail-outs. The foundation of all that lies with previous administrations both red and blue.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Gorsuch was approved constitutionally. In contrast, there is an argument to be made that requiring a supermajority was unconstitutional.</p>

<p>Having the Supreme Court legislate labor laws would have been unconstitutional (as that is the role of the legislature), and indeed the very notion of federal labor laws as they apply to single-state companies is unconstitutional from a plain reading of the Constitution. As recently as 1915 federal labor laws were deemed even by the Court to be unconstitutional.</p>

<p>So the Court simply kicking it back to Congress this time was comparatively mild.</p>

<p>This entire post is bullshit. All this does is uphold contractual agreements. If you sign a contract stating you waive collective bargaining and group lawsuits and that you agree to private arbitration - then you are bound by that agreement. Which is 100% common fucking sense. </p>

<p>The 1935 law is newer than the 1925 law. This means that the guarantee of &quot;concerted activities for ... mutual aid or protection&quot; to the extent it conflicts with an earlier law, overrides such law.</p>

<p>That isn&#39;t how legislative interpretation works. </p>

<p>&quot;It is this Court’s duty to interpret Congress’s statutes as a harmonious whole rather than at war with one another.&quot;</p>

<p>The Arbitration Act speaks directly to arbitration, the NLRA doesn&#39;t.</p>

<p>Furthermore, SCOTUS has never read a right to class actions into the NLRA.</p>

<p>You aren&#39;t &quot;denying rights&quot; when you enter into a contract to settle disputes via arbitration.</p>

<p>In the Federal Arbitration Act, Congress has instructed federal
courts to enforce arbitration agreements according to their
terms—including terms providing for individualized proceedings.</p>

<p>It sounds like you don&#39;t like the policy impact of the decision, and that is a fair criticism that can be remedied by Congress. But here, the majority did the proper job of the judiciary and they interpreted the law as written.</p>
