<li><p>Under the ‘Kentler Experiment’ of the 1970s, Berlin welfare authorities handed over homeless teenagers to known paedophiles. In most cases they were asked to care for 13 - 15-year-old drug addicts and prostitutes. “It is simply unimaginable that something like this happened with state oversight.” <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/life-and-style/health-family/germany-s-secret-paedophilia-experiment-1.2897942">https://www.irishtimes.com/life-and-style/health-family/germany-s-secret-paedophilia-experiment-1.2897942</a></p></li>

<li><p>Members of a U.N. peacekeeping mission engaged in &quot;transactional sex&quot; with more than 225 Haitian women in exchange for food and medication, a sign that sexual exploitation remains significantly underreported in such missions.

<li><p>A new report commissioned by the Colombian government and FARC rebels has concluded U.S. soldiers and military contractors sexually abused at least 54 children in Colombia between 2003 and 2007. The investigator cites one case where 53 girls in the town of Melgar were targeted by contractors who filmed the abuse and sold the films as pornography. In another case, a 12-year-old girl was allegedly drugged and raped by a U.S. Army sergeant and a contractor. Under immunity agreements, none of the alleged abusers were ever punished. The media group FAIR notes the story has received no coverage in the U.S. corporate media. A number of U.S. outlets have reported on a new Justice Department probe which concludes U.S. drug enforcement agents in Colombia participated in &quot;sex parties&quot; with prostitutes hired by Colombian drug cartels. <a href="http://archive.is/0iSv4">http://archive.is/0iSv4</a> (5th story down on this page)</p></li>

<li><p>The Pedophile Director Embraced by Hollywood-  Filmmaker Victor Salva was convicted of raping a 12-year-old boy. But his new film, ‘Jeepers Creepers 3,’ is now playing in theaters.

<li>Several of the children who Cameron experimented on were sexually abused, in at least one case by several men. One of the children was filmed numerous times performing sexual acts with high-ranking federal government officials, in a scheme set up by Cameron and other MKULTRA researchers, to blackmail the officials to ensure further funding for the experiments. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unethical_human_experimentation_in_the_United_States#Founding">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unethical_human_experimentation_in_the_United_States#Founding</a></li>

    <div class="md"><p>It got a lot of bad attention though. Sure some people didn&#39;t care about it until a democrat and HRC was involved but still it was a lot of bad attention because it&#39;s a weak accusation with no victims and not a single missing children&#39;s report that said &quot;last seen at comet ping pong&quot;.</p>

<p>Because of the political slander, namely the fake food code word list, a lot of people lost credibility. </p>

<p>David Seaman is a good example. I remember 6 months into the &quot;pizzagate&quot; he was saying he has sources that Podesta is going to jail. He&#39;s lost credibility now. </p>

<p>For Ben Swann everything by the man is brilliant except for the pizzagate video. Where he talks about the Besta Pizza logo and just jumps over to Comet Ping Pong randomly. That discrepancy is why he went to anchor and now is slinging dash digital cash now.  </p>

They basically take a topic (like pizzagate) and they essentially create a lot of false media, fake accounts, fake social media posts, etc that all sound fucking insane or just aaaaaaalmost true. This massive disinformation tactic helps to make people sound crazy when bringing up a topic. The term, &quot;conspiracy theroist&quot; used to be a normal field of journalism. Over time the word has been muddied so that you now sound like some tin foil hat aliens guy who is just insane. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think a good takeaway would be the comments sections of the outlet. Alex Jones generally gets pretty positive feedback. People enjoy what he does, know it&#39;s pretty tongue in cheek, and often want to support him more.</p>

<p>Media Matters comment section is a nasty, divisive place. It&#39;s readership appears to have contempt for large chunks of the country, disdain for people who vote differently. Based on the writing from the outlet, it&#39;s pretty easy to understand why.</p>

<p>Most people know Alex Jones is a wacky guy, and listen to him through a certain lens. MMFA, however, is a massively influential organization, in bed with the Clinton machine, and doing it&#39;s best to create a right in the country. I think the founder can take a conspiracy theory, for as much shit as he&#39;s flung at the fan.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don’t think Pizzagate is disinfo, but I appreciate your post. There is a Guns and Butter podcast episode featuring Lori Handrahan who has been researching child trafficking for 30 years which is well worth listening to as well. She doesn’t make any speculations into Pizzagate, all of her research has evidence in the form of official documents from lawsuits and whatnot to back it up and it is shocking to say the least. <a href="https://m.soundcloud.com/guns-and-butter-1/americas-traffic-in-child-pornography-lori-handrahan-381">America’s Traffic in Child Pornography</a>.

<p>If you paid careful attention, you would notice that his assertions rely on a 3rd party anonymous &quot;hacker&quot;. All Titus would have to do in a lawsuit is claim he <em>believed</em> this &quot;hacker&quot;. A defamation lawsuit requires the defendant to <em>knowingly</em> spread a false lie. It&#39;s a form of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plausible_deniability">plausible deniability</a>.</p>

<p>As far as the emails go, you would also notice he skips a lot of emails in his conversations with the detective (after getting combative, from what I could tell). Here&#39;s another email you might find interesting:</p>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/FreeRadioRevolu/status/928755776985948160">https://twitter.com/FreeRadioRevolu/status/928755776985948160</a></p>

<p>Regardless, let&#39;s assume the &quot;hacker&quot; really did find CP. There are hundreds, if not thousands, of sexual abuse support organizations. It&#39;s not like the Metro PD or the FBI are the <em>only</em> groups out there. Certainly, there must be other police departments or the press. Some idealistic tech worker or journalist willing to back up his claims with their reputation. Yet, the &quot;hacker&quot; can&#39;t get a <em>single</em> one to vouch for them. It should be clear that this &quot;hacker&quot; is a hoax.</p>

Have to assume backup was called in. I watched the Titus interview with the actual guy that found it and you might also recall that a burglar (very likely assassin) was arrested on his property. This guy wasn&#39;t a larper - he seemed very sincere and afraid. His real name was attached to the police reports and he now sleeps with a gun... crazy shit. If it was a larp why would he put himself in the crosshairs of the FBI and potentially get put away for CP? If this was anonymous, sure I could buy it, but this dude put himself out there and nothing came of it. The fact that he wasn&#39;t charged with anything is proof that the evidence held water IMO.</p>

Hmm i dont agree with that. Madeline Mcann, The elites known as Podestas have some f*cked up taste in &quot;complicated&quot; art. The brothers likeness was purposfully hidden by the media for 5 years, the p.i. who commisioned it from witnesses was found &quot;suicided&quot;. At the time madeline went missing the Podestas were visiting a known elite peados house, just around the corner!,  incidently the owner/peado of the house invited the Mcanns for dinner days after their daughter went missing. That case also had MI6 sniffing about from the start, Nothing about that seems strange to you? Im sure its all nothing.</p>

<p>What about all the creepy pictures of kids</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Those are called suspicions, not evidence. And many of them were only creepy if you intentionally tried to view them through a lens of creepiness. (Like the one with the toddler&#39;s arms taped to a table - that is a joke about how toddlers are destructive and impossible to control.) I won&#39;t deny that some of them were pretty weird, but weird people are not automatically criminals.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>and all the surrounding businesses with FBI confirmed symbols that pedophiles use? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Not similar enough or unique enough to be distinguishable from complete coincidence. This is almost as dumb as the code words thing, although at least it wasn&#39;t fabricated from whole cloth. But regardless, just because at some point a pedophile used a spiral shape as a code symbol does not mean every spiral shape in the world is an indication of pedophilia.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I believe pizzagate <em>because</em> of all these storys, ive grown up in care hearing storys from numerous care staff of elite/rich/powerfull peado rings so im well aware that it is a very real phenomena, and my ears now prick up on every peado story for years, alot of the real stuff like OP mentioned is buried in the noise of shit known as &quot;pizzagate&quot;, the problem is that even the most credible storys still all have unbelievable aspects because the scale is hard for people to imagine. But in my experience &quot;pizzagate&quot; wouldnt have happened at all if &quot;they&quot; didnt want it to and the &quot;noise&quot; is kind of a marker for somthing being hidden. Was pizzagate the noise to hide pedogate? Maybe as a cover for Maddeline Mcann? It happened around the time the press embargo was lifted on the podestas photofit and the P.I. who commisioned it was killed, it was slotted into the pizzagate scene quite whole, thats my suspicion. The fact is that the foxes are running the hen house, foxes who have their own planes, trucks, connections, houses built with secret rooms etc and access to information that keeps them a step a head, The foxes built the very system that they use for their sick ends and almost always presented in the name of somthing holy or good, a form of camoflauge which also makes it harder to discern what exactly is going on.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think Pizzagate was projection, a distraction, and a way to sow division. </p>

<p>I also think the current administration is ramping <em>up</em> the government&#39;s child sex trafficking operations through the separation of immigrant children from the parents. I think Pizzagate and Q are misdirection. Q is convincing the very people who might catch on to what&#39;s going on, conspiracy theorists, that there&#39;s &quot;nothing to see here, folks, those over there are the <em>real</em> pedos, just ignore this administration&#39;s horrific treatment of immigrant children and setting up of the perfect circumstances for trafficking. Nope, it&#39;s <em>all</em> being taken care of.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>How am I trolling? I’m just telling you why they’re called minors. Like you can be 18 and get a MIP (minor in possession) charge for having alcohol, because you’re too young for that activity. Same thing applies to sex. </p>

<p>Plus, some states (like mine) have laws that say 14-17 year olds can have sex with each other, just not anyone over or under those ages. And Romeo and Juliet laws usually apply to fringe cases where someone has an earlier birthday than their girlfriend/boyfriend. </p>

<p>And you’re implying people are becoming autistic because they can’t have sex? You seem very oddly high strung about this issue, for someone who apparently doesn’t think fucking 14 year olds is okay. </p>

A &quot;minor&quot; is a legal term meaning someone is too young to vote, purchase alcohol, join the armed forces or have sex with someone who is legally an &quot;adult&quot;.  A person who has not reached puberty is prepubescent which is a biological term, not a legal term.  Just because someone has reached puberty does not mean they are not legally a minor.  In other words, keep your hands off a 14 year old if you are over 18 and want to stay out of prison.</p>

When there&#39;s an instance where it reflects back on &quot;their side&quot; they ignore it. Someone frothing at the mouth about pizzagate should be equally furious if it turned out that someone like our president was involved or supported a pedophile, but they aren&#39;t. If anything, the whole pizzagate frenzy turns people off of a lot of this stuff. It&#39;s easier to disregard real conspiracies involving pedophilia because it gets lumped into partisan bullshit. I don&#39;t think pizzagate is the only conspiracy doing that either, the conspiracy world is full of more disinfo than ever and it seems to only be getting worse. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I could be considered a “pizzagater”, in the sense that I have spent the past year doing exhaustive research on the case. However, because of my own experiences as a child abused by a ring in the late 80s and early 90s, I know that political allegiance is irrelevant in these groups. Republican or democrat, labour or conservative, if you desire to abuse other human beings, you’ll do it. Too much conjecture with pizzagate for it to be used to build a case but there is documented evidence to suggest that 1: politicians and known associates were communicating in a coded language and 2: a “family restaurant” in DC is not only hosting highly questionable performances on the premises, is owned by a man deeply connected to the Washington political elite, a man who’s social media presence was unsettling. I, like many others, wanted a thorough investigation by DC police and did not just assume that Hillary was running a child trafficking ring.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s the most insane shit I&#39;ve read. I really never looked into this even though some posts are on here. That post this guy did is amazing proof and detail. Why aren&#39;t more of these Kids that went through this speaking out? I know some are killed and he said a few were even jailed. But their has to be a bunch more. In my 20&#39;s I was backpacking Europe and went to Germany. It was late and I wanted a beer and there was only one bar that I found. I went inside and sat at the bar and didn&#39;t really see anything strange. The lady asked what are you doing here? I started to ramble about my trip and she stopped me. She said this bar is for men to sleep with little boys. I was confused and looked around. There was plenty of old men but no kids. Then I see some young kid maybe 15 come down these stairs and go up with a man. I&#39;ve never been so sick and left. It&#39;s been 20 years and I&#39;ll never forget it. Quite honestly I don&#39;t understand what is going on. Why is this so widespread with links to devil worship and high level people. Wiki says this pedophile is a mental illness. But clearly these people are organized and bright people given their positions. I&#39;m lost...what the fuck is going on.</p>

    <div class="md"><p><a href="http://saturndeathcult.com">Pedophilia is part of the blackmail network that keeps everyone in line.</a>. The Satanic &amp; Devil Worship stuff is to make it abhorrent and incomprehensible as possible to the regular person. It’s like Training Day- the dirty cops  cant trust Ethan Hawkes character after he doesn’t take the bribe. He’s in a situation where he’s routinely witnessing them doing crooked activities without partaking himself - what’s to say he doesn’t sing one day? Or grow a conscience and tell the “normies” how badly they’re  being screwed and fucks the whole scam up for everyone? But if all participants are engaged in behaviour so depraved they’d be universally condemned, they’re safe to operate without the fear of any future reprisals.</p>

<p>I’m not sure how far along your journey you might be but i wrote a post that attempts to outline the state of affairs, linking the respective conspiracies that have contributed to getting us here. Feel free to respond with any Q’s.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Good post. However I stand by my view that Pizzagate/Comet Ping Pong should be investigated. The term &quot;Fake News&quot; was created by the MSM to cover up Pizzagate. Look up the Google Analytics. I believe the Comet Ping Pong shooting was a false flag. Hours before the shooting, the street cameras were turned. Shooter Edgar Welch has an acting portfolio. Prior to the shooting, Welch had accidentally run over a young boy with his car. I believe his father has ties to Haiti. I know for sure Edgar has ties to Haiti. Also Edgar Welch fired a single shot directly into Comet Ping Pong&#39;s computer tower. All of this is very suspicious. </p>

<p>I really appreciate your post, but someone with so much knowledge about elite pedophilia should recognize that the Pizzagate scandal checks all of the boxes of a massive coverup. </p>

<p>Do not dismiss Pizzagate. </p>

<p>The fingerprint is one action that produces multiple outcomes, all of which serve the larger strategy. </p>

<p>It hardcore reinforces the PG narrative for those that already believe it, and recruits more from the alternative hypothesizing community by being an obvious FF. Selling the PG narrative to the population that it is designed to appeal to is to the benefit of the real elite child abusers for reasons I explain in another comment on this post. PG is both a smokescreen and a well-poisoning tactic, essentially. </p>

<p>To the majority that swallows the narrative without question, it exploits the fear of rogue gunmen the media has nurtured. Traumatic conditioning which connects &quot;fake news&quot;(unauthorized narratives) to this reserve of mortal terror. A great many will then defend official narratives as if their lives depend upon them being true.</p>

<p>And the continued effort to convince the population to disarm itself. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I go where the evidence takes me. A selection of claims McKinney has endorsed is that the US military shot and killed 5000 prisoners during Katrina and dumped their bodies, a multitude of 9/11 conspiracy theories (unsurprisingly), and that Jeb Bush was running a drug ring out of Columbia while he was governor of Florida. Conspiracy theories concerning famous assassinations endorsed by McKinney include believing that James Earl Ray did not kill Martin Luther King Jr., that Lee Harvey Oswald did not kill JFK, that Sirhan Sirhan did not kill Robert F. Kennedy, and – particularly vehemently – that Biggie did not kill Tupac.  You can that sane? She tried to beat the shit out of a Capital policeman. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Honestly, I try to be pretty skeptical myself. But there are some crazy things that are so well documented as to move from &quot;theory&quot; into the realm of fact.

    <div class="md"><p>Regarding Aquino, this is from one of u/LawOfAttraction33&#39;s phenomenal [archived posts] from 2013. (<a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/lawofattraction33?count=25&amp;amp;after=t1_c9hrqxv">https://www.reddit.com/user/lawofattraction33?count=25&amp;amp;after=t1_c9hrqxv</a>) </p>

<p>Unfortunately, the next step in this expose takes us to truly bizarre and disturbing places. A particularly disturbing child abuse case involving a military day care center came to light in 1987. Allegations of abuse involving 60 children, some infants, surfaced at the Presidio military base in San Francisco. I would like to point out that this article claims that child abuse allegations had surfaced at more than 30(!!!) military day care centers across the country in the previous 3(!!!!) years before its publishing, including some of the most esteemed bases such as West Point and Fort Dix. It would be impossible to lay out the cases for each one here, but I would like to share this quote from the San Jose Mercury News: “Children at West Point told stories that would become horrifyingly familiar. They said they had been ritually abused. They said they had had excrement smeared on their bodies and been forced to eat feces and drink urine. They said they were taken away from the day care center and photographed. “ At the Presidio, at least 4 children were found to have chlamydia, and up to 60 had shown clear signs of abuse. The most important exposes into the Presidio case were written by Linda Goldston of the San Jose Mercury News. In an article titled 44, “Abuse Case at Presidio Quietly Closed By U.S.”, the events are told in chilling detail. The first victims to come forward were aged 3 and 4. Interestingly, the Presidio child care center was not closed until over a year after these allegations came to light. Initially charges were only brought against one man, Gary Hambright, a civilian employee. Later, however, it was revealed that police were investigating a man named Michael Aquino, a Lt. Col. Aquino was the founder of a satanic church known as The Temple of Set. Army documents showed that children were often taken on unannounced trips outside the center, and many children could accurately describe Aquinos house. The search of Aquinos house got investigators thousands of videos and photographs, and what appeared to be a soundproof room, but charged were never brought against him.</p>

<p>Think about it. Let&#39;s say that you&#39;re a child molester operating a sex ring and you want to speak in code for security. Would you be using the type of shit they were using? If regular ass people at home can decipher your code so easily, I think it&#39;s fair to assume that these people weren&#39;t talking about what all the armchair forensic investigators think they were. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It has nothing to do with security. CP as an abbreviation for child porn has been used online for decades. It&#39;s more likely an inside joke that grew out of abusers dismissing accusations by insisting CP stands for something else, like cheese pizza.</p>

<p>All groups, societies etc have inside jokes, labels, tags, phrases. I see no reason why paedophile groups wouldn&#39;t be the same. They&#39;re not trying to be James Bond.</p>

And still ppl think this is a one off case and not a systemic problem that is institutionalised within the church. And that’s just one institution. It’s a horrible thing to face. But we as a society need to stand up. Otherwise were no better and we are responsible for covering it up, just like the no Pedo factory that is the Church. </p>

<p>It&#39;s taboo to even talk about it. People think <em>you&#39;re</em> the paedophile &quot;Omg why are you even interested in this?&quot;. </p>

<p>I agree that we need to do something as a society but I&#39;m at loss as to what. We keep bickering about what specific way kids are trafficked on this sub and it&#39;s bullshit because our energies could be focussed on shining a light on this issue. Again, I am at a loss as to how we can do it. </p>

<p>It felt more like he had no choice but to come out, and that too many stupid people (and reporting outlets) made their stories about that rather than about his sexual abuse allegations. But I&#39;m not sure how he could have navigated that situation without outing himself, other than by pulling a blatant lie and denying everything.

<p>It rounds up the more credulous of the population and funnels then down a rabbithole that goes nowhere. At the same time, it taints the huge amount of good, verifiable info out there about organized elite pedophilia, so that people reflexively reject it as the same baseless crazy bullshit. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Stuff like this loses a lot of steam as soon as hacky, hyper partisan, bad actors take up the cause and try to spotlight it for their own self gain and the popularity/tube viewers/clicks that come with it. Ecspecially around an election, and accusing a presidential candidate directly, average people become extremely skeptical and are very quick to dismiss it out of hand or do the exact opposite, accept and loudly accuse, with out researching the legitimacy of the evidence. 
Right now, if there is something that looks legit, the worst thing that you can hear is that Alex Jones is championing the cause. He is a giant snake oil salesman, bad actor. </p>

I haven&#39;t met a single person who denies that exists.  The issue is, when certain high profile personalities jump up and down and swear that there is a place that caters to one type of politician in particular or one party in particular, with obvious disinformation, they are undermining the credibility of any other large scale, hard to fathom but probable cartels.  Makes me think that the person providing the disinformation might be doing it for a specific reason....but that&#39;s my conspiracy.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Laura Sislby was the only person the Clinton&#39;s didn&#39;t get released. She served time in jail in Haiti.</p>

<p>This rumour began with a PleadingtheYiff post on The_Donald</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Written by user “PleadingtheYiff,” the post attempts to link the Clinton campaign to Laura Silsby, an Idaho missionary who served a six-month prison sentence in Haiti after the organization she founded, New Life Children’s Refuge, attempted to transport 33 Haitian children to the Dominican Republic after the 2010 Haiti earthquake.</p>

<p>The user’s primary proof of links between the Clintons and Silsby: “Huma Abedin was constantly forwarding Hillary articles on this woman’s organization.” The post provides no email sent from Clinton to Abedin regarding the incident.</p>

<p>The theory then includes a major error.</p>

<p>“One of the first things Hillary did when she took over the scene in Haiti was to get Laura off the hook,” PleadingtheYiff writes, then links to a website called “AboveTopSecret.com.”</p>

<p>Silsby wasn’t freed and instead remained incarcerated in Haiti, where she faced trial and was found guilty. The nine other missionaries jailed alongside her were freed.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The Podesta e-mails piqued my interest, but it was researching and finding out on my own the sheer number of investigations there <strong>aren&#39;t</strong> that convinced me of the broader pedogate. All of these separate incidents are treated as thought they happen in a vacuum.  And, often, there&#39;s wayyyy more people implicated than are even considered &quot;of interest&quot;.  For example, the testimony of the kids involved in the Boystown/King/Franklin events indicated over 400 different &quot;jons&quot;.  But nobody was prosecuted except King.  DynCorp got kid-glove treatment as well and are still getting govt contracts.  And that whole Finders thing... creepy AF.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is a great question. </p>

<p>I&#39;m not entirely sure whether or not a hormone would cause this, but rather genetics. Please note that is theoretical and I am in no way trying to say this is absolutely what causes it. However, I am saying what I have read prior. </p>

<p>Back before people could travel wherever they had the means to, people would generally stay in the same area their entire lives. Which would create region specific gene pools. In the regions where the average age of death was lower, it would only make sense for males that were attracted to younger females to survive over the males that were attracted to older. That would explain hebephilia, the attraction to early and mid stages of puberty. It is theorized that pedophilia is a disorder in hebephilic men, causing them to be attracted to females younger than needed. But what makes the jump between hebephilia and pedophilia? I have no idea. It might be intelligence or the way they think, but I&#39;m just shooting in the dark here. </p>

<p>I hope this helps your understanding of it. Sorry if it is a little hard to grasp, I feel like I kept jumping from point to point without much explanation in between. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Years ago Tom Lykos had a caller that was an 18 year old boy. He said his parents were influential in Hollywood and would have parties.</p>

<p>The part that got me was the transactional sex with minors he described. He said that around 15/16 years old he was having sex with men with the expectation that a gift would arrive the following week.</p>

<p>This transaction was unspoken. The child would simply wakeup with a brand new Mercedes in the drive with their name on it, or whatever.</p>

<p>He implied that the parents knew and contrary to what the common perception is, it isn&#39;t the parents spoiling their children with these outrageous purchases but instead they are understood payments for sex.</p>

<p>Anyone have a link to that particular interview. Must&#39;ve been around 2002-2003.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>”It’s so common in Hollywood it’s considered an open secret.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That is because the <em>status of actors has never changed, people simply assumed that it did</em>.  Most everyone knows from history that in the past actors and actresses where considered a disreputable occupation; essentially prostitutes for wealthy patrons of the theatre.  This is true of Victorian England, The Roman Republic/Empire, Medieval France, Biblical times, etc and on into most other ancient cultures.  Only when theatre was entwined with religion (as in Ancient Greece) was this <em>perhaps</em> not the case.</p>

<p>So, the system has never changed, no one ever proclaimed that it changed, everyone just <em>assumed</em> that it changed or overlooked the obvious.</p>

<p>“Open secret” could be better said as “grand tradition” here.</p>

There is a Guns and Butter podcast episode featuring Lori Handrahan who has been researching child trafficking for 30 years which is well worth listening to as well. She doesn’t make any speculations into Pizzagate, all of her research has evidence in the form of official documents from lawsuits and whatnot to back it up and it is shocking to say the least. <a href="https://m.soundcloud.com/guns-and-butter-1/americas-traffic-in-child-pornography-lori-handrahan-381">America’s Traffic in Child Pornography</a>.

Probably because satanic cults and pedo rings still sounds just a bit too surreal, at least compared with your garden variety ring run by Catholic priests. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I believe pizzagate <em>because</em> of all these storys, ive grown up in care hearing storys from numerous care staff of elite/rich/powerfull peado rings so im well aware that it is a very real phenomena, and my ears now prick up on every peado story for years, alot of the real stuff like OP mentioned is buried in the noise of shit known as &quot;pizzagate&quot;, the problem is that even the most credible storys still all have unbelievable aspects because the scale is hard for people to imagine. But in my experience &quot;pizzagate&quot; wouldnt have happened at all if &quot;they&quot; didnt want it to and the &quot;noise&quot; is kind of a marker for somthing being hidden. Was pizzagate the noise to hide pedogate? Maybe as a cover for Maddeline Mcann? It happened around the time the press embargo was lifted on the podestas photofit and the P.I. who commisioned it was killed, it was slotted into the pizzagate scene quite whole, thats my suspicion. The fact is that the foxes are running the hen house, foxes who have their own planes, trucks, connections, houses built with secret rooms etc and access to information that keeps them a step a head, The foxes built the very system that they use for their sick ends and almost always presented in the name of somthing holy or good, a form of camoflauge which also makes it harder to discern what exactly is going on.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/1cm0t3/original_research_the_mountain_of_evidence_for_a/?st=JHLX80T4&amp;amp;sh=3623c005">People in this sub have been beating this drum for years.</a>. The link contains as good a piece of work I’ve ever encountered researching a global pedophile ring, in each locale seemingly protected by the highest bodies. The fact it’s dated 5 years ago and we’re still collectively stunned by revelations in 2018, speaks volumes on just how work has gone into concealing this evil.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think Pizzagate was projection, a distraction, and a way to sow division. </p>

<p>I also think the current administration is ramping <em>up</em> the government&#39;s child sex trafficking operations through the separation of immigrant children from the parents. I think Pizzagate and Q are misdirection. Q is convincing the very people who might catch on to what&#39;s going on, conspiracy theorists, that there&#39;s &quot;nothing to see here, folks, those over there are the <em>real</em> pedos, just ignore this administration&#39;s horrific treatment of immigrant children and setting up of the perfect circumstances for trafficking. Nope, it&#39;s <em>all</em> being taken care of.&quot;</p>
