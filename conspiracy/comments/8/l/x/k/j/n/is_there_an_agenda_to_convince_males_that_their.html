        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I know a lot of men in their thirties and forties who spend most of their lives at work, with very little time (or energy) to put into what they really care about in life.</p>

<p>Music, games, drinking a few beers with their mates on weekends... these are the kinds of things they want to do with their time, but they feel like they rarely get to be who they want to be, because they are too busy &#39;being a good dad/husband&#39;.</p>

<p>This usually means doing as they are told by their manager at work (&#39;can&#39;t afford to lose my job, too many bills to pay&#39;) and their wife at home (&#39;happy wife, happy life&#39;).</p>

<p>These men usually get very little say in how their own children are raised. The school has FAR more say in what the child believes than the father.</p>

<p>Why is it a man&#39;s job to work his ass off, and give up on his own passions and hopes, to pay for a family (who often do not respect his opinion)? Who convinced us that this is fair or reasonable? And why are the men on TV shows portrayed as idiots, people to be disrespected? Is it a coincidence?</p>

<p>The amazing thing is that I also know several men who only work part-time but have more moey to spend on what they want than the men described above. Why? No family to worry about, so they are able to live frugally and peacefully. Nobody &#39;needs&#39; to work full time <em>unless</em> other people (i.e. the family) are spending the money they are earning.</p>

<p>Is it time for young men to question WHY they have been raised to believe it is their job to pay for a family?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Whew, so many things here. First off I am sorry that you have had that experience with your family or those around you. Life isn&#39;t supposed to be that way, imo. A family is all about give and take. Depending on the situation sometimes one spouse has to give more than the other for a little while, and it should balance out in the long run. I can tell you that many women I know express these same feelings just from the other side. It&#39;s shit to feel like your unappreciated. I am not sure where you live but my husband and myself are both working professionals and it would be very difficult to be financially stable if we only had one income. We&#39;ve both taken turns going to college, I went while he put in time with the Army and worked part time and this month he just completed his master&#39;s after I supported our family for the last five years and he interned part time. Now he is set to go with his career, I am quitting my career and opening my own agency. Lol. It never ends..the give and take is a vital part to making a marriage survive.. the rest of the stuff will fall right into place. I know that was extremely long winded... I am not going to apologize for it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>If we remember Alex Jonesies&#39; bohemian Grove vids and the &quot;cremation of care&quot; I wonder how many wondered wtf that phrase even means. These years later I think despite Alex&#39;s shenanigans, that ceremony/ritual is actually an apt keyhole into &quot;projects&quot; which op presents here. &quot;Care&quot; is equivalent to compassion and elitists apparently equate this philosophy with weakness and stupidity. They also cultivate their children in highly regimented life routines and roles, leading to what we see in the elitist adult habits of ruthlessness and generally not giving a fuck (caring). On the contrary, the advertising, marketing and consumer &quot;goods&quot; (many ain&#39;t so good) they foist on the unwashed masses are essentially the opposite philosophy; &quot;be dumb, be selfish, be a glutton&quot;. In other words we are forced to &quot;care&quot; about debased behavior and either join in other mob mentalities or harass each other for no reason. The ridiculous gender roles we are constantly confused about are part and parcel it seems. Guys impregnating way more women than they can afford is celebrated, just like op states. Welfare seems like a bottomless cup. The industrial age has multiplied a bunch of crap we don&#39;t need, much of it now floating in the middle of the Pacific...and at the same rate multiplied the planetary population. The worst part is how this population growth is also correlated to apparent kidnapping and unsolved disappearances as law enforcement purports to not have sufficient resources to end this monstrosity</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I’m in my 40s and have no kids , I own a business and make a pretty decent amount of money doing what I like, I actually look forward to waking up early and going to the job sight and doing my labor intensive job for 9 to 10 hours a day because I’m not a pussy . By the way not only do I do all the jobs by myself I also get the jobs, get materials ,do the books ,answer phones do the taxes everything in-house, I wouldn’t trade my position for anything . </p>

<p>The sole agenda here is money , if you choose to have a family that comes with huge responsibility and people that find themselves in that scenario often know that and choose that route, you personally don’t have to do that </p>

<p>Money = access how you get it is solely up to you what you do with it is up to you. Settling for some fucked up shit job and existence is solely up to the individual. I could go on and tell you how fucked up I was for years , it’s was because hated the system so I made my own fucking system </p>

<p>Do men get to have any say in whether or not a pregnant woman keeps the child?</p>

<p>No.</p>

<p>Therefore, unwilling males are indeed forced to have children they don&#39;t want. Every single day this is happening.</p>

<p>It is easy to say, &#39;then don&#39;t have sex&#39;. This does not change the fact that many men are unwillingly becoming fathers to children they never planned to have.</p>

<p>Not only this, but government-funded indoctrination institutions (such as schools and universities) train people to repeat the mantra that this is how it should be: &#39;womans body womans choice&#39;.</p>

<p>There are many men out there who have been trapped. &#39;My pill didn&#39;t work&#39;, &#39;I forgot&#39;.</p>

<p>Those who deny this reality are pushing an agenda.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, I don&#39;t think OP is retarded. I&#39;ve seen <a href="/u/Step2TheJep">/u/Step2TheJep</a> on here quite a bit. He seems like a good guy. But I do think he hasn&#39;t met the right woman yet. His friends seem to be either immature or with the wrong people too.</p>

<p>When you meet the right person (somebody you love and they love you just as much too) then your perspective/views change.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve been happily married for 22 years. For me, it has just gotten better each day that goes by! No, it isn&#39;t perfect. No marriage is perfect. But it is perfect for me! My husband seems to be quite happy too.</p>

<p>He mentioned sex too. About not having sex that much when you are married. Well, that is true sometimes. </p>

<p>Now, I&#39;m about to give probably more information that some people might want (and it has nothing to do with conspiracy) but here goes! When my husband and I were dating, we had sex all the time! It was the best! Whew! Man, I miss those days! Then we got married and children came along. Well, <a href="/u/Step2TheJep">/u/Step2TheJep</a> needs to realize that it is normal that the sex dwindles after having children. Children take up a lot of time and energy! So yes, we didn&#39;t (and still don&#39;t) have sex as often as we used to, but when we do it is still awesome! The quantity may not be there, but the quality is! My husband says the quality of the sex is like the glue of the marriage! He is right too. We&#39;ve been married 22 years and sex for us is still awesome! Actually, it is better! The more time you are with somebody, the more trust you develop. So things you might have wanted to try when you were dating (but were afraid to ask), well, I think you all understand what I&#39;m trying to say.</p>

<p>No, nothing that kinky! Get your mind out of the gutters! But my husband has dressed as pirate for me! He swings from the chandelier and pretends to board my ship to kidnap me! I won&#39;t bot into details, but let&#39;s just say pillaging and plundering takes place! Actually, this is how he hurt his back! LOL! I&#39;m just joking. (Or am I?)</p>

<p>Okay, way too long of a post. Okay, back to conspiracies! </p>

<p>My post was about society and people today. Not about me.</p>

<p>So why are people focusing on me? Because they have been trained to shame those who dare question the system.</p>

<p>In today&#39;s society, people who opt out of marriage and family are more accepted than they have ever been. So I do not think there is a hidden agenda to make males get married, work full time and pay for a family.</p>

<p>Do you believe men should have more than mere influence on an abortion? It would be an appalling violation for the mother to be forced into having an abortion, or giving up their child for adoption.</p>

<p>Therefore, unwilling males are indeed forced to have children they don&#39;t want. Every single day this is happening.</p>

<p>No. I believe that he should be given the <strong>option</strong> of being the <em>legal</em> father. If he ticks the &#39;no&#39; box then he should have no responsibility (legal or financial) to the child or the mother if she then chooses to go ahead with the pregnancy.</p>

But I think it&#39;s less of an agenda and more just a reflection of the level we&#39;re at as a human race. The more evolved we become and further apart we diverge from our animal roots, where all this &quot;men have to do this, women have to do that&quot; programming comes from, the more free we will be able to live. People think that&#39;s what&#39;s happening to humans right now and consider it progress, but I don&#39;t think we&#39;re really truly evolving like that yet... today it&#39;s more like people are fighting against their animal instincts rather than naturally growing out of them, so instead of evolving, they&#39;re just getting weaker and more miserable.</p>

<p>It is so often the people claiming to value truth who attack it the most viciously.</p>

<p>What did I write in the OP that is incorrect? Nothing.</p>

<p>The reality is that a lot of men in their thirties, forties and even fifties now find themselves trapped in a domestic situation whereby they are effectively plantation slaves.</p>

<p>They have to go to work to earn the money to be spent by the wife and/or children. If the man decides that he wants to go in a new direction in life, then he must be willing to lose his home and family if she decides that he is not allowed to leave his job.</p>

<p>This is what she married him for, after all.</p>

<p>&#39;No, no, women marry for love&#39;. Yeah, in Disney films. Why do you think that crap is promoted so heavily to children? Because the young boys are going to be the plantation workers in a few years time, and then for the rest of their lives. Program them to believe in &#39;true love&#39; so they get stuck on the plantation in their twenties. Suckers for life.</p>

<p>Eating meals as a family is a great time to bond as a family. Our family meal times are about 45 minutes and has everyone asking what their plans are for the day at breakfast and how was their day at dinner. </p>

<p>I can see your point, but some people I hear that say “I have no time for me or my family” are ones that pull themselves away. They have a hard time compartmentalizing work from home and take hours to destress from their job and that carries into home. This is a major issue with high stress jobs.    </p>
