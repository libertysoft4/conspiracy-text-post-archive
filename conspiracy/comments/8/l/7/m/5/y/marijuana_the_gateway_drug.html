        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Just a recent thought I&#39;ve been having, I first smoked weed in my early 20s and continued to regularly do so until I was 25. </p>

<p>I didn&#39;t do any other altering substances, be it beer and liquor sometimes. </p>

<p>Weed was my go to, to relax and think. </p>

<p>By the time I was 24 I decided to mushrooms, I did so and it was great, did it a handful of times and felt great after consuming them and exploring that side of psychedelics. </p>

<p>Then, I delved into MDMA which again was a very nice experience, especially doing it with mushrooms, it was very freeing to the body and mind. </p>

<p>Finally, I took the plunge and did LSD, way too much of it for the first time, but that is what changed me forever, the experience woke me up, I haven&#39;t done it since I was 24 and every time I smoke weed, I need to be careful or I&#39;ll have a acid flash back and remember all I have concluded from my experience. </p>

<p>This is just my thoughts on why all 4 of these drugs are still schedule 1 in the United States and seen as a threat to society, because they&#39;re to tools to wake you up from the system that is using us. </p>

Our systems of government, health, and law enforcement are designed with the lowest common denominator in mind, not the highest. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I smoke weed.  I&#39;ve tried other drugs, but would have tried them, regardless of whether or not I smoked weed.</p>

<p>I do not do other drugs, have not since I was 25.  I don&#39;t drink alcohol, haven&#39;t smoked since I was in my 20s, and have no desire to do anything beyond smoking weed as my vice.</p>

<p>I never bought into the gateway drug line of thinking.  I think people against marijuana use it as a slippery slope argument without acknowledging that correlation != causation.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve done acid plenty of times, and all I got from it was that it tends to blur the line between reality and your imagination. It tricks you into thinking you&#39;re having grand, profound thoughts, but you&#39;re really just going in circles, self-rationalizing whatever it is you&#39;re thinking about and then forgetting about it 5-10 minutes later. You&#39;re really certain that whatever it is you&#39;re dreaming up is absolutely true, though.</p>

<p>I wouldn&#39;t say you&#39;ve been woken up so much as you let it trick you. You have to be careful when in an altered state of mind you don&#39;t understand, and you have to be cognizant of the fact that you were in an altered state of mind when remembering the experience. We may be looking at reality through the warped lens of our brains, but our brains on acid are just a differently-warped lens, not clarity.</p>

<p>And Yes, for may of us Marijuana is the gateway drug.  We are told that Drugs are bad and dangerous.  Then we try marijuana.  It seems so not dangerous, so we try other things. </p>
