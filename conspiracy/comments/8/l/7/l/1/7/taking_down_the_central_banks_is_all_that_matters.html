<p>About the rotschilds i found a great comment on them:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The Rothschild family divested themselves of regular commercial banking interests in the early 1990s and now manage investments for extremely wealthy clients under their company, Rothschild Global Advisory, providing services such as equity advice and restructuring debt. The Rothschild’s firm handled the $21 billion dollar merger of 3 Coca Cola bottlers, ABN AMRO’s IPO raising $3.8 billion dollars, Al Noor Hospitals $6.8 billion dollar merger with Mediclinic and Intel’s $16.7 billion dollar acquisition of Altera.  </p>

<p>The Rothschild’s are still involved in banking, but only for high net worth individuals and provide fixed deposits, current accounts, Visa cards, internet banking service and foreign currency exchange facilities.  </p>

<p>While actual owners of the Federal Reserve, the people themselves, are unknown, the Federal Reserve is still essentially owned by the member banks. How the 6&amp;#37; profit the Federal Reserve takes is dispatched is also unknown.  </p>

<p>The Rockefeller family wealth surpassed the Rothschilds in the mid-1930s and my personal opinion is that the Rockefeller family has had and still has far more wealth, power and influence than the Rothschilds and in fact, I believe most of the nonsense about Rothschild ruling the world was posted to the internet by employees of the Rockefeller family.  </p>

<p>The Rockefellers founded the Council on Foreign Relations and the Trilateral Commission and these two organizations are responsible for recommending and setting American foreign policy. They also founded the United Nations, numerous medical schools and colleges and dozens of NGOs and non-profit organizations. They’re involved heavily in petroleum and natural gas, founded museums, universities, philanthropic foundations, and some of the country&#39;s biggest national parks. Their petroleum interests mean they’re at the head of the table when US foreign policy is discussed, planned and implemented.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>it hasn&#39;t been entirely stable in history because we&#39;ve had the same group of people causing the instability since the existence of money. There were some governments, the most recent and known one the nazi governement, who took control over the money system and you know how it turned out, these gruops of predators did all they could to regain control, and succeded. The next try at shifting the power over money are cryptocurrencies, but these groups are already working overtime at keeping their control through regulations and negative media attention.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think you got something wrong, in history it was not the same people, the nazis did what? (im german), this is so wrong dude. There is one thing that is called swift and Dollar, which is what gives us the stability that we live in which has never been higher or better in history. Cryprocurrencies are a pain in the ass and a hype that will die sooner than later as the &quot;BIS&quot; (most powerfull bank of the World, or called &quot;BIZ &quot; in german) announced it&#39;s fight and stance against bitcoin (not cryprocurrencies in general). The biggest baddie out there is the milton friedman founded &quot;montpellier society&quot;, you may read up on it if you like, they are the most Powerfull think tank of the World and are the neoliberal in persona</p>

    <div class="md"><p>JFK asked Congress to end silver certificates. Congress passed the law, which also authorized the Federal Reserve print new, smaller denomination bills, and JFK signed it. The day he signed the law, he also issued <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_Order_11110">Executive Order 11110</a>, which enabled the Treasury to keep printing silver certificates as long as necessary (until the new Federal Reserve notes were ready).</p>

<p>That&#39;s what EO 11110 was actually about. It was part of JFK&#39;s plan to stop printing silver certificates. JFK&#39;s plan was the <em>opposite</em> of the conspiracy theory about it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>OP&#39;s statement is somewhat vague, however to take the central banks down would most likely result in a worldwide financial crash, initially. Their key roles are to supervise and regulate banking firms and also to maintain financial stability. Without an institution to create and maintain financial legislation would allow commercial banks (the ones your actually want to be mad at) and others to then &quot;do what they like.&quot; Only serious reform of banking practice legislation and maybe even the structure of Central Banks will result in the desired effect.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;Islamic Finance&quot; is somewhat different to western banking. Their practices are considered much more ethical as interest payments are banned. They use various forms of profit sharing so that both the user and the lender share wealth and share risk.

    <div class="md"><p>What a fantastic point.  I’m not sure this is the root cause as the two groups religious ideologies aren’t compatible at a fundamental level.  That said, I have honestly never thought of the conflict in terms of interest charging.  That really does make an incredible amount of sense.  I think I have to go research what both religions specifically say about interest now.  Thanks for giving me something to think about.</p>

<p>Seriously I&#39;m sure there is evidence but I&#39;m going to disagree with OP&#39;s stance and a stance I held for many years: you can no longer beat them conventionally. The Powers That Be has reached such a saturation point in traditional theaters of engagement that you cannot challenge them through politics or violence. The ONLY way we get the power to the people is by building a power structure for them. The Tower of Babel doesn&#39;t look so impressive standing next to the Tower of the Kingdom of Heaven on Earth, which as we all know, is inherited by the meek and the poor in material but wealthy in spirit.</p>

Instead every country in the global system takes loans from private banks and racks up an ungodly amount of debt. Last year my county spent more money servicing their interest payments on debts to these banks than they did on unemployment insurance. </p>

<p>It&#39;s this whole long story but basically the original bitcoin developers got kicked out and now btc development is done by blocks team which is in part owned by axa.</p>

<p>Old money has taken over bitcoin and is pushing the narrative that it can&#39;t be a currency because of the fees. There&#39;s a huge disinformation/censorship campaign about it on <a href="/r/bitcoin">/r/bitcoin</a>.</p>

<p>So basically with bitcoin cash (which should be called bitcoin) the original movement that bitcoin was about continues. </p>

<p>There are thinkers of the past who contend that most humans are simply not ready to think for themselves. It is not in their nature. They simply go about their lives, living day to day, concerned only with the immediate (food, shelter, sex, gossip, etc).</p>

<p>Perhaps this sub can never be what we might like it to be in the ideal world, because this is not the ideal world. It is a world full of simple people who are easily triggered into emotional outbursts and petty point-scoring.</p>

<p>This is just how they are.</p>

<p>You seem like you mean well so I wish you nothing but happiness and prosperity.</p>

Of course you can have a currency without it being owned and controlled by a privately owned entity that charges interest on every dollar created-so the debt is inherently perpetual.

<p>Confirmation bias is a rough thing to overcome, but it allows for some of the deepest growth.</p>

<p>No one is right 100&amp;#37; of the time about 100&amp;#37; of things, and its encouraging to see discourse is still alive and well despite some efforts to stifle it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Again, So Everyone &quot;Gets&quot; It</p>

<p>Again-- the power structure in this country is supposed to run like this:</p>

<p>People &gt; Republics &gt; Counties &gt; States &gt; The United States &gt; The United States of America / Federal United States dba &quot;United States&quot; &gt; Territorial United States dba &quot;United States of America&quot;  &gt; Municipal United States dba Municipality of Washington, DC</p>

<p>You will notice that in your lifetime there is only fleeting mention of the Republics and that the Federal United States has been confused both with The United States and with incorporated businesses doing business as the &quot;UNITED STATES&quot; and the Territorial United States has been confused both with The United States of America and with incorporated businesses doing business as the &quot;United States of America&quot;. </p>

<p>All this confusion about who is who and what is what is being used to promote fraud of all kinds against the people and actual States.  Certain parties have gotten very rich from orchestrating this confusion and all these &quot;similar names deceits&quot; ---- and they don&#39;t want to give it up.  They have also exercised coercive and war-making powers that they have no right to exercise.  They don&#39;t want to give that up, either. </p>

<p>The fact remains that they are criminals for promoting, aiding, abetting, assisting, or profiting from this circumstance, and anyone who knows what is going on who doesn&#39;t take immediate action to stop it, is either an active or passive accomplice to international crime of a most heinous nature.</p>

The only reason it has hanged on this long is because every market and every indicator number is being manipulated to prop it up long enough for them to control the collapse and bring in the reset. This reset will involve a cashless fiat currency. Unless someone uses the collapse to justify a real and full audit of the FED that results in unfavorable blame for the collapse and hardship and exposes corruption.  So it is all about who controls the narrative during the collapse. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, an audit is more or less an examination of proper maintenance of a process or institution as required by law. There is no rule of law for bitcoin, but thousands of developers contributing to an open source code base means an audit can occur whenever, wherever, by anyone with sufficient means.</p>

<p>Bitcoin itself (in case you weren&#39;t aware) is a means for transacting value in a completely trustless fashion (zero middleman and no risk of the counterparty not following through with the transaction). It is censorship resistant, has no governing body, and is deflationary (value increases over time instead of going down like the dollar).</p>

<p>Transacting with bitcoins removes banks from the equation since you are essentially your own bank, and increases transparency.</p>

<p>The caveat being there is no recourse for funds sent to a party that doesn&#39;t provide you with the product or service you requested.</p>

<p>The few redditors in here who actually have any idea what role central banks do and express a little skepticism at the idea &quot;kill the central banks&quot; are voted down into negative double digits. There are more than 170 central banks around the world, created by all sorts of governments over <em>centuries.</em> Is is really the case that all these governments were wrong and this lynch mob is right? If so, maybe you should have a little discussion of &quot;why?&quot;</p>

<p>More than one comment refers to Andrew Carrington Hitchcock&#39;s <em>hoax</em> about the Rothschilds controlling all central banks. At least there are a couple of people pointing out that there is <em>no</em> evidence for this hoax! People <em>could</em> discuss why they believe this weird theory, despite there being no evidence for it and tons of evidence against it.</p>

<p>One comment says &quot;Audit. The. FED.&quot; I wonder if this commenter knows that the Fed is audited every year. Does he know what Rand Paul wants to change about the audits and what pros and cons there are to the proposed changes? There <em>could</em> be discussion about that.</p>

<p>The only proposed replacements are Islamic banking, bartering, and digital currencies. Bartering? Seriously? Islamic banking? Are economies better in countries that practice it? Digital currencies? Maybe this magic pixie dust will work as a currency, maybe it won&#39;t, but in what way do you think it will be better than all the currencies that exist today?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Those are not the only proposed replacements at all.  You dont need a currency to be owned and controlled by a private entity that charges interest to have one.  Look up US history with central banks-the first two were rotted out in less than 20 years.  The Federal Reserve was literally conspired by international bankers (read the Creature from Jeckyl Island) and pushed through Congress via Puppet Aldrich during Christmas recess in 1913.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>By far most central banks have no private ownership at all. The only countries where there is any form of private shareholders at all are Belgium, Greece, Italy, Japan, South Africa, Switzerland, Turkey and the U.S. All the other 170+ central banks have no private shareholders. And in those 8 countries, there are a lot of restrictions on ownership.</p>

<p>The Federal Reserve does not charge interest on currency.</p>

<p>Well, there was one Jewish banker at the Jekyll Island meeting, if that&#39;s what you mean by &quot;international bankers.&quot;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>pushed through Congress via Puppet Aldrich during Christmas recess in 1913.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Nope. The Aldrich bill was introduced in Congress in 1910, but never brought to a vote. Part of Woodrow Wilson&#39;s platform in 1912 was reform of the banking and monetary system. After the 1912 elections, the Democrats controlled the House, Senate, and White House for the first time in more than a decade. They wrote a Democratic alternative to Aldrich&#39;s plan.</p>

<p>The House Banking Committee held extensive hearings about proposed reforms starting in January, even before Wilson was sworn in as President in March. They held hearings on January 7-9, 14-16, 21-22, 28-29 and February 5, 17, and 28. That testimony is collected in <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=ZREjAQAAMAAJ&amp;amp;printsec=frontcover">this volume</a> of more than 700 pages.</p>

<p>In June, President Wilson addressed a joint session of Congress, urging passage of a money reform bill: <em>New York Times</em>: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1913/06/24/archives/money-reform-now-is-wilsons-demand-tariff-shackles-off-business.html">&quot;MONEY REFORM NOW, IS WILSON&#39;S DEMAND&quot;</a>.</p>

<p>The Senate Banking Committee held hearings on September 2-6, 8, 16-20, 22-26, 29-30 and October 4, 6-7, 8-11, 13-17, 20-25, 27. The testimony is collected in three volumes (<a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=URA9AAAAYAAJ&amp;amp;pg=PR1">Vol. 1</a>, <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=fRE9AAAAYAAJ&amp;amp;pg=PA961">Vol. 2</a>, <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=EDsuAAAAYAAJ&amp;amp;pg=PR1">Vol. 3</a>), totalling more than 3000 pages.</p>

<p>The House of Representatives initially passed the bill on <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1913/09/19/archives/money-bill-passes-house-285-to-85-23-republicans-and-10.html">September 18.</a> by a vote of 286 to 85, with 23 Republicans and 10 Progressives voting for it. The Senate passed a different version of the bill on <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1913/12/20/archives/currency-bill-passes-senate-owen-measure-adopted-54-to-34-six.html">December 19</a>, by a vote of 54 to 34. A conference committee met to work out a compromise bill. The House passed the conference bill by an overwhelming vote of 298 to 60 on December 22. The Senate passed it the next day by a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_Federal_Reserve_System#Enactment_of_the_Federal_Reserve_Act_%281913%29">vote of 43 to 25.</a> We know for a fact that the outcome would be the same if the full Senate voted.</p>

<p>The idea that the Federal Reserve Act was some secret passed by just a few Congressman is just another myth.</p>

<p>We literally don&#39;t need a central bank. We don&#39;t need an institution to create currency and then charge interest on that currency. That only harms the American people at the expense of the very rich. This Central Banking cartel has its tentacles all over the world, which is why any country that resists them suffers. </p>

<p>There is a lot to be said on the subject, and you would be well served educating yourself before jumping to conclusions about how we&#39;re ignorant, when that is what you appear to be from my perspective.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Wait, you&#39;re talking about the <em>money supply</em>? That&#39;s different from <em>currency.</em> You should get your facts straight.</p>

<p>When people talk about the Fed raising or lowering interest rates, they&#39;re talking about the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_funds_rate">target Federal funds rate</a>. That is the rate that banks charge each other, not money that goes to the Fed. The Fed does do some lending of its own to banks, but that&#39;s usually minor, except during the financial crisis that started in 2008.</p>

<p>If we had some other monetary system based on, say, bitcoin, would banks stop lending money or would they just stop charging interest on loans? I venture to say that neither would happen.</p>

<p>Interest is charged on <em>borrowing</em>. Yes, when people borrow, that increases the money supply. That&#39;s how bank accounts work. It doesn&#39;t have anything to do with the <em>currency</em>. There is no interest charged on currency, only on borrowing.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You can&#39;t take down the central banks because governments love them. The first damned thing evil snake Hamilton wanted to do was set up a central bank.</p>

<p>So long as you have governments you will have central banks. Central banks are the most efficient way to transfer wealth from the producers to the ruling class. Taxes are obvious and they are forced to give some of the money they steal in taxes to dependent voters so they will always vote to keep the taxes. But the central bank has no such restrictions. <em>That</em> theft goes straight to the ruling class. That&#39;s the pure shit. That is how the majority of wealth diversity perpetuates.</p>

<p>You could try a written Constitution that explicitly forbade a central bank, but the 9th and 10th Amendments to the US Constitution already explicitly denied all non specific powers, and it was entirely ignored. So you could say &quot;AND WE ESPECIALLY MEAN NO CENTRAL BANKS&quot; but then a Supreme Court would arrogate the power to <em>interpret</em> the Constitution (as happened in Marbury vs Madison) and they would <em>interpret</em> &quot;NO CENTRAL BANKS&quot; to mean &quot;Yes central banks are allowed&quot;.</p>

<p>So there is no way to end them, and I don&#39;t even see a way they could be prevented. The US Constitution attempted to deny them, and it did not work.</p>

Instead every country in the global system takes loans from private banks and racks up an ungodly amount of debt.
