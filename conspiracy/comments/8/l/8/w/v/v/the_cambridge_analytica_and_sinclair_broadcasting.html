<p>Or like how now because Trump supports Israel, it&#39;s become ok for the MSM to bash Israel because grrrr Trump.</p>

<p>The thing that infuriates me, is that while he has certainly lifted the blinders for some, most just have selective blinders for when it&#39;s people or ideas that they disagree with. </p>

<p>The reason people see you that way is because it&#39;s possibly the worst way you can react. Instead of defending the problem or standing out against the problem, you recognize that there is a problem, and your reaction is to 1) act smug (why do you care, your side does it too) and 2) insist that the problem shouldn&#39;t be changed (if this was a problem you would have done it when it was &quot;your turn&quot;). When people point out a problem that you want changed, even if they&#39;re only recognizing one side, your reaction should not immediately be to suppress them from being interested and keep the status quo.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Where are the racism, minority scapegoating, sexism, conspiracy theories, and attacks on American institutions? And surely you understand the history of how that bill was finally able to pass, with massive concessions to and obstructionist efforts from Congressional Republicans. Of course the thing that comes out after two years of hashing out details with an adversarial Congress (remember when the Senate majority leader said his number one goal was to make Obama a one-term president?) is going to be different than the original vision.</p>

<p>What we can do is criticize Obama for the things he actually did wrong, like drone strikes, bank bailout, not closing gitmo, and getting invovled in Syria. What we can&#39;t do (and what is ultimately nothing more than a revisionist propaganda tactic) is try to say that all the wrong things Trumps is doing, Obama actually did and did to a worse degree. Trump criticism isn&#39;t off limits, unless you&#39;re an authoritarian bootlicker. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The racism is subtle until you see it.    Then when you see it, shit gets ugly and you see it everywhere.  A good place to start is in the left-wing reactions to Kanye and Candace Owens.  If you agree that Kanye and Candace are some sort of &quot;Uncle Tom&quot; then guess what you are part of the problem.</p>

<p>The idea that black people need to vote a certain way because of their skin color is wildly racist.</p>

<p>Minority scapegoating is also subtle.  Best starting point is to consider the default assumption that blacks are the ones deserving goverment support and by default are the ones penalized under drug laws.  Drug laws supported by both sides, but certainly including Democrats.</p>

<p>Sexism...many approaches to this one.  Misandry is of course sexism, but we have a few examples of liberal journalists saying that women assaulted by Democratic icons such as Harvey Weinstein should stay silent in order not to damage the Democratic party.  That&#39;s pretty ugly sexism if you ask me.</p>

<p>Conspiracy theories...muh Russia should suffice here.</p>

<p>Attacks on institutions...depends how you define institutions.  Consider that Christian churches are institutions.  Now consider the question again.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>A lot of grasping at straws and straw-manning in this comment. I&#39;m not going to address everything that&#39;s wrong in your comment, because each incorrect point needs an essay all to itself to fully refute. So here a few of the bigger ones.</p>

<p>I personally don&#39;t think Kaye is an &quot;Uncle Tom.&quot; I personally don&#39;t use that pejorative to describe anyone, actually. I don&#39;t agree with Kanye&#39;s politics, but then, I also don&#39;t lend much credence to the political positions of random celebrities, outside of how they express it in their art. And, I don&#39;t think T_D or any conservative talking heads would give a flying shit about Kanye if he weren&#39;t vocally supportive of Trump. In fact, if he were rapping about themes like Donald Glover or Kendrick Lamar, T_D and conservative talking heads would probably treat him with as much racism and dismissal as has met Donald Glover&#39;s &quot;This Is America.&quot;</p>

<p>It&#39;s not untrue to say that there is racism in the Democrat party, especially among the white, wealthy elites. But it&#39;s a different kind of racism than the Trump campaign and voters espouse. If you&#39;re going to call out the racism in the Dem party, be intellectually honest and call it out in the Republicans, too. I really don&#39;t understand this insistence among T-D types that racism only actually exists on the Democratic side of American politics. It&#39;s sort of the same tactic used for almost any issue, whataboutism and redirection. No introspection, no self awareness.</p>

<p>I really don&#39;t think there&#39;s any comparison here. The Democrat party, a large majority of it anyway,has swiftly and aggressively exiled and disavowed its politicians and supporters when they are accused of these things. Meanwhile, of course, the President of the US has multiple persistent accusations against him and even open court cases related to sexual abuse or sexual-related charges. And people like Roy Moore are still in the public eye and are almost winning public elections despite their accusations. You can&#39;t, in good faith or with any bit of intellectual honesty, argue that the way that the Democrat party and the Republican party have handled sexual assault charges are even the slightest bit similar. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>How did he attack universities? </p>

<p>He bailed out the banks, essentially letting them off the hook for causing the financial crisis. And healthcare companies are making out rich off the affordable care act because now you are required by law to give them money. In fact, some of the biggest healthcare companies were intricately involved in crafting the bill in the first place. If anything, Obama helped all of those institutions. And besides, banks and healthcare companies are more capitalist institutions than American institutions, anyway.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Exactly. Our points are the same.</p>

<p>He pumped the corporations to a level where they&#39;re destroying themselves from within. When the government dumps unearned capital into the companies they are no longer institutions of the American people, but rather institutions of the &quot;capitalist&quot; ruling. Although a majority of the wealth was due to government intervention so I wouldn&#39;t necessarily call it capitalist. </p>

<p>Nevertheless they are beholden to the government, not the people. When they rely on the government for funding and not the people, they no longer feel the need to act in the interest of the people. It&#39;s pretty common throughout history and to me should be obvious. Corporate bailouts and subsidies are almost never good for the people. </p>

<p>Maybe you should ask me why instead of assume?</p>

<p>If you asked me &quot;why&quot; then I would tell you this:</p>

<p><a href="https://i.redd.it/qn77m87po9r01.jpg">My take on Trump</a></p>

<p>Trump has been a Democrat before, grew up around them, but won the Presidency as a GOP. But I don&#39;t see him as either. I simply see the guy as a businessman who plays both sides of the ball in order to make things work.</p>

<p>Now, that image you saw, I think the same may have happened with Obama too. I thought he was a smart and intelligent changer, but nothing changed once he got into the Whitehouse.</p>

<p>Why? Because the scenario is this: Say you were running for Prez and ran on all the stuff we here LOVE, dismantle FED, break up the monopolies, go after the 1%, kick AIPAC/Israel out, and so forth right?</p>

<p>Well lets say you win, you walk into the Whitehouse on your first day, and all those guys in the image walk into the room and point their guns at you (symbolic), and what do you do? lol</p>

<p>If you want to tell Zionists to fuck off and kick them out, they can collapse the U.S. because of Bankster ownership, so you can&#39;t.</p>

<p>If you want to pull out of the Saudi Arabian Petro Dollar and tell the Saudis to fuck off, you can&#39;t because they own a shit ton of our debt and they can collapse the US Dollar/Economy by no longer using the petro dollar for buying/selling oil.</p>

<p>You want to tell the Globalists to Fuck off? You can&#39;t because they will create dossiers, they will bring out women to say you did stuff to them, or they will just outright JFK you if you dont play by the rules.</p>

<p>You want to get the pedophilia and rapes out of Hollywood? They will just get their top stars to turn everyone against you.</p>

<p>Ad infinitum.</p>

<p>Honestly Trump not signing the Paris Agreement while everyone else in the world did and while the world was looking at him, a globalist agreement designed to steal more money from the U.S., that was the biggest fuck you to the controllers and operators who run the globe. </p>

<p>Plus we have already signed and funded something previously so why do 2:</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_Climate_Fund">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_Climate_Fund</a></p>

<p>On top of this he said &quot;fuck off&quot; to the T.P.P. and we may reach 4% gdp this year which is fucking unheard of in the Economic sector analysts.</p>

<p>So you can hope the best for the guy in charge, and hope that he makes moves to get us closer to dismantling the FED, globalism, Hollywood, etc, but that doesn&#39;t mean you are GOP or DNC fuccboi </p>

<p>Wait til 2024, we wil see much dirtier shit from both sides in that campaign and in various ways before then as well.</p>

<p>The Obama sent spy into Trump&#39;s campaign will certainly ruin his false legacy, but at the end of the day, I think the shadow gov 7th floor fuckers will just snipe him anyway, so they can return to the Manchurian liberal takeover.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Novichok: nerve agent produced at only one site in Russia, says expert</strong></p>

<p>Bretton-Gordon, a former commander of the now disbanded UK Chemical, Biological, Radiation and Nuclear regiment and its Nato equivalent, said Shikhany was the sole location for development and production of novichok, dismissing suggestions that the chemical could be found in other places in the former Soviet Union such as Ukraine and Uzbekistan. “They have no more anywhere else,” he said.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I mean, I agree that the post title is <em>technically</em> incorrect, the media worked very hard to give off the idea that it could only be found in Russia. &quot;Blatantly false&quot; typically doesn&#39;t refer to semantic arguments. </p>

<p>Do you disagree with the fact that the media pushed the idea that it could ONLY be Russia <em>very hard</em> in the immediate aftermath of that assassination? They wanted to blame Russia reeeeeally badly, and were willing to intentionally mislead the public in order to do so. The fact that May never <em>technically</em> used the word &quot;only&quot; does not count as grounds for removal of that article IMO.</p>

<p>But I can certainly see your argument for why it should. That being said, in no way is that proof of said mod being a &quot;creepy Trump mod&quot;. In fact, you just gave a perfect example of users (such as yourself), unfairly accusing ANYONE who dares to go against whatever the MSM narrative is that day, as somehow automatically &quot;pro-Trump&quot;.</p>

<p>Really is fascinating to watch.</p>

<p>Lol Q is the definition of a conspiracy theory. Discussing it in a sub for conspiracy theories should surprise absolutely nobody. Whether it&#39;s true or not is irrelevant.

<p>Many people here seem to equate not being pro-Trump with being anti-Trump. Many people come to Trump&#39;s defense every time someone says something negative about him. </p>

<p>I&#39;m just not buying the main stream media&#39;s narrative that only one side did these things and benefited from these actions.

Both sides - all sides and everywhere in between - use these same techniques.</p>

<p>I hear all the time how CNN and MSNBC are these bastions of left-wing thought but that is pure bullshit; sure they are not warhawks and they are fairly inclusive regarding social issues but they are still ginormous globalist corporations who are <strong>never going to air</strong> pieces that push laborers for more power or talk about how bad wealth inequality really is.</p>

<p>So the unfortunate reality is that <em>both parties</em> are center-right and right wing parties when it comes to economics and when push comes to shove we&#39;ve had three Presidents work with foreign powers prior to their election...what do they have in common?</p>

The Sinclair video was hilarious and kind of sad, but it&#39;s clear that Leftist media has been targeting Sinclair for years now (See: John Oliver&#39;s video on Sinclair). It&#39;s literally a civil war between the &quot;Big 4&quot; networks and they don&#39;t want another group getting a piece of the pie.</p>

<p>Cambridge Analytica is similar. The scandal was manufactured in a London boardroom almost the second that the Russian scandal was deemed to hold no water. Without missing a beat, we now know it wasn&#39;t the Russians, but muh evil Facebook that was involved. Forget that Soros warned Facebook was &quot;going down&quot; a month earlier, or that Wellcome Foundation LTD, an EMPLOYER of Channel 4&#39;s head anchor John Snow, sold off thousands of stock in the lead up to the scandal. </p>

<p>Can you point to the &quot;left&quot; media doing the same thing?</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>I honestly don&#39;t get how people are so convinced that the russian investigation has been shown to be nothing. First and foremost, <em>it is still going on,</em> but also importantly it has led to 20+ indictments, multiple guilty pleas and jail time.</p>

<p>Will it pan out to be nothing more than this? Maybe, but it seems like you are spouting some talking point if you believe that it has already been &quot;deemed to hold no water&quot; when the bucket clearly already has water in it and we aren&#39;t even done potentially filling it yet.</p>

<p>The Sinclair video was hilarious and kind of sad, but it&#39;s clear that Leftist media has been targeting Sinclair for years now</p>

<p>Can you point to the &quot;left&quot; media doing the same thing?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The scandal was manufactured in a London boardroom almost the second that the Russian scandal was deemed to hold no water.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I honestly don&#39;t get how people are so convinced that the russian investigation has been shown to be nothing. First and foremost, <em>it is still going on,</em> but also importantly it has led to 20+ indictments, multiple guilty pleas and jail time.</p>

<p>Will it pan out to be nothing more than this? Maybe, but it seems like you are spouting some talking point if you believe that it has already been &quot;deemed to hold no water&quot; when the bucket clearly already has water in it and we aren&#39;t even done potentially filling it yet.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The racism is subtle until you see it.    Then when you see it, shit gets ugly and you see it everywhere.  A good place to start is in the left-wing reactions to Kanye and Candace Owens.  If you agree that Kanye and Candace are some sort of &quot;Uncle Tom&quot; then guess what you are part of the problem.</p>

<p>The idea that black people need to vote a certain way because of their skin color is wildly racist.</p>

<p>Minority scapegoating is also subtle.  Best starting point is to consider the default assumption that blacks are the ones deserving goverment support and by default are the ones penalized under drug laws.  Drug laws supported by both sides, but certainly including Democrats.</p>

<p>Sexism...many approaches to this one.  Misandry is of course sexism, but we have a few examples of liberal journalists saying that women assaulted by Democratic icons such as Harvey Weinstein should stay silent in order not to damage the Democratic party.  That&#39;s pretty ugly sexism if you ask me.</p>

<p>Conspiracy theories...muh Russia should suffice here.</p>

<p>Attacks on institutions...depends how you define institutions.  Consider that Christian churches are institutions.  Now consider the question again.</p>

<p>I&#39;m sure you&#39;ll disagree with everything I said and yes I post on T_D in case anyone was wondering.</p>
