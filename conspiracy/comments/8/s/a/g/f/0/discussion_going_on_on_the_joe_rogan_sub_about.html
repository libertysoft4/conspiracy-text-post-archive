<p>Possibly because I&#39;m indifferent to human relations, but I write this off as casualties of Truth. I really won&#39;t tolerate people who shut their ears to such matters, who won&#39;t even entertain it, who get all bent out of shape just because their belief system is being challenged.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Either someone has tapped him on the shoulder or its a conscious effort purely for his own personal commercial reasons.</p>

<p>Some of the episodes with Edgy Brah almost come across like interventions. When the topic turns to chemtrails and the lack of a single photographic  image of earth being available, Joe can&#39;t call &#39;bullshit&#39; quicker if he tried.</p>

<p>Funny thing is in regards to chemtrails there&#39;s now &#39;operation solar shield&#39;, so his wrong there. And his first port of call to debunk the lack of photos of Earth is to claim the Japanese Himawari-8 satellite takes a picture of Earth every 10mins. Again his totally wrong. The image/animation used is the Photoshop/cgi composite known as &#39;the blue marble earth&#39; which they then overlay with the relevant cloud cover. If you look in the websites ftp files under the &#39;site description&#39; folder it clearly states they use the nasa blue marble image.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t know if it even is being covered up mate. Ive been indoctrinated via school etc to believe in the globe earth though the past few years I&#39;ve watched various video&#39;s about the flat earth. They make some good points re. curvature seen-not seen/aeroplane instruments staying level etc.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not one that would ridicule anyone who&#39;s adamant the earth is flat. I simply dont know myself and truth be told it&#39;s not a particular topic or issue that bothers me. Partly because I&#39;m too stupid to get my head around the whole gravity, atmosphere, etc type of thing. It just doesn&#39;t compute to me how we cant sit in a balloon x meters above the earth and wait for the earths rotation before coming back down and ending up miles away from home. The earth spinning at x kmph, the axis, the moons etc it just goes over my head!</p>

<p>I must admit being downunder it sure doesn&#39;t feel like im upside down! </p>

<p>The conspiracy for me is does Eric Dubays voice make anyone else feel sick after a while?! I literally can only handle 15min of him talking before i have to turn it off. Bizarre. </p>

She does not look black, the mixup is completely understandable. 2. She does look like she’s from planet of the apes, look at that hair cut. This was one of the biggest media over reactions ever. Roseanne wasn’t even thinking about race when she said that. </p>

<p>Amazing how easy it is becoming to shape and sway opinions. We all use the same tools and they don&#39;t seem to be balanced. Maybe he is a crackpot but I should be able to form my own opinion on what he says.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve communicated with him via email and this guy just goes about his business, really doing this for the truth and nothing else.
