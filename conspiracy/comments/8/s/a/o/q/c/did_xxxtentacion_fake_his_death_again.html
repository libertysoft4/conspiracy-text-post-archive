        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p><strong>Possible proof that the Crime scene was staged and that X faked his own death. (This wouldn&#39;t be the first time x faked his death) I&#39;ll include pics + vid links.</strong> </p>

<p>While watching the footage of the crime scene something stood out to me that I thought was weird. (Image #1) In this pic you can see x in the driveaway and it appears that he was leaving the scene when he got shot. But if you look behind the car - the gates are closed. Why is the gate closed? Even more strange is the fact that These gates open inward. Meaning, because X&#39;s car is in the way, it wouldn&#39;t be physically possible to close the gates. Heres a pic from google maps with how the gates look when they are open. (Image #2) This would mean that in order for X&#39;s car to get in that driveway, the only way he would be able to do so is by reversing into the driveway from the street. </p>

<p><a href="https://imgur.com/a/ePEtpsa">https://imgur.com/a/ePEtpsa</a></p>

<p>Also some more sus things: </p>

<p>Video 2- No visible blood or wound</p>

<p>Video 2- X flinches when the man checks his pulse in video</p>

<p>Video 3- Outfit change? (someone removes his pants?)</p>

<p>----------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

<p>Youtube links</p>

<p>Video 1: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pj4FQ-mXSQY">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pj4FQ-mXSQY</a> </p>

<p>Video 2: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7Ff99WFA3w">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7Ff99WFA3w</a></p>

<p>Video 3: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wEch_rPsBzQ">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wEch_rPsBzQ</a></p>

<p>-----------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

<p>So there could be a chance X&#39;s car was far enough away from the gate that they were able to close it. (idk how likely that is.. it looks like too close a fit to me) </p>

<p>As for the blood: Maybe the blood is on his right side? (again seems unlikely to me that all the blood would be conveniently on the side that is hidden from camera)</p>

<p>X does flinch but he was pronounced dead at the hospital - not on the scene. (still the way the guy in the hoodie turns around as soon as x flinches it looks like he&#39;s making sure the camera Didn&#39;t see that, it looked like a &quot;oh shit we got caught&quot; kinda deal) </p>

<p>and as for his pants maybe someone took them off to get better access to wound. (Even though it would be hard cause you would have to lift x&#39;s body with one hand and pull his pants down with the other) </p>

<p>-----------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

<p>A witness at the scene did say the situation was &quot;Weird&quot; she also said that she heard 3 shots. </p>

<p>Too many things seem off. I think he&#39;s alive and faked his own death. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>we don&#39;t have any reports from the hospital. No one actually confirmed his death the sherif department said &quot;an adult male has been confirmed dead&quot; or something along those lines but not that it was actually X. I believe X has enough money to encourage a sherif officer to post a vague tweet.   </p>

<p>the gates definitely swings opens outwards/inwards towards where X&#39;s car would be </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Bullet wounds can be either very bloody or very little. Depends on the weapon, round, entry and potential exit wounds. If there is not an exit wound, bleeding is internal. His doors were probably not locked, struggle ensued hence being shot. Typically you do not move a wounded person unless you’re absolutely sure that movement will not further injure a person. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>But how does a bullet cause instant coma/death? I&#39;v never seen something like that - considering He wasn&#39;t shot in the brain or in the heart. From what I understand bleeding out can result in a coma but a witness saw the 2 gunman so the cops must have been notified as soon as the event took place. A witness heard 3 shots, if all 3 landed on X - I wouldn&#39;t call that a &quot;burglary&quot; - even if they took the bag.. which again idk how a witness would be able to identify it. Even though its a well known brand what are the odds that a random person is going to know a loui vuitonn bag when they see one </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Depends on where he was hit and with what. Carotid artery takes a hit, blood pressure will instantly drop and cause unconsciousness in seconds. Liver hit and it can be fairly quick. Lung, collapses and airway can obstruct. Many ways it can be fast and fatal without hitting head or heart. The body can shutdown very quickly. Depends on the person. He was very small from what i understand. Louis V bags are very descriptive with oversized logos everywhere on nearly every model. Easy to identify. So when police are told he had that in his possession(investigator normal question: “did he/she have any bags or possessions that you can remember?”) and now its not located, you can assume it was taken. Especially a camera at a bank showing he had that bag. After reviewing what is known so far, robbery gone bad is a pretty good assumption. This guy probably tried to gangbang his way out of the robbery and the robbers werent impressed. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I heard he was shot in the Kidney? I&#39;m not sure if that would cause instant unconsciousness? As far as the bag I can&#39;t imagine a random person being able to identify the bag like that unless they were into fashion. also The police seemed to have a lot of information within minutes of the shooting. There was no way they could have done an investigation in the time that they got the call and dropped him off at the hospital and than RUSH to twitter to update the public. They seemed to have a lot of answers VERY fast that they couldn&#39;t have gotten from just a preliminary investigation. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You’d be surprised at how quick an investigation can develop. Average person in Broward County, a well off area, would recognize a LV bag. Also, its a fairly prominent status symbol across several cultural classes. Kidneys shot would mean massive internal bleeding, which is where blood pressure crashes and you go unconscious quickly. Keep in mind I’m giving possible answers well within reason and not concrete ones. There is definitely room to question and explore but it can be erred on the side of normal day gone wrong rather than conspiratorial.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Also it was reported that this was a burglary and that a louis vuiton bag was stolen . How would they know this if XXX was in a coma/possibly dead?  if a witness reported that - oddly specific that they would know the brand of the bag that was stolen from several feet away.

    <div class="md"><p>Corroboration during investigation. For instance, several witnesses of his activities prior to the incident could each state there was a specific item like the bag. He apparently went to a bank prior to the dealership. This could be something as simple as the thieves trailing him from a place like a bank as a target of opportunity. Hard to take a car when you just shot the person driving it. Plus, witnesses began showing up quickly. And, a 8 series BMW is pretty easy to identify and track, even in Broward. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes I&#39;m positive. The pics on google maps are from 2017 - just several months ago.  This business has done a lot of work in a short amount of time leading up to X&#39;s &quot;Death&quot;. Maybe making the store camera ready? The satellite picture from above is current and you can see the markings on the ground confirm that it&#39;s the right gate.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t know anything about this case, XXX or even why so many people are posting in this sub about it - but the gates look nothing alike, aside from both being blue.</p>

<p>In the photo with his car, there are yellow lines and arrows, there&#39;s no sidewalk, the curb is gradual and there is no cement base at the gates.  The business may have done a lot of work, but those differences seem pretty big.</p>

<p>If this were a Highlights magazine, there&#39;d be at least 8 different things about the two gate photos.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>yes for some reason the owner did <strong>a lot</strong> of touching up in the short months leading up to this event. It&#39;s almost like he was getting the place &quot;<strong><em>camera ready</em></strong>&quot;. </p>

<p>Basically this is why the photos are so different: Google maps updates their &quot;street view&quot; database once a year typically, with those google cars with cameras on them. If you search the business on google maps ( 11995 SW 222nd St, Miami, FL 33170) and zoom all the way into street view - you will see the 2017 watermarks on the image. This made it really hard for me to confirm that it was the right gate - because so much has been updated/cleaned up around the property. </p>

<p>however If you zoom out and view the map from out of &quot;street view&quot; - it will be a current image because this image doesn&#39;t come from google map street cars. It&#39; is instead a satellite image. On the satellite image you&#39;ll be able to see that it is infact the right gate. </p>

<p>Here are lyrics from the Phryme song Era from February of this year.</p>

<p>&quot;I pop the Ruger and pop the new some
The extra extensive extent we&#39;ve gone
To send you in witness protection
Exit with this throne
I can hit you niggas ex
Or I can get you niggas x
Or I can get you niggas XXXTentacion
Bitch we not the same thing, me I come from a different world
I flip you out yo&#39; frame like the wayne wayne, then hit ya girl
Run up bare-faced broad day, the fuck I&#39;ma wrestle for
Leave your ass on heavens staircase touched at the chapel door&quot;</p>

<p>Sorry for the odd format I just c/p from the lyrics page.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was at the spot he was supposedly shot yesterday, I was born and raised down the street. Something is definitely up. Also when I was there I noticed a camera at the top of the building pointing directly to the exit of the gate where his car was stopped. I don’t know if it’s that detectives need more time to investigate footage, tips (sheriffs office told me they’re getting dozens of calls about possible suspects), etc., but they definitely know something and hopefully they either release it or go through with the investigation.</p>
