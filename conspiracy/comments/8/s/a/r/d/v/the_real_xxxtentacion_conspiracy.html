        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I am writing this on mobile so forgive me if the formatting is wrong. </p>

<p>Okay so since I have been seeing the same posts about XXXtentacion over and over I am going to make an actual thread with legit evidence/motive. I have been a fan of his music and followed him for the past couple years, and throughout his career I have always had a feeling something may happen to him.</p>

<p>First off, let’s start with the accusations. We have all heard the accusations against him, so I am not going to go into detail. A quick google search will inform you. Sometime after these accusations, a phone call was recorded showing the accuser to be admitting to have lied about them. Believe that or not, that isn’t really the main point of this post. But what it does bring me to is this thought.</p>

<p>The way that the media has handled XXX throughout his career reminds me of how Trump is treated by MSM. Constant smear articles, over and over to the point where it’s pretty clear that there is a push for this narrative. Even after his death, the Washington Post has compared him to both Roman Polanski and Woody Allen in their article about him. Again, I understand the accusations he was under, but I have never seen such an extreme assassination of character as you may call it, for an artist like this. </p>

<p>Although XXX was painted out to be a bad guy, any fan of his knows in reality that seems to be the exact opposite. I only ever saw videos/posts of him talking about self empowerment, overall positivity, being yourself, and basically breaking free from the matrix.  He also frequently talked about astral projection on instagram. These positive posts started to be the only thing I ever saw from him, and he really started to take on a sort of Tupac-esque role in my opinion. I remember thinking to myself that I couldn’t believe someone was getting away with saying all of this constantly, as this is the exact type of person that TPTB/Illuminati/whatever you want to call them would target. </p>

<p>Now let’s get to the symbolism. As we know, he died on 6/18/18. 18 is 6 x 3, or 6, 6, and 6. The name “XXXtentacion” itself can even be seen as a wordplay on “666 temptation”, as x is the 24th letter of the alphabet and 2+4=6. To make it even weirder, the gematria of his full name (Jahseh Dwayne Onfroy) is 216, which is 6 cubed, or 6 x 6 x 6. The official address of the site that he was reported dead at is 3671 North Dixie Highway. 3+6+7+1=17, and 17 was the name of XXX’s album and a tattoo he had on his forehead, which he always just referred to as “his number” (I don’t believe he ever elaborated on why). </p>

<p>In addition to the numerology, another thing to note is that XXX had a giant tattoo of an elephant covering his neck. Why is that important? Well yesterday, around the time of death, Michael Jackson’s ELEPHANT escaped from a zoo in Florida, XXX’s home state and place of death. Michael Jackson, another victim of these “powers that be”, had just gotten out of his contract before his death, just as XXX had with Capitol recently. The elephant was reported missing for exactly 20 minutes. XXX was 20 years old. Quite the coincidence. </p>

<p>As reported in other threads and visible on YouTube videos, XXX spoke of “sacrifice” on multiple occasions, including one apparently filmed hours before his death. This is not the first time sacrifice has been mentioned, as his best friend/former best friend as they were not on the best of terms recently (rapper Ski mask the slump god) said that XXX told him he was supposed to “sacrifice him”, which was part of the reason they basically cut ties. Another thing to note.</p>

<p>Now as far as the Drake stuff goes. We’ve seen the lyrics from “I’m upset” and “look alive”. I believe there is a valid meaning in those. XXX posted a photo fairly recently that looked like Drake was literally performing oral sex on another man, which he quickly deleted. XXX also said that “if anyone kills him it’s drake” in another quickly deleted Instagram post. As far as the whole pusha t beef goes, I do not know if XXX was the one that gave pusha the information. The beef may possibly not even have a direct connection but obviously is something to take into consideration. </p>

<p>The current suspects they have (rappers Soldier Kidd and Soldier Jojo) I honestly believe are being both set up and just using the old “any publicity is good publicity” approach to promote their own music. As much as the current evidence points to them something just seems too fishy about it. The red mask (which is the exact same model as the one XXX wore at an awards ceremony) and everything about their whole “xxx” image they have, plus the fact that they are up and coming rappers who would love the publicity, would be the perfect fall guys. I’m obviously no expert but I went on Instagram to watch Soldier Kidd’s live story right after and I personally thought that his body language made him seem innocent, not to mention he kept mentioning that he was being set up. </p>

<p>This whole situation has so many parallels to the murder of Tupac in my opinion, even down to the fact that they were both shot in a BMW. Tupac’s birthday also happened to be 2 days ago. Neptune retrograde was supposed to have started yesterday as well, and one of the characteristics of the planet Neptune is “self sacrifice”. </p>

<p>Looking on twitter yesterday, I found a lot of accounts posting about him basically just glamorizing his death and posting how happy they are that he’s died, but the weird thing is is that all the accounts basically look the same/have the same theme, they are ALL at 1k followers and are ALL only following around 40-60 people. Definitely fishy and reminiscent of bots. </p>

<p>Another thing to mention, and this is full conspiracy territory, is his location. X showed a lot of support towards the victims (or “victims” as some may say) of the recent infamous shooting in that area. Don’t want to get flagged by posting the name of the school. He said he lived within miles of the area. If this shooting was in fact a hoax as many claim, there has to be a reason why they pick that specific school, it isn’t just a random choice. Also keep in mind that this entire new scene of “SoundCloud rap” all comes from the same area. They are all basically friends and grew up around each other. For those familiar with Dave McGowan’s work, this sounds suspiciously familiar to the laurel canyon scene of the 60’s. Seeing how much time has passed, it’s not too far fetched to assume “they” have gotten smarter, wiser, and better at the counterculture manipulation. A lot seems to be going down in this area, including the large nightclub shooting last year, even going as far back as bands like *NSYNC and Backstreet Boys being formed in orlando. The amount of suspicious activity in this area reminds me of the recent influx of Arizona news.</p>

<p>This Snapchat posted by XXX on April 29th, 2017 and quickly deleted was what really got me first thinking about all of this. I will link an imgur image because I am writing this on mobile. It’s a pic of a screenshot from my old phone, hence why the photo looks like that. I remember someone from this subreddit actually posting about it when XXX first posted it but I went to look and it has since been deleted. </p>

<p><a href="http://imgur.com/MA9TxCF">http://imgur.com/MA9TxCF</a></p>

<p>I think we all know what happens to people that speak out about this. </p>

<p>I have also heard the theories that he faked his death to get out of his court case/pending charges, etc. I’m not gonna deny that theory either, any theory should be entertained and examined. Something is clearly up with this strange case.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>For you to even be open to theories is one step above everyone else, showing you are actually capable of thinking for yourself, unlike most of the people that are examining this. I would suggest that you look into the Laurel Canyon music scene of the 60s, specifically the work of Dave McGowan. It really makes you wonder what they could be capable of now. Let’s not forget to mention that the other rappers of the scene are constantly rapping about popping pills, sipping lean, etc making the pharmaceutical industry money. While XXX did have some lyrics referring to that, as a person he was never talking about that stuff and basically only ever trying to talk about self empowerment and positivity. I know the “old heads” get pissed at this comparison but he really did embody the Tupac archetype </p>

Witnesses stated it was men a red masks, they posted a picture of them on a car with a red mask hanging off the head rest on the seat. yesterday night they stated they had a new Album dropping at midnight titled XXX. </p>

<p>Drake isn&#39;t new to getting dead bodies for his come up, or for others. The artist&#39;s IG is @soldier.kidd. He was at 52k followers lastnight. He is now at 300k. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Apparently, Soldier Kidd and Soldier Jojo did it. There&#39;s an IG photo of his tweets saying they did shoot up X and what&#39;s more interesting is that he deactivated his twitter after. Will post the pic when I get out of class later, am on mobile</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Soldier Kidd&#39;s account on IG was hacked by an X fan. If police don&#39;t look into this they&#39;re covering up. Which wouldn&#39;t be a surprise. </p>

<p>I&#39;m wondering if they&#39;re were supposed to get caught. Like it helps they&#39;re rank or something. Also, last night one of Solider kids songs was put on WorldStar...</p>

<p>All this speaks volumes. Drake is a very dark individual. His best friend was shot and killed a few months ago at exactly 3 am. Fuckery. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>There’s definitely some sketch stuff surrounding his death although I think all the number stuff you are talking about is a bit overboard. Soldier kid posted a tweet that said he “just popped X for the clout” or something along those lines and then he deleted it. That’s when he posted the insta story saying it wasn’t him</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree that the numerology could be seen as overboard, however with coincidences like that I had to include it. Take something like the JFK assassination for example, where everything mattered even down to the street names and there was extreme symbology at play. If this in fact was done by the same type of group that was behind that, these people are huge occultists and symbolism is everything to them. Even something like the red mask they keep referring to. Wasn’t Kate Spade just found with a red scarf? These may truly all be coincidences but in a case like this where something is clearly not right, ALL aspects and theories have to be considered </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I never liked X’s music or anything but his death is extremely strange. I didn’t know him and Drake had some sort of beef which strange for me because I spend a lot of time on music boards. Maybe Drake hired these two unknown rappers to kill X because X had evidence of Drake being gay.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>They first had beef last year when Drake supposedly stole X’s look at me flow on his song “KMT”. Drake apparently claimed he had no idea who X was but X said that was a lie because drake had reached out to someone in his camp previously. X was actually basically the bigger man and pretty much just said he wanted to only be positive so the beef was “squashed”. Then the supposed pic X posted of drake months later. Keep in mind though that drake doesn’t even necessarily have to be gay. A lot of these stars, even someone as big as drake, are used and abused by their label forced into doing some pretty fucked up stuff for blackmail purposes, and something like that (including a pic being taken) done for the purpose of some sort of leverage or blackmail is not too far fetched. As for how X got the picture, that is a whole other mystery in itself. Drake, or someone/group/agency/etc. could have very well hired these two kids as well, although I truly believe they are being set up. But anything needs to be considered, because obviously what we are being told is extremely suspicious </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Interesting post and definitely his death has so many question marks surrounding it. </p>

<p>BTW here&#39;s an instagram post on the pics and videos suggesting that Drake is gay: <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BkMOnz0BIxZ/">WTF Drake?!</a></p>

<p>Also, for those interested in hip hop conspiracies and how the musical industry is just a social engineering operation, I highly recommend reading and listening to Mark Devlin. He breaks down how the nation of islam, 5 percenter, etc. control the scene, and how Wu-tang, etc. might be brainwashed puppets. Here&#39;s a link to two great podcasts on the subject that you might be interested in:</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thank you for posting this, I’m a big fan of Mark Devlin as well and would definitely recommend anyone to check out his podcasts and books. I definitely believe there is much social engineering is at play, and the fact that the majority of this “SoundCloud rap” scene has all originated from the same small area raises a huge red flag in my opinion once you are familiar with the work of someone like Mark. </p>
