<p>Space is literally infinite. Which means that an invading alien could be literally ANYTHING your mind can think of. Why does it have to be space ships, or flying saucers or stupid triangles? </p>

<p>What are the chances of “aliens” invading that have similar looking physical features and aircraft as portrayed in movies? To me it is a pretty lucky guess if a spaceship does invade us. </p>

<p>Why can’t the alien invasion be monstrous butterflies that live in space? Or a species formed from a gas or something (ghastly lol). Or a robotic sled of dogs. Or a sentient meteor? </p>

<p>So I feel a spaceship invasion if it were to happen would be fake as fuck right?? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It’s funny most blue bean believers think there aren’t aliens because “god”. Things have been flying around way before a supposed blue beam was set up. UFO’s are a phenomenon of themselves. Yes the gov took advantage of ufo reports to hide secret aircraft sometimes  but to think that’s it to the story is ridiculous. UFO’s are real. Are they aliens? It’s a high possibility. However until they walk out of the ship I’ll refrain. </p>

<p>There were also fairys, werwolves and gnomes around before bluebeam could have been set up, if you believe the written record.</p>

<p>What I&#39;m trying to express is, we can&#39;t know if the stories about UFO&#39;s from before that time had any more substance than the stories about all those fictional beings of that time.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t think project bluebeam will happen like assumed though.
There won&#39;t be any big attack or invasion. </p>

<p>Government only wants us to believe they are here. There will only be some more and more interesting sightings and more people will report being abducted by them. We will be given enough evidence to believe, but that&#39;s it.</p>

<p>Reason is, they have created all those fancy new technologies they could use to controll us, but they can&#39;t use them without people sometimes noticing that something weird is going on, so they need a scapegoat.</p>

<p>Not saying it&#39;s impossible aliens are visiting us, but all those sightings and the evidence we have? At least 99% delivered by government on purpose.</p>

<p>And who created the evidence to make you think that way?...</p>

<hr/>

<p>A comment of mine from two days ago:</p>

<p>Just ask yourself that one question and answer honestly.</p>

<p>When looking at how all this UFO hysteria begun in 1947, does it rather look like the government tried to coverup for an alien spacecraft crash or does it rather look like the government tried to make it look like they are covering up a crashed alien vehicle?</p>

<p>Seriously, it&#39;s as obvious as a woman in a miniskirt &quot;accidently&quot; droping a pencil and picking it up slowly...</p>

<p>&quot;No, we didn&#39;t call it flying saucer thing and later claimed it was just a weather ballon only to make you suspicious, we really thought it was something different and only later noticed it was only a weather ballon and all the secrecy later on wasn&#39;t to make you even more suspicious, it was just to... (I really accidently dropped that pencil...)</p>

<p>All the best evidence we ever got for aliens came straight from those people we always said are trying to keep it a secret. How come? It&#39;s ALWAYS some &quot;high ranked official&quot; spilling the beans, but they never get locked up or killed for telling us the &quot;secrets&quot; the government is trying SO HARD to hide from us...</p>

<hr/>

<p>The government always comes along like a child with a messy mouth full of chocolate that still claims it didn&#39;t steal the chocolate.. And we all go &quot;baaaah, the government is lieing, I can see it, there must be aliens since I can see they lie, it&#39;s obvious.&quot;</p>

<p>The government isn&#39;t as stupid as children are though, so we should wonder if they realy ate the chocolate or if they just try too fool us into thinking that.</p>

<p>If that were the case, then it would be a real invasion based on false pretense.  But it would still be an invasion.  If they want you to know about them and they are hostile, it&#39;s game over man.  </p>

I think TPTB are going to wait until they fully convince people they are in a simulation before allowing the paradigm to shift.

    <div class="md"><p>It appears to me to be very possible that if there is another intelligent civilization in the universe capable of reaching us, they would have some capacity for aggression against our species. I don&#39;t know if I&#39;d go so far as to say they&#39;d invade us-that wouldn&#39;t be the right terminology. Perhaps they&#39;d merely observe us for a time and then make a decision as to whether or not we deserve to exist, but it wouldn&#39;t resemble an invasion, it&#39;d be an extermination. We&#39;d be lucky if they decided to keep any of us alive.</p>

<p>In that sense, if we are invaded it will most certainly be fake, because no alien civilization would be primitive enough for their offensive to be classified as an invasion, and none would be naive enough to say, share their technology with us in such a way that would give us the capacity to defend ourselves in such a way that would allow their offensive to be classified as an invasion. No, I&#39;d imagine aliens would most likely do something like fly into the atmosphere and blast the planet with high frequency radiation that ruptures the cell membranes of all life on the surface of the earth, instantly killing our entire species.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yep. The children&#39;s-story level of anthropomorphism that goes into assuming aliens are anything like us physically (have physical, cohesive bodies, brains, think) or intellectually (give a rats ass about exploration of any kind as opposed to some other pressing pursuits that we can&#39;t even fathom because we don&#39;t come from there and didn&#39;t evolve there) is something i have lately realized. </p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>Space is literally infinite. Which means that an invading alien could be literally ANYTHING your mind can think of. Why does it have to be space ships, or flying saucers or stupid triangles?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Infinite space isn&#39;t quite the same thing as infinite possibility of everything occurring in the same infinite space.</p>

<p>It&#39;s a safe assumption that the laws of chemistry are uniform throughout the universe, even if the universe is actually infinite. So there aren&#39;t going to be e.g. any plutonium-based lifeforms. </p>

<p>Same goes for the laws of physics, although in fairness it has to be said that there is a lively debate going on about whether the laws of physics that we&#39;re familiar with are only &quot;localised&quot; (it&#39;s a completely hypothetical/philosophical argument, mind you, with no actual evidence to back it up.)</p>

<p>So the boring likelihood is that any space-faring intelligence will be pretty much the same as us. Walking meatsacks, travelling along inside a sealed capsule so they don&#39;t die in the vacuum of space.</p>

<p>On the other hand, an invasion by robots would make startling sense for a species intent on invading Earth. Better fighters, never get hungry or tired, and (more importantly) able to be sent very very long distances across space without needing to reproduce or consume very much. </p>

<p>A few advance starships full of robot soldiers would be the way any sensible black-hat ET would tackle a planet that s/he/it fancied depopulating and colonising.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If by some miracle of science I guess. You never know. It&#39;s true though.. we have literally no idea what to look for when it comes to alien life. All we have it to compare to is the life that evolved within the confines of earth. Even our intelligence and the way we think is ac product of life on earth so long for intelligence is just as difficult because all we know of it is what we have here on earth. Imagine life without the use of DNA as blueprints and instead something else altogether. It&#39;s not possible. We literally have no idea what to look for. Thats why it&#39;s ridiculous to even look for single celled organisms. That to is a product of the earth environment and history. </p>

<p>It would be a faked invasion and the most obvious answer to this question is so they could make themselves known. I am assuming they are dying to get selfies with our president in Times Square.</p>
