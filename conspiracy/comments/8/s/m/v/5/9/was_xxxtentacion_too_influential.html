    <div class="md"><p>Exactly but he was already gaining a lot of traction in the underground scene and would have been extremely influential to millions when his new album dropped .</p>

<p>They probably could spot this sort of thing, he had the potential to be kind of like the Tupac of this generation.</p>

<p>Regardless of his past, he had a way of communicating and speaking to people </p>

    <div class="md"><p>He wasn’t exactly “underground” an avg of over 100million streams on his top songs on Spotify kinda puts him more into the limelight. But he did have a certain way of relaying and conveying his message to the people that was beautiful. I wasn’t a huge fan until a little while ago but I was a huuuggge fan of lil peep before he passed and I feel they were very comparable in a lot of ways except X got shot and Peep OD’d. Both of those artists were doing amazing things changing the game with so many different things they were doing. They were pushing all boundaries on hip pop / rap / punk / alternative. Making music for the outcasts or people who feel different and can’t fit in. All in all. A great was lost which is truly a shame. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is an ok video on the subject but only goes into a bit about his &quot;death.&quot; MJ always discussed faking his death and mentioned it numerous times, the picture of him being put into the ambulance is a retouched pic of him from the 80&#39;s after his hair caught fire, his death certificate was not signed by his dr., there was no body on the stretcher taken into the hospital, there is footage of a similar looking disguised male being ushered into the hospital, etc. Look into it as there is far more evidence that he faked his death than that he actually died.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So were the reports of him abusing his woman false? Never heard of him until he died. </p>

<p>He just seemed like a seriously misguided individual. Preaching anti govt at your concert isn&#39;t grounds for killing him, there are plenty of rappers that do that.</p>

<p>Just seems like a reach.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No I’m pretty sure those allegations are true which is the primary argument against him. But my rebuttable yo that would be (and don’t think I’m standing up for DV here because I’m not) but he’s a 17 year old kid at the time obviously very troubled and he did something none of us should ever do but are you really going to hold that one thing against him as w mean to hate him? I mean shit we probably meet 20+ people a day with DV charges against them and we never know. It’s just because he has been in the spotlight and all of his mistakes get pushed into the front page. He was young dumb and obviously didn’t have the best decision making skills but none of those are grounds for him to be killed. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well I never said I hated him for it. I just said what he&#39;s preaching isn&#39;t grounds for some conspiracy killing of him.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know how this dude lived his life day to day I literally just heard of his existence yesterday (which leads me to believe he wasn&#39;t as popular/influential as some people say). Yet the fact that he&#39;s young, dumb, somewhat rich and popular as he was is more likely the reason he ended up dead. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Is it tho? If you believe that then you don’t belong in America where speech is free and if you believe that then how do you feel about every other artist. How did you feel about Eminem when he came out with that colombine line? I mean what you just said was absolutely insane. Someone should be murdered over their rap lyrics? Isn’t everyone entitled to say what they want it doesn’t have to appease anyone or everyone. Yeesh this is what’s wrong with America. </p>

<p>He wasn&#39;t saying that in a lyric. He was technically making threats to anyone. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I will say that of the current soundcloud rap generation 2016- now he was by far the most legitimately talented. He had a lot more passion and thought and creativity put into his music than any of these other young soundcloud rappers out now. Most of the other &#39;artists&#39; from this sub genre are basically just ironic jokes. They just operate based on the idea that if they get face tatoos or look crazy or do and say effiminate ironic shit that rap isnt traditionally known for, they can get attention and be successful. They mumble lyrics that dont rhyme and have very little substance or originality or talent. Unfortunately this has proven to be a formula for success. </p>

<p>Rap used to be about releasing aggression, and intimidating lyrics. It was always a genre that operated on the principle of shock, but it was usually the shock of people being violent or dangerous. Now its just devolved into a literal freak show.</p>

<p>X had some of the same freak show elements, but there was genuine talent, genuine passion and genuine substance in his music that just doesnt exist in most rap today.</p>

<p>All that being said, I have to admit i&#39;m not very familiar with his music, but I dont personally think he was a threat to the establishment. If anything he was a useful tool of the establishment to promote the fantasy of achieving material wealth through being a rapper. Just the fact that rappers exist and can get rich creates an illusion and a fantasy that could serve as a useful distraction.</p>

<p>Again, not knowing much about his music, I cant say if he was trying to enlighten or expose the system, but I can say whether he was or not, it was his own carelessness and running his mouth too much that likely got him killed.</p>

<p>I know he was only 20, but why would you be rolling in an $80,000 car with $100,000 in a louis viton bag, especially when you have a number one album, are well known, and even worse, you have gained a lot of attention for talking a lot of reckless inflammatory shit about a A LOT of potentially dangerous and people, and even threatened peoples lives on instagram and twitter? &quot;dont come to broward&quot;</p>

<p>I get it, controversy sells, and a lot of it may have been an act, but if you make your money in an industry that is known for promoting violence and criminality, and is known for doing business with shady underworld figures who finance rappers careers often through drug sales, why would you be so careless? If your basically a professional beef starter and shit talker, and thats how you earn your living, at a certain point you have to be able to back that up, or at least invest HEAVILY in security to insulate ourself from the possible dangers. At that point you are basically giving up your freedom to ride in your car alone. You just cant do it EVER.</p>

<p>Its not like jay leno riding around LA, &quot;oh theres jay leno.&quot; Even he has money and notoriety and could be potentially robbed, but he hasnt threatened peoples lives on social media, and he hasnt made himslef known for talking inflammatory shit about potentially dangerous people. Its a different ballgame of fame.</p>

<p>So I personally dont think he was taken out by the powers that be for exposing the system. I think he was a naive reckless young kid who had serious rage issues and ran his mouth WAY too much, and probably said the wrong thing, to, or about the wrong person, and then failed to tactically secure his person.</p>

<p>Its a shame, but he cant be riding around with no security and lots of cash and not even just one friend in the car to help watch his back.</p>

I don&#39;t know if you have seen the conspiracy posts accusing Soldier Kidd, another Florida rapper, of mudering X. Also someone pointed out that in some of the witness videos, his pants are different colors, one red, and one black. Also I can&#39;t make out his face tats. I&#39;ll look for links, but I definitely think something is up. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>He actually had a much larger influence then you might think. He had over 20 million page views for his lyrics on genius.com (5th of any artist in 2017), his album &quot;?&quot; was number 5 on billboard top 100 for 3 weeks, had many top songs, and had well over 6 million instagram followers. X talked about the touchy subject of suicide and was even faulted for doing so after some of his music was taken off spotify. After this wave of adolescent suicides, even the netflix series 13 reasons why was pushed to be taken off from viewers eyes. X had no label, didnt fit any narrative for sure, talked about violence, and was even tried for a number or crimes. Being he was only 20 years old and had reached the level of success that he did and seemed to be miles apart from the other &quot;new age&quot; rappers... its possible he was taken out because people were scared he would be too strong in the future </p>
