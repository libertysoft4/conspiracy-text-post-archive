    <div class="md"><p>He did indeed. I believe that to be true after reading her detailed account of what happened. But you have to look at the entire person if your going to judge. He stabbed someone at 6 years old to defend his mom. He was blatantly bi polar and that’s even harder when depression is added on. I know people from the generation in front of mine will never fully understand the effects that the world changing has on young minds. He hasn’t had a negative headline in a year. So we can at least know he was trying to turn his shit around. But once a demon has entered a person metaphorically it’s shadow will always be there.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Before you mention the gay guy in jail I’d like to note that there are 50,000 cases of male rape in prison annually. And you know he probably did beat the shit out of her and her eye was fucked up. Guess what though. If Malcolm X died at 20 he would only be known as a women abuser, narcotic addict, and worse. If you died at 20 would you have done more good in the world or more bad? I’m not justifying his actions. But really he wasn’t THAT bad compared to other people who aren’t dead but also aren’t being boycotted right now</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I also bet you didn’t have a lot of psychological issues at 20. Or even now. Again man I’m not justifying his actions. But I like to note these things so instead of having a bunch of negative stories you also understand how it could’ve happened. His music was only the sad and motivational when he was on soundcloud(this is what I’m told I’m not a diehard X fan I have like 3 songs). And than when everyone started paying attention to his life his issues probably only got worse and he eventually decided to say fuck it I am an angry person. I say this because I relate to that on a level you can’t comprehend. And a lot of X’s other messages relate to a lot more of other young adults. That’s why I think we deserve the respect to talk about the actual controversy around his death</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No see that’s were this whole post is going over your head. Read the bio of THIS sub-Reddit. You’ll see this is indeed a conspiracy, you’ll see that this indeed is a sub Reddit were everyone can have an opinion. As I’ve already stated I have 3 songs of his downloaded and hardly listen to them in fact. This is just the topic on the internet right now. And I’m keeping up to date. My friends were diehard fans and I’ve shared some of their feelings combined with my own. The facts though....let’s seee... yup I can post here and I can post the XXXtentacion theories all I want. It’s within the rules of this sub Reddit and the rules of Reddit. Thanks for your input though.</p>

<li>This isn&#39;t a post about a conspiracy. 2. You can hate a person but enjoy their music, it&#39;s not hard to seperate a person from their art. 3. X is dead, there&#39;s no real conspiracy on the topic as it is. 4. Just like you have an opinion on X, so can other people, which defeats the point of this post in the first place. They&#39;re allowed to hate him if they want. 5. If you want to talk about X and it has nothing to do with a conspiracy, post about him in r/music or even better, r/hiphopheads, or join one of the many posts made about him in r/hhh. 6. As far as I saw in this post, no one is disrespecting you, just posting about their hate for him, which is allowed and quite honestly justified. 7. He was controversial, had beef with many people, and has beat the shit out of many more, him getting shot and killed shouldn&#39;t come to much of a surprise. I wouldn&#39;t go as far as to say he deserved it, but with the life he lived, he wasn&#39;t <em>not</em> asking for it</li>

Like I said previously, if you want to have more conversations about X, r/hiphopheads has tons of posts discussing him and don&#39;t have to contain a conspiracy and will allow you to share your thoughts more openly/less restrictive. Some subs will always have trolls, don&#39;t let&#39;em get to ya man. If they&#39;re disrespecting you by trying to tell you to take your posts down, just ignore them.

    <div class="md"><p>If you want people to listen and have an honest debate with you there’s a way to go about it and this isn’t the way. Before I start, this is nothing like Tupac. There’s still discussion on him, before reddit it was talked of frequently. Tupac leads me into this. The reason Tupac is considered a conspiracy is that he and biggie (among others) started a movement that reached far beyond music. That wasn’t seen as a good thing by those in political positions. When Tupac killed two cops he became a target. The rapper you’re talking about wasn’t near the level of conspiracy Tupac was and is. If you want people here to listen and talk about this, site the sources you’re reading this info from. Make your point without all the added drama, it just makes you look hostile and too far emotionally invested to make valid points. 
The difference between this sub and others on hot topics is you can find people who are less likely to  find people that are disrespectful to others opinions. So long as they come across with an attitude that’s enlightening and not demeaning. </p>
