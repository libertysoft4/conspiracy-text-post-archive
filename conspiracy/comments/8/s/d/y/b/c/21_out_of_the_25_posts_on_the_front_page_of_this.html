    <div class="md"><p>I think some of this people have a point when saying that sometimes there is too much content here that is just news. Yeah, sometimes political events are conspiracy related, but this isn&#39;t always the case.</p>

<p>Personally out of my own experience, instead of searching for news people should try to find cases of corruption going on that involve either politicians, organizations or corporations. Those cases aren&#39;t conspiracy theories, but rather factual conspiracies. These are usually my most upvoted posts.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So here&#39;s the thing. </p>

<p>Even before I went over there I knew there was going to be politics. Not just because the conspiracy &quot;movement&quot; has been co-opted by right wing political groups since at least WACO. But because Politics is just something that&#39;s going to happen when more then 2 people exist in the world. </p>

<p>The fact of the matter is that humans are a political creature and have been since we started living in groups. When you see something and you think &quot;awe, that&#39;s completely apolitical&quot; what&#39;s actually happening is that it just fits your politics. Whenever someone throws a fit about someone else &quot;putting politics in my  X&quot;  what they&#39;re really doing is protecting the status quo. It&#39;s kind of like the fact that you&#39;re eyes don&#39;t &quot;See&quot; your nose even through it&#39;s always there in plain sight. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Unerstood. But when rule 1 says &quot;no fucking politics&quot; then you would think it means just exactly that. The fact is that people are assholes. They will go onto a sub and spew their polital rhwtoric even when specifically told the sub and its users dont want it there. Some people think rules are not meant for them, or are so brainwashed with propoganda they cannot function without doing so. Either way, I was trying to support a sub because I like the concept and the one moderator made me look bad by doing so. Will not happen twice. Peace.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I enjoy conspiracy theories involving aliens, cryptids, mythos, and the unnatural/unexplained more than political as well. </p>

<p>That being said, some of the more political conspiracy theories have large implications and many people believe those theories will be on the level of WaterGate, so I can&#39;t blame people for wanting to talk about that stuff.</p>

<p>If you want more of the &quot;unexplained mysteries&quot; theories, participate in those threads. I&#39;m afraid, however, that politics will consume the hot tab for a while. </p>

<p>Discourse is easier to find there and a lot of people seem to be looking for discourse. Perhaps that&#39;s the goal, to keep people from talking about the actual theories, but I subscribe to the simplest answer is usually the right one and it&#39;s just people looking to discuss.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Politics is defined as: &quot;the activities associated with the governance of a country or other area, especially the debate or conflict among individuals or parties having or hoping to achieve power.&quot;</p>

<p>Conspiracy is defined as: &quot;a secret plan by a group to do something unlawful or harmful.&quot; </p>

<p>All conspiracies have connections to politics, because all conspiracies are about seizing power through unlawful or harmful plots. Maybe you mean to say that a lot of the posts on the front page are about &quot;partisan electoral politics&quot; or &quot;government politics&quot;, but all conspiracies are inherently political. And when politicians in government are constantly involved in conspiracies, cover-ups, criminality, what would you have us do? NOT talk about conspiracies involving governments or politicians just because you don&#39;t like it? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I probably shouldnt have picked on Bigfoot because I believe at one time I think something like a Bigfoot type creature may have existed. Maybe it was when humanity was young and we co-mingled or competed with other Homo species that were pretty different from us. As if are shared memory from long ago still remembers and stories of them have been brought down through the ages. I mean there still might be some holdovers out there that  remain hidden. I guess that is possible . But, I do know that is what brings a lot of us here.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yea but if this sub stuck more to it&#39;s roots and got more away from politics it would become less partisan because governments,in this country and others tend to hid info about Aliens/UFOs regardless of political party. If somebody tries to make it a partisan issue, they could be made to look ridiculous because if there is/was a cover-up of the phenomenon it would necessitate bipartisanship. That is definitively true in this country and any of  the western democracies anyway.</p>
