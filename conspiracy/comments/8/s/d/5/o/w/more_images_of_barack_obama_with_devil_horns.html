        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>So this image of <a href="https://i1.wp.com/www.dcclothesline.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/obama-as-baphomet.jpg?fit=500%2C3430">Artur Davis and Bathhouse Barry (sporting a fabulously camp Devil Horns outfit)</a> has caused a certain amount of controversy.</p>

<p>Although the provenance of the image is uncertain, a number of useful idiots are spluttering that the man in the costume is not Barack Obama at all, but another homosexual satanist called <a href="https://c1.staticflickr.com/1/418/20373777482_db3584bff3_b.jpg">Michel Madie</a> - pictured here wearing a similar, but  <a href="https://imgur.com/gallery/7qVsmju"><strong>different costume</strong></a> which was clearly taken at a <strong>different time</strong> and a <strong>different place</strong>. Furthermore, the man pictured with Artur Davis looks much more like Obama than Madie, and the desperate Obama apologists have also conveniently failed to explain why Artur Davis, <a href="http://freedomslighthouse.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/arturdavisbarackobama.jpg">who has been pictured many times with Obama</a>, would be in a picture standing with Michel Madie.</p>

<p>It&#39;s obviously Obama. Get over it.</p>

<p>Anyway, this is not the first instance of predictive programming where Obama has been pictured with horns. These pictures are genuine, but were stage managed to get the desired effect. Enjoy:</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s not proof. My argument is to counter the suggestion being made by some that this Michel Madie, because we are looking at a different costume, different time, different place to the Madie pictures taken at Burning Man. Furthermore, the eyes/eyebrows are much more like Obama&#39;s and Artur Davis&#39;s presence in the picture needs a plausible explanation from those arguing it isn&#39;t Obama.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Lol, good luck man.  The admins actually removed my <a href="https://imgur.com/gallery/akjg3zk">submission</a> statement to my post talking about this.</p>

<p>I just thought it was genuine conversation that there was a debunking thread that didn&#39;t debunk.  The masks are clearly different.  Anyway, it was rumored I was banned for the thread but I don&#39;t think I am unless I&#39;m shadowbanned.  </p>

<p>Regardless, why is everyone busting a nut on whether or not it Obama?  We know that the people that run the planet aren&#39;t what we think they are.  Everyone is freaking out about this subject.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I can&#39;t understand how people say that the original pic of what is thought to be Obama and Davis is this guy from burning man.  Take a clear look at the nose pieces to the costumes.  The nose piece is thread thin on the supposed Obama pic and the guy from burning man the nose piece is a few inches wide:</p>

<p><a href="https://imgur.com/gallery/7qVsmju">Differences in the costumes</a></p>

<p>I&#39;m not trying to be argumentative etc, love your posts and insight but I  can&#39;t understand why people are saying its the same costume.  On top of that the &quot;clone&quot; of [Artur Davis].(<a href="https://imgur.com/gallery/mPRqwxP">https://imgur.com/gallery/mPRqwxP</a>) beside him.</p>

<p>Personally I could care less and think this whole thing makes for some good discussion.  I know alot of the people in charge are not who they claim.  I don&#39;t understand the controversy that these pics have caused this sub.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re right. Hmm. That makes sense, they guy who I got the link from is a total shill. But at a glance, it got me. And I hate this subject, i&#39;m looking for any reason fir it to go away. I mean, being a devil worshipper doesn&#39;t make him any worse to me. He is involved in all the shitty things they all are. If anything, I would be unsurprised.</p>

<p>So, thanks for clearing that up, I&#39;ll fix my comment.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Awesome man.  This whole thing is weird.  They cannot prove it&#39;s been photoshopped because it wasn&#39;t so now they&#39;re jumping on this Michel dudes pics from Burning Man.  They&#39;re slamming anyone that posts evidence to the contrary.  The fact that someone that looks exactly like Artur Davis is standing with whoever is in the outfit is hard to dispute and is what made me so interested in the picture to begin with.  The weird responses and brigading to counter the evidence is telling.  Thanks man!  </p>
