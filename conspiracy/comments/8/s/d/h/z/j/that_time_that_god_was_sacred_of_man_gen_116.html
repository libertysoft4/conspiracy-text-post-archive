        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I always found the Tower of Babel especially interesting due to the apparent fear that God had of man working together while building a tower to reach the heavens. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Gen 11:6 (NIV) The Lord said, “If as one people speaking the same language they have begun to do this, then nothing they plan to do will be impossible for them. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>The immediate reaction from God is to confuse the languages and disperse the people. I know there is some dispute about Genesis being literal/figurative and when/if it stops being so.</p>

<p>Do any of you guys have any thoughts on this?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I’ll start off by saying that I am religious and I do believe in God. However, I believe the Bible as well as all religious texts, are nothing more than the writing and interpretations of man. The Bible even states that it is simply the inspired word of God. For this reason, I believe, it is more important to look at the stories as a whole and understand the meaning/teaching instead of focusing on the exact passages and wording. </p>

<p>What this has to do with your initial question, well I couldn’t exactly tell you. I do believe that all religious texts and teachings are inspired by the same God, but altered and written to fit the culture at the time. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Of course. The Pentateuch (first 5 books of the Old Testament) were written by one man, Moses. And as I mentioned there are a lot of theories about figurative story telling vs literal events. The gap theory is a good example of questions in the Genesis interpretation. </p>

<p>I just always found this example from he tower of babe interesting. What is it teaching us? The origin of different languages is due to God halting a construction project? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Read the last chapter of Deuteronomy.  It&#39;s quite obvious Moses didn&#39;t write that.  In fact if you read the 5 books it&#39;s clear that much of the writing was done by Joshua, who was Moses&#39; scribe and assistant.  But even then, we don&#39;t have manuscripts older than 500BC, and there&#39;s a strong theory that the present canon was largely assembled and edited during the Exile or shortly after, with some work done under Hezekiah.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, I personally think these books originate substantially from the time of the Exodus.</p>

All I said was that their inspiration from God could adapt to culture and circumstances of the hundreds of years the books were adapted in written.

<p>Genesis 11:7-9</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Come, let us go down and confuse their language so they will not understand each other.”</p>

<p>8 So the Lord scattered them from there over all the earth, and they stopped building the city. 9 That is why it was called Babel[c]—because there the Lord confused the language of the whole world. From there the Lord scattered them over the face of the whole earth.</p>

<p>As an aside....the use of the word &quot;Us&quot; poses some fun questions.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That has literally nothing to do with the language we speak. It comes down to common enemies in conflicts we’ve been involved in. By your logic we should have warred with Mexico in the past 100 years because they speak a different language. We have been allied due to common enemies and national goals. </p>

<p>You merely need to look at world history to see how often countries and/or territories that speak a common language have gone to war with each other due to land, resources, and other means. Similar language has rarely if ever stopped people from going to war with one another. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree with you that we face many barriers to unite as a species. However, I don’t think we will ever have a single language and even if we did, history shows that that wouldn’t stop conflict or wars.

    <div class="md"><p>I read and/or watched something saying that the old Hebrew word used in the Tower of Babel story can be translated as language, like how we speak, but can also mean mode or method of doing (closer to code-as-language or &quot;letter of the law&quot; than English, Spanish, etc).</p>

<p>That word, and heck if I remember some old Hebrew word, only shows up 2-4 more times in the OT, some small amount.  In each of those usages, the &quot;mode or method of doing&quot; was the meaning.  This means that if Babel used that word to mean &quot;language&quot; it would be unique in that way.</p>

<p>Most likely this story refers to a mode or method of doing that man had figured out.  Unlikely that it refers to an Esparanto-like global Common tongue, or even a regional Common tongue.</p>

<p>Babel is also Babyl, short for Babylon.  AKA the capital of Babylon, or at least the primary city, and also representing the system Babylon had erected.  That system was an usury-based monetary system with an elite/serf control system.</p>

<p>Also, I&#39;m not 100% the &quot;If as one people&quot; refers to all of mankind.  OT God is pretty direct in whom he speaks with.</p>

<p>My translation would be kinda like &quot;If this individual group of people organize their commerce and government as they have begun to do, then...&quot;</p>

<p>Or even more modern:  &quot;If they institute a Central Bank and charge usury, then it will suck for the rest of Man.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>In general, OT God is an angry fellow.</p>

<p>This specific instance called for intervention because debt-based monetary systems were not in OT God&#39;s plan.  OT God&#39;s plan seemed to want more direct worship of him and his creations, less attention to money.  </p>

<p>Example, Cain vs Abel:  Cain works the land, advancing and improving upon OT God&#39;s creation.  Abel merely cares for OT God&#39;s creation, the sheep.  Abel is rewarded by OT God, and Cain gets pissed and kills Abel.</p>

<p>It&#39;s basically the same story as Babel.  Cain (aka one people) creates agriculture (aka money), and OT God is displeased.</p>

<p>Anything that creates value outside OT God&#39;s creation is gonna suffer wrath.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>the issue with Cain and Abel is that Cain took his stand on the adequacy of his own works, which was an affront to God, while Abel took his stand on the adequacy of God&#39;s works. You see this attitude pretty consistently in the Old Testament: another example is how God instructed the Israelites to use only natural, uncut stones if they are to make an altar to him, saying that their using their own tools to shape the stones would defile the altar. <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Exodus+20%3A25&amp;amp;version=ESV">Exodus 20:25</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>this is pretty much the central premise of Christian belief. The story of Cain and Abel is a direct foreshadowing of the appearance of Christ. </p>

<p>Cain represents the Jews, the Israelites of old. These Jews thought themselves to please God with the sufficiency of their own religious labor, just as Cain thought himself to please God by offering the gift of his own agricultural labor. But just as God considered Cain&#39;s offering inadequate, God also considered the religious labor of the Jews inadequate. This speaks to the inferiority of man&#39;s works.</p>

<p>Abel chose instead to please God not with his own works, but with the gift of God&#39;s own unblemished lamb, who is Christ. This speaks to the superiority of God&#39;s works, and with this God is pleased. The contrast between Cain&#39;s offering and Abel&#39;s offering represents the contrast between the approach of the ancient Israelites, based in man&#39;s labor, and the approach of believers in Christ afterward, which is based in grace, where God has bestowed adequacy from himself unto mankind as a gift.</p>

<p>true to form, Cain murdered Abel, just as the Jews of the old covenant killed Christ and persecuted his believers afterward. It&#39;s a really potent bit of prophecy, I think, but it is concealed to all except those who are willing to pay attention to it.</p>

<p>thanks for reading.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Kinda long I apologize, but It wasn’t a fear.  The people of Babel were working against God and his commandment, which was that humanity go forth and multiply. He wanted people to extend out and take care of the earth gifted to us while giving praise. </p>

<p>People instead began to build the tower out of greed and personal gain, while attempting to reach same level of knowledge, and power as God. “Come let us build ourselves a city, and a tower who’s top will reach the heavens, let us make a name for ourselves, lest we be scattered abroad the face of the earth.” </p>

<p>This is where it gets interesting and you have to dive into the scripture. The people say they have to make a “name” for themselves; the Hebrew word for “name” is Shem, and Shem or the Shemites were the direct family bloodline that God chose to use, to help fulfill his prophecy on earth. </p>

<p>Now Nimrod the man who built the kingdom of Babylon was a descendant of Ham or the Hamites, who were cursed by God for incest. Nimrod had evil in his heart, encouraged sinning, and wanted to be worshiped by his people like a literal God. He built the tower to make a name or “Shem” for himself, making it a direct opposition to the shemites and God himself. </p>

<p>Satan’s main purpose is to establish a one world government (revelations) which worships him and denounces God. At this point in history it looks like Babylon was the devil’s best opportunity to fulfill this plan. </p>

<p>Think about it... everyone spoke the same language, and were gathered together in one place, they were like sitting ducks for Satan. God intervened and crossed languages scattering people so that the devil couldn’t bring this plan to fruition until it fit within the Lord’s plan. I really forgot just how interesting this story was haven’t read it in awhile good topic! </p>

<p>Or its the truth and not lucifarian or based out of Theosophy.</p>

<p>The demiurge theory goes way back before theosophy existed and has been brought up as a possibility in various cultures around the world.</p>

<p>I believe the god of the jews is false evil being, but that Jesus taught of a legit Source (true God of Love, joy, forgiveness) and one who does not order genocides, or get angry, or jealous, or whatever old testament ridiculousness the jews came up with</p>

<p>Not only that, but the God that Jesus teaches about, lines up with that of many other cultures around the world and with NDE reports in terms of being Love, Light, Source, Oneness, etc</p>

<p>How do you reconcile that with Jesus repeatedly referencing OT scripture?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Jews wouldn&#39;t budge if Jesus preached something new and outside the jewish B.S. so he had to link the new with the old, plus some of the stuff in the OT predicts the coming of Christ, but the jews think it will be some savior/profit that makes Israel the throne of the world and destroys all evil and anyone against the jews, instead of an enlightened Buddha type Neo from the Matrix savior who possibly kills karmic cycle/ties to the reincarnation prison if you follow Christ.</p>

<p>If you study history, this happens in most cultures where a new religion takes over an old one, the new borrows/links/connects some of the old into itself so more of the followers from the old have an easier transition.</p>

<p>If Jesus said, &quot;Leave Judaism and the evil demiurge genocidal bloodthirsty angry false being, and follow me so I can show you the true Source of all things which is Love,&quot; you wouldn&#39;t get as many people to leave the old into the new. Instead, they would still kill him and reject any and all the things he said/taught.</p>

<p>Whereas connecting to the old and showing the old predicted his coming and being more low key about the conspiracy and more based on Love and simplicity, then he would win more over and the teachings have a broader reach and easier to spread </p>

<p>But isn&#39;t that being dishonest on his part by suggesting the OT are inspired of God?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I dont think its dishonest. If you look at Psalms for example, the poetry there exudes a message of a loving God, Union, Oneness, Enlightenment, whereas the rest who really knows. The OT has dozens of authors, some of it allegorical, some of it record keeping genealogy, some of it poetry, some of it perhaps may be the author attributing human attributes to god unknowingly so, some of it mystical in nature.</p>

<p>Considering he only had 3 years to teach, and some of these things are deeply complex matters that have to do with transcendence, mystical states, bliss, ego death, nonduality, etc, then he would have known that to keep it simple, watered down, to reach as many people as possible is the best route to go.</p>

<p>In one verse he teaches ego death as the only way to heaven (Born again of water and spirit) and in another verse he tells the thief on the Cross who believes Jesus is legit, that his faith and belief will get him into heaven on the day after he passes.</p>

<p>So there is a lot of flexibility here in terms of modalities of teaching.</p>

<p>All that to say, that I dont think not telling the jews that their OT god is false being is dishonest. I just think its too big and too controversial and causes too much strife, hatred, confusion, etc to be useful in any way, especially when you consider the context of him speaking to a bunch of harded jews who mostly only believe animal sacrificed blood has to pour to a blood thirsty being to appease it for their sins (by slaughtering innocent animals)</p>

<p>So Jesus instead made it simple, i.e. stop doing the animal murder stuff, the 700 rules you have to follow, cutting you male babies foreskins off, and all the other useless stuff, and simply come follow me and these teachings based on love, ego death, entering into your heart where you treasure is</p>

    <div class="md"><p>we can agree to disagree of course. Anyhow, here&#39;s why a I think Jewish demiurge is false god:</p>

<p>In Judaism and sections of the Old Testament, there&#39;s a cover up going on, about YHWH&#39;s wife, Asherah.  Another link here that discusses more of this whole ordeal:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.seeker.com/gods-wife-edited-out-of-the-bible-almost-1766083399.html">https://www.seeker.com/gods-wife-edited-out-of-the-bible-almost-1766083399.html</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>God had a wife, Asherah, whom the Book of Kings suggests was worshiped alongside Yahweh in his temple in Israel, according to an Oxford scholar.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asherah">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asherah</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Asherah is identified as the queen consort of the Sumerian god Anu, and Ugaritic El,[1] the oldest deities of their respective pantheons,[2] as well as Yahweh, the god of Israel and Judah.[3] This role gave her a similarly high rank in the Ugaritic pantheon.[4] Despite her association with Yahweh in extra-biblical sources, Yahweh in the Bible commands the destruction of her shrines so as to maintain purity of worship to Yahweh Himself.[5] </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Great Vid on the Above and on jewish god being a false god here:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Uo2oAuXMUg">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Uo2oAuXMUg</a></p>

<p>If you study some NDE&#39;s there are people who go to the other side, and see Spirits as big as cities, as big as planets, and often times they confuse them as &quot;god&quot;, same deal with the Demiurge.</p>

<p>There&#39;s a brilliant NDE report of a man who met the false god and saw hundreds of millions worshiping it:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.trickedbythelight.com/tbtl/nde-transcript.html">http://www.trickedbythelight.com/tbtl/nde-transcript.html</a></p>

<p>Also the biggest evidence for this is the story about Buddha after his enlightenment, your consciousness is freed from the body and can travel and visit anywhere. So he starts mapping out the Spirit realms, and comes across a &quot;god&quot; who tells him he needs to worship him, and if he does he will be let into heaven, but if he doesn&#39;t he will go to hell. Buddha challenges him and wins the challenges, proving that this being is not god, but a false lower being who forgot its origins.</p>

<p>This false god basically has all the same orders to Buddha that are ordered to the jews:</p>

<p><a href="https://thedailyenlightenment.com/2012/03/the-buddhas-victory-over-a-god-demon/">https://thedailyenlightenment.com/2012/03/the-buddhas-victory-over-a-god-demon/</a></p>

<p>Edit* This is probably one of the biggest conspiracies that exist and it is often covered up, not well known, and when you talk about it, shills show up and try to argue that its not true.</p>

<p>Now hear me out. Maybe I&#39;m all wrong about this. Maybe the authors of OT just attributed bad stuff to a good God, but then that makes parts of the OT false. Its certainly a crazy thought exercise that has actually kept me up at night because of its ramifications. This to me is the biggest conspiracy ever</p>

<p>Or he&#39;s jealous because he knows he false and there is a source above. Or like the god&#39;s of the greeks, its a being that exists and is sustained by the energy produced by love and worship</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The definition is immediate influence by God. I never said the authors weren’t. All I said was that their inspiration from God could adapt to culture and circumstances of the hundreds of years the books were adapted in written. The Bible and all other religious texts have been transcribed and copied for millennia. To say that there was no adaptation over that time is naive. </p>

<p>But isn&#39;t that being dishonest on his part by suggesting the OT are inspired of God?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I dont think its dishonest. If you look at Psalms for example, the poetry there exudes a message of a loving God, Union, Oneness, Enlightenment, whereas the rest who really knows. The OT has dozens of authors, some of it allegorical, some of it record keeping genealogy, some of it poetry, some of it perhaps may be the author attributing human attributes to god unknowingly so, some of it mystical in nature.</p>

<p>Considering he only had 3 years to teach, and some of these things are deeply complex matters that have to do with transcendence, mystical states, bliss, ego death, nonduality, etc, then he would have known that to keep it simple, watered down, to reach as many people as possible is the best route to go.</p>

<p>In one verse he teaches ego death as the only way to heaven (Born again of water and spirit) and in another verse he tells the thief on the Cross who believes Jesus is legit, that his faith and belief will get him into heaven on the day after he passes.</p>

<p>So there is a lot of flexibility here in terms of modalities of teaching.</p>

<p>All that to say, that I dont think not telling the jews that their OT god is false being is dishonest. I just think its too big and too controversial and causes too much strife, hatred, confusion, etc to be useful in any way, especially when you consider the context of him speaking to a bunch of harded jews who mostly only believe animal sacrificed blood has to pour to a blood thirsty being to appease it for their sins (by slaughtering innocent animals)</p>

<p>So Jesus instead made it simple, i.e. stop doing the animal murder stuff, the 700 rules you have to follow, cutting you male babies foreskins off, and all the other useless stuff, and simply come follow me and these teachings based on love, ego death, entering into your heart where you treasure is</p>

    <div class="md"><p>we can agree to disagree of course. Anyhow, here&#39;s why a I think Jewish demiurge is false god:</p>

<p>In Judaism and sections of the Old Testament, there&#39;s a cover up going on, about YHWH&#39;s wife, Asherah.  Another link here that discusses more of this whole ordeal:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.seeker.com/gods-wife-edited-out-of-the-bible-almost-1766083399.html">https://www.seeker.com/gods-wife-edited-out-of-the-bible-almost-1766083399.html</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>God had a wife, Asherah, whom the Book of Kings suggests was worshiped alongside Yahweh in his temple in Israel, according to an Oxford scholar.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asherah">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asherah</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Asherah is identified as the queen consort of the Sumerian god Anu, and Ugaritic El,[1] the oldest deities of their respective pantheons,[2] as well as Yahweh, the god of Israel and Judah.[3] This role gave her a similarly high rank in the Ugaritic pantheon.[4] Despite her association with Yahweh in extra-biblical sources, Yahweh in the Bible commands the destruction of her shrines so as to maintain purity of worship to Yahweh Himself.[5] </p>

<p>Great Vid on the Above and on jewish god being a false god here:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Uo2oAuXMUg">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Uo2oAuXMUg</a></p>

<p>If you study some NDE&#39;s there are people who go to the other side, and see Spirits as big as cities, as big as planets, and often times they confuse them as &quot;god&quot;, same deal with the Demiurge.</p>

<p>There&#39;s a brilliant NDE report of a man who met the false god and saw hundreds of millions worshiping it:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.trickedbythelight.com/tbtl/nde-transcript.html">http://www.trickedbythelight.com/tbtl/nde-transcript.html</a></p>

<p>Also the biggest evidence for this is the story about Buddha after his enlightenment, your consciousness is freed from the body and can travel and visit anywhere. So he starts mapping out the Spirit realms, and comes across a &quot;god&quot; who tells him he needs to worship him, and if he does he will be let into heaven, but if he doesn&#39;t he will go to hell. Buddha challenges him and wins the challenges, proving that this being is not god, but a false lower being who forgot its origins.</p>

<p>This false god basically has all the same orders to Buddha that are ordered to the jews:</p>

<p><a href="https://thedailyenlightenment.com/2012/03/the-buddhas-victory-over-a-god-demon/">https://thedailyenlightenment.com/2012/03/the-buddhas-victory-over-a-god-demon/</a></p>

<p>Edit* This is probably one of the biggest conspiracies that exist and it is often covered up, not well known, and when you talk about it, shills show up and try to argue that its not true.</p>

<p>Now hear me out. Maybe I&#39;m all wrong about this. Maybe the authors of OT just attributed bad stuff to a good God, but then that makes parts of the OT false. Its certainly a crazy thought exercise that has actually kept me up at night because of its ramifications. This to me is the biggest conspiracy ever</p>
