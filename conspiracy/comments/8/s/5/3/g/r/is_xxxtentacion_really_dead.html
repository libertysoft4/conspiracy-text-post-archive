        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I&#39;ve never visited this subreddit before but figured this would be a good place to put this. As you may have heard, the rapper XXXTENTACION was shot earlier today and was pronounced dead after being comatose. But there&#39;s a few things that point to this being completely false. </p>

<p>First and foremost, when the reports came out that he had been shot, the witnesses reported that he merely looked dead, not that he was. There are a few videos of X floating around and in NONE of them is there blood or a clear gunshot wound. Since he was leaning toward the center console and there were no holes in the door of his BMW i8, he must have gotten shot in the head from the driver&#39;s side, and as previously mentioned, no visible gunshot wound. Even when they took him out of the car, there was no blood anywhere in the car. </p>

<p>So why would he do this? I don&#39;t think it&#39;s a secret organization or anything; I believe he set it up himself to get out of a court case for beating his girlfriend and will probably live out his days in another country. Plus, all of these obvious flaws indicate that it was probably only one, somewhat dumb person setting this up and maybe paying off the cops.</p>
