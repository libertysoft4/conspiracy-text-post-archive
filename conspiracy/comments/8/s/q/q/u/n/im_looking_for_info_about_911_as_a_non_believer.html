        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>First off I&#39;ll say the basics of what I think happened just to get that out of the way. I think planes were hijacked, flown into buildings, and WTC towers collapsed due to plane impacts and fire. I do not think the US government planned or wanted it to happen. I think there are most likely things we&#39;ve not been told such as how much was known before or failures we may have had to prevent the attack or any number of other things.</p>

<p>I&#39;m looking for any evidence along the lines of info from foreign governments, info stolen by hackers, or info leaked by whistleblowers.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve seen so many times that our government isn&#39;t telling us the truth, I can believe that. At the same time I don&#39;t necessarily believe much of what I have seen as proof from conspiracy theorist that it was all planned by our own government and it was controlled demolitions that took down the twin towers and building 7 or any number of other theories about what happened.</p>

<p>I do believe that there are plenty of people/governments that would love to put out documents/emails/pictures/videos of anything that would damage the American government. Have any foreign governments come out and said anything other than the US&#39;s official story happened. What proof have they come out with?</p>

<p>With all the foreign hackers that have gotten into the FBI, CIA, NSA, etc what&#39;s come of it. A lot of secrets have come out of hacks into governments, has any of that happened with 9/11. I can&#39;t see info about 9/11 conspiracies not being a main target for any hackers looking to damage the US.</p>

<p>Has anybody that was part of any 9/11 conspiracy come out and said this is what I did. What&#39;s the best info from whistleblowers?</p>

<p>All of the biggest world news stories about any government&#39;s secrets have mainly come from sources I&#39;m looking for now. Those are the most widely believed stories when it comes to a government conspiracies.</p>

<p>I looked into this over 10 years ago and just shared the 2 videos that came to mind when seeing your question. I&#39;m sure much better material is available meanwhile.</p>

<p>The documentary which you have dismissed stuck to me as it discusses the how (the worldwide video coverage, not the attack).</p>

<p>Do you know how many WTC buildings there were in total?</p>

<p>The chance of her reporting that Building 7 came down that many minutes ahead of schedule with Building 7 in the actual live shot background still standing is fairly slim.</p>

<p>Nobody thinks she was in on it or the anchors back at BBC were either. They point is that they are just script readers &amp; when they mistakenly read the material more than a bit earlier than scheduled it caused someone offscreen to cut her live feed.</p>

<p>There is a video of a guy being interviews right after the impacts &amp; basically the guy gives the reporter a full rundown that Osama Bin Laden was responsible for the attacks BEFORE the US government said anything like that.

<p>So your saying they werent in on it. Then turn around and say the exact opposite in the next sentence</p>

<p>Were they in on it and had knowledge beforehand or not? I dont think they can have a prepared script that was just read early without being in on the conspiracy.</p>

<p>IDK what the chances are but its not out of the realm of possiblity of somebody in New York being up to date on current world affairs enough to know about Osama Bin Laden and think to blame him.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Huh? We all went into school and were taught bullshit. But we as students weren’t in on the intentional dumbing down of education. The news is owned by the elites.

<p>He does not say that. The person cutting the feed is surely also not in on it. He just follows orders : &quot;cut to camera X&quot;.</p>

<p>The way this and many conspiracies seem to work is through segmentation/compartmentalization whereby each has a task without knowing the rest. The higher up this goes, the more dirt they have on the actors in order to keep them in line.</p>

<p>Point is, if you want to look into this with an open mind, you will have to, at least during your investigation period, be completely open to anything, including vast networks of powerful people, not limited to borders, who are pulling strings together to reach a desired scenario.</p>

<p>Please at least watch the entire documentary I linked you before dismissing everything.</p>

<p>In the end you came here to be pointed the way.</p>

<p>I see that as saying her reporting on building 7 collapsing before it does means she knew it was going to go down. As in she had info a head of time</p>

<p>Then he says</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Nobody thinks she was in on it or the anchors back at BBC were either.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As if they didnt have knowledge before hand of it going down</p>

<p>Next is</p>

<blockquote>
<p>They point is that they are just script readers &amp; when they <strong>mistakenly read the material more than a bit earlier than scheduled</strong> it caused someone offscreen to cut her live feed.</p>

<p>This would mean they knew the building was going to go down but they started reporting on it before they should have, as in before the building actually collapsed.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, i see how you interpret it.</p>

<p>What I think he&#39;s saying is that the reporter and anchor in question are not in on it because they don&#39;t question their script at all. And as you said, they are busy, they wouldn&#39;t know exactly what is going on and when.</p>

<p>And I don&#39;t mean script as in &quot;they are willing actors&quot;, just the text shown on the prompter, as they have been doing daily during their career.</p>

<p>What I&#39;m looking for is just something other than a video mashed together that says the planes were fake. If they were fake then someone more official should have been said/leaked from somewhere else in the world.</p>

<p>Many many people will never even attempt to watch anything about any 9/11 conspiracy. They will write it off sort of like I have with somebody saying the planes just didn&#39;t ever exist.</p>

<p>If you want other people to listen, like I&#39;m willing to now, then one of the best ways would be info from a source I&#39;m asking from now. </p>

<p>If random man John Smith makes a video then hardly anybody but the people that already believe will ever watch it.</p>

<p>If China, Russia, literally any country came out and said something, people will listen.</p>

<p>If a major news organization reported on a leak or hack or anything like that, people will listen.</p>

<p>I&#39;m just looking for something released by anybody that is credible and has something to lose making false claims that this was an inside Job.</p>

<p>Random John Smith has nothing to lose if he releases a YouTube video that is all lies. Any government or major news organization that comes out with info would have good info because they have the most to lose if they lie.</p>

I could go on for hours about this, but I’ll leave you with two facts that SHOULD tell you all you need to know: Shanksville: the engine was found 10 miles away. When a plane crashes typically it doesn’t travel 10 entire miles aways, therefore it was without a doubt shot out of the sky, as opposed to crashed (or brought down by passengers). Also, building 7. Only building in HISTORY to collapse due to fire alone. No plane hit it, just caught fire and collapsed. Need more? Lmk</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Logic tells me the official story isn&#39;t true. The official report is asking me to accept too many unlikely things happening in one day. I can barely accept one plane flown by someone with only a little experience on simulators hitting its target at a speed that was way over the speed limit for such a plane so near sea level. Three in one day in almost impossible. OP, research the speeds planes can go so near sea level and still be controlled and still remain intact. The speeds they were going and with such a quick drop or in the case of the Pentagon, it was highly unlikely that even an experienced pilot could hit their targets so perfectly.</p>

<p>Logic also tells me that a plane with its transponder turned off and reported to be hijacked would never get anywhere near Washington D.C.&#39;s highly protected airspace. But I&#39;m being asked to accept a coincidence that on that day the planes that should have been guarding the air space were off involved in a training exercise that included hijacked planes. A plane was allowed to just come in and hit the Pentagon in a perfectly executed, difficult maneuver at high speeds that were way over the speed limit for such a plane. </p>

<p>Norman Mineta&#39;s <strong>excluded</strong> testimony to the 911 commission supports the reality that the plane that hit the Pentagon was allowed to do so.</p>

<p>As for the 3 steel-structured buildings that collapsed at near free fall speed into their own footprints—two of them turning into dust on the way down—it is obvious to me they were done so by some form of demolition. It&#39;s illogical to believe that three such buildings came down in the same day in the ways that they did due to small fires. That the South and North towers would turn to dust like they did.</p>

<p>Research the materials provided at Architects For 911 Truth and Pilots For 911 Truth.</p>

<p>It&#39;s also illogical to believe all those cell phones calls from the passengers made it through like they supposedly did from the heights and the speeds that those planes were going. I&#39;ve talked to flight attendants over the years and asked them if you could make cell phones calls on air born planes at the time of 911, and everyone one of them said no. There are other flight attendants on record, and a study or two that supports this.</p>

<p>Those are my main bones of contention. There are a lot of other details that are just way too coincidental and strange that when added up to the coincidence and improbable things list just is way beyond my ability to suspend disbelief.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You say governments, but there are few with solid enough intelligence to know for certain. Russia probably knows, but the US itself has been damaged ever since 9/11. It is in their interest to watch the US slow mo implode- why interfer? The US also has the goods on Russia&#39;s own false flags:</p>

<p>The Russian apartment bombings were a series of explosions that hit four apartment blocks in the Russian cities of Buynaksk, Moscow and Volgodonsk in September 1999, killing 293 and injuring more than 1000 people and spreading a wave of fear across the country. The bombings, together with the Dagestan War, led the country into the Second Chechen War. Vladimir Putin’s handling of the crisis boosted his popularity and helped him attain presidency within a few months.</p>

<p>There is an enormous body of evidence from those actually interested in what happened which has accumulated over the years. </p>

<p>I&#39;m not sure exactly what you want, you could try watching Nat Geo&#39;s Triple Cross on YouTube. I don&#39;t know if that&#39;s what you really want or not. Nobody has solved 911 so there isn&#39;t no clean summary, except that al Qaeda was the orgaanistion used to carry it out.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You will be bombarded with Israel did it and we are puppets of their govt but I dont believe it one bit. Look at the Saudis. Indira Singh is where I would start if I were you. Some people, who are big on the conspiracy scene, are major anti-semites. I hate using that word because it brings a little harsher word than I want but anyway. You have to filter through a lot of stuff that they will put out there. So always do cross checking on things you read, find sources of their material to verify and always do background on who it is you are reading. You will find a lot of people say things as fact but it is really their own far-fetched theory. </p>

<p>That is why I would say to start with Indira Singh as she was a part of a very big deal with Saudi&#39;s, the USA and 9/11. She wasn&#39;t a conspiracy theorist. She was a genius who just stumbled into a massive conspiracy with our Govt and the Saudis because of where she worked. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hey, just because I don&#39;t currently believe in the vast majority of 9/11 conspiracy theories doesn&#39;t mean that it&#39;s impossible for me change my views. If presented with some more proper evidence than a YouTube video saying that the planes just didn&#39;t exist I will certainly look into it to find some truth I may not know.</p>

<p>Saying I&#39;m here to just stir up shit is false. I may not be accepting of all the &quot;evidence&quot; that was given here but at the same time I did state what kind of things I was looking for, because I have never seen evidence of that caliber before.</p>

<p>Submission statements only need to go with posts that are links. This was not a link post, this was a text post. There whole point of submission statements is to say why you made a post. The reason I made a post is explicitly explained in the post itself, therefore no submission statements required for text posts.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Could you clarify something, maybe I have the wrong info. </p>

<p>10,000 feet is under 2 miles. Cell towers have been able to reach at least 10-20 miles, with clear longer of sight, since before 2001. </p>

<p>We had the technology to use phones on planes for a long time but it wasn&#39;t allowed. If cell phones were useless all the way up at normal altitudes then we wouldn&#39;t have had to worry about any interference from a plane full of passengers talking on their phones.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sure, but the propagation field is and was aimed at the ground not the sky. Even analog propagates in a torus pattern. Directional is aimed at the ground. They didn&#39;t/don&#39;t want your phones transmitting during take off and landing as not to interfere with the planes avionics/commo. Handoffs are designed to happen at 60 mph. No way your gonna perform a HO, much less an anchor HO at jet speeds. So like I said, at best a call of just a few seconds could have occurred but even that is doubtful.</p>
