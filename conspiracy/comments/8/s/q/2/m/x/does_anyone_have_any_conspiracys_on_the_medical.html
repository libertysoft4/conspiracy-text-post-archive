<p>I also just realized the same goes for acne medication. I started taking vitamin D and my acne is clearing up.. but teens are taking acutane and all that shit and their acne doesn’t even always clear up! I have searched how to clear acne for years and my mom did extensive research to help my siblings with acne. I came across vitamin D through and friend and asked my mom if she ever came across vitamin D during her research and seeing dermatologists FOR OVER 10 YEARS!! and never heard of vitamin D to clear acne... </p>

<p>okay, maybe I’m not on to anything but I wanted to know if anyone knew of any similar types of conspiracy’s. I’m so curious to read into it</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah you should start with googling Dr. Sebi and research his medicinal journey. Read Psychedelic Medicine by Dr. Richard Miller. Also Dr. Raphael Mechulom for cannabis, he isolated the the compound in ‘64. Then there’s Dr. Melamede. I would strong encourage you to YouTube all of them when you have days to dedicate. I’ve spent the past 4 years learning of this after I was 51/50d, drugged Ativan in the ER for wanting to kill myself due to a rape: then told it was a psychosis and I needed medication. Woke up in mental institution and was forced several drugs without my knowledge of what it was. Got stable enough to leave.  Began working with a drs office. Requested medical records with alias. Mental institution has me verbally confirms records will not be released to patient (myself). Upon reviewing documents missing prescriptions with inpatient stay is first red flag. Not listing therapist names I saw or even documenting I had therapy sessions which included the testimony of the rape. Discharged and put on more antipsychotic meds. Since squiring these falsified medical records I have been advocating for cannabis use for patients that have any sort of PTSD or disorders that have been influenced by corporations that profit from pharmaceutical drugs and people that are then considered disabled. Idk that’s just my experience in the dark corners of healthcare. Not to mention how easy it is to get opioids from a Dr. fuck that noise. Bring the feminine energy back to healing with plants not synthetics. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Personal experience. I&#39;ve used it in conjunction with therapy and it&#39;s beyond effective at destroying the barriers that make it difficult to look inside oneself.  I&#39;m talking about military grade mama. Yes there is such a thing.  In fact mama was at one point prescribed by my mother (a corpman/field medic) for ptsd. By the fda  ducked that up. I know from experience that shoots do NOT cause enough if an ego boost to emotionally sustain the energy required for that kind of mental work.  Shrimps are better for blacking thins out.  Mdma for recall.  This is personal trial and discovery here.  I&#39;m of the mind that self medicating is FAAAR more effective than any series if chemicals and innoculants prescribed by the state. Self expermentatation is dangerous and WILL cause unintended consequences. But once you figure yourself out its all wavy gravy after that. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m a chemist, I think statute of limitations has long since expired years ago so I can talk about it. I have never heard of military grade, but I was producing mdma that qas to all intents and purposes pure. My experience was that the experience was too unstable, non-reproducible, to be effective that way. But, I was also probably taking way more than would be recommended in a medical context. I&#39;m aware of the studies showing the efficacy for PTSD, I just think psilocybin has a deeper and more persistent effect.</p>

<p>But, as ever and always, biochemistry, specifically neurochemistry...is extremely particular to the individual. If it is working well for you, then it is the right thing. Anyone coming through here reading this should be encouraged to try all options and find the best fit for themselves.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Folks tend to overlook the anti inflammatory effects of psychedelics.  I tend to have achey joints and have to pay attention to what I eat or my gut will act up - but with LSD and shrooms, everything clears up and I feel fantastic.  And it&#39;s not placebo or imagined - my physical capabilities and dexterity while tripping are objectively superior to my sober state.  I wish there was more research on their effects as immunomodulators/anti inflammatories.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve heard some folks advocate microdoses of DOB for this reason.  Apparently it works well and has a long duration of effect.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Also perhaps cbd for your wife would be best. Thc for me is nice when used topically or orally ingesting in like a tea or coconut oil infusion. Rick Simpson Oil is like gold to cancer patients. Finding strains of cannabis with higher cbd but some thc gives an entourage effect, meaning the ratio of thc-cbd (unless with hemp)may work best with ones individualized endocannabinoid system. But per our research over here, both compounds are key to homeostasis. Cannabis was prohibited back in the 1906 and since then, one correlation I’ve made is the rise in cancers and autoimmune diseases. Perhaps...(I mean of course) the environmental factors also played a role in this trend, however since the legalization act of proposition 215 right here in Ca. many patients with these disorders find relief and even remission while using high concentrates of cannabis along with an alkaline diet. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I go to an Amish doctor in Kentucky who has cured a lot of stuff in my family with completely natural means. I&#39;m not saying he can cure everything but he has cleared up an auto-immune disease, thyroid issues, 90&amp;#37; blockage in the artery of an 80 yr old, etc... Once my family members went back to the doctors they had been seeing, with a full bill of health, and not taking the drugs they were prescribed, the docs were at a loss. While most of the doctors look at my fam with total disbelief, they all did say to continue doing whatever they were doing that was helping these things. The only doctor who looked into the things they were taking, actually ended up going to see Rueben in KY. He is a cardiologist and after he started going, the other partners in his practice started going as well. The part that sucks about the Govt oversight on this is that these doctors now know that some of the things he gives patients do work, without the HORRIBLE side effects, but they can&#39;t tell their patients to go see him. I think that is completely ludicrous. The FDA, who is run by Big Pharma, is the problem with it. They actually raided Rueben&#39;s office years back and almost shut him down. If he wasn&#39;t Amish, I guarantee they would have buried him. Instead, now he has to label his tinctures and herbs, NOT FOR HUMAN CONSUMPTION. How crazy is that? You label completely natural things, NOT FOR HUMAN CONSUMPTION.</p>

<p>The fact that they know some of this works, yet try to scare people from taking it by labeling it that way is total bullshit. And it isn&#39;t like he is out there driving a Ferrari. He may have a nice mule to pull his buggy r something though, lol. It doesn&#39;t even cost anything to see him. He does charge for anything he thinks you should take because they make it there so they should b paid for the work they do. Or, if you want to order things online that he prescribes, you are free to do that as well. My father in law orders cow colostrum for his auto immune disease, instead of more steroids than a cancer patient</p>

I thought it sounded really wild at first, but I&#39;ve dealt with a lot of health issues and felt hopeless- and a lot of people talk about IF - but he talks about the medical establishment plus talks about long term fasting. He has stuff on YouTube too and a lot of blogs, I love reading his stuff I find him really insightful, helpful and entertaining. </p>

<p>&quot;The 1964 murder of a nationally known cancer researcher sets the stage for this gripping exposé of medical professionals enmeshed in covert government operations over the course of three decades. Following a trail of police records, FBI files, cancer statistics, and medical journals, this revealing book presents evidence of a web of medical secret-keeping that began with the handling of evidence in the JFK assassination and continued apace, sweeping doctors into coverups of cancer outbreaks, contaminated polio vaccine, the arrival of the AIDS virus, and biological weapon research using infected monkeys.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Skin care:</p>

<p>All these anti-oil and oil-free products make your skin worse. Our bodies need oils to regulate our skin. I had acne as well and then stopped using face wash and started oil cleansing instead; cleared right up.</p>

<p>Cancer:</p>

<p>You&#39;d think all the fundraising and donating for cancer &quot;research&quot; over 20+ years would have given us something better than radiation that makes patients even sicker? Medical cannabis works to fight cancer and there is actual science to back that up, but you don&#39;t see doctors giving that option 99% of the time.</p>

<p>Toothpaste:</p>

<p>Fluoride is a nuclear waste byproduct with adverse side effects if ingested. What makes it safe to add to a product people use at least twice a day? Potential side effects of brushing with fluoride: 1. Weakens Skeletal Health
2. Causes Arthritis
3. Toxic to the Thyroid
4. Calcifies the Ultra-Important Pineal Gland
5. Accelerates Female Puberty
6. Harmful to Male and Female Fertility
7. Bad for Kidney Health
8. Harmful to the Cardiovascular System
9. Negative Cognitive Effects</p>

<p>Most studies have shown that cannabis does NOT fight cancer. BUT it does help with the side effects of chemo. Lots of doctors also get cancer or have families who do. And someone who discovered a cure would get the Nobel prize and be very wealthy. </p>

<p>Fluoride occurs naturally in nature.</p>

<p>I started taking vitamin D and my acne is clearing up.. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Vitamin D comes from the sun, you can get your daily dose by spending 15 mins a day outside.
If that&#39;s all it has taken to clear up your acne then good for you, you&#39;re one of the lucky ones with mild acne.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>but teens are taking acutane and all that shit and their acne doesn’t even always clear up!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Accutane aka isotretinoin is a pharmaceutical product of Vitamin A. It is the only known cure for severe acne, especially cystic acne. It works by shrinking the oil glands that produce too much oil that cause cysts and acne.</p>

<p>It is extremely effective and is only given to people who have stubborn and or cystic acne. It isn&#39;t handed out like candy. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>I came across vitamin D through and friend and asked my mom if she ever came across vitamin D during her research and seeing dermatologists FOR OVER 10 YEARS!! and never heard of vitamin D to clear acne... </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Vitamin D is converted by our bodies when we are exposed to the sun. 15 minutes is all you need for your daily dose, depending where you live.</p>

<p>This isn&#39;t a conspiracy.</p>
