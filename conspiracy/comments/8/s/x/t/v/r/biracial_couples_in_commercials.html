    <div class="md"><p>Yes, I’ve noticed that kind of thing too. I think commercials are an important part of mind programming because people tend to pay only half attention while they’re watching so it goes straight to the unconscious. </p>

<p>What does this all point to? An attack on white racial identity or perhaps racial identity itself. Unfortunately you can’t even bring up a topic without being called racist, alt-right, etc... I’ve already been called racist multiple times in this thread, which is ridiculous. I’m just pointing something out that is obvious.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Bonus round: there is an agenda called the Kalergi plan which openly calls for race mixing in order to create people that are easier to control. Fact.</p>

<p>Anyway,  I&#39;ve noticed that it is always a white woman with a darker skinned man. Has anyone seen a commercial with a white man and a darker skinned woman? I don&#39;t watch much TV but I have noticed that trend.</p>

<p>And for all the people that want to call me racist, save it. I absolutely love other cultures and judge people individually on how they behave and interact with me. Judging and hating an entire race for whatever reason is fucking idiotic. I don&#39;t give a shit who is fucking who and have no problem dating outside my own race. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Blatantly racist overtones from your post aside, there was an <a href="http://www.wbur.org/hereandnow/2018/06/15/advertising-interracial-lgbt-diversity">segment on NPR</a> I caught about it the other day. The TL;DL is that there is a big demographic out there and advertisers often take a strategy of seeing how far they can push a particular image without turning off, well, bigots. So, an ad that prtrays an ambiguously gay couple will instantly resonate with the gay population while not necessarily even keying in with the heterosexual population. And a lot of people not in e.g. a biracial relationship will still respond positively to the message of inclusiveness portrayed in the ad.</p>

<p>A racist is just someone who thinks other races are inferior to their own, it&#39;s only a pejorative if you think the races are equal.</p>

<p>But &quot;racism&quot; does imply hatred, and is too often used inappropriately.  In-group biased is the correct term, because it is the appropriate term.</p>

<p>I suppose that would still count as racial prejudice which is also part of the definition of racism. I&#39;ve never encountered someone hate a race because they believe they&#39;re superior.</p>

<p>Regardless, the person you initially responded to was explicitly talking about feelings of racial superiority.</p>

<p>&quot;People should like it when I fling pejoratives at them in an attempt to shutdown discourse with a thought-terminating cliche, even when it&#39;s not appropriate.&quot;  Lol, you would think that way!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If racism is true then it stands to reason that there&#39;s nothing wrong with being racist. Since racists believe racism is true they must also believe that there is nothing wrong with being a racist, so they should declare it with pride. Hiding their true nature is cowardly.</p>

<p>Other groups with unpopular beliefs don&#39;t have this same cowardice towards using the appropriate labels for themselves.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Truth be told, if folks like yourself could stick to calling people &quot;racist&quot; only when it&#39;s appropriate,  then you might have legs to stand on.  Time tells another story though. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Folks like me? Seems like you&#39;re making a lot of assumptions about me just because we disagree.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>But &quot;racism&quot; does imply hatred, and is too often used inappropriately.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Racism implies prejudice which can include hatred. In-group bias could be your country, your friends, your subculture, etc.</p>

<p>Racism is a form of in-group bias, I&#39;m not saying you can&#39;t use in-group bias to describe it but racism is a much less ambiguous term because we know specific which in-group is being referred to.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;In-group biased&quot; is the correct term, because it is the appropriate term.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It&#39;s the correct term because it is the appropriate term? That&#39;s an empty statement, you may as well have said it&#39;s the correct term because it&#39;s the correct term.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You just don&#39;t like it, because you&#39;ve never shamed anyone into silence by calling them &quot;in-group biased.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Have I upset you in some way? Why are you making disingenuous assumptions about my character?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You have to look at it from a world perspective. America has 320 million people and 245 million are White (could include &#39;white&#39; Hispanics.)</p>

<p>Europe in 2015 was estimated to be 741 million according to the United Nations,[1] which was slightly less than 11 % of the world population.
105 million are minorities.</p>

<p>As of 2016, the total population of Africa is estimated at estimated at 1.225 billion, representing 17% of the world&#39;s population. According to UN estimates, the population of Africa may reach 2.5 billion by 2050 (about 26% of the world&#39;s total) and nearly 4.5 billion by 2100 (about 40% of the world&#39;s total</p>

<p>China&#39;s population is 1.411 billion[1], the largest of any country in the world. According to the 2010 census, 91.51% of the population was Han Chinese, and 8.49% were minorities.</p>

<p>India is the second most populated country in the world with nearly a fifth of the world&#39;s population. According to the 2017 revision of the World Population Prospects[1], the population stood at 1,324,171,354.</p>

<p>So there are 881 million people living in Europe and America (Europe&#39;s population counts &quot;minorities&quot; in it) (Tongans and Samoans are real minorities, Mexicans are also a world minority at 120 million people in the country) I would guess that 881 would turn to 600-700 million after dropping the &quot;minorities.&quot;</p>

<p>Australia has 25 million people and , 495,757 respondents declared they were Aboriginal, 31,407 declared they were Torres Strait Islander, and a further 21,206 declared they were both Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders.[9] that&#39;s not counting the Asians flooding in too.</p>

<p>So in total Europeans make up about 625 to 725 million worldwide. Any of the three countries eclipse Europeans just in there home countries (not counting them abroad.)</p>

<p>Canada is basically a non factor at 35 million. Mexico has more people.</p>

<p>See my point? And Europeans are being outbred on a crazy scale. Where I live the population is like two right angle triangles. One long end is 65+ white people and goes down to nothing for newborns. For blacks its the opposite. The long end is newborns and the short end is 65+. !/ /!</p>

<p>Here is the conclusions of that research </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Nevertheless, most mixed-race adolescents are at low risk. Most of the risk items we assessed may be interpreted as related to stress, so we may therefore choose to interpret mixed race as a source of stress. We cannot identify further the source of the stress</p>

<p>So there is a slight issue seemingly related to stress over identify. Sounds to me like the issue is social attitudes, not anything genetic or biological.</p>

What they are selling is an attitude- a flashy new color/perspective/attitude that the majority of their customers seem to be attractive. It&#39;s Woke Inc. Most of the people in the focus groups that they are trying to appeal to, won&#39;t ever marry someone who is not of their race; but they want to be a part of what that imagery represents (not the thing itself). When you consider that women control 20 trillion in worldwide purchasing (they may not make the money, but they are decision makers on most purchases...)- you can see how this comes to be something that focus groups highlight as desirable.  The sad truth is this is how adverts in our society work and have always worked since Bernays (and probably well before that). Mixed race couples in these ads are just props.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There really isn&#39;t. I&#39;ve worked in advertising and commercial film production for 15 years and you realize that it&#39;s not that organized. There are tons of real conspiracies out there but the racial engineering one is up there with Jesus being real. We want someone or something to be in charged- order is very appealing to most of us- but it&#39;s just not what it is. And if you fall down the rabbit hole of how this shit works and why it works, it&#39;s much more fucked up than whatever nonsense is in this thread. (But then again, I&#39;m not 19)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree with the first part of your answer but Hitler was just another bloodline member of the Illuminati. He’s part of the same overall agenda that is now subverting the white race with this biracial crap. Remember the Nazis were <em>supposed</em> to (officially) lose WW2, so they could go underground and start manipulating the world through Project Paperclip, etc... It all fits into the grander narrative that’s playing out now.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Race mixing works counter to incest. Which is what yiu are advocating. Small genepool leads to lower IQ&#39;s, fewer resistances to diseases and a generally poor appearance (premature baldness, crooked teeth).
The british royalty have horrid teeth because they refuse to allow mixing outside the family.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You have to look at it from a world perspective. America has 320 million people and 245 million are White (could include &#39;white&#39; Hispanics.)</p>

<p>Europe in 2015 was estimated to be 741 million according to the United Nations,[1] which was slightly less than 11 % of the world population.
105 million are minorities.</p>

<p>As of 2016, the total population of Africa is estimated at estimated at 1.225 billion, representing 17% of the world&#39;s population. According to UN estimates, the population of Africa may reach 2.5 billion by 2050 (about 26% of the world&#39;s total) and nearly 4.5 billion by 2100 (about 40% of the world&#39;s total</p>

<p>China&#39;s population is 1.411 billion[1], the largest of any country in the world. According to the 2010 census, 91.51% of the population was Han Chinese, and 8.49% were minorities.</p>

<p>India is the second most populated country in the world with nearly a fifth of the world&#39;s population. According to the 2017 revision of the World Population Prospects[1], the population stood at 1,324,171,354.</p>

<p>So there are 881 million people living in Europe and America (Europe&#39;s population counts &quot;minorities&quot; in it) (Tongans and Samoans are real minorities, Mexicans are also a world minority at 120 million people in the country) I would guess that 881 would turn to 600-700 million after dropping the &quot;minorities.&quot;</p>

<p>Australia has 25 million people and , 495,757 respondents declared they were Aboriginal, 31,407 declared they were Torres Strait Islander, and a further 21,206 declared they were both Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders.[9] that&#39;s not counting the Asians flooding in too.</p>

<p>So in total Europeans make up about 625 to 725 million worldwide. Any of the three countries eclipse Europeans just in there home countries (not counting them abroad.)</p>

<p>Canada is basically a non factor at 35 million. Mexico has more people.</p>

<p>See my point? And Europeans are being outbred on a crazy scale. Where I live the population is like two right angle triangles. One long end is 65+ white people and goes down to nothing for newborns. For blacks its the opposite. The long end is newborns and the short end is 65+. !/ /!</p>
