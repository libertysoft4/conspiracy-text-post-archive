        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Sexual promiscuity is leading us to a global mass extinction event. Already antibiotics are becoming useless to some forms of these infections. Soon &quot;having a good time&quot; will result in millions of children dying from drug resistant disease. Promiscuity is not just detrimental to your own mental and physical health, but it is harmful to the health of the human genome. Context matters. Having sexual relationships within the context of a relationship is the only healthy way to have sex. Go talk to someone, get to know them, then bang. Banging random people is absolutely degenerate. Not only that, a promiscuous lifestyle has the chance to cause permanent physical and psychological harm.</p>

<p>Is There a Price to Pay for Promiscuity?
Society puts an emphasis on sexuality — but casual sex can impact your physical and emotional health in ways that you may not suspect.</p>

<p>Having a stable relationship and sex life is healthy. Having sex with different people all the time is very detrimental to your mental and physical health. Not just you though. It has an effect on all of society.</p>

<p>Again; context matters.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sex with multiple people throughout your life is fine. It&#39;s just important to form a relationship with the people your having sex with. Sex is more than just &quot;a good time&quot;. The act forms neuro pathways that we can call &quot;love&quot;. Sex with multiple partners randomly I.e. hooking up with strangers does damage to this aspect of the brain.</p>

<p>That&#39;s me agreeing with the OP but offering the idea that opposing ideas exist, based on individual thought. </p>

<p>The reason i can offer that argument is not because i think people should sleep around (I&#39;ve been with Mrs Tron a long time and we are monogamous) but because having liberal ideas about other stuff, I&#39;m understand liberal thought processes. </p>

<p>I believe it can be morally wrong if it becomes a lifestyle. No penalty is necessary, the psychological damage and stds are punishment enough.</p>

<p>And I could ask you; do you think age should be a factor? Is it immoral for someone to have sex with someone under 18</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think in that situation it depends. If a 19 or 20 year old has sex with an 18 year old? I don’t think that’s immoral.  When you’re that young I don’t think you know enough about the world to make decisions in our own best interest. I would see it as someone taking advantage. Two consenting adults engaging in casual sex? I have no doubt in my mind that that is morally ok. Which is what this debate started as and seems to me to be the only relevant discussion in the terms of the original post you made.  </p>

<p>Originally, marriage was the form of social control. An institution of the Church, marriage kept men working and providing for women, keeping everyone good little slaves to the system.</p>

<p>But there is strength in numbers, and TPTB realized that. They are now working to isolate everyone and destroy the nuclear family. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Of course they did, but it was highly discouraged.  </p>

<p>My grandmother wanted nothing more than to go to college and become a business woman.  My family was aghast, and instead she was denied a higher education like all others in her town and spent her life raising kids and her husband.  When she finally got a job as a switchboard operator at a telephone company it was quite the scandal.</p>

<p>Conversely, it was not a scandal when my mother got a job at a major corporation, so progress was made due to feminism - however she was sexually harassed for years and never made as much as her male counterparts.  Which is <em>still</em> going on in the workplace today.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ok. So it&#39;s really only in certain jobs; those who don&#39;t state the pay and where discretion is left to the hiring managers who don&#39;t make up their minds until meeting the potential employee that the inequality exists?  I&#39;m just asking because many of the women I know make excellent money and I have yet to ever hear one complain. They are for the majority college educated as am I. I tend to work in areas I enjoy; working for satisfaction rather than money, so ever comparing my pay versus the women I know is not really adequate. So I hear a lot although exclusively via media about the pay inequality for women but have a hard time seeing - so all in all this is why I&#39;m asking.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is actually entirely dependent upon the person. More than 50% of people are getting divorced now. Apparently something is wrong. I think monogamy is a thing of the past now. If you want to start a family and have old family traditions, then great go find a spouse and build a life together and invest your time into one another. But some people need diversity when it comes to sex. Monogamy was great for hundreds of years because we needed to reproduce and you need to be with someone long enough to do that. Now we have lives where we can fulfill our own desires and proceed with our own goals. I think there’s a lot of people that just don’t have that degree of attention anymore. It doesn’t necessarily mean you’re ill willed or don’t see the other partner as a human being. I believe if both people are safe and use the correct methods and Are making sure they don’t have any diseases, sex can be a great thing to do with other people. But for the most part you’re all retarded and don’t know how to do it safely. Sorry not sorry lol I see people all around getting pregnant and diseases and all I can think about is you guys aren’t careful enough and it gives casual sex a bad name. I just can’t see having sex with the same person for the rest of my life. It just seems entirely selfish from each person to expect that the other will hold the other person’s attention forever.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I just think when it comes to relationships, people are entirely different. It’s like trying to agree with people about what they think God is. But it’s how they think a relationship is. If you aren’t a part of any religion and you don’t plan on ever having kids, why not have flings once in a while? If you and your partner committed to each other through thick and thin and are safe in picking other like-minded partners,but just like to have a little casual fun, I don’t see how there would be a problem with that. It’s all in trying to find who is compatible with you. Again, if you are in anyway shape or form thinking of starting families or what have you then yes definitely make sure the people you are dating are thinking and sharing the same end goals.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t mean to take apart your comment, buuuutt....</p>

<p>There are many ways to become less repellent to women.  First, try meeting more women with substance, as it sounds like you could be growing bitter and that&#39;s <em>always</em> a repellent.  </p>

<p>Also, you&#39;re just 26 - I&#39;m in my 40&#39;s and these years totally beat out my 20&#39;s.  In fact, most friends my age agree and shudder at the thought of their 20&#39;s.  </p>

<p>So if you are really interested in losing your &quot;v card&quot; - develop some interests, become interesting, engage in those interests and the women will notice.</p>

<p>It&#39;s not all &quot;hot&quot; guys getting laid out there, I promise you.</p>

<p>Women <em>are</em> no longer penalized for promiscuity and the negative consequences are quite apparent in society today. The focus on materialistic pursuits is demonstrated clearly through the promotion of indiscriminate fornication (for both sexes really but for men less so) and it has turned into an obsession. So you like to suck dick...keep it to yourself.</p>

<p>There was a day where men were shamed for being too promiscous as well...the solution isn&#39;t to forego the shaming for both sexes and stand behind indiscriminate fornication as a healthy and natural thing, it is to have some damn dignity and focus on something else besides hedonistic pleasure.</p>

<p>Nope, it&#39;s not as bad as the past but unfortunately the double standard you promote is still common.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>The solution is to keep out of other people&#39;s bedrooms.</p>

<p>And casual sex is natural, all sex was &quot;indiscriminate fornication&quot; in the wild. Not that I believe appealing to nature is a good argument, good things can be unnatural, bad things can be natural.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, I’m not. It is affecting another person. Which as I stated many times, is different then doing something to your own body. You’re the one who brought the morality of flashing someone into this. I don’t carry a bible and I’m not religious in any way. You tell me to keep a bible to myself when you are the one pushing your own morals on to others. A little hypocritical no?</p>
