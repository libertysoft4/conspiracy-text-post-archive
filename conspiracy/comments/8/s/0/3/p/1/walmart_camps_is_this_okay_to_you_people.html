    <div class="md"><p>Honestly, it&#39;s the best solution for a horrible situation. There aren&#39;t many options, and all of the rest of them are far, far worse.</p>

<p>We could just stop enforcing border security completely and allow anyone who crosses the border to stay. With that would come economic depression as workers would quickly outnumber jobs once people realized we no longer enforced the border and migrants swarmed our nation.</p>

<p>We could send the children to adult detention facilities with their parents, but there are laws specifically against that because of the dangers it places those children under. Minors in adult facilities are often abused, raped, and taken advantage of by other adults. </p>

<p>We could detain the parents and just leave the kids on the streets, but they would starve.</p>

<p>Or we could detain both the parents and the children temporarily until they could be returned safely to their home countries or have their asylum claims approved, housing the adults in one facility and the minors in another where they can be kept safe. This is currently the best option until such a time when people agree to:</p>

<p>Build the wall! It would stop this whole mess completely. Not only would it physically stop the influx of economic migrants across our open borders, but it would act as a symbol of our willingness to enforce borders and stop many of those from attempting the journey so that only those who have the greatest need for actual asylum would come.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The relationship is reciprocal. A huge part of our economy relies on illegal immigration. It&#39;s extremely naive to think illegals are coming here instantly become a burden. There is a very large demand for labor that pretty much only these people are willing to do. The laws weren&#39;t being enforced because of our nation&#39;s reliance on dirt cheap labor for jobs we forget even exist. It&#39;s mostly unfair to the illegal immigrants and extremely beneficial to the United States.. but it&#39;s the price they pay to escape wherever it is they came from.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Raise the penalties and make a few public examples out of people and corporations doing this and you&#39;ll see it lower dramatically.  Put a couple of restaurants and construction companies out of business with fines and you&#39;ll see businessmen who want to make money get with the program real quick.  </p>

<p>Most illegal immigrants are people who overstay their visa.  No wall will stop that.  Over a thousand miles of the border with Mexico is the Rio Grande river.  Are we going to build a wall in the middle of it?  How do we build a wall through the middle of the Gulf of Mexico or through the Pacific Ocean to cut off boat bound illegals?  Even if you build a wall, you have to have a large network of guards and surveillance to defend the wall (The reason the Great Wall of China eventually failed).  </p>

<p>It&#39;s a whole lot of expense for not much in actual security against illegal labor when the most effective method against illegal labor, attacking demand, goes unenforced.  (And I&#39;m a lefty who would actually be willing to compromise on the wall if Conservatives need it so badly, in exchange for certain concessions, concessions that the President has abjectly refused.)</p>

<p>Do you have a source for this?  Because most of what I can find says 40% are visa overstays, which as you know, means the majority are not visa overstays.  And the data used to come up with that number is from 1997, so it&#39;s basically useless for drawing any conclusions today.  The reality is that we have no idea how many illegal immigrants are here, or how they got here.  Any number you see is just a guess.</p>

<p>Of course a wall isn&#39;t going to stop visa overstays.  I don&#39;t see how that&#39;s an argument against the wall?  It was never intended to do that, so of course it&#39;s not.  It&#39;s like saying that seat belts don&#39;t stop people from driving drunk, so we don&#39;t need seat belts.  </p>

<p>The wall is intended to stop illegal crossings.  It won&#39;t stop them all. Nothing will.  But it will make it more difficult and will stop a significant number.</p>

<p>As far as money is concerned, how much do you think we spend each year on welfare, medicaid, schooling for illegal immigrants and their children?  I&#39;ve seen estimates of more than $100 billion a year.  Obviously these statistics will be contested, but I would take a one time hit of $20 billion to put a big dent in that recurring figure.  I think that&#39;s fiscally sound.   And the maintenance and security costs are not a big deal and would most likely be offset by less need for a giant border patrol force that currently has to monitor thousands of square miles of land, instead of just watching a wall.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>We should do that as well.  Nationwide mandatory E-Verify is needed, but to enforce it will require ICE raid businesses because they are hiring illegal aliens under the table and the only way to prove that is to catch them in the act.  Unfortunately, most people who say that we should increase penalties for hiring illegals also oppose doing the things that would actually make that effective.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s not a compromise.  We also already tried it in 1986, and then all the talk about &quot;compromise&quot; by the Democrats evaporated, and they fought any effort to stop illegal immigration, and now we&#39;re in the same situation again.</p>

<p>Democrats don&#39;t want immigration laws to be enforced at all.  But they will lie and say they do, if they can trick those stupid conservatives into giving another amnesty.</p>

<p>There are definitely Republicans that are weak on immigration, and Reagan was one of them.  Although I think he made the mistake of thinking that the Democrats were negotiating in good faith, and they actually wanted to solve the problem.  They didn&#39;t.  They just wanted amnesty, and the situation is the same today.  They turned California from Red to Blue in the &#39;80&#39;s, and they want to do it again with Texas and any other Red state that&#39;s been flooded with illegals in the past three decades.</p>

<p>Are you a Congressman?  If not, why would I care what you would do?  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>For example, though I don&#39;t think much of Virginia Senate candidate, Corey Stewart, as a whole, however, his program to certify the citizenship of every person who is arrested and enter jail, and turn over to ICE all illegals who are charged with crimes, is a good one, and one I&#39;d be cool with to see adopted nationally, so long as certain protections, like certifying EVERYONE, and not racially profiling, are met.</p>

<p>I know this won&#39;t be popular here, but an alternate solution to punishing the people who hire the would be to let them have basic rights to organize and receive a US minimum wage. </p>

<p>Another big part of the equation would be to legalize all drugs so the economy goes above ground. This would probably solve most of Mexico&#39;s problems since gamsterism seems to be the biggest driver of the corruption that plagues their economy. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You have to wonder at immigration policies that consistently ignore the labor needs of the country and that put ppl in harm’s way.  Maybe it is convenient to have an underclass of workers without rights that must take the most tedious and exhausting jobs for poor wages. You can even vilify them and blame them for any ills or oversights the govt’s is responsible for.  You can justify being inhumane and cruel to <em>all of them</em> when it is the govt’s lack of coherent policy and enforcement that is to blame. Like, why are employers off the hook for hiring them, this making it even possible for them to stay in the country?  Why is there not a “worker visa” that need not involve citizenship, but would provide identification and legitimacy to ppl already in the country?  Not everyone who needs to make a living desires citizenship in US.  At the minimum, policies should be civilized and humane. </p>

<p>The other point, the US is a big factor in meddling in many of these countries’ govt’s and policies, blatantly subverting democracies south of the border.  The US is to blame for the conditions forcing ppl to flee their countries. It’s obscene what the alphabet agencies have been up to in the name of US. All Americans should be ashamed of what our country has become. </p>

<p>The people, while they may have been in search of a better life, did not follow the laws to come here legally or broke the laws once they were here.

    <div class="md"><p>So do any of the current immigration plans being proposed in Congress right now punish corporations? I don&#39;t think they do and that&#39;s the problem. Its great that so many conservatives want sensible policies (though there&#39;s a sizeable amount who just flat out hate immigrants and would gladly see them all shot while crossing) but our government isn&#39;t on the same page. </p>

<p>Its wrong that thousands and thousands of people are dying trying to get into this country. Its wrong that we&#39;re putting thousands and thousands of children away in detainment facilities for indefinite amounts of time. I don&#39;t know what we can do to solve this but I think reforming immigration policy to make the process easier and faster is a good start. Maybe we should also start working with Mexico and other Central American countries and offering assistance and work on elevating them to our level so people there don&#39;t have to leave their homes. The current status quo is unacceptable and the solutions our government is putting forth aren&#39;t going to fix it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I mean I fundamentally disagree that America has a responsibility to let in anyone who wants in. Immigration could definitely use some reforms, I&#39;d like to see it fast-tracking skilled workers that are able to do jobs we need and are likely to integrate into American society. I&#39;m not going to try and change your view here as we likely have different ideas of what countries are and their main purpose, I&#39;m mainly trying to explain the conservative viewpoint. </p>

<p>There have been several proposals by right-wing congressmen pushing for nationwide e-verify which would make hiring illegals much more difficult. Unfortunately none have made it through. I think you may also be conflating GOPe with conservatives, when that is largely not the case. <a href="https://www.shrm.org/resourcesandtools/hr-topics/talent-acquisition/pages/trump-budget-mandatory-nationwide-everify-use.aspx">Here</a> is Trump&#39;s admin trying to get this through. Until this (or something like it) is through, any talk of punishments for companies is moot as there will be no basis for willful intent to hire an illegal alien. It&#39;s definitely a good first step to holding corporations that purposely hire illegals accountable. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t know of a single well known conservative that disapproves of all legal immigration, I&#39;m not sure where you&#39;re getting that from. Maybe some of the alt-right, and sure white supremacists, but those are not typical conservatives and most conservatives distance themselves from them. Conservatives tend to be in favor of constitutional law, and legal immigration is covered. Conservatives also tend to be in favor of the rule of law, and illegal immigration is a flagrant disregard for our laws and customs. </p>

<p>We are not going to be able to make significant changes in Mexico and Central America unless they give us free reign to stomp out the cartels and assist with their omnipresent corruption issues. Money we send them to help isn&#39;t going to go where we want it to, nothing short of military campaign will get those countries where they need to be. They are sovereign nations, so unless the decide to let us in we can&#39;t really fix their issues.  </p>

<p>There are issues with keeping children in the same holding facilities as adults. Also, in the walmart holding facility this post is about, only about 5% of the people in there were separated from their families. The other 95% were unaccompanied minors. I agree the current situation isn&#39;t ideal, but I don&#39;t know of a better solution. The amnesty loophole has been open for a long time and is an easy way to avoid the legal immigration process. Nothing was holding these people to actually appear at their court dates, and the percentage that followed the system was poor at best.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The asylum loophole slows down the deportation process by a lot. Whenever an illegal immigrant claims asylum, which they can do no matter their background, then they cannot be deported until they have had a trial to decide their asylum status.  </p>

<p>Ideally, I&#39;d see people crossing the border illegally sent back the same day. This is not possible do with the asylum process. Even though many will not be granted asylum, the can still claim it and slow down the process for the few that truly need it.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It would be a different story if this administration was continuing only placing unaccompanied minors in the camps, which is what the past administration was doing. Obviously you don&#39;t have much of a choice at that point and have to place them somewhere while you figure out what to do with them. </p>

<p>But this administration is  taking it one terrible step further. They&#39;re separating families that cross together. Not only that, some families being separated have come legally and turned themselves in asking for asylum (which is LEGAL). </p>

<p>It&#39;s awful that people are trying to justify it as a &quot;deterrent&quot; to prevent other families from crossing. It won&#39;t stop crossings, so it&#39;s just a gross human rights violation subjecting the kids to a bunch of traumatic shit for no reason. .</p>

<p>Also, obviously there will be people trying to take advantage of it. But it&#39;s still legal for them to ask for it, so they absolutely should not be separated from their family while the department looks into whether their claim is valid.</p>

<p>Also, it&#39;s a misdemeanor. If you are charged with a misdemeanor, you might be separated from your kids for a few hours while you&#39;re at the police station dealing with it (if you would even have to go there)... You wouldn&#39;t be apart for days/weeks/months.</p>

<p>It was Obama who locked them in <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/migrant-children-in-cages-2014-photos-explained-2018-5">cages</a>. It was Obama who <a href="https://mobile.nytimes.com/2016/07/18/opinion/mr-obamas-dubious-detention-centers.html">started</a> these camps.</p>

<p>Vast majority of these children came here by themselves. </p>
