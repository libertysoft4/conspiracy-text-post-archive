<p>It’s so baffling how different people are in real life vs the average person you come across through TV and social media.  The manipulation has to be so much more widespread than I previously thought was realistic.  </p>

<p>I get a lot of solace knowing most people are far more decent and reasonable than the snapshots and sound bites would have us believe.  All the more reason to judge based off your experience first and foremost.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>As someone who has been in IT for years... No, most people are bona fide idiots and assholes.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve had people in their 50s ask where the cord with three prongs goes.  They literally didn&#39;t know how to plug in an electrical cable.</p>

<p>Or, if you want examples of social skills, the people that have laughed at me when I fixed their problems. Because they said I was wrong and they knew it because their <em>husband</em> works in IT.</p>

<p>Or all the nurses and doctors with massive superiority complexes because they think IT people are beneath them, when they didn&#39;t know how to hit Restart from the start menu.</p>

<p>I could be here all night. I&#39;ve supported people from offices in person and from their homes as telephone tech support for a different company.</p>

<p>People aren&#39;t smarter than you think. They are far, far, <em>far</em> stupider and do not give a fuck about people around them, even the ones that just want to help.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah. Figures. Sorry to hear that. </p>

<p>I&#39;ve always figured it must be frustrating and a cruel irony for someone in an IT field - where things can be solved with an engineering approach to problem solving - to act as the point-man for addressing very human limitations and issues. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yea. Figures. Sorry to hear that. </p>

<p>At the same time, I think it might be important to remember that - if you are anything like me - you too are sometimes the one making the mindless little mistakes or stupid thoughtless gestures; if it&#39;s not as stupid as asking what the plug is for, it&#39;s leaving your trash behind because that&#39;s the minimum wage suckers job, or driving through that stale yellow which you know is actually a red, or even just taking a turn without shoulder checking and cutting off a pedestrian or a biker. </p>

<p>Most people have done something like this, and will do so in the future. But that&#39;s because most people are dealing with shit, just like you are, and trying to make due. Some of them do it because they really are that selfish and greedy and shitty, but the vast majority of them do it because they are distracted and have all the other shit they have to attend to on their mind. </p>

<p>And just like you forgive and forget yourself when you do stupid shit like that, you should still try and forgive the same behavior in others. Otherwise, jesus man, that&#39;s not a life. </p>

<p>Sorry for preaching. Wishing you the best. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have about a thousand on FB, a separate thousand on instagram, and about a hundred on twitter. The demographic is mostly 18-35 though. Most people online and IRL that you actually get to know are for a lot more than the labels and news media suggest. Common ground isn&#39;t hard to find, even with my right wing upper middle class friends. Most bots are just empty worthless arguments that end very quickly or lead to blocks/bans. Certainly there are people lumped into these groups that just parrot what they&#39;re reading above/below, but those people can be swayed in conversation/debate. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, if anything, I would say most people aren&#39;t exactly anti-conspiracy (althought the bad reputation we have doesn&#39;t help) by itself but rather apathetic for the most part and only become part of the circlejerk because of social pressure, but I&#39;m sure this could all be avoided if the control these people have in social media wasn&#39;t so huge. </p>

<p>I&#39;ve tried this out myself, if I become isolated enough from the usual &quot;echo chamber effect&quot; I can talk about even the most controversial conspiracy content with regular people and wake them up with almost no effort put into it. That&#39;s why we gotta do what we can to create a place that actually fights back against the brigading and rewards It&#39;s users for participating. <a href="https://www.saidit.net/">Make sure to check saidit out</a></p>

<p>Also yeah, we gotta call them out over here everytime we can. A lot of CIA agents and directors are jesuit trained and the CIA has a huge control over the media:</p>

<p>A typical work week in the U.S. consists of a variable amount of days and hours that usually consist of Monday - Friday, typically 7-8 am to 3-5 pm, and sometimes multiple shifts. Any weekend hours would consist of overtime and going over budget.</p>

<p>Yup.  Propaganda tends to focus on middle class vs. lower class. (Cops vs. inner-city blacks.  US job seekers vs. Illegal immigrants.  Birth control.  College debt. etc.)  Then there&#39;s identity politics that just splits the middle and lower classes completely across partisan lines.  Like Trans issues, kneeling for the anthem, climate change, etc.</p>

<p>Hmm, I wonder who has the means to push that type of propaganda to and benefits by keeping the middle class and lower class at odds.  Could it be the new plutocracy?  Nah, I&#39;m sure the mega rich are blissfully neutral on all this stuff.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is the selling point for why there should be more engagement by real people on social media. The other thing to think about is the way you write. Include links to back up your claims when you can, or provide links for others when they claim something that you know is true. We have to have each other&#39;s backs. Some people will dismiss a claim because they have no idea that proof is available.</p>

<p>For example, OP&#39;s post is about online shills. Some people don&#39;t know that there is a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/shills/comments/4kdq7n/astroturfing_information_megathread_revision_8/">mountain of proof</a> on this topic. This is in contrast to claims like <em>&quot;I can&#39;t believe you think there are secret agents arguing with you on the internet.&quot;</em></p>

<p>Given all of that information, it should be clear that we are being bombarded from many different angles, which means we need to be better at this. They can spend millions trying to propagandize a population to believe a falsehood, but all it takes is one well-placed comment with a citation to completely neutralize that propaganda for tens of thousands of people or more. We have the upper hand, we just have to use it. </p>
