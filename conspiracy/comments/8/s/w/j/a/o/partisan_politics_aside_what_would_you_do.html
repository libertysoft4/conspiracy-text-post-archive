<p>If you are reading this now PLEASE take off your partisan hats and conformation bias suits for one second and lets play a game of what would you do.</p>

<p><strong>Scenario</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>There are 1000s of children ages 4-16 that are currently being detained for entering the US illegally. </li>
<li>Overwhelming Majority of children being detained are either unaccompanied or with the company of people or person who you can not verify is the parent and or family member legally in charge of said minor.</li>
<li>Drug Cartels are known Human Traffickers who use fear to rule over those within their reach. </li>
<li>Making a mistake means sending a child into the hands of the Cartel who will sale them into the sex trade industry.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Sidenote:</strong>  This isn&#39;t a make believe scenario this is real . <a href="http://www.latimes.com/nation/la-na-border-patrol-dna-20180508-htmlstory.html">http://www.latimes.com/nation/la-na-border-patrol-dna-20180508-htmlstory.html</a></p>

<ol>
<li>You are in complete control and have the ability to choose any outcome you see fit.<br/></li>
<li>Explain what you would do and give your reasoning why your solution is best.</li>

<p>Im not 100&amp;#37; on the solution just yet.  Where im at right now it would look something like this.</p>

<ol>
<li>DNA Testing (Test ran for parents or guardians will be ran against current crime database.  If they pass clean the DNA would be demolished.) DNA Testing doesnt solve all the issues though.... For example mother kidnaps kid, Grandparents have legal custody and dad is trying to take them etc.</li>
<li>All Coyotes working for Cartel face Life in prison... ZERO SENDING THEM BACK.</li>

<p>That said, we gotta rule out DNA.  It&#39;s expensive, I don&#39;t think we easily have the resources for testing and it takes too much time.</p>

<p>Some of these kids are preverbal and don&#39;t even know how to say where they&#39;re from. How would you make sure you were sending the kids back to the right countries? Would you leave them with the government there to deal with or try to find a family member?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>We (the US) must accept the reality that Mexico will not change and take up their responsibility with the issues that arise from the border being completely open on their side.  We cannot immediately just ship these people back across the border because they will starve and be taken advantage of by the elements that they are usually trying to escape.  We can&#39;t also allow them to freely come here because they are not self sufficient and require aid from our social resources, which places undue responsibility on the established citizenry of this country.  The lot of us who are not dependent on the government already did not work hard and become self sufficient in order to become the financial backers of the worlds largest free hotel chain(with health care).  No other nation freely does this to their own people (well.... few maybe).  So, what we need is a proper legal system that allows immigration to happen smoothly but not at a rate that negatively impacts the overall health of the nation, and sufficient deterrence to keep people from sneaking past the borders without also causing major humanitarian issues.   I hate to say it but that deterrence should be a border that is practically impassible, and effective to the point that people stop trying to cross it.  Can such a thing be achieved?  I think so.  It will be costly however, to the point that we need major political move to get it done (this scenario says we would have it, so, yes).  It could be a series of walls and other barriers custom built for the terrain.  There will always be the case that people will try anyways, because they are more desperate than intelligent, and we will just rescue them and take them back to a port of ingress in Mexico far from the border and make sure they get put on the lowest list for legal immigration.  </p>

<p>Otherwise i would just like to reiterate that Mexico and the other governments of central and south america are really the ones to be blamed for this, but then I guess the real people to blame are the imperial Spanish who left the lands they raped in shitty shambles when their empire collapsed.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>We more or less do what we are doing now.  There is no foolproof system.  We do the best we can to make sure the kids are matched to their real parents, then we treat the parents as either criminals or refugees appropriately.  If the kids are without their parents, they are put into foster care unless their parents come to claim them, which at that time both will probably be deported.  The worst thing we can do is ship them by themselves back to Mexico.  People that decry that the administration or the INS/ICE/BP/DHS are the people at fault are missing the big picture.  These kids were victims first of the shitty countries they were born in, and then victims of their own parents who took the risk of transporting them across a dangerous country and a dangerous border without respecting the sovereignty and law of the country they desperately want to be a part of.  When we separate them from their parents, we are protecting them.  It&#39;s not wrong unless we never reunite them on purpose, or abuse them in the interim, which doesn&#39;t seem to be the case.</p>

<p>So if we fold Mexico into the US and make it a state how would deporting the illegal immigrants to that new state count as deporting them. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Honestly? I just though of a dozen little things that as an aggregate might work. I&#39;m a fan of deporting or incarcerating the criminals, and amnesty for the vast majority of hard working Mexicans/south Americans. Maybe some special schools: fundamentals, trade, and technical educatio to get them rapidly up to speed as a skilled class all their own? America thinks every dumb dick needs a Masters degree to be useful. There is a huge vacuum in technical/trade workers. They could plug this gap, maybe stimulate domestic manufacturing development at the same time.</p>

<p>But maybe the US should just take over Mexico. Remove the cartels and corrupt government, and fold their population into ours. US has such a fucking hardon for regime change, let&#39;s do it where it could benefit us directly.</p>

<p>Maybe these seem impractical, all I know is everything we have done regarding mexico since the 80s is fuxking retarded.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I dont have a clear understanding...there is too much spin.</p>

<p>If ICE really lost track of their parents(I do not believe this at all) we need to find them foster homes here immediately. I know exactly how bad the foster care situation is in the US. But I think the exposure this has might be leveraged to create new foster homes among decent people that normally would not think to do it.</p>

<p>If ICE <em>did</em> keep track of parents, DNA tests need to be run to make sure they are not being trafficked. Then either find, or start building, some housing here for the whole family... or deport. I would rather we do as I said in my 1st paragraph. But they are here illegally, and deporting is an option I won&#39;t object to. Detention for long periods makes no fuxking sense at all.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;d ask everyone in the world to write down their political affiliation at the top of a questionnaire. </p>

<p>Then I&#39;d ask them to briefly describe their political values in the middle of the questionnaire. </p>

<p>Next I&#39;d ask each individual to describe their personal values on the bottom half of the questionnaire (use voice to text for the illiterate).</p>

<p>Last, write their name in the bottom corner of the form. For verification purposes.</p>

<p>I&#39;d remove the top two thirds of the form (political bullshit), and document the overwhelmingly global value similarities of each, and every individual. </p>

<p>Share the results with the world; ensuring transparent public verification of the results. </p>

<p>Next, I&#39;d invite every individual to a global reunification open forum, where the public could meet (on line, or in person, cause it&#39;s getting crowded) to discuss policies that could be instituted to advance the human condition. </p>

<p>Global vote, on universal global policies.</p>

<p>6 rules: </p>

<p>1: Every policy must empirically proven to benefit society by means of double blind testing in each recognized country. 90% confirmation of evidence for acceptance.</p>

<p>2: Participants in the top 5% of economic wealth, can make policy suggestions; but do not get to directly vote on the policy. </p>

<p>3: All public or elected officials are subject to public recall votes within a people of 1 month (including appointees, etc.) Permanent rule. No exceptions.</p>

<p>4: Every person is guaranteed the universal right to vote. </p>

<p>5: Policies cannot be instituted that adversely affect any non-economic minority group. No rules against the poor. No rules against the rich. Etc. </p>

<p>6: Progressive taxation. The more you make, the higher rate of taxes you pay.</p>

<p>All enacted policies would have a mandated 
 sunset clause.  The majority would have to ratify, and reapproved each policy every 5 years. </p>

<p>Rinse, and repeat</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The children issue would be sorted out in hours with universal popular voting. Evidence: <a href="https://www.vox.com/2018/6/19/17479232/united-methodist-church-charges-expel-jeff-sessions-migrant">Jeff Sessions could be expelled from the Methodist Church over migrant policies</a>.   Problem solved.</p>

<p>The poor are disproportionally disadvantaged. A $100 speeding ticket is trivial to me. Annoying insurance rate hike. Maybe. But no significant impact on my overall quality of life. Vacations intact, etc. </p>

<p>I was raised by a widowed mother, and I have 3 brothers. $100 meant allot to my household.  Momma could stretch $100 a loooooong ways. A cooler packed with deli meat vs. peanut butter and jelly for a camping trip.</p>

<p>Amassing wealth is a buffer against adversity. The more you have the more secure your future is. The converse is double true.  </p>

<p>People&#39;s/families with resources can defend themselves. Rule#6 gives those who are less well defended a better opportunity for a optimistic future that they can earn. Rule#6 doesn&#39;t oppress the opulent. No business has ever turned down more business, cause it would raise his taxes. More business is universally more income.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>After WW2 the is government instituted progressive tax rates, where the most wealthy paid as much as a 90% tax rate. It made more sense to these wealthy elites to pay their top employees more for retention purposes. Additionally, more capital was invested in infrastructure, equip, etc., Resulting in more economic growth.</p>

<p>Economists don&#39;t like to investigate the assertion that I&#39;m going to next suggest, because of the existing nature of academic funding.  </p>

<p>Poor people generally don&#39;t have the resources to save much. Seems axiomatic to me. A popular that spends money, promotes economic growth.  Wealthy groups tend to save their money, also axiomatic. </p>

<p>Given the assumptions (which are close to axiomatic) if you were a Martian, would you choose to give greater tax breaks to the rich (who will likely hoard their wealth), or the poor (who will invest their resources in assets, and experiences, to enhance their lifestyle?</p>

<p>I&#39;m an investment Martian. -All ships rise with the tides.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I would deport them all and send them home with applications for the status they seek, whether asylum, work permit or resident status. If they are coming by land to the US from Mexico yet are from a different country, they are in violation of the 3rd country law concerning land borders-so far with all of the posts on immigration, I have not seen even 1 mention of this! I would keep accurate stats on the people before deporting, as US immigration should. </p>
