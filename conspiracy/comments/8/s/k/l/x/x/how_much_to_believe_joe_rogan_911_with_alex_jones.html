        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I’ve been on this sub for a while now, and i’ve just listened to the #911 Joe Rogan podcast with Alex Jones and Eddie Bravo, and it really made me question trump and the way the media portrays him. Up until I listened to this podcast I had been under the impression that most of the bad things MSM says about trump are at least mostly true, but I always took it with a grain of salt seeing how they seem to really demonize him. I am in no way, shape, or form defending Trump against anything, nor am I advocating for him.</p>

<p>My question being: does anyone know the legitimacy of the things Alex stated about Trump, and why the MSM would shill against him so hard? I am in no way trying to start an argument, just an open discussion as i’m genuinely misinformed and intrigued.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Alex basically goes on a rant about how the ‘elites’, the Clintons, and the Obama administration are part of a sort of cult that believes they are communicating with a 4th dimensional being. This being is telling them to build a machine that would eventually help them break off of what they believe is the current ‘failed civilization’, by dumbing down and killing off humanity(?). Alex says Trump knows about this to some extent, and does say a lot more than that about the situation, but in general they seem like such outrageous claims.</p>

<p>It makes you wonder if there’s any truth to some of what he says though, as he claims he has sources in the nsa, cia, etc.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Step one is to admit that you have been misinformed. The second step is to find what subjects interest you and find out what has been hidden from you.</p>

<p>It could be biology (epi-genetics and quantum biology), religion, physics, power-generation, transportation, ancient history, geology, medicine, food, politics.</p>

<p>The point is to keep an open mind, but not so open your brain falls out! And as one of the more trustworthy and honest researchers (William Cooper) once said, &quot;Don&#39;t trust anyone. Not even me! Look it up for yourself or you only think and do not know!&quot;</p>

<p>The journey is yours and I promise there are myriad rabbit holes to look down or to immerse yourself in completely. However, no one ever finds the big picture by staying in one hole (though they do often link together) - nor by trusting any one researcher/podcast/show.</p>

<p>Aristotle said it was the mark of a wise mind to be able to entertain an idea, without accepting/believing it.</p>

<p>Beware false paths: gate keepers, divide and conquer, shills, poisonous memes such as books written in allegory and metaphor <em>cough</em> Theosophy <em>cough</em> (it&#39;s the one world religion, it speaks of &quot;the return of the Atlantean Lords of the Flame to rule over man&quot; etc etc.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Great post!!!! As being someone who has just really started looking into theosophy could you point me to some critical viewpoints and critiques of it?

<p>Thanks</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Truthfully, aside from the current &quot;dark&quot; types of people who rely upon its teachings - I have no real &quot;critique&quot; - I looked into most of it, it&#39;s peppered throughout the new age/spiritual and ancient history/atlantis type podcasts and teachings.</p>

<p>It&#39;s pretty pervasive and when you look into its origins and what it&#39;s saying really resonates as undesirable to me.</p>

<p>One of the things that REALLY stood out to me, so much so I made a whole post about it <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/7nho9k/if_you_want_to_know_what_the_elite_believe/">here</a>, was the film &quot;The Hidden History of Humanity&quot; - by one Philip Lindsay (he was JUST on Forum Borealis recently and you can sort of feel the weird vibes from him, not &quot;proof&quot; I know, but see for yourself). In it they talk about &quot;root races&quot; and try to categorize people into &quot;levels of evolution&quot;  - the most startling (to me) was <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbWMw249xY8&amp;amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;amp;t=1h22m5s">this quote</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;We will explore the importance of Britain the United States and Brazil as a triangle of nations preparing us for the sixth root race ... and in 2025 the reappearance of the masters of wisdom for the first time since those ancient atlantean days ... and the expansion of human consciousness will go steadily forwards&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This &quot;idea&quot; posits that Brazilians will transition into the next new root race and supplant all current humans. This fits perfectly with the <a href="https://www.livescience.com/34228-will-humans-eventually-all-look-like-brazilians.html">&quot;everyone will look Brazilian&quot;</a> meme and the whole &quot;mixing everyone into one multicultural race&quot; thing going on.</p>

<p>Just food for thought, not necessarily damning evidence, but I get REALLY suspicious vibes from Theosophy.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thank you for the very in depth response. I&#39;m going to look into it for sure. Certainly a knife can be used to hunt, cut steak or kill people. That&#39;s the problem with us humans, it is so very easy to take something and bend, twist and mold it for personal gain or even nefarious puposes. </p>

<p>I just stated listening to Manley P Hall so he&#39;s about the extent of jniwledge I have right now. I did listen about the root races and honestly it did sound strange but I like to keep an open mind. </p>

<p>I guess what I&#39;m really intrigued by is the whole idea of spiritual alchemy by means of transforming one&#39;s self from the inside. I&#39;m not even sure if that is tied into Theosophy or not...lol.</p>

<p>I think it making logical sense is when you&#39;ve deep dived into many areas and basically given over your MIND to the possibility that anything is possible. You really must unlearn almost all of the stuff you&#39;ve been taught from birth. Fascinating stuff!!!!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s tough, you got to find where you stand.  I default to &quot;trust no one&quot;.  Personally, following the Bernie campaign really removed the wool from my eyes in regards to MSM/DNC/Hillary/Online-Shill-Campaigns.  So that became the new center for where I would stand.  And if the crazy Alex Jones and Trump speak out against corrupt opposition or get slandered by the MSM, then I start feeling that maybe there&#39;s some truth on their side, because there sure as hell doesn&#39;t seem to be any on the MSM side.</p>
