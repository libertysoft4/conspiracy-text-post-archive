    <div class="md"><p>Oh trust me, there&#39;s a lot of gaslighting here.</p>

<p>There are actual people out there with limited resources, building case-files, asking questions, searching communities, building search parties- etc. Investigators... detectives... people who actually dedicate their lives to saving any child who may be in danger of being harmed or exploited, who have to sit down and infiltrate those illegal spaces-</p>

<p>I remember reading the book &quot;One Child At Time&quot; years ago, even before I ever discovered reddit or r/conspiracy, and the book details what it means to have a job as an officer who actually dedicates their livelihood to stopping pedophiles who are exploiting children and saving those who are currently victimized... It&#39;s not &quot;exciting&quot; &amp; it&#39;s not a conspiracy... it&#39;s real fucking life. They see horrible images and it&#39;s just.. it&#39;s not a plaything. It&#39;s really not.</p>

<p>but somehow gabbing about the fact that it&#39;s happening and saturating this particular forum and our minds day in, day out, is doing something.</p>

<p>No one is out here encouraging people to volunteer for neighborhood watch, or to check their regional registered list of sex offenders- not sharing a patreon for someone actually doing investigation into these matters- no... I don&#39;t see any of that... because at this point somehow they believe we still are not aware.</p>

<p>I just... I&#39;m over this very serious, very emotionally draining and demanding topic being used as just another headline, just something else for clicks.... sorry for the rant. I&#39;m just done with the bullshit. I&#39;m over it.</p>

<p>Are you serious? Did you not see the countless posts on Tucson and people supporting the people who claim to actually be out  there on the ground, trying to make a difference? Tons of people encouraging donations (of supplies, not money) to their cause and what not. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Good points. One day I was driving past a school by my house, at the worst time because school had just gotten out. Anyway, I see this man pulling along this little girl, around 12, and just had a sense that she was uncomfortable. So I turn off my turn signal I had on and start heading over to him but I&#39;m blocked in by school traffic. The guy sees me staring at him trying to get to him and runs off. All of this happening a block away from this expensive catholic school and none of the parents/ teachers notice a thing. I mean, I wouldn&#39;t expect many parents to notice as they were focused on picking up their kids, but none of them? Anyway, it&#39;s too bad that nobody driving would give me any space (not that they knew what I was doing) because the guy got away and read in the news the same guy raped a woman later that night. The other crazy thing is the police just reported the incident as stalking, I would have thought attempted kid napping and/or attempted rape because he was trying to bring her to his van.</p>

<p>Okay. I’m with you so far. Their response could be better. I would rather they address it than cover up. But isn’t removing the talk better than leaving it up?</p>

<p>I’m no expert on the program but right from their home page:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>At TEDx events, a screening of TED Talks videos — or a combination of live presenters and TED Talks videos — sparks deep conversation and connections at the local level. TEDx events are planned and coordinated independently, under a free license granted by TED. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>I’d need to know what goes into getting one of those licenses. Do you?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>need to own up that they are pushing this garbage, as they have been pushing plenty of unscientific social justice garbage for years now.</p>

<p>Ahh okay now I see why you have a problem. Care to show any actual Ted talks that have been discredited? </p>

<p>My point was that someone who holds... Unsavory views about minorities and women are likely to go express them online among communities such as the ones above that will validate their views.

<p>Most of those subs aren&#39;t literally about Nazism, but their beliefs/morals are pretty similar.</p>

<p>However, there is also <a href="/r/natsoc">/r/natsoc</a> and <a href="/r/mussolini">/r/mussolini</a> on that list, so clearly they have at least a couple of subreddits left.</p>

<p>It&#39;s propaganda to claim they were left wing, let&#39;s ask Hitler what he thinks about the left and right:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>There are only two possibilities in Germany; do not imagine that the people will forever go with the middle party, the party of compromises; one day it will turn to those who have most consistently foretold the coming ruin and have sought to dissociate themselves from it. And that party is either <strong>the Left: and then God help us! for it will lead us to complete destruction - to Bolshevism, or else it is a party of the Right which at the last, when the people is in utter despair, when it has lost all its spirit and has no longer any faith in anything, is determined for its part ruthlessly to seize the reins of power - that is the beginning of resistance of which I spoke a few minutes ago.</strong> Here, too, there can be no compromise - there are only two possibilities: either victory of the Aryan, or annihilation of the Aryan and the victory of the Jew.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Nothing says &quot;I hate capitalism and I&#39;m a leftist&quot; quite like imprisoning and murdering all the leftists and trade union bosses and then banning unions.</p>

<p>Hitler turned the leftists of Germany (the not-national-just-regular socialists, the communists, trade union leaders) into slave labour for companies like Krupp or Hugo Boss.</p>

<p>That&#39;s just the economic side, ignoring the extreme nationalism and traditionalism (to the point of removing women from the work force) and most importantly the fact they were pro-hierarchy and pro-private property, which are the common characteristics of all right-wing ideologies and mutually exclusive with left wing ideologies.</p>

<p>That&#39;s completely ridiculous. No society can function without hierarchies. Are you going to try and tell me Stalin didn&#39;t have hierarchies? Hitler murdered rivals, just like Stalin did. At least leftists admit Stalin was far leftist. The only difference between Hitler and Stalin is that Hitler kept around the bosses when he nationalized everything, and Stalin killed off the bosses and put his own buddies in control. It&#39;s a difference without a difference. Hitler kept the upper crust, Stalin created a new upper crust. Either way, they had privileged people.</p>

<p>Don&#39;t talk to me about leftist idealism. They always talk about classless societies (whether it&#39;s a cynical power-grab or they really believe it), but it can&#39;t work that like, and it <em>always</em> turns into authoritarianism with a privileged class. See Venezuela for the latest example.</p>

<p>Society&#39;s POV is still subjective, though.  What may be good for &quot;society&quot; may be bad for a specific individual, again, because it depends on perspective.

They bend to fear and pain and fall for reward and then end up making up the loss of emotional energy and alleviatinf the feeling of powerlessness by making others feel the same way, powerless and drained by fear and pain. They displace their emotional energy of correction created by their oppressors onto new victims and in doing so serve their oppressors.</p>

<p>These beings are running this planet secretly through our elites. They do it for the emotional energy and for reproduction of their demonic life cycle. They want to convert us into them after a long period of abusive experiences. Ideally, we blame what we cannot change and/or life itself for our poor situation, not the disease that covertly brought it. As we perceive that life sucks, we become an agent making it suck.

    <div class="md"><p>The problem that none of you notice is that you focus on the “intellectual philosophy” of the occurrence more than the occurrence itself. The focus moves away from pedophilia as it is and onto isms like “relativity”, when that shouldn’t matter too much in the first place unless you’re writing a thesis. I wonder if it’s a psychological trick. </p>

<p>Chromosome abnormalities are not caused by malnutrition (although of course that can lead to many other problems including retardation). They can be caused by toxicity, such as exposure to insecticides, but in most cases, they just happen, and always have. It is very natural.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think there needs to be better distinction between: natural, normal, and acceptable/desirable.</p>

<p>Is it natural for little boys to get in playground fights?  Absolutely.  Is it normal?  I would say that it&#39;s rare for most people, so probably not normal, but it&#39;s not super rare.  You could probably argue that it is normal because we all know someone who&#39;s done it or seen it happen.  Is it acceptable?  Most people would probably say it&#39;s not the best option.</p>

<p>With regards to retardation or homosexuality or trans, I think it&#39;s definitely within the realm of possibility that some group of people could be dumping stuff in the water or food supply or chemtrails or whatever and changing the likelihood of children becoming retarded, homosexual or trans or whatever.  We should address those factors, but that doesn&#39;t mean that the retard/homosexual/trans person is bad, but rather that the actions people are taking that shift the probability curves are bad.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>But when you were going through puberty, did you ever worry about getting an erection at the beach because of all the half naked women?  Have you ever chosen not to look at the half naked women, because you might come off as creepy or others in your company might not appreciate your wandering gazes.</p>

<p>I&#39;m definitely not convinced by her arguments that pedophilia is an innate, genetic, sexual preference.  I think there&#39;s a lot of socialization type influences that can lead people into a variety of sexual preferences, but once someone is a pedophile does it really matter where it came from?</p>

<p>I think you are totally correct in making the distinction between sexual urges and violating other people sexually.  As a heterosexual man, that doesn&#39;t rape people, I feel that we are at a time period, where we acknowledge that not all men are rapists.  We say this in theory, but as a society we are hyper sensitive to any claims of rape or assault and immediately assume that the man is guilty just at the accusation.  We are definitely more likely to assume that the man is a rapist than to assume that the women is lying.  If you go to youtube, you can type in &quot;Metoo&quot; and half the stuff is about the Metoo movement going too far, or being a witch hunt, or non-rapist men trying to protect themselves from being accused, or MGTOW.  As men, as no-rapists, there&#39;s plenty of us that are concerned about what could happen to us, even though we&#39;ve done nothing wrong or harmed anybody, because all it takes is an accusation.  If you&#39;re going through a divorce, there&#39;s plenty of lawyers that will recommend that the woman try to suggest that you physically harmed her or the kids, because the accusation is so damning.</p>

<p>I think in both pedophiles and heterosexuals, we need to not punish people who&#39;ve done nothing wrong, while helping people who are a risk of injuring others to redirect those thoughts in a non-harmful manner.</p>

<p>fair to say the Tromovitch view does not represent majority academic opinion. It’s likely, too, that some of the academic protests against the “stigmatisation” of paedophiles are as much a backlash against the harshness of sex offender laws as anything else. Finally, of course, academic inquiry is supposed to question conventional wisdom and to deal rigorously with the evidence, whether or not the conclusions it leads you to are popular.</p>

You think tedx will be the only ones to do this you’ll start seeing this increasing more in the media. the elites want pedophilia to be a norm but they had to get homosexuality and transsexuals as a norm first so they can start approaching this. None of you can stop it , eventually it’s gonna be considered legal. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>She&#39;s suggesting that we can reduce child sexual abuse by not ostracizing pedophiles. It&#39;s not difficult to see why this might be the case:
* Pushing it to the underground means they will only find solace with other pedophiles, thus creating networks of abusers.
* Pedophiles are less likely to seek council and advice from people who will actually give them good advice, for fear of backlash.
* They are less likely to care about what society thinks of them when they are preemptively ostracized. Less to lose so more likely to commit abuse.
A lot of you are reacting like she is actually encouraging sexual abuse.</p>

With any taboo subject, the amount of people who are a danger to other people, is smaller than the amount of people who are attracted to the taboo or fetish.  Most humans can filter their thoughts enough to prevent harming other people.  By your standards everyone could be locked up, because we all have thoughts that are inappropriate float throughour heads, whether they&#39;re our own, empathically received from others, or implanted from one of the many mind control technologies out there.</p>

<p>And not all child abusers are pedophiles. There are rapists and molesters out there who do not fantasize about children and seek them out. But if the opportunity to abuse one comes up, they will take it, just as they would happily rape an unconscious woman or the smaller man who is their cell mate in prison.</p>

<p>This is the issue in our messed-up world: we have pedophiles who do not hurt children and nonpedophiles who do. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>So, would you be against a system that registered all currently existing child pornography videos, anybody caught making a new one would instantly get the death penalty, same for people who actually abuse children, but all currently created CP videos would be available  via some government website?</p>

<p>The government would then have a way to easily identify and track pedos, it would probably make it easier to identify and take down CP rings as well, as most of their &quot;clientele&quot; wouldn&#39;t want to risk going for something illegal when an easy alternative is available.</p>

<p>Only downsides I can see are a possible increase in pedophilia if the gov website is public, but that could be solved with it requiring some form of psychiatric assessment to get access? and then you&#39;re on-record for being a pedophile, which is probably a good thing, we&#39;d be able to keep all of the people who watch child porn away from places with children.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, yeah, it still gives the pedos child porn for a while, though.</p>

<p>One of their &quot;honeypots&quot; actually became like 100x more popular after they took over, with more views  during the time the CIA was operating it than the former operators, due to the fact that they could afford more bandwidth.</p>

<p>The system I&#39;m talking about would make making CP vids not as lucrative, hopefully reducing child abuse/trafficking.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t see anything wrong with giving them CP as long as we can stamp out the making of more. I&#39;m sure that there&#39;s enough in the CIA stash that we could do it, but the question is whether people care more about punishing pedos or helping children.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Pushing it to the underground means they will only find solace with other pedophiles, thus creating networks of abusers.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Doesn&#39;t this viewpoint presume that pedophiles are abusers?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Pedophiles are less likely to seek council and advice from people who will actually give them good advice, for fear of backlash.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If only there were some decentralized information search tool that would allow people to find information anonymously.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>They are less likely to care about what society thinks of them when they are preemptively ostracized. Less to lose so more likely to commit abuse.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So pedophiles need society&#39;s approval in order to not commit abuse?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think long story short the reason why more and more pedophiles act every day is because we don’t tend to them; we punish them with little to no rehabilitation , slap a label on them, and forget  about them/barely keep an eye on them. Then we wonder why we produce more repeat offenders, and if you ask me , produce more pedophiles because of some of the points this person makes.
Something to think about for sure because clearly our supposedly ever improving systems dont seem to be managing the issue at all.</p>

<p>more and more pedophiles act every day</p>

<p>Is this actually true? </p>

<blockquote>
<p>is because we don’t tend to them</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Nope. The video says pedophiles are not criminals until they act. True. But committing that act is their choice. It is not our fault. Putting the blame on us is counterproductive to rehabilitation and treatment because it allows the abuser to believe they are innocent of the crime of child abuse.</p>

The emphasis here is still on healing though, and people with violent fantasies aren&#39;t treated as criminals the same way pedophiles are.

    <div class="md"><p>I think the generally agreed upon best approach for dealing with pedophilia is therapy. As for your pill argument, I don&#39;t think that&#39;s the case. It might be rather interesting, in fact... particularly if there were also pills to invoke bisexuality in people, or homosexuality in heterosexual people. Could be used as a recreational drug, to try something new and enjoy more of the experiences that life as a human being has to offer. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t believe any of this bullshit, sorry. Ostracizing pedophiles is not what causes children to get abused. It&#39;s not normal people&#39;s fault that pedophiles abuse children. Not in one single case is this true. If anyone&#39;s interest in sexualizing children is high enough that they&#39;d mention it to anyone, i WANT them on a registry. I WANT to be able to find that out. If they can keep a lid on it their whole life, fine, that&#39;s <em>good practice</em> for not acting on something. Encouraging any sort of self expression on the topic is not. </p>

Just because someone has done wrong does not mean we should condemn them, we must make a persistent effort to rehabilitate them in a way which is generally considerate of the fact that no human is born trying to hurt people they are conditioned by their environments and peers.
Yes, I understand they are personally responsible for their actions hence the necessity for punishment and rehabilitation but right now we mostly focus on punishment which is a deterrent in its own right however that system stands for improvement.

<p>Sounding a bit spiritual, there! You&#39;re talking to a traditionalist Catholic. Don&#39;t worry, i know the distinction between judging souls and judging actions. Admitting one is a pedophile is a bold action. I don&#39;t like my pedophiles making bold actions. Fantasies, too, are an <em>action.</em> If someone is refusing to shut down their sick fantasies and <em>then go so far as to talk about it</em> they&#39;re not exercising enough restraint for me to trust them in society. Notice how I&#39;m not suggesting we send troops out interrogating everyone on whether they have any buried pedophilic predilections that they&#39;re aware of?  That&#39;s because I&#39;m not judging <em>people</em>, I&#39;m judging <em>the action</em> of letting your pedophilia grow too big for the dungeons of the psyche that it should be imprisoned in. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Traditional catholic lol, you have your fair share of pedophilia in your community to deal with so I can understand your stance.
I hear you and I have had a similar stance before for criminals but Jeffery Dahmer probably had a rough upbringing and environment. I hold fast in believing that if we had intervened at a young age and put some love and maybe some faith into him things would’ve turned out differently. I cant say for sure, some people walk that path, however I do know I wish we had done more to help someone like that because we lost multiple valuable lives to him. At the end of it all he practically got what he deserved if you wanna put it that way.
Thanks for the discussion. </p>

Pedophilia is an uncontrollable sexual affection towards children. If you like chicks with brown hair, theres nothing you can do about it, if you like dudes instead of titties, theres not much you can do about it either... and same goes for if you were born having a sexual affection towards children. It is absolutely wrong to blame the person for having this affection. Blame the action, not the affection. Read up on this <a href="https://www.dont-offend.org/">here</a> or ask any psychologist/psychotherapist.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>What if someone told you that because you had the urge to beat the life out of multiple people that you&#39;ve never met that you were a sociopath that needed to be locked away from society forever?</p>

<p>Your way of thinking actually promotes acts of pedophilia towards children. </p>

<p>Let me ask you this: Did you choose to be attracted to men/women or whatever you&#39;re attracted to? No. </p>

<p>Now we&#39;ll go on the basis that pedophiles DO NOT CHOOSE to be attracted to children and that they were born with it. You have two options:</p>

<p>Option 1: Condemn all pedophiles, whether they acted on it or not. If someone admits that they are attracted to children they automatically become imprisoned. Now you have incentivezed pedophiles to hide and plot. Even those who want to seek help won&#39;t. You&#39;ve effectively forced pedophiles to go into hiding while their lust and attraction brews until a few snap and rape children.</p>

<p>Option 2: You create awareness that pedophile is a MENTAL ILLNESS that needs to be addressed and treated. You make it known that acting on pedophilic urges is NOT OKAY AND THAT IF THEY DO THEY WILL BE LOCKED UP. You offer rehabilitation and coping mechanisms so that they don&#39;t act on pedophilic urges. If you normalize that pedophilia is a mental illness that can be treated, pedophiles no longer need to hide. They can be identified, they can be monitored, they can be treated. Furthermore you can catch pedophilia early on since younger and younger pedophiles will feel comfortable admitting they have pedophilia and we can treat it at the root. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Its not saying pedophilia is normal it said it occurs in 60 million people throughout the world. So not normal not common. However she did say that it isnt a choice. That there&#39;s a difference between having the desire and acting out on it and that the most likely way a pedophile acts out is due to isolation. Essentially she&#39;s saying it&#39;s a problem that&#39;s not going away so we need to address it in new ways to prevent child abuse. So being more accepting that pedophilia isn&#39;t a choice and that actually abusing a child is= acceptance of pedophilia as a unchangeable sexual orientation, less stigma more likely for a pedophile to get help and not harm any children</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know what the solution to the problem of pedophilia. Fear mongering a video merely talking about the issue isnt a solution.</p>

Rehabilitation aims to normalize a way of thought or behavior so that the individual can find acceptance in themselves and create barriers to certain subsets of behavior.  That&#39;s why modern psychology rejects actual blame and instead treats behaviors as illnesses.  The normalization and social acceptance of the pedophiliac thought is an atrocity of the highest order.  And don&#39;t bother saying that isn&#39;t happening.  It most absolutely is.  </p>

<p>I feel like the issue is important so further steps need to be taking to address it. In fact YOU suggest that we do nothing, allow pedophiles to hide and rape in anonymity, never to be treated.<br/>
That&#39;s absurd.  I never suggested doing nothing.  Socially ostracizing, physical castration, isolation in mental hospitals, and execution are all fine with me.  </p>

<p>Your hatred for pedophiles contributes to the continue rape of children today. If you can rehabilitate even one pedophile you would have saved children, yet you choose to demonize the very thought of rehabilitation itself.<br/>
You are absolutely insane.  Acceptance of pedophilia will stop pedophilia but disgust of pedophilia will spread pedophilia.  God in heaven I hope you have no actual authority over anything to do with this.  </p>

How sanctimonious of you.</p>

<p>When a drug addict goes to rehab his behavior is not okay. But rehab aims to prevent his use of drug after admitting that his behavior is a problem.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>That&#39;s why modern psychology rejects actual blame and instead treats behaviors as illnesses. The normalization and social acceptance of the pedophiliac thought is an atrocity of the highest order. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes because pedophilia ISNT A CHOICE, just like homosexuality or heterosexuality. No one wakes up one day and thinks to themselves &quot;I think today I am going to get a boner at the though of children.&quot; They are born with it.</p>

<p>You are hung up on the term &quot;acceptance&quot; and &quot;normalizaiton&quot; when you don&#39;t even know what it means. We ACCEPT that pedophilia is not a choice and that these people need help. We DO NOT ACCEPT child rape. </p>

<p>When you NORMALIZE pedophilia it does NOT mean &quot;Oh yeah pedophiles are cool people and should do whatever you want.&quot; You NORMALIZE it in the same way you normalize schizophrenia &quot;This is a problem that is detrimental to you and everyone around you. You did not choose this but you must get help.&quot;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>That&#39;s absurd. I never suggested doing nothing. Socially ostracizing, physical castration, isolation in mental hospitals, and execution are all fine with me.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Ahh yes, what Jesus would have done. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>You are absolutely insane. Acceptance of pedophilia will stop pedophilia but disgust of pedophilia will spread pedophilia. God in heaven I hope you have no actual authority over anything to do with this.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You are still hung up on your emotions once again and have defaulted to emotionally lashing out at me. </p>

<p>Your emotional outburst are so great that you still have not understood the crux of the argument since you are blinded by rage.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Acceptance of pedophilia will stop pedophilia but disgust of pedophilia will spread pedophilia. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Exhibit B: Not understanding the argument because you are controlled by your emotions.</p>

<p>You have hung up your emotions on the word &quot;acceptance&quot; as if we are saying &quot;pedophilic thoughts are acceptable and should be celebrated.&quot; We are not. We are saying pedophilia should be accepted as a mental disorder so that pedophiles can be treated.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>God in heaven I hope you have no actual authority over anything to do with this.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Fortunately, I do. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>How sanctimonious of you.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Thank you. I pray that one day you will also seek help. Judging by a cursory look at your comment history you have a lot of hate in your heart. Many of your ideas are things that Jesus would not like. </p>

<p>Have a blessed life. </p>

</blockquote>

<p>Your rage is still clouding your ability to comprehend the word &quot;accept&quot; and &quot;pedophilia&quot;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Jesus advocated drowning those who harm children so I guess I&#39;ll add that to my list.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No he didn&#39;t. He said &quot;But whoever causes one of these little ones who BELIEVE IN ME TO SIN, it would be better for him to have a great millstone fastened around his neck and to be drowned in the depth of the sea.&quot;</p>

<p>Not only did he say that, but he uses this same wording when he talks about Gehenna and how it is better for men to cut their hands/gouge their eyes etc. which is widely interpreted to not be literal.</p>

<p>Jesus also said you should forgive others &quot;not unto thee, Until seven times: but, Until seventy times seven.&quot; seventy times seven being the idiom of that time period for UNLIMITED forgiveness.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Pedophilia is a choice</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If you believe that you can turn on your boner to children at will then I am actually concerned that YOU may be a pedophile. I will also pray for your children/future children if you have any.</p>

<p>The other way around you idiot. A friend of mine was molested by her uncle and her family would believe it because they couldn&#39;t belive that one of theirs was *a monster*. Almost *all* child molestation happens within the family. That is the truth. And another truth: People won&#39;t easily believe that their father, brother, moter, sister is a pedophile. They will look away. </p>

<p>*If* you are really about protecting the innocent you draw a sharp line at the act, and you do what ever you can too help pedophiles not to act on their desire. That way you can actually help pedophiles and save children from being molested. And if you would have ever spend a single moment talking with experts about this topic you wouldn&#39;t go around being an asshole. Your position is a massive part of the problem. </p>

All your opinion does is letting pedophiles know that they are all alone and monster and guess what usually happens next: some of them start behaving like monsters. </p>

<p>Anything but that. I just know that there is no abolute truth, and that there are very few *absolute* evils. And that human beings, given the choice, can often be brought to go down the way of least pain. </p>

<p>Please go, read the wikipedia article on General Butt Naked. One of the most adhorend people to ever roam this planet abnd he thinks that he is a good person. *That* is a truth. And that is what we should learn sooner or later. </p>

<p>&gt; Pedophilia isn&#39;t an illness.  It&#39;s a choice that&#39;s made to gratify an  evil desire.  It&#39;s a tumor that grows into the mind of a man or woman  and needs cut out, not coddled. </p>

<p>And that is where you are wrong. That is where your inability to accept the truth will harm you and your family. Your conventient excuse makes you blind. Just like it made the family of my friend blind. </p>

<p>&gt; Yes, I have kids. And no, they won&#39;t be pedophiles.  We discuss deviant  behaviors and the traumatic effects inflicted by evil individuals. </p>

<p>brilliant. Now, if they realize that they had pedophilic urges they will be afraid to talk to you because you would assume that they are evil. And a possible cycle of pain starts again. Because you choose to believe a convenient lie.</p>

<p>&gt; My children know that they will be protected from evil-hearted people, from without and from within our family. </p>

<p>How can you protect them if you teach them your moral code as if it would be the absolut moral code? </p>

<p>You won&#39;t be around forever and you don&#39;t know everthing. </p>

<p>PS: Sorry if I am too offensive but I can&#39;t stand seeing pain and being absolutely unable to do anything. And I&#39;m none of those satisfied by revenge or *justice*. If we want to live in a better world we have to find ways to include all of our members. And every human being ostracized by society will stay blind for society. We&#39;ve tried this long enough and it didn&#39;t change a thing - let&#39;s hear what those who actually study the effects and reasons have to say and maybe, just maybe we will reach a better solution.</p>

<p>done. Altough I&#39;m sorta curious why <a href="/u/Thekidseateverthing">/u/Thekidseateverthing</a> post (where he calls pedophiles cancer) and my answer where I call his/hers behavior cancer is acceptable but calling someone an idiot isn&#39;t. It sorta would be nicer to be too dumb to understand something than knowing the harmful consequence and doing it regardless. If you take away the idiot all that stands is intentionally malicious behaviour and that is (in my book) sorta worse..</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Why are people disagreeing with this? The &quot;thoughts not acts&quot; spiel just shows how much people do not understand their own brains. Thoughts change you just as much as actions do. Repeated thoughts like these can permanently damage you into becoming one of these husks of humanity, and they invite that damage themselves. Your thoughts matter A LOT. Kind of related to this is why so many people are &quot;depressed&quot; recently. This is because they do not focus on their base joys like the taste of their food, the beauty of art and nature, and fascinating conversations. People instead focus on how bad they look today or how unprepared they are for their exams. There are many ways to look at everything and viewing pedophiles as &quot;misunderstood&quot; and &quot;needing help&quot; is just a way for evil to lay their foundation in your mind.</p>

<p>How is asking a question (&quot;Do they want society to accept them being prideful of being a pedophile?&quot;) presumptuous of anything? I&#39;m seeking to be informed, on what precisely people want -- as you and the speaker in this YouTube video are offering no solutions to what isn&#39;t even an issue. You&#39;re just wailing on a soapbox about how there are some people that act irrationally and murder.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>No, but the ones who have never done anything wrong would be seriously hurt or killed if anyone ever found out.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Some people in society are bad, and murder people -- got it! Thanks for the insight!</p>

<p>And what will happen to anyone who kills a pedophile, or anyone at all? </p>

<p>They get charged with murder.</p>

<p>What else do you want to happen to them?</p>

<p>Do you genuinely believe that someone that even considers the act of murder can somehow be &quot;swayed&quot; to all of a sudden be empathetic to pedophiles? If so, how?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>People want to fucking kill you, and take away any and all rights from you because they already found you guilty.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Some people want to fucking kill you and take away any and all rights from you because you look at them the wrong way. What&#39;s your point?</p>

<p>Pedophiles have more access than ever to private treatment. Again, what else do you want? Society to all of a sudden stop having people be murderous? That would be nice! But again, you&#39;re just on your soapbox with no solutions, just like this speaker.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The majority of comments in this thread are proof.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Reddit comments represent a small sample size, to the point where you&#39;d be naive to regard a single thread as context of society at large.</p>

<p>Additionally, the most upvoted comments in this thread are similar to yours (slamming the very small portion of society that wants to murder someone and convict them without due process), so I don&#39;t know what you&#39;re on about. If you look at any Reddit thread, there are always a few instances of terrible people, downvoted to oblivion. That doesn&#39;t say anything about how society generally views something.</p>

<p>Also, I didn&#39;t downvote you. Neurotic, much?</p>

<p>I agree there is a push in the Hellywood media to normalize pedophilia, but people have the right to discuss different ways of dealing with the problem as this young lady does.  She has more of the left-wing / European approach to problems, which is the &quot;let&#39;s be understanding, being harsh does more harm than good&quot; approach.  </p>

<p>It is their same approach to all crime, such as the almost luxury prisons found in Scandinavia.   </p>

    <div class="md"><p>No but that would fall under bad idea. Having &quot;relations&quot; with someone who does not want it or if they are a minor damages people and families. Its a bad choice. If they dont see that as a bad choice its because people are just a means to an end for their own will. Wether its for sexual pleasure or not is not the factor. identifying other peoples sovereignty as something you can manipulate in ANY way is sinister. You see someone with a sexual problem, i see a person who feels there sexual needs matter more than the rest of humanitys wants/needs. I want to do cocaine everyday and honestly never work again. But i cant claim my wants which are pleasure chasing based instincts matter more than my families life or my own cintributions to the world. People are compulsive, damaged, and frantically looking for a way to feel how they &quot;want&quot; inside regardless of consequences. I dont think that is a reason to create a new illness or pathology for every weird quirck or behavior. Some of these mental health issues are PURELY related to will power, self control, and a persons ethics and they dont want to fight back against that voice in their head that tells them to get what they want. I see a girl i want to have sex with? If i dont get consent i cant claim im ill, and the age/gender shouldent matter in this. Are we going to believe that the the reason they are attracted to kids is chemical then murder should be seen the same way. It should be seem as i have a chemical imbalance because people dont matter to me. That would imply because i think different than the common people that my whole brain must be different. Its covering up the truth that people can just be fucked up by their own ideas and choices and some of the time.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>One possible definition of illness is you/and or others suffer from the way you are. That is why there is a illness called anti-social personality disorder (aka psychopaths) which describes just what you said - people that lack empathy and sometimes have an urge to kill/murder animals and people (in very few words). The question really is how much control over their own urges people with such personality disorders and also pedophiles have. If there was no control whatsoever then there wouldn&#39;t be any use in punishment - we&#39;d have to find another way, like putting someone away for good. If there is control and you don&#39;t want to follow your urges there should be a opportunity for help. And that help is mental health professionals. </p>

<p>As a father i completely understand the anger/fear/aggression that comes from the thought of someone advancing a/our kids but I hope that anyone with such urges gets help so they never act out on it. </p>

<p>By the way, illnesses aren&#39;t created but patterns of behaviour are named, these behaviours are already there. By accepting or declining these as illness (in US the APA does that, in the rest of the world the WHO) we accept that we recognise the need to treat the pattern. That way homosexuality was taken out of the index (sadly not earlier than the 80s) - pedophilia was in there for a long time. It is nothing new...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There are no thought crimes you are correct. And you can seek help if you feel that you are in danger of committing an act that is illegal. And mental health professionals practice confidentiality, but have a duty to protect if the individual has direct/exact plans of the crime or names specific people. </p>

<p>However, the spectrum of sexual fetishes/sexualities are great. They can range from having a balloon fetish which ultimately isn&#39;t harmful to anyone, all the way to pedophilia which involves recipients (victims) of these acts. </p>

<p>Society&#39;s wellbeing out weighs an individual&#39;s. And because of this these acts that harm others (rape, pedophilia, necrophilia) will always be addressed as a criminal act before anything else.</p>

<p>With that being said, treating sexual problems from balloon fetish to pedos is very difficult and usually yields little to no positive results. Fetishes are like an addiction and people either replace the addiction for another less harmful one or end up trying and reverting back to the original behavior. So for someone to seek  counseling about them having pedo thoughts or urges only raises a red flag and causes the provider to act on their duty to protect.  </p>

<p>For anyone that supports it, you obviously don’t have children. If you do, then you let me know if you would let them watch your children and not even ONCE be worried. </p>

<p>Pure human trash. There’s a reason they fear prison. Even the worst of society looks down upon the pitiful excuse of life for someone who harms a child.</p>

<p>Sorry for the rant, but any defense of this for a “Forward way of thinking” is literally no defense at all. Trash, no more conversation. Pretty soon murder will be “an urge” we have respect. Society needs a huge self correct generation. I think the worst part is we have yet to figure out which generation is pushing. Is madness.</p>

It’s taken a lot of love and compassion to try and help my spouse, get over something they had no control over. I don’t care how uncompassionate it sounds, pedophiles should be executed. No amount of therapy or counseling is going to fix them. I have absolutely NO sympathy for these predators. They destroy the lives of their victims in every sense of the word. They should be put in front of a firing squad and killed. They deserve zero tolerance. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Maybe, or quit putting pedophiles in protected custody and let the other inmates handle the problem. Either way there is no rehabilitating these people. They get caught go to prison then in most cases get out and attack again. Pedophila has no place in human society, just like rape, murder, and cannabilism. I for one don’t believe they deserve to live. Murder carries a death sentence, I believe pedophiles deserve the same. Why should we waste tax money trying to “rehabilitate” then? What good does it do? It doesn’t stop them. Maybe the threat of being caught and murdered would keep them from acting on their sick desires. Their victims are forever destroyed, so no I don’t feel any sympathy for them. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>After reading a lot of the replies to this post, I am scared for what the future holds. Many of you claim or atleast allude that pedophilia is a normal sexual desire! What the fuck?</p>

<p>I know there are mental deficiencies. I understand that a person could even have a sexual desire for animals or even inanimate objects, and no its not a more power to you situation. This should not be normalized, it should be called exactly what it is &quot;wrong&quot; and no I am not trying to be the &quot;mind police&quot;.  Think what you want, but understand that sexual desires are one of human beings strongest driving forces, and there is absolutely nothing legally or morally right about wanting to have sex with a child!!!!!!!!!!!!! </p>

<p>So if your fucked in the head and you want to have sex with a child, you will try to find a way to do so. Even if you masturbate to child porn you are in effect promoting a monstrous evil industry. </p>

<p>Our children are our biggest investment in every way! Any sane person would lose all sense of control if they found out that a pedophile was trying to have &quot;sex&quot; with their child. </p>

<p>So answer me this? As a parent your mental wiring is a product of millions of years of evolution: Protect Protect Protect!!!!! Are you going to say it is wrong when a parent completely and utterly murders a pedophile who is only trying to feed his &quot;normal&quot; sexual desire? Or are you going to protect the parent who is wired to protect their children at all costs? </p>

<p>Can&#39;t believe I felt the need to write all this shit. I find anyone who can possibly defend this disgusting! </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Did you watch the video? There&#39;s a difference between pedophiles and sex offenders. A pedophile who understands that they have a problem and willingly looks for help with their problem rather than holds it in and ends up raping children is someone who should be applauded and respected. They&#39;re someone who was dealt a bad hand and yet did the right thing. </p>

<p>Child abusers deserve no mercy, but we definitely SHOULD encourage non-offending pedophiles to come forward and seek help, and support them when they do, because that&#39;s the kind of attitude that will save children.</p>

<p>Your instincts are correct. Scary that so many people are so easily coerced to disregard theirs. But these are predators, and they are generally predators who groom their victims. They are good at what they do. Children have no chance. But adults should know better.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The title on this post is very sensational, the Ted Talk makes a very good argument:</p>

<p><strong>&quot;How can we treat pedophilia or those with these preferences to seek help with so much stigma social ostracization?&quot;</strong></p>

<p>We must treat pedophilia the same way we treat other mental issues and help rehabilitate these people. We can avoid dangerous situations to help people refrain from acting on their sexual urges by seeking to understand and treat them. </p>

<p>Pretty intelligent Ted-Talk imo</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Dead wrong. Any convicted pedo must be executed. We will not normalize pedophila and put it on same level with depression, as you suggest. </p>

<p>No amount of pedos or pedo sympathizers will change our minds. We will not allow it and will continuously advocate for public executions of the convicted. We do not care about pedos feelings and we WANT them to know we are disgusted by them and find them absolutely repugnant. Pedos should be shamed and hate themselves. They are not normal and must be purged to prevent the spread of this wicked evil. I will die on this hill and never retreat. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You should watch the Ted talk, it discusses why this exact behavior toward pedophilia doesn&#39;t cause it to simply &quot;stop&quot;. Rather it continues underground and progresses to the point of action and victimization.</p>

<p>No one ever said anything about &quot;normalizing&quot; pedophilia. Its a problem that we have to deal with - we don&#39;t win by going to &quot;war&quot; like we do here in the states with the &quot;War on Drugs&quot;. </p>

<p>We all know how unsuccessful that has been.</p>

<p>Rather it must be treated like a disease, it must be understood to be properly diagnosed and &quot;cured&quot;. By allowing those who experience urges of pedophilia to come forward, we grant them the opportunity to understand their own urges and most importantly - <em>change.</em></p>

<p>We have a different moral compass I guess. I don&#39;t look at pedos as someone who is &quot;sick&quot;. I look at them like an evil that must be eradicated. There is no coming back from pedophila and there is no &quot;treatment&quot; that doesn&#39;t involve a bullet. </p>

I sympathize for the victims.
I sympathize for the victimizers. 
I have sympathy for all of humanity. </p>

<p>The easiest thing in the world to judge others, it requires no perspective, no empathy and no development of character.</p>

<p>While we both agree that the eradication of pedophilia is necessary, the nature of <strong>how</strong> that&#39;s to be done is where we disagree. </p>

<p>Simply placing a &quot;bullet&quot; in each person that experiences urges of pedophilia may &quot;end&quot; the person - but it fails to resolve the root issue which created the urges in the first place.</p>

<p>The more we can take the time to understand those who experience life differently than ourselves, the greater we grow in ability to resolve greater issues past our limited perspective. </p>

<p>There are three options among humans: female, male, or both. </p>

<p>Whether some sicko likes children in <em>combination</em> with any of those options is just them being a sick predator on top of that.</p>

<p>Indeed studies on pedophiles show clear orientations. The majority target female children specifically. So they are heterosexual child predators. Others are homosexual, or bisexual child rapists. </p>

<p>As for all this &quot;poor pedophile&quot; bs, I might start taking it seriously when they start lining up for voluntary castration. These guys are full of shit and this is just a grooming of the population as an extension of the grooming they apply to their victims. </p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>Pushing it to the underground means they will only find solace with other pedophiles, thus creating networks of abusers.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Doesn&#39;t this viewpoint presume that pedophiles are abusers? </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Pedophiles are less likely to seek council and advice from people who will actually give them good advice, for fear of backlash.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If only there were some decentralized information search tool that would allow people to find information anonymously.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>They are less likely to care about what society thinks of them when they are preemptively ostracized. Less to lose so more likely to commit abuse.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So pedophiles need society&#39;s approval in order to not commit abuse? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t believe any of this bullshit, sorry. Ostracizing pedophiles is not what causes children to get abused. It&#39;s not normal people&#39;s fault that pedophiles abuse children. Not in one single case is this true. If anyone&#39;s interest in sexualizing children is high enough that they&#39;d mention it to anyone, i WANT them on a registry. I WANT to be able to find that out. If they can keep a lid on it their whole life, fine, that&#39;s <em>good practice</em> for not acting on something. Encouraging any sort of self expression on the topic is not. </p>

This is of course pre-committing a crime. after that full blow castration and possible life imprisonment or enforced death. after all they have completely destroyed multiple ppl&#39;s lives. sounds harsh but i don&#39;t think  99.9% have the ability to change their ways even  wanted too.
