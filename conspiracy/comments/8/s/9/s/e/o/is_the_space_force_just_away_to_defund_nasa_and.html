    <div class="md"><p>For several reasons Florida is geographically one of the best places in the states to launch into orbit.  Since the days of LBJ politicians have been making promises to increase NASA spending not just for science but in order to gain political capital in Senate races and the electoral college.</p>

<p>Look at how Trump&#39;s pro coal policy helps him in coal countries.  By promising to protect jobs and invest in the industry the voting populous is much more likely to support you.</p>

<p>Ric Scott&#39;s term limits have kicked in so he cannot run for governor again.  He has been tapped by Trump to run against your democratic senator Bill Nelson. Scott now as an advantage over Nelson by campaigning on a pro Trump policy that will further strengthen Florida&#39;s economy.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Gravitomagnetics is a while different animal which nobody has been <em>officially</em> researching since the 1960s. The standard conspiracy theory is that big breakthroughs were moved into black budget programs and developed through the 1970s, resulting in exotic craft such as the TR-3B.  </p>

<p>The proposed mechanism involves spinning rings of highly charged superconducting fluids, producing an interaction between electromagnetism and gravity which is not discussed openly in academic circles. Supposedly, there is some experimental evidence for this gravitoelectromagnetic force. It is typically so small that we would not measure it, but it has since been identified due to superconductor research. Black budget military programs have supposedly kept a near-perfect monopoly on academic research into the subject.  </p>

<p>This would be an extraordinary step, because chemical propulsion is messy, expensive, and very heavy. This technology would be able to convert electrical energy directly into a total or partial cancellation of gravitational force and perhaps even more exotic effects.  </p>

<p>Interesting to say the least.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t think it&#39;s to defund NASA, necessarily.  Perhaps NASA will be better off in the long run?  If NASA is assigned to or absorbed by the Space Force, they might have access to more funds.  This will definitely increase our military budget.  And will cement Trump in history as the president who founded the Space Force.  </p>

<p>In 2525, it&#39;s possible the starship Enterprise will encounter the starship Trump.  God help us.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have to agree, I don’t think this is a bad thing for NASA. If anything it’s distributing funds from our massive military budget to projects that NASA is going to be interested in anyways, but without “detracting from national security” or whatever. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I wanna see some weed grown in space that’s all I care about, let’s get some fuckin anti gravity strains poppin ayy lmaooo</p>

<p>In all seriousness though this is actually quite a good thing and will give us a lot more of a science based budget under the guise of “military”, although it will definitely be used to militarize space which is a con, but on the whole will encourage more corporate and national interest in space which is a way bigger pro and was probably the smartest way to get some more money shifted towards the space agenda without raising too many of TPTB’s eyebrows. Good on trump tbh </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I actually did read many replies. A new branch of military is supposed to emerge from a flag hugging president. Caution is advised when you decide to militarize outer space. </p>

<p>Says one &quot;I need another 5000 dollar hammer. The truth is this is actually the truth. &quot;build me a space station one that spins in the sky like James Bond had&quot;. Dementia, what is this. I can not have my children going to university, because of the taxes I need to pay. Then how will your child ever join the Space Force. The university grad who is slow will not even be allowed to clean the floors. The elite of the elite. A new reality comes true. </p>

<p>Congress has avoided the topic and wishful thinking does not allow some leader to grasp deeply into the national treasury again. The charity the POTUS created with 150 plus millions began to find errors all of the time and perhaps someone with red hair (okay colored hair) has children with good ability to get their greedy fingers on that charities money. </p>

<p>Hug my flag. Hug my flag. Space the final frontier. Dementia. The trillions of dollars lost already just in maintaining the war machine is demented. Decade after decade. The last war to end all wars World War Two, was 70 years ago. Time to get off the high horse and come back to reality. </p>

<p>NASA is the official Space Agency. Defunding that puppy will collapse all chances to a prosperous future. The delusion has come forward and some do seem to agree with the concept. I think age is noticed, of hunger to go into deep space. &quot;get me the hell out of here&quot;. Okay so some of us Elders do relish the idea of leaving all of this behind. </p>

<p>Notice also the alienation the USA is now experiencing with the entire world;  as tariffs and bluster and even activating the seventh fleet to show PURE POWER. The entire world is laughing at us. </p>

<p>Enjoy your life and your debt and your ignorance to others. </p>
