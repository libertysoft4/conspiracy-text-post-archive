    <div class="md"><p>Trump had a deal that if a movie was going to film on his property it was free as long as he was in it.  That&#39;s how he ended up in Home Alone 2.  He is also the owner of his own Fame.  Fame is usually something someone gives you.  Your a star in Hollywood because someone makes you a star.  You have Fame in music because record producers choose you.  If the MSM decides they don&#39;t like you they will tear you image to shreds, Trump has been able to avoid that mostly due to his money </p>

<p>The way Fame was handed out in the past is vastly different today.  YouTube and SoundCloud are revolutions in how fame can be created.  When you have a computer in your pocket and can shoot videos and edit music where ever you on your own anyone is empowered to create your own Fame.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Instagram models, pew Dee pie Brandon swab every music genre on sound cloud.  Laura Loomer Alex Jones.  Ice poiseden xxxtraction Jeremy Johns Brandon scaub Adam corralla.    Just look at anyone who has 50000 followers and can monetize it they have more fame and consider how hard it would be for someone just 15 years ago having the ability to build anything like that without some sort of help from someone with more power then themselves.</p>

<p>I wonder if you think fame requires you to be known and loved by millions around the world.  People where famous before television and radio there is no reason to hold the concept of fame to those standards.  Consider this, if you where the most well known person in your town would you be famous?  In a world where social media allows you to have social contacts that are not bound by geography as they were in the past is it really impossible to be famous.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not saying you can download an app and be famous, it takes hard work and utizilled your strengths.  Some people are more better looking or charismatic the others and they have an advantage.  But if you go look at the top bands and musical acts before MTV they were some ugly ass people that where famous. </p>
