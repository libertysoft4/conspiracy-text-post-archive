    <div class="md"><p>you guys are correct. there is a conspiracy going on here. youre wrong about its being played out though. slick willy and the dems may have crafted the current immigration laws but trump is the one attempting to undo anything any dem has ever done while lying, cheating, and blaming the dems for everything. to me, that sounds very &quot;deep state&quot;esque. trump is the puppet of the deep state who are trying to destroy the country and you all are falling for it, even helping them along.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>well, trump did just rescind his zero tolerance policy that was separating families at the border. that was my initial post on this topic, that trump has the power to stop it since he is the one who started it. you are the fools who were towing his line of BS claiming it started decades ago and its all obamas fault, &quot;BUT HILLARY!&quot;, and shit. i corrected your errors and you ahd to wait for trump to actually act before you could finally see your errors. you were too busy trying to be edgy, or anarchist, to see the real picture. stop tripping over your own feet and maybe you could walk a little better.</p>

<p>The vast majority of these kids are brought into this country by traffickers/smugglers. They use these kids for protection. If the law is repealed without another plan in place, the trafficking of children is going to skyrocket.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Even given the increased number of alleged smugglers this fiscal year and the decreased number of family units, those smugglers, those traffickers, those MS-13 members, make up only 0.61 percent of the total number of family units apprehended at the border. In other words, for every 1,000 families that approached the border in the first five months of this fiscal year, only six allegedly involved individuals pretending to be a child’s parents. The percentage of alleged smugglers in fiscal 2017 was smaller, at 0.1 percent.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Trump is responsible, because he moved to a zero tolerance policy, which means even the ones attempting to enter legally under asylum are being detained(previous administrations did not detain those seeking asylum)</p>

<p>This change to zero tolerance has caused a dramatic spike in the families being detained(2000 kids detained in the past 6 weeks)</p>

<p>There are also pictures going around that show kids detained during the Obama administration, but they are unrelated, as there was a spike of unaccompanied children entering during 2014 due to a spike in violence in South America. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ok, it&#39;s obvious what side you are on.  Can you at least admit this is  a political game?  There are ways to do immigration that does not, or at the very least minimizes the need to separate parents from their children.  One side has decided to use this a political tactic to cause immigration reform.  The other side is trying to exploit that tactic for the opposite gain.</p>

<p>Both sides are using people, flesh and blood, as ammunition to get their way.</p>

<p>I didn&#39;t name parties on purpose, because you and pick and choose which is which depending on your own personal experiences and preferences.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I am with you on that. This is a giant political game. Using children as tools to advance an agenda is never ok. Where was the media when this was happening under Obama? So, his policy was to separate children from parents on their second attempt, not first. So that makes it ok? The whole reason for this - The Democrats who wrote the bill intended for it to save children from abuse and trafficking. You think it’s ok to put kids together with a bunch of adults? These people arrive with no documentation, nothing to prove they’re actually related. Traffickers use children as shields against getting caught. The world is not that nice and rosey. People look to take advantage of children who have no say. What is the alternative? Just release thousands and thousands of undocumented, unaccountable, illegal people into our cities and tell them Good Luck??</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Wrong.  Trump only implemented a zero tolerance policy to the laws that have been carried out by Clinton, Bush and Obama.  Zero tolerance against people breaking laws is a good thing.</p>

<p>You do realize that this is also a crackdown on child trafficking right?  You do realize that the &quot;parents&quot; of these kids can provide no evidence to that.  You do realize how easy it is for someone who wants to enter the US to kidnap a child to use?  Lax immigration policies of &quot;if you have a child you may enter&quot; encourages this.</p>

Why the outrage over holding people accountable to the laws of this country vs outrage that people are KNOWINGLY attempting to cross a border ILLEGALLY, therefore breaking the law.

If the precedent is set that those with children will be gleefully accepted with no consequences, what it will turn into is more child trafficking to cross the border and then dump the kids wherever.  </p>

US Veterans who are homeless and starving
US Citizens who are killed and/or injured by illegal immigrants</p>

<p>Do you really think <em>every single child</em> has come in with &quot;parents&quot;, even the ones who want to stay with their families and cry for their mother and father? Because Trump is separating <em>all children</em> from their parents, whether they broke the law or not.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The intricities are that first timevillegal border crossing is a misdemeanor. Hence why Obama&#39;s policy just returned the family back to thier resident country without seperation. Trump policy is to seperate families always, under Obama policy this happened upon the second crossing attempt.</p>

<p>The Obama administration struggled with finding a solution and it is documented they decided not to use seperation of families as a deterrent.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>They did mention it, however as part of the larger picture. Just like US families get seperated when a single parent goes to jail, the seperation was resulting from the felony. The difference is mainly those seperations were identical to seperations of US citizens under the same circumstances. These seperations without being a felony are done only to illrgal immigrants.</p>

<p>And sorry if it seemed like I was spreading misinformation. From what I&#39;ve read the Trump administration has been keeping parents in detention until their federal court date and by extension keeping their children separate. If you got any more info I&#39;d appreciate it cause I wouldn&#39;t mind learning more. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>What are we supposed to do with all these people illegally flooding into our country? Do we just give them a wad of cash at the border and send them on their merry way? Do Dems really want open flows of migrants with no oversight into our country? What’s the point of having a border? What’s the point of having legal immigration, when you can just hop the border and have everything handed to you??? </p>

<p>I have a small child, and I would fight to the death of someone tried to take him from me. But, I am also not putting him in an extremely dangerous situation and breaking the law while he’s in my care. It’s illegal to enter our country without permission. If you do something illegal you get arrested. If you have kids with you while you get arrested, and have no other family to take care of them, what is to be done with the children??? People act like these kids are being held forever. They are processed and released. It’s an awful situation, with no good outcome. What’s even more awful is using children to further your political goals. The ABC world news played about 10 seconds of children crying. No way to prove it’s actually the migrant children, just kids crying for their parents. This is used to tug at our most basic human emotions, and it works like a charm. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>America used to have one spot called Ellis island on the east coast of the US.  It served as a Federal Inspection Station for most immigrants on the east coast.  It was closed in 1954 when Air travel became the most dominant form to  immigrate in the US.  I bring this up only because America is known to have points of access. Ellis island is how my family came over to America.  I know i may be asking this in the wrong spot, but why cant we have a Federal Inspection on the southern border? </p>

<p>Like it or not we are getting flooded with a mass of people in a short amount of time.I myself dont like the fact of separation.  It is obvious that we dont have the facilities to handle the mass of people coming though that border.  </p>
