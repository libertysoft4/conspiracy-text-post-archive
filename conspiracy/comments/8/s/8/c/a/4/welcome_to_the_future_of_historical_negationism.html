        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>This is currently the new policy over at r/history.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Historical negationism or denialism is an illegitimate distortion of the historical record.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Illegitimate as decided by who?</p>

<p>Define &quot;distortion&quot; while you&#39;re at it.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>TLDR: Historical negationism is more than not history, it is an attempt to negate history. Additionally, &quot;Just asking questions&quot; is one of the oldest tricks in the book, and we aren&#39;t going to fall for it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yeah, this is so awesome. /s</p>

<p>Asking questions keeps a subject alive and constitutes the only proof that someone is still capable of thinking about something. Telling someone they aren&#39;t even allowed to ask a question is the same as telling them they aren&#39;t allowed to think for themselves.</p>

<p>Not allowing any questions is itself, one of the oldest tricks in the book. It&#39;s a religious concept and in the world of faith, it&#39;s known as orthodoxy. </p>

<ul>
<li><p>Orthodoxy is adherence to correct or accepted creeds, especially in religion. </p></li>
<li><p>Authorized or generally accepted theory, doctrine, or practice.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>So we&#39;ve got this concept that someone out there has an absolute monopoly on the truth (in this case the historical truth) and that they (not you!) get to decide what can and can&#39;t be said... and now they decide which questions are allowed.</p>

<p>Imo, this represents a couple of things.</p>

<p>One, it&#39;s them sticking their fingers in their ears going &quot;nyah nyah nyah, we can&#39;t hear you.&quot;</p>

<p>Two, it&#39;s outright censorship being used to categorically shut down anyone who might ask one of those inconvenient questions that makes it too hard to defend whatever &quot;facts&quot; they hold dear.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Is that the right call in the big scheme of things? Who knows. But we do firmly believe that given the limited resources available to us, and our stated mission of keeping <a href="/r/history">/r/history</a> a place for real historical discussion, there is no reasonable alternative to deal with it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Sure there&#39;s a reasonable alternative. It&#39;s called &quot;Leaving things the way they are.&quot; Saying there&#39;s  no reasonable alternative is a scam to make people think they&#39;re making an effort at maintaining balance. In actual fact, this is the most unbalanced possible choice.</p>

<p>As if you needed any more proof that the mods over there know how well this will go down, the comments section was locked as soon as the announcement was posted.</p>

<p>Is the title ironic? Decide for yourself.</p>

<p><strong>An Update to Rule 3 from your Jackbooted Censoring Overlords: Historical negationism and You!</strong></p>

<p>tldr; r/history has gone over to the dark side.</p>

<p>This has been happening for 60 years. For example, the US Holocaust Memorial Museum <a href="https://www.ushmm.org/wlc/en/article.php?ModuleId=10005214">now says</a>: &quot;There is no credible evidence that the gas chamber in Barrack X was used to murder human beings.&quot;</p>

<p>I wonder what to think about the hundreds of &quot;eye witnesses&quot; that have been saying otherwise? Did they <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j30sWIOMIak">confuse their imagination with reality</a>?</p>

<p>You cross a very real line once you start demanding mental conformity and are willing to use censorship and user bans to back it up.</p>

<p>The first step to an authoritarian (or totalitarian) state is when you start punishing people for thinking the wrong thoughts. That&#39;s what they just did over at r/history.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Good OP OB1, thanks.</p>

<p>Another way to put it is ... what kind of researcher is the historian, if his conclusions are pre-determined by criminal law?</p>

<p>Indeed, isn&#39;t scientific inquiry revisionism <em>by definition</em>? Didn&#39;t Galileo negate Copernicus? Didn&#39;t Einstein negate Ǹewton?</p>

<p>Also note, it is not revisionism or even negationism that is forbidden, agnosticism is too; you cannot &quot;not know&quot;, or &quot;reserve your judgement&quot;. </p>

<p>Heck, even <strong>thought that is mainstream for historians cannot be uttered by non-historians</strong>: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functionalism_versus_intentionalism">I present you one among many examples.</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks for the compliment. The thing that I&#39;m seeing here isn&#39;t about drama, it&#39;s about a pattern. </p>

<p>The pattern is when someone is tempted to exercise a little bit of power just because they can. In this case, it&#39;s the power to control what other people can say (whether it&#39;s a statement or even a question) and the power to decide what&#39;s OK or not OK.</p>

<p>The problem with this power is that, for all those poor little subscribers and the mods to be free from inconvenient questions (or Graham Hancock supporters) everyone else loses to freedom to express their own ideas or ask their own questions.</p>

<p>That&#39;s not a good trade-off when much is lost for the smallest of gains.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This update on the History subreddit seems to be a reaction to a post on the Graham Hancock subreddit. A redditor asked a question about Graham Hancock during an AMA on the History subreddit and was promptly splatted with the ban-hammer. </p>

<p>Equating Hancock and fringe archaeology with Holocaust denial by giving them the same label of &#39;Historical Negationism&#39; and refusing to even allow an AMA guest to explain why fringe archaeology is fringe instead of being mainstream is ridiculous. It results in historical or archaeological research being dominated by authorities pronouncing some unquestionable truth instead of proper debate.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Everybody has their when they woke up story (if they ever did).</p>

<p>I started waking up in the 90s when I realized Napoleon was the opposite of how I was brainwashed to view him. I was brainwashed to view him as a short fat **shole who wanted to take over the world “just like Hitler”.</p>

<p>Why would the powers that be want to malign a powerful ingenious white guy with the courage to take on all those lying creeps on at once? </p>

<p>If I ever do anything right it’s because I’m trying to honor the memory of someone who I view as not perfect but Heroic. </p>

<p>If you really get into researching Napoleon, he was not a warmonger. The opposition is and has always been itching for war. It took a military general to put fairer laws in place for most of Europe (for a time).</p>

<p>He lost in the end. Now this is our world but at least he fought this infernal feudalism with everything he had!</p>

<p>I noticed that people from the US and Canada are a lot more neutral to Boney than Brits are.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>He got in a lot of battles and had a pretty good winning streak. Then in the last part of his career he was a lot more political and introduced reforms and legislation that was pretty progressive by the standards of the day.</p>

<p>I think a lot of French people still look back on him with pride or even fondness?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ob1_kenobi, I cant see your question anymore. People rarely indulge my wish to discuss Napoleon. I’m American. I studied Napoleon in Paris and I was surprised that people were actually hostile about him there. The brainwashing about Napoleon is a huge motivator in what I do. We’ve been indoctrinated to loathe a dominant brilliant white man who had the courage to push the oligarchs BACK. Of course they want to prop up their garbage fake mind controlled “celebrities” and they indoctrinate that strength and heroism is bad and wrong and evil. It’s all backwards.</p>
