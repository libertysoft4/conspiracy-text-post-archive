<p>This sub is supposed to be about finding the truth, not be told religious lies.   The “Church” is the oldest and largest TPTB that have ever existed, controlling what people say and think.</p>

<p>Rev 21:8  But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone: which is the second death. </p>

<p>Repent and believe this to be saved:</p>

<p>1Co 15:1  Moreover, brethren, I declare unto you the gospel which I preached unto you, which also ye have received, and wherein ye stand; 
1Co 15:2  By which also ye are saved, if ye keep in memory what I preached unto you, unless ye have believed in vain. 
1Co 15:3  For I delivered unto you first of all that which I also received, how that Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures; 
1Co 15:4  And that he was buried, and that he rose again the third day according to the scriptures:</p>

<p>God gave you this life freely to choose.  Whether you repent in this life or are thrown into the lake of fire for eternity as God mocks you, either way, God will get the glory.</p>

<p>Pro 1:22  How long, ye simple ones, will ye love simplicity? and the scorners delight in their scorning, and fools hate knowledge? 
Pro 1:23  Turn you at my reproof: behold, I will pour out my spirit unto you, I will make known my words unto you. 
Pro 1:24  Because I have called, and ye refused; I have stretched out my hand, and no man regarded; 
Pro 1:25  But ye have set at nought all my counsel, and would none of my reproof: 
Pro 1:26  I also will laugh at your calamity; I will mock when your fear cometh; 
Pro 1:27  When your fear cometh as desolation, and your destruction cometh as a whirlwind; when distress and anguish cometh upon you. 
Pro 1:28  Then shall they call upon me, but I will not answer; they shall seek me early, but they shall not find me: 
Pro 1:29  For that they hated knowledge, and did not choose the fear of the LORD: 
Pro 1:30  They would none of my counsel: they despised all my reproof. 
Pro 1:31  Therefore shall they eat of the fruit of their own way, and be filled with their own devices. 
Pro 1:32  For the turning away of the simple shall slay them, and the prosperity of fools shall destroy them. 
Pro 1:33  But whoso hearkeneth unto me shall dwell safely, and shall be quiet from fear of evil. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s funny, when your brain shuts down, you just start vomiting up verses like they mean something.  Well, here are the ones relevant to this...  discussion...</p>

<p>Revelation 22:16
I, Jesus, have sent my angel to give you this testimony for the churches. I am the Root and the Offspring of David, the Lucifer.</p>

<p>Isaiah 14:3-12
3 On the day the Lord gives you relief from your suffering and turmoil and from the harsh labor forced on you, 4 you will take up this taunt against the king of Babylon:</p>

<p>How the oppressor has come to an end!
    How his fury[a] has ended!
5 The Lord has broken the rod of the wicked,
    the scepter of the rulers,
6 which in anger struck down peoples
    with unceasing blows,
and in fury subdued nations
    with relentless aggression.
7 All the lands are at rest and at peace;
    they break into singing.
8 Even the junipers and the cedars of Lebanon
    gloat over you and say,
“Now that you have been laid low,
    no one comes to cut us down.”</p>

<p>9 The realm of the dead below is all astir
    to meet you at your coming;
it rouses the spirits of the departed to greet you—
    all those who were leaders in the world;
it makes them rise from their thrones—
    all those who were kings over the nations.
10 They will all respond,
    they will say to you,
“You also have become weak, as we are;
    you have become like us.”
11 All your pomp has been brought down to the grave,
    along with the noise of your harps;
maggots are spread out beneath you
    and worms cover you.</p>

<p>12 How you have fallen from heaven,
    morning star, son of the dawn!

    <div class="md"><p>It started when the Trump supporters threw in their lot with the religious right and the racists (lots of overlap).  In internet terms, that means non racist, non religious folks had to put up with that stuff to keep the coalition together.  I even found some of my alt-right friends even started finding religion.  So when the coalition gets cozy and the sides help each other out, you get the religious folks posting their cringey stuff right and left.</p>

<p>But as the coalition falls apart (as it will in coming months), the regular conspiracy minded, atheist believing folks will finally turn on the religious and the racist folks and shit will get ugly right quick.</p>

<p>The anti-Trump crew aren&#39;t here for any conspiracies. They are here to destroy President Trump and use this forum to piggyback those goals just as they do r/television, r/nba anytime someone says something about President Trump, r/sports during the anthem stuff, r/todayIlearned with it&#39;s front page nazi post of the day and so forth. And it&#39;s fairly easy to tell when people get mass downvoted, harassed, when TMOR has to be banned from here because of brigading and when any time some incident with President Trump comes up, it&#39;s a first post gilded comment.</p>

<p>Naw, you just haven’t examined the Bible critically.  To quote Clarence Larkin:</p>

<p><em>This brings us to the great question - that is, did God write it, or is it simply a collection of the writings of men? if it is simply a collection of the writings of men, without any divine guidance, then it is no more reliable than are the writings of men; but if God wrote it, then it must be true, and we can depend upon its statements. It is clear from the character of the Bible that it is not the work of man, for man could not have written it if he would. and would not have written it if he could.</em></p>

<p><em>It details with scathing and unsparing severity the sins of its greatest men, as Abraham, Jacob, Moses, David and Solomon, charging them with falsehood, treachery, pride, adultery, cowardice, murder and gross licentiousness, and presents the history of the Children of Israel as a humiliating record of ingratitude, idolatry, unbelief and rebellion, and it is safe to say, that the Jews, unguided and undirected by the Holy Spirit, would never have chronicled the sinful history of their nation.</em></p>

<p>You also have to reject all prophecy <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Isaiah+53&amp;amp;version=KJV">regarding Christ</a> as coincidence/conspiracy, while also ignoring the uniqueness of Israel as the <em>only</em> culture of antiquity that banned any image of their deity.  Without God, evil doesn’t exist.  I’ve seen enough to know that true evil does exist.  This world is dark.  And there’s only one light.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There are a lot of religions which are all about critical thinking. Gnosticism, the pythagoreans, Hindu, Buddhism, Taoism. </p>

<p>Also, a lot of these religions believe that physical existence is a conspiracy to place more importance on the body than the soul. </p>

<p>This ties into modern societies obsession with individualism and materialism. </p>

<p>Just because you think religion is mind control, doesn&#39;t make it so. Your opinion is valid, but it is still an opinion. </p>

<p>It should be noted that all conspiracies exist for the sake of gaining power and control and wealth. This has heavy spiritual implications for those who believe. </p>

<p>Throughout history, there has been a pattern of killing people for the proclamation that god exists as the infinite source from which all springs forth. </p>

<p>Conspiracy theorists seek knowledge, and ultimately, truth and knowledge are linked to the divine. </p>

<p>As far as the meaning of what you&#39;re saying, it&#39;s great stuff! I find it very interesting that all symbology predating geometry illustrates this concept. However, as I&#39;ve understood it, the zero is more of a superposition of everything and nothing existing as one. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s great feedback. I can most recently quote &quot;The Invention of Science&quot;, by David Wooton (2015), p176-177, for a clue:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Perspective painting generally involves a peculiar form of abstraction: the construction of a <strong>vanishing point</strong>. It is worth noting that the term itself is relatively modern: in English it dates to 1715. [Leon Battista] Alberti [1404-1472] called it the centric point <em>(il punto del centro)</em>, and in many early texts it is simply referred to as &#39;the horizon&#39;. But Alberti is perfectly clear that the image in a one-point-perspective painting extends &quot;to an almost infinate distance&quot;. This, to a Renaissance intellectual, is a deeply puzzling concept. Aristotle&#39;s universe is finite and spherical; moreover, it is not surrounded by infinite space and there is no such thing as empty space. Indeed, Aristotle [384–322 BC] does not really have a concept of space as distinct from the objects which fill it. So, for Aristotle, all space is finite, all space is place, and the idea of an infinite extension is conceptually contradictory, just like the idea of a vacuum.</p>

<p>This is not true, of course, in Euclidean geometry, where parallel lines can be extended indefinitely without meeting (nor, it may be added, in the optics of [Hasan Ibn al-Haytham] Alhazen [c. 965 – c. 1040]). But what you can see when you look across an infinite distance is precisely nothing. It helps, then, if you want to work with a vanishing point, to have <strong>a concept of nothing</strong>. Euclid [who was born around the time Aristotle died] lacked the number zero, which was introduced into Western Europe in the early thirteenth century with what we call the Arabic numerals (actually, it is the only one of the ten numerals that is Arabic; the others are Indian). Arabic numerals made possible the paper-based accounting of double-entry bookkeeping. Zeros are wonderfully useful, even if deeply mysterious; perhaps only a culture which had the number zero could have made sense of the idea that a vanishing point could be both a point of non-seeing and the key to the interpretation of painting.  </p>

<p>There&#39;s also the branch dravidians, plus 100s of weird splinter Christian denominations with all kinds of govt conspiracy weirdness as a part of their narratives. Then you got all your new Agers and various misinterpreting eastern mysticism cults...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve noticed religious people tend to believe crazier theories like Flat Earth and Reptoids but I guess that&#39;s kind of expected.</p>

<p>At the risk of sounding like I&#39;m disparaging the religious, if they&#39;ve already accepted the existence of God without evidence then there&#39;s really nothing so crazy that they couldn&#39;t accept it on faith alone.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>But the global elites that have controlled power for centuries have all belonged to mainstream religions (various sects of Christianity for the most part).   The only President of the United States that wasn’t a mainstream church-goer is Trump, who has no record of religiousness until he switched parties in his 70’s and started his campaign to court the religious right vote (hence continuing the tradition of Christian ruling elite).</p>

<p>The only religions that generally have been shat on and can’t be expressed in public and will ruin your career would be perhaps Wicca/Pagan, Zoroastrianism,  and Satanism.   Oh and Scientology (unless you are an actor, then it might advance your career).</p>
