    <div class="md"><p>Maybe, but I think it&#39;s just straight up political propaganda.  It is an election year, after all.  I would guess that the democrats did a lot of focus group testing and found that this was something that resonated with potential democrat supporters, and now they are trying to gin up some good old fashioned outrage, which democrat voters love more than almost anything else in this world.  That would explain why it&#39;s suddenly a major issue now, but no one gave a fuck about it when it was happening under the Obama administration.</p>

<p>The Uniparty definitely exists, that is to say, a lot of the high level career Congressmen are all working together for the moneyed interests that fund them, as opposed to representing their constituents.  However, they are not all powerful and have opposition from within their own parties.  I don&#39;t think Trump was planned.  Based on the reaction from Uniparty politicians and the talking heads in the media.  I do think that the Russian narrative was planned, but it was intended to give Hillary justification for aggression against Russia and Russian interests after she won.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Divide and conquer is real, but humans have all ways divided themselves along those lines.  The powers that be wan&#39;t you to believe we are living in the most divided time period ever, but looking at history, that&#39;s not the truth.  It&#39;s worse than it was in the 80&#39;s and 90&#39;s, but still much better than in the past, and the farther back you go, the worse it gets.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I think they are preparing for another world war. (A reset button) to give the human race a few more centuries.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I agree with you here.  But I think they want a repeat of the late 60&#39;s and early 70&#39;s political violence, not full on civil war.  But I guess if shit goes awry, all bets are off.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is what is ironic about your mentality. It is more self-assuring to think one person or group does have control over reality, even if they are the evilest person or group imaginable than to consider the prospect that no one person or group has that much control. The chaos is far more frightening than evil. </p>

<p>This is the basis for the entire conspiracy mindset. Unfortunately, it leaves you blind to the many people and groups that have control over smaller realities. The cult leader, the corrupt mayor, dirty cop, the cartel leader. They don&#39;t work together for some grand plan, but while you are investigating NASA on the moon they are down the street picking pockets. </p>

Then, whatever happens, happens together.  Either they are deported, together, or they are granted asylum and stay in the US, together.</p>

Pizza gate is a joke now, even though there is clear evidence our leaders are taking part in child trafficking. It’s not about republicans vs Democrats. It about the people vs fucking monsters.

<p>Between October 1, 2017 and May 31, 2018, at least 2,700 children have been split from their parents. 1,995 of them were separated over the last six weeks of that window — April 18 to May 31 — indicating that at present, an average of 45 children are being taken from their parents each day.</p>

<p>These people are not criminals</p>

<p>No matter how you try to justify it, if they crossed the border <em>illegally</em>, they are in fact criminals. Try crossing over into any other country in the world saying that you&#39;re seeking asylum, and if you didn&#39;t go through the proper channels, there will be consequences. If the parents really gave a damn about being separated from the kids, they wouldn&#39;t take the risk of putting their children in that situation. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>A speeding ticket is a civil infraction, which means neither misdemeanor nor felony. But nice try with the false equivalence. Take your kids and go shoplifting. When you get caught and arrested, are they going to jail with you? If there is another guardian available to take them, they will go that route, but in the case of illegal immigrants, we can&#39;t verify relationship if we can&#39;t even verify who it is that just got put into custody. </p>

<p>To make matters worse, they are endangering the children just bringing them over the way they do in most cases. Here in AZ, temperatures can get up to 120 during the summer, and still be in the triple digits well after midnight, when a lot of these people are traveling. Dehydration can and will kill someone very quickly in the conditions we see here, especially when there is a lot of physical activity involved. There&#39;s also the risk of rape or murder by the coyotes that may be bringing them over. Add in the face that there are also predators and venomous snakes in the desert, and you&#39;re looking at another potential for death. These people are risking their families lives. The part that pisses me off the most is the fact that they are endangering the lives of their children, when they could go to a port of entry  and apply for asylum. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not OP that you were replying to but I tried to be a foster parent with my wife and the process is so unbelievably fucked up and impossibly hard that it’s not worth it. It’s easy to look at one half of the picture and not consider the other but OP does have a point about the kids being put into foster care. If there’s not enough foster families for the kids to go then they have to go somewhere, which is a whole other argument that I don’t feel like discussing. And not to mention that you can only apply for foster parenting in the state that you live in unless your state has partnered with another state. For example: if you live in Texas you can only foster Texas resident children. If you live in North Dakota however, you can foster South Dakota, Minnesota, and Montana resident children, but not Native American children. Not trying to argue, just tryin to bring some perspective to the conversation. </p>

<p>You&#39;ve been asked what your solution would be twice now and haven&#39;t answered.</p>

<p>It&#39;s one thing to just complain, but the problem is real. So what is your solution? If you are going to scream and be outraged at what someone is doing, then suggest a solution.</p>

<p>But you see, that&#39;s the problem: No matter what solution Trump does, the left are going to be outraged. It&#39;s what they do. There is a fricking election coming up. Have you heard ANY of these people screaming about this (despite ignoring when Obama was doing it) offer any actual solution?</p>

<p>People get all worked up, like always, and then when the election is over, they are on to something else. Hell, next week it will be something else. Last week, it was Trump meeting a dictator.</p>

<p>Maybe, just maybe, it&#39;s all about the elections and not really all that sincere. Maybe you are just being riled up by people that want you to get riled up. Manipulated by people that want to pull at your heartstrings for votes.</p>

If your an immigrant and you just came to America, last thing you want to do is stand up against the government or be a apart of any movement.

They want them to be in a perpetual state of fear, so when the people begin revolting, they will still go to work and abide by the rules. Once you look at everything from the perspective of taming the inevitable revolution, it will all begin to make perfect sense.</p>

If your an immigrant and you just came to America, last thing you want to do is stand up against your host government or be a part of any movement. This is also why they keep illegals in a constant state of limbo, never fully legalizing but also not kicking them out. They want them to be in a perpetual state of fear, so when citizens begin revolting, immigrants will still go to work and abide by the rules. This is why they want as many immigrants here as possible as the bigger the proportion, the more they can write off any movement as being a small portion of the population. </p>

<p><strong>TLDR:</strong> Once you look at everything from the perspective of taming the inevitable revolution, it will all begin to make perfect sense.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes. Kidnapping is a good word.  I don&#39;t understand how people can make post after post after post about tucson, and then look at what this admistration is doing and just not give a shit, or in most cases, think it is completely justifiable.  It proves to me that these people who care so much about child trafficking truly only care about partisan politics, not about children or their suffering.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The whole thing seems manufactured. All the ad campaigns for Father&#39;s Day were strangely positive. Not making fun of Dad for fogetting to be a basic adult or making him seem like a dunce, but very emotionally driven advertisement. It was frequent enough that it caught my eye. Cool, they&#39;re trying to make money, I get that. Then you pop on reddit and there are many anecdotal heartfelt dad stories reaching the front page. Alright, its the season, but I don&#39;t remember it being this big of deal last year or the years before that; maybe its the constant ads thats got me feeling sometype of way. Except... that video clip of the children being separated from their parents being replayed over and over again is just a black screen with a child crying out, &quot;Daddy!&quot; Now, I don&#39;t know whats going on here, but it feels like manipulation. Not a just a simple distraction, but emotional manipulation. There are so many questions that this boarder fiasco brings up, but its the fact that both sides (outside of the administration) are speaking out that makes me think its more than just saving face on Father&#39;s Day. Anytime they come together its to fuck us. So my questions from all of it is, &quot;How are they trying to fuck us this time?&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s a 100% manufactured controversy. It&#39;s like the media has a big bingo cage roller full of topics to be upset about and pulls out a new ball anytime there is no negative news. The media could easily talk about what is happening in Arizona, or record low unemployment and high jobs numbers, but they chose to talk about the migrant children thing. They could have talked about the migrant children last week, last month, or 4 years ago. Nothing has really changed. They just all got together and decided this was going to be the big story this week. If they wanted to try and smear the president they could just as easily have all talked about &quot;climate change&quot; reaching a tipping point, gun crime in America, or healthcare. As the news on the economy was so good last week, they had to have negative news to cover it up. I&#39;m guessing this next week the big news story will be &quot;ahhh the economy is going to crash&quot; due to Trump&#39;s tariff language, but we will see.</p>

It&#39;s not like Russian collusion or the piss parties where Donald can come out and say he didn&#39;t do it and that it&#39;s all media Bs. He fucking did this.

    <div class="md"><p>Maybe it is.  Although trump and sessions&#39; &quot;zero tolerance policy&quot; on immigration was posted in april, from my understanding it wasn&#39;t implemented until last october.  So my question is, although what is happening woth immigrant children is horrible, why was it not known what was happening until now?  It leads me to believe that it is possibly a distraction.  Maybe.  It&#39;s hard to say it is without something to point to to say &quot;this is what they are distracting from&quot;.</p>
