<p>UFOs go back much further than any disclosed advanced tech that could be blue beam. I would suggest you read some of Jaqcues Vallee&#39;s books on the phenomena. He offers some exotic and plausible explanations away from the extraterrestrial hypothesis. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t think there&#39;s much deceit evident in this recent movement towards disclosure. What I do think is that they are deliberately obfuscating the facts in order to have full control over the information release. This is definitely and operation that is being &quot;handled&quot; by someone still behind the curtain.</p>

<p>I mean, guys like John Greenwald have been trying to get files released via FOIA for months only to find out in the past few weeks that the program <em>wasn&#39;t</em> actually called AATIP, but some other acronym about advanced weapon systems.</p>

<p>It&#39;s sketchy but it&#39;s what I would do to keep control of a very sensitive issue, while also trying to get it out there.</p>

Unfortunately no staged alien invasion or whatever is going to do that in a lasting manner, partly because there persists certain aspects of the human condition that will exploit it, sabotage it, or otherwise corrupt it. The source of our persistent unwillingness to unite is bound to that which drives us to progress. Fair warning.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It has been speculated that in the case of the TR3B triangle craft, the light is an effect caused by the gravity repulsors. Other proposed drive systems like the counter rotating mercury drive releases this weird eldritch radiation. This is actually something demonstrable by us. Not a working drive, just spinning mercury does release strange lights. Other theories have to do with gravitic lensing of photons, causing rainbow hues.</p>

<p>I am not saying I believe any of this all the way, just interesting ideas people have postulated on the subject.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That is aggregated observation from hundreds of hrs watching UFO videos, reading books, talking to people on here and other forums. Sorry, I don&#39;t have a tidy package that explains it all.</p>

<p>I just searched &quot;ufo propulsion technologies&quot; on youtube and got a few interesting hits though, you might try that. All looks gravitic related, nothing on the mercury. But iirc, the Nazis were the ones trying the counter rotating mercury system, might try that.</p>

What the majority of people are seeing is the creation of light as an after effect of the craft&#39;s propulsion or power source. Additionally, many crafts are said to have a controllable beam of &quot;light&quot; that they can use to analyze or transport objects on the ground. Also, it would not be beyond the realm of possibility that some of these craft utilize light as a means of communication between craft. They do not have or need &quot;headlights&quot; but there are many possible reasons how/why light emitting parts of the craft could be useful to them. </p>
