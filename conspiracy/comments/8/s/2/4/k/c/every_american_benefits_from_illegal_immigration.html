Immigrants clean our houses, they watch our kids, they drive our trucks, they trim our trees, they build our buildings, they pick our produce. They do it cheap, they do it well, and they do it without complaining.</p>

<p>Are some of them actual criminals? Sure. Plenty of Americans are actual criminals, too. </p>

<p>We can talk about better ways to insure that immigrants coming here don&#39;t drain resources, don&#39;t take jobs away from natural-born Americans, and don&#39;t commit crimes. </p>

<p>But if you&#39;re talking about zero tolerance for illegal immigration, up to the point of putting children in cages and building a giant, useless wall, then we also have to talk about paying nine bucks for a bag of carrots and a grand a week for daycare. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not trying to pick a side, but the original argument like 25 years ago was that the willingness of illegal immigrants to work unskilled jobs drove down those wages, making it harder for US citizens to earn liveable wages. Part of the issue was also that a lot of the US dollars they earned were leaving the country instead of stimulating the US economy, but that&#39;s been happening, to some degree, for a while.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Salaried jobs are typically skilled positions though. With unskilled jobs, higher supply of labor means lower demand (in this case that translates to lower wages). There are smaller divisions within unskilled labor as well. Keeping with the restaurant example - that&#39;s why front of house workers, on average, make more than cooks. I&#39;m definitely not saying one job is harder than the other either. Again, I&#39;m not here to defend an opinion, just wanted to point out the other side because OP was over-generalizing.

<p>The wall that will be a Line right? As in it will have two end points? And those ends will be at two bodies of water? God I wonder how anyone will ever get around it..... oh wait maybe just go around it?</p>

<p>And if you think illegals don’t contribute in any way that can’t be easily replaced you may want to visit a real farm some time, they work for less than any American would be willing to work for and they are content doing it..... thinking they could “easily” be replaced is ignoring the reality that the American agricultural industry basically went from slave labor to underpaid immigrant labor.... </p>

<p>Hell my tiny town in the mid west more than doubles in size every fall when the migrants come to help with harvest and I can say first hand it would be nearly impossible to replace them with Americans without costing everyone a lot more at the grocery store.....</p>

<p>I’m not disagreeing that things can be done to protect American skilled labor jobs like construction, roofing, painting, cooking etc but some jobs like field hands are a win-win for everyone, if they’re happy making $0.85 for every 90lb box of oranges they pick then right on because I like being able to afford oranges..... why rock the boat with this belief that Americans will happily do these jobs they are not even applying for in the first place... </p>

<p>Which is why we need to recoup our investment even if that investment is accidental. </p>

<p>So we spend years educating people allowing them to generate money in our economy and reap the benefits, then ship them off to another country that gains from our investment. </p>

<p>Make them legal in some fashion and tax them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Firstly let me just start by saying I&#39;m a minority myself. I was born here but I&#39;m Dominican. </p>

<p>My father has a small construction business through employees he has hired throughout time are told to pay their taxes, and even the contractor he works for hires illegals and makes them pay taxes. And it&#39;s a huge multi million dollar business. </p>

<p>With that being said a lot of these guys have straight up told me that they came through border patrol checkpoints. Vast amounts of these illegals wound up close to checkpoint locations by our imagination services and were illegally allowed to enter the country by of course paying a hefty fine. Typically $5-10,000.</p>

<p>I&#39;m more than sure this type of shit goes on still. </p>

I&#39;m all for people coming to this country to make something of themselves and their families, as long as you aren&#39;t a low life piece of shit I welcome all.

<blockquote>
<p>The biggest cost shifting racket today is the use of imported labor. Recruiting, hiring and training Americans is expensive, because America is a first world society.Citizens expect first world working conditions. That makes it hard to shift labor costs onto the public, so companies prefer foreign labor. That way, they can pay lower wages and they avoid having to deal with employees who know their rights or have ideas about forming a union. Plus, foreign workers don’t sue for things like discrimination or poor safety conditions.</p>

<p>There’s a cost to this sort of predatory labor system, but those costs are shifted to the public in the form of depressed wages and high social costs. The migrants in every hospital emergency room are not having their bills picked up by their employer. When Pablo decides to get drunk and drive over an American, his employer is not paying the victim’s family or covering the cost of Pablo’s incarceration. The fact is, there is nothing more expensive to a society than cheap labor, it’s just hidden from public view.</p>
