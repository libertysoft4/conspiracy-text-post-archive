        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Long story short.  I&#39;ve never had alergies, and I&#39;ve never had a sinus infection.  </p>

<p>Within the past 2 weeks my best friend, my mom&#39;s best friend, and both of my other close friends parents ended up with sinus infections out of the blue.  These are just the people I hang out with/see the most.  First thought was allergies or whatever but once I heard that NONE of them have ever had a sinus infection before it hit me as somewhat odd.</p>

<p>My friends parents live halfway across the country which I find REALLY weird.  My friend was saying her mom has NEVER had one before and felt like death for like a week or so, basically same exact symptoms.</p>

<p>It didn&#39;t strike me to post this until I just saw this  video (I don&#39;t watch this stuff I just ended up here after googling xxx&#39;s death out of boredom).</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTQD-J31vmE">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTQD-J31vmE</a> </p>

<p>The video wasn&#39;t too odd until he mentioned he had a sinus infection.  I checked the date which was like a week or two ago.  Was just curious if anyone else has had this same thought.</p>

<p>Would love to hear your thoughts.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I mean sinus infections aren&#39;t really related to allergies.  Similar symptoms and allergies can definitely facilitate one, but not the same animal.   What better time to release a virus than say right when everyone is getting allergies right?  Most people wouldn&#39;t even notice unless it got out of hand.  Idk the timing of everything has just seemed a bit odd to me.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I get sinus infections every year when the weather changes from cold to warm or vice versa. There are a bunch of random factors that can contribute to an infection. If you&#39;re in North America, there&#39;s a sizable heat wave going on, which leads to a lot of pollutants lingering in the air, particularly with heavy humidity. Lots of pollen-producing vegetation begin their cycles around this time as well. Could also just be that someone&#39;s had one before and never got it diagnosed as such. Most likely, it&#39;s just a weird coincidence. It reminds me of the <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seattle_windshield_pitting_epidemic">Great Seattle Windshield Epidemic. </a></p>

<p>Try lightly spraying your nose with a steroid spray (don&#39;t overuse it cause it causes extreme dryness) and then washing it off with isotonic solution (iv fluid or just use a seawater spray). If you get dry after washing your nose try applying some coconut oil or petrol jelly with an earbud on the inside of your nostrils</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I find it to be the WEIRDEST thing atm.  Just doesn&#39;t make sense how my friends in the mid west, south and myself in the Northeast are all getting hit with this at the same exact time.  If it were a month apart I would say oh maybe there&#39;s just something going around.  But it was all within like a week or two of one another.  Maybe we were sprayed with something over the winter but we weren&#39;t effected by the until the warmth brought everything to fruition?  Idk seems weird.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>C (in large doses, think 2000-8000 mg) plus cold medicine is really the best option. Antibiotics are 50/50, since an infection could be viral or bacterial, and by the time you get lab results it usually has healed naturally. Plus antibiotics probably do more harm than good anyway.</p>

I may actually have to visit the doctor over this, which is a rare thing indeed. I&#39;ll give it a few more days, though.</p>

It doesnt matter how not allergic you are if you get a piece of pollen in your sinuses and it doesnt get out it will lead to an infection. Especially compined with dryer cavities that crack </p>

<p>Allergies, ADD, Autism...think about it...do you remember every seeing anyone with a sinus infection in the 70s? I&#39;m sure it happened but to nearly everyone?</p>

<p>Think about how many birds, insects and other wildlife you grew up with.  Look outside. Isn&#39;t it quiet?  Do you still see bees, june bugs, fireflies, or butterflies?</p>
