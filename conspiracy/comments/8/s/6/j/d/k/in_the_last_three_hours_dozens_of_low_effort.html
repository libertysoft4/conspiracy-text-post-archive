<p>The XXXTentacion threads were so many. And then there are these low-effort threads that don&#39;t even make any sense. Why?</p>

<p>Because whenever a topic they don&#39;t want you to know about makes it to the top, they start flooding the sub with all this garbage. Just look at the new tab and see all the threads made in just three hours. If you&#39;re a regular here, you don&#39;t see that much activity on average. Maybe I&#39;m wrong. But I feel it&#39;s a sliding maneuver. They don&#39;t want you to see certain threads.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Idk man the post that debunked the Obama pic was made by a user with very questionable post and comments.  Anti abortion memes and 23 and me shit. Had a ridiculous amount of karma.  </p>

<p>That pic from burning man was a tan white guy with a white colored outfit on in the middle of the desert. The original was a black man in a blue outfit with trees in the back ground. Trust me there are no trees at burning man and you definite don&#39;t wear a heavy coat like his friend was wearing. Once I saw that I was convinced that it is being pushed as a topic and I feel like that pic was real.  Someone is trying to convince people it&#39;s fake. </p>

<p>Sorry I know this post wasn&#39;t just about that but needed to vent. I get frustrated around here these days. </p>

<p>Really? Because all I&#39;ve seen are people trying to prove it real with zero proof. The debunking thread actually had proof. I&#39;ve seen so much effort to try to knock that thread out of the top spot in the last 5 hours alone. Why is this so important? Who cares if an ex-president is wearing that if he actually was. I don&#39;t think he wore it and it&#39;s ridiculous people are saying he did with no proof not even an additional photo of him wearing it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I mean yeah things go viral sometimes and spread. People want to talk about it. Then the bots come and clean up. I have seen no evidence of photoshopping and looked at the different layers and filters. There are no artifacts.  All the time stamps and tweets lineup to when Obama was In Chicago during the inauguration.  Several connections were made to the girl that posted and high level government officials. </p>

<p>And you are right it&#39;s stupid and it really doesn&#39;t matter or mean anything, but it peaks my interest when an agenda to discredit it pops up by a user with questionable usage posting it. Then pulls a lot of randoms and upvotes hovering around the top. This was the only thing I came across so far that was even close to discrediting it other than people just saying it&#39;s not real and name calling. The theory they had that was the same guy from burning man was Swiss cheese. Maybe you were talking about other posts though idk</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I saw that link. It doesn&#39;t show anything. Just &quot;class and grace&quot;. But there&#39;s no actual proof. I don&#39;t see Obama wearing the headdress, being with Artur with Artur wearing the jacket. Obama ever mentioning that designer of the headdress. The debunking thread had the photographer show Michel Madie wearing the outfit. He had a Baphomet article on him and he dressed as a goat man before. His features are even similar to the one in the picture. How is that not more convincing than the one you provided in the link?</p>

<p>LOL yes. That is hard to believe. And your lack of evidence (even questionable evidence!) doesn&#39;t help. How does a picture of the instagram girl outside the public part of the White House grounds (taking a picture with the House behind her, like literally millions have) turn into proof of her being so close to the president she travels with him?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Because it it is far more scientific and that&#39;s how my brain works. Checking timestamps looking for artifacts. The fact that it&#39;s not the same color, the guy is white with a shadow on his face and he is in the desert. She labeled it class and grace. The creator is still selling the same costume 3 years after the pick from burning man and she still has one for sale meaning multiple people have them. It isn&#39;t one of a kind. I linked you a tweet she made to a comment asked her about the pick. She isn&#39;t denying it&#39;s him. It would be so much easier to just say it&#39;s not him and she hasn&#39;t. I think she may be a mind controlled sex slave like Sara Ashcroft was. When that thing started going around I didn&#39;t even care because it doesn&#39;t matter. But now I see a push because it scares them so I&#39;m interested </p>

<p>I&#39;m sorry I really am grateful for the work you put into proving it to me. But I don&#39;t see any concrete proof. Not even with the class and grace one.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I mean it&#39;s cool man.  It&#39;s like when the pedogate thing started. It got to a point where there was to much info saying it was real and you can&#39;t convince it&#39;s not. It&#39;s a balancing act for me and there is just far to much on saying it&#39;s real than it&#39;s not. I did just have an idea. I am going to find the guy from burning man and ask him it&#39;s it him. Should be easy I got his name </p>

<p>No. No there isn&#39;t. There&#39;s no concrete proof. Yet there is for Michel Madie. Go ahead, he has a facebook and you can message him. Good luck.</p>
