        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I&#39;ll be the first to admit that I don&#39;t know Alex Jones&#39; entire legacy. From what I hear, it&#39;s not all so bad. In the last couple years, he has been so off the rails, that I wonder whether he could be an artificial archetype for conspiracy theorists used to discredit all conspiracy theorists. Perhaps governmental involvement. </p>

<p>We have all 3 branches of government republican controlled, and he releases what has to be the most contrived reaction to the US having bombers attack Syria. I&#39;d love to hear when Alex got into Syrian politics. Geopolitics and the US election aside, why does he automatically care so much to want to shut off the feed that ended up getting uploaded to YouTube without him complaining?</p>

<p><a href="https://youtu.be/1mGw9mBVNUc">https://youtu.be/1mGw9mBVNUc</a></p>

<p>On top of this, you have him acting legitimately ridiculous when covering a story of drag queens teaching children to read. However you feel about the true story, it&#39;s hard to deny how over the top Alex is: </p>

<p><a href="https://youtu.be/fyjO47d23no">https://youtu.be/fyjO47d23no</a></p>

<p>I&#39;m not a regular on infowars, personally, because I think it&#39;s been infiltrated. I&#39;ve tried to be as unbiased as possible.</p>

<p>I&#39;m sure there is more evidence to support and more evidence to refute my claim, but I think it&#39;s a worthy topic to discuss in the r/conspiracy community. I&#39;d love to see the evidence on both sides. To be clear, I don&#39;t generally prefer to support a presidential candidate based on party. Fuck em both. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>yeah that&#39;s fucked up. But I definitely would like to get more context. Do you have any links or anything that shows him saying why he did it?</p>

<p>Thing is, he doesn&#39;t do this regularly, which if he was, then cointelpro would makes sense. But a one time thing, that doesnt necessarily mean he&#39;s a psy op</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I stay the fuck away from anything to do with Alex Jones, so I don&#39;t have any other links, but to the best of my knowledge, he hasn&#39;t said anything about the gun rally.</p>

<p>But as far as it being a one-time thing, I have no idea why he did it, because it totally exposed himself. If I had to guess, he was just taking orders, and they told him to go cause some chaos at the local gun rally so that the media coverage of the event could tell the public that the &quot;crazy conspiracy theorist Alex Jones&quot; rants and raves about gun control, to associate pro-2A people with crazy conspiracy theorists. It was a huge fuck up on the part of the deep state and they probably quickly realized this when it went videos came out. If he did it regularly, there would be a lot more video of him exposing himself, and his show would obviously not be successful. </p>

<p>His job is to give people who already subscribe to conspiracies limited information, and make everyone else think he and all other &quot;conspiracy theorists&quot; are bat shit insane. </p>

<p>Look at what they say about Alex Jones. He is the go-to conspiracy theorist for the media. Do you really want a ranting raving lunatic representing us? Someone truly concerned with waking up the public to the atrocities committed by our government would absolutely know that acting like that is like the WORST thing you could do.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Alex Jones may not be the real deal anymore at this point, but it&#39;s imo understandable to at least have some residue of respect for what the man&#39;s done in the past. I am of course biased, as I loved his parts in the Waking Life and A Scanner Darkly, and his Bohemian Grove docu was my entry into that rabbit hole. For that AJ will always have some cred with me, not to mention all the other docus he made/produced from 00-09, which all had at least some truth and eye opening moments in them. Just for all that I think he at least started out genuine, he seems though to have become more of a snake oil salesman and disinfo agent the last couple of years. The man did contribute greatly to the side of truth seekers however, if only for the amount of people that had their minds opened up by the subjects he broaches, to realize the extent we&#39;re being played with by TPTB. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>How insulting. Hicks was the real deal, a political revolutionary who was genuinely funny, advocated deep psychedelic experiences on mushrooms and was very familiar with Terence McKenna&#39;s work. Here&#39;s Bill Hicks on the topic of government conspiracy:

    <div class="md"><p>First, it&#39;s important to understand that his mission is to corral conspiracy theorists into following him and his viewpoints, ie be an effective gatekeeper. The government can&#39;t stop everyone from believing conspiracies. What they can do is control where they get their info. </p>

<p>His first approach was from the left as Bill Hicks. This was somewhat successful. Interestingly, there&#39;s a video of Hicks doing a right-wing radio host character a la Rush Limbaugh with a gravelly voice and everything. </p>

<p>Bill Hicks dies tragically. Some time later, Alex Jones appears on the scene. When you look at his early work, he wasn&#39;t as far right as he is today. He was more anti-government overall. </p>

<p>Anyhow, it&#39;s an interesting theory with some pretty compelling evidence, but of course it&#39;s just a theory. Just don&#39;t dismiss it out of hand because it sounds crazy, because truth is stranger than fiction. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You need to get used to the idea that the powers that be, officialdom, and the mainstream media, will all try to dismiss and make any and every conspiracy appear to be &quot;ridiculous&quot; even when there is more than enough evidence for any right thinking person to take them seriously...</p>

<p>and like Lenin said &quot;The best way to beat the opposition is <em>to be the opposition</em>&quot; so I seriously question just how much of the so-called opposition really is genuine no matter how credible they are or how popular they seem to be. </p>

<p>In fact the more credible ad popular they are the more likely they actually are to be a part of that controlled opposition.</p>

<p>Now the most serious conspiracies like the JFK, MLK, RFK assassinations already demonstrate that the people behind those were absolutely ruthless with a long string of other highly questionable deaths that followed them that silenced all kinds of people who knew certain details or facts about those events that no one else did. How ruthless do you suppose the ones behind 9/11 who&#39;d deliberately murder 3,000 ordinary people simply going about their business are?</p>

<p>Now if Alex Jones represented any kind of a real threat or danger to the people behind any of the conspiracies he dwells on and raves on and on about they&#39;d shut him up and shut him down in no time flat. The same goes for a whole host of others who make a living off peddling a variety of different and conflicting versions of the conspiracies themselves.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I had a discussion some time ago about a chemical being released into the environment that was feminizing frogs. Alex has long been saying the water was making the frogs gay, which is not totally correct, but close enough to correct I really wondered what his spin was about. The water was making it more likely that the frogs would be born as females. Adjustment of the prenatal hormones, I believe. Why say the frogs are turning gay? Just seems like he took the raw facts of the situation and turned it into the most inflammatory way to describe it. What&#39;s easier to refute as a relatively uninformed consumer- there&#39;s a large corporation dumping chemicals in the water system that is affecting the frog population&#39;s prenatal hormones to the point that they&#39;re breeding mostly females, or TPTB are turning the frogs gay. It just screams distraction and disinformation. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I always have to laugh when I see homosexuality and depopulation conflated. They seem to forget that attraction to the opposite sex is not a requirement for reproduction <em>or</em> child rearing. Currently opposite sex couples in America are only twice as likely per capita to be raising children as same sex couples. Where there&#39;s a will, there&#39;s a way.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Indeed. Propaganda in all its forms are frightening enough once you witness the effectiveness at massaging people&#39;s desire to identify in a society run by individualism.

<p>Looked at jones&#39; twitter yesterday and saw his promotion of the Fonda tweet. So many people overlooked the context that I simply could not believe it was organic. What I saw on jones&#39; feed confirmed that even those who claim to be against &quot;fake news&quot; will still chug from a different flavor of kool aid. The only difference is that they are more unaware they are doing so, and actively claim they are too smart for that. </p>

Indeed. xD</p>

<p>It will be hard to verify 100% a this time. There are only the chan threads that uncovered this left to verify, but the proof those chan threads link to doesn&#39;t exist anymore since the website where Alex stole the pic from took down this pic in the meantime and also did Alex take down the video where he was crying about this pic.</p>

<p>Alex was showing a picture of a girl sitting in front of a piano, but the lower half of the pic was blacked out, because it was &quot;too disturbing and explicit to show to you.&quot; Then he cried about how fucked up this is. (claimed it came from Anthony Weiner&#39;s laptop I think)
The chans cropped and reverse searched that image and found it on a site advertising for piano lessons.
Girl was just sitting there in underware, but not at all explicit or even suggestive in any way.</p>

<p>You probably can still find the chan posts by googling for keywords like &quot;Alex jones fake cp piano lesson&quot;</p>

<p>I would help out but with my current internet connection it would take me for ever.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Alex has been around since the early 90&#39;s at least. He has actually done some pretty decent work over the years. His bohemian grove expose was actually really good. Today however, I genuinely question his sanity. The type of outlandish shit that comes out of his mouth nowadays, and his over the top baptist televangelist preacher/ wwf wrestler / cartoon baffoonery / yelling persona is completely repulsive. I dont know if he was infiltrated at some point or if he was just CIA plant from day one. Sometimes I think he is just character acting as a form of ironic/absurdist comedy.</p>

<p>He s clearly a disinformationist of the highest caliber. For the past few years, even before this last election, he had lost any credibility in my eyes. Based on the knowledge he previously revealed about the levels of corruption in both parties, and the corruption of the US gov&#39;t system as a whole, it&#39;s kind of surprising to see how he has become so partisan. He&#39;s really trying hard to push the narrative that Trump is this rogue maverick that is genuinely for the people. We will see in time he&#39;s just like all the others before him, (but thats a whole different topic) Alex really used to come across as somewhat open minded and nonpartisan. </p>

<p>He gained some legit influence and popularity over time, and mainstream exposure and exposing conspiracies just dont mix well. He probably figured out it&#39;s a lot more profitable to push a specific political agenda then it is to just educate and inform for the sake of educating and informing.</p>

<p>He&#39;s really ended up doing a lot of damage to all conspiracy movements. People tend to oversimplify things and think in stereotypes. So now anytime you offer any alternate theories or question official versions of events the only comparison that is in most peoples minds is the most popular conspiracy theorist, so the response is, &quot;oh, your just one of those Alex Jones types.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>His New World Order videos, particularly Endgame, are pretty good summary documentaries for when you&#39;re first stepping into the rabbit hole, and I really liked his appearances in Waking Life and A Scanner Darkly. He&#39;s certainly a gateway/gatekeeper but really everybody interprets everything on their own. With Alex Jones there is nothing too extreme or out there just like on Coast to Coast - it&#39;s easy to say there&#39;s either covert support coming to him from the establishment because they&#39;re controlling him, or that they merely tolerate him because of how radicalizing he is, - but I would personally like to think that he&#39;s genuine and simply imperfect because he&#39;s trying to appeal to the simpleton average American.</p>

However, I think he&#39;s a profiteer, whose father was a fire and brimstone preachers, not actually a government agent.

    <div class="md"><p>Exactly. He was a local crank in Austin, on the public-access channel. The Austin filmmaker Richard Linklater found him so over the top that he made bit roles for Jones (in the animated/rotoscoped movies &quot;A Scanner Darkly&quot; and &quot;Waking Life&quot;). The British documentary filmmaker/journalist Jon Ronson included Jones in a British documentary and accompanying book, &quot;Them: Adventures With Extremists.&quot; This gave Alex Jones some valuable visibility, and during the Bush 43 presidency and many scandals/outrages (Katrina, Iraq, etc.) Jones got a lot of web traffic. But his material was too overblown to get good advertising even during the blog boom of the mid/late 2000s. He saw the advertisers that *did* want to sponsor his podcast and websites, and they were sketchy little companies selling vitamin supplements and &quot;prepper&quot; supplies. So he started branding this stuff himself and selling it mail-order out of his Texas office. That&#39;s his whole business.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>He&#39;s great. Been following him since about 2000. He won me over with his exposé of bohemian grove and being ok with his vhs tapes being copied to spread the message as long as they were given away for free. You have to realize that a lot of conspiracy stuff was consumed by small print books and VHS tapes before the prevalence of the internet and conspiracy theorists were pretty copyright centric but AJ just wanted the message spread. </p>

<p>He&#39;s sensationalist in his presentation for sure but you kinda have to be on radio to avoid being boring. Real conspiracy research is dates, places, names and very very boring. So his style is meant to be engaging. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You gotta understand that given the nature of the very conspiracies he describes, people like AJ would be out there to discredit these conspiracies. </p>

<p>I know it&#39;s hard to believe, but there&#39;s a reason all these people in the thread are saying he&#39;s one of the bad guys.</p>

<p>Maybe this video will help. He shows up at a pro 2nd amendment rally in his hometown of Austin, TX and randomly starts yelling crazy stuff in his bullhorn while there was another guy leading the rally trying to speak to the crowd. </p>

<p>The crowd complains that they can&#39;t hear the speaker, and begging him to stop. They even were trying to get him to come up and speak in front of the crowd because they thought he was on their side. </p>

<p>He kept just yelling random nonsense and almost ended up in physical fights with people there, and the guy leading the rally said that they were going to have to stop the rally because &quot;someone doesn&#39;t want to play nice&quot;, obviously referring to Jones drowning out the speaker.</p>

<p>People from the rally caught on pretty quick and called him out as a disinfo agent, and said &quot;you&#39;re not part of the team!&quot; &quot;you&#39;re a provocateur&quot; &quot;proof that AJ is working for the bad guys&quot; etc.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqNKUvCQFok">Here&#39;s the video.</a> It&#39;s probably the best evidence, if not proof that he&#39;s a deepstate shill. </p>

<p>People like to complain about the editing job of the video, but don&#39;t let that distract you from what&#39;s going on.</p>

<p>It&#39;s clear as day if you watch the whole thing.</p>

<p>Sure he&#39;s entertaining and maybe that&#39;s how he has become so popular. But I honestly think he does more harm then good. Peddling horrible products at an extreme mark up.

    <div class="md"><p>More of the royal you. I need to transition away from that, posting on the internet, never really speaking to just one person, so I use &#39;you&#39; interchangibly from general for everyone to directly reference a previous poster. Which is the same shortfalls as trying to show emotions or sarcasm via text. Never works right, everyone has their own interpretations of the words. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve met him several times and used to listen to his show a lot around 2001-2006. While he is a natural showman and intense radio personality, he&#39;s not faking it. He believes what he says. His jumping on the Trump train I found a bit out of character for him, so I don&#39;t know if he struck some kind of deal. Although, I do get the fact that AJ has always been anti-establishment and Trump was not the establishment choice for president, so he&#39;s got some common ground. I don&#39;t share his worldview and find his forever-doomsday vibe a turnoff, nevertheless, his show has served as a powerful tool for whistleblowers and journalists exposing parts of the news that don&#39;t and won&#39;t get reported on by the mainstream. Of course, like anything, you have to take it all with lots of salt. The guy is/was on the radio something like 6 hours a day for the last 15 whatever years, so yeah. He&#39;s &quot;on record&quot; saying lots. He&#39;s not right all the time, and his ego gets in his way. Still, he&#39;s been proven right about many important things (and of course wrong about many things too)</p>
