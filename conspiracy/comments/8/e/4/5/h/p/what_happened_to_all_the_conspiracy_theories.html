<p>I think people are talking about it less of late because there has not been as much &quot;news&quot; lately by the Left/Establishment promoting the agenda.  Of course, they are still trying to push to have the United States join the Paris accord and whatnot.  But talk of that has died down after Trump rejected it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;What if we switch to renewables and make the world a better place for nothing?! It&#39;s all a big hoax, may as well keep buying oil!&quot;</p>

<p>You&#39;re so convinced that the conspiracy is &quot;Solar/renewable energy  investors want money and will lie to get it!&quot; when I think it&#39; just as likely (more likely, in my opinion) to be &quot;Oil investors have money and will lie to keep it!&quot;</p>

<p>I only replied because you take your own judgement of climate change to be universal fact, which is laughable. I think it&#39;s real, but even if it&#39;s not I believe renewable energy is best. So even if I&#39;m wrong, I still hold my main belief. What if you&#39;re wrong?</p>

<p>Karl Popper famously said, “A theory that explains everything explains nothing.” So what do you make of the theory that catastrophic manmade CO2-driven “climate change” can account for harsher winters and lighter winters, more snow and less snow, droughts and floods, more hurricanes and less hurricanes, more rain and less rain, more malaria and less malaria, saltier seas and less salty seas, Antarctica ice melting and Antarctic ice gaining and dozens of other contradictions? Popper gave a name to “theories” like this: pseudoscience.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Utter bullshit.</p>

<p>Climate is a chaotic system. In chaotic systems there are islands of stability in which finely balanced variables result in relatively stable and predictable outcomes.</p>

<p>If any of those variables change, however, the system goes out of equilibrium and descends back into chaos, with the effects becoming much more random and unstable.</p>

<p>That&#39;s what is happening with climate - a relatively stable system is becoming more and more chaotic because we are changing one of the variables.</p>

<p>Global Warming is the cause, Climate Change is the effect, and that is exactly what scientists have been saying from the beginning.</p>

<p>Err... no... that&#39;s not true at all and is nothing but evidence of your own ignorance.</p>

<p>Ice cores are added to many other proxies to generate an average over a large area... the ice cores are not the <em>only</em> record, but simply one of many including tree rings, corals, and ocean and lake sediments.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>But then the argument is that we can never have enough samples to approximate the average, which is just wrong. There is an (unknown, perhaps impossibly large) amount of data that could allow us to reliably extrapolate an average global temperature. Whether or not we have collected that amount of data, that is up for debate.</p>

<p>It&#39;s not about whether or not we can collect data that supports / refutes climate change. It&#39;s about how much data we have collected that supports or refutes it, and the relative amount of each. We can always find data to support whatever we want, what is important is collect as much as you can for your idea and compare it to the evidence against your idea. OP dismisses each piece of evidence individually without acknowledging: A) the number of observations in each data source and B) the agreement between data sources. If someone has millions of observations across multiple different sources, that&#39;s a good basis to approximate/ predict.  (&quot;Millions of observations...&quot; is purely hypothetical and not supposed to represent the amount of evidence for or against climate change)</p>
