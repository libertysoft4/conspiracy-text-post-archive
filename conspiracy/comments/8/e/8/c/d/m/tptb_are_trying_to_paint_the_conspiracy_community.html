        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>The title essentially says it all, but this is something that weighs on me heavily, and I feel it needs to be expanded upon.</p>

<p>Yes, I think part of this orchestrated finale&#39; divide and conquer strategy requires lots of politicization from the media and the social engineers.</p>

<p>Obviously, the people who&#39;s job it is to monitor this sub, and assess the stuff we talk about, are aware of the large following we have gotten following the Pizzagate developments. If the stuff we talk about and discuss here, and the sources and information we share became &quot;mainstream&quot;, it would be detrimental to TPTB. So, they have determined that a really great way to discredit us, would be to simply brand us as this uglier, crazier extension of the Rep. party, who are motivated to take down democrats with our wild Pizza shop sex ring witch hunt. This is being done by design to create animosity and tension from the liberals, onto us. The liberals still largely trust in the state, we need to be able to reach them and red pill them. The shills are protecting that from happening by politicizing us as alt right.</p>

<p>Since it was the Clinton camp who was implicated in John Podesta&#39;s emails (he himself being the chairman of her campaign). It only made sense for the social engineers to paint us as a &quot;radical alt right group that is politically motivated to put Clinton in jail&quot;.</p>

<p>Let&#39;s not forget that our &quot;buddy&quot; Alex Jones, a man who once stood against the notion of wealthy and preselected political puppets, fully endorsed Trump in 2016. AJ has been a big face of the conspiracy culture for a long time. Many of us believe he is a limited hangout/controlled opposition. Is it possible that he (after years of getting the trust of his supporters and listeners), had been instructed to lead his massive following toward a &quot;False Prophet&quot;?</p>

<p>The conspiracy culture/community is notorious for being skeptical of government. It seemed to me very out of character for Jones to blatantly endorse a political nominee who wasn&#39;t consistent with the constitution and Bill of rights as Ron Paul was. By politicizing our movement as &quot;right wing&quot; and the stuff we talk about and try to expose as &quot;politically motivated&quot;, it immediately dilutes the value of what we stand for, and discredits us. They immediately cut the amount of people we can reach in half (the entire left) by branding us as a conservative fuck fest.</p>

<p>Also, it&#39;s important to note, considering how Trump has been portrayed by the media as racist (especially by liberals), and as a sexist pig, WE will be looked at as racist and sexist for being associated with Trump. Jones doesn&#39;t ever seem to address this for some reason, and it is a huge concern of mine. The CTR campaign is updated and filled in on the agenda, I&#39;m seeing them prop up this narrative and labeling us as a Trump bee hive all the time.</p>

<p>My point is, the social engineers are very intelligent and know what they are doing. What is the long term effect of this? Can we try to come up with a way to reverse it? Do what you can to call out shills that try to push this shit. We need to be able to reach people on both the left and the right, and they are trying to prevent that from happening with this clever political psy op.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That’s exactly what The Young Turks does. They cover way too many stories of right wing violence and incidents of racism that just do not happen very much on the grand scale of things. </p>

<p>Conspiracy Minded People most definitely lean right. It is the leftists that have the most faith in the Mainstream Media and it is the leftists that parrot talking points from the mainstream media such as Trump Russia collusion and climate change and the idea that Assad gassed his own people. The mainstream media is clearly the most elitist, corporate, capitalistic, owned by bankers news that there is and it is leftists that tend to parrot the Neoliberal talking points from the mainstream media. Sure capitalism is a conspiracy theory but you act like there is no socialism conspiracy theories, when we can clearly see that more and more people are becoming dependent on government aid. More and more people need welfare. The idea of a Universal basic income and universal health care is very popular on the left. The left literally wants to expand government, the same government responsible for imperialism. </p>

<p>I would never support SJW’s. You do realize that there is an extreme overrepresentation of Jewish people on the executive boards of the biggest banks right? And SJW’s, leftists, progressives spend more time and energy focusing on the people that point that fact out AKA “Evil NAZIS” instead of actually covering the predatory practices of big banks, and the completely inhumane Banker bailouts, and corruption within the federal reserve and the effects of fractional reserve banking on the economy. SJWs work for the big banks. They are a product of mainstream propaganda that was paid for by big bankers. Look how you have hundreds of idiot leftist protesters at a Ben Shapiro speech and none of them are out protesting big banks and big corporations. Millions march in opposition to Donald Trumps “sexism” and none of you come out of your shells when he wants to strike a sovereign country in Syria based on a pack of lies. </p>

<p>I can’t even with you people, you leftists are so stupid. Alex Jones is completely right about you guys. You absolutely hate the Constitution and Americanism and you are pawns for the international bankers and the people that wish to control us. </p>

<p>Objectively speaking, Social Democracy has the best track record.  If you ask socialists, that&#39;s capitalism, and if you ask capitalists, that&#39;s socialist, but its certainly well to the left of the current US.  And while I&#39;m not a fan of Leninism, its intellectually dishonest to directly compare the performance of two systems when one had to start from scratch while the other a) enjoys the accumulated loot of continents, and b) only functions thanks to the continuing exploitation of large swathes of the globe whose grinding poverty never gets factored into the verdict.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Liberal =/= leftist (nice goalpost shifting), SJW is an empty strawperson, and progressive is vague to the point of meaninglessness.  Call him whatever epithets you want; his economic policy was not left-wing.</p>

<p>Got a source on this actually happening?  I&#39;m not disagreeing C-16 allows for penalties, I&#39;m saying that simply misgendering someone isn&#39;t a violation of it.  Go back and reread the bill, you&#39;re way off base here.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Don&#39;t worry, I vote early and often, and bring a busload of undocumented immigrants with me each time I go to the polls.  Seriously though, someone with as tenuous a grasp on reality as you have really shouldn&#39;t be voting.  Unlike you though, I don&#39;t hope the coercive force of the system prevents the people I disagree with from exercising their franchise.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t see any party advocating anything like this.  Some services are socialized, such as defense, education and roadbuilding.  Health should be, but ObamaCare really just means handing government money to private services.</p>

<p>Great! Now, here: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_programs_in_the_United_States">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_programs_in_the_United_States</a>. If anything, the US truly lacks a &quot;Right Wing&quot;, which would be Conservative (ie. less government, and more personal liberties/freedoms). </p>

<p>We have Central Economic Planning, and a plethora of Social Programs, both are Socialist-Marxist. So, we do have a &quot;left wing&quot; in the US, and most Democrats and Republicans adhere to it (unbeknownst to them - the goal)</p>

<p>Eh, see above. The US government is a Frankenstein of Socialism and Fascism, but, they are both one in the same, tbh. Ayn Rand succinctly summed it up:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>[F]ascism and communism are not two opposites, but two rival gangs fighting over the same territory—both are variants of statism, based on the collectivist principle that man is the rightless slave of the state.</p>

<p>They are nothing like the same.   Fascism entrenches social class and social differences, and puts political power in the hands of the capitalists.  Socialism entrenches power in the hands of the government, with no room for large privately-owned corporations.</p>

<p>Yes, they are. They are Statist Collectivist ideas, just wrapped and presented differently. Same ends, though.</p>

<p>Communism/Marxism/Socialism, does the same, but flips it, and puts lipstick on it. </p>

<p>This is when the Government becomes the Corporation, and becomes tyrannical. It&#39;s quite literally one in the same. Wolf in Sheep&#39;s clothing.</p>

<p>That&#39;s because you guys constantly move goal posts, and screech &quot;Not true Socialism!&quot;. Think about it for a second... Something so abstract can only favor those wish to do harm, not good. Y&#39;all are being played like a fiddle.</p>

<p>You know how conspiracy theorists say: &quot;Bankers/TPTB play both sides?&quot;. Yeah, this applies here, more than ever. Fascism and Communism are one in the same. Both used as &quot;boogeyman&quot; and &quot;opponents&quot; at various strategic points in time. </p>

<p>No, they are not.</p>

<p>Fascism is still based upon strong property rights, capitalism and private ownership of the means of production. Property rights under Socialism are moot, the state can acquire whatever it wants.</p>

<p>No, Fascism is government colluding with private industry, but government, the ultimate controllers. </p>

<p>Not really, actually. Take a look at the debt. That&#39;s like saying your neighbor who put everything on credit is more wealthy than the neighbor who has actual sayings, but little to no &quot;fancy toys&quot;.</p>

<p>The bigger the government, the more income disparity. Fact. Look at the stats.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, profits are still privatised while losses are socialised. That&#39;s not &quot;socialism&quot;.</p>

<p>IMHO the old definitions don&#39;t really work to describe the current reality adequate so people see something which doesn&#39;t fit into their idea of what socialism or capitalism is and vice versa.</p>

<p>Like the inverted totalitarianism concept by Chris Hedges the same inversion happened with capitalistic and socialistic methods.</p>

<p>Classic socialism ideas like Monopoly laws have vanished for instance and these days Google/FB &quot;should&quot; have been classic examples of companies who should be dismantled.</p>

<p>Then we have distorted form of crony capitalism where there seems to be some socialistic understanding for the people inside the group which switch between these favoured corporations and the state. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>My spidey sense tells me that this is pure GARBAGE. Alex Jones has done more to wake up America then anyone else I can think of. </p>

<p>Donald Trump has always been a New York outsider who &quot;TPTB&quot; has tried to take down several times. </p>

<p>People are starting to judge people by what they do and not what they are labeled. </p>

<p>There is a MAJOR attack on Alex Jones and Donald Trump that is 100% coming from the top  aka &quot;TPTB&quot; as you generically coin it. </p>

<p>Something major is coming and they don&#39;t want Alex to have a platform. Trump is the real deal and our only hope. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Is it not fair to say that trump <em>is</em> selling your country out, considering his appointments of people like Scott Pruitt who ruthlessly exploit American taxpayer money for personal gain, his facilitating of clear quid pro quos between his son in law and foreign states to the tune of billions of dollars, his own personal milking of taxpayer money for golfing trips, the quid pro quo between Sinclair Broadcasting and his administration, etc...</p>

<p>Surely if trump was your only chance against America being sold out, he wouldn&#39;t be actively selling it out himself?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Pruitt is an example of someone appointed by Trump, in which they <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-04-11/first-class-problem-pressure-mounts-over-epa-chief-s-spending">abused taxpayer funded expenses</a> only to be <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2018/04/08/trump-defends-embattled-epa-chief-scott-pruitt.html">defended by Trump</a>. Thus Trump is facilitating someone who is exploiting the American taxpayer, as Trump himself does by <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2018/01/20/trumps-travel-costs-during-his-first-year-exceed-13-million-dollars.html">spending millions on golfing trips</a> (I thought he was a &quot;billionnaire&quot;? Why does he need to take money from the American public?)</p>

<p>You&#39;ll have to enlighten me as to what the &quot;bigger picture here&quot; is. Because for all available evidence, as far as I can see, Donald Trump is doing nothing in terms of <em>not</em> selling out the US, whereas there is plenty of evidence that he is <strong>actively selling it out</strong>. I didn&#39;t even mention the GOP tax bill before. Trump has added an expected  trillion+ dollars to the national debt, while making the rich richer (including himself and his family!) at the expense of the children of tomorrow, who you say he is the only hope for? Can you explain that contradiction?</p>

<p>And for &quot;the children&#39;s future&quot;, surely the best defender is someone who actually believes in Climate Change, who believes in science, not someone who takes active measures towards ruining our ability to survive on the planet?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Pruitt’s EPA has eliminated regulations that:</p>

<p>Verified emissions from a company’s industrial expansion are what the company says they are. (Now the EPA will simply take estimates at face value.) <a href="http://src.bna.com/uM7">http://src.bna.com/uM7</a></p>

<p>Required data collection of emissions from oil and gas companies.</p>

<p>Required companies to disclose which hazardous chemicals they’re storing.</p>

<p>Banned the toxic pesticide chlorpyrifos.</p>

<p>Protected tributaries of sensitive bodies of water (even though the EPA’s analysis showed it would cost less to prevent the pollution than to allow it) </p>

<p>Repealed the Clean Power act. (this might not be as bad as it seems, I don&#39;t really know how this negatively impacted the US)</p>

<p>I honestly couldn&#39;t be arsed to go through a shit ton of pdfs to find the relevant passages for each one but a simple google search will confirm. </p>

<p>This is before you even get into his background about all the shady shit he has been caught doing while shilling <strong>hard</strong> for Big industry of which he was an integral part. </p>

<p>You can go on and on and on finding shit like this.</p>

<p>From my understanding, the EPA was a bloated mess and needed trimming down, if this is all he was doing then fine, but to ignore all the other shit he is doing is just willful ignorance.</p>

<p>This took me like 30 seconds to find. I don&#39;t believe you are a stupid person so I can only assume you knew all this and either couldn&#39;t give a shiit or are just trying to make me out to be a liar for some other agenda. </p>

My point was not to defend Pruit or the other user, but simply to point out that telling people to look it up is a weak response to someone challenging your claims. The point is to have a discussion, right? You make a claim, I challenge it, you provide a source or an example of said claim, and then I respond with an analysis.

<p>I am fine for having a discussion about anything with anyone, I don&#39;t ascribe to the whole split the public dynamic. People are people and there and good and bad people in all walks of life. I don&#39;t make assumptions on this just because of what they do and what their politics are.</p>

<p>I disliked you accused me of spouting talking points, I make my own decisions. People on this sub are far to quick to assume someone gets all their info and believes everything they see on tv</p>

<p>The thing is while I believe challenging fringe or outlandish statements/opinions are fine and should be encouraged, the statement I made was neither, it really is just common knowledge for anyone that is slightly aware and as such I found the source demand unnecessary. That said, I handled it badly and really should of just taken the 5 min and done it and then voiced my objection of having to  do busy work :) Sorry for being a bit of a dick!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I am 100% sure some of the stuff is just cutting the fat from a bloated mess off a bureaucracy (and that is more than fine) but it&#39;s all the other shit on the side, the stuff I listed was just shit I could find quickly that I could back up  if I had to. I am fairly sure there is other stuff relating to oil drilling off your west coast and stuff around Alaska way etc. </p>

<p>I understand (please correct me if I am wrong, I am not American) that deregulation and slimming down of government powers is one of the Republican tenants? (let not get into defence spending and alphabet support) </p>

<p>So sure reduce waste, remove layers of bureaucracy and limit some of their powers, but there is <strong>no</strong> good side to shitting on the environment so your friends in an industry you are still intimately connected to can do whatever the fuck they like that without fear of being caught. Even if they do get caught now protections that were in place are now gone meaning nothing will be done about it apart from some bad press. </p>

<p>Even if you can ignore the rife rumours surrounding his time in the Senate (rumours don&#39;t always mean there is fire) and other shit that is more than rumours (it&#39;s 2am here and I&#39;m high, really cba sourcing) Put him in the cabinet in an Industry position. </p>

<p>Putting a man that has spent his career shilling for organisations that shit all over the environment in charge of an agency that is supposed to protect said environment really is a disgrace. </p>

<p>I am sure some deregulations have deeper reasoning behind them but they could never cancel out the damage this man could and is trying to do to your beautiful country all in the name of $$$</p>

<p>If you&#39;re a climate change denier then that sucks man, and you should look into it, it&#39;s not exactly disputed in scientific circles. Also the likely outcomes i.e. immense flooding/ecological damage and how this is likely to effect you personally.</p>

<p>he&#39;s in denial about trump because he&#39;s can&#39;t admit he got conned. in fact, he will probably never truly admit it, even though he knows deep down it&#39;s true.</p>

<p>some people just cannot admit when they were wrong. sad.</p>

I think a lot of them, like myself, have been through the heavy indoctrination of online conspiracy theories when they were younger/more naive and come out the other side. Now we kinda want to help other people break out of the cycle of believing everything that is contrary to popular opinion (&quot;crank magnetism&quot; it is sometimes called) but it is a very hard task as conspiracy theorists can be very stubborn, having attached their egos to the conspiracy mast, and don&#39;t want to get hurt by accepting they were wrong. Because its so hard sometimes we just fall back on taking the piss, which is also egotistical really.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I never said they were bad people. Just sick.</p>

<p>Have you ever met someone who commited suicide and though &quot;Yep, know they would&quot;.</p>

<p>I doubt it. The most broken people can look great on the outside.</p>

<p>No truely happy person has changed genders.</p>

<p>It takes a severe amount of pain to cross that threshold. </p>

<p>Transgenderism is a modern phenomenon. Any psychotherapists with a backbone will agree something is wrong.</p>

<p>A healthy individual doesn&#39;t make those kind of desicions.</p>

<p>I guarantee you can&#39;t find ONE transgender who hasn&#39;t been through depression or worse.</p>

<p>They are people who are upset that the world doesn&#39;t see them how they see themselves so they change theirselves to fit the worlds paradigm. That is extremely unhealthy.</p>

<p>How is gender dismorphia any different than the standard body dismorphia?</p>

<p>You dont have to agree with me. I know you have your mind made up. Im not posting this for you. I am posting this to let the unhealthy people know that there are healthier options to a happy and fulfilling live.</p>

<p>I believe encouraging them to change their gender instead of theirselves is dangerous.</p>

<p>Both of us have beliefs and both of us can be wrong. Only time and science will truly tell.</p>

<p>Im not &quot;transphobic&quot; because of hate or disgust. My view comes from love and sympathy. I know you can&#39;t see that right now but I dont dislike these people I want to help them. So do you, that&#39;s exactly why we can&#39;t agree.</p>

<p>We may agree on a million other topics but we can&#39;t let one disagreement stifle the conversation. Otherwise we will collapse with no accomplishments.</p>

<p>So if anyone reads this and would like help or atleast someone to talk to I am open to pms.</p>

<p>Transgender or not if you are facing difficult internal problems you HAVE to talk to someone. No one can do it alone and no one is ever truly alone. There are people willing to help each and every one of us. You just have to ask.</p>

No matter how much keft and right means nothing as the entire corporate run gov is one big corporate circlejerk, whilst the argument is still between religions, sexes, races, socioeconomic devides. The rich the 1% own most of the wealth, they set themselfs up to earn more in coming years. They set their wealth up to automate their empires and cast out the slaves, the debt enslaved, those who can never sit at their table. Their reach is global, it is after all their dream of globalisation. It is their banking systems, it is their corporate outreach that treats humans as consumers more than anything else. The conrtol the media, the militry the congress, the polical system if multiple nations not just US. They will fight tooth and nail ti retain their freedom from gov. The same gov they control, that control us all is not what they want. Thats why countries where gov controls the market and the rich under same umbrella of laws as the poor that they fear. For thos gov as corruot as they can get, still have one thing in common, a common sociatal law to encompass all. Thye think themselfs ebove us, they think they can, as they have been doing for decades influence all. </p>

<p>The people rose up and occupied wall st to shiw that we are not interested in their empire. They fought back ten fold. There is black lives matter, lgbq(and other pronounces), there is athiesm vs religion, there is the class devide, there is war on immigrants, there js a war with the others, the russians the chjneese etc. Its all a ploy to keep the emotional feeble minds of the masses occupies with primal insticts to band together against the &#39;others&#39;. Them against us, whay ever subsection of humanity you may orient yourself. </p>

<p>This isnt the war for sovereignety of the masses, it is the war of the masses against the privilage of the rich. They think themselfs ebove the kaw, they write the law. They think themselfs ebove reprimend, they throw their own under the bus so the greater whole can survive. </p>

<p>Humanity git away from religious oppression, from kingdoms and bloodline rule, to be juked back into class warefare, but the classes fight for semantics whilst the control and power is being ammassed by the true harbourngers of rule, those with the wealth and influence. </p>

<p>We gave democracy a try until democracy was a farse, we gave a cry a try until we realised we were just crying to each other. Whilst the slaves bicker between thenselfs, the rulers stride on to ensure their power goes uncontested. </p>

<p>Fight as we must, but untill the masses unite the vile greed of wealthiest few rules the lands. We are strongest when we stand together, but we fail to see beyond our little worlds, as per design of the system. For if we were truely taught critical thought and true history of the world gone past, we would know not to trust the comforting lies of the devil, and to question the gifts of gods. We would be our own gods. Alas, humanity got this far by working together, why do you believe that the devide is unavoidable. We got this far by working together, but not at the expence of the few. Now the few are the many, and the many can no longer stand by and watch their world being taken away by the few. Or so I hope.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s a divide and conquer tactic, derivative of a hegelian dialectic, used to distract and ultimately control the masses.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>False left–right paradigm political theory</p>

<p>The &quot;false left–right paradigm&quot; is the political theory that members of opposing political parties such as Republican and Democrat deceptively share common interests and goals, as a one body ruling authority over the masses. The two parties act to create divisiveness and influence the general population while keeping control of the political spectrum. The false left–right paradigm political theory is closely related to theory of Inverted totalitarianism and Managed Democracy.</p>

<p>The false left–right paradigm theorizes that opposing political groups use their influence over the establishment media to dramatize party warfare distraction, in grand performances of bureaucratic rivalry meant to propagandize and divide the populace. Psychological deception is coordinated on all levels of politics and fed through controlled media outlets to divert attention away from the ruling class&#39;s hidden agendas. By drawing attention to differences between two political systems, ideologies, races, and classes, the political groups obscure and divide unity among the masses. The tactic creates confusion and frustration among the population, enabling the global elite to increase and consolidate their wealth and power through maintaining an illusion of a two-party system of checks and balances.</p>

<p>Former Council on Foreign Relations (CFR) archivist and Georgetown University professor Carroll Quigley, who is known as being President Bill Clinton’s mentor, wrote in his 1966 book &quot;Tragedy and Hope&quot;—</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;The argument that the two parties should represent opposed ideals and policies, one, perhaps, of the Right and the other of the Left, is a foolish idea acceptable only to the doctrinaire and academic thinkers.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Instead, the two parties should be almost identical, so the American people can &#39;throw the rascals out&#39; at any election without leading to any profound or extreme shifts in policy.&quot; </p>

<p>Also, it&#39;s important to note, considering how Trump has been portrayed by the media as racist (especially by liberals), and as a sexist pig, WE will be looked at as racist and sexist for being associated with Trump. Jones doesn&#39;t ever seem to address this for some reason, and it is a huge concern of mine. The CTR campaign is updated and filled in on the agenda, I&#39;m seeing them prop up this narrative and labeling us as a Trump bee hive all the time.</p>

<p>This whole comment is spot on, but this part is the most interesting. If you try to have a discussion with someone who only gets their information from MSM, regardless of left or right, you&#39;ll quickly realize how uninformed they are on almost any topic. It&#39;s crazy how strongly people will defend their ideas, even if they don&#39;t really know what they are talking about. And then when you expose that they have no knowledge on the topic, they fall back on the idea of being able to look up the info that proves their convictions are true.</p>

<p>Shit is wild to see in action.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There&#39;s a lot of posts on <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> that are blatantly antisemitic. Even if it&#39;s just 1% of the community (though I think it&#39;s much larger), it&#39;s a vocal enough group to make it easy to paint the rest of the group as the same or at least sympathetic.</p>

<p>The community also doesn&#39;t do a good job of having a very nuanced understanding of the political spectrum. It&#39;s either Trump Support or Liberal Shill, where I guess there is actually quite a diversity of political opinion.</p>

<p>Speaking of diversity, there is no conspiracy community. There are simple places where people gather to talk about conspiracies. What conspiracy is is so diverse, with so many different opinions, that there is clearly no monolithic entity. </p>
