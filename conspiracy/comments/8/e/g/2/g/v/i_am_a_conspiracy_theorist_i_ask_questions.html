        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I ask questions.</p>

<p>I find some answers, but I always find more questions with them.</p>

<p>The answers I find and the questions I ask lead me to have beliefs about the world. I don&#39;t claim these beliefs as facts, they are just my best guess as to why things are the way they are and how things work. I change my guesses as I ask new questions and find more answers. I have no attachment to my current beliefs.</p>

<p>Asking questions about the nature of governments and institutions is what conspiracy theorists do. Why do states spend so much money on war? Why does the government want so much information about all of us? Whose hands are really on the levers of power if it is not the common people? Can we trust our governments and institutions to tell us the truth and do what is in our best interests?</p>

<p>I am a conspiracy theorist because I ask these questions, and I ask the questions the answers inspire. I don&#39;t have all the answers, and I don&#39;t even have all the questions, yet I still search for them.</p>

<p>If you are not a conspiracy theorist, do you not ask these questions?</p>

<p>Hence the post. All a conspiracy theorist is is one who asks these questions but for one reason or another rejects the official answers. </p>

<p>I feel perfectly justified in rejecting these official answers, or at least rejecting the argument that the answers are true based on the <em>authority</em> of governments and institutions, precisely because these very governments have a well-documented history of carrying out conspiracies and misleading the public. </p>

<p>Do you believe our government has ever been corrupt? (Assuming your in the US. If not, you can either answer about the US or your own government.)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The problem with &quot;skeptics&quot; as an identity is that all of us are skeptics, about some things. Christians are skeptical of arguments for atheism, and atheists are skeptical of arguments for Christianity. Conspiracy theorists are skeptical of governments and institutions, and coincidence theorists are skeptical of conspiracy theories. But &quot;good&quot; conspiracy theorists are also skeptical of conspiracy theories. </p>

<p>There&#39;s this concept that&#39;s developed over the last 20 years of Skeptics™, whose idols include people such as James Randi and Michael Shermer. They&#39;re skeptical of a great many things, many of which we should all rightly be skeptical of, yet they have their own ideological blind spots, which they do not typically question. The institution of Science™ is considered <em>mostly</em> trustworthy, and is usually off-limits. The idea of Good Government™ is similarly regarded as mostly trustworthy, and the skepticism is usually limited to questioning Republicans (or the right wing more broadly), and often for things which do warrant skepticism. </p>

<p>We do need to be consistently skeptical of all ideas and beliefs, but we should not fall into the trap of identifying as Skeptics with a capital S. That is an ideology which, despite the name, is not skeptical of its own axioms and foundational beliefs. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Why would anybody want to identify as a &#39;conspiracy theorist&#39;?</p>

<p>The masses have been programmed to equate &#39;conspiracy theory&#39; with <em>incorrect</em>, <em>unsuccessful</em>, and <em>crazy</em>.</p>

<p>If you pay attention for long enough, and put aside your ego, eventually you realise that there is no &#39;waking up&#39; the masses.</p>

<p>They are completely and utterly hopeless. Sheep in human form.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>&#39;Ego&#39; may mean something different to you and I.</p>

<p>When I talk about &#39;ego&#39; I am talking about the sense or feeling that one is an intelligent creature who can see what is in front of him.</p>

<p>The more I have learned about the hoaxes, the more I have had to accept my own innate stupidity.</p>

<p>This has led me to challenge more and more of my own fundamental beliefs, and with each step, the ego takes another hit.</p>

<p>I suspect that you are conflating &#39;ego&#39; with <em>confidence</em>, but these are very different things indeed.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Just anticipated the use of the more common definition of ego. The commonplace definition for ego is one&#39;s sense of self importance or self esteem; my mistake in reading it as the wrong definition. </p>

<p>I get what you&#39;re saying. The more you learn, the more you realize how wrong your previous views were, granting you the understanding that you very well may continue to be wrong moving forward. </p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>“Privilege implies exclusion from privilege, just as advantage implies disadvantage,&quot; Celine went on. &quot;In the same mathematically reciprocal way, profit implies loss. If you and I exchange equal goods, that is trade: neither of us profits and neither of us loses. But if we exchange unequal goods, one of us profits and the other loses. Mathematically. Certainly. </p>

<p>Now, such mathematically unequal exchanges will always occur because some traders will be shrewder than others. But in total freedom—in anarchy—such unequal exchanges will be sporadic and irregular. A phenomenon of unpredictable periodicity, mathematically speaking. </p>

<p>Now look about you, professor—raise your nose from your great books and survey the actual world as it is—and you will not observe such unpredictable functions. You will observe, instead, a mathematically smooth function, a steady profit accruing to one group and an equally steady loss accumulating for all others. Why is this, professor? Because the system is not free or random, any mathematician would tell you a priori. </p>

<p>Well, then, where is the determining function, the factor that controls the other variables? You have named it yourself, or Mr. Adler has: the Great Tradition. Privilege, I prefer to call it. When A meets B in the marketplace, they do not bargain as equals. A bargains from a position of privilege; hence, he always profits and B always loses. </p>

<p>There is no more Free Market here than there is on the other side of the Iron Curtain. The privileges, or Private Laws—the rules of the game, as promulgated by the Politburo and the General Congress of the Communist Party on that side and by the U.S. government and the Federal Reserve Board on this side—are slightly different; that&#39;s all. And it is this that is threatened by anarchists, and by the repressed anarchist in each of us,&quot; he concluded, strongly emphasizing the last clause, staring at Drake, not at the professor.</p>

<p>The problem with me being a conspiracy theorist is that other people who call themselves conspiracy theorists treat it as a hobby?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I take medication.   I experience some side effects. Sometimes I see myself on the planet &quot;Ogo&quot;, and part of an intellectual elite, preparing to subjugate the barbarian hordes on the planet Pluto. Even though this is a totally convincing reality for me in every way, nevertheless Ogo is actually a construct of my psyche. I am mentally divergent, in that I am escaping certain unnamed realities that plague my life here. When I stop going there, I will be well. Are you also divergent, friend?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Why would anybody want to identify as a &#39;conspiracy theorist&#39;?</p>

<p>The masses have been programmed to equate &#39;conspiracy theory&#39; with <em>incorrect</em>, <em>unsuccessful</em>, and <em>crazy</em>.</p>

<p>If you pay attention for long enough, and put aside your ego, eventually you realise that there is no &#39;waking up&#39; the masses.</p>

<p>They are completely and utterly hopeless. Sheep in human form.</p>

<p>This is the reality, &#39;conspiracy theorist&#39; or otherwise.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Shaming has become acceptable behavior in our society and it is disturbing. Since when is it ok to go around and persecute anyone <em>you</em> feel is deserving of <em>your</em> ridicule? Just because they may have a different opinion or it does not fall into <em>your</em> sense of what is acceptable does not give you the right to place judgement on my thought process. This sense of judgmental arrogance is destroying society.  </p>
