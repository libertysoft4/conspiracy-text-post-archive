<p>What the DNC and Hillary did was disgraceful, and downright dangerous. After someone leaked to wikileaks the internal workings of the DNC and the REAL collusion going on between it and the Hillary campaign, they opted to misdirect public attention by playing the victim, saying they were &quot;hacked&quot; and blaming Russia, still a major nuclear power, and needlessly damaging our relations with them as a result. </p>

<p>Of course, the whole &quot;hacking&quot; story was complete bullshit. So they and their friends in the media changed tacked and called it &quot;collusion&quot;. </p>

<p>It is imperative that this sub&#39;s users, who before the current trend of regurgitating talking points from <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a> and <a href="/r/worldnews">/r/worldnews</a> used to speak the truth about this issue. Do not let them misdirect you here too.</p>

<p>Yeah that happened in July. But Russia took them in April.</p>

<p>Yet the emails go through May.  </p>

<p>The argument that VIPS makes about the download speed has been debated, but no one has questioned the date and time of that extraction which was the evening of July 5.  Not only that, to assume you know which emails were discussed a month prior is also grasping at straws imo.  </p>

I essentially told them: &quot;I bet the Russian knew about the 600k emails on Anthony Weiner&#39;s computer and hired that 13 year girl old to entrap him... Causing the police to find the emails and forcing Comey&#39;s hand to re-open the investigation a week before the election.&quot;  Was kind of hoping to see it pop up in r/politics...

    <div class="md"><p>I looked into this more today.  Apparently Forensicator claimed the download speeds were consistent with copying to a USB and that the speeds would be extremely difficult to achieve using a remote connection and a VPN (which would be typical for a hack).</p>

<p>It&#39;s worth talking about.  This could happen to anybody.  The FBI could come visit you today and make you feel like it&#39;s somehow illegal to drink your favorite drink and then before you know it they&#39;ve scared you into claiming you dont&#39; like to drink coke and then they arrest you because they have proof you just drank a coke.  </p>

<p>Meanwhile, Hillary and friends deleted all those emails after subpoena and lied to the same fbi personeel without being arrested or charged with anything.  And that&#39;s an awfully awkward fact when people like you try to play up the papadop thing.  </p>

<p>Why wasn&#39;t Huma arrested?  Pretty sure she denied knowledge of the server or sending/receiving/storing classified information.  Surely she&#39;s going to be arrested if they&#39;re arresting people affiliated with Trump.  Or is it just republicans who can get arrested for lying to the FBI?  </p>

<p>You’re mistaking the DNC emails with Guccifer’s (Marcel Lehel Lazar) hack of Hillary Clinton and Sidney Blumenthal <em>which was open and public information.</em>  </p>

<p>published- April 08, 2016  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>In early 2013, news outlets including Russia Today and The Smoking Gun published memos from Guccifer, with excerpts of exchanges between Blumenthal and Hillary Clinton about Libya including details following the 2012 Benghazi terrorist attack.... Lazar also claimed to have stashed “unpublished hacked material in the cloud, some of it relating to the Middle East. …who was able to intrude (by reading biographies and guessing passwords) on sensitive emails about activities in Benghazi.” <a href="http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2016/04/08/source-no-coincidence-romanian-hacker-guccifer-extradited-amid-clinton-probe.html">source</a>    </p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>But nothing.  </p>

<hr/>

<blockquote>
<p>By the time Downer and Papadopoulos surveyed the menu of the Kensington Wine Rooms, <em>media reports were already rife with stories about a Romanian hacker code-named &#39;Guccifer&#39; who had absconded with Clinton-related emails by hacking her longtime confidant Sidney Blumenthal on Russia&#39;s behalf.</em>  </p>

<p>But the FBI, according to court documents, never spoke with Papadopoulos until January 15, 2017 – well after the election and just days before Trump&#39;s inauguration. By then, the FBI had co-authored a joint report with the Department of Homeland Security blaming malicious Russian actors for a series of cyber hacks related to the election. <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-5229417/Australian-ambassador-told-FBI-George-Papadopoulos.html">source</a>  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>No mention of Popadopoulos? Weird!  </p>

<hr/>

<p>It&#39;s also weird the FBI waited six months to talk to him!  </p>

<p>Papadopoulos was so important that:  </p>

<p>• July 15th 2016 Comey opens counterintel investigation into Russian collusion.  </p>

<p>• January 15th 2017 FBI visits Papadopoulos for first time.  </p>

<hr/>

<p>If a Papadopolous conversation in May 2016 was the origin, the source material, of the FBI counterintelligence operation, then why were they denied a FISA application in June/July 2016?   </p>

<p>Weird!   </p>

<hr/>

<p>Did officials seek a surveillance warrant on Papadopoulos? They reportedly got one on Carter Page in summer 2016. Did they try to get one on Papadopoulos? If not, why not?  </p>

<hr/>

<p>Here’s a very long rundown that highlights the pressure the FBI and Muller are under as the dossier tale crumbles. </p>

<p><a href="http://theduran.com/nyt-russiagate-story-george-papadopoulos-unbelievable/"><em>The NYT’s Russiagate story on George Papadopoulos is not believable. Here’s why</em></a>    </p>

<blockquote>
<p>This words “political dirt on Hillary Clinton” are almost certainly copied from the Australian High Commissioner’s report to his government, which was subsequently passed on to the FBI, and which forms the basis of the story in the New York Times.  </p>

<p>What these words show is that Papadopoulos was boasting in the London bar that the Russians had “political dirt about Hillary Clinton”, not that they had the DNC or Podesta emails.  </p>

<p>The words “the Russians had emails of Clinton” make it clear that the emails supposedly discussed by Professor Mifsud and Papadopoulos in the London hotel in April 2016 were not the DNC and Podesta emails but Hillary Clinton’s own 33,000 emails deleted from her private email server.  Had Papadopoulos referred to the DNC and Podesta emails in his interview with the FBI the indictment would surely have said so.  </p>

<p>The original indictment. Instead of using conjecture as to what Papadopoulos knew and didn’t know try citing what the facts are. You apparently make assumptions about him because you have no case without it? &quot;Pap knew! Pap knew!&quot; only serves to make your already weak case weaker.  </p>

<p>Oh really? This seems like a very good point. </p>

<p><em>the nature of Papadopoulos’s Russian contacts provides no evidence of collusion illegal or otherwise between the Russians, Papadopoulos or anyone else in the Trump campaign.</em>  </p>

<p>Your hoping and praying a process crime leads to something more fruitful. Your on a goose chase. Read on. </p>

<hr/>

<blockquote>
<p>Nunes noted that no intelligence was shared with the U.S. from any of the members of the “Five Eyes” agreement – that being Canada, the UK, Australia, New Zealand and the USA.  </p>

<p>This is relevant because the FBI says that the Trump investigation was kicked off after Australian diplomat Alexander Downer told the FBI that Trump campaign associate George Papadopoulos drunkenly admitted in a London pub that the Russians had “dirt” on Hillary Clinton. The New York Times reported last December that “Australian officials passed the information about Mr. Papadopoulos to their American counterparts, according to four current and former American and foreign officials with direct knowledge of the Australians’ role.”  </p>

<p><strong>This was clearly not true according to the EC, which states that no intelligence passed through Five Eyes official channels.</strong>  </p>

<p>...Nunes then told Fox’s Maria Bartiromo that the House Intel Committee is now honing in on the State Department due to signs of <strong>“major irregularities” in how the alleged Papadopoulos comments reached U.S. intelligence agencies.</strong>  <a href="https://bestchartnow.com/2018/04/22/no-official-intel-used-to-launch-russia-probe-according-to-controversial-doj-document-nunes/">source</a>  </p>

<hr/>

<p>Of course the NYT didn’t feel the need to write about this. </p>

<p>Alexander Downer is Bill Clinton&#39;s <a href="https://i.imgur.com/UUiVO81.jpg">longtime personal friend</a>. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>...Downer himself may see himself in shiny silver handcuffs when this investigation is over, with it seems more likely that he was a Clinton plant rather than a “concerned” Australian who just so happened to tip off the FBI, that began this entire witch hunt against the President of the United States of America. <a href="https://thegoldwater.com/news/24050-FBI-Tipster-Who-Began-Entire-Trump-Russia-Witch-Hunt-Is-A-Clinton-Foundation-Associate">source</a>  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Providing curated leaks to advance an agenda is rarely in the public’s best interest.  It’s for personal gain.   Usually it is done to hide your own corruption and/or crime.  The theory is that Russia had dirt on both Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton and chose to use the dirt on Trump to advance their agenda and use the dirt on Clinton to get Trump elected.  That’s not transparency.  It’s a lie of omission.   </p>

<p>Another example: whenever there is a controversial shooting of an unarmed person, the police department will “leak” an arrest record or a mug shot to the media of the slain person (even if it’s unrelated) to distract from the officer’s shooting.  It’s a leak meant to divert public attention to a potentially greater crime.   </p>

You&#39;d have to be very careless to leave traces of anything connecting the Russian government to a US presidential campaign. Sounds reassuring, but the fact that people within Trumps administration are actively trying to hide their relations to Russians and multiple people have been indicted and are now cooperating with the investigation should signal that there&#39;s a lot missing from the whole picture. Why do we have to create conspiracy theories of conspiracies. Regardless if people think the left is pushing the investigation to the absolute limits, this &quot;collusion&quot; investigation does have some credibility and has brought to light some of the illegal things people within Trumps campaign have been doing. And to those who say that it&#39;s stupid, over the top, or useless, I ask them to look at the Benghazi investigations. We shouldn&#39;t pick our fights based on our political opinions. </p>

<p>Totally, and fuck the DNC.</p>

<p>But there is a difference between a private political party pushing out a candidate vs. colluding/Whatever with a foreign power.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So maybe I really am just a dumb racist fuck or something, but if I look at situations (a) and (b) like so:</p>

<p>(a) Party colludes with media, rigs primaries to place elite-chosen candidate, most people are blind to this because of collusion with media and academic sectors.  Same party is also responsible for certain domestic atrocities in the past like the Waco massacre and (more distantly) slavery.  Same party is also seeking to severely restrict civilian firearms ownership, seen by many to be the last bastion against totalitarianism.</p>

<p>(b) Corrupt outsider rigs election by pirating information from social media and colluding with multiple foreign governments to influence domestic discourse and opinion.  Said outsider is a blatant womanizer with probable alt-right sympathies.  Has run for years in the wildly corrupt NY/NJ casino and hotel real estate market, has many disgusting associates from previous work in life.  Likely financially irresponsible, or at least a playboy with other people&#39;s money.  Utterly antagonistic to both major political parties as well as the media, can&#39;t do anything without a magnifying glass on him.</p>

<p>Maybe I&#39;m not seeing things right, but we&#39;re talking two totally different scales of corruption.  I know which one I&#39;d pick, even if you were completely correct about all the colluding with a foreign power.</p>

<p><strong>Question: Let us assume you are correct about collusion.  What exactly about this collusion is cause for concern?  What are you afraid of?</strong></p>

<p>Is this a true statement? I think voters&#39; (rightful) disillusionment with the DNC/Hillary contributed to her defeat. </p>

<blockquote>

<p>Uhh... You realize that Democratic party is not the same one as today? This is a very passe talking point. There was a major re-alignment in the 1960s-1970s where southern democrats joined the Nixon/Reagan coalitions. </p>

<p>Kinda seems like you just brought in some random anti Dem stuff. Waco, slavery (LOL) and gun control...Not sure how all of this is relates to the election. Therefore, I am questioning your bias in this conversation. </p>

<p>Situation B: I really think you are downplaying this situation. Please peruse the links that I&#39;ve posted in this thread, if you have time. </p>

<blockquote>

<p>That our democratic process was subverted (same concern as the DNC bs). That our President is able to be blackmailed by a foreign power. That the president, some of his campaign staff and administration staff are working to disrupt and divide civil society in the United States on behalf of Russia (directly or indirectly). Russia is not out here fighting for US interests, they are fighting for Russian interests. They want sanctions lifted, they want to move their dark money wherever they please. I worry that this collusion is the result of years of money laundering on behalf of Russian oligarchs. I could go on..really..</p>

<p>We saw that the Russia propaganda was aimed to push both sides of the political spectrum to the extremes. </p>

<p>I&#39;ve seen most of the material already.  It discusses only hypotheticals.  Where it becomes specific (i.e. Syria) I frankly don&#39;t agree, as I think it is in America&#39;s best interests to simply not be involved and if that means Russia operates Syria as a proxy state, sure, go for it.</p>

<p>Specifics.  What is the danger if Trump is compromised by Putin?</p>

<p>Russia intends to keep America divided, therefore if Trump is compromised, he will not take the necessary steps to unite us, or to prevent/fight off divisive forces. </p>

<p>I agree in the case of Syria, we need to gtfo. But I don&#39;t want the US to GTFO because its good for Putin, I want it because its good for us.</p>

<p>If his first thought in responding to any situation is &quot;How is Russia going to see this?&quot; and not &quot;Will this help Americans?&quot; then we have a problem. I am not saying these are the idiots&#39; actual thoughts..</p>

<p>Russia wants power. Putin adheres to the realist IR perspective in which power is zero sum. If the US has power, he doesn&#39;t.</p>

<p>Russia has also been following Dugin&#39;s Geopolitical playbook as well. </p>

<p>I confess I was not expecting this.  Most people I&#39;ve talked to about this issue have a hardline approach regarding Syria: leaving is tantamount to sedition and is direct evidence of Trump&#39;s beholdence to Putin.</p>

<p>So where do you draw the line?  How many things in the world are good for both Russia <em>and</em> America?</p>

<p>Is it possible for someone to actively work for the best interests of multiple parties?</p>

<p>If Trump works against America in a way that benefits Russia, that would be a problem (depending on the scope of the issue).  But I also think there is a great deal of oversight applied to Trump, perhaps more than any other president in history, so the risk is somewhat mitigated.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If the US has power, he doesn&#39;t.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Russia may adhere to this, but I don&#39;t, and I don&#39;t think it is a reasonable approach.  It is perfectly possible for multiple parties to enhance power without decrementing the power of others.  This is the case in the smallest of partnerships (such as marriage) or the greatest (such as international relations).</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Russia intends to keep America divided, therefore if Trump is compromised, he will not take the necessary steps to unite us, or to prevent/fight off divisive forces.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I am personally of the opinion that Fox and CNN are far, far greater threats to American unity than anything Russia has ever come up with.  But then again, I am maybe a little too open minded, I actually read RT sometimes and Al Jazeera and BBC and figure what the lines of propaganda are.</p>

<p>Not at all, I&#39;d repeat the decision in a heartbeat.  </p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>I honestly haven&#39;t read it.  There is only so much fascist nationalism I can stomach.</p>

<p>That said, it seems to me that there is a concerning amount of parallel between what Dugin prescribed for America and what we actually see.  If you wanted to suggest that the entire American media apparatus is someone in pay of (or corrupted by) Russian fascists, I might be inclined to consider your argument somewhat seriously.</p>

<p>That said, some of Dugin&#39;s prescription I am sympathetic to.  For example, I support (generally) the adoption of a more isolationist stance.  We have a lot of problems in our own country and we need to focus our resources internally towards solving those problems before we can be world policeman.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know how much of Dugin&#39;s writing is simply objective analysis (i.e. Club of Rome / Limits to Growth) versus actual prescription for action.  Either way, it honestly doesn&#39;t bother me much.  Should it bother me more?</p>

<li>Prescribes that Finland be absorbed by Russia.</li>
</ol>

<p>Russia has been performing military drills close to the Finnish border as well as hacking gov&#39;t websites. </p>

<ol>
<li>Prescribes Georgia should be dismantled. </li>
</ol>

<p>Obviously, we remember Russian invading Georgia years ago.</p>

<ol>
<li>Prescribes creating Geopolitical Shocks within Turkey.</li>
</ol>

<p>Failed coup? arming Kurds? Just speculation here. </p>

<ol>
<li>Prescribes that GB be cut off from Europe.</li>
</ol>

<p>Brexit? Cambridge Analytica (whom worked for Brexit camp) has ties to Russian professor.</p>

<ol>
<li>Prescribes creating racial divisions in the United States.</li>
</ol>

<p>Like planning fake BLM or anti BLM events..etc.</p>

<p>Food for thought anyway. A lot of the prescriptions seem to be playing out...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m only discussing the last two points because those are the only ones that concern us in America.  I&#39;ll grant you that many of Dugin&#39;s other statements are paralleled closely in reality, but the field of geopolitics (similarly to the field of Austrian economics) is rather like that.  Once you have a good model for how the world works, you can describe (to an extent) the most likely patterns in the near future.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Brexit? Cambridge Analytica (whom worked for Brexit camp) has ties to Russian professor.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is a bit of a stretch.  &quot;Ties&quot;?  What kind of ties?  Were they influential ties?  What about the professor?  The fact is, Cambridge Analytica hired a lot of very bright people and has a lot of ties all over the world, not to mention being funded by their various clients (again, all over the world).  Cambridge Analytica is sinister, but no more or less than any other efficient capitalist organization selling political influence for money.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Prescribes creating racial divisions in the United States.</p>

<p>Like planning fake BLM or anti BLM events..etc.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But you&#39;re totally missing the elephant in the room, <em>which is the fact that BLM exists as a radical, destabilizing organization in the first place!</em>  So unless you want to suggest that BLM itself is a Russian op, I feel like Russia&#39;s influence is marginal at best compared to the (explicit) destabilizing efforts of purely domestic political organizations.</p>

<p>There&#39;s no hacking charge possible if it was an internal leak.  Has anyone been able to show that the DNC leak was a hack?</p>

<p>It likely was more blackmail than collusion as trump is loaded with dirty laundered Russian money.

That obviously doesn&#39;t downplay the credibility gap either, but I tend to see a lot of people jump to the conclusion that this was some sort of anomaly in how the FBI and others handle things like this.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Jesus fuck. I don&#39;t live in Rhode island I said that only counting the legislative district delegates makes it look like my state is one tenth the size of Rhode island. Please stop and reread the previous sentence until it makes sense to you.</p>

<p>Next can we talk about the irony of you saying start with facts instead of making assumptions? Here we are 8 fucking comments down the chain and you still cannot grasp that you 3 million figure does not count all votes.</p>

<p>Carefully look at your own sources next time.  You just waste people fucking time.</p>

<p>Now back to the matter at hand.  You were going to link me to a source showing that &quot;all previous nominees had that level on control&quot; over the party.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hillary and team lost the election.  Since Day 1 there has been this massive resistance.  Remember that Hillary was expected to win and some of the brightest data scientist had her winning by a land slide.  Then she lost.</p>

<p>Instead of allowing people to grasp the upset or question how the media/DNC completely missed the boat or how the emails reveal rigging the DNC in Hillary&#39;s favor - the left, media and hollywood go 100&amp;#37; at Trump with the Russian Collusion.  Why? Credible evidence? Maybe or because it provides a huge distraction or both.  You can see approval ratings for Trump are good.  DNC hasn&#39;t adjusted their talking points or revised to resonate better with middle class.  There goal is to blindside everyone to eliminate all the little unknown details from the election.   The reason why things are heating up now - mid terms.   It isn&#39;t more information or indictments/impeaching of Trump.  Its to put a dark cloud over the opposition.</p>

<p>The question everyone should be asking - If Trump/Russia collusion is confirmed and charged - do you really think people (independents) will trust the DNC?  Hardly.</p>

<p>The US MSM, desperate to promote a narrative that will shore up corrupt/deeply unpopular institutions (the MSM itself, the CIA/FBI/NSA, the Democratic &amp; Republican establishments, Wall Street, etc.) then purposely conflate the two, making it seem like any evidence of Trump and co.&#39;s shady-ass financial dealings are evidence of &quot;collusion&quot;/&quot;election hacking.&quot; </p>

At this point, there&#39;s enough evidence to confidently say there was <em>some sort</em> of shady interactions between Trump and the Russians. Whether it was purely economic business, or election hacking, is beyond my ability to prove. Time will tell.       </p>

<p>I was just pointing out how people in the sub completely disregard the possibility of collusion as &quot;MSM lies and manipulation&quot; when there&#39;s a perfectly plausible scenario for it - almost like they&#39;re trying to defend him.... I never, and I repeat, <em>never</em> saw this gentle treatment being applied to figures such as Hillary, who are automatically assumed to be guilty of numerous crimes, in the sub.        </p>

<p>As a side note, even if there was no official collusion, shady business with the Russians is still definitely something to be worried about, and something that could sway Trump&#39;s opinion and treatment of Russia, as we&#39;ve seen happen numerous times now (remember the tariffs...?). It&#39;s still probably illegal and criminal, and it&#39;s a conspiracy theory that nobody on the sub seems to want to listen to.</p>

<p>2 separate issues entirely... nicely conflated to create a single  narrative.</p>

<p>Trump definitely has a case to answer, but that is of his own making.... it is NOT about Russian interference... though Trump may be giving them leverage a foreign nation should NEVER have over a sitting president... simply cause he was not up front about his business dealings</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If there is an investigation, and the investigators see evidence of another crime that has been committed, they aren&#39;t just going to say &quot;Oh hey, look, a crime, too bad this isn&#39;t what we are supposed to be investigating, better let it go&quot;...</p>

<p>No. They have to investigate it. This is why the Cohen investigation was transferred to SDNY... Mueller found evidence. The evidence wasn&#39;t related to the original investigation, but you can&#39;t just ignore it, so another group took it over.</p>

<p>And yes, evidence. No judge is going to grant a search warrant on a lawyer to the President without sufficient evidence of a crime and reason to think there is more evidence that could be destroyed if they simply ask/subpoena it.</p>

<p>Do we know what the evidence is? No. Likely, though, it has to do with either Trump&#39;s real estate dealings, which Cohen was heavily involved in, or it&#39;s Cohen&#39;s own businesses.</p>

<p><strong>June 22, 2016</strong></p>

<p>WikiLeaks releases private emails from DNC officials in the days leading up to the Democratic National Convention. Some emails show DNC staffers favoring Clinton over Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont.</p>

<p><strong>October 7, 2016</strong></p>

<p>In a joint statement, <strong>U.S. intelligence agencies express confidence the Russian government has attempted to interfere in the election</strong>: “The U.S. Intelligence Community (USIC) is confident that the Russian Government directed the recent compromises of e-mails from US persons and institutions, including from US political organizations.” <strong>That same day, Wikileaks begins publishing Clinton campaign aide John Podesta’s emails, which had been hacked in March 2016.</strong></p>

<p>** Published July 27th, 2016**</p>

<blockquote>
<p>AS THE DEMOCRATIC National Convention continues its week-long stay in Philadelphia, accusations of Russian hacking continue to cloud the proceedings. <strong>At this point, it seems likely that Russia is responsible. What’s less clear is what that will mean going forward.</strong></p>

<p>According to the reports, the Dutch government alerted the United States to Russian interference in the 2016 presidential elections after Netherlands-based officials watched the hacking of the Democratic National Committee (DNC) and other operations by the Russians, including a 2014 State Department hack.</p>

<p>So now that we have shown the story was not made up AFTER the election. Let&#39;s take a look at some of Trumps actions that draw into question his &quot;innocence&quot;.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Months before candidate Donald Trump asked Russia to “find” Hillary Clinton&#39;s missing private server emails — a statement the campaign later called a joke — a Russian operative told a campaign aide &quot;the Russians had emails of Clinton,&quot; according to a plea agreement released Monday. </p>

<p>But &quot;[o]n or about&quot; <strong>April 26, 2016</strong>, Papadopoulous again met with the Professor in a London hotel. The complaint reads that the Professor told him he had &quot;just returned from a trip to Moscow where he had met with high-level Russian government officials&quot; where he learned that the Russians &quot;have dirt&quot; on Hillary Clinton; &quot;the Russians had emails of Clinton&quot; -- &quot;they have thousands of emails.&quot;
<strong>This date is important because The Washington Post only first reported on June 14, 2016, that the hackers working for the Kremlin had penetrated the servers of the Democratic National Committee.</strong></p>

No it wouldn&#39;t look tempting at all, in fact id be more worried about being perceived as obstructing justice.

<blockquote>
<p>But the position of the FBI director reports to the attorney general. Also, the agency&#39;s intelligence activities are overseen by the Director of National Intelligence, according to the FBI. </p>

<p>While it&#39;s true that the attorney general is part of Trump&#39;s Cabinet, the president&#39;s remarks that the FBI director answers directly to him ignores a longstanding precedent of distance between the executive branch and an independent FBI. </p>

<p><strong>&quot;As a matter of constitutional hierarchy, this is of course true. But in investigative matters, the FBI director does not, or should not, serve the president by reporting to him,&quot;</strong> wrote Benjamin Wittes, editor in chief of Lawfare blog and a senior fellow in governance studies at the Brookings Institution.</p>

<p><strong>FBI directors serve a lengthy 10-year term designed to guard FBI directors&#39; political independence</strong> — and presidents typically do not want to give even the appearance of influencing the nonpolitical law enforcement agency&#39;s investigations.</p>

<p>The president can fire the director of the FBI, but only for cause. The executive branch isn&#39;t supposed to be directing the justice department on who they can, can&#39;t and should be investigating. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Would it not be tempting to try and end it before anything potentially embarrassing is leaked by people </p>
</blockquote>

<p>No, because ending the investigation could be obstruction of justice. Since I am innocent I would just let it play out. Also, Trump has already had so many things come out about him I really doubt anything can embarrass him at this point.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>ABC News&#39; George Stephanopoulos asked if Comey&#39;s assumption that Clinton would win the presidency in 2016 was a factor in his decision to send a letter to Congress in October claiming additional emails had been discovered related to the email investigation, days before the election. Comey said it, &quot;must have been.&quot; </p>

<p><strong>&quot;It must have been,&quot; Comey told Stephanopoulos. &quot;I don&#39;t remember consciously thinking about that, but it must have been. Because I was operating in a world where Hillary Clinton was going to beat Donald Trump. And so I&#39;m sure that it was a factor. Like I said, I don&#39;t remember spelling it out, but it had to have been, that she&#39;s going to be elected president and if I hide this from the American people, she&#39;ll be illegitimate the moment she&#39;s elected, the moment this comes out.&quot;</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>OP said the FBI is / was against Trump, I provided that announcement as a reference to refute the idea that the FBI is / was anti-Trump. I don&#39;t see how thinking the announcement won&#39;t impact the outcome means the FBI is anti-Trump.</p>

<p>I mean the original press release from the DHS says both they know of hacking, and they suspect other interference. <a href="https://www.dhs.gov/news/2016/10/07/joint-statement-department-homeland-security-and-office-director-national">https://www.dhs.gov/news/2016/10/07/joint-statement-department-homeland-security-and-office-director-national</a></p>

<p>Part of me thinks the hacking is not being talked about as much because it pales in comparison to what actually happened. Our president and his staff actively colluding with a foreign government to get elected is a much bigger story than that foreign government hacking.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m pretty sure the DNC were blaming the Russians well before ANY intelligence agency commented.</p>

<p>from an organisation stupid enough to use password as their password... and all the other idiotic stories we heard... I struggle to believe they were EVER ina position to cite the source of the leak/hack.</p>

<p>It is for that reason alone... from teh outset this has appeared to me as a distraction from the DNC problems that arose from the leaks.
the timeline clearly shows the Russia dialogue started around the day following the DNC chair allegations went public</p>

<p>they had the motive, they did not have IT ability to blame the Russians</p>

<p>so lets call it a 50/50 probability..... then teh IT contractors WELL overpaid and blackmailing a marine to return hard drives... the Feds NEVER actually getting the drives to inspect....  all the subsequent WTF moments have just served to re-enforce that this is a distraction</p>

<p>since the birth of the internet.... nefarious activities have happened out of Russia. Nothing has changed, other than an apparent ability to directly link all of those to Putin himself</p>

<p>and so far as voting machines... one must ASSUME everyone is trying to rig it, putting processes in place to guarantee a protected, legitimate and transparent voting process.   This should start with the so-called proprietry code... which should be fully public and audited imo.  Based on this alone.... America should clean it&#39;s own house before blaming external factors</p>

<p>I&#39;d be far happier if a total overhaul or audit of the voting system was initiated as a result, rather than simply blaming another country and doing the sanction thing, cause if it is not the Russians it will be the Chinese, or it will be or... or... or...</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Nunes noted that no intelligence was shared with the U.S. from any of the members of the “Five Eyes” agreement – that being Canada, the UK, Australia, New Zealand and the USA.  </p>

<p>This is relevant because the FBI says that the Trump investigation was kicked off after Australian diplomat Alexander Downer told the FBI that Trump campaign associate George Papadopoulos drunkenly admitted in a London pub that the Russians had “dirt” on Hillary Clinton. The New York Times reported last December that “Australian officials passed the information about Mr. Papadopoulos to their American counterparts, according to four current and former American and foreign officials with direct knowledge of the Australians’ role.”  </p>

<p><strong>This was clearly not true according to the EC, which states that no intelligence passed through Five Eyes official channels.</strong>  </p>

<p>...Nunes then told Fox’s Maria Bartiromo that the House Intel Committee is now honing in on the State Department due to signs of <strong>“major irregularities” in how the alleged Papadopoulos comments reached U.S. intelligence agencies.</strong>  <a href="https://bestchartnow.com/2018/04/22/no-official-intel-used-to-launch-russia-probe-according-to-controversial-doj-document-nunes/">source</a>  </p>
