Not to mention the daily bullshit he spouts.  Sean Hannity is  a terrible person, he&#39;s 2 faced and a piece of shit liar.  </p>

<p>Sean Hannity is a part of the media that tries to convince people, mostly the right wing, that it is poor people who take hand out from the govt that are our enemy.  That somehow the poor, with their govt dependance, are destroying our country.  Yet he. Gladly takes millions from the govt.  </p>

<p>With this revelation it is now more obvious than ever that the media in conjunction with the highest positions In our govt (in this case, the president ) is pushing a distract and divide agenda.  This is proof that can convict anyone.  And the reason they do this is because they are afraid of a unified populace. </p>

<p>I say, let&#39;s give them something to truly be afraid of.</p>

<p>I think Hannity decides for himself what he reports on, but that he actively decides to report propaganda that he knows for certain is untrue or a false representation of the facts.  </p>

<p>There are plenty others who do this, but I feel like a majority have simply fallen into the business side of media and blindly report whatever serves their beliefs or what they consider to be the ideal political ideology.  </p>

<p>Hannity is knowingly spreading propaganda because he&#39;s a piece of shit with no integrity. Others (based entirely on my flawed intuition) seem to just be ignorant or flat put stupid people with no integrity.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The only thing I was stating originally is that there seems to be a coordinated effort to smear Hannity right now (and for multiple reasons, not just one story being talked about everywhere). The fact that Hannity is coming under so much fire right now, makes me suspicious.</p>

<p>Would you be this defensive if the shoe was on the other foot?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>To be clear, I&#39;m not &quot;defending&quot; Hannity for anything. If anything, I&#39;m arguing that he&#39;s just as much of a shitty newscaster as anyone else on cable. It&#39;s the people here trying to defend newscasters they like as being &quot;legitimate news&quot; while Hannity is just 100% propaganda.</p>

<p>And yes, I had a lot of questions when Brian Williams go canned too. If reddit, and Apple news, and Twitter, and every cable news channel was pushing articles about what a piece of shit George Snuffalufagous is, I&#39;d ask the same question which is.... I wonder what they know...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I didn&#39;t mean to make it sound like Hannity was the only talking head who spews state sponsored propaganda. I agree that Cooper and Maddow are trash, and I actually disagree with their politics moreso than Hannity, but there&#39;s just something about the way the dude talks and the way that he conducts himself off the air that gives him a few extra slimeball points.  </p>

<p>I don&#39;t know how to articulate it exactly. It seems to me that he has more I dependent control over what he does, yet he actively chooses to spew bullshit because it serves him personally. For the others it seems part of a larger ideology, while Hannity just seems to enjoy that he&#39;s got so many people hanging onto his every word.  </p>

<p>Tl;dr: I&#39;d rather have lunch with Cooper or Maddow than get a quick coffee with Hannity, and I have no idea why. Just a skeevy feeling about him.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes. That’s what I said. I don’t see Amazon advocating for higher taxes while paying less. I also don’t think Amazon should pay more taxes than they are obliged to but I do think they should be obligated to pay more. </p>

<p>A better analogy would be all those that decried Ayn Rand for being vehemently against social security her whole life then drawing on it when she was eligible. According to them, she should have paid her entire life into a system she didn’t agree with then not take her money that was owed to her. Absolutely stupid. Had she been given choice I’m sure she would have gladly not paid in and not drawn a penny. Same with Hannity. If he is eligible to use the program, then that’s what it’s for and what we are all paying for, doesn’t mean he doesn’t have the right to think it shouldn’t exist. </p>

<p>And as others have said, you can still be against something while benefitting from it. That part of the conversation has absolutely zero merit, and only serves to try and damage his credibility for being a “hypocrite”. What would be hypocritical is if he benefitted it, and then talked about how great it was on his show.</p>

However, if we stopped subsidizing the USPS with billions of dollars every year, then this wouldn&#39;t even need to be an issue.

<blockquote>
<p>Fox News host Sean Hannity is linked to a group of shell companies that have <strong>spent $90 million buying</strong> hundreds of homes across the U.S through the help of foreclosures and the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD),</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So he is buying foreclosed houses through the HUD system which requires you to jump through a shit ton of hoops, inspections, and all to be done on a time limit. </p>

<p>Does nobody here understand what HUD does? Good for Hannity for putting his own money into urban housing.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>HUD doesn&#39;t make you do anything different than buying a home in a private sale. There are zero hoops to jump through and every contract has performance deadlines. And there are HUD foreclosures everywhere, not just urban areas. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t have a problem with him buying Foreclosures, although I bet there some sort of backdoor he has to them from his coziness with the current administration. If he doesn&#39;t, foreclosures aren&#39;t really that great of a deal right now. At least in my area and others I speak to about them. HUD knows most buyers see the word &quot;foreclosure&quot; and automatically assume it is a good deal so they price a little higher, or at market value, regardless of condition. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I’m convinced the Fox News surge was astroturfed by right wing propaganda designed to help Trump get his messaging across.</p>

<p>The generation that is too young to remember living through 9/11 and/or the aftermath of it don’t know how pathetic Fox became to shill for war and the Bush agenda. What followed was unprecedented open attacks on president Obama for 8 years. </p>

<p>Older generations had their biases confirmed by the network and the talking heads that shifted from giving you information from behind a desk to sitting on couches and sharing their own opinions.</p>

<p>This isn’t a critique on network media. Only Fox News. Save your whataboutism to try and deflect from the point I’m making. Fox News is the lowest of the low and is the first network to remarkably fail the bullshit test. It’s disheartening that a younger generation is buying into it just because they openly mock others and it’s branding itself as the only unbiased network.</p>
