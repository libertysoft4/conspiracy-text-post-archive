<p><em>If we need to mutilate a few baby penises to prevent another holocaust, then it’s worth it.</em></p>

<p>Over 80&amp;#37; of Danes are in favor of a ban on Jews being allowed to mutilate infant penises. That’s pretty overwhelming support.</p>

<p>You’d think that in a democracy, elected politicians would be tripping over themselves to approve such a popular measure. Well, you’d think wrong.</p>

<p>Because the true definition of democracy isn’t “a country ruled by the people.” Democracy simply means “a country ruled by Jews.”</p>

<p><a href="https://www.bt.dk/politik/soeren-pind-gaar-ind-i-betaendt-debat-og-sables-ned-userioest-og-skammeligt">BT</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>A citizen’s proposal, which has received over 42,000 supporters, is currently being debated. <strong>The proposal will introduce 18 years as a minimum age for circumcision which is not necessary for health reasons and is chaired by Lena Nyhus, chairman of the Intact Denmark association, working to protect everyone from what it calls ‘genital mutilation’.</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p><em>Jews BTFO. I hope to God this passes.</em></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Now, Søren Pind (V), Minister for Education and Research, started debating before the proposal is expected to achieve the 50,000 signatures that are required before the proposal is to be considered in parliament.  </p>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/sorenpind"><strong>Søren Pind✔</strong>@sorenpind</a>  </p>

<p>Jeg forstår, at et borgerforslag atter vil sende danske jøder til Sverige. En gang var alt rigeligt. Det bliver ikke med min stemme. <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/omsk%C3%A6ring?src=hash">#omskæring</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/femm%C3%B8rke%C3%A5r?src=hash">#femmørkeår</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/sorenpind/status/987340553179291648">10:41 AM - Apr 20, 2018</a><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/like?tweet_id=987340553179291648">140</a>  </p>

<p><strong>‘I understand that this citizen’s proposal will send Danish Jews to Sweden again. This happening once was enough. I won’t support this,” writes Søren Pind on Twitter.</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Who in his right mind could think that Jews leaving your country would somehow be a bad thing? Especially if they leave for Sweden. It’s not like that place can get any worse, so there’s really no victim here.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Lena Nyhus is also annoyed. She is the chairman of the association Intact Denmark, which works to protect children from “genital mutilation”, as the association calls it. <strong>“I think it’s crazy that he implicitly accuses 80 percent of people of being Nazis just because they are opposed to cutting into the genitals of healthy children,” she said, referring to multiple polls, at the latest, as measured by Megafon for TV 2 and Politiken in January. Here, 83 percent answered that they are backing a ban on circumcision of boys.</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yeah, this kind of thing is going to be extremely popular with liberal types. After all, it’s very hard to justify mutilating babies for religious purposes within the modern liberal paradigm. Add to that all the people who actually hate Jews and Moslems, and it’s hard to even imagine what kind of person would oppose this ban.</p>

<p><em>These people definitely didn’t read Foreskin Man, I can tell you that.</em></p>

<p>Of course, the Jews are arguing that this is unacceptable for predictable reasons.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.dr.dk/nyheder/indland/israels-ambassadoer-om-omskaeringsforbud-husk-nu-joedernes-historie">DR</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>A ban on circumcision would be an infringement of the Jew’s basic religious rights, says Benny Dagan, who is Israel’s ambassador to Denmark.</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Wow, I guess I should start a religion where doing bank robberies is a sacred rite. Perfect plan.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>According to the ambassador, there is a lot of scientific evidence that circumcision is the healthy for the boys. <strong>Therefore, he does not believe you can legislate against the ritual and draws parallels to the Holocaust.</strong> “It’s all about Jews’ right to practice their religion, especially when thinking about the Jewish history in Europe, which unfortunately is very tragic. <strong>Millions of Jews were killed and their communities wiped out, he says.</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>European laws have to conform to Jewish norms because of the Holocaust. Sure.</p>

<p>This Holocaust guilt tripping has been used so much over the past decades that people are sick to death of hearing about it. Nobody cares anymore.</p>

<p>So while it’s quite likely that this law project will be canned, the reason for it won’t be moral pressure by Jews, but pure corruption by the political class.</p>

<p>Oh well, we’ll see.</p>

<p>It&#39;s the first thing they go to whenever whites/Europeans organize to resist the jewish agenda for mass non-white immigration invasions into all European nations.</p>

<p>And you see it now with  people who oppose the war against Assad, and who believe the &quot;gas attack&quot; was a false flag.  The jewish-controlled Establishment media is attempting to &quot;discredit&quot; those people by calling them &quot;white supremacists&quot; or &quot;neo-Nazis&quot;. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Cutting of your foot will prevent Athlete Foot!</p>

<p>Routine surgery on newborn babies is not the best solution to any problem.</p>

<p>No, circumcision is not an effective prevention method for UTIs.</p>

<p>The first link in a Google search (Search term: circumcision UTI) shows:</p>

<p>Conclusions: Circumcision reduces the risk of UTI. Given a risk in normal boys of about 1%, the number-needed-to-treat to prevent one UTI is 111. In boys with recurrent UTI or high grade vesicoureteric reflux, the risk of UTI recurrence is 10% and 30% and the numbers-needed-to-treat are 11 and 4, respectively. Haemorrhage and infection are the commonest complications of circumcision, occurring at rate of about 2%. Assuming equal utility of benefits and harms, net clinical benefit is likely only in boys at high risk of UTI.</p>

<p>Complications from Circumcision are estimated between 2% and 10%, this study the lowest estimate of 2%.</p>

<p>this is it. and it is why jews are so smart and hardworking. they have been doing it the longest. it makes men not masturbate as much and when they have sex they orgasm quicker leaving the women unsatisfied, they thought back then men and women were too focused on sex and not working hard for the high priests.</p>
