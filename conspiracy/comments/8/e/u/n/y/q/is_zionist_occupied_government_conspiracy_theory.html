<p>Welcome to r/ZOG, and explore the concept.</p>

<p>It&#39;s been <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/search?q=r%2Fzog&amp;amp;restrict_sr=on">6 years since r/conspiracy had advertisement</a> for it. Here is a redux. But contrary to the previous ad, I&#39;m here to advise there IS a conspiracy. Instead of antisemitism <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/C_S_T/comments/65c72e/antisemitism_is_a_matrix_psyop_mind_control/">(being a psy-op lie)</a> we have anti-Zionism, which the sub tends to prove by users like me.</p>

<p>r/ZOG users have plenty of competition from Zionist trolls, so please have a look, and maybe join us to improve the odds against them?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, it absolutely is a thing and has been since at least JFK. Zionism is so rampant through US government that the US has been fighting wars in the Middle East that just coincidentally benefit <a href="http://www.informationclearinghouse.info/article33220.htm">Irsaels Yinon Plan.</a></p>

<p>US foreign policy has been <a href="http://www.finalcall.com/artman/publish/National_News_2/article_8446.shtml">hijacked by AIPAC</a> and Israel first neocons that make sure the narrative is always about the middle east and &quot;terrorism&quot;. AIPAC is the only foreign Agency that has somehow gotten out of the requirement to register as a foreign Agent within US government...they know once they have registered as foreign, they will lose most of their power to control US foreign policy.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Honestly we are gonna have to start telling the truth about what anti-semitism is. Do we really believe that it is a psy-op? Jews have been kicked out of 359 areas before, most times it was before the concept of Zionism even existed. Ulysses S. Grant even kicked Jews out of some parts of America because he said they violated every trade agreement and partook in war profiteering. Are we sure anti-semitism is unnatural and ONLY happens because it is pushed by TPTB? Are we going to lie to ourselves and say that Jews are not disproportionately involved with controlling the federal reserve and creating a system of debt slavery which ensures we will always have more debt than actual money in circulation? Not disproportionately involved in controlling the media that works 24/7 to feed us lies and shrieks when Israel is brought up. Not disproportionately involved in Hollywood/music/entertainment, the very industries that promote violence, degeneracy, sexual freedom, and other things that have brought down the cultural level and have transformed our traditional way of life. Even If Zionism fails, Jewish people will still have disproportional access to the corrupted banking and money lending system. The high technology systems that stalk and monitor us. The education and entertainment institutions that push Marxist onto the youth. There just HAS to be more to it than Zionism </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was thinking a similar thing about the word &quot;xenophobia&quot;. If it is a natural instinctual reaction to be skeptical of other races/tribes of people then is &quot;xenophobia&quot; a word that is used to shame white people into being &quot;inclusive&quot; or &quot;multicultural&quot;? I am starting to think that xenophobia is the NORM and that being NOT afraid/skeptical/non-inclusive other tribes/races is a dangerous/stupid mindset?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You are correct. We have evolutionary characteristics that make us very much prone to in group preference (marrying within your race, having more friends that are your race, and living in neighborhoods that are demographically similar to you). It is normal to have a preference for people who look like you, and you are more likely to get a long with people within your race. </p>

<p>You may also be interested to know that studies where people have experienced brain damage to a certain area of the brain makes them significantly less likely to be religious and more pro-open boarders (essentially they lose their ability to be skeptical of people from different tribes). Xenophobia and to a certain extent racism are essentially made up words used to shame white people for their self-preservation and prosperity. </p>

<p>Two of America&#39;s top political scholars document, in a paper published at Harvard, that the &quot;Israeli lobby&quot; has a &quot;stranglehold on Congress&quot; and &quot;vast influence over Republican and Democratic administrations&quot;, and that fanatical pro-Israel Jewish neo-conservatives were the &quot;driving force&quot; behind the Iraq War.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think the Zionist movement and the &quot;Jewish Overlords&quot; ideas should be disambiguated. To me, these are distinct phenomena.</p>

<p>On one hand, Zionism is just a special case of nationalism being fought by people on the fringes of Israeli society. On the other hand, there&#39;s the fact of Jewish financial and intellectual success. This seems to be an artifact of a culture which values education. Feeling like the Jews are taking over the world? Chances are you&#39;re not very educated. Them&#39;s just the facts. No insult meant. Jewish culture makes education a priority--as do many Asian cultures. But in America it&#39;s cool to be the stupid kid in the back of the class. </p>

<p>Those stupid kids grow up to be stupid adults who attribute their lower standard of living to a group of people who value intellectual ability over being cool. So this animosity <em>should</em> fall at the feet of their parents who either weren&#39;t around much or didn&#39;t give a fuck or both.</p>

<p>Now, for the conspiracy-curious, there are a few notable Israeli lobbying groups which make no bones about their agenda: keep the US dollars coming, look the other way at Israeli atrocities, and bend UN Security Council vetoes in favor of Israel at all costs. By appearances, this has the appearance of a ZOG--Zionist Occupational Government.</p>

<p>But if the influence of AIPAC is the source of this idea, then surely we are actually a PEMOG--Pharma Energy Military Occupational Government. These industries have vastly greater sway over policy in the US than any single country&#39;s lobbying efforts. Perhaps more than all other countries combined. The important part is that if influence is the yardstick, Israel isn&#39;t even making the top 10.</p>

<p>Which religious/cultural group do you think has earned more Nobel prizes than any other religious/cultural group in history? You guessed: Jews. Many of these Nobel Laureates consider themselves non-religious, but the point is that their culture values intelligence, and hence these people are more likely to succeed than the average person, especially in America. </p>

<p>So, if you feel the urge to be mad at the Jews, you should probably be mad at the educational system or the people who instilled your values, because it&#39;s not the fault of successful people that other people are not successful. Unless you&#39;re Betsy DeVos.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>An absolutely brilliant comment on the matter. The right wing conspiracy theorist cum in their pants when it comes to the “Jewish conspiracy”, in reality they’re less educated and that point is extremely prevalent about various cultures education. You hit the point on the nail with PEMOG gov and influence. All sound logical points that never get brought up when discussing this matter. It’s hilarious and dangerous how scapegoated Jews are in some conspiracy circles. Especially from a secular point of view, I don’t give a shit if someone’s Jewish or Hindu, if you’re a shitty person you’re a shitty person regardless. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I would broaden the notion to the entire group of identities rooted in the religion/ god of abraham and all 3 of it&#39;s main divergent forms. Not just a single tribe of isreal. I was raised in a christianish/ american luciferian religion that drew it&#39;s identity lineage through Ephriam and not Judah, but was the very definition of a society of zionists, lead by a council of 12 elders and a godhead council who brainwashed their followers into believing that they literally speak for god on earth. Fun fact, this organization hosted the olympics and almost put a puppet millionair in the white house the election before last. Central to their world view is establishing a New jerusalem in the New world and Restoring ancient Isreal in the old with intent that they would become the two joint capitols of the entire earth... Just saying. </p>

<p>... and this windy comment proves it. The-Jews-are-smart argument is the popular side-step to intentionally ignore the facts. This BS is soundly refuted in multiple instances on r/ZOG, clueless jay_howard.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You can claim it&#39;s bs, but that&#39;s just a claim with no substance behind it. You can also throw insults, but that doesn&#39;t build your case either.</p>

<p>Do you think Jewish culture <em>doesn&#39;t</em> value education? Or that the dumb kids in the back <em>don&#39;t</em> grow up to be dumb adults? (Where are all the WWE fans coming from?) </p>

<p>People have been peddling the &quot;Jewish Overlords&quot; nonsense for decades and all we have to show for it is the <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Protocols_of_the_Elders_of_Zion">provably bullshit Protocols of the Elders of Zion</a> which was fabricated from whole cloth. If Jews ruled the world, why hasn&#39;t a single POTUS been Jewish? Secret Jews?</p>

<p>When it comes to geopolitics and control of human populations, Judaism is not the over-arching thread, it&#39;s money and military might.</p>

<p>In America, if any religion is &quot;in charge,&quot; it&#39;s Christianity. Led by white men. With money. There&#39;s your culprit! </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I would broaden the notion to the entire group of identities rooted in the religion/ god of abraham and all 3 of it&#39;s main divergent forms. Not just a single tribe of isreal. I was raised in a christianish/ american luciferian religion that drew it&#39;s identity lineage through Ephriam and not Judah, but was the very definition of a society of zionists, lead by a council of 12 elders and a godhead council who brainwashed their followers into believing that they literally speak for god on earth. Fun fact, this organization hosted the olympics and almost put a puppet millionair in the white house the election before last. Central to their world view is establishing a New jerusalem in the New world and Restoring ancient Isreal in the old with intent that they would become the two joint capitols of the entire earth... Just saying. </p>
