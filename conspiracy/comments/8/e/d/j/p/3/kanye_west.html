<p>Before his &quot;breakdown&quot; in 2016, Kanye spoke onstage about the manipulation of media and how to break the programming... That night he was forcibly institutionalized, and after that, Kanye stopped speaking out-- leading some to suspect he was a victim of MK Ultra. </p>

<p>However, this week he&#39;s gotten back on Twitter and has been dropping truth bombs non stop. And it&#39;s amazing. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Another interesting, more controversial, recent tweet was &quot;I love the way Cadence Owens thinks&quot;. Owens is a black, female conservative with some fairly radical talking points. Some people interpret this as Kanye being conservative, but others (like myself) believe he&#39;s working to change the paradigm and break down the gap between the parties. </p>

<p>Here&#39;s a good video Scott Adams made recently about Kanye&#39;s controversial tweets, and their significance: <a href="https://youtu.be/UEHrndvoefw">https://youtu.be/UEHrndvoefw</a> </p>

<p>Kanye has since tweeted clips of the Scott Adams video, too. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Confirmation bias and tribalism. But his tweets about capitalism are very soft handed if they are to be viewed as a harsh criticism it would be more at the person than the system. I would read it out as material items can not replace true friendship and relationships. This is something I would imagine most trump supports would actually agree with him.</p>

<p>Is Kanye a straight down republic no is he a Trump support probably he has shown support in the past so this isn&#39;t too surprising. Kanye is probably a classical liberal based on his previous tweets and statements. </p>

I obviously don&#39;t know that they haven&#39;t been got, but I also don&#39;t take it for granted that they have, either. </p>

<p>I guess it comes down to me liking what they&#39;re currently saying, and I have a hard time thinking that&#39;s what TPTB would program them to say. Because of that I don&#39;t really want to believe otherwise lol. I guess I&#39;ll have to keep more of an open mind about them</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Lupe had made several statements about resisting the hierarchy structure and requirements to be a star in his interviews.  He went off like Kanye at one of his concerts.  Here is one of them <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QHQhChPuoLw">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QHQhChPuoLw</a></p>

<p>I remember he went radio silent some time later.  The guy was on his way up and then he just went away.  I don&#39;t follow musicians much but I knew from the beginning he was under the wrong label. Lupe was incredibly gifted - his lyrics were far more superior than most of the rappers today.  I just think people were not able to comprehend his depth and his label didn&#39;t know how to shape it much less market it.   I recall one song where he was telling a conspiracy in 3 ways and when you pieced them together it became 2 conspiracies.  Hard to explain but he was impressive. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>here is my working theory </p>

<p>the white hats in the lead up to the election programed him with Mk.ultra style brainwashing to be a hero.</p>

<p>trump wins.</p>

<p>few days later yeezy goes on 18 min rant midshow dropping redpills for the world. yeezy gets takin to hospital under some protective order against his will. some say he was handcuffed to stretcher during intake. some anon nurse reported electroshock therapy was used. to what extent we may never know. </p>

<p>then as soon as he&#39;s released he appears at trump tower for a meeting. </p>

<p>I think that&#39;s where he was debriefed and they reprogrammed him to lay low until it&#39;s safe for him to be activated once more for the white hats.</p>

<p>when reporters tried to get comment from Kanye standing next to trump all he could say &quot;I&#39;m just here to take pictures.&quot; that&#39;s all he knew becuase the programing was so deep he had to forget everything untill triggered for his own safety and to not compromise the grand scheme they had to make him forget.</p>

<p>and now Kanye is being triggered to activate once more </p>
