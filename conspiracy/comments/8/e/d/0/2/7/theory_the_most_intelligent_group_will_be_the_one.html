        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p><strong>Several premises.</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>That to be human is to have “human thought”: the ability to think in the form of words/language.</li>
<li> --That language and thought are so intertwined that it is not possible to be “fully human” and not to have both.</li>
<li>That the nature of the intelligent being is toward organization and order.</li>
<li> --That the farther apart elements drawn together for organization are---the more intelligence it demands.</li>
<li>That in competition, a unified and organized group of individuals will out-compete individuals who are not unified/organized.</li>
<li>That if humans are exposed to comfort, power, pleasure, the majority exposed will wish and work toward more of it.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Therefore:</strong></p>

<p>Individuals are in competition with each other.
Groups (religious, ethnic, cultural, political) are in competition with each other.
In conflict, the more powerful group will win.  Power is begotten in various ways.  In an election: votes/voters.  In religion, money/ferver via messaging, truths presented, and help given.  Ethnic, typically through numbers or violence. </p>

<p>Humans can out-compete most animals, due to our intelligence and use of thought/language.
The easiest way to win a war, is to convince the enemy not to go to war; likewise in winning a competition.  Is there any easier way?</p>

<p>What is the easiest way to convince, than by having the subject think that he is fully in charge of his thoughts? (rather than to have an intellectual or verbal battle?)</p>

<p>Language and thoughts are the same. Thoughts are language. Language is thought.</p>

<p>The internet is a new land.  It is a new kingdom.  A kingdom of the mind.  Of thoughts&amp;language.  If the people’s of this earth are <strong>not</strong> equal, and some peoples are smarter, then there exists a people that are “the smartest”.  If this group were able to control thoughts&amp;language, they can convince others not to compete against them.  If this people can control the roads in the new kingdom of the internet upon which thoughts&amp;language travel, they can control thoughts&amp;language of competition against them.  If they can control thoughts/language of individuals in another group’s government, they can influence that group’s policy/actions, which impacts competition. If people in that group object to the policy, then the intelligent proponents of this most intelligent group will make changes to what is “good” and what is “bad” thought/language in the opposing group.  </p>

<p>Internet/electronic age has shortened time.
Especially true regarding social norms, as electronic media changes much faster than paper media, and the “threads of intellectual consumption” are much shorter (think youtube vids, as opposed to 2-hour movies. Think short-sentence reddit headlines and replies, as opposed to multipage-single-author newspaper articles.)  Don’t lose me. Stay with all this.  Thoughts/language change much faster now.  History is less preserved. </p>

<p>Therefore changes that the smartest group want to make can be made more quickly now.</p>

<p><strong>To win in competition, it these things are in this group’s best interest:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>the group shall not be diluted. Any attempt to dilute is an attack on the group</li>
<li>other groups shall not be as smart</li>
<li>other groups shall not be organized/united</li>
<li><em>control of all other group’s language(thought!) to not-compete or even to aid the group is prized</em></li>
<li>other groups shall not recognize who is controlling group/(national)(world) discourse</li>
<li>individuals who are a part of the group shall contribute in some way, or be ostracized</li>
</ul>

<p>The fact is, Jews are succeeding with Israel in a way that any group of people would envy, should they wrap their head around it. It is an ethnocentric nation, but which grants dual-citizenship to its citizens which then work in governments of most of the first-world nations. The most powerful first-world nation pays to each Israeli citizen the equivalent of $4xx dollars per person, per year. This largest first-world nation also does it&#39;s bidding in warring against its neighboring nations, and turns a blind eye as it persecutes (and steals from) the people in the surrounding land. Israel can boast that it&#39;s people control nearly all the megaphones in all first-world nations (CNN/NBC/reddit, etc.)....therefore controlling most of the dialog. If you control a people&#39;s dialog for long enough....... (think for yourself. If someone has controlled your nation&#39;s or your family&#39;s dialog for your entire life... think of all the differing thoughts and decisions you might have had/made, if the dialog in your nation was not manipulated. Control the dialog, and you control thought. Control thought, and you control the nation. There need not be official laws infringing upon free speech if speech largely occurs through private controllable networks. One must simply control the private networks to control speech.... to control thought .....to control a nation.</p>

<p>In some ways, one could say that it is not Jews winning this, but the kernel of human essence: the tendency toward order (which goes against the universe [entropy]). Jews just happen to be at the forefront because of the various strains of humankind (created by differing environments) Ashkenazi Jews are the most intelligent.  They are therefore greater bearers of “being human”.  Because it is a strain of humanity, tied together via genes, it is in their best interest to remain cohesive as a group so as to out-compete all other strains and attain the most pleasure/comfort/power.</p>

<p><strong>Endnotes (brief).</strong>
Most of the above is simply reasoning.  If you doubt any of it, research the various ethnicities of this earth, and judge them by raw IQ scores.  (Or, if you do not like raw IQ, study the advancements each civilization has made, and study their rates of violence, STD’s, and current earning power.)  Study who owns/controls thought/language. Study who owns most of the wealth.  Study the spectrum of who does undesirable vs. undesirable work.  Study if there are groups, and which groups promote the most cohesiveness (this group will likely be in greater unity/organization, and therefore better positioned in competition.)</p>

<p>Lastly, a longer study of this theory, and a good read with <em>many</em> sources, is <a href="http://www.angelfire.com/rebellion2/goyim/je1.pdf">The Culture of Critique</a> by Macdonald.  I highly recommend reading even just the first 12 pages of the preface.  </p>

<p>I am saving this writing, and I will add any interesting comments to it.  I am especially interested in adding proposals for actions as to what (if anything) should be done to fight against such an intelligent and organized group.  I do believe that at a bare <em>minimum</em> other nations should not allow individuals from this group to actively use the host-nation’s government for outside benefit. Outside nations ought to pull themselves together, and control the media which they consume.</p>

<p>They didn&#39;t use gas. They didn&#39;t use biological weapons. They didn&#39;t use assassination of enemy politicians. They didn&#39;t push nuclear warfare. They had a lot of means to escalate the conflict beyond the conventional warfare. They could have easily burned down the major cities in France/Belgium or the Netherland and squeezed these countries to the bone during the occupation which they didn&#39;t.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ahhh, but to commit the greatest atrocities, one must use other people.  For then, no one is guilty.  A man taking orders does not take the blame, for he is taking orders under penalty of treason/prison.  The man giving the order does not see the faces of those killed, so he feels little remorse.  Thus, to kill the most people or to inflict the most cruelty, it must be done from affar, through a chain of command.  And for all to go along with it, it must be done &quot;in the name of good&quot;.  It is for everyone&#39;s good, that&#39;s why we&#39;re doing this.  Those men you are killing, they are <em>evil</em>.  They gassed their own citizens.  Or their ancestors enslaved people.  Or their ancestors sold slaves.  etc</p>

    <div class="md"><p>¨...That is the law of genetic drift, mentioned earlier as a crucial factor in the evolution of small populations. If a small population is inbreeding, the rate of drift of the average measure of any human capability scales with the inverse square root of the population. Big fluctuations of the average happen in isolated villages far more often than in cities. On the average, people in villages are not more capable than people in cities. But if ten million people are divided into a thousand genetically isolated villages, there is a good chance that one lucky village will have a population with outstandingly high average capability, and there is a good chance that an inbreeding population with high average capability produces an occasional bunch of geniuses in a short time. The effect of genetic isolation is even stronger if the population of the village is divided by barriers of rank or caste or religion. Social snobbery can be as effective as geography in keeping people from spreading their genes widely.</p>

<p>¨A substantial fraction of the population of Europe and the Middle East in the time between 1000 BC and 1800 AD lived in genetically isolated villages, so that genetic drift may have been the most important factor making intellectual revolutions possible. Places where intellectual revolutions happened include, among many others, Jerusalem around 800 BC (the invention of monotheistic religion), Athens around 500 BC (the invention of drama and philosophy and the beginnings of science), Venice around 1300 AD (the invention of modern commerce), Florence around 1600 (the invention of modern science), and Manchester around 1750 (the invention of modern industry).</p>

<p>¨These places were all villages, with populations of a few tens of thousands, divided into tribes and social classes with even smaller populations. In each case, a small starburst of geniuses emerged from a small inbred population within a few centuries, and changed our ways of thinking irreversibly. These eruptions have many historical causes. Cultural and political accidents may provide unusual opportunities for young geniuses to exploit. But the appearance of a starburst must be to some extent a consequence of genetic drift. The examples that I mentioned all belong to Western cultures. No doubt similar starbursts of genius occurred in other cultures, but I am ignorant of the details of their history.¨--Freeman Dyson</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So... being an &quot;arsehole&quot; (as you would say)/evil (as I would say) - what then is this &quot;end boss&quot; - good people? the source of Good?</p>

<p>The secret ending is what? Lucifer telling you you embraced his gift of intellect and shrugged off an evil god?</p>

<p>Have fun coming back here over and over again until you realize that&#39;s the wrong answer...</p>

<p>I think you make strong points with the language bit. We are inseparable from our language/thoughts, because this is one of the fundamental components of our consciousness.</p>

<p>However, I think the most immoral group will be the most successful; moral people have &quot;a code&quot; or ruleset that makes them linear, whereas immoral people do not have any such limitations.</p>
