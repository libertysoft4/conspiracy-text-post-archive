    <div class="md"><p>Agreed wholeheartedly. He was most effective (read: believed by viewers) during the doomsday-prophecy era; post-soviet union nukes, Y2K, 12/12/12 etc. It seems those end of the world stories are dying off, and LARPs are filling the void. The 2016 election seems to be his last hoorah, offering eager distraction from all manner of more important stories emerging from both sides of the playing field. </p>

<p>This is anectodal and may not be appreciated or believed, but a family friend and lifelong healthy-skeptic worked for Jones and was ...less than thrilled ...during his tenure. I don&#39;t blindly or implicitly trust the family friend, but I have no reason to distrust them, and comparing their experience with Jones&#39; own words that never seem to come to fruition, I&#39;m more than inclined to write him off as a little more than a professional fear monger.</p>

<p>In my opinion, the true kicker of all of this is that the most accurate story he ran as of late involved atrazine turning male frogs into female frogs. While demonstrable and proven in many instances, this story was memed into oblivion and turned into the &quot;gay frogs&quot; trope we so often encounter today! The irony is biting and hilarious. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was really floored. I checked it out and actually found scholarly sources on the subject. It doesn&#39;t say it turns frogs &quot;gay&quot; but rather that they turn male frogs into females. </p>

<p><a href="http://news.berkeley.edu/2010/03/01/frogs/">http://news.berkeley.edu/2010/03/01/frogs/</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Atrazine, one of the world’s most widely used pesticides, wreaks havoc with the sex lives of adult male frogs, emasculating three-quarters of them and turning one in 10 into females, according to a new study by University of California, Berkeley, biologists.</p>

<p>The 75 percent that are chemically castrated are essentially “dead” because of their inability to reproduce in the wild, reports UC Berkeley’s Tyrone B. Hayes, professor of integrative biology.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>One in ten male frogs turned female, so it&#39;s not like it happens to <em>every</em> frog, but offer me those same odds and I&#39;m not going to take the chance. The more common result was chemical castration, but that fact seemed to be all but ignored. </p>

<p>It gets weirder still! The male frogs that turn female can still mate with male frogs, but only produce male offspring. </p>

<p>All verifiable, but <em>that&#39;s</em> the story that&#39;s memed. The one time the guy picks up a story that&#39;s got some serious meat to it, he bungles the whole thing. </p>

<p>My attention was drawn to him late in the game, but it was his handling of this story that proved to me he shouldn&#39;t be trusted further than he can be thrown, and that distance decreases daily. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Alex Jones inserted himself into the 9-11 truth movement, funneled all the interested people into a dark side of fake conspiracies, and discouraged the rational people from continuing to try to expose 9-11.</p>

<p>Then, Alex Jones turned around and moved to classic Republican talking points about &quot;communists&quot; and &quot;SJWs.&quot; </p>

<p>Alex Jones single-handedly ruined the 9-11 truth movement and funneled the most naive truthers into supporting the very party that was behind 9-11. </p>
