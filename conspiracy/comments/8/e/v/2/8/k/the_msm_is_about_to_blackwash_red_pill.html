        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>For those that don&#39;t know, The Red Pill is a very popular subreddit where frustrated men go to vent about women. It has basis in reality, but it has been misdirected to lead men towards hatred of women, &quot;going their own way&quot; which eventually leads to homosexuality, and forced celibacy. It&#39;s been around for many years.</p>

<p>Today, Q gave us this link:
<a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/after-toronto-attack-online-misogynists-praise-suspect-new-saint-n868821">https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/after-toronto-attack-online-misogynists-praise-suspect-new-saint-n868821</a></p>

<p>It ties 8chan to a more extreme community (is it even real?) where violence is encouraged. We use the term &quot;Red Pill&quot; a lot around here talking about waking people up to conspiracies. </p>

<p>Prepare for a lot of confusion and misunderstanding. That&#39;s their goal. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Its been interesting watching the war of words and phrases on social and legacy media. Its my opinion that this tactic of demonizing people and ideas though language is starting to backfire for those who employ it. Words like fascist, racist, Nazi and the like have become so over used they are losing their impact. I&#39;d never been accused of being some kind of Nazi till after the election of DT and I didn&#39;t even vote for the guy. I&#39;m middle of the road/left leaning and my views haven&#39;t really changed. What has changed is the application of labels and the line between &quot;Nazi&quot; and &quot;leftist&quot; keeps getting redrawn farther and farther left. What these people fail to realize is that every time they move the goal posts farther left they are shrinking their own numbers. Counter culture is becoming &quot;conservative&quot; culture as the definition of conservative keeps expanding to include the middle/left. A large amount of the younger people I meet see the left as the people who seek to oppress and silence everyone. This is a huge change from when I was young. Growing up in the 80s and 90s it was largely the Christian right that we saw as oppressors, but that whole paradigm is shifting. I remember the good old days when the only people we called fascist were the cops who took our weed and wrote the MIPs.</p>

<p>I guess my point in regards to this post is: Yeah this is happening right now and its just the latest phrase to be co opted by the would be thought police.      </p>

<p>I was part of the PUA community, and used it&#39;s methods to get a girlfriend and eventually a wife. I still think the PUA community and it&#39;s teachings are very important for guys to learn, especially for guys who have little to no experience with women. </p>

<p>The red pill community warps the views of the PUA community for wrong and unethical reasons, where it&#39;s about subjugating women instead of getting into a healthy relationship with them. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>When you take negging to an extreme, it&#39;s a bad thing. But, there is such a thing as playful negging, which actually comes to most people as normal flirting around. I took it as a way to have playful banter, and whenever I did it, I never did it in a way that was never malicious or hurtful to the other person. I&#39;ve practiced it a lot before I met my wife, and I never had anyone offended or hurt or whatever, and even if they don&#39;t voice it, I&#39;m usually pretty good at reading people. </p>

<p>No, red pill was used for a long while, and I remember how it started with the PUA community. I used to browse the PUA sub, but the red pilled people, thought it was too tame, so they started their own sub &quot;TheRedPill&quot; which was supposed to symbolize what it&#39;s like to take the red pill from the matrix. I remember checking it out when I was in the &quot;game&quot;, and thinking how horrible the sub was compared to PUA subs. It was like as if they took the worse parts of the PUA game/community and embraced it. </p>

<p>Also read the book &quot;The Game&quot;, that talks a bit about that type of crowd. Some of the people he mentioned in the book were at one point big in the &quot;red pill community&quot;.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I used to have a friend who signed up for that PUA bullshit.</p>

<p>He introduced me to terms like “negging” where you put women down to prime them for your advances.</p>

<p>Not the same as the MRM.</p>

<p>Red Pill was the name of a documentary that a woman who used to be a feminist made about the men’s rights movement. She highjacked the term for her movie.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>When you take negging to an extreme, it&#39;s a bad thing. But, there is such a thing as playful negging, which actually comes to most people as normal flirting around. I took it as a way to have playful banter, and whenever I did it, I never did it in a way that was never malicious or hurtful to the other person. I&#39;ve practiced it a lot before I met my wife, and I never had anyone offended or hurt or whatever, and even if they don&#39;t voice it, I&#39;m usually pretty good at reading people. </p>

<p>No, red pill was used for a long while, and I remember how it started with the PUA community. I used to browse the PUA sub, but the red pilled people, thought it was too tame, so they started their own sub &quot;TheRedPill&quot; which was supposed to symbolize what it&#39;s like to take the red pill from the matrix. I remember checking it out when I was in the &quot;game&quot;, and thinking how horrible the sub was compared to PUA subs. It was like as if they took the worse parts of the PUA game/community and embraced it. </p>

<p>Also read the book &quot;The Game&quot;, that talks a bit about that type of crowd. Some of the people he mentioned in the book were at one point big in the &quot;red pill community&quot;.</p>
