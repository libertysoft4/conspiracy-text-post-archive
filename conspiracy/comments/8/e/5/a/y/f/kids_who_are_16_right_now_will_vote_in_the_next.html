    <div class="md"><p>Its a handy concept that ecompasses the different branches of &quot;conspiracy&quot; theory. TPTB could be anything from a moneyed loose group of greedy self interested capitalists, to the fabled illuminati, freemasons, jews, crypto-nazis, lizard people etc...</p>

<p>I don&#39;t agree but it&#39;s not worth arguing since it&#39;s off topic. You somehow managed to misinterpret this as a &#39;youth are the problem&#39; post.  </p>

<p>You&#39;re thinking in 2D-chess terms while they&#39;re playing 5D chess. The powers-that-be use that disgust, and even intentionally fuel it, to get the youth to be hungry for <em>change</em>. They then deliver that change in the form of the next stage of the police stage expansion &amp; global domination agendas, but cleverly packaged in LGBT-rainbow peace &amp; love gift wrap. The youth think they&#39;re voting out the old evil system but they&#39;re actually voting <em>in</em> an even more evil system with a better facade.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s actually even more clever than that.</p>

<p>The change we are seeing in youth, is a result of the Ascension process, as well as certain soul groups being born that are more loving and accepting. That is why there is much anti-bullying rhetoric in high schools all of a sudden. Read about Indigo Children, Rainbow Children, Crystal Children, etc. </p>

<p>Just like the late 60&#39;s were misdirected with drugs, the Millennials are being misdirection with Marijuana, LGBT, gun control, political correctness, diversity, etc. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The funniest part of that was an ad for an indigo colored car. I can expand it to folks already predisposed to new age theories as well as the &quot;acid every weekend&quot; crowd and folks with disabilities. There&#39;s a great deal of overlap in those groups, especially among women, and women are more susceptible to this. Both for themselves and as mothers. The way I could see this being a programming scheme is similar to what they were able to pull of with gender. The majority of the rise of LGBT, and non-binary gender people I&#39;ve met are women. Many women I knew personally would disclose some non-binary crap to me while still acting and being heterosexual women. As for the indigoes, it still feels like they&#39;re trying to engineer a social identity movement based on the anxieties created by poorer future outcomes relative to their parents that people in their 20-30s are facing, couched in the rejection of labels ascribed to them by stuffy doctors. Instead of self-identifying as depressed, bipolar, or generalized anxiety, they want people to identify as &quot;indigo&quot; or &quot;X&quot; and believe they are choosing this without being manipulated into doing so. Time will tell, but as of right now, of the many people I&#39;ve met who are mentally ill or drug users, they still use traditional medical terms and terms related to drug slang as self identifiers.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Definitely. I graduated college a few years older than the other students and have always had a more diverse friend group in terms of age, race and social status. I was often tarred for beliefs that were not all that different from theirs , but differed in terms of priorities. I put a greater value on freedom than I did safety and acceptance. They were the opposite. The idea of creating a which hunt against students in the name of acceptance is ironic. The courage state of affairs among college students is not to think for themselves or really much at all. I was granted greater freedom of speech within the classroom by foreign professors even though their countries may have hate speech clauses, but they see America for what it is and not in terms of mythology.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Herd immunity in its current definition has been debunked.</p>

<p>Herd immunity originally referred to immunity developed against diseases that can only be contracted once like measles.  Once a sufficient portion of the population was immune for life the herd is protected.</p>

<p>Vaccinations do not convey lifetime immunity, yet we still haven&#39;t had any outbreaks.  But why take my word for it?  I&#39;ll quote Dr. Russell Blaylock:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;When I was a medical student almost 40 years ago, it was taught that the tetanus vaccine would last a lifetime,&quot; he wrote. &quot;Then 30 years after it had been mandated, we discovered that its protection lasted no more than 10 years. Then, I ask my doubting physician if he or she has ever seen a case of tetanus?</p>

<p>&quot;Most have not. I then tell them to look at the yearly data on tetanus infections – one sees no rise in tetanus cases. The same can be said for measles, mumps, and other childhood infections. It was, and still is, all a myth.&quot;</p>

<p>It is not enough to simply be aware of the problems.  Karl Marx had an exquisitely sharp understanding of the problems of our corrupt system of capitalism, an understanding that remains perfectly appropriate more than a century later.  Yet, his &quot;solution&quot; is one that has slaughtered uncountable millions of innocent people across the globe.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s a quick filter: <strong>if a youth or elder has a planned solution that involves the use of centralized political power to fix problems, that person is either too ignorant to have an opinion, or a fascist.</strong></p>

    <div class="md"><p>You misread something. This isn&#39;t about the youth vs the elderly. This is about two things:  </p>

<ol>
<li><p>For every one adult mind we manage to open, the psychopaths in power can effortlessly program and close a hundred new minds.  </p></li>
<li><p>How quickly those newly program minds will start having a major effect on the world we all live in.  </p></li>
</ol>

<p>Anyone who received programming without later having that programming reversed is a problem, whether they&#39;re young or old.<br/>
The message here is that the new programming that was recently performed on the youth will very soon affect the world we all live in, because the people who received that programming will soon be old enough to vote and assume influential positions in our society.<br/>
What new programming am I referring to?<br/>
Particularly the programming for forced &quot;vaccination&quot;, support of GMO&#39;s, worship of &quot;doctors&quot; and the military, belief in the incorruptibility of the mainstream scientific &amp; academic communities and the peer-review process, support for disarming the public, support of speech censorship and acceptance of full government surveillance.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s exactly the rhetoric pushed to keep you loyal to a party that consistently does not work in your best interests. The GOP is notoriously good at siding with corporations, busting unions, and removing regulations that help assure our safety in environment, pharmaceutical, and banking regulations.</p>

<p>The Democrats are right there with them most of the time. They talk a defense when they will settle anyway and cave in. They take the publicity Brownie points and sell out to their own lobbyists anyway. Even the ACA amounted to massive, truly <em>massive</em> handouts to pharma and insurance companies.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The powers that be control &quot;science&quot;.</p>

<p><strong>Science</strong></p>

<p>Today we have the best science money can buy. Most grants to scientists and other academics at the university level come from the elite through their control of their foundations (see section on Philanthropy/NGOs). Because of this, the elite steer the direction of research by giving money for certain projects while not funding other avenues of research. All scientists are dependent on these grants and are thus controlled lackeys for the elite. Further, those projects yielding desirable results are snapped up by the elite&#39;s private interests and used to extend their control and dominance and further particular aspects of their agenda.</p>

<p><strong>Technology Given to the Public vs. the Real State of Technology</strong></p>

<p>Despite what we&#39;ve been told by the government and media, namely that we are on the cutting edge of technology, the fact of the matter is that real scientific and technical knowledge is in fact many decades ahead of what the public are given. When we look into recent history we can see this fact demonstrated over and over again. In order to maintain power and control over the masses, the elite tightly control the development and release of advanced technology to the public so that they can control the outcome.</p>

<p>The elite believe they are a more advanced form of human. In order to justify their belief they grafted Darwin&#39;s theories of biological evolution onto social organization to create Social Darwinism. Over the centuries they have referred to the public variously as cattle, sheep and &quot;its&quot; (as Plato did in The Republic) and Social Darwinism is merely the modern expression of this attitude and their elitist belief system. Under this belief system only those that have proven their worth over many generations of dominance and control are worthy of entrance into high elite circles.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>IMHO writers write what they think will catch the public&#39;s eye, or what they themselves are passionate about.  Often this includes terrifying visions of the future, and the more possible/believable the vision is, the more terrifying it is.  </p>

<p>It is said that valid arguments (valid reasoning, with true premises) are <em>truth-preserving</em>.  I think often the writings that stay are truth-preserving.

I say this as a would-be writer myself.... and yes, the sorts of ideas I&#39;ve had over the last 15 years have been mostly dystopian, although since there is so much of that I think the time is getting right for utopian stories.  Anyway, I don&#39;t think most authors are in with elites.  One thing that could be interesting though, is to see what some of the larger publishing companies print and what they turn away.

<p>what is the problem with having a single governing body</p>
</blockquote>

<p>&quot;The New World Order, although it&#39;s not really, it&#39;s called the New World Order, it&#39;s an old, old idea of having a controlled and planned world society that really is a merger of two systems and that was the Soviet system and the Capitalist system. But out of it is to come an efficient planned society. In other words, eventually down the road everyone who&#39;s born will be born only if there is a function for them to serve, and that is the key word to serve - and that is to serve the world state. People have been categorized all through their lives from school onwards from generation after generation into a eugenics program where the elite have long ago decided on who were the junk genes - meaning the commoners at the bottom - will there be a future for them? Well, they don&#39;t need them so they are going to eradicate them under the guise of overpopulation. And interestingly enough, because they know most people live their whole lives without an original thought (they really don&#39;t - thoughts are downloaded into them, opinions are given to them - they adopt opinions), they must have the consent of the public for this agenda including, down the road very very soon in fact, voluntary sterilization to save poor old mother earth and bring the population down. And when you look at what&#39;s been taught scientifically, a scientific socialism you might say, what&#39;s being taught even in kindergarten onwards today, they&#39;re giving them up towards this world where you&#39;ll sacrifice yourself if need be for mother earth. It&#39;s a religion of sorts - it uses all of the techniques of religion because religion has worked so well in the past. Michael Gorbachev, who is part of this structure for a global society, said &#39;We are creating a new world religion and it will be based on a form of earth worship&#39;. By that he meant you will literally live to serve mother earth. Of course Mother Earth has a new priesthood, there&#39;s always a priesthood, and you find its the experts, a scientific society, who already have declared they are too superior for the rest of us to be around and they have the natural right - they&#39;re the natural aristocracy as they call themselves - but in reality all scientists who depend on grants or funding from the wealthy, the already established wealthy elite, they&#39;re just the lackeys of those at the top. At the top of this system you have very old families who&#39;ve held on and acquired more and more power down through many centuries and they&#39;ve declared they&#39;re at the top of the Darwinian tree and beneath them you have the scientific society that makes the weapons for them, including weapons that will eventually control the mind, and they plan to run the whole world as a planned - not just a planned parenthood society - a planned society where every country which will be subservient to a global government.&quot;
- Alan Watt, CuttingThroughTheMatrix.com</p>

<p>New World Order</p>

<p>As we leave the age of Pisces and enter the age of Aquarius, the elite want to completely change and reorder society. They call it the &quot;New World Order&quot; and later rebranded it to &quot;Globalisation&quot; when the people started asking too many questions about what they meant by a New World Order. The characteristics of their new society are discussed in the sections below.</p>

<p>World Governance not World Government</p>

<p>It&#39;s important to understand that the elite do not want world government per se but rather a form of world governance in their personal control. A world government would imply some sort of input and opportunity for participation by the public. They have no intention of allowing this to happen. The United Nations as an unelected and as such unaccountable body has been established to serve this purpose.</p>

<p>Merger of Capitalism and Communism</p>

<p>In order to bring about global governance it is imperative that communism and capitalism be merged into a new system where economic control remains and is concentrated in private hands and social control is based on collectivism. As established by a U.S congressional investigation headed by Senator Norman Dodd into the great foundations back in the 1960&#39;s, this was in fact one of the main purposes for which the foundations were created.</p>

<p>Population Reduction</p>

<p>As stated in the section on beliefs, the elite are obsessed with over population and have written about it for centuries. Consequently, as written on the Georgia Guidestones, they want a global population of just 500 million. This means 6 billion people must die over the coming century starting in 2010.</p>

<p>Return to Feudalism</p>

<p>The elite believe that the world is simply consuming too many resources, resources that belong to them and their descendants and consequently, as outlined in the UN Convention on Biological Diversity and Agenda 21, we must return to a form of feudalism and into a post-industrial era.</p>

<p>Scientific Dictatorship</p>

<p>This new society will have different characteristics for different groups of people or classes, run in a scientific manner by a subservient group of technocratic scientific elite. In fact, today we already live in a form of scientific dictatorship where the majority of people are brainwashed from birth through the media and educational system. Ultimately, they want to develop purpose made, genetically engineered humans and only those with a purpose that serves the state will be allowed to be born and never able to understand the truth about the world in which they live.</p>

<p>Because not only is it possible for a government to be corrupted by power hungry psychopaths, it&#39;s common; and in the case of the global government that&#39;s currently being built, such corruption won&#39;t even be necessary since it is power hungry psychopaths who are <em>building</em> it.<br/>
If you don&#39;t understand the value of multiple governments, just imagine you were born under the most corrupt and ruthless government on the planet. What would want to do? You&#39;d probably want to escape to a different country. What happens when there are no other countries to escape to?<br/>
What happens when a government no longer needs to keep up appearances or make concessions, because the people  have no place else to go and no means of organizing &amp; fighting back?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Haha. Here&#39;s just a few reasons why old people shouldn&#39;t vote. Taken from a article in the Times.
Among many many other reasons. </p>

<p>No, old people vote shortsightedly, choosing the least progressive outcome. In surveys in the U.S. and the U.K., people over 65 — compared with people under 30 — were nearly twice as likely to be against gay marriage; twice as likely to be pro-Brexit; half as likely to support legalization of marijuana; nearly five times less likely to want to spend money on education; 60% more likely to vote for Donald Trump; and nearly 50% more likely to say immigrants have a negative impact on society, despite the fact that they are being wheeled around by them. Whether these figures are accurate is irrelevant, since old people are so bad at Googling.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So in summary you believe that we should take away the right to vote from &quot;old&quot; people because they do not vote the way you want them to? </p>

<p>If an idea is not reaching the older voting bracket maybe the idea needs altering to win those votes? Not just pissing and moaning about how right it is and dumb the people who vote against it are?</p>

There&#39;s many good reasons why, its not because of being agest or whatever, more they won&#39;t have to deal with the consequences of bad ignorant choices.

    <div class="md"><p>wow dude. teachers have authority over their students. kids aren&#39;t allowed to just do whatever they want at school, and we need objective measures of their progress. that&#39;s deep. we&#39;re like totally being programmed, man.</p>

<p>if anything, students are being afforded more and more autonomy with time. schools are experimenting with different grading systems and homework policies. classroom design is such that the kids increasingly face one another rather than focus on the teacher alone. discussion is better balanced with lectures. kids have more say in what they study...i remember being afforded a lot of choice in electives and could even have designed my own &quot;individualized study.&quot; plus there was the option to jump ahead to college courses, or transfer to a vocational high school, or take early release for work.</p>

<p>schools prepares us to be functioning members of society, which is sometimes stifling. that&#39;s not something that needs deprogramming. </p>
