    <div class="md"><p>Ok. I&#39;ll answer, legitimately. What you are looking for is a farady cadge. It&#39;s a mesh or metal box basicly, with a wire leading to ground. And by ground i mean a literal steel stake in the ground.  You can look in Amazon.com too they shielded bags of all sizes</p>

So I would need a full face and head guard in that case? Would an armet helmet suffice in that case? How would I go around getting such a helmet in Israel? Is it possible to buy these online? Like genuine ones? Would they even work? I still don&#39;t.</p>

<p><strong>Technology - Block All Microwaves</strong></p>

<p><strong>A Faraday Cage that is properly designed and properly grounded, will block all microwaves and will block all V2K.  It will also block all synthetic telepathy, Artificial Intelligence signals, and whatever other descriptions you have heard.  The people that designed this technology for Schriever Air Force Base are not medical doctors.  They are engineers.  Please stop listening to medical doctors to solve an engineering problem.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Your microwave oven is a good example of a Faraday Cage.  The microwaves in this case, are kept inside the cage, rather than outside.  In simple terms, a Faraday cage is a metal box or shell that conducts electricity and protects whatever is inside.  There has been a huge disinformation campaign by the CIA to convince TI&#39;s that an effective cage cannot be built.  Don&#39;t believe it.  A Faraday Cage is simple science and has been around since the 1800&#39;s.</strong></p>

<p><strong>The history of satellite weapons is provided below.  All readers should familiarize themselves with this information.  See the technology tabs at TargetedJustice.com</strong></p>

<p><strong>The Faraday Cage was invented by Michael Faraday in the 1830&#39;s.  A simple Faraday Cage is basically a box-type enclosure that will carry an electrical current on the surface and isolate the contents that are inside, from any harmful electrical effects.</strong></p>

<p><strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Faraday%5C_cage">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Faraday\_cage</a></strong></p>

<p><strong>We are providing some of the details, so you can make one yourself.  This information will be updated as we get more experimental results.</strong></p>

<p><strong>You can make one at any size that you want.  We recommend one that is sized for sleeping, since this is when the US Air Force personnel at Schriever Air Force Base will increase the targeting on your brain.  Over a long period of time, the microwaves attack the white matter tissue in the brain, and cause it to deteriorate.  We know this from the MRI&#39;s of the U.S. diplomats in Cuba complaining of &quot;sonic attacks&quot;.  A good Faraday cage will block all of these microwave attacks.</strong></p>

<p><strong>The wood frame can be built from 2 x 4&#39;s that are available at HomeDepot or Lowes.</strong>
 <strong>The recommended size for one person is about 31&quot; X 36&quot; x 90&quot;</strong><br/>
 <strong>The recommended size for 2 persons is about 31&quot; X 48&quot; X 90&quot;</strong></p>

<p><strong>The 31&quot; dimension is set by the maximum size that will go thru your doorway, if you build it in your garage.</strong></p>

<p><strong>The first choice of surface material is a high-mesh aluminum wire screen.  This is NOT the aluminum screen that is available at HomeDepot or Lowes - the mesh is not high enough.  (Mesh is the number of wires per inch.)</strong>
 <strong>We recommend a 40 mesh aluminum wire screen, if you can obtain it.  24 x 24 mesh might also suffice.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Some TI&#39;s have reported building a Faraday Cage using ordinary aluminum screen from Hope Depot.  At first, it appears that the cage is working properly.  Within a few weeks or months, the government criminals will install a higher frequency magnetron close by (usually on a cell tower), that will penetrate the aluminum mesh.</strong> </p>

<p><strong>One TI has claimed total protection using solid copper panels.  Some have reported that their enclosure shakes, although it blocks the microwaves.  This is probably am acoustic attack, meaning that acoustic waves are being used that vibrate molecules in the air.  Acoustic-Pressure waves cannot destroy brain tissue like microwaves.  This is different than directed microwaves.  Supposedly, scalar waves have been used, but this has not been proven.  More suggestions at CitizensAHT.org</strong></p>

<p><strong>The second choice of materials is Extra Heavy Duty Aluminum Foil, such as Reynolds 632 and Reynolds 633 foil.  WARNING: YOU MUST DRILL SMALL HOLES IN THE FOIL AFTER IT IS INSTALLED, BECAUSE THE AIR INSIDE DOES NOT CIRCULATE, CAUSING CARBON DIOXIDE POISONING.   Carbon dioxide poisoning can occur within one hour inside the box dimensions which have been given for one person.  It must be ventilated by drilling multiple holes with 1/64&quot; inch drill bit.  50 holes on 2 sides of the box should suffice.  The holes are deliberately small to block the higher frequencies, that the Air Force will try to use.  Keep the holes in a small area - high on one side and low on the opposite side of the box for circulation.</strong></p>

<p><strong>The total cost of materials is about $300.  It can be built using ordinary aluminum foil from Walmart.  However, this might be easily damaged.  Extra Heavy Duty aluminum foil is available from many different websites.  Reynolds 632 and Reynolds 633 are good examples of Extra Heavy Duty Foil.  The aluminum foil easily carries the voltage from the microwaves at 1 to 10 millivolts.  The frequency from the Vircator satellite weapon is about 3925 MHz.  The magnetron frequency from cell towers is typically, either 2400 MHz or 2550 MHz.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Step 1.  Build a wooden box frame out of 2 x 4&#39;s, at the size that you want.</strong>
 <strong>Step 2.  Cover the box with aluminum foil, overlapping the joints, and taping on each side.  Be certain there are no gaps anywhere on the surface. Use aluminum foil tape or a very sticky tape and SEAL BOTH SIDES OF THE OVERLAPPING JOINTS.  The glue on one side of aluminum foil tape is not conductive.  Alternately, you can use copper tape that is conductive on both sides.  (Check it with a voltmeter) Any gaps will allow the microwaves to penetrate the box.  The government criminals will attempt to penetrate the box by using a higher frequency of microwaves that can get into small cracks and larger holes.</strong>
 <strong>Step 3.  The door seal is the most critical part.  The door must be designed so that it makes a near-perfect seal.  There must be continuous contact where the door seals against the box frame.  One method for the door seal, is to use a linear sponge material and wrap it in ordinary aluminum foil.</strong>
 <strong>Step 4.  Grounding.  Use a grounding wire that is #6 gage or better to connect to the aluminum screen or foil.  (smaller number means larger wire)  Home Depot may have a wire remnants section in the electrical aisle, where you can find this wire inexpensively.</strong>
 <strong>Step 5.  Ground Rod.  Connect to a good grounding source.  We recommend NOT using the grounding rod below your electrical box.  The criminals can remotely put a signal to the ground, which may back-feed your Box.  The grounding rod will be 3 to 4 feet into the ground, as a minimum.  CAUTION:  Get someone that understand electrical connections to help you.  Alternative:  Attach to the metal gas pipe, where it goes underground.</strong>
 <strong>Use a wire brush to be certain the surface is clean and makes good contact between the wire clamp and the rod.  Check it with a voltmeter.  Clean the surface with a wire brush to be certain the clamp makes good contact with the gas pipe.  Do not use the household wiring for a ground.  The government criminals will put a signal into it.</strong>
 <strong>Step 6.  Get someone to help you test it.  Get inside and close the door.  If it seals properly, you will immediately notice a reduction in microwaves.  The government criminals will try to increase the intensity of microwaves to penetrate the enclosure.</strong>
 <strong>Step 7.  Troubleshooting.  If you are not getting a significant reduction, there is likely a gap somewhere on the surface.  The door seal or the grounding clamps are the most likely source of the problem.</strong></p>

Over this time Titan has provided advanced power supplies for      electromagnetic gun and laser research while making broader contributions      in the field of high-power microwaves (HPM). Titan&#39;s HPM work expanded      from initial efforts fielding and operating the fist gigawatt-level      oscillators for susceptibility test applications, to research and development      maximizing the peak and average output powers and overall efficiency      realized from such systems.

<p>TIs don&#39;t tend to conduct research and don&#39;t tend to read the published research cited in rebuttals and in wikis. Trust the published peer reviewed research.</p>

<p>TIs don&#39;t tend to submit meter reports inside and outside of their bed enclosure. They don&#39;t submit shielding reports. Since 2014, I have encouraged TIs to submit both. No need to be forced to blindly believe TIs whether shielding works or not. Meters exist.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Aluminum needs to be extremely thick to shield microwaves. See the Shielding: Aluminum wiki in <a href="/r/electromagnetics">/r/electromagnetics</a> and <a href="/r/targetedenergyweapons">/r/targetedenergyweapons</a>.</p>

<p>No.  It is crucial to acknowledge EMF DEW emit ultra wideband radar and ground penetrating radar. The frequency ranges of radar and of shielding materials need to be researched and submitted. I have performed some of this research. Why don&#39;t you read it and conduct research yourself on the rest? Help everyone else out.</p>

<p>Using various materials that cannot shield ultra wideband radar is useless. Lead shields ionizing radiation but not nonionizing radiation.  Carbon, charcoal, sea water, wet clay and very thick aluminum attenuate millimeter waves. Tin and copper do not.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>What if they switch to using chemicals instead to character assassinate? </p>

<p>Prior to DEW, TIs were poisoned by pesticides.</p>

<p><a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/TargetedEnergyWeapons/comments/4zxqfr/wiki_chemical_weapons_including_banned_pesticides/?st=jgh1e6e6&amp;amp;sh=20394a22">https://np.reddit.com/r/TargetedEnergyWeapons/comments/4zxqfr/wiki_chemical_weapons_including_banned_pesticides/?st=jgh1e6e6&amp;amp;sh=20394a22</a></p>

<p>The torturers do not apply pesticides to counter shielding. The torturers use a different frequency range for example heavy pressure on the top of the brain by magnetic near field. Or the torturers use ultrasound or infrasound.</p>

<p>Your post inquired about two topics: shielding of brain zapping &gt;and shielding of remote neural monitoring. Had you submitted a &gt;post on each question, the answers would be more specific.
Well I obviously wanted to know if there was a one material fits all kind of defense as of yet that didn&#39;t cost up to 1 grand. Why would I care about JUST neural or brain zapping when these terrorists clearly have access to hundreds of other methods of &quot;frequency&quot; wave terrorism that they could switch to on demand? I want something as easily accessible as water because I know G-d would not leave people without a form of defense against these philistines. </p>

<p>Tin and copper do not.
So what are they good for? Why did I find some posts recommending them? I am sure they are good to block atleast one of the frequencies... This is coming of nihilistic with all this &quot;debunking everything&quot;, sure each material by itself is useless, yet together... they could defend against a wide array of different attacks... Wouldn&#39;t you agree for once?</p>

<p>Why don&#39;t you read it and conduct research yourself on the rest? &gt;Help everyone else out.
I&#39;m flattered. What did I do exactly to come of as a NASA scientist to everyone so much that they think I have access to unobtainable and who-knows-how-expensive-equipment? Yesterday I looked into that norad4u site and even called the owner and JUST a radiation analyser is 250 dollars. Would I also have to buy a geiger counter along with it? I am not made of money. If I was I would just hire a private detector, if they exist.</p>

<p>The torturers do not apply pesticides to counter shielding. The &gt;torturers use a different frequency range for example heavy &gt;pressure on the top of the brain by magnetic near field. Or the &gt;torturers use ultrasound or infrasound.
So did they sell off all their chemical and pesticides? No, its still rotting away in some warehouse somewhere along with them. They can easily re-purpose all that garbage and use it again. This is why it&#39;s important to be vigilant, and even more paramount to be cautiously paranoid. The terrorists are making a healthy dose of defensive &quot;paranoia&quot;(how they call it) sound like a mental issue when it is one of the most healthy natural ideas. The real word is actually &quot;attentive&quot;, a word they won&#39;t allow anyone to use.</p>

<p>Norad4u is an excellent website. Geared towards people with electromagnetic hypersensitivity (EHS) or radio wave sickness (RWS).</p>

<p>norad4u has good prices and good meter reviews. Wouldn&#39;t measure millimeter waves.</p>

<p>Alternatively, test wearing several silver nylon balaclavas that I had linked to. Nylon does not breathe. Probably will be hotter than wearing 100% wool.</p>

<p>The design covers everything but steel just attenuates middle to high electromagnetic field (EMF) and low to middle microwave range. Steel does not attenuate extremely low frequency (ELF) waves which atmospheric heaters and over the horizon radar emit. Radar weapons emit ELF while targeted individuals (TIs) sleep to brain zap them. Steel does not attenuate millimeter waves. 5G and ultra wideband radar are within the millimeter frequency range.</p>

<p>Carbon attenuates microwaves, millimeter waves, ultra wideband radar and ground penetrating radar. I have submitted shielding reports on multiple layers of various kinds of carbon shielding: Carbon filters, carbon welding blankets, dry charcoal, wet charcoal, etc. The density of the carbon on filters, blankets and hats are not disclosed by manufacturers. The manufacturers do not manufacture these for shielding so neither test nor disclose attenuation specifications.</p>

<p>If it just your head you need to shield, several carbon balaclavas may suffice. Any manufacturer manufacturing them?</p>

<p>I have not researched nor tested silver.</p>

<p>If it is average level wi-fi and 4G cellular you wish to shield, several layers of silver nylon, copper nickel or nickel copper fabric may suffice.  Norad4u.com is located in Israel. Norad4u manufactures hats. I subscribe to the blog. Excellent meter reviews.</p>

<p>If it is 5G you need to attenuate, the manufacturers&#39; specifications of those fabrics are not in the millimeter range. They will not shield the millimeter range of 5G.</p>

<p>If you are a targeted individual and are being attacked by radar, several layers of those fabrics will not suffice. Carbon was not enough. I switched to wet clay and sea water.

<p>I came across a paper today which showed that multi-layer shielding prevented radiation better than single-layer shielding: <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/nucl-ex/0607032.pdf">Radiation shielding for underground low-background experiments </a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>25 different ratio configurations of material thickness were tested using Lead as the metal, PE-Bi as the moderator and PE-Li as the capture material. The best configuration for overall particle reduction is shown to be 3:8:4 (3cm PE-Li, 8cm PE-Bi, 4cm Lead).  </p>

<p>Conclusion  </p>

<p>For a total background reduction in this kind of experiment it is proposed that multilayer shields composed of a metal, moderator and capture material, are used.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>They found that if each layer was the same size (5cm, 5cm, 5cm) it did not protect nearly as well as when the material was (3cm, 8cm, 4cm). Could the same logic apply to shielding materials for DEWs/energy devices?</p>
