The first viewing was fantastic, and some of the real footage was amazing.  During the rerun, I questioned how they filmed certain shots, such as the dolphins hunting.  After spotting some really good CGI, I watched with a more skeptical eye.</p>

<p>Let&#39;s not even get into the sound track.  Jellyfish sound like Darth Vader.</p>

<p>We are going need to pay for/ use apps that tag CGI and other manipulations like we do for malware.  Watch the Manofwar fishing scene.  We need an app to tag the dramatization.  All of that fake footage slipped past me during my first distracted viewing.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is a BBC nature documentary, by David Attenborough, paid for by UK TV Licence payers. He would not have his name associated with CGI footage. It may look ‘unreal’ at parts of PE2, but the camera men (with extremely high end broadcast cameras) who have been in the business for many many years, would also not have their name associated with CGI footage. </p>

<p>Working in TV in the UK myself, I can confirm the pride within the industry for that sort of production. </p>

<p>If someone has a saved list of all non-CGI pics, wouldn&#39;t that shut them up. When I was younger and would see there math on &quot;see you can still see the tower from this far and science says you couldn&#39;t&quot; always just made me think &quot;wouldn&#39;t that mean the earth is bigger than we&#39;re told? Not flat&quot;</p>

<p>But now <em>that</em> is disproven with modern science/math/geography. You know what I mean? But that doesn&#39;t disprove CGI, which was my question.</p>

If you read an article that someone posted on here, it takes roughly five hours of footage to each minute of air time. There&#39;s going to be a lot of editing.<br/>
Whether it is fiction or not depends on whether or not you believe the end result is an accurate portrayal of animal behavior.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Once you realize that a major point of all these tv science/nature docs is to reinforce the notion that we live on a spinning ball in space, you see it pop up everywhere. </p>

<p>Problem is, they can&#39;t show a spinning ball earth from space because there&#39;s frankly not one. </p>

<p>As embarrassed as I am to admit, I was watching some NBA Playoffs yesterday and even during the game they were showing how a player was from Greece and did a totally unnecessary animation of a 3D image of ball earth showing their current location and then spinning over to Greece to show how far away it is or whatever. </p>

<p>Then you notice how many pointless uses of the word &quot;global&quot; there are and it&#39;s really quite apparent that -- I don&#39;t know how else to put it -- we are being brainwashed to hold a faulty notion of where we exist. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It was the scene with the dolphins that first triggered it for me.  The camera was swimming with the dolphins on a hunt.  I called bullshit on the perspective, then I noticed that portion was all CGI.</p>

<p>There is a scene of a turtle evading a shark near a floating log.  Plenty of real footage with angles supplemented in CGI.</p>

<p>Basically, a lot of the stuff underwater is very easy to pad with CGI without it standing out too much.  There&#39;s the scene like you are riding a whale into the darkness.  That looked like they superimposed a whale at the bottom of the screen over other footage.</p>

<p>Next time I catch it on, I&#39;ll point out some others.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I watched it on DirecTV.  This morning I set my DVR to record the next showing, which I think is tomorrow night.  To really show it, I would probably need to record a shot of the TV in motion using my phone.  That&#39;s probably some type of content violation, and the quality is going to suck.  But we&#39;ll see.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Looks like it is available on Netflix and Amazon Prime.  Maybe I can give the episode and timing when I find some free time.  I did just read in an article that they claimed to use a camera on a tow line for this particular scene.  Guess I need to see it again.</p>

<p>You can record under water.  Either way, I&#39;m not too worried about whether they doctored the audio.  (Even though I did mention it.)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>i guess. I would rather see full interactions even if they lack drama... our views of animals, their particular behaviors, as not always species specific. If they has to edit, hypothetically speaking, 7 different snake encounters to bring you the truest form of an interaction, what happened the other six times?</p>
