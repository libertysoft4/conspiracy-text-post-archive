<p>The comments were the bad part as it seems like a circlejerk of people cheering it on because these people were supposed &#39;Nazis&#39;.</p>

<p>Let me make it perfectly clear, if you call yourself a Nazi, I will probably assume you&#39;re a dumbass but that doesn&#39;t mean you should be shot.</p>

<p>Actually, the worst part is that it&#39;s &#39;left wing&#39; people cheering it on when historically, the left has been on the other side and tends to be against police abuse. It&#39;s crazy to me how divided the US is right now and how the system is able to get away with abusing people&#39;s rights.</p>

<p>That&#39;s not right to me. I like you Americans and hate seeing you guys rip yourself apart due to ideological differences.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is the thing that has been pissing me off around here for the last couple of years. I don’t know how the fuck people are upvoting support for antifa and downvoting critical posts.  From the first day of protests in downtown DC these people were destroying and vandalizing private and public property. Fuck that shit. It doesn’t matter who or what you’re protesting against. Violence is unacceptable unless you are defending yourself from physical harm. This was not the case. These idiots were just acting out like spoiled babies when things didn’t go their way. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You are in the righy sub. Putin&#39;s cat account must have gotten compromised because normally we agree on a lot of things. Like the police standardization of violent enforcement of social norms. </p>

<p>Antifa wears uniforms and gets violent mostly for the same reason Neonazis do. They&#39;ve been indoctrinated into obeying whatever authority they agree with and feel completely righteous in using violence to defend their chosen ideology from even the tiniest of threats.</p>

<p>Just like the cops.</p>

<p>Sensible and free willed people rarely join such groups, unless they mean to lead them, which usually means they&#39;re power hungry psychopaths who want to reshape the world into the image that they were taught it should possess by either the state or the church.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Weren&#39;t the fascists on the left? </p>

<p>Or the communists?</p>

<p>Left and right both use violence to justify their means. One is just more covert with it than the other.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>When I read the title of your post I absolutely thought you were going to go somewhere else with this.</p>

<p>You couldn&#39;t be more right. Fuck nazi&#39;s. Fuck racists. But what the fuck happened to the left being a liberal party?</p>

<p>They used to support the first amendment. Now they do there best to shut it down. They used to support the fourth amendment. Now it doesn&#39;t matter as long as those civil liberty violations are being used against a political foe.</p>

<p>It is disturbing to watch. I remain hopeful though. Many of those on the left are just blissfully unaware of how their party is being hijacked by radical ideologists. </p>

<p>But everyday more and more folks are waking up and beginning to question the authoritarian tone being set by those within their midst.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Don&#39;t be ridiculous, you know darn well antifa is a dirty political created and funded by the conservatives.  </p>

<p>The goals are of course, tar anyone considered liberal, and get laws that outlaw public protests and demonstrations,  but blame the liberals for the laws Republicans keep introducing to limit and eliminate public protests.  </p>

<p>That means you are a good soldier, promoting the lies that will stop your own right to protest. </p>
