    <div class="md"><p>That’s a theory I’ve been seeing lately, explaining why they turned so fast with Trump taking on the Deep State. I try to maintain a healthy level of skepticism on most things, so not saying I totally subscribe to it, (I know anything Q anon related doesn’t fare well in this sub), but it’s an interesting theory, nonetheless. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh I agree with that, for sure. The theory suggests that there was a deal allowing the Kim’s to do as they pleased, while having some level of control over them to create tensions with the US and allowing the MI complex to generate cause for military buildup and spending, as well as giving the CIA access to a completely isolated country to conduct any black site things they wanted to without interference from the outside world. There’s also the idea that NK operates as a go between for nuclear tech/weapons sales with rogue actors like Iran.... Again, just relaying what I’ve read on the theory. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Does your theory include the fact that North Korea works hand in hand with China and Russia?</p>

<p>Or the fact that North Korea just called out Israel for crimes against humanity?</p>

<p>Does it include the fact that North Korea and South Korea are getting ready to become one again and in doing so ask that America leave their country?</p>

<p>Would seem awfully weird for a CIA ran country to do such things.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Was it Trump and Pompeo or was it that the CIA were never apart of North Korea? Perhaps it was because North Korea simply didn&#39;t want to be ruled over by Europeans while the other half sold out. Perhaps with the reuniting of the country, these two nations will no longer vex each other but instead be stronger together once the third influence is eventually removed. </p>

<p>I guess in that aspect Trump did fix North Korea, their growing hatred towards America like many other countries has only brought brothers together. </p>

<p>What would happen if there was a secret plan from majority of the countries we&#39;ve invaded to all gather themselves together for war? What if Trump&#39;s presence and attitude is what was missing for them to say &quot;this is the straw that broke the camels back&quot;. </p>

<p>I am just not seeing how you are thinking this is all fantasy. It is clear Russia and China are Anti-Zionist along with their BRICS group + more as of recent. So this is not a fantasy but rather it&#39;s all coming together for the second run. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I understand your skepticism. I just think you will be pleasantly surprised by how this plays out. I honestly believe Trump is out for peace with all stable and civilized nations, and he is having to play games with bad actors who are vying for war. The brewing animosity between the US, China, and Russia is now purely theater, although it was very real under past administrations. They are working together to force rogue states and rogue agents to fall in line. Revisit what I&#39;m saying here in about a year.</p>

But that doesn&#39;t mean that somewhere up in the mountains they don&#39;t a large area blocked off with a city for the elites or something. I mean if they consider themselves better than us I can see them wanting their own place, and this would have to be closed off to the outside world. Even if someone in Korea found out, no chance that info would ever get out. And it&#39;s only natural for them to live abundantly while surrounded by millions of people suffering, in their own blocked off corner of the world. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>My take is that it was just a big social experiment. There never were any missiles- they just wanted to see how people on the ground reacted in the face of an imminent nuclear strike, and they wanted to see how the news affected the Nation at large. NK didn&#39;t fire a missile, and we didn&#39;t intercept it. The Government ran a test on the Citizens it sees as lab rats. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The alert system was hacked.  Makes waaaaaay more sense than your theory.  </p>

<p>If a projectile was launched, it would have been detected by radar by a lot of countries, and that news would not have remained silent from all of them.</p>

<p>In conclusion, your theory sucks balls</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So your telling me if someone shot a nuclear warhead at the United States our government would release that information to its civilians, when a team loses the super bowl that hometown has unrest and riots and car flipping, imagine what would happen if they were told they were literally fired at by an icbm, smh the public would lose its shit.The public is untold 90% of our governments work anyways</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The problem is several other countries are constantly monitoring for nuclear missiles.   At least 1 of dozens of countries would have said something.  Countries like Germany who have a good relationship with their press would have at least had a headline.  No way did america somehow tell them all to say nothing. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>the alert was real. The alert lasted 38 minutes. this is the same amount of time it would have taken the nuke to travel from NK to HI after launch.</p>

<p>The detection system was spotty and generally crappy. The nuke was taken out by deep secret tech or possibly an ET AI. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Was it Trump and Pompeo or was it that the CIA were never apart of North Korea? Perhaps it was because North Korea simply didn&#39;t want to be ruled over by Europeans while the other half sold out. Perhaps with the reuniting of the country, these two nations will no longer vex each other but instead be stronger together once the third influence is eventually removed. </p>

<p>I guess in that aspect Trump did fix North Korea, their growing hatred towards America like many other countries has only brought brothers together. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I understand your skepticism. I just think you will be pleasantly surprised by how this plays out. I honestly believe Trump is out for peace with all stable and civilized nations, and he is having to play games with bad actors who are vying for war. The brewing animosity between the US, China, and Russia is now purely theater, although it was very real under past administrations. They are working together to force rogue states and rogue agents to fall in line. Revisit what I&#39;m saying here in about a year.</p>
