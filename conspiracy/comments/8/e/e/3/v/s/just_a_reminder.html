There is evil in the world, it&#39;s the duality of magnetism making itself known through human nature. A weird fundamental concept of thermodynamics. But, remember that the internet started as a tool for war, we developed nuclear bombs before power plants, etc. Don&#39;t underestimate the power of good in all of us. Don&#39;t get discouraged. This world/intelligence is complex for a reason. And I truly think the end result is good. So don&#39;t give up, and if you have a good heart remember to speak up.

<p>Natural law (Latin: ius naturale, lex naturalis) is a philosophy asserting that certain rights are inherent by virtue of human nature, endowed by nature—traditionally by God or a transcendent source—and that these can be understood universally through human reason. As determined by nature, the law of nature is implied to be universal,[1] existing independently of the positive law of a given state, political order, legislature or society at large.</p>

<p>Irrelevant to our conversation right now.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>And it was written by men, </p>

<p>Irrelevant. Furthermore, do you feel the same way about math/sciences (for example)? They were also developed and written by men.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>it is not a natural law by any stretch of the imagination. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes, they are: &quot;<strong>that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights</strong>&quot; Meaning, no man or institution (Government) can take them away. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Who defies &quot;equal&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It&#39;s right there: &quot;Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.&quot; If you are a human being, you have certain unalienable Rights. That&#39;s what equal means, this context.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>how can you have a &quot;right&quot; to life when you are dependent upon another human to acquire that life and to stay alive for several years. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Good illustration about finding agreement, I disagree that competition is the driver.  I think it is need, individual, family, community, an outward expansion of needs to be met and goods and services to meet them.  </p>

<p>I am not sure though what kind of competition you mean?  do you mean for social and financial status?</p>

<p>Or are you saying competition produces the frictions of social and financial status and that is the need, to win a place in a hierarchical system?</p>
