        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>A man in a white van ran over 10 pedestrian today in Toronto.  Video of the suspect&#39;s capture exists.  In the video the man threatens to shoot the cops.  He gestures violently with his cell phone in what appears to be an attempt at Suicide by Cop.  The suspect is calmly arrested by the officer.</p>

<p>The big take away is the amazing calmness of the Toronto Police Officer.  This is some fantastic press for the TPD.  In fact it may help erase their numerous scandals including:</p>

<p>1) Bungling the Serial Killer Investigation
2) Cops eating weed brownies on the job
3) Shooting of unarmed suspects</p>

<p>I propose that this incident is a staged event by Toronto police services. The purpose of which to revamp the image of Toronto Police Services.</p>

<p>Good Day</p>

Under my scenario the victims would be crisis actors. The media likes to speculate on possible motivations for incidence. What&#39;s wrong with me speculating. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s called crisis management. The toronto Police reputation is in crisis.  They hire a crisis management consultant.  The firm suggests staging a scene of an officer remaining amazingly calm and professional under incredible stress. Voila</p>

<p>Check out the Toronto Subreddit.  Every other comment is about how amazing the Toronto Police Services handled this situation.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If a drug-user/criminal becomes successfull, and a good person, people give him acolades.  Few people give praise to the man that was doing good from the beginning.  I think this could explain part of the reason for some of the praise.  Also, it&#39;s possible it was just handled especially well.  I do believe in coincidences.   Killing 10 people by van is too much just for PR.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Local CTV news in Toronto has some decent coverage <a href="https://www.ctvnews.ca/canada/toronto-police-say-9-dead-16-injured-after-pedestrians-struck-suspect-arrested-1.3898118">https://www.ctvnews.ca/canada/toronto-police-say-9-dead-16-injured-after-pedestrians-struck-suspect-arrested-1.3898118</a></p>

<p>I have been following this story since the incident happened and noticed right away that the police image was being pumped up. There were a lot of witnesses that watched the carnage happen up close and personal so I don&#39;t think the incident is fake or staged, but when I heard that Justin Trudeau commented publically within minutes, I was suspicious. It went political way too fast, IMO.</p>

<p>And the cops are being pumped up as heros way too much and way too early.</p>

<p>Others here in my city, which is a couple hours from Toronto, are also wondering why-tf this is being plastered all over the media and questioning why it&#39;s so politicized so fast.</p>

<p>It&#39;s just too slick of a narrative. Can&#39;t say any more on it though since the &#39;suspect&#39;s&#39; details haven&#39;t been released.</p>

<p>But one thing I do know about Toronto cops - they&#39;re wannabes and if they&#39;re seeking out media attention it&#39;s only to make themselves look good. They&#39;ll glom onto any tragedy to pump themselves up so they look good because the true reality of their image has far less lustre than they&#39;ll admit.</p>

<p>You can put a pretty dress on a pig, but it still stinks like a pig.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Highly disagree- from Toronto, live here- was close by when it happened a little more north on the highway. I believe our cops just aren&#39;t stupid A) they have to go through way more training than American cops so he realized very quickly and easily the cellphone was not a gun B) Our cops don&#39;t GENERALLY shoot first and ask questions later - it has happened a time or two- but not very often. C) it was very apparent the suspect wanted to be killed- its likely a worse punishment to him to take him alive - they probably thought of that. D) if it was a coverup and orchestrated they likely would have shot him so he didn&#39;t talk - we seem to not see many false flag suspects making it out alive if history tells us anything. This is a really bad theory and I don&#39;t like how you&#39;re trying to incite conspiracy around an event that was clearly not planned by the Toronto police. IF ANYONE planned it - I&#39;d say , and a very small chance on this as well- I&#39;d say it was the Conservative party to shed light on how Justin Trudeau needs to stop letting fucking everyone with a heartbeat into the country. If this gets used by the Conservative party in the coming elections- it will seem more likely they had a hand in it, but even still- it&#39;s likely just a crazy mother fucker that fucked up a lot of people&#39;s day and needs to rot in jail being buttfucked on the daily. </p>
