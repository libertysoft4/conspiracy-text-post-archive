A cell block in the UK was ravaged by a fire and never fell, surely that wasn’t as structurally sound as the twin towers? </p>

<p>Engineers make the best assessment they can, on available information. In the many years since 9-11, more evidence comes to light. Assessments must be reevaluated. </p>

<p>The video I saw recently showed a viable sky directly through front facing windows. This showed clearly that the building (at least one of them) was hollowed out before the fall. I have no doubt that poor engineering standards of the day helped lead to the building&#39;s collapsing. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well all the engineers I’ve seen have commented that to get the towers to fall, all of the core columns would have to be cut, and thats the only way the towers could come down in such synchronicity.  If you look at the columns after the collapse they show the signs of controlled demo as they are cut in a diagonal manner. Which also explains the squibs and all the explosions heard. </p>

<p>Tell me about tower 7 then? How did that fall when there was no jet fuel and no significant impact to the building? And the fires were nowhere near hot enough to cause a collapse. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;After 7 hours of uncontrolled fires, a steel girder on Floor 13 lost its connection to one of the 81 columns supporting the building. Floor 13 collapsed, beginning a cascade of floor failures to Floor 5. Column 79, no longer supported by a girder, buckled, triggering a rapid succession of structural failures that moved from east to west. All 23 central columns, followed by the exterior columns, failed in what&#39;s known as a &quot;progressive collapse&quot;--that is, local damage that spreads from one structural element to another, eventually resulting in the collapse of the entire structure.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I can’t take anything published in popular mechanics seriously. </p>

<p>One column collapses and the whole tower comes down? Somehow that just doesn’t make sense to me. Again as the building was basically reduced to a pile of dust. The kinetic energy of one floor falling on top of the others isn’t enough to make the whole building collapse and basically disappear. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Also molten steel, described as looking like lava by firefighters, was found at the scene days after the towers went down.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>&quot;Under certain circumstances it is conceivable for some of the steel in the wreckage to have melted after the buildings collapsed. Any molten steel in the wreckage was more likely due to the high temperature resulting from long exposure to combustion within the pile than to short exposure to fires or explosions while the buildings were standing.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Completely false. </p>

<p>The new WTC7 uses the exact same design as the twin towers as well as the old WTC7. </p>

<p>It is a common design because of the increased floor space. And it’s very safe building within a building construction. It is not an empty hole in the middle for the walls to fall into, it is a dense cage of steel beams. </p>

<p>The new WTC7 was the first building to be raised at Ground Zero and it was finished 2 years before NIST’s Final Report on WTC7 was complete.</p>

<p>So they built it before any building code recommendations were made and it’s designed exactly the same as the 3 buildings that collapsed.</p>
