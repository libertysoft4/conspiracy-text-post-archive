<p>The problem is there are far more people than there are the “entity” - people just choose to ignore what’s in front of them. We (so called “conspiracy theorists”) have the duty to continue to educate the masses and make a call to action. It’s slow, but it has proven effective. </p>

<p>This is certainly true.</p>

<p>For an example, I have tried to share with people the idea that <a href="http://fakeologist.com/blog/2018/02/24/fac433/">War is a hoax</a>. If the people at the top run <em>all</em> of the countries, why would War be real? Sure, there might be armed conflicts, but this is not &#39;war&#39; as understood by the masses.</p>

<p>Most of the time, even &#39;awake&#39; people have emotional reactions (anger) when I raise this point.</p>

<p>Yes, that would be different from &#39;war&#39; as understood by the elites.</p>

<p>Although war often profits the elites, it also exposes large populations to combat training. After the war, those former troops are dangerous to the elites, especially in socially tense situations.</p>

<p>The elites have to control the military firmly, all the way down the chain of command to ex-sergeants. That means, in a way, the war will &quot;benefit&quot; the common people. It&#39;s a very tricky social puzzle piece.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>To some the truth is more important than victory.</p>

<p>Some people just want to know.</p>

<p>Others want fame for exposing things.</p>

<p>Others want justice or fairness.</p>

<p>Others just have a shitty feeling about the way the world is going.</p>

<p>The one thing I have discovered looking through all these conspiracies is that the majority of them are bullshit, designed to distract, trap or scare people into this exact mindset.</p>

<p>&quot;Oh well it&#39;s all hopeless, what&#39;s the point.&quot; From everything I&#39;ve seen, these people are just that: people. Greedy, moralless psycho and sociopaths who actually have far less power than they would have you believe.</p>

<p>There is no ultimate secret they possess, no alien knowledge, no magic - no demon summoning. It&#39;s all an illusion, just as Varys said in Game of Thrones &quot;Power, is a shadow on the wall and a very small man can cast a very large shadow&quot;.</p>

<p>These people are weakling, scared little bitches with long knives and lots of money. They&#39;re dangerous but their plan is far from assured.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Inner peace.</p>

<p>It’s quietly comforting <strong>knowing</strong> when something is bullshit.</p>

<p>I’m <em>almost</em> at the point now where I don’t try to seek alternative explanations too. When I first entered this scene I was all about “lifting the veil” and “exposing truth”, but I’ve found that to be mostly a futile endeavour. Such high quality evidence to affirm a particular theory rarely exists, so you end up in a cognitive limbo where you <strong>know</strong> something is false but there is nothing to fill the gap left behind.</p>

<p>As I get older I’m less bothered leaving the gap I filled, and not knowing the whole truth. I am increasingly satisfied just being able to spot bullshit when I see it.</p>
