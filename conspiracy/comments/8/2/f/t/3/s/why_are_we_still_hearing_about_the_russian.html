<p>Then, Clinton was complicit in the obvious sabotage of Bernie Sanders campaign. </p>

<p>Hillary routinely and publicly refered to the lower classes as &quot;deplorables. </p>

<ul>
<li>Used the joint fundraising agreement towards almost solely the benefit of Hillary Clinton.<br/></li>
<li>Used their contacts within the media to publish negative stories about Bernie Sanders, as well as negative stories about Sanders supporters.<br/></li>
<li>Gave Hillary Clinton debate questions in advance.<br/></li>
<li>Altered the debate schedule to favor Hillary Clinton.<br/></li>
<li>Worked with state parties to move primary dates around to put Hillary supporting states&#39; primaries early in the calendar to add to the narrative of her inevitability.<br/></li>
<li>The pied-piper strategy (though that didn&#39;t have anything to do with Bernie Sanders or the primary).</li>
</ul>

<p>None of that is election rigging.  Most of it is, sadly and unfortunately, legal.  Imo it&#39;s a clear violation of Article V Section 4 of <a href="https://www.demrulz.org/wp-content/files/DNC_Charter__Bylaws_9.11.2009.pdf">The DNC&#39;s Charter and Bylaws</a> which states:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In the conduct and management of the affairs and procedures of the Democratic National Committee, 
particularly as they apply to the preparation and conduct of the Presidential nomination process, the 
Chairperson shall exercise impartiality and evenhandedness as between the Presidential candidates and 
campaigns. The Chairperson shall be responsible for ensuring that the national officers and staff of the 
Democratic National Committee maintain impartiality and evenhandedness during the Democratic Party 
Presidential nominating process. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Raising money and accepting donations from people who believed that the DNC was abiding by that charter while they were, in fact, not abiding by that charter, might be an example of fraud, but that&#39;s a civil case.  Corporations and non-profits (The DNC is registered as a non-profit) again, sadly and unfortunately, don&#39;t usually have people go to prison over fraud and/or violations of their charter and bylaws.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh..  I&#39;m sorry...  Let me be super clever and change this password from &quot;password&quot; to...  umm...  &quot;p@ssw0rd&quot;.  There.  That&#39;ll do nicely.  It&#39;s even recorded in his very own emails, y&#39;know, <a href="https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/22335">right here</a>. Don&#39;t worry about the link.  I know CNN said <a href="https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=-beYBLrkNAg">it&#39;s illegal</a> to have these, but I checked with my lawyer, and I think we&#39;ll be alright.</p>

<p>If I leave the keys in the car, and my neighbor steals it, do I get extra money for blaming the russhins?  I can see why people would get on board with that.</p>

<p>And handwaving around the <em>structure</em> and legalese of the election rigging doesn&#39;t make it not election rigging.  Isn&#39;t it kinda bizarre that we can froth at the mouth about russhin meddling, or something, when we have <em>actual, institutionalized</em> election rigging, which is perfectly legal as last ng as the web of laws, bylaws, and charters isn&#39;t penetrated?  You&#39;ll sit there and rave about Russia&#39;s interference, without the slightest worry that our elections were rigged before the russhins even entered the scene.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You seem to think I never said anything about the DNC&#39;s bullshit during the primary.  You seem to think I didn&#39;t just spend paragraphs talking about it today.  </p>

<p>Maybe you think we should throw the people who screwed Bernie in prison, just because, but we have laws in this country.  </p>

<p>DWS was fired. Brad Marshall was fired. Luis Miranda was fired. Amy Dacey was fired. Donna Brazille is gone. All the top leadership has been removed, and since Tom Perez was named chair, most of the middle leadership has been replaced too. The DNC is pretty much now either new people or elected officials from the bodies of the state chapters. The candidate they cheated in order to help lost.  She did not prosper.  The public has been made aware of what they did. As a result of what the DNC did, the DNC has pretty much lost most of their donation streams, at least of the small dollar variety, from the most enthusiastic, willing to help, section of their base. They&#39;re being sued in several courts for violating their charter &amp; bylaws while accepting donations under that charter.</p>

<p>To what extent the DNC can be held accountable for their actions, they have been held accountable and they are being held accountable. </p>

<p>How much more accountable do they need to be held?  What do you think should happen to hold the DNC more accountable before we even start to look at who committed the data thefts?</p>

<p>Trump went into the real estate business with this man in 2006, a man who pleaded guilty in 1998 to a stock fraud scheme perpetuated by the Russian Mafia. Real estate is an often used form of money laundering. Guess what year Trump leaked his tax returns? 2005. Coincidence? </p>

<p>Like that, right there. You&#39;re trying to minimize it. Russia&#39;s information warfare takes many different paths, and you&#39;re pretending that the MSM is just jumping from one to another at will making it up, instead of reporting the news that comes out about it.</p>

<p>You&#39;ve quickly proven there is no use in arguing with you. I understand our government has flaws, and has done bad things before, but you&#39;re just a nut tbh lol. Really?

<p>Like that, right there. You&#39;re trying to minimize it. Russia&#39;s information warfare takes many different paths, and you&#39;re pretending that the MSM is just jumping from one to another at will making it up, instead of reporting the news that comes out about it.</p>

<p>You&#39;ve quickly proven there is no use in arguing with you. I understand our government has flaws, and has done bad things before, but you&#39;re just a nut tbh lol. Really? A tyrannical fascist government? Monitoring our every thought and action? I&#39;d love to see what you look like if you could post a picture.</p>

<p>Is it over?  No?  Then you don&#39;t know what evidence there is, and you won&#39;t until it&#39;s over.  Why are you trying to get people to dismiss it when we don&#39;t even have the results?  The least you could do is wait and see.  </p>
