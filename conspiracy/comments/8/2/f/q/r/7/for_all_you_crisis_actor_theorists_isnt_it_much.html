<p>If you need &quot;crisis actors&quot; to sell the drama, that suggests real people suffering a tragedy won&#39;t show sufficient emotion.</p>

<p>Yet the typical way people &quot;spot&quot; crisis actors is that they&#39;re insufficiently showing grief.</p>

<p>Everyone shows/expresses grief differently and saying they are &#39;acting&#39; because they are not showing the emotion some people expect is completely absurd. I&#39;m not saying it&#39;s not possible, people need to realise everyone is different.</p>

The only conspiracy is the shady efforts the gun industry has used to shut down objective debate into the topic (such as, for instance, bankrolling laws that make it impossible for the CDC to study how gun ownership impacts health and safety -- literal censorship), abetted by politicians who rely on &quot;gun-grabber&quot; fear-mongering to hide pro-corporate looting.</p>

The one university shooting in Australia in 2002 where 2 people died and 5 had non fatal injuries, it was stopped because people attacked the gunman even though they were unarmed. You guys have find everywhere and fail to stop these things.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Personally I think they do kill actual people, no reason to suspect they don’t it illicits more fear. Crisis actors are the people that come on the news after a crisis to drive the narrative in a direction. To say people don’t actually die is like saying the earth is flat, and is used to discredit theorists.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Do they have to be actors though? This is where the theories lose me and a lot of other people. Folks like David Hogg don&#39;t have to be made up characters, they can be real people who actually experienced this tragedy but were manipulated or paid off to gladly campaign for whatever agenda the establishment wants promoted. It&#39;s really not even a conspiracy anymore, its just Public Relations 101. The real conspiracy is that its promoted as being entirely natural and the public should totally buy into it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes they do have to be actors. You want to be able to control the narrative. If you allow people that you do not know what they will say on the main stream news outlets to speak to the masses you could have people saying that someone on the grassy knoll shot JFK. However if you silence or discredit people who would say that and just have a bunch of people saying &quot;no I seen the shooter he was in the 6th floor window.&quot; Oh and he looks just like lee harvey oswald....then you can say a witness seen him shoot the president. </p>

<p>Or in cases like this you would have teachers or students out talking about how they were planning drills. Or how the shooter was more than one. Or that the shooter looked like a police officer. Or you would have witnesses saying they seen and talked to who  (the actors) are saying shot up the school.</p>

<p>But yes real people were there. Real people died. Real people are not the ones that are being interviewed over and over and over and .... </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Genuinely curious about this so please don&#39;t assume I&#39;m just trying to attack or discredit. For those who strongly believe in the crisis actor angle, how do you explain none of the other students coming forward and basically saying &quot;We have no idea who the fuck this person is.&quot;</p>

<p>If your school was used as the center ground for a false flag attack, where you know for a fact real students and teachers died, and then all the sudden these complete strangers are speaking on your behalf, why don&#39;t they speak out? Are principals paid off as well? You can say every student might not be aware of every other student in their school, but surely another teacher, coach, or administrator would come forward and say &quot;We have no idea who these people are or why they are saying they went here.&quot; Or is the idea these actors have been undercover for the past 4 years, being a normal student and just waiting for this attack? </p>

One of them would know that they weren&#39;t actually students at the school and ask questions.

    <div class="md"><p>Would it be out of the realm of possibilities to have a kid like Hogg who is already a student at the school be recruited into whatever this is, and play a part? Or do these crisis actors only have to come to the scene after the events? 
If they are capable of staging this kind of scenario then they are fully capable of controlling both sides. The action, and the story after the action. 
I go back to the Aurora, CO shooting. This guy was going for his PHD at an area known for MKUltra type of programming and studying. It is fully plausible that they would program him to kill. And if they are able to program someone to kill they are able to have actors or &quot;Agents&quot; lie in wait to be activated to tell the story. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That is what I am leaning towards at this time. It seems like school shootings or mass casualty events have become different...strange.
Do kids/people die in these? yes. It is what comes out in the few hours after and then the narrative that is driven. The well organization of the victims and the drumming narrative much like on 9/11 with Osama bin Laden as the culprit. 
Then you have exercises ran by groups showing how easy or how they can &quot;blend into&quot; society. Sleeper cells that can be activated when needed. 
If you sign up for the idea that someone other than this Cruz kid was a lone shooter or the FBI just messed up or if he was programmed then it is very likely that they can have someone planted to talk about it after. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>For the sake of discussion, it should be noted that I&#39;m not necessarily a believer in the &quot;crisis actor&quot; explanation but for arguments sake: What would really need to be done to ensure that they were a student? I have a friend who is a counselor and he suggested the system really isn&#39;t that secure and wouldn&#39;t be that hard at all to tap in to and load a &quot;student&quot;. </p>

<p>As far as the teachers not knowing, I would use the same argument. Every teacher isn&#39;t going to know every student by face and name; they may just assume that he must be in another class or on another team. The only reason why they are considered &quot;high profile&quot; is because they ended up in front of a tv camera the day of the shooting.</p>

<p>You can say every student might not be aware of every other student in their school, but surely another teacher, coach, or administrator would come forward and say &quot;We have no idea who these people are or why they are saying they went here.</p>

<p>Especially the high profile ones like Hogg, if he was a paid actor and is suddenly thrust in the spotlight, wouldn&#39;t there at least be a few students/faculty calling foul?</p>

<p>What I could believe is MSM focusing only on the viewpoints they want expressed (pushing a narrative), they found Hogg expressing gun-control related views and focused on him, while other view points from students were ignored. For example, most left leaning MSM (CNN) focused on gun-control and students expressing those views, while right leaning MSM (Fox) focused more on other narratives, like Colton Haab and &#39;CNN Scripted questions&#39;, false flag attack, paid crisis actors, etc.</p>

<p>There is evidence that the main people (Hoggs, etc.) on the &#39;left&#39; side are indeed real and authentic (teachers, police, other students, etc.). Is there evidence those on twitter are real/authentic and not a fake account? 4chan loves to troll during events like these.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The term crisis actor is being misused. David Hogg is acting a political activist for this Crisis. He&#39;s being fed lines and is preaching the ideas of people better than him.

<p>And you conveniently skipped over the part where she states very clearly &quot;The shots were coming from the other side of the building, there definately had to be 2 shooters, I believe&quot;</p>

<p>Where in the OFFICIAL narrative was the mention of 2 shooters?  There was not, so this is clearly contradicting it.  No?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>In the age of social media if a verified survivor from Parkland, whether staff or student, came forward and said David Hogg is not a real student, that would be heard. Someone on this very forum, other students, other staff, people from other conspiracy forums would see that message and you&#39;d be hearing about it. Maybe not on MSM, but it&#39;d be out there. </p>

<p>As far as I&#39;m aware, there&#39;s none of that. Someone above posted a link to a twitter account with a snapchat video of David Hogg with the caption &quot;MY LAB PARTNER IS A CRISIS ACTOR.&quot;. They claim this is from before the attack but with no way of verifying the date it was taken, it&#39;s much more probable this is from after the fact and is a self aware jab at the attention Hogg has been getting, who is on record as saying they all think the accusations are hilarious. That video is the closest thing I&#39;ve seen to someone from inside claiming he&#39;s an actor and it&#39;s completely unreliable. </p>

I&#39;m more likely to believe you if you put even a little effort into proving you were actually there.

    <div class="md"><p>Just want to clear up a major misconception you are having here. An “actor” doesn’t mean that they didn’t actually go to the school or something like that. It means that they are driving a specific narrative that has come down to them from somewhere higher up than themselves. Crisis actor in this context does not have to mean someone brought in from offsite. It just means someone that the State/Media complex owns, and will do and say as told. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t see why. There are Parkland kids who don&#39;t agree that gun control is the problem. They just don&#39;t put them on TV. That seems like controlling the message pretty effectively. It&#39;s not that hard to get people to say what you want on TV. </p>

And yes David transferred to that school. They were from Rodondo Beach area prior. He graduated middle school from there. At least that is what we have been told by his graduation photos circulating from his late moms facebook pictures. Although the graduation garb matches more with the high school than with the middle school. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Exactly. They don’t need to be actors, they don’t need to be paid, and they don’t necessarily have to be manipulated either, they just need to be managed. A big school is going to have students with lots of opinions, someone just needs to find students with opinions that match their goals, coach them enough to get them on message, and get them in front of as many cameras as possible.

<p>Several of the obits from the Parkland school shooting actually kinda look legit. Most don&#39;t.</p>

<p>You think that these psychopaths are going to fret over a few collateral deaths?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s all about being able to control the narrative.  It seems to me that in some of these events people really die and other they don&#39;t.  I think the architects of these events &#39;get off&#39; psychologically if they can social engineer the publics mindset using a completely fabricated event without anyone even being killed.  They feel like they are smart enough to do a &#39;magic trick&#39; on everyone and it may be more rewarding to them and easier to control the outcome.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Bingo. They&#39;re rituals to these people. What more could you do to the public but to convince them and illicit an emotional reaction to something that didn&#39;t even happen. Now I obviously believe real events happen as well that they will gladly manipulate as well but some seem downright sloppy to me. They get off on knowing that some people dont buy it which is why there are always certain numbers used in the events and things like that. It&#39;s magic to them imo. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, indeed.</p>

<p>When you are speaking with somebody who believes that there are actual deaths taking place in these major media event, ask them if they believe TPTB are &#39;evil&#39; or &#39;satanic&#39;: they will invariably respond in the affirmative.</p>

<p>They are analysing these events through biased/jaded lenses: when you are already convinced that the magician is evil, you will have no problem believing that he is really cutting the woman in half (and not bothering to put her back together again).</p>

<p>If instead you open your mind to the possibility that the magician is <strong>not</strong> evil, then you can analyse the data of these events objectively, and very quickly it becomes clear that nobody died, nobody got hurt.</p>

<p>This will be far too difficult for dogmatic &#39;they are evil&#39; believers to grasp. Those of us who can see through the meta-deception are effectively the elite of the &#39;conspiracy&#39; realm, and I predict that we will always be in the minority.</p>

<p>Clearly some of the people interviewed were all part of the pre-arranged narrative, others who were there, first responders and simply innocent bystanders who were also interviewed were also added to that mix because they didn&#39;t get asked anything that might conflict with that narrative or if they did they simply edited those comments out or cut them altogether. All to make a convincing presentation that seems to hang together. The mix of the real and the fake sets up enough confusion to keep what really happened from being revealed or resolved.</p>

<p>We can use at least four different methods of finding the real perpetrator though: checking who had the means, motive, and opportunity, who benefited from the crime, who has an already proven record of misleading the public in other cases and lastly be sure that our theory has a predictive power (like a prediction that agencies which are established exactly for use in secret operations with military weapons and explosives will in fact use explosives in secret operations).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think you misunderstood the post, they&#39;re suggesting the foolishness of constructing an entirely false crisis in place of a real shooting of innocent people, e.g. why sign the New Town parents up to a lifetime acting gig of &quot;grieving parent&quot; when an insidious group could actually kill an innocent kid for the desired effect far easier.</p>

<p>i think you generally get a handful of them involved just to parade them in front of the cameras. what is interesting is how they seem to push this a such an all or nothing proposition, either there are no actors, or everyone would have to be.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If it helps you any, OP, I’ve worked in news (engineering/IT) for more than 10 years and have yet to see anyone come in for training or be paid for a disaster narrative. And I spend about 8 hours a day in the middle of the newsroom, helping journalists producers and editors earn their bread.</p>

<p>It’s amazing to think normal people like them would be able to mastermind and hide such a narrative when I help them change their passwords every 3 months by changing the number on the end.</p>

<p>Trust me - journalists are really good at journalism but terrible at doing all of the other things that would be needed to subscribe to a tenth of the things they are accused of here.</p>

<p>...that’s what I’m there for ;)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>They need the crisis actors (IMO a special group of CIA recruits) either way.<br/>
They need them to deliver the script to the media and get involved in pushing the political agenda behind the staged attack.<br/>
Very useful because they carry with them the <em>victim shield</em> that allows MSM to shame anyone who questions their motives, behavior  or legitimacy.<br/>
As far as dead victims go: You don&#39;t want to kill innocent people if you have an interest in convincing your co-conspirators (and maybe even yourself) that you&#39;re the good guys, especially not when your organization has full ability convincingly fabricate people to kill off.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Bingo. They&#39;re rituals to these people. What more could you do to the public but to convince them and illicit an emotional reaction to something that didn&#39;t even happen. Now I obviously believe real events happen as well that they will gladly manipulate as well but some seem downright sloppy to me. They get off on knowing that some people dont buy it which is why there are always certain numbers used in the events and things like that. It&#39;s magic to them imo. </p>
