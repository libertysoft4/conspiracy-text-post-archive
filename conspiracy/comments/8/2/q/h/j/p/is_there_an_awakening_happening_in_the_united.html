        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>This is a very broad topic that is open for discussion and the free exchange of ideas. Over the past few years, I have personally experienced a shift in the American people and the increasing level of dissent directed towards the US government as a whole. It is hard to put into words, but it seems as of recently that the American people are tired of being fed lies, and it also seems that the general public is willing to display this through online commentary.</p>

<p>When browsing social media platforms like Twitter and YouTube, this can easily be seen through tweet replies and YouTube comments. For example, a recent post on r/conspiracy brings attention to a tweet by the department of defense. This tweet essentially outlines how the DoD works hand-in-hand with Hollywood to produce propaganda war films. The replies listed underneath the DoD&#39;s tweet are generally those dissenting the US government as a whole. I know that one tweet isn&#39;t indicative of a large-scale movement, but this can be seen in the comment section of YouTube videos from channels like CNN, MSNBC, etc. So much so, that many videos from MSM YouTube channels regarding hotbed political topics have their comments disabled. This can also be seen on mainstream news websites, where comment sections are generally being disabled altogether. To me, this indicates a widespread push to suppress dissenting options that question the mainstream narrative. MSM may say that comments must be disabled to fend off trolls, but I think that may be a convenient excuse to suppress constructive conversations.</p>

<p>I used to think that a good portion of the American people fell victim to propaganda spewed by mainstream media, but now it seems as if people are done putting up with the bullshit. Will there be a push to suppress and hide free speech online in the future? Could it be happening as we speak? Where do you think we are headed as a collective people?</p>

<p>Agreed that somethings are hard to digest raw, but we&#39;re not cows -- we&#39;re not supposed to live off veggies alone. Fruits should make up the bulk of our diet, and they&#39;re easy to digest raw.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Fruits are considered cold and light. If one has a cold and light body (Skinny and cold skin), then this diet would exacerbate this issue and cause disease. If you are heavy and hot bodily, then fruit diet may be helpful. Depending on your body type, you should choose foods that offset the qualities of the body. Don&#39;t fall into these diet fads that are based on creative mental speculation. We are meant to eat all foods, either cooked or raw, depending on our constitution.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks, I&#39;ll have a look. The bitter/sour/salty/sweet thing does ring true, but I have to point out that cooked food was not an option for millions of years while our bodies were evolving, before we invented fire. And our bodies haven&#39;t changed <em>that</em> much since -- e.g., we have long intestines and relatively weak stomach acid like other primates... who eat mostly fruit.</p>

<p>It&#39;s not &quot;creative mental speculation&quot;; it&#39;s figuring out what fuel our bodies were designed for.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I personally dont subscribe to evolution or the idea that fire was invented. It&#39;s pretty much a story they sell to us in elementary school. </p>

<p>This universe is cyclical and has existed eternally. All beings are eternally existing, manifesting and unmanifesting perpetually. Cooking has existed eternally. The idea that we have evolved is just modern society trying to sell to us that we are &quot;advanced.&quot;</p>

<p>I do quite well eating a balanced diet of fruit, grains, beans, and vegetables. Our bodies are most definitely suited for these foods. Not sure how you leave out our intellect in cooking food in the whole equation...wouldn&#39;t this also need to taken into consideration? Why is our intuition to cook food not taken into account in this story?</p>

<p>It&#39;s all a story man. The truth is, humans have cooked food far longer than modern society will lead us to believe.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Much of our &quot;intuition&quot; is programmed by culture. I used to have intuition to drink a lot, to eat lots of meat. If my family raised me eating mostly processed crap, my intuition would be to eat processed crap. We&#39;re not a blank slate. And very nefarious forces are working to degrade our health for profit and control. So our intuition needs to be balanced by intellect. Intellect + intuition = intelligence </p>

<p>You can examine the human body and see what it&#39;s designed to process and what it&#39;s not. Our digestive systems are designed like other primates, from mouth to anus, and they eat mostly fruit, dark leafy greens, and some raw nuts and bugs. We don&#39;t have crops to sprout and digest grains like birds. We don&#39;t have advanced stomachs to digest tough vegetables and grasses like cows. We don&#39;t have short intestines like cats. We&#39;re not designed to process those things. They damage our bodies.</p>

<p>Grains damage our intestine which, in turn, form a protective layer of mucoid plaque -- but this also inhibits absorption. Cooked fats form long carbon chains that clog our liver and kidneys. As such, they block the processing and excretion of metabolic waste, leading to serious &quot;dis-eases&quot; such as &quot;cancer&quot;. I can&#39;t speak for chilled vs warm dairy; I&#39;d need to see research on that.</p>

<p>I, too, believe history goes in cycles, but I don&#39;t believe advanced humans have existed eternally. There were others, and we were the simpletons foraging in nature for our food.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think this whole idea of being a primitive eater is a trap. I&#39;ve tried eating only fruits. I was weak and tired all the time. And broke. This thoery is based on speculation that we didn&#39;t have access to cooking materials. That&#39;s total imagination. Eating cooked grains with leafy greens is healthy. Grains by themselves can be bad. Leaves by themselves make us weak.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, it&#39;s very basic, simple logic: Look at your body hair. We wouldn&#39;t survive the night in most places, let alone the winter, before the advent of tools and fire. Except the tropics. We&#39;re good there. This is the environment our bodies developed for originally, for millions of years, then maybe 10,000 years adaptation to other climates.</p>

<p>Without fire and tools, the obvious staple in the tropics is fruit. It&#39;s everywhere, year-round. I live here, and it&#39;s one of the best things about living here. I also think eggs would be included. Chickens love fruit scraps and are a sort of symbiotic species. I can&#39;t imagine their eggs were simply ignored by humans. (Of course there&#39;s a huge difference between eggs from a chicken running around eating bugs and fruit scraps and eggs plopped out by a factory chicken fed GMO grains, hormones, and antibiotics.)</p>

<p>It&#39;s not about being a &quot;primitive eater&quot;, per se; it&#39;s about looking at our bodies and determining how to fuel them. Like if somebody give you a car and no instruction on how to fuel it, you could look at the components and slowly figure out what it runs best on. (Ironically, most people pay far more attention to what they put in their car than what they put in their body.)</p>

<p>My approach is to take as a that base: fresh, raw fruit and dark leafy greens. Then modify it based on what I know about my family&#39;s history. Mom&#39;s side came from Scandinavia (fish); Dad&#39;s side came from Germanic areas (lots of eggs, milk, and a bit of chicken). Then use my head to combine the two.</p>

<p>I still think the fruit/veggies diet was ideal, but we&#39;ve drifted away from that and developed deficiencies. I don&#39;t know if I even can get back to fruit/veggie alone in this lifetime. Could take several generations.</p>

<p>Thanks for admitting that. For me, my time/attention/finances are sacred and allow/buy me my freedom which is not worth sharing with someone who requires more of these things from me.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Seems like for some, this is a fair trade. Some, who choose to follow the path I take, make their own food, do their own laundry, and initiate sexual needs if the opportunity comes up, but do not worry about it if its turned down or not there. </p>

<p>I have found that, the more I don&#39;t care about certain things, the more certain things care about me and/or show up in my life.</p>

<p>On a deeper note though, the modern westernization of women has created a toxic personality, princess syndrome, dishonesty, and so many other archetypes come to life, that its become a war zone. That&#39;s not to say, that if someone showed up who was well balanced, consciously aware, and traditional in various ways, that I wouldn&#39;t necessarily turn down something longer in nature</p>

<p>Kudos to you, though, for not succumbing to the dating ritual, which can be an extremely dysfunctional societal norm. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>We are headed exactly where we are supposed to... Either everything matters or nothing does. Most people who would be seen as &quot;asleep&quot; simply choose to focus on things that effect their general vicinity. Their lives are fulfilling and their goals are easily attainable to them. Nothing else matters, or is perceived as fluff. Something that enriches their already satisfactory life.  But the awakening we speak of is just the notion that the human experience should be far better and more free for everyone. If the world leaders have any semblance of a plan or goal to push us all towards a higher standard of living then it would ultimately come down to the people&#39;s willingness to cooperate. Or not. And the leaders ability to maintain their responsibility. And it looks, to me, like slowly but surely most people are realizing that they do in fact want more out of life( more answers, more experiences, adventure, etc ..) and the leaders are not always doing the job we expect them too, with potentially deadly results  The only way the world moves properly is if there is full disclosure and transparency of our past crimes, and future plans. Only the &quot;awake&quot; people ( or awakening ones) realize that we have become stagnant in our progress as a species ( despite public opinion of massive change) . Perpetually placing band-aids and walls over industries to maintain some control over a chaotic world.  And don&#39;t have the proper concrete foundation to truly rely on the already in place practices of flawed, ultimately similar, humans in control.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Honestly, I would have been more likely to say yes in 2016. Then, you had people from several parts of the spectrum questioning key aspects of the system. You had the Bernie supporters questioning the neoliberal establishment Democrats, and Trump supporters questioning the Republican establishment. In other words, people were questioning their own sides&#39; more establishment views. </p>

<p>Since the election and the <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/taibbi-russiagate-trump-putin-mueller-and-targeting-dissent-w517486">rise of the Russiagate narrative</a>, this anti-establishment critique has really given way to pro-establishment support on both sides of the aisle. Much of the left, even those who supported Sanders, are now siding strongly with neoliberal Democrats against what they see as the greater evil of Trump. Much of the right is standing behind Trump uncritically, thinking they really have one on their side this time. Most dissent outside these narrowly defined positions receives derision from both the fake left and right. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree. It makes my head spin trying to understand how we went from “questioning” in 2016 as you said, to staunch support. 
The post earlier today highlighting all of the “former” military intelligence dem candidates running for mid terms is startling. Do we really want to hand over almost complete control of our country to warhawks and spooks? We have calls for everyone to vote straight ticket dem for fear of the dreadful republicans, without concerns for the outcome. I can’t imagine any of this will end well for the US. </p>

<p>It really seems that everything has been turned inside out and no one seems to notice. If they have noticed they either aren’t speaking out or are being silenced, likely a combination of both. </p>
