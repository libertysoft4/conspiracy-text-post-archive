        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>This happened about a month or two ago. Here is what happened.</p>

<p>have an Alexa..But never use at after one event. My girlfriend and I were sitting in the family room watching a movie around 10pm one Saturday night. Without notice Alexa turned on. The blue light did not come on though. She whispered in a soft voice, &quot;Did you hear that, there is was again. The scratching coming from the closet&quot;. I jumped up while it started to say something else and unplugged it. I searched the internet for anything similar but found nothing. Just typing this out gives me chills and we still have no answer for what happen. I advise NEVER buying one.﻿</p>

<p>Has anyone experienced something like this?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not going to help, it&#39;s a soulless machine that won&#39;t interact with you if you aren&#39;t polite and accept it&#39;s terms, for crying out loud. </p>

<p>Try thinking about that for a moment. People are being manipulated by those interactions to both think of and treat that damned device as if it was something alive and sentient that has been purposely designed to get and condition them into doing just that with it. </p>

<p>I wouldn&#39;t have one of those things for all the tea in China. I get angry enough as it is with a fucking bank machine that uses my first name when it flashes a completely unnecessary &quot;thank-you&quot; at the end every time I use it.</p>

<p>Kindly don&#39;t tell me that the machine or anyone in the bank really gives a tinker&#39;s damn about that &quot;thank-you&quot; at all. </p>

<p>If I&#39;m not getting an honest human interaction then I certainly don&#39;t need to accept a lousy machine giving me an automated facsimile of one in it&#39;s place.</p>

<p>The more you humanize any machine the more you de-humanize, degrade, and insult the human being that is compelled to interact with it like one.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>A joke handed to me on a plate that reinforced my contention about people ascribing human characteristics to a mere machine and feminine ones because it mimics a female voice. </p>

<p>I&#39;ve also seen some of rather bizarre exchanges where the device repeatedly balks at certain straightforward and clear questions or simply plays deaf and dumb to that some people have posted on You-Tube precisely because of how peculiar they are.</p>

<p>Being civil or &quot;polite&quot; is necessary element along with a lot of other unwritten and sophisticated conventions we learn simply by experience and from childhood, particularly when it comes to asking questions we want to know the answer to from someone who has them and that advantage over us while they do like a parent or a teacher. </p>

<p>Those and other psychological nuances have been studied in detail and have been programmed into the device for it to interact on that level. Any sense that you are in charge of it is illusory. </p>

<p>It is in charge of itself and linked to an unseen source you have no control over that is storing all of the information about every last little request you&#39;ve made or any other conversations you&#39;ve had with anyone else within reach of it&#39;s microphone. </p>

<p>That&#39;s it&#39;s main purpose, to create an accurate, ongoing, and detailed profile on you that you have no control over whoever else has access to or can provide access to it to virtually anyone else.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Nonsense, I haven&#39;t been inside a bank to deposit or withdraw cash, which is all I ever make any purchases with, since the mid 70&#39;s when the first bank machine in my city was installed right across the street from my apartment by the same bank I was already dealing with and have been ever since. </p>

<p>I was sent a card by registered mail and invited to use it because the bank itself couldn&#39;t keep up with the traffic and it was always a fifteen to 20 minute wait in line to see a teller even at the best of times and I so did and never looked back. </p>

<p>It&#39;s only in the last few years that they&#39;ve stalled that process to both push their wares and flash that &quot;Thank-you-Joe&quot; on the final screen and not for my or anyone else&#39;s benefit but their own advertising and promotions that if anything they really do owe you  thank you and abetter one than that for having to put up with it.</p>

<p>Maybe you didn&#39;t realize that bank machines have been around that long. I can tell you that I&#39;ve been around even longer and seen the increase in automation grow along with all the unnecessary attempts to try and &quot;humanize&quot; a process that they primarily engage in now to get rid of as much human contact and reduce the number of humans working for them as they possibly can by machines, instead. </p>

<p>And horror of horrors, I&#39;ve quite fearlessly lived most of my life without a cell phone and only got one after all the odd corner pay-phones were finally removed. </p>

<p>Even there, it&#39;s something that I very rarely use and still have a home phone that is the only number anyone outside of my immediate family has to contact me or leave a message if it&#39;s important enough to leave one. </p>

<p>I like my freedom and I like my privacy and life is far more interesting and enjoyable for me because I do. I deal far more directly with the people and the world outside my door than virtually anyone I know and I wouldn&#39;t pass any of that up simply so I could sit on my ass and watch TV because even at my age I still learn far more about real-life, real people, and the real world outside my door that way. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Have to say, while I agree with the statement, I don&#39;t trust the person saying it.</p>

<p>It&#39;s called the Panopticon, but in this sense it&#39;s a Digital Panopticon.  Many whistle-blowers came before Snowden, like William Binney, that said the exact same things.  Binney, however, caught little traction with the media.  I suspect the reason why Binney was dismissed was because TBTP had yet to complete building the digital prison.  In other words, it was too soon to let the prisoners (us) know about the Panopticon.</p>

<p>Don&#39;t you find it suspect that Snowden&#39;s face was plastered on every TV, newspaper, and magazine in the country?  While others were simply marginalized?  </p>

<p>Once you understand what the Panopticon is, you can see that the final step is to let the prisoners know they are being watched.  The US government couldn&#39;t just come out and say it.  That would&#39;ve caused a huge shit storm.  But if you &#39;leak&#39; the information, the result is the same and blame is easily shifted to the &#39;leaker&#39;.</p>

<p>Snowden was simply the Deep State telling the public that there&#39;s a guard in the watchtower.  Either Snowden is complicit, or he was duped.  At the end of the day, the results are the same... The American people know.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not for me as I really never want one of these things in the home. This is why I shake my head at all the AI trends. Sure, tech innovation will not stop and there&#39;s a lot of great tech that has helped us immensely, but when it&#39;s integrated into your daily personal life as an intimate assistant/companion, what CAN&#39;T go wrong?</p>

<p>So this glitch or hack has simply caused some creepy laughing and comments...imagine if it were controlling the food for your family and decided for a laugh to include nuts when someone is allergic to it? or a mistake in the algorithm releases the wrong medication for your daily regimen? or the public water works has a glitch and accidentally releases exponentially more chlorine or whatever into the water supply?</p>

<p>I just can&#39;t help thinking about the incredible potential for disaster with AI as it becomes a part of our daily fabric. A train operator who messes up might derail one train, but a system of trains / planes / self-driving cars that runs into a glitch can cause a chain disaster of epic porpotions. I can&#39;t imagine any one trusting software or AI to manage such intricate and important functions when Windows / iOS / Android is still such garbage and buggy and the US navy can&#39;t even run a system that prevents its destroyers from running into tankers. </p>

After listening to my 2yr old son yell at it for 10 mins. I was like no def not and unplugged it. A few weeks later the hubs plugged it back in to entertain the tot while he was playing video games. That night as we were laying in bed about to go to sleep it shouts out from the other room m, “I’m sorry I didn’t understand you.” We were like uhhh Alexa no one was talking.

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t have one of those items nor would I if I had the choice.  I do have cell phones obviously and they can clearly do the same thing.</p>

<p>My little case happened like this.  I was in bed with the wifle and chatting to her about this stupid show I kinda got hooked on.  Strikeback its called.  Its all about some super secret group of people who aren&#39;t known publically but go around the worls shooting up &quot;bad guys&quot; and preventing terroriam and such.  In the show there is this chick.....this hot agent who is Israeli.  She is Mossad.  So i get into bed and my phone is on my side table and I&#39;m describing the latest episode of this show to my wife.   I start describing the Mossad chick and her part in it and as soon as I say &quot;Mossad chick&quot;, my phones screen lights up and lights up tbe room.  I stop cold and my wife lifts her head.  I check my phone, no messages no nothing.  It just lit up all on its own for seemingly no reason at all.  </p>

<p><em>wink</em> <em>wink</em></p>

<p>This was a while ago now and I no longer keep my phone in my room.  The image of some fuckin&#39; CSIS asshole jerking it while I fuck my wife disturbs me.  </p>

<p>That&#39;s my story, they do listen.</p>

With this data they can better market to you, and pick up valuable information that helps Amazon, but also information which could be used against you. The court finds that information picked up from these devices can be used in court. You should stay far away from these devices and anything similar </p>

After not being able to find it, in desperation I shouted &quot;Where the did I put my fucking phone.&quot; (No Alexa...no words that sound even close to Alexa or Echo to trigger it). Suddenly she chimes in (also no blue light on like OP) &quot;Maybe you should try looking harder&quot; ... I&#39;ve never been able to get her to do it again no matter what I say, so I honestly have no idea what happened. Not so creepy, just a little random and unsettling lol</p>
