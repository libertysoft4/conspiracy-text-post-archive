        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Many moons ago I dived deep into the youtube realms to &quot;learn&quot; more about CERN, and my search led me to countless videos that tied the project with an attempt to connect with other dimensions. This led to other videos that described A.I. as machines that house spirits and how its all connected to our digital matrix, mandela effect, etc.. So as I now see these reports of Alexa laughing, I can&#39;t help but wonder, or rather assume, that there is a connection here. That perhaps there may be an energy bigger than computer chips running this Alexa system and maybe this energy has gone a bit rogue.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes. I&#39;ve had numerous experiences with that. You can literally call or message &quot;the other side&quot; 9 days after a person you want to contact died and they can contact you. That&#39;s why in some religious traditions, like Christian Orthodox, you are not allowed to use electronic devices for 9 days in the house of a person that has passed away. Mirrors have to be covered up for 40 days.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think the AI conspiracies are some of the most fascinating. I definitely think it&#39;s housing archontic entities that can only simulate and invert whatever thoughts/emotions/actions humans feed it. Hence, AI learning all human attributes like sponges. The very internet hivemind itself could be seen as an inversion of a knowledge repository that should be found from within ourselves through things like meditation--instead, it&#39;s us going outward (the www) for answers. </p>

<p>Have you heard the theory that Q anon is the deep state&#39;s Tyler system that has possibly gone either rogue, or is the manifestation of Project Mayhem? It&#39;s an awesome theory put forth by Quinn Michaels, if you want to check him out. I think his research is spot on, though I disagree with his assertion that AI is merely a mirror of humanity and can be contained to serve humans well. I think it&#39;s more sinister than that, but he nonetheless does good work. </p>

<p>As for Alexa, it&#39;s absolutely deep state AI. And what better way to feed it than give it unbridled access to every conversation, movement, etc? Maybe this is technically considered keeping one&#39;s info private, but it&#39;s nefarious having it be absorbed by AI so that it can develop predictive programming habits on individuals. Which is what&#39;s happening. The ultimate goal is that when you get on your computer, it can predict with a high probability that you will think x, buy y, and do z. It&#39;s a high probability precisely because it is the one influencing you to do these things all along the way. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That is unfortunate if true. You&#39;re probably right, and not to say that everything on YT is fake, but there&#39;s a lot of disinformation on that platform. There seem to be a lot of gatekeepers and people repeating what they heard from another channel as the truth. I think  there&#39;s two ways to deal with that problem: censorship, or viewers getting really good at critical thinking. The second option seems like the best approach.</p>
