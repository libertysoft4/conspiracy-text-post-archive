        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I think the term anti vaxxer is a misnomer. It’s not that people are against vaccines, it’s more like they are pro-quality control.</p>

<p>What’s wrong with that?</p>

<p>If you got medical people and CDC people and Democrat and Republican politicians talking about mercury or sterilization agents or whatever in the vaccines, at the very least you should look into it. I’m not saying it’s true or not. I’m saying it deserves honest investigation.</p>

<p>If you’re about to drink your soda, and your friend tells you your sister spit in it while you were in the bathroom, you going to think twice?</p>

<p>Personally I don’t give a fuck one way or the other about the vaccine issue. I have no stake in the outcome and have pretty much washed my hands of your species, so do what you want. But it’s hilarious when vaccinated people think unvaccinated people are a threat. Well, your kids are vaccinated, what are you worried about?</p>

<p>To all the parents who don’t vaccinate your kids: That’s your free will. Don’t listen to this mandate shit. But if your kid dies of something that could have been stopped with a vaccine, then hey live with it. You fucked up. One more dead kid, the world moves on. Walk it off.</p>

<p>Same goes for you pro vaccine nuts. If you give your kids a bunch of vaccines and your healthy kid becomes a drooling idiot fucked for life, then hey, congratulations on being a shitty parent and live with the fact you ruined your kids life. Pat yourself on the back and try to make the next one normal.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This isn&#39;t about food or water. You&#39;re the one who started talking about survival and you are also the kind of person who assumes that everyone else is unprepared except for yourself. I gave you not even a hint of information regarding how I live my life yet you assume so much. We live in the 21st century but if you want to live like you&#39;re still in the Stone age that&#39;s your prerogative.. but that doesn&#39;t mean you have to live in a life of fear like it seems you do. You are afraid of disaster and you are afraid of needing to rely on other people. I get that. But that has made you selfish and probably think that just because you don&#39;t need anyone else to survive they are screwed and you are not. You should not look down on people who use faucets or don&#39;t grow their own food. We have an economic system where as a society everyone works together to form a web of goods/services and are able to enjoy the fruits of everyone&#39;s labor. You will only get to enjoy the fruits of your labor because you prefer to cut yourself off from the modern day way of life. Why are you so afraid of catastrophe? Why do you feel the need to belittle others who like being part of an economic team and not run solo? What kind of disasters are you afraid of? I&#39;m honestly asking you these questions with the hope that you will answer them because people like you boggle my mind.</p>

<p>Capitalism, or more specifically, ethical competetion, is the reason shit gets done and advancements are made.

    <div class="md"><p>Ah, the good ol&#39; &quot;herd immunity&quot; lie.</p>

<p>&quot;Is Herd Immunity Real?</p>

<p>In the original description of herd immunity, the protection to the population at large occurred only if people contracted the infections naturally. The reason for this is that naturally-acquired immunity lasts for a lifetime. The vaccine proponents quickly latched onto this concept and applied it to vaccine-induced immunity. But, there was one major problem – vaccine-induced immunity lasted for only a relatively short period, from 2 to 10 years at most, and then this applies only to humoral immunity. This is why they began, silently, to suggest boosters for most vaccines, even the common childhood infections such as chickenpox, measles, mumps, and rubella.</p>

<p>Then they discovered an even greater problem, the boosters were lasting for only 2 years or less. This is why we are now seeing mandates that youth entering colleges have multiple vaccines, even those which they insisted gave lifelong immunity, such as the MMR. The same is being suggested for full-grown adults. Ironically, no one in the media or medical field is asking what is going on. They just accept that it must be done.</p>

<p>That vaccine-induced herd immunity is mostly myth can be proven quite simply. When I was in medical school, we were taught that all of the childhood vaccines lasted a lifetime. This thinking existed for over 70 years. It was not until relatively recently that it was discovered that most of these vaccines lost their effectiveness 2 to 10 years after being given. What this means is that at least half the population, that is the baby boomers, have had no vaccine-induced immunity against any of these diseases for which they had been vaccinated very early in life. In essence, at least 50% or more of the population was unprotected for decades.</p>

<p>If we listen to present-day wisdom, we are all at risk of resurgent massive epidemics should the vaccination rate fall below 95%. Yet, we have all lived for at least 30 to 40 years with 50% or less of the population having vaccine protection. That is, herd immunity has not existed in this country for many decades and no resurgent epidemics have occurred. Vaccine-induced herd immunity is a lie used to frighten doctors, public-health officials, other medical personnel, and the public into accepting vaccinations.</p>

<p>When we examine the scientific literature, we find that for many of the vaccines protective immunity was 30 to 40%, meaning that 70% to 60% of the public has been without vaccine protection. Again, this would mean that with a 30% to 40% vaccine-effectiveness rate combined with the fact that most people lost their immune protection within 2 to 10 year of being vaccinated, most of us were without the magical 95% number needed for herd immunity. This is why vaccine defenders insist the vaccines have 95% effectiveness rates.</p>

<p>Without the mantra of herd immunity, these public-health officials would not be able to justify forced mass vaccinations. I usually give the physicians who question my statement that herd immunity is a myth a simple example. When I was a medical student almost 40 years ago, it was taught that the tetanus vaccine would last a lifetime. Then 30 years after it had been mandated, we discovered that its protection lasted no more than 10 years. Then, I ask my doubting physician if he or she has ever seen a case of tetanus? Most have not. I then tell them to look at the yearly data on tetanus infections – one sees no rise in tetanus cases. The same can be said for measles, mumps, and other childhood infections. It was, and still is, all a myth.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, it&#39;s actually pretty bad in reality. If herd immunity actually worked, cases like this would not occur:</p>

<p>&quot;An outbreak of measles occurred in a high school with a documented vaccination level of 98 per cent. Nineteen (70 per cent) of the cases were students who had histories of measles vaccination at 12 months of age or older and are therefore considered vaccine failures. Persons who were unimmunized or immunized at less than 12 months of age had substantially higher attack rates compared to those immunized on or after 12 months of age. Vaccine failures among apparently adequately vaccinated individuals were sources of infection for at least 48 per cent of the cases in the outbreak. There was no evidence to suggest that waning immunity was a contributing factor among the vaccine failures. Close contact with cases of measles in the high school, source or provider of vaccine, sharing common activities or classes with cases, and verification of the vaccination history were not significant risk factors in the outbreak. The outbreak subsided spontaneously after four generations of illness in the school and demonstrates that when measles is introduced in a highly vaccinated population, vaccine failures may play some role in transmission but that such transmission is not usually sustained.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That’s really not so bad. Yeah, the vaccines failed, but they still mitigated the spread of the outbreak. That vaccine was probably flawed and insufficiently researched, as many are when the primary motive is profit.</p>

<p>That doesn’t mean “vaccination” is a bad thing, though it does make me curious about what “vaxxers” interpret “anti-vaxxers” motivation to be. Who stands to benefit from the anti-vax movement?</p>

<p>To be clear, I agree that vaccines are insufficiently researched and in many cases dangerous. I think things like the flu vaccine may be especially harmful. But I also see that vaccinations are in some cases necessary to prevent major outbreaks of more deadly illnesses.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>He never said tetanus is contagious. He is using the example of the tetanus vaccine and it&#39;s non-existant immunity as a comparative example to contagious disease vaccines. Both were said to give lifetime immunity, both were discovered to not give lifetime immunity and in fact gave waning immunity if any at all, and both tetanus and the contagious diseases being vaccinated for were in decline and basically non-existant in regards to mortality before the vaccines were introduced.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>He doesn&#39;t have to say it&#39;s contagious for this to be a moronic non-sequeter.</p>

<p>Who cares if fewer people are being infected by a non-contagious disease that&#39;s typically the product of rusty nails and animal dung? How is that a conclusive sign of the ineffectiveness of the vaccine for the disease?</p>

<p>And even if it were, what does that have to do with herd immunity in <em>contagious</em> diseases? How does situation one map to the other?</p>

<p>If the link seems &#39;obvious&#39; to you, try actually spelling out the logic in explicit terms. A common trick of lesser conspiracy theorists is to bury their central premises.

    <div class="md"><p>How so? The tetanus vaccine is ineffective, and even if it were effective, tetanus was so rare it didn&#39;t need vaccination to begin with.</p>

<p>Comparitively, measles, mumps, rubella, etc. were on the decline and mortality rates fell drastically before the introduction of vaccines. Thus using ineffective vaccines for diseases that were not deadly or rampant to begin while providing less effective immunity than one would recieve by getting the diseases naturally makes no sense. </p>

<p>The two situations are very similar and the comparison is quite effective whether you want to see it or not.</p>

<p>&quot;There are three critical factors that must be true in order for the Herd Immunity Theory to work.</p>

<p>Vaccines must be 100% permanent. </p>

<p>They must provide complete immunity for life. The only way to catch a disease must be directly from another person that has the illness. </p>

<p>Vaccinated people must not be able to transmit the disease.&quot;</p>

<p>Mandatory vaccines do not allow for informed consent. If you decide to read up on vaccines and refuse based upon reformed consent, you risk a variety of state enforced repercussions.</p>

<p>Your child will not be able to attend school. You risk losing your child to CPS and your child may be taken from you and vaccinated against your will.</p>

<p>Also, the vaccine makers are not liable for damages so it does not factor into their decision to push vaccines onto our children.</p>
