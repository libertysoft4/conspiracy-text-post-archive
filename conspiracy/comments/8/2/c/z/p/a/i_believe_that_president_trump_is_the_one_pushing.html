<p>The inspector general has concluded that Mr. McCabe authorized F.B.I. officials to provide information for that article, according to the four people, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the report before it is published.

    <div class="md"><p>What am I to gain from this article? She wrote a speculation piece on the memo before it ever came out and got the reason for McCabes removal wrong. She used the phrase &quot;lashed out to&quot; which isn&#39;t a phrase.</p>

<p>She says he&#39;s facing conflict of interest investigations which <a href="http://thehill.com/blogs/blog-briefing-room/news/367701-fbi-ruled-mccabe-had-no-conflict-of-interest-in-clinton-probe">isn&#39;t true</a> and she cites nothing to back that up. She wrote that weeks after he was cleared for the Hillary investigation according to that hill article. </p>

<p>She quotes this man, &quot;“There are people lining up in the bureau to go after McCabe,” said a former FBI official, with knowledge. “There will be a clean up at the Bureau of his cronies.”&quot; but clearly made it up since no one else has been &quot;cleaned up.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>They have definitely gotten worse. His own house and senate couldn&#39;t pass an obamacare repeal that they campaigned on for almost a decade. Bring that up once near this november and every R is toast. His tax cuts sucked, his trade war sucks, the stocks suck, his nuclear threats suck. People would probably elect teenagers over republicans this november after the whole pedophile and rapist thing this year. All this and we may have more indictments by the time elections come around, that would be real bad after playing fake news for 2 years.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I bet you thought Clinton would win too, huh? How&#39;d that work out for ya? The Democrats were on the wrong side of the government shutdown. Choosing illegals over Americans isn&#39;t a very popular platform to run on. Obamacare wasn&#39;t repealed, I&#39;ll give you that. But the individual mandate that I&#39;ve had to pay a penalty for the past several years was. That&#39;s pretty fucking big. Maybe you think the tax cuts suck, but I&#39;m rather enjoying the extra cash lining my pockets. I&#39;m not going to pretend to know much about trade stuff, but I&#39;m pretty sure he was clear about that shit during his campaign, so it seems to me that that would be a promise kept. Nuclear threats, geesh. After 30 years of the POTUS sucking N. Korea&#39;s ass I&#39;m glad that somebody has the balls to call them out. Maybe something will actually get done. </p>

<p>We&#39;ll see what happens in November. I know one of the biggest platforms he ran on was immigration reform/wall. He can&#39;t get that shit through congress even though he&#39;s offering up amnesty for nearly 2 million illegals. Why do you think that is? Because the Democrats refuse to play ball. The Republicans need 60 votes to pass. They only fill 51 seats. You think the people that really want immigration reform in this country aren&#39;t aware of the stonewalling being done and that they actually need more seats? I think they&#39;re smart enough and will more than likely be very ready to rally their base and get people into the polls come November. I do like it though that you cats think it&#39;s a slam dunk because historically it&#39;s gone one way. Isn&#39;t that what Clinton thought about a few states up north, hence she didn&#39;t bother to campaign there?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>His approval rating has been steadily ticking up. It’s at around 50% atm. The polls for the 2018 midterms show the democrats losing points. They were +15 but now they are within the margin of error, showing a tie. The democrats are broke and in debt. They have no popular candidate and their platform is “we aren’t Trump”. </p>

<p>The California Democrat Party just refused to endorse Dianne Feinstein. She was almost beaten by a Progressive candidate but he didn’t receive enough votes either. The party is fractured.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Seems like you&#39;re being facetious, but yeah, some lefties did vote for Trump because he successfully positioned himself as being &quot;anti-interventionist&quot;. While Clinton was saying she&#39;d respond to alleged cybercrimes committed by Russia with the military, threatening direct war with a nuclear power over allegations of hacked emails, Trump was the closest thing to an anti-war candidate either major party allowed us. I personally went for an actual anti-war candidate in Jill Stein, but there are definitely lefties out there who were willing to pick Trump over Clinton for his being less war-hungry during the election. If I had been forced to choose between Clinton and Trump, I would have chosen Trump just due to the fact that one seemed to want war with Russia and the other one seemed to not.</p>

<li><p>Another client of HSBC Geneva to donate to the Clinton foundation is Denise Rich, the ex-wife of the late billionaire and commodities trader Marc Rich, who fled to Switzerland in 1983 after being indicted by US authorities for tax evasion, fraud and racketeering. Mark Rich was was controversially granted a presidential pardon by Bill Clinton just hours before the former president left office in 2001 - <a href="https://hotair.com/archives/2015/02/10/clintons-got-81-million-from-hsbc-tax-avoidance-figures">https://hotair.com/archives/2015/02/10/clintons-got-81-million-from-hsbc-tax-avoidance-figures</a></p></li>

<h1>EDIT: There are users i have blocked in this thread because it was recommended to me by <a href="/u/sabremesh">/u/sabremesh</a> that are claiming the US did a real investigation into Magnitsky’s death which isnt true.  The government made the decision based on information given to them by Bill Browder.  If you watch the Bill Browder deposition i linked above it is very long but you will see this.  The users I blocked said they didnt have the time or were not willing to watch it.</h1>

<p>The inspector general has concluded that Mr. McCabe authorized F.B.I. officials to provide information for that article, according to the four people, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the report before it is published.

<p>And you are too retarded to read it. Cool man. IDK what source you are talking about and whatever you have it isn&#39;t called liberalism. Seriously, ask your doctor, it is great that you are spreading awareness but get your disorder properly diagnosed.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I bet you thought Clinton would win too, huh? How&#39;d that work out for ya? The Democrats were on the wrong side of the government shutdown. Choosing illegals over Americans isn&#39;t a very popular platform to run on. Obamacare wasn&#39;t repealed, I&#39;ll give you that. But the individual mandate that I&#39;ve had to pay a penalty for the past several years was. That&#39;s pretty fucking big. Maybe you think the tax cuts suck, but I&#39;m rather enjoying the extra cash lining my pockets. I&#39;m not going to pretend to know much about trade stuff, but I&#39;m pretty sure he was clear about that shit during his campaign, so it seems to me that that would be a promise kept. Nuclear threats, geesh. After 30 years of the POTUS sucking N. Korea&#39;s ass I&#39;m glad that somebody has the balls to call them out. Maybe something will actually get done. </p>

<p>We&#39;ll see what happens in November. I know one of the biggest platforms he ran on was immigration reform/wall. He can&#39;t get that shit through congress even though he&#39;s offering up amnesty for nearly 2 million illegals. Why do you think that is? Because the Democrats refuse to play ball. The Republicans need 60 votes to pass. They only fill 51 seats. You think the people that really want immigration reform in this country aren&#39;t aware of the stonewalling being done and that they actually need more seats? I think they&#39;re smart enough and will more than likely be very ready to rally their base and get people into the polls come November. I do like it though that you cats think it&#39;s a slam dunk because historically it&#39;s gone one way. Isn&#39;t that what Clinton thought about a few states up north, hence she didn&#39;t bother to campaign there?</p>
