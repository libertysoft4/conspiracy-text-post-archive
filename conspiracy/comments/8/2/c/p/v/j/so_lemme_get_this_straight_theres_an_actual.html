    <div class="md"><p>They knew the leak came from an American citizen who was known to post pictures of himself in American Flag outfits, who died under very mysterious circumstances soon after.</p>

<p>The leaks showed that the DNC was willing to &quot;teach a lesson&quot; to leakers.</p>

<p>Despite this information being fact they decide to mislead the public and say that &quot;The Russians hacked the DNC&quot;</p>

<p>Once this was proved completely false,
 that first off they weren&#39;t &quot;hacked&quot; and second their was no connection between Seth and Russia</p>

<p>Once their allegations were proven false they try and flip the narrative to </p>

<p>&quot;well uh yeah I mean we werent actually hacked, and we never had evidence Russia was involved, BUT THAT DOESNT MEAN SETH WASNT WORKING FOR RUSSIA EVEN THOUGH NOTHING ABOUT HIS SITUATION POINTS TO THAT NOW PROVE ME WRONG&quot;</p>

<p>Who knows if Seth was working for Russia (let’s be honest, probably not), but there’s actually no evidence that he was the leaker aside from the word of Kim Dotcom and reddit detectives who found an account with the word panda in it’s name.</p>

<p>But regardless of all that, we do know what Russia was doing during the election, because there’s plenty of evidence of this. It’s entirely possible that Seth was exposed to some of the propaganda they were spreading.</p>

<p>And hey, maybe that was just the very true accusations against Hillary, but maybe that exposure also includes false stories and other propaganda pushed by Russia.</p>

<p>Did you not pay attention to vault 7? The CIAs tools which got leaked into the wild allow for undetectable alterations to digital forensics meaning its a useless piece of &quot;evidence&quot; </p>

<p>In fact it even makes it less likely Russia was involved as that would mean Russias government sanctioned/funded hackers were so fucking incompetent they couldn&#39;t cover their tracks or forge the forensics to deflect blame, if incompetent hackers could bring the US to its knees that is our governments fault it is their duty to reasonably protect us from outside incursions, other countries should be expected to poke and prod us and if we are so unprepared we need to fix our issues not sit around crying that another kid pushed us on the play ground</p>

<p>Do you not see that you are looking for and twisting information to fit the narrative that is beijng fed to the world through the MSM instead of altering your opinion with facts you embrace anything that supports the Russia narrative and anything that doesnt you disregard</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If Russia put a puppet into the highest seat of power in the USA, and there is so much evidence that this story can be ran on repeat on all US news channels, publicly vouched for by talk show hosts and celebrities, and be obvious to random redditors. ( all of which are hallmarks of a controlled narrative BTW)</p>

<p>What does it say about our national security that he is still in office making world-altering decisions? Yeah they say he&#39;ll be taken down any day now but they have been saying that for over a year now with nothing to show for it other than taking down his associates with literally any bit of dirt they can possibly dig up which is all generally unrelated to Russia or not evidence of collusion.</p>

<p>Honestly we need to be friends with Russia by whatever means necessary if you didn&#39;t see Putins last speech they are the 2nd or 3rd most powerful country on earth and this bullshit warmongering against them is nothing more than theatre that will lead to WW3 or deplete the national budget</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I dont know to be honest, I like what Fox says sometimes but they also package in a large amount of crap and as i said MSM is not to be trusted so that list should include Fox, the difference is that Foxs stuff alot of times is fairly logical and a conspiratorial individual can find a lot of corroborating evidence for the stuff they say on conspiracy forums BUT again I figure that their tactic is to put out a neutured truth so that every individual that doesnt buy the narrative doesnt instantly go alone to find the truth for themselves but gets an approved truth from a controlled source</p>

<p>Liberal Media is usually factually/statistically false but focused more on the illogical emotional side that &quot;sounds&quot; appealing on the surface and makes people have warm-fuzzy feelings for helping out their fellow man or makes people angry at &quot;oppressors&quot; </p>

<p>Immigration for example 100% based on illogical emotion, &quot;yay lets save the suffering third worlders&quot; there are billions living in squalor and by taking in 1% of those many previously great European countries are going to complete shit with Rape in the streets and perpetrators getting off scott free due to &quot;cultural differences&quot; not to mention irreparable damage to their national culture/heritage</p>

<p>Basically, you arent making the suffering of third worlders better you are just making 1st world countries worse.</p>

<p>Yet many liberals support open borders to the worst most low IQ countries in the world.(coincidentally immigrants are like 90% liberal)</p>

<p>Another issue, gun control, on the surface it sounds so nice to take away tools of violence but then you realize they just turn every incident into a nationwide spectacle and forget to mention that in terms of population the US is actually pretty good about gun deaths, and the areas contributing most to US gun deaths have the strictest regulations.</p>

So when people say we shouldn&#39;t get behind a conspiracy theory that CNN talks about, it&#39;s not because it&#39;s the MSM. It&#39;s because is liberal MSM.</p>

<p>He makes a strong case for something to be a conspiracy theory in the cultural sense it needs to be against the official narrative.  In other words, what gives is the same thing of why, the claims that Saddam and Al-Qaeda cooperating, or that 19 hijackers crashed into 2 skyscrapers and brought down 3 are ignored, they are PR campaigns. </p>

<p>This sub generally doesn&#39;t need &quot;solid&quot; evidence to explore a potential conspiracy, though, just enough to prompt investigation.  Like, if the victim of a shooting massacre has a weird facial expression for two seconds there&#39;ll be a five front-page posts within 20 minutes.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I dont know to be honest, I like what Fox says sometimes but they also package in a large amount of crap and as i said MSM is not to be trusted so that list should include Fox, the difference is that Foxs stuff alot of times is fairly logical and a conspiratorial individual can find a lot of corroborating evidence for the stuff they say on conspiracy forums BUT again I figure that their tactic is to put out a neutured truth so that every individual that doesnt buy the narrative doesnt instantly go alone to find the truth for themselves but gets an approved truth from a controlled source</p>

<p>Liberal Media is usually factually/statistically false but focused more on the illogical emotional side that &quot;sounds&quot; appealing on the surface and makes people have warm-fuzzy feelings for helping out their fellow man or makes people angry at &quot;oppressors&quot; </p>
