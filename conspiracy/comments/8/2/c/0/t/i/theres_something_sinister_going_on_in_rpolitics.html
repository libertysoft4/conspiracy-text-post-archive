        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Now I know these are divisive political times. Tension is high, and acceptance of nuance is low.  I don&#39;t know where else to discuss this.</p>

<p>The idea that Russians are utilizing social media to drive a wedge through are society seems all but confirmed. Just people only suspect it from the Right. Which I get, the last year has featured a front-row seat to such allegations.</p>

<p>But it just makes sense to seek to divide from both sides.</p>

<p>On the front page of <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a> right now are 2 posts that are almost exactly the same. Both reached the top of <a href="/r/all">/r/all</a> in under an hour from each post, and they were posted 3 hours apart.</p>

<p>The &quot;Reddit users demand ban&quot; and &quot;Reddit users rise up&quot; posts. There&#39;s others that contain some weird stuff but these are the freakiest.</p>

<p>The top comments in these threads are almost uniformly by people with either 1 year of posting history or less than a month of posting history. Looking at their history reveals that every comment is in some way divisive, or aggressive. </p>

<p>I could post some usernames but idk how the mods here like that, and you can just go see for yourself.</p>

<p>I think we&#39;re fucking watching Russians hack the public consciousness right now. And I know that sounds like some tinfoil hat shit.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is true and very wise. I dislike name calling and I find insults to be disingenuous and prohibitive to constructive discussion. Unfortunately, hate speech is still free speech (except for protected classes/threats of violence). I suppose my point was that you&#39;ll find that type of thing everywhere on the Internet. What we can do as individuals is promote kindness, not stifle discussion. </p>
