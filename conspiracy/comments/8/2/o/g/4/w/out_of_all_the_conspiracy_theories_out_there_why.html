<p>Why do people get so hostile when it comes to this topic? I think it’s because the indoctrination of space and planets etc is so strong and thorough. There’s books, movies, pictures and any other source of media and the idea of it all being fake just seems overwhelming. </p>

<p>Consider this though, since you were a child, do you not remember being taught the globe? Why such a strong effort to teach this from birth?</p>

<p>I’d love to hear your thoughts. </p>

<p>“If you took a straight-lined flight from Alaska to Florida, you would find yourself far away from your goal because of the deflected wind. If you look at flight paths that airplanes take, they all have an arch to them. This is because while in the air the Earth is still rotating and the “final destination” rotates with it. Airlines are constantly adjusting to the rotation, while also using the Jet Stream to save fuel.[7][8][9]”</p>

You might say, &quot;Oh, but that&#39;s all just made up to trick you.&quot; But I&#39;ll put it like this: I think we can both agree that a metre is a metre. And we can both agree that a second is a second. So with basic high school physics we can calculate a velocity in m/s, and we can both agree on it being accurate. Right? Well the physics that prove what we know about the earth and space are just as concrete as the physics that calculate velocity. Just because the average person can&#39;t understand this level of physics doesn&#39;t mean it isn&#39;t concrete. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Wrong. Prior to jumping or throwing the ball in the air, you are also moving at the same speed as the ground immediately below you.  When you jump, your momentum doesn’t just disappear, you continue moving the same direction at (very nearly) the same speed while you are in the air (which, absent a strong, clearly observable, wind) is also moving at the same speed in the same direction, maintaining a uniform speed and rotation to the whole system. </p>

Not sure what happened but a ton of people on this sub now are opposite of the old culture. The new culture downvotes and hates on topics they don&#39;t agree with.

I don&#39;t sub to things I won&#39;t talk about or have interest in so why sub here just to hate?

    <div class="md"><p>My issue is that FE believers always try to have “an open discussion” about their theory but then try to put the onus on being proven wrong.  FE believers are saying that what we believe to be true, the Earth is spherical, but then offer no proof to the contrary.  FE believers should be the ones supplying proof that the Earth is flat. And most of the discussions with flat earthers become devolved into some sort of blind eye being turned to basic science that proves the Earth is a globe as we’ve all been taught.  The discussions are always brought up and then the same people who start the conversation will close off any actual open discussions with simple “nope. I don’t believe that. You’re wrong.”  without ever backing up claims.  There is more than enough proof to show that the Earth is a sphere. Where is the evidence that it is flat? YouTube videos?  This is why FE gets so much backlash.  It’s more the people than the theory.  Offer evidence, be open minded like you’d like the people to be that you’re trying to convince, and maybe people would at least be willing to investigate on their own.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>never do they face the backlash of flat earth. Why is that?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Simple answer... because any time someone actually explains the evidence for a spherical earth, the flat earth believers simply deny it.</p>

<p>For example, they say &quot;where are the photos showing a spherical earth?&quot; When someone shows them the photos taken by NASA and other space agencies, the flat earthers simply say &quot;Oh, they&#39;re fake, NASA lies, its all bullshit&quot;.</p>

<p>No evidence, not even an argument as to why the evidence is fake, just simple denial.</p>

<p>You can show them the maths. You can show them photos of ships disappearing over the horizon from the bottom up. You can present all the evidence in the world, and all you get is denial and rejection of basic scientific facts.</p>

<p>Most of these idiots couldn&#39;t even give you and correct explanation of &quot;perspective&quot; or the &quot;vanishing point&quot;, but will at various times claim it is the reason we can&#39;t see past the horizon, but that it doesn&#39;t exist when used to explain crepuscular rays...</p>

<p>Rational people end up presenting the same <em>unrefuted</em> evidence over and over again while flat earth retard after flat earth retard simply denies it exists while demanding to see it.</p>

<p>It gets boring and annoying, which is why the rational people react so strongly to yet another flat earth retard asking the same questions and rejecting the same expplanations.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>How do you explain the Great Year on a flat earth? The cycle of procession? What mechanism could fake such a complicated and long process (25,800 years)? </p>

<blockquote>
<p>The term Great Year has a variety of related meanings. It is defined by NASA as &quot;The period of one complete cycle of the equinoxes around the ecliptic, about 25,800 years ... also known as [a] Platonic Year.&quot;[1] One complete cycle of the equinoxes here means one complete cycle of axial precession.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Ancient civilizations including the Sumerians, the Egyptians, the Olmecs, the Mayans, the Indians (Indus), and the Chinese were all aware of this cycle over 4,000 years ago. It was information passed on to them from a previous civilization.</p>

<p>Sadly this is not an example of deception, rather a simple mistake. Seriously, you can prove the earth is spherical with math that existed thousands of years ago. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That’s where your wrong. Those professions often require physics that are effected by the shape of the earth; for example, pilots monitoring the Coriolis Effect. </p>

<p>“If you took a straight-lined flight from Alaska to Florida, you would find yourself far away from your goal because of the deflected wind. If you look at flight paths that airplanes take, they all have an arch to them. This is because while in the air the Earth is still rotating and the “final destination” rotates with it. Airlines are constantly adjusting to the rotation, while also using the Jet Stream to save fuel.[7][8][9]”</p>
