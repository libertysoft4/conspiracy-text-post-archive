<p>“Hi John - I just wanted to thank you again for your hospitality last night. You were so kind to open your home to us, and the food was as fantastic as promised (everyone at the White House raves about your dinners). I really appreciated the opportunity to connect with a number of folks from Team Clinton. The evening was a great way to kick off this crazy adventure. Thank you, and I hope we&#39;ll cross paths again soon. Best, Colleen Colleen McCain Nelson The Wall Street Journal”</p>

<p><em>No wonder the mainstream media shilled so hard for Hillary during the 2016 election cycle.</em></p>

<p><em>The first link is the list of media personalities who went to the &quot;off the record&quot; private party in the personal home of John Podesta. Includes many corrupt, in-the-tank-for-Hillary journalists like John Heillman, Mark Halperin, Maggie Haberman (colluding in other emails with the Hillary campaign) and many others (Diane Sawyer, George Stephanopoulos, Mika Brzezinski, and so many more).</em></p>

<p><em>The largest amount of invitees who said yes to the private party are from the New York Times, Bloomberg, MSNBC, and CNN. Seems to nicely reflect the level of corruption and pro-Hillary bias. This is April 2015 so they were influencing journalists for a long time and their investment has clearly paid off.</em></p>

<p>A lawsuit filed Tuesday lays out a tale of Trump allies, the White House and Fox News Channel conspiring to push a false story about Democratic leaks and an unsolved killing in order to distract attention from the Russia investigation that has been swirling around the president.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Let’s do.  </p>

<hr/>

<p><strong>The Clinton Foundation</strong>  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>The Hill reported on Thursday that the FBI has launched a new investigation into the Clinton Foundation which focuses on whether the Clinton’s engaged in any pay-to-play politics or other illegal activities during Clinton’s time as Secretary of State in the Obama administration.</p>
</blockquote>

<hr/>

<p><strong>Clinton’s Use Of A Private Email Server</strong>  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>On Thursday, The Hill published a report from John Solomon which featured former FBI director James Comey’s original draft on the investigation into Clinton’s use of a private email server. The draft showed that the term “gross negligence” was used multiple times and specifically said that there was evidence to conclude that Clinton committed a felony. Anti-Trump FBI agent Peter Strzok, who texted about having an “insurance policy” against Trump’s election, softened the language in Comey’s draft so Clinton could avoid possible criminal charges.  </p>

<p>A senior law enforcement official told Solomon that the DOJ “was exploring whether any issues from that probe should be re-opened but cautioned the effort was not at the stage of a full investigation.”  </p>
</blockquote>

<hr/>

<p><strong>Uranium One</strong>  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered federal prosecutors at the DOJ in December to begin interviewing FBI agents about the evidence they collected during a criminal investigation into the controversial Uranium One deal, which directly involved the Clintons.  </p>

<p>There are multiple aspects at play in this investigation, from the Obama administration threatening a witness to stay quiet because they did not want him testifying to Congress because it would impact the 2016 presidential election, to the Russian officials who were engaged in bribery, kickbacks, extortion, and money laundering directly connected to the Uranium One deal.   </p>
</blockquote>

<hr/>

<p><strong>The Obama Administration Ending Investigations Into Hezbollah</strong>  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>In December, Politico published a bombshell report about how the Obama administration ended a massive federal investigation, dubbed “Project Cassandra,” into the Iranian-backed terrorist organization Hezbollah. The Obama administration’s decision to sabotage the investigation so it could secure the Iran nuclear deal allowed Hezbollah to traffic hundreds of millions of dollars worth of cocaine into the United States and allowed them to operate “the largest material support scheme for terrorism operations the world had ever seen.”    </p>

<p>A little over a week after the report came out, congressional leaders announced that they were launching an investigation into the Obama administration’s efforts to end the Hezbollah investigation. <strong>This could include investigating Clinton because she was Obama’s Secretary of State from 2009 to 2013 and the State Department was involved in the Obama administration’s efforts to end the investigation, according to the report.</strong> Politico reported, “Further complicating the picture was the role of the State Department, which often wanted to quash both law-enforcement actions and covert operations due to the political backlash they created.”    </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Of course they wanted him to win.  Ratings don’t suddenly become meaningless after the election.  MSM continues to benefit from ratings boosts from Trump’s entertainment.  Don’t fool yourself, the industry with the greatest benefit to a Trump presidency is media.  NYT and WSJ are having their best years in the digital era, they needed Trump.  Of course they’re on his side.  They continue to donate to his campaign for the next three years.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Of course it does.  The media clearly benefits more from a Clinton presidency than a Trump presidency.  A Trump presidency had the prospect of higher ratings, lower corporate taxes and looser regulations than a Clinton presidency.  It clearly is more profitable to have Trump in the White House.  Their plan was to jam the airwaves with Trump 24/7 and it worked.  The notion of “bad press” is just optics.  Bad press let’s Trump play the victim (even though he gets $5b with of free airtime) and he is given a massive microphone to spread his “outsider” message.  Everything else is optics.  </p>
