<p>When you tax consumption instead of production, it is fairer for everyone. The rich end up paying a whole lot more than what they do now, and the poor actually contribute to the system. (Over 50% do not pay any federal income tax currently) </p>

<p>This is completely untrue. The wealthy invest much more than they spend, while lower classes live paycheck to paycheck and are forced to spend their income on taxable expenses, which would go up by a huge margin</p>

</blockquote>

<p>True there hasn&#39;t been much outcry against state sales tax that I know of, but it is generally a small tax. In my state there has recently been a very large movement to get rid of property taxes, which are another regressive tax of a similar nature</p>

<p>That&#39;s fine, but it&#39;s still going to place a higher burden on the lower classes. If a family who makes 50k and buys a ps4 it doesn&#39;t mean a family who makes 1mil is going to buy the equivalent of 20 ps4s. Rich people simply don&#39;t buy as much to stimulate the economy proportional to their income</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Rich people do tend to spend their money though. More expensive cars, bigger houses, bigger televisions, etc. </p>

<p>Heck, 50&quot; 4k TV&#39;s can be found for less than $400 now, which enables those with less money to obtain one. You want a 55&quot; OLED TV though and you are looking at $2,000+. </p>

<p>It certainly will place A burden on the lower classes. I wouldn&#39;t say higher because right now the lower classes have no federal income tax burden. </p>

<p>If that means that they have to save a little longer for a PS4 or go without, then I&#39;m ok with that. I&#39;m tired of people thinking that wealth is a &quot;right&quot; when in fact it isn&#39;t. &quot;Pursuit of Happiness&quot; is not the same as &quot;I get everything I want because it makes me happy.&quot; </p>

<p>I grew up poor, the oldest of 6 kids. Most of my clothes were hand me downs from my uncles. My father was the only bread winner in the family. I got a toy on my birthday and a toy on Christmas. My parents would save a little each month, and they had a budget of $20 for each kid&#39;s birthday gift and $100 for each kid&#39;s Christmas gifts. </p>

<p>We didn&#39;t have video game systems, big screens, etc, and if there was anything we wanted we had to come up with the money ourselves. I remember a neighbor needed her entire perimeter fence painted, and it took me 3 weeks to do it, working a few hours a day. I was paid $20 for the entire job. </p>

<p>Never did my parents once ask for assistance. If we were low on cash, well we broke out some food storage and had barley soup for a few days. </p>

<p>It never crossed my family&#39;s mind that anyone owed us a damn thing. </p>

<p>I&#39;ve gotten to where I am now because I worked my ass off. I wanted to go to college, and instead of getting massive student loan debt, I worked my ass off. If I didn&#39;t have enough money for a class, I waited until next semester. Did it drag college out a bit? Absolutely, but at least I don&#39;t have all of that debt. </p>

<p>I&#39;m not rich by any means, though I would consider myself upper-middle class for the area of the country in which I live. My point is this: If I can do it, anybody can. People need to remember that the country is about EQUAL OPPORTUNITY, not EQUAL OUTCOME. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>What is your response to the fact that those taxes disproportionately impact the lower/middle classes? </p>

<p>There is a reason we are taxed on both income and spending, eliminating taxes on the majority of the upper-classes and corporations income would result in a much higher sales tax in order to bring in income to balance the budget. This tax makes it much more difficult for the lower/middle class to purchase day to day items and services</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>You don’t show why a flat tax is necessary  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>A flat tax is necessary because there is actually no other form of representative taxation that is ethical. You and I should pay the same portion of what we&#39;re worth for protection by the government. That is the essence of taxation. Any divergences from that part &quot;same portion&quot; is fundamental discrimination. Everyone is so quick to be a proponent for taxing the rich heavier than the poor, but that is actually wrong. Seriously, there&#39;s no way around it. Progressive and regressive taxes are seriously wrong if you actually believe in personal freedom of enterprise in the US. Not everything is concrete though, there are outliers such as corrupt business owners who abuse workers, and disabled workers who cannot support themselves with a job, but there is government intervention for that. Let me pose this simple question and scenario:  </p>

<p>You make 500k a year. You&#39;re in the highest tax bracket, meaning you get taxed a whopping 39.6% of your gross income. You are a brain surgeon who does not make mistakes, with 100k left in student loans and a PhD to back it up. A cashier at Burger King working full time might be taxed 15% of their income($9,325+). Think about your qualifications, your skills, your daily hard work, and your schooling with debt compared with that of a entry level worker. How do you justify to <strong>yourself</strong>, not the cashier, that you get taxed nearly triple in proportion with him? It&#39;s very easy to say that a lower income person should be taxed less because they already make less, but that is completely irrational and against the foundations of equal capitalism and democracy. Given that in the absence of corruption as prevented by the government, a person&#39;s wealth is <strong>directly</strong> related to the advances that a person has made in their experience or education. I do not believe a rational person who is actually making a high income would be able to justify it. It&#39;s because it&#39;s unjustifiable. </p>

Unless you value unfair and discriminatory taxation, there is no other argument than that everyone should be taxed equally. As I said, there are outliers, like the corrupt.

<p>Of course we have a huge corruption problem in our domestic markets, and we also have huge monopoly problems. Those problems along with the support of the impoverished are the only purposes of our government in the market. My point is that all of that aside, there is no way in hell it makes sense to tax the rich more. They fucking earned it. There is literally nothing else to say other than they deserve to have the same proportion of disposable income. There are other ways for the government to make money than to unfairly scalp the rich because they can balance the checkbooks easier.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I mean, basically it comes down to the premise of &quot;to each according to his needs.&quot; </p>

<p>There&#39;s a baseline standard of living that&#39;s not being met for millions of people in the US and the world due to being poor, and there&#39;s a handful of people who have more money than they&#39;ll ever need in one lifetime.  It&#39;s unethical to let people hoard wealth when so much preventable suffering is happening in the world due to poverty.  Progressive taxation allows for a redistribution of wealth to help those who need it most.  </p>

<p>Asking poor people who are less able or unable to afford taxes to pay the same rate as rich people who are more able to do so seems backwards to me.  You&#39;re exacerbating the situation for an already vulnerable section of the population by asking them to pay the same rate as those who are invulnerable (in terms of wealth).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I hope you understand a flat tax can be implemented at less than 15% for everyone, equally. Welfare is the problem, and promoting an actual crime like a progressive tax is the wrong way to solve the problem you think we have.  Welfare is not a support system to supplement the income of the poverty, it&#39;s a restriction system that only helps people when they literally act as dead meat in the market (consuming with gov&#39;t money instead of creating capital themselves). Abolish welfare, institute &lt;15% unified income tax, reduce sales tax but implement it in all states in a smaller amount, and you can then actually give out income subsidies. Income subsidies are negative income taxes, and the government would be able to offer it with the funds from the welfare system. The government would offer 50% of the poverty rate in the US to every taxable head, as a subsidy, to replace welfare. There are no employment restrictions in this method. When you make more money, you get a smaller portion of the income subsidy, but for every 1$ you earn in wages you would lose less than 1$ in the subsidy(which is an incentive to not be unemployed).   </p>

<p>I really hope that makes even a shred of sense because you are really missing the point I&#39;m trying to make about the tax. It&#39;s completely not about whether the rich <em>can</em> pay the tax, it&#39;s &quot;is the tax fair&quot;. It is not fair. That is a fact. You seem to be familiar with Marx so I&#39;ll also make the point that there are much better ways to decrease &quot;alienated workers&quot;, that don&#39;t conflict with the laws of equal liberty most people believe in. My entire first paragraph is an example of a better way. </p>

</blockquote>

<p>You keep stating that&#39;s it&#39;s unfair to make the rich pay a higher rate because it&#39;s unequal treatment.  That&#39;s just one way to frame it.</p>

<p>Another way to frame is in terms of excess income (i.e. income remaining after necessities).  You could say that poor people only have &lt;10% excess income before taxes and rich people have &gt;90% excess income before taxes.  Framing it this way, it seems unfair to make poor people pay the same rate when their excess income can&#39;t even cover the 15% rate you propose.  You&#39;re making poor people pay a greater share of their excess income.  </p>

<p>Since these are both valid ways to frame the situation, the question now becomes a matter of what&#39;s more unfair:</p>

<p>1) Making rich people pay a higher tax rate, or</p>

<p>2) Making poor people pay a greater share of their excess income</p>

<p>Scenario 1 is asking more of people who are able to sacrifice more, whereas scenario 2 is asking more of people who are less able to sacrifice more.  Both scenarios are asking for more, but asking for more from the poor seems less fair to me.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>What is your response to the fact that the current income tax system in our country is absurdly progressive and disproportionately impacts the upper/rich classes?  </p>

<p>There are two sides to every coin. The terrible part is we are stuck in a system that abuses both ends of the income spectrum and funnels money to the government. The solution, in my opinion, is a complete abandoning of the current welfare system, drop the progressive income tax in favor of a 14-16% flat tax, and institute a smaller sales tax in place of the high sales taxes on common goods. With Welfare gone and their employment-restrictions for support gone, a yearly income subsidy can then be added. The amount would depend on half of the poverty wage, with actual incentives, not restrictions on hours or pay like welfare, to stay employed. As your income rises, your subsidy lessens. The rich would get little to nothing yearly and the poor would get the max amount.   </p>

<p>This is a really quick explanation of what I believe but if you&#39;re interested on the actual viability of a system like this in the US then check out <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtpgkX588nM">this</a> video.</p>

<p>The net worth of the richest Americans have risen drastically compared to the rest of America, so it&#39;s rather puzzling to see you trying to make the upper class into the victims as opposed to the winners in this economy. </p>

<p>The poorest Americans have little to contribute and don&#39;t have the means of lowering their effective tax rates like top earners tend to do. </p>

Any tax that takes money away disproportionately is ridiculous. Would you support a Caucasian tax so that white people have to pay more? No, that&#39;s inherent racism, and the same concept applies to making the rich pay more. It&#39;s systematic discrimination based on income.

<p>You want to talk about &quot;fairness&quot; as the upper class gains more material wealth with a corresponding tighter grip on our republic&#39;s governing power?</p>

<p>The rich aren&#39;t the ones who struggle with paying mortgages, or food, or getting their teeth fixed or getting cancer treatment, or paying for college, so quit your crocodile tears. It&#39;s amazing how peoople like you always make the upper class into the heroes while you sneer at the poor as if they&#39;re the villains in this story. </p>

<p>It isn&#39;t a hard concept: the rich can contribute more to society. But not only that, but many of these rich people exploit the workers in this country, so why should these same workers pay the tax rates as their exploiters? Why should the Waltons, who have a greater net worth than the bottom 40% of this nation, get taxed at the same rate? </p>

<p>America is supposed to be a republic, not a monarchy with concentrated wealth and power. </p>

<p>I would completely disagree with you. The rich are taxed at a higher rate, but the burden on them is far less due to how much money they have or make. A middle or lower class person is far more impacted losing 15-25% of their salary to taxes than a millionaire is at losing 40%, especially since that tax rate only applies to any income they make over 470k. We need more/better tax brackets, but it is false to pretend like the rich are actually impacted more by our tax system than the middle class is.</p>

<p>As for the rest of your post, I have generally leaned libertarian  in my life and I&#39;m familiar with negative income taxes. The fair tax act failed to satisfy me since the prebate was small and I am opposed to the flat tax being a sales tax, but I think there is potential in the idea if it were to have a flat income tax that properly taxed investments and capital gains, and that the corporate rate were separate and higher</p>

    <div class="md"><p>By the way, I was not referring to Paul&#39;s plan, but Friedman&#39;s and others much earlier. There of course is a long way to go in determining the optimal rates and amounts of the plan, but the system is already fairer in practice than income taxation. My point is not about whether the extra burden is feasibly paid by a rich person. My point is also not about whether a poor person can handle their tax burden when it is higher. My point is that taxation should be fair, and a flat tax already proportionally takes your money away. The rich pay abundantly more in taxes (except under our current system with loopholes), but the poor still pay 10-15% too. Under the ~15% flat tax, nearly everyone&#39;s rate would go down, except for the bottom 9k of earners (part-time). The poor would not be taxed heavier in any other capacity other than the &lt;$9,325 bracket, because it would increase from 10% to 15%. All else stays the same, except the rich gets taxed 25% less. You may think that this 25% would go into their pockets but that is not true. More than 20% of that extra cash would go directly back into investment. Can you imagine what a 20% increase in the velocity of money would do to the GDP? The only time the rich are bad is when they got there through illegitimate means or they are corrupt. All other rich people bolster the economy, innovate, and create. Not one rich person just amasses wealth and sits on it, unless they won it in a lottery. Why should the working poor get a income tax subsidy(essentially what it is compared with the rich&#39;s taxes) with no discernable skills, no higher education, no motivation. They need to toughen up. Get the fucking skills and put yourself in the damn 1%. There is nothing stopping you in 2018 from doing that.  </p>

<p>Low taxes at low incomes is one of the biggest incentives you can give to stay in poverty.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t see how bankrupting farmers makes that goal more likely. Regardless. The main point here is that there will be retaliatory tariffs that affect millions of american jobs. The idea that this is only about the us domestic market is a dangerous oversimplification. The countries that are going to be worst affected by this are Canada and mexico. I don&#39;t see how damaging the country&#39;s closest allies is a smart move. Especially when it is a move that forces the rest of the world to work against the interests of the us. </p>

<p>Taxing commodities like steel and aluminum actually helps foreign products.  For instance, if you impose a steel tariff, suddenly auto manufacturers in the US have increased input costs than auto manufacturers abroad, meaning they have to price their cars higher.  That makes foreign cars more competitive and better able to undercut US auto manufacturers.</p>

<p>We shouldn&#39;t need those with income taxes either.  They exits because (1) the tax preparation lobby repeatedly kills efforts that would have the IRS do the calculations automatically for the vast majority of Americans with simple returns, like many western countries already do, and (2) Congress loves to give handouts to favored businesses or try to effect substantive policy through tax preferences, complicating everything.</p>

<p>The reasoning behind this is actually that having an “opt-in” income tax system forces people to calculate their own tax, thus insuring they’re liable for the minimum amount allowed, whereas a system like you’re describing would have the government send you a bill and you defend your position for owing less tax. It’s both less efficient, from a practical stanfpoint, to do it that way and would leave many Americans in a position where they simply pay their income tax bill, right or wrong, without ever actually checking it. Forcing people to calculate it themselves is for their own good. </p>

<p>Roosevelt left office in 1909. He had selected Taft, his Secretary of War, to succeed him as presidential candidate and Taft easily won the 1908 presidential election. Roosevelt became disappointed by Taft&#39;s increasingly conservative policies... They became openly hostile and Roosevelt decided to seek the presidency. Roosevelt entered the campaign late as Taft was already being challenged by progressive leader Senator Robert La Follette of Wisconsin. Most of La Follette&#39;s supporters switched to Roosevelt, leaving the Wisconsin Senator embittered. Nine of the states where progressive elements were strongest had set up preference primaries, which Roosevelt won, but Taft had worked far harder than Roosevelt to control the Republican Party&#39;s organizational operations and the mechanism for choosing its presidential nominee, the 1912 Republican National Convention. For example, he bought up the votes of delegates from the southern states, copying the technique Roosevelt himself used in 1904. The Republican National Convention rejected Roosevelt&#39;s protests. Roosevelt and his supporters walked out and the convention re-nominated Taft. The next day, Roosevelt supporters met to form a new political party of their own.</p>

America is one of the biggest consumer driven country in the world and tax hike on import won&#39;t stop them from doing business  here at all they make to much money from our consumer driven scociaty.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>They weren&#39;t taxing &quot;us,&quot; unless by &quot;us&quot; you mean the tiny percentage of Americans who controlled almost all the wealth in 1913. At that time the average factory worker worked over 55 hours a week was paid crap, and almost all the wealth was being taken in by the few at the very tippy top. There&#39;s a reason that only about 15% of Americans paid income taxes at that time, they weren&#39;t taxing the average worker, just trying to correct the gross collection of wealth at the top that was created by the gilded age. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I am specifically referring to China, as they fund the warlords in Africa and have colonized it for the purpose of extracting conflict minerals to use in manufactured goods that retarded westerners go out and buy(iPhones and assorted Foxconn trash like that). They give the warlords weapons and in return they get slave mined resources, including gold, which China has been stockpiling over 90% of the annual production of for about a decade.</p>

<p>In case you havent been paying attention to whats been going on in places like Sudan for decades either, slavery is thriving in Africa, thanks in large part to China. Slave labour also thrives in shitholes like China and N Korea. You may not realize just how many slaves there currently are throughout the world. Perhaps you should google up the statistics before you go buy your next piece of Made in China garbage.</p>
