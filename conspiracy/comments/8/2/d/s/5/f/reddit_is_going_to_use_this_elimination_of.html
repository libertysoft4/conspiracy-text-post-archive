    <div class="md"><p>No one said their system is infallible and will immediately catch all the accounts.  You start with the worst offenders, then work you way down to less obvious accounts.</p>

<p>Not that I don&#39;t believe you - lots of people are using robot automation for these purposes - but your theory would be alot more solid if you specifically cited users who violate this.  </p>

<p>That is why so many of the T_D bots got banned, because people took the time to document their automation beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>

<p>Weve gotten hundreds of shareblue bots banned.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>actually it was supposed to be a commentary on post war england. the original title was 1948. orwell&#39;s publisher made him change it.</p>

<p>people forget that orwell was an informant. he spied on his fellow writers and reported them to britain&#39;s version of HUAC. he knew what he was talking about...firsthand...</p>

<p>in one sense, it is good that it was shifted to the future, people are more receptive to warnings, than admonitions, but it also meant that people have kidded themselves into thinking 1984 was always on the horizen, when it was here all along, for going on 70 years. the lunancy of people living through HUAC and the red scare and not realizing 1984 was already real. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The first amendment isn&#39;t nonsense. Without the US tax payers money building the infrastructure for the Internet to exist in the first place these &quot;public forums&quot; wouldn&#39;t exist. If you&#39;re piggybacking off of the US government you should be bound to its laws like every other entity. If bakers have to cook cakes for whiney gays then reddit should have to put up with stupid Trump supporters. How would you feel if I banned all your stupid opinions on every platform. How would you feel if you couldn&#39;t speak your mind on twitter,facebook,reddit,youtube, etc? How would you feel If you couldn&#39;t even host your own website to display your opinions without a bunch of neurotic fucks crying until you get shut down. This  shut down   of public discourse is what leads to divides which end in violence. People you can&#39;t talk to are enemies. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>We will see. There is currently a case involving twitter and that Amren guy that looks promising. It&#39;s in my opinion that public forums such as these should have to adhere to our constitutional rights. As for Russian bots that&#39;s different.

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not disagreeing with your point about liberals freaking out if it it was on the other foot, but I do disagree that you believe they don&#39;t have a right to censor their content. It&#39;s a private forum, and freedom of speech protects you from prosecution from the government, not from being censored on a private companies website. I think you have a very broad interpretation of the first amendment, and it&#39;s not an uncommon interpretation either.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>In its current status it might be true. Things can change especially when it comes to interpretation of law and how it is worded. In the past we have had to pass laws to regulate monopolies in order to create a fairer market. When our marketplace of ideas and public discourse gets put into the hands of a nepotistic bunch whom seek to monopolize it for their narrow range of political interests I don&#39;t see why there couldn&#39;t be changes made.  Years ago sexual orientation might not have been protected. Today it is. Today free speech on Internet might not be protected but with a world where public life is increasingly being woven with the Internet I think things may change. Or at least be spoken about to see where we are on the issue. </p>

<p>It isn&#39;t a violation of free speech to keep certain rhetoric out of your community, as much as you may think it is wrong, it doesn&#39;t make a first amendment violation.

<p>And discussion forum website formats are not the only form of website allowed on the Internet.

<p>Reddit isn&#39;t actually doing anything wrong in terms of the law.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The law isn&#39;t the only...or even the primary... basis for evaluating wrongdoing.  Censorship is morally wrong regardless of whether it is done by a government or a non-government entity because it violates a fundamental human right of free speech.  Owning a website doesn&#39;t miraculously transform that wrong into right.  At the core of the problem is deception.  They infer that anyone is free to set up an account and express their views and no mention is made at the time of account creation that the website owners intend to prohibit specific viewpoints.  Thus, when a person takes time to establish an account after having been mislead that their free expression would be allowed, when that turns out to not be true, then the website has defrauded them of the time which that user invested in establishing the account, reading, and replying. In short, since the website&#39;s ad revenue is based upon viewership, they are falsely luring in people to increase their ad revenues, but doing so with the intention of actually not letting the user speak freely.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know what else you need bub, it literally says it right there, any reason we choose, says they can remove anything for any reason. I don&#39;t care how ambiguous or unfair you think that part of the ToS is, the point is they can remove your post for whatever reason they want, and they never mislead you about that fact. You have no argument here. I am not going to sit here and argue about the semantics of their ToS, if you feel you cannot adhere to them or come to terms with them, then you should not use Reddit (it also says that in the ToS, which I suspect you did not read until now)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I personally don&#39;t find it ambiguous at all; I stated that you may find the post ambiguous or unfair. It states that they can remove your post for any reason, what is misleading about that? </p>

<p>&quot;muh internet&quot; lol, do you seriously think that solely you own the internet. Our tax dollars, not just your tax dollars funded it, so that makes it <em>our</em> internet.. which you probably wont like to hear since that&#39;s a pretty socialist idea. Sharing something as a public service that all of our tax dollars funded. </p>

<p>Seriously, the fact that you think it is <em>your</em> internet and not <em>our</em> internet, as in <em>anyone</em> can do what they want with it, and the fact that you think a company has to bend to your will because you do not like their terms of service that <strong>you agreed to when you made your account</strong> whilst spouting I have some sort of socialist agenda that I am pushing is ironic and ridiculous to the point that I actually laughed out loud. The irony here is that, you believe I&#39;m spouting socialist nonsense, when in reality this line of thinking (that a company can do what it wants with it&#39;s services free from government regulation) is more libertarian if anything.</p>

<p>Get a grip on reality dude, I&#39;m not sure how it&#39;s undermining your free speech. A company enforcing their ToS that you agreed to is somehow undermining your free speech rights. I just have to go ahead and assume that you don&#39;t even know what the 1st amendment actually covers, so I don&#39;t think I should engage in this pointless argument anymore until you get a grip on reality and learn what it is that you are actually arguing.</p>

<p>Can you explain to me what the parallel is in 1984 to a private company banning accounts, which are used to sow confusion among the electorate? I&#39;ve recently read the book, for at least the third time, and I don&#39;t see it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So, to be clear, in 1984 they would switch who they were at war with and then they would force everyone to say that we have always been at war with them, and they would go back and edit all of the information to cleanse or add information that would support this theory.</p>

<p>So are we suggesting that Russia isn&#39;t an adversary? Or that Russia just recently became an adversary and we have gone back in time and made up the cold war and the tensions that have existed since the fall of the USSR? That&#39;s amazing because I remember my sister went to Germany and was lucky enough to be there during the fall of the Berlin wall, and was able to take some chunks off of it. Hell, my family even has some of these chunks. It&#39;s amazing how well they edited history because they even put these rocks in my parent&#39;s and sister&#39;s house. /s</p>

<p>I honestly don&#39;t see how reddit banning some russian troll accounts is anything like the &quot;we have always been at war&quot; claim from 1984.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes it does, you say you see no reason to be upset that &quot;Russian trolls&quot; are being banned, when in reality they are just a boogeyman. It was shown that they did what, buy some political ads?? Made a couple Facebook groups or something?? It was a drop in the pond.</p>

<p>Reddit has censored TD from appearing on the front page and changed vote weights, conservatives are being banned from twitter and youtube and having their videos demonetized in mass under the guise of &quot;hate speech&quot; when in reality they are just telling people the truth.</p>

However, saying I don&#39;t belong in a sub for sharing a belief counter to yours, especially in a sub about open discussion, is a bit much.</p>

<p>The propaganda issue is a rather large thing despite you wanting to believe otherwise. Yes, said trolls spread messages on both sides of our political system. You seem to want to make this a right vs left situation. It&#39;s moreover Americans vs foreign influence. Additionally, there are facilities where people make comparable salaries to what we Americans make where people create content for social media and online publications. Don&#39;t think that much resource would be wasted on something that doesn&#39;t matter.</p>

<p>So how is Google just pushing liberal news then? I can agree to censoring their results to an extent. However, why does Google still allow one to search for alt right sites and material while also supposedly censoring said material?

<p>Yes shareblue is trolls, their handbook was leaked online, I&#39;ll try to track it down. It went into detail on how to slide discussion on online forums, push their narrative and multitude of other techniques. It was rebranded after they were exposed from CTR to shareblue</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That claim on the majority being racist nazis is a bit over stretching, agreed. However, it&#39;s not entirely wrong as said group seems to favor those mentioned alt right sites. The alt sites are more a safe space for said racists.</p>

<p>I wouldn&#39;t put shareblue in the same bucket as trolly alt right sites. Said handbook you are referencing is a response to the unbalanced information situation that existed and still exists. It more or less states that shareblue will act as anti-Trump in the sense of fighting against misinformation spread by said administration. For your view, I can see how they are the enemy as you are a regular on TD. However, it&#39;s not quite as radical as what it is in response to. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>?? you realize the Flynn thing happened AFTER he was picked as NSA while Trump was Pres. Elect right? The entire deal is he didn&#39;t explain exactly what he said on a phone call to FBI agent Strzk (yes the corrupt as fuck one with texts about creating insurance policies and shit. same guy).</p>

<p>Again I ask, which one is charged with conspiring against the US? is it something new or did I miss it?</p>

<p>page and manafort I don&#39;t know much about, but wasn&#39;t Manafort a paperwork crime? like he didn&#39;t file something by a certain time?</p>

<p>So if you unknowingly hired a person that killed someone without you knowing, is it then your fault when he get&#39;s charged lol.</p>

<p>You seem to be missing my point that none of that has to do with Russian collusion and election meddling which was the entire point in the first place.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Clearly all of Flynn&#39;s sketchy doings didn&#39;t stretch before Trump picked him. Not like Obama&#39;s admin gave advice to not hire the guy as he as previously fired.</p>

<p>Page plead guilty to a count of conspiracy against the US. I believe there were some others named but that is the one that comes to mind. Same dude who has FISA surveillance renewed on him for what like 2 years before he was hired by Trump. Manafort got caught up in paperwork initially but I think he has other charges on him now.</p>

<p>In this case I&#39;m fairly certain said manager knew about his employee&#39;s skeletons but still hired him anyways.</p>

<p>Pretty sure that whole conspiracy against the US is the Russian meddling charge you keep asking for. And as I said earlier, gotta wait til the end of the investigation before claiming no charges exist. </p>

<p>I&#39;m sure Russia has internet trolls, as I&#39;m sure every other country meddles in every other country&#39;s business. Welcome to geopolitics. Russia&#39;s influence seems to be incredibly overblown. I&#39;d be incredibly surprised if China didn&#39;t have a similar influence, as well as many of our allies. Everyone has a stake in the U.S election, they&#39;d be stupid to not try and interfere. We&#39;re just using Russia as the current boogeyman as the middle east has been largely pacified and we always need an enemy.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree we always need a scapegoat, at least that&#39;s how our current America seems to be. Russia definitely fits the bill as they have been a longtime guest on the sitcom that is America. However, from what has been gathered from not just US intelligence but from the international scene, Russia has been on the cyber game hard as of late and we, as in the US, seemed to have just ignored it until it became an issue. I think our country &quot;needing&quot; another boogeyman, a trend seen coming from the right as an observation, fell into a lap of convenience.</p>

If we <em>really</em> dug, I&#39;d be surprised if there was a single major power <strong>not</strong> found to be interfering with our election. Lord knows at least Israel, China, Russia, and parts of (if not all) of the EU were. I&#39;d be incredibly surprised to find otherwise.  </p>

<p>It&#39;s beneficial for everyone else in the world to blame Russia as everyone wants to influence the U.S but no one wants to deal with a pissed off U.S.</p>

<p>The internet was fine before 2015, and it&#39;s fine right now. Glad to see you parroting every possible sharia blue talking point, though. </p>

<p>This was fun. I really enjoyed how you moved the goalposts completely away from what was being discussed. I&#39;m glad you now admit that Google has plenty of motivation to push for mass surveillance.</p>

<p>You are incredibly blinded. Democrats aren&#39;t peaceful little doves. They vote against things when it looks good for them, not out of principle (as can be seen with the Patriot act). You need to realize that <em>all</em> politicians, except for a very select few, are out for their own good. Not yours. Not mine. Daddy government will always care for itself first which is why I prefer to limit its power.</p>

<p>Check out <a href="/r/againsthatesubreddits">/r/againsthatesubreddits</a> sometime and you&#39;ll see how bad some subs can get. The sub is left leaning , meaning either there isn&#39;t left related hate at this level or there is a clear bias. It does show the bottom of the barrel though. </p>

<p>The Donald also hate the rally in Charlottesville stickied even though it was it was organized by white supremacists.

    <div class="md"><p>So what lies has the government spread about our adversarial nature with Russia? The only tie I&#39;ve seen to 1984 was the false claim that this was the &quot;we have always been at war with Russia&quot; and that doesn&#39;t change the fact that it hasn&#39;t even been 30 years since the cold war ended, it would be ridiculous to believe that they went from adversary then, to neutral with us now.</p>

<p>Yeah... Do you remember 9/11? Whatever your opinion on it being real or an inside job or whatever, politicians and citizens were united in that there needed to be a response of force. Obviously the actions GWB took were... Not good, but its unfair to say he didnt live up to his campaign promises when he had to deal with the largest attack on american soil since pearl harbor.</p>

<p>As for the rest of your comment, yeah obviously you&#39;re not going to get real substantial change from the executive branch. Real change goes through congress, who has checked out of governing altogether. Expecting a President to swoop in and change/fix the country in any long term way is naive. You want change, vote out your undoubtedly courrupt state representatives and vote in someone who can&#39;t get bought for a 2,000 dollar check.</p>

<p>Although this sub has a bit of a problem with hyperbole and an inability to actually read content, instead of going for the most extreme theory and running with that as if its the truth. It is interesting to see how quickly people will fall in line when they are told what they want to hear, and how they refuse to question a theory that they themselves believe to be true.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think the most important concept is the obliteration of the concept of objective truth. </p>

<p>Other books and other mediums have done authoritarianism and a totalitarian government, and will do it again. What makes 1984 unique is the fact that the state does not achieve its ends though intimidation or brute force; it simply makes it impossible to keep straight what happens. </p>

<p>Doublethink doesn&#39;t just mean someone contradicts themselves, it means that a person can believe with all their heart that the are completely dry, while being livid that you splashed them and hold these two thoughts simultaneously without seeing an issue.  </p>

<p>They destroy any objective frame of reference so that there is no way to verify reality, to the point people can&#39;t believe their own thoughts. </p>

<p>The ultimate result of this is that whatever the state say is reality you have to believe. They say 2+2=5. You have no calculators of math books to check with. You can count on your fingers and know that two fingers on one hand and two fingers on the other hand will get you 4 fingers, and 2+2=5. &quot;And&quot; not &quot;but&quot;. There is just no contradiction there. </p>

<p>The Russian are attempting to do the same thing by though different means. Rather than destroy objective truth they attempt to make truth and lies of equal credibility. Actively discredit reputable sources, while promoting their own websites that they wrote yesterday to say whatever they want. Make enough people think that all news is fake news then you have destroyed any objective frame of reference for reality. They can make any claim they want and people are won&#39;t be able to verify what is and isn&#39;t real. In stead of being unable to locate a calculator to check if 2+2=5, they throw 100 calculators into the room and tell you they&#39;re all shitty broken calculators. They make it harder for people to tell which one is and objective source. </p>

<p>So when they say that 2+2=5 they can point to the broken calculator that says that. Then they can say 2+2=8 later, find the calculator that says that, and say the other one was busted. Maybe you can locate the working, objective calculator, but they have already raised so much doubt that you&#39;re not sure it that one really is working. </p>

<p>The banning of Russian trolls is not 1984, the Russian trolls are 1984</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Wow.</p>

<p>Crimea is a place of strategic military importance, especially for Russia. It was part of another country, and had been for over a quarter of a century. This country, Ukraine, was vying to become part of the major alliance with the US. Russia invaded it, without wearing their uniforms, overthrew the government, and <em>then</em> held a referendum asking what the Crimeans want to do. And most polls put rejoining Russia, admittedly with a plurality of the vote, at only 41%.</p>

<p>If you think that an election where 95.5% (I think the official total was actually closer to 97%) of the people vote one way is likely legitimate, when the polls prior to that put it at 41% and when they allowed no international observers, you are naive. If you think that 95.5% of the people of Crimea want to be part of Russia, when only 33% of Crimea is Russian, you are downright foolish.</p>

<p>If you can&#39;t see why this is a big deal, and you can&#39;t see the blatant conspiracy staring you in the face, you probably aren&#39;t as observant as you like to think yourself. You are probably more about trying to make things fit your narrative, rather than actually objectively looking at what is going on and rationally concluding what is going on.</p>

<p>Maybe we should stop at the admitted plurality of the vote and end the argument there, no? But then again I want to know what your thoughts are on the original decree from 1954? Disclosed to the people a week <em>after</em> it was decided behind closed doors, through the front page of a newspaper ad, no less. It was also approved by the Presidium of the Supreme council which did not hold enough seats for the quorum necessary to even pass it, having only 13 of the 27 seats, aka under 50%. </p>

<p>It should never have been illegally stolen in the first place, hence why the plebiscite had such a turnout as it did and the vote went the way it did. Thank goodness the people got what they wanted in the end!</p>

<p>You&#39;ve caught yourself in a catch-22. You can&#39;t argue that we overthrew a government that was friendly to Russia and then they invaded it back taking something of strategic military value, but that it wasn&#39;t a major issue.</p>

<p>No one said anything about a &quot;purity ring,&quot; I was just pointing out the facts, none of which you actually disputed. Even if control of the government was completely orchestrated by the US and Russia, this is just evidence that they are, in fact, a adversary.</p>

<p>But then again I want to know what your thoughts are on the original decree from 1954?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The question wasn&#39;t whether or not it was rightful property of Russia or of Crimea. The question was whether or not the annexation of Crimea by Russia was representative of a adversarial nature between the US and Russia.</p>

<p>And don&#39;t be silly. Ukraine has been independent <em>with Crimea</em> for 25 years. It&#39;s no coincidence that Russia took it back once it looked like the Ukraine was going to join NATO. If they really cared about it being their rightful property, why wait 25 years until taking it back? What changed? Oh yeah, the obvious thing, they were losing their influence over them.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It should never have been illegally stolen in the first place, hence why the plebiscite had such a turnout as it did and the vote went the way it did. Thank goodness the people got what they wanted in the end!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Wow, you can&#39;t be serious. There was 123% voter turnout. We have polls from before hand that put support for it at less than half of what they claim to have gotten. You say I&#39;m repeating propaganda, but the motivation for this move was blatantly obvious, the referendum was an obvious sham (123% voter turnout, BTW) and you are defending the move by parroting Russian propaganda. And you accuse me of being a victim of propaganda. This is amazing.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>But I did say it was major? It was just major for factors we didnt initially agree on but that of which you seem to have come around to in the opening statements of your post. Appreciated</p>

<p>And why are you telling me what we are and arent talking about? I couldnt care less about the finer nuances of <em>your</em> point my point has always been that the &#39;reclaiming&#39; of Crimea was just, hence why I posted about the Presidium of the Supreme Council&#39;s ruling being 100% illegal. And that was just from the number of seats standpoint. Even if they somehow managed to pass the bill with the actual number of seats required it was constitutionally illegal anyway! A quote to better summarise:</p>

<p>“Neither the Constitution of the RSFSR or the USSR Constitution … provide powers of the Presidium Supreme Soviet of the USSR and for the consideration of the changes in the constitutional legal status of the Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic, members of the union republics. In view of the above, the decision adopted in 1954 by the Presidium of the Supreme Soviets of the RSFSR and the Soviet Union on the transfer of the Crimean region of the RSFSR to the Ukraine SSR, did not correspond to the Constitution (Fundamental Law) of the RSFSR and the Constitution (Fundamental Law) of the USSR.”</p>

<p>So the ruling was made well before a constitutional change granted the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet (Advisory) Council the power to carry out transfers of territories. Done and dusted right there. </p>

<p>But you seem to be really invested in the whole 123% voter turnout thing so could you enlighten me with those figures please? Because im scratching my head here. Everywhere shows the plebiscites turnout to be around 80-83%, even on MSM outlets, so im curious as to how your brain is working. Are you merely comparing the overall voter turnout to the Autonomous republic of Crimeas registered voters and not adding on the 300k or so from Sevastopol? Or, (and please tell me its not this) are you referring to the long since retracted yet widely circulated claims of voter turnout based on dodgy statistics given by ITAR-TASS? After reading through it would seem(i cbf editing) that you are indeed basing it off the aforementioned, as it was ITAR-TASS who originally peddled the incorrect 123% claim based on incorrect statistics that claimed there were 1,724,563 voters total as opposed to 1,524,563. They since retracted it but not before forbes and all the other scummy &#39;news&#39; outlets peddled the disinformation. This is all backed up by the Central Election Commission of Ukraine so we can dispute the figures more if you want you but are absolutely incorrect about the matter and you will not find a modern piece that makes those claims today that hasnt since been retracted. Absolute rubbish this whole conversation.</p>

<p>For all the undecided users who couldnt be bothered reading a novel just peruse the internet and search away! Its not hard to find organic real people who are trying to shed light on Crimea since its return to Russia, wether it be through blogs or video etc.... Theres no question as to wether it was the right choice. Which is irrelevant anyway as it was the <em>peoples</em> choice.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You are correct I got the number wrong. I came across it and its since been corrected.</p>

<p>But so what? My other points still stand, 97% after no polls put it above 70% and no one was allowed to observe should be obviously suspicious to anyone. Even polls since then do not put it above 82%. And none of this changes the fact that you are still using a Russian propaganda paper to support your position. And none of this changes the fact that Russia, once it looked like Ukraine was going to join NATO, &quot;secretly&quot; invaded the area and overthrew the government.</p>

<p>We can argue for days whether or not they should belong to Russia or Ukraine, and it&#39;s not even necessarily that I disagree with you on that, but the reality is that this was a big deal and trying to play this off as some kind of democratic &quot;will of the people&quot; is just propaganda of the Putin backed overthrow of that government. Trying to downplay this event as not evidence of a strong adversarial nature between the US and Russia is even weaker.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>OK, I will entertain your troll. </p>

<p>The parallels and similarities revolve around the censoring of differing  opinions and thought. In 1984, one was not allowed to speak or even think about anything that was not approved ministry of truth content. What the fear is on reddit, is that reddit, although a private company, might shut down differing opinions at the governments behest. That one might be punished for questioning the status quo. That is the similarity. </p>

<p>Now, I never go around throwing out 1984 references as I don&#39;t feel it is a convincing argument to others. Realize, that for the bulk of redditors, this is about &quot;the donald&quot; subreddit. Its not. Banning that subreddit wouldnt solve the problem. The users would just move into other subreddits, escaping the containment of their subreddit, spreading their messaging in a way we cant easily ignore it. Given that it wouldn&#39;t solve &quot;the problem&quot;, and that it wouldn&#39;t be effective in any way, I don&#39;t feel its an important first step. And what is the second and third steps when this first step doesn&#39;t work? I think banning all bots, even the &quot;good ones&quot; and then individual users is a better approach, but even that is problematic. </p>

<p>I do see danger in silencing people. I think we are seeing the effects of people being silenced for the last 20ish years in many many ways. Silencing people doesnt change minds. Silencing people further isolates them from society. They will never change and only get worse and more extreme if they get kicked out. </p>

<p>Furthermore, reddit says that in their mass cleanup, they got rid of detectable bad actors (probably bots or the more extreme users). They say the rest are regular people who unwittingly were influenced by the bad actors. Well, how do you deal with that? I haven&#39;t seen one redditor who wants reddit Admins to &quot;do more&quot; actually come up with options. They are stuck on the idea that simply banning the Donald will work. So how does banning the Donald solve the problem? </p>

<p>Realize that the Russian influence campaign didn&#39;t create sentiments in a vacuum. It was effective because it used real feelings and sentiments of the populous and amplified it. Its reminds me of the rust belt who formally voted for obama, turning to trump. They didnt do so &quot;because of russia&quot;. Its possible that Russia was the only entity paying attention to how they felt though. The Democrats certainly missed the boat. They were &quot;surprised&quot;  that blue collar workers were even angry at their policies. So shutting down &quot;dissent&quot; speech is dangerous. You are not going to solve the problem of disenfranchisement by further isolating and ignoring people. Their sentiments are real. Its not &quot;fake Russian news&quot;. If Russia amplified it, its still not &quot;fake Russian news&quot;. These are real people with real feelings that Democrats took for granted and therefore ignored as a segment of their voting base they really should have been listening too. Same with Bernie voters. There is a big danger in the DNC chaulking up the last election to &quot;Russia&quot;. Its a scapegoat that doesnt address the real sentiments of much of their base. Furthermore, the blame game, calling these people stupid over and over,  blaming them for Clinton&#39;s loss is only further disenfranchising them.  Its not solving the problem with how people feel, if anything, it confirms everything that made them want &quot;change&quot; to begin with. Don&#39;t forget, people wanted Bernie to run in 2012. The feelings were already there society. Banning the Bernie subreddits wouldn&#39;t be an effective to get these democrats back under the DNC tent, right? It would just further silence and ignore them. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It’s been years since I’ve read the book, but I am a fan of Orwell. I think the most relevant parallel people are bringing up is the manipulation of assess to information by those in power as a key way to control the masses. If I remember correctly Winston’s whole job was to rewrite books to fit the government’s current narrative. I believe being in possession of a book that was not government approved was illegal as well. Today, in the digital hour, we don’t have to burn and rewrite books, those in power can just digitally change the information we have access to and most will blindly follow. They even have online sources to confirm that only their “facts” are true (I.e. Snopes). </p>

<p>‘Tech companies are private companies’ is one thing you brought up, but that is not necessarily relevant to comparison to the book. Yes, the government as a whole in the book fills the role of  ‘Big Brother/TPTB’ but in reality TPTB are thought by most here to be a combination of people (namely: the deep state, Soros, Rothschilds, big media etc.) We know that many tech industry giants like Mark Zuckerberg and Eric Schmidt (Facebook/google) where working directly with the dnc/Clinton/deep state machine, and in our world those are the people who have control over the information/narrative. </p>

<p>I believe what OP is referring to is Reddit (another tech giant) branding those with voices of decent “Russian trolls” as a way of silencing opposing opinions and maintaining control of the public’s access to information so that it aligns with the  agreed upon narrative of TPTB. </p>

<p>In this age we don’t have to burn books or imprison people for their opinion to control access to information- we can just delete (or change) comments and posts, we can just call things that don’t fit the narrative “hate speech” and call people who challenge it “Russian Troll”. </p>

<p>had their power structures eroded</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So... exactly what is happening in the real world? Lol. The argument was never that &quot;there is a secret society that has existed from day one&quot;. The argument is that oligarchies and &quot;deep state&quot;-style control is perfectly in line with every thing history tells us about human nature.</p>

<p>You yourself have just listed a fraction of the numerous examples that show that it is perfectly natural and overtly commonplace for humans to seek power and consolidate their power at the expense of others.</p>

<p>Just because every form of rule, throughout history, has collapsed or eroded over time, does not mean that it isn&#39;t part of human nature to build exclusive structures of power.</p>

<p>In fact, the ancient Greek oligarchs didn&#39;t have the boosted ability to spread propoganda that the internet provides. They didn&#39;t have nearly as extensive a capability as to gather data on everyone&#39;s online activities, television habits, porn habits, tax records, etc. They didnt have the ability to monitor phone calls, internet searches, read emails.</p>

<p>So, if anything, the state of technological advancement has empowered the power-seeking side of human nature for those who wish to capitalise on it.</p>

<p>So, really, it&#39;s up to you to demonstrate that power-seeking people don&#39;t exist, and that it would be impossible for them to utilize the things I mentioned, plus many, many other things, in order to establish secretive oligarchich control over industry and politics.</p>

<p>Riiiight... And that that information was so easily controlled is why every religion is fractured into competing groups with differing beliefs, right?</p>

<p>Religions are just a system of control; people, in keeping with their human nature, often seek to co-op these systems for their own gains in power. So, again, exactly what ive been saying. And, gee, I wonder <em>why</em> people would attempt to insulate a state&#39;s population from a diversity of information? It must be because it&#39;s <em>against</em> human nature for a ruler to insulate himself against dissent.... right? Makes sense.</p>

<p>You can compare big communities to countries. You can compare admins to leaders. You can compare authoritarian communities to 1984.</p>

<p>Reddit (and most other big online communities) don&#39;t want to get rid of ALL propaganda, they just choose which one they allow. Like in 1984.</p>

<p>That&#39;s not how charters work. The charters show that they meet the state and federal standards to establish a business. By your logic, every single corporation (no matter how big or small) is an agent of the government. </p>

<p>&quot;Russian Bots&quot; can easily be seen as an excuse. I actually has some eastern European friends, including my first ever job was at a metalwork company owned by a Russian Jew (owners son is still my friend) there are actual russian redditors who are not bots. </p>

<p>As you can see, we can create some sort of &quot;excuse&quot; and blow it up as a reason to purge those we don&#39;t like</p>

<blockquote>
<p>So bringing in the &quot;spying on its citizens&quot; is a red herring.</p>

<p>NSA is already spying on everyone, something that was brought in because &quot;9/11 terrorists.&quot; Its a formula: Create false flag/psy op, use said disaster to pass whatever the heck you want</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Calling this &quot;an authoritarian community&quot; because they ban some, as you admit (or at least the argument you quoted admitted), propaganda is quite a stretch.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It&#39;s not a stretch, its literally the beginning of a purge of &quot;those who the tech companies don&#39;t like under the guise of ______(Enter excuse here). In this case, the Purge is happening on Google, Twitter, FB, YouTube&#39;s Purge started last week, and lo and behold, Reddit&#39;s purge is also coinciding with the purge of the other Tech Companies. Context is everything.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>And claiming that what they did in 1984 to &quot;not getting rid of all propaganda&quot; is a ridiculous oversimplification. They banned and removed all dissenting views.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Because the formula goes like this:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>First they came for the Socialists, and I did not speak out—
Because I was not a Socialist.</p>

<p>Then they came for the Trade Unionists, and I did not speak out—
Because I was not a Trade Unionist.</p>

<p>Then they came for the Jews, and I did not speak out—
Because I was not a Jew.</p>

<p>Then they came for me—and there was no one left to speak for me.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_they_came_">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_they_came_</a>...</p>

<p>If its &quot;Just Russian Bots&quot; then no one will bat an eye, because majority are not Russian bots, while they can also systematically scoop up a few of the biggest dissenters on reddit (highest karma, most active, a mod here or there, etc)</p>

<p>Then after &quot;Russian Bots&quot; Reddit is already discussing banning T_D, r/uncensorednews, complaining that r/news mods are leftists like r/politics, and I think you can see where this is going.</p>

<p>You are simply seeing step 1: First they came for the russian bots, but I did not speak out because I was not a Russian Bot</p>

<p>However, avoiding facebook reddit and youtube is easy, you simply don&#39;t type them into your address bar and go somewhere else. While, for the vast majority of Americans, it is either a monopoly or a duopoly, and avoiding Comcast or Verizon is near impossible.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Careful or they will &quot;unperson&quot;...err...shadowban you for thoughtcrime.</p>

<p>In a perverse sort of way its actually funny when Admins have to resort to shadowbanning because they know that it fully justifies a user coming back with alt accounts and then <em>really</em> engaging in a blazing hellstorm of mischief.  When Admins shadowban, they are just &quot;cutting off their nose to spite their face&quot; because they take  one problem and turn it into a dozen problem &quot;hydra&quot; when the person eventually discovers their supposedly &quot;clever&quot; tactic.</p>

<p>Yes, shadowbanning <em>does</em> waste the time of someone misbehaving, but in a war of attrition with &quot;time wasting&quot; as the goal, there will simply never be enough Admins to outnumber the angered users they are creating.  They are fighting a losing battle.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>tfw 1984 is about the government completely controling the masses and not a private business running a website banning people that don&#39;t adhere to their moral beliefs.</p>

<p>You have no idea what youre talking about, these sites can block/ban/do whatever they want in the realm of their own forum. the simple answer is, if you dont like the way a website/business is treating you, then stop using the service. Citing 1984 makes you look ignorant.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I disagree. We&#39;re not talking about small forums but giant communities who have a huge impact on culture. Sure, you can stop using Google/Facebook/Reddit/Twitter, but you will probably become an outcast. Internet presence is getting more and more important. If you&#39;re an artist, or a programmer, or a small company owner or a million other occupations, you almost need to be a part of these communities. This need will grow, though the companies themselves may change.</p>

<p>Communities transcend geopolitical borders. Our actual nationalities are becoming less and less relevant. We don&#39;t care if the people we chat daily with are from another country as long as they&#39;re our brothers from our beloved subreddit/fb group/hashtag. Online communities are the countries of tomorrow. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>So then really your argument is that web forums are either more important than the government, or should be run by a government body? I disagree on both these viewpoints for a few reasons, more importantly, Reddit is privately owned and matter-of-factly doesn&#39;t owe you or your viewpoints shit. I&#39;m not happy with that being reddits future, and you can do whatever you want with that information, but at the end of the day thats how it is. </p>

<p>r/russia is particularly aggrieved by spez&#39;s announcement that reddit will be hunting high and low for hidden Russian trolls.</p>

<p>Dominant media corporations - Fkbook, twitter, youtube, reddit are the non-governmental versions of China&#39;s censorship, which in the west absolves them of any kind of free speech adherence; we&#39;re a private company we can do what we want. </p>

<p>China is leading the way for where the internet is really going. And it ain&#39;t free interaction and mingling of ideas.</p>

<p>European countries have passed laws against hate speech. China recently banned the N. When does N become ----&gt; hate speech and therefor ----&gt; banned by corporate social media platforms who can allow or censor anything they choose.</p>

<p>You can be sure that&#39;s exactly where all of this is headed.</p>

<p>Nice grammar, comrade.</p>

<p>Anyway, your argument is ridiculous. Anything that could be construed as serving America&#39;s interests couldn&#39;t possibly have happened? So nothing in history that has ever served American interests has ever happened? WWII ending was just a smokescreen? The Cold War never happened or never ended?

<p>Fair enough...assume just for the sake of discussion that that was real...one point against Russia...now how about mentioning the multitude of points against Israel?  Did bombing school children with white phosphorus help the cause of peace any?  Has kidnapping, torturing and threatening children with rape...calmed things down?

<p>Jesus, you&#39;re daft.

<p>Yes, but the poster, I believe unless I missed something Obama said, tried to spin the &quot;rig&quot; comment into &quot;interfere,&quot; presumably to make their point that this was only made up after they lost.</p>

<p>But there is a lot of evidence that Obama had been warned about this prior to those comments.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Trump was saying in 2016 that Clinton was going to rig the election with illegal votes and that if he didn&#39;t win they would challenge it. Clinton and Obama said that obviously wasn&#39;t true, and that whatever the election outcome was, they would accept the result in that context.</p>

<p>Now it&#39;s two years later and we know that the election was being influenced by a foreign government. Trump&#39;s win may indeed be less than &quot;legitimate&quot;. Especially since we&#39;ve also learned that Russian hackers had access to the voter rolls in many swing states.</p>

<p>However, nobody is talking about declaring his win to be illegitimate and throwing him out if office and installing Clinton. We&#39;ve still all accepted, including Clinton, that Trump is president.</p>

<p>Sometimes you learn new information that causes you to change your stance on an issue. That doesn&#39;t make you a hypocrite. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Just like you&#39;re about to learn that the intelligence communities you&#39;ve been bandying about have come out and said Russia had to material influence on the outcome of the election and while they attempted to access voter rolls, none were changed. Are you under the impression that Russia hacked DNC servers and released truthful information that helped the public make a more informed choice? Even though I&#39;d kinda appreciate that effort, I can see an argument where that&#39;s distressing on a national security level. The democrats don&#39;t think so though, because they refused multiple times to turn that server over for investigation by the FBI. Huh.</p>

<p>We already know many illegals we&#39;re registered to vote and some did, though a full investigation hasn&#39;t been performed. We also know loads of dead people seem to be big fans of the democrat party, and we have from the horses mouth from the dem NYC voting commissioner how they bus people around and fuck the system in that was. We have video of Scott foval admitting to fucking the republicans by cheating and that they&#39;ll be damned if they ever stop. There&#39;s also the question of why Soros owns 2/3 of electronic voting machines and why those machines are programmed with the ability to give individual votes a decimal point tally.</p>

<p>So I&#39;m sorry bub, but there were many legitimate questions going into this highly contentious winner takes all election. The sort of &quot;meddling&quot; you&#39;re referring to from Russians (and Chinese and whoever else) was known about by Obama when he made the statements we&#39;re referencing them. At the time though, they were certain Hillary was going to win so they didn&#39;t want to cast any doubt in the results if she did.</p>

<p>Let&#39;s be clear in what they&#39;re saying. The IC doesn&#39;t think, according to what they&#39;ve said publicly, that votes were changed or that voter rolls were altered, but they do think that Russia was involved in an influence campaign in the election. </p>

<p>Given the first hand accounts of people showing up to vote only to be told they weren&#39;t registered when days before that they checked and <em>were</em> registered, I think the IC has been slowly revealing more and more information about the depth of the hacking in order to not cause a mass panic by dumping what they know all at one time. </p>

<p>That&#39;s the thing about propoganda; it often does have elements of truth in it. But that doesn&#39;t change that it&#39;s propoganda, and when it comes from a foreign country it&#39;s not for altruistic intentions. I love the language you used here by the way, &quot;help the public make a more informed choice&quot; as if fucking Vladimir Putin was engaging in his patriotic American civil duty. Lol. </p>

<p>Alright I&#39;ll keep that in mind in 2020, I hope Kamala Harris teams up with Mexico to lead a propoganda and hacking campaign against Trump. </p>

<p>Well I&#39;m glad you agree with our IC then. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>The democrats don&#39;t think so though, because they refused multiple times to turn that server over for investigation by the FBI. Huh.</p>

<p>They had it privately investigated by a company that specializes in that kind of work. Should they have also had the FBI look into it? Probably, but then people like you would just say &quot;well of course James Comey agreed with the DNC line&quot; and so it wouldn&#39;t really make a difference either way would it? </p>

<p>The point is, the FBI also accepted CrowdStrike&#39;s findings. </p>

<p>Again no source. But I was able to find this one myself. </p>

<p>To be clear, he wasn&#39;t &quot;admitting to something he and the democrats did together,&quot; so it isn&#39;t really &quot;from the horse&#39;s mouth&quot;. He&#39;s alleging that other people do it. So okay, one dude claims that other people do something they shouldn&#39;t be doing. If he has proof, he should provide it so it can be stopped. Does he have proof? No, of course not. But all project Veritas has to do is find one idiot with a D next to his name that is willing to say some crazy shit and then that&#39;s immediately proof to you of a conspiracy to rig an election. </p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Yes, but NOT BY THE PUBLIC. He made those statements to the public in a way that the context of the situation at the time would only imply the specific meaning of a response to what Trump was saying. Trump was saying, &quot;Clinton is going to rig the election via voter fraud&quot;. Obama responded to that, saying, &quot;No she&#39;s not, it&#39;s basically impossible to rig an election that way&quot;. He wasn&#39;t saying <em>anything</em> about Russia in that quote. This is like taking somebody in 1968 saying &quot;we&#39;ve never been to the moon&quot; as proof that the moon landing in 1969 didn&#39;t happen. The context of the quote clearly implies that Obama was talking about Trump&#39;s claims of voter fraud. Not outside election interference. </p>

<p>At the time though, they were certain Hillary was going to win so they didn&#39;t want to cast any doubt in the results if she did.</p>

<p>Ah, that claim was more fun when <a href="https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-says-obama-so-sure-clinton-would-win-didnt-stop-russian-meddling/3916428.html">Trump made it last year</a>. But which is it? Was Obama doing absolutely nothing about Russia or was Obama spying on the Trump campaign and its Russian ties? </p>

<p>Another reading of the facts would be that the IRA was exploiting the polarization of opinions in the US (which existed long before 2016) to generate demographically distinct audiences through sensationalist click baiting in an effort to peddle them to advertisers. </p>

<p>From Mueller&#39;s Russian troll indictment:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Defendants, posing as US. persons and creating false U.S. personas, operated social media pages and groups designed to attract U.S. audiences. These groups and pages, which addressed divisive US. political and social issues, falsely claimed to be controlled by US. activists when, in fact, they were controlled by Defendants. Defendants also used the stolen identities of real U.S. persons to post on social media accounts. Over time, these social media accounts became Defendants&#39; means to reach significant numbers of Americans ...</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And now the kicker:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Defendants and their co-conspirators also used the accounts to receive money from real U.S. persons in exchange for posting promotions and advertisements on the ORGANIZATION-controlled social media pages. Defendants and their co-conspirators typically charged certain U.S. merchants and U.S. social media sites between 25 and 50 U.S. dollars per post for promotional content on their popular false U.S. persona accounts, including Being Patriotic, Defend the 2nd, and Blacktivist.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In the context of a commercial marketing scheme, the fact that the online activities ran long after the election, the fact that the ads and tweets were not universally anti-Hillary nor pro-Trump, the fact that the entire budget for the scheme was laughably small compared to billions spent domestically on the election, and the fact that everything was so amateurish and easily traceable all suddenly make sense.</p>

<p>The reason the Russian trolls stuff was so sensationalist and polarized was not because they were trying to sow discord and division--it was because that&#39;s what fucking clickbait has to be to work.</p>

<p>With YouTube hiring the SPLC to police their content they basically flaunted their bias. I mean come on, MAC, James Yeager, and a number of other gun channels being banned or striked / flagged right after the introduction of the SPLC, but no strikes for jake Paul Logan Paul etc? Yeah fucking right. Not to mention the InfoWars channel being striked for their crisis actor James Hogg video. It’s so obvious that they’re showing bias. Yes it’s disgusting content but it’s also free speech, they’re not inciting violence or releasing anything but his name and face thatve been plastered on pretty much every news outlet. </p>

<p>I’m afraid for the future of society and our first amendment. I’d go as far to say all the assaults on the second amendment are distractions from our first amendment rights being stripped away. </p>

<p>The VP of advertising at Facebook said there were no significant as buys from Russia until after the election.</p>

Too busy dividing Americans with his rhetoric to realize the shady shit going on in the background.</p>

<p>This whole &quot;the establishment is shaking in their boots!&quot; shtick is hilarious. I really wonder how far you can bury your heads in the sand before it finally becomes too much.</p>

<p>Meanwhile he makes a comment about becoming President for life like is happening in China AND confiscating guns without due process and his supporters still slob on his knob. If that was Obama y&#39;all would be out in the streets rioting for fucks sake.</p>

<p>Trump is a billionaire conman with billionaire conman friends, who have spent their entire lives looking after themselves and stepping on the little guy. Trump is entrenched in the establishment and has no intentions of &quot;draining the swamp&quot;. They&#39;re not terrified of him, he&#39;s their useful idiot that takes all the flak for their fucked up policies.</p>

<p>Oh, that guy that was posting all that incriminating stuff about the government and Reddit admins? Oh yeah, that was fake news. He was a Russian bot. Ignore him.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The world used to view the diversity of beliefs to be a strength.  Now they label and/or ban points of view that they disagree with or seem distasteful.  If they keep this up, the only people left on Reddit will be those who agree with each other and those who have differing beliefs will move to a different platform where they share a community of like-minded contributors (like Steemit).</p>

<p>The problem is that once this happens on a large scale is that you end up with echo chambers of users who all share like-minded ideas.  Any arguments deviating from the status quo becomes something to shun or ban.  Because these communities do not allow opposing viewpoints progressive thinking stops.  Instead, conversations turn inward and nobody questions anything anymore.</p>

<p>This is the exact kind of &#39;divide and conquer&#39; technique used by oppressive governments since the creation of mass media.  What is even more troubling is how many people seem completely OK with it because the media isn&#39;t run by &quot;the government&quot;.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh, you know. Just look at history!</p>

<p>1900s: &quot;You want an 8 hour day and a 40 hour week? You&#39;re fired. Enjoy living on the streets.&quot;
1910s: &quot;Our soldiers are dying in the trenches and you&#39;re sapping morale on the homefront by saying the war is pointless. That&#39;s sedition!&quot;
1920s: &quot;The Bolsheviks are taking over. Socialists like you have to be removed!&quot;
1930s: &quot;How dare you suggest that the government and corporations caused the Great Depression!&quot;
1940s: &quot;Why should we fight the Germans? They&#39;re the only ones doing something about the Jews and the commies.&quot;
1950s: &quot;Heard you whistled at a white woman. Boy, that&#39;s the last mistake of your life.&quot;
1960s: &quot;Oh, that Martin Luther King. He&#39;s just a race-baiting agitator! I hope somebody does something about him.&quot;
1970s: &quot;Anybody against the war in Vietnam is a coward and a traitor!&quot;
1980s: &quot;Who cares if a bunch of fags die of this gay disease? They brought it on themselves.&quot;
1990s: &quot;Of course we don&#39;t want another Vietnam. That&#39;s why we need to censor our coverage of this Gulf War.&quot;
2000s: &quot;Love it or leave it! If you don&#39;t let the government spy on you, the terrorists win!&quot;
2010s: &quot;The only good communist is a dead communist!&quot;
2018: &quot;The world used to view the diversity of beliefs to be a strength.&quot;</p>

<p>I don&#39;t think people see much more than their social media accounts these days. There is an entire planet out there, full of riches, mysteries and beautiful things. On the flip side of course there are countless atrocities committed, starvation, degradation of peoples dignities etc.. that&#39;s the way it is. To impose an ideology on people that essentially tells them that there is a right way and a wrong way to think is worse than even the most horrendous thing a free thinking person could ever commit. They are trying to paralyze humankind. </p>

<p>We have truly lost a great deal here. We&#39;ve lost the art that is human existence and with it the ability to learn and grow on our own accord and of our own mistakes, instead we have manufactured our own version of it and processed the entirety of natural substance out of it.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve been posting from the same handful of sources for a decade now (zerohedge, etc), and all of the sudden I&#39;m a Russian propagandist! </p>

<p>One of the sources I use is journal-neo.com, partly because I like their content, and partly because TMOR gets whipped into a frenzy because they are convinced NEO is Russian propaganda and I&#39;m getting paid to spread it (it&#39;s not and I&#39;m not).</p>

<p>However, it&#39;s concerning to me that a comment in <em><a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a></em> that&#39;s accusing the mods of being Russian propagandists (without <em>any</em> evidence!) gets 57 upvotes.</p>

<p>If you&#39;re going to accuse us of something so dramatic, you&#39;d better be able to back it up otherwise you&#39;re guilty of propagating this manufactured and divisive hysteria.</p>

<p>Not to mention its painfully obvious to everybody that cnn is nothing more than democrat propoganda</p>

<p>Also worth noting: fox DID NOT collude with trump officials to report a false story</p>

<p>Thats just more evidence of left wing media lying again to discredit the one REAL news network on tv</p>

<p>A CNN spokeswoman told the Daily Mail Online the emails are &#39;completely unremarkable&#39;. </p>

<p>&#39;When preparing for interviews we are regularly sent suggestions from rival campaigns and political parties, both solicited and unsolicited,&#39; she said. </p>

<p>&#39;Casting a wide net to ensure a tough and fair interview isn&#39;t just common media practice, it&#39;s smart.&#39;   </p>

<p>Do you have any proof that this is not standard practice?  For example, that Fox News never did this with RNC? How do we find out, since Wikileaks and Russia only released DNC emails and we don&#39;t have RNC emails to read? </p>

<p>Do you think RNC emails will show no &quot;media collusion&quot; as you call it?</p>

<p>No, the reporters contacted her campaign about a story they were going to publish anyway so they can add the comment to the story. They do it with all news subjects, including Fox News with Republicans.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So you&#39;re gonna go with the one Pew study from 2007? Because that&#39;s the only study I can find going that way.<br/>
I can find about a dozen going the other way, including one published in a <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0047272715000523">peer-reviewed economics journal in 2015</a>. That study found that Fox News viewers were more knowledgeable about pro-Republican topics, but less knowledgeable about pro-Democrat topics in a way that actually averaged out to zero.<br/>
The other issue is that this wasn&#39;t about Republicans vs. Democrats, but Fox News vs. CNN. That same study found that <a href="http://www.people-press.org/2007/04/15/public-knowledge-of-current-affairs-little-changed-by-news-and-information-revolutions/">viewers who relied solely/primarily on Fox News scored lower than individuals who relied solely/primarily on CNN</a>.</p>

This is circumvented by VPN of course but they can also track activity and frequency that align with some known accounts. Also, if what OP claims is true they would have used that logic to crush the_donald saying all the moderators were Russian operatives.

I&#39;ve banned a number of them from this sub</p>

<p>[–]Thoth_the_5th_of_Tho 66 points 23 hours ago 
What signs do you look for when looking for them? Do they frequently phrase stuff in a similar way?</p>

<p>[–]todayilearned83 116 points 23 hours ago 
I&#39;m not going to tell them how they&#39;re messing up, but I will tell you I look for patterns and phrasing is one of them.</p>

I love that dumbfuck mods are basically admitting they ban people for phrasing things weirdly. Also, isn&#39;t Reddit a website on the internet, which people from all over the world can connect to? Why do you think it&#39;s ok to ban people for speaking oddly?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I can&#39;t find a single pop culture reference to the phrase before this, and if there is it certainly wouldn&#39;t change my point and the fact would remain that she popularized it. Being pedantic and disingenuous won&#39;t change actual facts.</p>

<p>&quot;Alternative facts&quot; is a phrase used by U.S. Counselor to the PresidentKellyanne Conway during a Meet the Press interview on January 22, 2017, in which she defended White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer&#39;s false statement about the attendance numbers of Donald Trump&#39;s inauguration as President of the United States. When pressed during the interview with Chuck Todd to explain why Spicer &quot;utter[ed] a provable falsehood&quot;, Conway stated that Spicer was giving &quot;alternative facts&quot;. Todd responded, &quot;Look, alternative facts are not facts. They&#39;re falsehoods.&quot;[1]</p>

<p>Conway&#39;s use of the phrase &quot;alternative facts&quot; to describe demonstrable falsehoods was widely mocked on social media and sharply criticized by journalists and media organizations, including Dan Rather, Jill Abramson, and the Public Relations Society of America. The phrase was extensively described as Orwellian. Within four days of the interview, sales of the book 1984 had increased by 9,500%, which The New York Times and others attributed to Conway&#39;s use of the phrase, making it the number-one bestseller on Amazon.com.[2]</p>

<p>I&#39;m not sure what you mean by that... but anyways sorry, I mean &quot;Alt-right&quot; where did that term start? Was it a self proclaimed term or a negative concoction of sorts? I remember that whole alternative facts in the news... crazy stuff.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;ve really got to look at this through the lens of a cult.</p>

<p>-Look at Scientology: The entire group of ideas are made up by people with clear psychological problems and a desire for power.  Many words are created out of thin air or defined however they feel like defining them.  Members are ostracized for questioning the faith, and people who try to stop them are attacked.</p>

<p>-Look at Modern Feminism:  The entire group of ideas are made up by people with clear psychological problems and a desire for power.  Words are created out of thin air or defined however they feel like defining them.  Members are aggressively ostracized for questioning the group, and people who try to stop them are attacked.</p>

<p>-Now look at modern social media culture:  The group has defined it&#39;s values based, significantly, on the modern feminism from above.  Words are defined however they feel like defining them.  Narratives, with very little factual support, are built up and held as absolute truth.  Questioning anything from within the group leads to ostracism and, thus, a desire to toe the line.  Objections lead to being aggressively attacked.  Direct opposition is (beginning to be) banned entirely.</p>

<p>This is a pattern.  We&#39;ve weaponized cultism.  The longer I watch this happen the less I believe it&#39;s organic and the more I truly believe we&#39;re being played like pawns on a grand chessboard.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was extremely thrilled to hear his vocal support of mental health support and the idea that some people can violate their ability to own guns because of known threats. I think everyone should be able to own a gun...and I think if you openly threaten to kill someone your ability to own that gun should go away as soon as possible. This may result in more &#39;spontaneous&#39; murders as people learn not to &#39;broadcast&#39; which creates another problem to deal with. I don&#39;t think it&#39;s a never ending cycle it&#39;s just that a multi-pronged solution is necessary. Improving the overal mental health of our youth should be our Nation&#39;s number one priority. What sort of future are we to lead if our children are...well...Fucked in the head? </p>

If someone gets caught exposing themselves they get put on the sex offender list.  If someone makes threats of any kind they should be barred from owning.  Guns aren&#39;t toys.  I live in Texas I know all too well.  I love guns lol.  They were doing protests by my house walking around with AR-15s over their shoulders.

<p>Honestly, I think the root of the problem is the federal reserve.  We were warned about having a centralized bank and political parties.  It gives them complete control and divides us. We do all have the same set of morals and values basically.  I think the problem is the dems and reps are too busy calling each other names and having their thumbs up their asses.  I&#39;m a bit idealistic about a better united future but I&#39;m also realistic lol. </p>

<p>I wish more people would talk to Trump supporters without the presumption they&#39;re some white supremacist idiot.  Same with the dems.  I enjoy talking to all sorts of people.   How else can you really know someone lol.  More people should try to be the bridge between opposing opinions.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No the original &quot;colonists&quot; were Dutch and French people escaping religious persecution. They filled a gap left over when the Portuguese illness whipped out the Khoisan. The British were afraid that the Dutch would get to wealthy so they took over the cape. The Dutch still wanting to be free fled into the interior where they made a deal with the zulus for land. A deal that the zulus backed out off and slaughtered the Dutch who were forced to fight back.

    <div class="md"><p>I understand why. It is very convenient to have a common enemy for the people to rally behind. This has always been a great way to motivate large groups. If the media constantly talked about all of the it operations then it would seem like a non issue and people would lose interest. But focus all efforts on one group, one country and you can rally people. </p>

<p>For the record I want justice served and Russia should be held accountable for this travesty. But a ton of foreign money influenced these electrons and the people responsible should be held accountable too. Efforts run by super pacs to manipulate voters was called astroturfing because it was so common and they pretended to have grass roots origins. Orgs like correct the record which flooding social media with propaganda are a prime example. No one should be let off the hook just because targeting Russia is the most convenient way to unite the country against a common enemy and potentially take out our idiot president at the same time. </p>

<p>But I get it, we can&#39;t focus on everyone or else people might not care enough to do anything. So we focus on one or two bad guys and maybe some progress will get made. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You sweet summer child. The method of implementation is much more subtle, pervasive and fucked up than you can imagine.</p>

<h2>For the most part, the Russians stick to memes and news reposts.    But when you&#39;re a native English speaker, there&#39;s a whole world of pms and social interaction to exploit.  You can push buttons, stalk a particular user for weeks down voting everything they say, have several other...colleagues... join in to express incredulity that someone could possibly hold such ridiculous ideas...you can isolate them and emotionally devour them in the background using the psychology of the upvote, appeal to numbers. </h2>

<p>By making every attempt to engage in ideas that before may have started heated discussion and a flood of random 2 cents now an imminent round of insults, incredulity, repetition of the same basic definitions that you&#39;ve repeated countless times the last time you posted, you  make your fellow man into an object of anxiety and fear.</p>

<p>The digging is relentless, and always cast with the implication that you brought it on Yourself.   Look,you&#39;ve got 5 down votes and 3 people at once sitting on 15 upvotes calling you ridiculous and accusing you of harming whatever your given movement is by holding such ideas - clearly the problem must be you not them right?  But the response just seemed so rude and personal... but clearly the community thought it was reasonable to react in such a way, and why should I expect some rando off the Internet to engage with me as if we&#39;re in real life?  Its the internet, gotta let it slide off your back, sticks and stones.  </p>

<p>That works the first few weeks.  But your monkey brain can&#39;t stop analyzing those numbers of aproval and disproval, the character of the responses and the consistency....every time.  The repetitive conditioning that when you post, your ideas invite disdain and the community is united in their incredulity becomes the expectation.</p>

<p>Extend it naturally.</p>

<p>Offline
That must mean when i speak,
 everyone 
Is mocking me in their heads.</p>

<p>But you dont engage with people like that! You  try not to be a dick, you dont just needlessly ridicule others or present their crazy unpopular idea as a representation of their general worth - but that must just be how society has evolved, and you were one of the weak who was so thick you never saw them laughing behind your back.</p>

<p>You question where humanity has gone, and if there is any hope at all, any point in trying to make a better world if this is how we will treat each other.</p>

<p>So you unsubscribe from the democratic socialists mailing list.  You never go to their meetings, or help them organize.  You probably skip voting - what&#39;s the point?  </p>

<p>Or maybe you go the darker route, and vow to adapt...  It&#39;s every man for himself, now.  If society wants to treat you like a marginalized piece of shit, you&#39;ll join the other marginal pieces of shit then.  You won&#39;t be weak again, because now you&#39;ve learned the truth of what human nature is, and it requires rethinking your entire approach to how society should and ought to functuon.</p>

<p>Dark times upon us friends.</p>

<p>I&#39;m sure Russia has internet trolls, as I&#39;m sure every other country meddles in every other country&#39;s business. Welcome to geopolitics. Russia&#39;s influence seems to be incredibly overblown. I&#39;d be incredibly surprised if China didn&#39;t have a similar influence, as well as many of our allies. Everyone has a stake in the U.S election, they&#39;d be stupid to not try and interfere. We&#39;re just using Russia as the current boogeyman as the middle east has been largely pacified and we always need an enemy.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Clearly all of Flynn&#39;s sketchy doings didn&#39;t stretch before Trump picked him. Not like Obama&#39;s admin gave advice to not hire the guy as he as previously fired.</p>

<p>Page plead guilty to a count of conspiracy against the US. I believe there were some others named but that is the one that comes to mind. Same dude who has FISA surveillance renewed on him for what like 2 years before he was hired by Trump. Manafort got caught up in paperwork initially but I think he has other charges on him now.</p>

<p>In this case I&#39;m fairly certain said manager knew about his employee&#39;s skeletons but still hired him anyways.</p>

<p>Pretty sure that whole conspiracy against the US is the Russian meddling charge you keep asking for. And as I said earlier, gotta wait til the end of the investigation before claiming no charges exist. </p>

<p>No one knows exactly how far it goes...</p>

<p>All we know is that it goes so far that Trump is still hiding his tax returns, his appointees have all committed crimes by hiding the meeting, and Mueller has 5 indictments and counting.</p>

<p>You can&#39;t name any other investigation with that much incriminating evidence in all of US history.</p>
