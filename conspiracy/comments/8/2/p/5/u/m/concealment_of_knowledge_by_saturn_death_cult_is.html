        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p><strong>The most important secret they conceal is the godlike power each of us possess to love and create.</strong></p>

<p>If I can ask that you look at the world around you right now, wherever you are. While you do that, just stop and think of your life. Please ignore the endless procession of fuckeries and injustice you’re aware is surely occurring to multiple someone’s, in various somewheres and elect only to focus on the more commendable aspects of humanity. The cool people you’ve met, times you’ve had, places you’ve seen, meals you’ve eaten, all underpinned by a collective ability to manifest abstract concepts into tangible actuality.</p>

<p>We’re a fucking bad ass species, no?</p>

<p>We wanted to live in colder places - we created clothes. We wanted to cross water - we created boats. We longingly observed the birds in the sky until we could take it no longer - we created planes. Satisfied for a while we marvelled in this new power- but still we longed for more. 
The moon had always been a stalwart companion of humanity, a bulwark against the terrors of the night and a marvel to behold to boot, yet it had always been a source of mystery and awe.. but still , <em>what if we could actually go there? <a href="https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=g25G1M4EXrQ">Wouldn’t that be something?</a>?</em></p>

<p>All technology - spear to space shuttle- is the manifestation of this. More so than any other quality, our inherent ability to create - <em>to mentally visualise and then subsequently manifest in the physical form</em>, is and has always been humanity’s defining quality. We marvel when we observe animals displaying even infantile elements of this - but again even our ability to <em>create</em> a mindspace in which to  form this comparison, uniquely identifies us as different (<a href="http://s-f-walker.org.uk/pubsebooks/pdfs/Julian_Jaynes_The_Origin_of_Consciousness.pdf">see Jaynes - Origins of Consciousness in the breakdown of the Bicameral Mind</a>
Along with love (<em>conscious desire</em>), it’s been the driving force behind our ascent to the stars - it’s quite literally the reason each of us exist: Love + Creation = Humanity.</p>

<p>So we can argue against the dogma of mainstream science when it states that there is no rhyme or reason to creation, that we’re the mere manifestation of an unbroken series of fortuitous coincidences. That there exists no entity/force/originator possessing both the conscious desire (love) and ability (create) to initiate happenings on a universal scale. If you can be convinced that all that exists is the material, then through their control of the material - they can control you entirely. But if you can innately understand that <strong>you</strong> aren’t your hands, any more than <strong>you</strong> are your brain, then you’re only a small leap away from appreciating that you are in fact something more than you have been led to believe, then you can never be truly controlled. </p>

<p>We can argue with confidence, as our conscious awareness of our existence, coupled with an innate ability to love and create,  stand as  testament to this fact - we are much more than we’ve been led to believe.</p>

<p>A self improving, conscious organism that possesses sufficient intelligence to construct novel solutions to external stimuli, to the extent we’ve been able to mould an entire planet to a design of our likings, filled with creations of our making.</p>

<p>Short of the obvious (people born with severe cognitive handicaps etc), I truly believe with the appropriate guidance and resources, every single baby born on this planet, has the capacity to manifest into maturity as a highly capable individual, skilled in a variety of disciplines and fully able to contribute to humanity’s progression in all manner of ways. Look at how far we’ve advanced as a species with the more noteworthy contributions coming from a small minority, plucked from the pool of the economically advantaged. 
That’s not to say there’s not instances in recent times or recorded history of anomalies surfacing who bucked the trend. But for the most part, recorded history has told a tale of the wealthy becoming so through exploitation of the masses, and you can reliably infer that a greater number of that wealthy will become educated to the extent they can deliver contributions that advance our collective capabilities or/and understandings. </p>

<p>With resources to thrive- nutrition, varied &amp; engaging education, a stable family environment, access to healthcare etc kids grow to be capable adults. Even without that, kids grow to be capable adults. With that  - In our current system of global governance, the propensity towards systemic inequality is inevitable.</p>

<p>Depending on where you are in your journey, you’ll understand the reason things are like that is because a small group of very powerful banking and industry families, their lackeys and frontmen have hijacked and now control for their own ends, institutions that should rightly be operating in the interest of all humanity. I imagine most here can take it a little further, and realise it goes further than just wanting to make money, and that these families and affiliated organisations &amp; persons,  in some cases whole genetic lines  belong to a millennia old cult devoted to the worship of  a Saturnian golden age.  </p>

<p>They understand that, in addition to sating sexual desires of these fiends, that <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/1cm0t3/original_research_the_mountain_of_evidence_for_a/?st=JEH8OGR3&amp;amp;sh=37d22646">systemic elite pedophilia</a>  functions as part of Mystery Babylon’s blackmail network. It’s chief purpose  to ensure compliance &amp; continued secrecy of their nefarious subterfuge of humanity, through the entrapment of  would-be participants in compromising situations (<a href="https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=6yRVhOCw3LY">see Roy Cohn</a> &amp; <a href="https://nypost.com/2016/10/09/the-sex-slave-scandal-that-exposed-pedophile-billionaire-jeffrey-epstein/">Jeffrey Epstein</a> </p>

<p>That the current cabal are just the latest manifestation of the usury driven, Babylonian system created by the priest schools that emerged after the fall- this is what The Tower of Babel refers to. The tower falling refers to the global collapse of the Ponzi scheme we know is inevitable in economies built on debt-based finance.</p>

<p>The popular misconception that the “myth” is a cautionary tale warn against overreach &amp; arrogance is exactly that-yet another piece of disinformation foisted upon the masses to conceal the truth: that they’ve been here before, </p>

<p>Matthew 7:16</p>

<p><a href="http://saturndeathcult.com/crimes-of-the-saturn-death-cult/the-tower-of-babel-myth/">Ive found Troy D Mchlachans site Saturn Death Cult </a> a valued resource:</p>

<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The people who joined in on the Babel project had a way of doing things, a system of operating and this was the real threat to the occupants of heaven (i.e. those in authority).  The reference to ‘speech’ in the 7th verse is from the Hebrew word ‘debar’ and it refers to the means of communication by which the ‘caphah’, or ‘way of doing things’, was co-ordinated.  Why would the writer repeat himself by using both ‘language’ and ‘speech’ in the first verse if he simply meant the spoken language of the people?</p>

<p>Babel, therefore, represented a ‘way of doing things’ that was different to those who traditionally held authority.  Because Babel is linguistically linked to Babylon, and because Babylon is symbolic of a counter-financial system in opposition to the biblical God, we can safely assume that Babel was primarily a financial system under the control of those who resided in its infamous ‘Tower’.  That tower, as we have seen, was the central temple and it has as its modern day equivalents, I believe, the various central banks of this modern era.</p>

<p>“They” (<em>members of various blood line families, mystery school adherents, their inductees etc</em>) are the custodians and operatives of a global system of control - that cycles through national currencies every few centuries, setting up central banks, operating fractional reserve confidence scams, hoovering up physical resources and labour with the resultant capital. It’s promissory notes are backed by nowt to be dispensed, circulated and returned with interest on the compound. Interest on the compound - a further fee on the debtor, presumably justified as a privilege for them receiving the loan. A model that’s resulted in the rampant inequality we see across the globe. </p>

<p>If you take a loan out with interest, once you pay the compound, you’re working for the interest - ie your labour goes towards your creditor. With no interest, any credit gained from labour enacted after the debt has been paid, is yours to keep. Providing the surplus required to devote to other pursuits, learning new skills - growth. So when your countries central bank issues it’s debt based currency, they’re quite literally manufacturing future promises to repay today’s debt - ie ensuring successive generations of born into bondage.</p>

<p><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamiltonian_economic_program">The Hamilton Economic Program</a> America was founded on is more akin to what we see in the bible:</p>

<blockquote>
<blockquote>

King James Version 
25 If thou lend money to any of my people that is poor by thee, thou shalt not be to him as an usurer, neither shalt thou lay upon him usury.</p>

<p>Ecclesiastes 4:9-12 
Two are better than one, because they have a good reward for their toil. For if they fall, one will lift up his fellow. But woe to him who is alone when he falls and has not another to lift him up! Again, if two lie together, they keep warm, but how can one keep warm alone? And though a man might prevail against one who is alone, two will withstand him—a threefold cord is not quickly broken</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Having no other asset than the product of their own labours from the land on which they lived, the colonists did the unthinkable. They started to issue their own money against that very asset, and they had the temerity to issue it debt free. It was a debt-free system of financing that was diametrically opposed to the debt-based financial model as practised by Mystery Babylon and enforced by the Bank of England –and to the horror of Britain’s banking elite it seemed to be working</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p>The American system of finance was the catalyst behind a nation with majority middle class, majority adult literacy and a direct threat to the global system of debt slavery that the world labours under- <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_United_States_public_debt">something had to be done.</a> 
Each  crisis provides an opportunity for debt to be leveraged . The correlation is evident. What isn’t so apparent is the hidden hands who engineer these conflicts for that very purpose.</p>

<p>As is obvious by now,<a href="https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=5hfEBupAeo4">all wars are banker wars </a>. If the banks didn’t want a nation to go to war - they wouldn’t finance it. It works the other way too- how often have we seen Banks instigate conflicts, then fund both sides. No matter who wins, the bank wins ..twice.</p>

<p>The bible is filled with historical accounts that correlate  with non-biblical sources. Flood myths, for example, are <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_flood_myths">prevalent amongst hundreds of ancient cultures </a>  - none of whom clearly were practicing Christianity at the time. Now is the bible also filled with fallacy, wilfully inserted to maintain control through obfuscation &amp; concealment? Of that there can be no doubt. But one thing you can also verify is Jesus was real. A bonafide living breathing person- his life was documented <a href="https://www.biblicalarchaeology.org/daily/people-cultures-in-the-bible/jesus-historical-jesus/did-jesus-exist/">in numerous sources outside of the New Testament </a>. I was raised Christian and found the church a weekly series of fallacious drudgery. Then I grew up and realised aha!it was a series of semi-true tales, spliced from and replicating other earlier religions, deployed by the moneyed elite as a control mechanism to keep the unruly serfs in order. Now? The <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/6semd3/high_level_insider_mystery_schools_reddit_an/?st=JEH9VNXS&amp;amp;sh=93d4bd6b">High Level Insider threads </a> and its focus on symbology offered an interpretation of biblical events that warranted  2nd reading, this time with a (extremely) rudimentary understanding of symbology &amp; some context  (see below) in place. </p>

<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The appearance of Jesus 2000 years ago was not as a messiah but as a messenger (Islamic view of him as a prophet).
The jews are right that the first coming was not as a messiah, but wrong to reject him as a prophet because they do not understand that there were to be two separate missions (Christianity and Islam both get this right and anticipate the return).
Christianity is correct to emphasize the virginal birth and sacrifice. What the virgin birth means is that he rose to consciousness outside of the mystery schools, which laid bare the fraud of them concealing knowledge. His entire life was lived as a sacrifice spreading the truth to ensure that connection to higher consciousness / the godhead would never be the exclusive possession of the corrupted schools.
Christianity is, symbolically, the inversion of the old world order; the antithesis of the US regime. It is a first of its kind religion in this respect and of utmost significance to world history. You should know and be familiar with the Bible but it has been manipulated, pruned, incorrectly taught, and so on. We recommend Thomas and Mary, both of which were removed from the canon for being too straightforward for the old order&#39;s tolerance.</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p>I’m nowhere near done with research, but  feel I’m at the stage where I  consider most of what I was taught to be bullshit. Now  I guess I’d say Old Testament reeks of Mystery Babylon - vengeful god, concealment of knowledge is necessary etc) I think it’s an encoded collection of historical accounts and prophecies centred around the life of a man who came upon the means to achieve elevated consciousness, - The Godhead- and rather than conceal it, he chose to share it with the world.</p>

<p>Terms like being “born again” and “the kingdom of heaven is inside you” are solemnly intoned by adherents to the faith - most never really questioning wether the interpretation they’ve received from the Church is in keeping with that intended by Jesus. The pedophilic practices of the Catholic Church are no secret. It should be evident that an organisation that enacts cover ups at the highest level of such abuse, is automatically disqualified as a credible compass towards an enlightened existence. </p>

<p>Once you work through the bogus interpretations we were all fed as children  and view the biblical accounts of Jesus as a collection of allegories and symbology, the story of his life is amongst the most inspiring ever recorded. </p>

<p><a href="https://www.consciouslivingfoundation.org/ebooks/13/CLF-TheHiddenPower-ThomasTroward.pdf">Troward </a> makes the point better than I ever could:</p>

<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>He died because he maintained the Truth; that he was one with the Father. That was the substantive charge on which he was executed. &quot;Art thou the son of the Blessed?&quot; he was asked by the priestly tribunal; and the answer came clear and unequivocal, &quot;I am.&quot; Then said the Council, &quot;He hath spoken blasphemy, what further need have we of witnesses?&quot; And they all condemned him to be worthy of death.</p>

<p>And so we find throughout that Jesus nowhere makes any claim for himself which he does not also make for those who accept his teaching. Does he say to the Jews, &quot;Ye are of this world; I am not of this world?&quot; Equally he says of his disciples, &quot;They are not of the world, even as I am not of the world.&quot; Does he say, &quot;I am the light of the world?&quot; Equally, he says, &quot;Ye are the light of the world.&quot; Does he say, &quot;I and my Father are one?&quot; Equally he prays that they all might be one, even as we are one. Is he styled &quot;the Son of God?&quot; Then St. John writes, &quot;To them gave he power to become sons of God, even to as many as believe on his name;&quot; and by belief on the name we may surely understand belief in the principle of which the name is the verbal representation.</p>

<p>The essential unity of God and man is thus the one fact which permeates the whole teaching of Jesus. He himself stood forth as its living expression. He appealed to his miracles as the proofs of it: &quot;it is the Father that doeth the works.&quot; It formed the substance of his final discourse with his disciples in the night that he was betrayed. It is the Truth, to bear witness to which, he told Pilate, was the purpose of his life. In support of this Truth he died, and by the living power of this Truth he rose again. The whole object of his mission was to teach men to realise their unity with God and the consequences that must necessarily follow from it; to draw them away from that notion of dualism which puts an impassable barrier between God and man, and thus renders any true conception of the Principle of Life impossible; and to draw them into the clear perception of the innermost nature of Life, as consisting in the inherent identity of each individual with that Infinite all-pervading Spirit of Life which he called &quot;the Father.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p>So you see the fundamental issue with the bible is the disinformation. The nuggets of truth interspersed with fallacy, the way allegory and literal meaning are interchanged to deceive and confound -the virgin birth for example.  A central tenet of Christianity. The teachings have been perverted to to deny us access to the truth. “Died for our sins”? What the fuck does that even mean? Didn’t he die because the Jewish church leaders  accused him of blasphemy? For claiming that he, and us all, are all children of God by definition - - not privilege? 
We’ve been taught that the miracle of a baby born to a virgin stands as testament to his divine origins. As you’ve read, this is a deliberate obfuscation of the intended meaning. When rational people hear shit like that, they tend to switch off. I know I did. I’m sorry but I just couldn’t reconcile anything I’d been taught, had sought or observed with the absurd notion of God having a child with a woman. Like Zeus turning into a bull or a pile of Gold. I mean come on. “Wouldn’t God be having a child with themselves as they made everything?” I asked. “God moves in mysterious ways” the Pastor replied. And that was that. </p>

<p>How ironic that the condescending, illogical nature inherent in organised religion, turns so many away from the innate pivot towards questioning reality, that formed the demand  for its very existence.  And therein lies the crux of our tale. People are either turned away from the foolishness of it all, or embrace what they’ve seen, more or less. In either case they’re no nearer to what they sought than when they first started.</p>

<p>This is all by design.</p>

<p>If we realised and embraced the truth things would be very different. That we could all become a Jesus. Any of us. A personality of the ages, whose actions echo throughout history, inspiring others to assume the mantle of transcendent achievement. Like Krishna. Mohammed. Was that not the central tenet of his teachings?  That were not only are we Gods children, we are Gods also. For how can the Kingdom of heaven exist within a person ... and that person not be a King themselves?</p>

<p>Admittedly the situation at present seems pretty bleak. The concealment of knowledge in all its forms -scientific, historical, political or otherwise- ensures a gap between the enlightened and the ignorant. Control of the institutions that dispense these truths results in control of those who use them to navigate their realities - ie all of us. But it’s heartening to see people question the official narrative more these days. Oh they’ll play it down on the media or wholly omit it altogether, but ask yourself why initiatives like social media censorship, net neutrality, CTR, need be enacted unless Mystery Babylon realised people were cottoning onto the reality things are very wrong, and have been for some time. 
But if you’ve only reached that realisation in the last election cycle for example, you’d be forgiven for thinking all conspiracies were centred around Pgate, Seth Rich, Rep/Dem etc It can be somewhat discouraging to witness the subs descent into a battle group of opposing political ideologies. One the other hand, everyone has to start somewhere. </p>

<p>Pgate is a conversation away from someone in the thread who can link it to Franklin Coverup is a link from Epstein &amp; Cohns Pedophile black mail rings is a link away from CIA drug trafficking is a click away from OSS is a link away  from Opium wars etc ... is a link away from</p>

<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“So if all this other stuff is bogus, what do you think the truth is about Jesus?”</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p>So far from seeing the influx of curious minds, the flat earth psyops etc  as a negative, it should be considered a positive sign of a changing times, when the corrupt institutions that previously held authority, are exposed as frauds. The consequent shift towards research and reason can only be a mass benefit long term to the collective consciousness- people navigating the world by what we learn, rather than what we’ve been told.</p>

<p>Collective awareness of the true nature of reality will be both our salvation and the catalyst to a future of continued advancement. </p>

<p>Tl:Dr: Jesus was the original and ultimate  conspiracy theorist. His revolt against the moneyed elite laid the framework for the American Revolution. Mankind’s god given ability to advanced through creation has been subverted by Mystery Babylon. Growing awareness of this is moving us into an age of transition, itself occurring during the passing of the dollar as reserve currency, this taking place  as we move into the Age of Aquarius. Despite the strength of our adversaries, I choose to believe we emerge triumphant.</p>

<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Once, on being asked by the Pharisees when the kingdom of God would come, Jesus replied, “The coming of the kingdom of God is not something that can be observed nor will people say, &#39;Here it is,&#39; or &#39;There it is,&#39; because the <strong>kingdom of God is inside you</strong></p>

<p>The sutta also points out that unenlightened gods are still deluded, of how the demand for blind obedience to a so-called omnipotent creator god arose from Mara.

<p>Exactly this. “By their fruits you shall know them”</p>

<p>It seems their model works for a stage, with the confidence scam the economies they create, only yielding the deception towards the back end of the parasitic cycle. When they’ve hoovered up so much actual value from the people and institutions within, that it becomes obvious to all. </p>

<p>At that point it becomes easier to navigate through the lies they’ve draped over reality, for the masses then actively seek truth outside of their corrupted institutions of governance. It’s at this point I think we’re currently at. The question is will a genuine humanist alternative emerge to take advantage of the chaos... or will we be collectively herded into the next incarnation of this played out BS?</p>

<p>Call me a dreamer but I think it’s the former. I’d never heard of any tangible opposition or alternatives to the current system - until the High Level Insider threads. Now what do I think?
Space Elevators are in our future. The stars will become our playground. I feel compelled to share this realisation so all can experience the same positivity towards the future as I now do. Through our actions we create reality, no? But where do those actions begin. We must change our minds would we change the world. And that starts with believing in a future of our own choosing. Not accepting the one being created for us. Then exhibiting the behaviour that makes a future like that even possible. </p>

<p>So I’m gonna keep writing about these topics, linking our untapped potential to the hidden conspiracy that prevents us from achieving it. It’s the most important thing I feel I can contribute:</p>

<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Collective awareness of the true nature of reality will be both our salvation and the catalyst to a future of continued advancement.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My post will tell you how I used to see religion, the different phases of understanding. Where I’m at now doesn’t feel like I’m “there” in terms of full appreciation of the lessons encoded. But I feel the comprehension I have now- as a result of my own research - compared to that I was instructed into- rings far closer to something meaningful than I’ve ever known.
And everything points to the fact this Jesus guy knew the truth and lived his life as a sacrifice to ensure we know too. Even as I’m saying it, my years of mocking religious adherents make me feel embarrassed or something- like those televangelist selling dreams .. </p>

<p>“Jesus knew the truth”</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Isa 52:13  Behold, my servant shall deal prudently, he shall be exalted and extolled, and be very high.
 
Isa 52:14  As many were astonied at thee; his visage was so marred more than any man, and his form more than the sons of men:
 
Isa 52:15  So shall he sprinkle many nations; the kings shall shut their mouths at him: for that which had not been told them shall they see; and that which they had not heard shall they consider.</p>

<p>Isa 53:1  Who hath believed our report? and to whom is the arm of the LORD revealed?
 
Isa 53:2  For he shall grow up before him as a tender plant, and as a root out of a dry ground: he hath no form nor comeliness; and when we shall see him, there is no beauty that we should desire him.
 
Isa 53:3  He is despised and rejected of men; a man of sorrows, and acquainted with grief: and we hid as it were our faces from him; he was despised, and we esteemed him not.
 
Isa 53:4  Surely he hath borne our griefs, and carried our sorrows: yet we did esteem him stricken, smitten of God, and afflicted.
 
Isa 53:5  But he was wounded for our transgressions, he was bruised for our iniquities: the chastisement of our peace was upon him; and with his stripes we are healed.
 
Isa 53:6  All we like sheep have gone astray; we have turned every one to his own way; and the LORD hath laid on him the iniquity of us all.
 
Isa 53:7  He was oppressed, and he was afflicted, yet he opened not his mouth: he is brought as a lamb to the slaughter, and as a sheep before her shearers is dumb, so he openeth not his mouth.
 
Isa 53:8  He was taken from prison and from judgment: and who shall declare his generation? for he was cut off out of the land of the living: for the transgression of my people was he stricken.
 
Isa 53:9  And he made his grave with the wicked, and with the rich in his death; because he had done no violence, neither was any deceit in his mouth.
 
Isa 53:10  Yet it pleased the LORD to bruise him; he hath put him to grief: when thou shalt make his soul an offering for sin, he shall see his seed, he shall prolong his days, and the pleasure of the LORD shall prosper in his hand.
 
Isa 53:11  He shall see of the travail of his soul, and shall be satisfied: by his knowledge shall my righteous servant justify many; for he shall bear their iniquities.
 
Isa 53:12  Therefore will I divide him a portion with the great, and he shall divide the spoil with the strong; because he hath poured out his soul unto death: and he was numbered with the transgressors; and he bare the sin of many, and made intercession for the transgressors.</p>

<hr/>

<p>Does that sound like a familiar story to you?  If you deny Jesus Christ you deny the Most High.  He is the only name salvation comes by:</p>

<p>Act 4:10  Be it known unto you all, and to all the people of Israel, that by the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, whom ye crucified, whom God raised from the dead, even by him doth this man stand here before you whole.
 
Act 4:11  This is the stone which was set at nought of you builders, which is become the head of the corner.
 
Act 4:12  Neither is there salvation in any other: for there is none other name under heaven given among men, whereby we must be saved. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>A for effort OP.  You&#39;re absolutely correct, information is being kept secret. Any time someone says that they need to be the middle man to connect you with your creator, you know it&#39;s a scam. That&#39;s what almost all religions do, separate you from the creator of all, which gives the church instant power over you. It&#39;s disgusting that these con-men are still in business.</p>

<p>Just like probably everyone that&#39;s read the Bible the first time, it just didn&#39;t make any sense, in this particular case, Genesis.  Once I read the Sumerian creation story which obviously, heavily influenced the Bible, pieces started falling into place. I won&#39;t bother with details but I recommend to anyone looking for more information about man&#39;s creation to give the Sumerian story a chance. Just have an open mind.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Maybe you can help me fill in the gaps.</p>

<p>The website you reference, eht namuh, I have read through it extensively and also web crawled, which I discovered over 2000 html pages adding up to over 3 gigabytes. That&#39;s huge! The amount of text here rivals the Encyclopedia Britannica.</p>

<p>I had quite a &quot;moment&quot; you might say, upon the second or third time digging into the material. Whoever did this must be having a chuckle right now. I&#39;m pretty sure something was indeed &quot;evoked&quot; in my mind. For some reason I keep coming back to it, because of the power it seems to contain, or the way it gets my mind working to connect all the pieces of history and sacred text to get a higher viewpoint on reality. Is it meant to be a sort of hero&#39;s journey / awakening / christ consciousness thing? It is an effective mystery nonetheless.</p>

<p>Who is making this stuff? Is it an ARG? Was it generated by an AI or algorithm? The reason I ask is because it repeats the same things a lot in different ways, almost like hypnosis, lots of themes of reflection, the reflected text has the appearance of a sound wave that sort of reminded me of the Aricebo message we sent from Earth to another galaxy, and some of the pages are literally miles long with text and gematria that seem like it would be quite an undertaking for any one human, let alone an old man like David Denison.</p>

<p>I also recognize some pages have text going down the page in rainbow color, and the color is meticulously coded into the html page line by line (perhaps generated by a script?). There are a number of pages like this. It doesn&#39;t seem like Rob or David are producing this stuff themselves, and it doesn&#39;t help that Rob is vague about it. In fact it sort of reminds me of another strange thing, 9M9H9E9 (mother horse eyes / &quot;the interface series&quot;, note the use of the number 9 here too) and also <a href="/r/libraryofbabel">/r/libraryofbabel</a>...</p>

<p>Based on the material and attempt to find a &quot;magickal alphabet&quot; through numbers, it&#39;s almost as if an AI or alien is attempting to understand humanity and converse with us on our wavelength, and I do see some of David Denison&#39;s artworks being recycled (filtered in several different ways and posted again and again) by something that looks similar to Google DeepMind. Hard to pin down.</p>

<p>I also have several other theories about it.</p>

<p>PM me if you must.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Composed AFTER the letters of Paul, Mark and Matthew were INTENDED as symbolic fiction, being written in a symbolic chiastic structure.</p>

<p>Only with Luke-Acts did Christians start to view the four Gospels literally.</p>

<p>The sayings of Jesus in the Gospels are things Paul originally said. See Nikolaus Walter&#39;s ‘Paul and the Early Christian Jesus-Tradition’.</p>

<p>The events in Mark and Matthew are based on the LXX, directly borrowing its language:</p>

<p><strong>The Donkey(s)</strong> - Jesus riding on a donkey is from Zechariah 9.</p>

<p>Mark has Jesus sit on a young donkey that he had his disciples fetch for him (Mark 11.1-10).</p>

<p>Matthew changes the story so the disciples instead fetch TWO donkeys, not only the young donkey of Mark but also his mother. Jesus rides into Jerusalem on both donkeys at the same time (Matthew 21.1-9). Matthew wanted the story to better match the literal reading of Zechariah 9.9. Matthew even actually quotes part of Zech. 9.9.</p>

<p><strong>The Sermon on the Mount</strong> - The Sermon of the Mount relies extensively on the Greek text of Deuteronomy and Leviticus especially, and in key places on other texts. For example, the section on turning the other cheek and other aspects of legal pacifism (Mt. 5.38-42) has been redacted from the Greek text of Isaiah 50.6-9.</p>

<p><strong>The clearing of the temple</strong> - The cleansing of the temple as a fictional scene has its primary inspiration from an ancient faulty translation of Zech. 14.21 which changed &#39;Canaanites&#39; to &#39;traders&#39;.</p>

<p>When Jesus clears the temple he quotes Jer. 7.11 (in Mk 11.17). Jeremiah and Jesus both enter the temple (Jer. 7.1-2; Mk 11.15), make the same accusation against the corruption of the temple cult (Jeremiah quoting a revelation from the Lord, Jesus quoting Jeremiah), and predict the destruction of the temple (Jer. 7.12-14; Mk 14.57-58; 15.29).</p>

<p><strong>The Crucifixion</strong> - The whole concept of a crucifixion of God’s chosen one arranged and witnessed by Jews comes from Psalm 22.16, where ‘the synagogue of the wicked has surrounded me and pierced my hands and feet’. The casting of lots is Psalm 22.18.  The people who blasphemed Jesus while shaking their heads is Psalm 22.7-8.  The line ‘My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?’ is Psalm 22.1.</p>

<p><strong>The Resurrection</strong> - Jesus was known as the ‘firstfruits’ of the resurrection that would occur to all believers (1 Cor. 15.20-23). The Torah commands that the Day of Firstfruits take place the day after the first Sabbath following the Passover (Lev. 23.5, 10-11). In other words, on a Sunday. Mark has Jesus rise on Sunday, the firstftuits of the resurrected, symbolically on the very Day of Firstfruits itself. </p>

<p><strong>Barabbas</strong> - This is the Yom Kippur ceremony of Leviticus 16 and Mishnah tractate Yoma: two ‘identical’ goats were chosen each year, and one was released into the wild containing the sins of Israel (which was eventually killed by being pushed over a cliff), while the other’s blood was shed to atone for those sins. Barabbas means ‘Son of the Father’ in Aramaic, and we know Jesus was deliberately styled the ‘Son of the Father’ himself. So we have two sons of the father; one is released into the wild mob containing the sins of Israel (murder and rebellion), while the other is sacrificed so his blood may atone for the sins of Israel—the one who is released bears those sins literally; the other, figuratively. Adding weight to this conclusion is manuscript evidence that the story originally had the name ‘Jesus Barabbas’. Thus we really had two men called ‘Jesus Son of the Father’.</p>

<p><strong>Last Supper</strong> - This is derived from a LXX-based passage in Paul&#39;s letters. Paul said he received the Last Supper info directly from Jesus himself, which indicates a dream. 1 Cor. 11:23 says &quot;<strong>For I received from the Lord</strong> that which I also delivered to you, that the Lord Jesus in the night in which He was betrayed took bread.&quot; Translations often use &quot;betrayed&quot;, but in fact the word <em>paradidomi</em> means simply ‘hand over, deliver’. The notion derives from Isaiah 53.12, which in the Septuagint uses exactly the same word of the servant offered up to atone for everyone’s sins. Paul is adapting the Passover meal. Exodus 12.7-14 is much of the basis of Paul’s Eucharist account: the element of it all occurring ‘in the night’ (vv. 8, 12, using the same phrase in the Septuagint, en te nukti, that Paul employs), a ritual of ‘remembrance’ securing the performer’s salvation (vv. 13-14), the role of blood and flesh (including the staining of a cross with blood, an ancient door lintel forming a double cross), the breaking of bread, and the death of the firstborn—only Jesus reverses this last element: instead of the ritual saving its performers from the death of their firstborn, the death of God’s firstborn saves its performers from their own death. Jesus is thus imagined here as creating a new Passover ritual to replace the old one, which accomplishes for Christians what the Passover ritual accomplished for the Jews. There are connections with Psalm 119, where God’s ‘servant’ will remember God and his laws ‘in the night’ (119.49-56) as the wicked abuse him. The Gospels take Paul&#39;s wording and insert disciples of Jesus.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thank you as well. Study every day if you can, at least weekly. Get yourself a concordance and a few different translations of the Bible that you like, you&#39;d be surprised at some of the major differences even a word or two can make when comparing translations. Try to go back to the original Hebrew and Greek if possible and ALWAYS pray to our Father before you study and ask for wisdom and understanding. You will be shown things you never imagined. You could spend a lifetime studying and not even come close to the true brilliance I&#39;m God&#39;s word. Bless you as well, brother, may I say you made my day as well :D</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You are right that the so-called Saturn Death Cult is one of the biggest conspiracy there is. </p>

<p>there are specific technologies and practices they have kept largely hidden since the Ancient egyptians, namely the secret to accessing our own inner wisdowm and power. They have been acting under the guise of secret societies like the illuminat for centuries.</p>

<p>here is specifically what they are keeping hidden:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>chakra enhancing technologies and practices. The chakras are what enables us to unlock the higher powers. The pineal gland (third eye)  is kept intentionally calcified withdiet and lack of stimulation. the pineal gland manages the chakra system via the endocrine system in our body.</p></li>
<li><p>the true ideology of our universe, Law of One. They have given us pieces of it spread through christianity, buddhism, and islam, but its just pieces. Having knowledge of the ideology or anything closely aligned with the deep truth unlocks immense amount of individual power</p></li>
<li><p>There are currently two paths for humans to tap into their deeper, almost unlimited potential. </p></li>
</ol>

<pre><code>- meditation to the point you transcend your ego and identity
</code></pre>

<ul>
<li>dissociation so that you bypass your ego and lesser self. Think MK ultra.</li>
</ul>

<p>The dissociation path is a morally bad path with no control. Dissociative states are often induced by harsh, systematic abuse. The soul has a pain tolerance threshold, once it is reached the psyche dissociates bypassing the part of the brain filtering out greater potential. Its like a defense mechanism. During dissociation you have no awareness, no self control, and u r basically a slave. The other path requires a lot more work abd is much harder, but it allows you to be aware of and lucidly control your deeper power.</p>

<p>Most gurus who say they are enlightened have actually just figured out how to dissociate while gaining some memory of it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>chakras are energy vortexes each of us have. there are 7 main chakras.</p>

<p>root = groin = red
belly= lower stomach = orange
solar plexus = yellow
heart=green
throat=blue
third eye= purple/blue
crown chakra= top of the head= purple/white</p>

<p>its all about generating and changing your own internal frequency through channeling energy through the chakras by focusing consciousness on them and other means.</p>

<p>frequency is easiest conceived of as electromagnetic frequency. color is light energy of a specific frequency. that is what color actually is. you can resonate these chakras to create harmonies that resonate.</p>

<p>Crystals also resonate with your chakras. So can sound a la binaural beats.</p>

<p>You can combine all of these techniques during meditation.</p>

<p>If your pineal gland is calcified cuz of eating/drinking crap and lack of stimulation, you have to get that working before you can really get your chakra energy channels flowing.  </p>

<p>here is a video link that explains chakras well. its a cartoon, but its really accurate.</p>

<p><a href="https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=StrbppmsZJw">https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=StrbppmsZJw</a></p>

<p>The great pyramid was a tool used for getting people to a specific frequency or frequencies in which they could channel energy of that frequency for different ends. The way it seemed to do this was by harnessing the energy from crystal refraction via the aqueducts that flow every year when the nile flooded. the movement of water up and down in forked channels generates a sort of current. The pyramid chambers used sound to help people get to the right frequency to channel.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>my journey has been long, but overhwelmingly positive. This is the biggest conspiracy, no doubt.</p>

<p>I would say that belief plays a major part in this. I wasnt able to unlock the chakra energy in myself until I was open to it and had enough underdtanding of it to focus on. Once you believe in it and have sensitivity to really feel the energy, things accelerated really quickly. </p>

<p>Some idiots might make the psychosomatic or placebo argument. In reality, individual consciousness is much more powerful than is currently acknowledged. Thats the truth hidden from us.</p>

<p>All you have to do to unlock it is self reflect, have a good diet, and be in the right mindset.</p>

<p>Channeling energy seems to be most powerful when your mindset is filled with love and compassion for others, but you can also channel negative energy from fear, anger, and shame. All you have to do is focus on feeling the negativity as much as possible when you inhale, then relax and let it go when you exhale.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>if you can remember your experiences while on psychedelics then its not dissociative, although I would argue that a lot of what you experience while tripping is forgotten, the brain does this with anything that is fundamentally irreconciliable with your understanding of reality. So maybe you think you remember, but actually you only remember parts of the actual experience. consciousness is like an onion.</p>

<p>However, If you are sufficiently open minded so that the tripping experiences fit within an existing conceptual framework you have, then you start to remember.</p>

<p>Thats why mindset is so key. Without a framework  the experiences can attach to, they simply slip by subconsciously or are forgotten.</p>

<p>Calcification is a conspiracy unto itself. David Wolfe has done some great research as to how calcium is a major silent killer. When major health ailments get looked at under a microscope (kidney stones, arthritic buildup, plaque, etc), it looks like a coral system comprised of calcium. He goes on to say that people should be getting more magnesium rather than calcium. The idea that we should be supplementing with calcium is outdated and hugely detrimental to people.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Amazing post!</p>

<p>You explained how I see things incredibly well, and gave me some new things to think about, especially regarding Christianity and Jesus.</p>

<p>I admit that I did only just awaken during the last election cycle. Since then, I feel like I have learned more about history and what is actually going on than I had in all the previous years in my life. My research has led me to many of the same conclusions you have come to, and you have pointed out some things that I haven&#39;t yet realized but make so much sense (like the Tower of Babel, for example).</p>

<p>This is the first post I have saved, I look forward to reading the links that I&#39;m not already familiar with. Thanks for taking the time to write this, and I also appreciate your positive tone! Its refreshing and actually very logical. People really do seem to be waking up en masse, which is why we are seeing these people fight so hard against us, and that has to be a good thing.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Note:  please don&#39;t take my contradictory and critical nature to mean I don&#39;t think this post was fantastic, because I do.</p>

<p>In regards to the spiritual discussion in your post,  I don&#39;t really think concealment of knowledge is an issue.  The only path to enlightenment is a path of constant reformation, pushed forward by the developed skill of non-attachment to beliefs.  The ability to identify all things as temporary, including one&#39;s understandings.</p>

<p>What is or isn&#39;t revealed to people is irrelevant.  Those who are on a path of truth seeking cannot be kept from it, because the truth is inside themselves.  Those who would seek to mislead will only serve to push their journey forward, because any attempt would be examined, and become part of the very process that brings about enlightenment.</p>

<p>On the other hand, those that would be misled by misinformation could be led by useful information and guidance as well, sure.  But, how effective is that really?  They are still being led, and there is no understanding to be gained in being told something rather than experiencing it.</p>

<p>Those who give in to desires without regard (or with purposeful disregard) of harm they do, do so because they can&#39;t help it.  It doesn&#39;t matter who or what, that is the very nature of desire.  The illusion that one makes a choice to do or that provides the basis for hatred, both of others and of the self.  There is no choice.  Enlightenment is the path towards truly understanding that, and when one sees that then they act harmoniously because there is no resistance, no pull towards this or that, and no need to gratify an urge that has no real substantiation.</p>

<p>Started rambling there.  Thanks for the post.</p>

<p>Regarding Saturn tho... anyone have comments about Venus? I&#39;ve heard theories about how Saturn used to be more prominent in past civilizations, but what about Venus? </p>

<p>I am extremely interested in Venus and it has a lot of mystery surrounding it.... lots of oddities like being same size as Earth, only planet that spins in the opposite direction, has a &quot;stealth cloak&quot; around it with its reflective atmosphere that refracts light and makes it hard to peer inside, gives off a golden aura, and much more. It is also never talked about compared to mars. Its also the morning/evening star, and the &quot;Lucifer&quot; mentioned in bible as well as venus. I&#39;ve read that in ancient civilizations, venus has been shown with a reddish gold tail that signifies some geologic disasters on earth like quakes and stuff, and is why its called &quot;Kali&quot; by hindus or has ties to other gods of destruction in other civilizations. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yea I know, the snake is just the snake, Lucifer is just Lucifer, and neither are the same as Satan. Lucifer is latin translation of phosphorus or bosphorus or something from the greek bible... in the bible its just the fallen angel or a disgraced Babylonian king I think.... only later was he grouped with satan and evil.</p>

<p>But yea, Venus and Lucifer are the same thing... that is what makes it more interesting to me. Venus is both the morning and evening star, tho sometimes they are referred to as different aspects in mythos. There is also the whole &quot;hermaphrodite&quot; bit ( having both male and female spiritual aspects) in lots of these hermetic/esoteric texts... and Venus represents that with both male and female mythic characters being attached to it. There is also the fact that the symbol for planet mercury is the same symbol as venus (the classic female symbol of circle and cross) but with horns.... so venus with horns is like Lucifer (I know Lucifer is not necessarily evil but you get what I mean)... the symbol of mercury would be a good representation of the &quot;male&quot; aspect of Venus... so its weird how that all connects. </p>

<p>I personally have a theory that some explosion on Venus caused meteors to land on earth, which introduced some important bacteria or fungus or something, as well as the element phosphorus... and this jump started evolution from prokaryotes to eukaryotes with mitochondria since phosphorus is key element for DNA backbone or ATP energy. </p>

<p>That is the more science/bio theory, but if you wanan go for more straight up ancient aliens... It could also be possible that Venus has alien life on it, and they sent a ship out to Earth to start terraforming and jump start life. Either cause venus was about to be destroyed or just cause they wanted to expand.... it may even be possible that alien life still exists on Venus, we can&#39;t really see into it because of the atmosphere cloaking it. It depends how much you believe from NASA about its temperature and atmosphere... I think only a few satellites ever got to land on Venus and they were Russian and melted within minutes, so proper data is very scarce. </p>

The individuals such a system would generate would surpass the best Humanity previously generated. It would be difficult for the gap between the masses and elite to remain - for all would possess the means to achieve greatness - Kings amongst Kings.</p>

<p>Former Christian, myself. Present...mmm, we agree on many (certainly not all) points.</p>

<p>I still wonder, though, hmm; shit, I might be an elite.</p>

<p>I profess, in silent, the nature of god... mmm, but I worry about sharing it.</p>

<p>I have thought, for some time, that there is good use in having two truths... a truth for the masses, THE truth for those whom it can be used toward the advancement, the upkeep of the whole operation; lies for the many, truth for some, toward the benefit of all.</p>

<p>What if that is our great filter, the answer to the Fermi Paradox; what if widespread knowledge of the truth causes us to cease our progression, what if it is our confused animal ways, in part, which drives us to create, to strive as we do?</p>

<p>Hmm, hmm, hmm.</p>

<p>Anyway, interesting share; Godspeed.</p>
