<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Shaked said :“Everyone has his own Judaism. In the nation-state bill, when it talks about a <strong>Jew, it means the nationality</strong>.” </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Oops... I thought Jew refers the faithful of Judaism, which was later bent by some Jews as a &quot;race&quot; (after it was exposed many so called &quot;Jews&quot; do not even believe in God). And now the term is once again a different thing altogether.</p>

<p>The Irony is ...</p>

<p>According to Rabbi Ron Isaacs <a href="http://www.capemaycountyherald.com/opinion/columns/article_c4b7e4c2-1299-11e8-a997-abc7b3c04ad3.html">&quot;What Is a Jew?&quot;</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>The Jews are not a race. There are dark Jews and blond, tall Jews and short. There are black African Jews from Ethiopia and African-American Jews in the United States.</p>

<p><strong>It would be equally misleading to speak of the Jews as a nation.</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Regardless, it&#39;s probably fair to say,</p>

<p>It&#39;s now <strong>ILLEGAL for AMERICANS to call themselves &quot;JEW&quot;</strong>. This rule is made by &quot;Jewish Authority&quot; from the land of milk and honey. It&#39;s therefore both God&#39;s (and the land&#39;s) Law.</p>

<p>Technically, only those who live in Israel can call themselves &quot;Jews&quot;? For example, you don&#39;t call yourself American if you are not a citizen of the U.S. vice versa.</p>

<li><p>Any human trait can cause you to be part of a minority. So that would count for the trait of being jewish, the trait of being white and even for the combination of traits that is being a white jew. So the answer is yes, as long as they are in a minority (some argue even a majority can qualify as a minority, but I think that is a rather semantically inept position) they can qualify as a minority.</p></li>

    <div class="md"><p>I know I shouldn&#39;t answer this question seriously, but I am more related to the field of social sciences than I would like to and I actually had a congres once, where a panel was discussing a very similar example. Long story short, it depends on who you ask. There are people that would argue that because left-handed people are at a disadvantage in society, because everything is built for right-handed people (sissors, nail clippers, even some lawn mowers!). And therefore they could be argued to have a disability in society. And thus they are a minority. </p>

<p>Disclaimer: this is not my opinion. My opinion would be: The question does not serve a purpose and is highly suggestive, so why don&#39;t you give your opinion instead of asking me questions and beating around the bush?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Okay, I may be wrong on this one but this is my rationale: for a human trait to be considered to be a minority trait in social science, the trait has to impact a groups social status or position in a relationship of power.

<p>Google? And “mainly” means not always. Your own quotes prove I’m right. </p>

<p>How about use common sense and critical thinking?</p>

<p>There’s many churches there. Christians attend these. Priests give mass. Where do you think they get the priests from? lol</p>

<p>Ok Jew. You seem to think only Jews live in Israel so you’re a Zionist. </p>

<p>And all you’re revealing is someone who uses google and YouTube to learn lol. </p>

<blockquote>

<p>Life experiences? So you have a Christian friend who got citizenship in Israel too? So you know someone in the ministry of absorption there as well? So you have a good handle of Arabic and Hebrew from going there like me?</p>

<p>Shit the guy just joined Reddit I’m tempted to give you his username so you will stop with this Jew nonsense.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Wait, you make a lot of assumptions about me. For no reason. I am Dutch and I live in the Netherlands. I am not Jewish, not Israelian, nor have I ever been to Israel. I am not a Jewish Thinker and all my questions were genuine. I am asking what the relevance of your post is, and I cannot see how you could deduct from the things you posted before, that it would be illegal under any law system, for people in the USA or elsewhere in the world (we have a great deal of portugese Jews in Amsterdam, where I live.) to call themselves Jews, without a certain heritage. As far as I know, the term Jew is not legally protected, just like the terms christianity and muslim. I do believe the term God is slightly protected but I should search through my law bundles for that one. </p>

<p>I have next to no opinion on the matter myself, so I am asking you: why should I care about this? While reading your post, all I could think was: Why would someone without any cultural or ethnical jewish heritage want to convert to Judaïsm or be called a Jew. </p>
