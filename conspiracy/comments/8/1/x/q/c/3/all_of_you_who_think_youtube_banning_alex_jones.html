<p>its&#39; NOT a 1A issue unless the government is specifically instructing which YT accounts be sanctioned and/or is enacting legal sanction/penalties for expressing an idea.</p>

<p>There are <strong>definitely</strong> similarities between YT and the bakery, but what the bakery did was <strong>NOT</strong> a 1A issue.  What the bakery did was a <strong>discrimination</strong> issue.</p>

<p>Its become very, very clear YT has not been applying their ToS equally.  As a private company, YT gets to do quite alot, and ToS&#39;es are written to very much favor the provider of a service, but ToS has to be applied equally.  This is going to blow up for YT, <del>bigly</del> <del><strong>bigly</strong></del> <strong>BIGLY</strong>, but it isn&#39;t a 1A issue.</p>

<p>lol. yet.  discovery could prove extreeeeemely interesting. if communications to YT are found wherein government officials acting in official government capacity focus on any political points-of-view...  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Bakery metaphor just does not work. Here is better. It may not work neither. It&#39;s just better.</p>

<hr/>

<p>In a town there is a cafe named &quot;Ideology X Coffee Shop&quot;. On the shop&#39;s door there is a text saying <em>&quot;This is the best place in town to share ideas about ideology X and have a cup of coffee at the same time. Please behave and respect others. Welcome!&quot;</em></p>

<p>One day a new customer walks in. Obviously this customer strongly supports ideology <strong>Y</strong>. The customer is not alone - there are couple of other Y-supporters who too come to this cafe everyday. But this new customer just can not behave. This person shouts and yells, throws  accusations, attacks others. Perhaps the text on the door went unnoticed.</p>

<p>Cafe owner is ideologically neutral but sees how the business declines: market share was backed up by X-customers who are now moving out, only because of one jerk who cannot or is not willing to read the text at the entrance.</p>

<p>The owner points out the text but eventually kicks out the troublemaker because nothing else seems to make the desired effect. Next day the heckler comes back and now the police is called.</p>

<p>&quot;You cannot kick me out just because I support ideology Y! It&#39;s against Amendment 1234! I need my effen soy vanilla latte!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;We are not kicking you out because of your ideology. You see, there are many Y-customers having some coffee&quot;, says the officer. &quot;We kick you out because you cannot behave. We protect owner&#39;s rights and I am obliged to secure the public safety of well-behaving citizens. It has nothing to do with Amendment 1234, but Rule 5678. Drink your coffee somewhere else.&quot;</p>

<p>Next week a brand new cafe is opened - it&#39;s run by Customer Y, the heckler. Cafe&#39;s name is &quot;Ideology Y Coffee Shop&quot;. On the door there is a text saying <em>&quot;This is the best place in town to share ideas about ideology Y and have a cup of coffee at the same time. Please behave and respect others. Welcome!&quot;</em></p>

<p>It&#39;s very, very small cafe. There are only two tables, but all Y-supporters who live in the town can fit in. They think it is the best place in the world. Soon it becomes the only cafe they visit and they tend to assume there is a strong general correlation between coffee drinking tradition and ideology Y. Their own experience acts as comprehensive proof...</p>

<p>Every day the police officer walks by these both cafes and is ready to protect both owners, all customers, laws and amendments. He&#39;s happy they are all coffee drinkers after all. And thank God those tea drinking ideology Z supporters were kicked back to Great Britain during the War of 1812.</p>

People who, as you would say, are average joes. And it&#39;s not like you just get your channel banned, it&#39;s everything. gmail, google+, everything. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don’t think it needs to be illegal or against thier rules for YouTube to deplatform people in order for it to be wrong. We need diverse voices in the public square or else the internet will become one big echo chamber. After a few years of only those with the “right” ideas having a platform, people will no longer understand opposing arguments. Those who push the boundary of acceptable speech will become outcasts and no one will listen to them, even when they are right. They will be seen as dangerous and laws prohibiting thier speech may be passed. Our society will become very intellectually unhealthy. Those who control the flow of information will control society, as it was in the days before the internet (only by degree has this changed). You can see how this moves things closer to totalitarianism. That is why we oppose people being deplatformed, and it is very much in line with the spirit of the first amendment of the US constitution.</p>

<p>Alphabet has received  <a href="https://subsidytracker.goodjobsfirst.org/prog.php?parent=alphabet-inc">$765,048,215</a> in subsidies, mostly from state governments it seems. I didn&#39;t look up any data on all the taxes they&#39;ve dodge though. </p>

Viewers can ALSO CHOOSE to stop watching a video, “dislike” and leave a very negative comment in the comment section. They can even FLAG and REPORT any video they deem offensive.</p>

They&#39;ve out-sourced something that would be illegal for the state to do to corporate gatekeepers. It weakens the power of the state and makes censorship an unregulated function of corporations.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This right here. I absolutely believe Alex Jones has a right to free speech. I don&#39;t like him because he sells his conspiracy talk to shill his snake oil vitamin crap. But he absolutely has a right to say and publish whatever he wants. But companies that do not wish to publish his content do not have to do so.  Advertisers are not obligated to continue funding him. If you&#39;ve ends up eventually deleting him, he will find a new home. Even if he has to start his own streaming service and charge a fee or something, here can still get his voice out there. This is not a first amendment issue, the govt has nothing to do with it. This is consumer driven.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Every media personality is &quot;playing a character&quot; to a degree. They can&#39;t be like how they are on camera 24/7. From what I&#39;ve seen/heard about Jones, he is pretty much &quot;Alex Jones&quot; 24/7. He&#39;s kind of a rediculous person to begin with. Hell, you can find videos of him from 20 years ago and he&#39;s pretty much the same guy just much thinner and younger looking.</p>

<p>Also, isn&#39;t this from his divorce? Dude was trying to get custody of his kids at the time, it sounds like he&#39;s willing to damage his career if it means he gets to see his kids more. That seems admirable to me.</p>

<p>I also think he&#39;s full of shit but he can be entertaining at times. It&#39;s scary how much people hate this guy. People wish so much ill will on him it&#39;s frightening.</p>

I just found your comment interesting in the current context, because I am inclined to field the same way about people who think Russian trolls and their masters are motivated by anything but money.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Many environmental blogs are written with the best of intentions, but many of them are click-bait ad revenue generators. There are certain topics which have a tendency to lead people towards blogs. We can&#39;t reasonably claim to know the intentions of this Internet Research Agency because it is entirely possible that their business model centers around identifying those topics which have a lot of activity on blogs and alternative media sources, and social media is the easiest way to lead people towards their various blogs. However, every supposed propaganda post that I see claimed to be Russian propaganda is just repeating something that other people already believed and were already writing about and making blogs about. True or false, people will operate semi-legitimate blogs which are intended to be genuinely agreeable to people who follow those issues on social media, even if the people curating the blog have no genuine interest in the topic. That doesn&#39;t make the information propaganda because they didn&#39;t necessarily care about changing minds. They weren&#39;t putting out some high quality product with carefully constructed lies, they were merely exploiting the natural internet activity of regular people to grab a fraction of that ad revenue. At least that&#39;s how it looks to me. If this was a propaganda influence campaign, they obviously didn&#39;t think it through very well. </p>
