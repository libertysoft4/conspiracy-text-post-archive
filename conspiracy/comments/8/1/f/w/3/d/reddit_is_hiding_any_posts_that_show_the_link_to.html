        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>So, this article (among others) came out today that showed leaked documents proving that Reddit has been manipulated by Russian troll farms.  In this article, the Daily Beast (I know but bare with me) obtained leaked documents showing that Reddit has been compromised.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/technology-43255285">http://www.bbc.com/news/technology-43255285</a></p>

<p>This article was posted multiple times on <a href="/r/news">/r/news</a>, but it is hidden every time for multiple hours so it won&#39;t collect any upvotes or downvotes.  </p>

<p>I believe Reddit is trying to hide the fact that they are actually compromised, just like Twitter and Facebook have already been proven to be.</p>

<p>The only place this has gotten any traction is <a href="/r/inthenews">/r/inthenews</a>,</p>

<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/inthenews/comments/81etlm/reddit_dragged_into_russian_propaganda_row/?submit_url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.bbc.com%2Fnews%2Ftechnology-43255285&amp;amp;already_submitted=true&amp;amp;submit_title=Reddit+dragged+into+Russian+propaganda+row">https://www.reddit.com/r/inthenews/comments/81etlm/reddit_dragged_into_russian_propaganda_row/?submit_url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.bbc.com%2Fnews%2Ftechnology-43255285&amp;amp;already_submitted=true&amp;amp;submit_title=Reddit+dragged+into+Russian+propaganda+row</a></p>

<p>which is a small subreddit that is not visited often.  They refuse to let this go to a bigger sub and that&#39;s why I brought it here.</p>

<p>We need to get this out and make Reddit respond to these claims.  They can&#39;t keep getting away with this.</p>

<p>Edit: </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This whole story is designed to censor the web and smear people as russian puppets.  Let&#39;s look at who has been smeared so far, there seems to be a common theme: Bernie, Jill Stein, BLM, Oil Pipe Line Protests, Trump... It&#39;s funny, there all non establishment movements (although I think Trump isn&#39;t an outsider anymore).  Then if you look at what these trolls were pushing, it was US MSM news articles, so it wasn&#39;t even Russian propaganda as it&#39;s being sold.  Remember when they smeared Donna Brazil for falling for Russian Propaganda because she was worried Hillary wasn&#39;t very healthy?  It&#39;s amazing they even claim that, like Russia was going around tripping Hillary and making her faint.  </p>

<p>This whole thing is being fabricated to censor the web, just like I think the Florida shooting is being used to attack conspiracy theorists.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, of course, this is nothing new, go check r/undelete... But what does it matter if some Russian trolls posted on reddit?  That&#39;s the point I speaking to.  There is the smearing that is going on and this call to hold Facebook / Twitter and now reddit responsibile for some Trolls posting on their sites, and if you look at what it was, the vast majority is MSM news articles.  This manufactured outrage is a joke and is going to be used to censor the web... Which has already started.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If it was as simple as the name implies, why aren&#39;t there stories about the noble US citizens, fighting back against Russian trolls on social media, during the election?

Doesnt seem like our current players are ever going to give the whole truth, but surely someone can. If not, the weaponizing of information just going to grow over the next 50 years.

<p>while Russia is clearly interfering</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That&#39;s not even clear. There is evidence that the company Mueller indicted was actually run by western intelligence as a <a href="https://www.larouchepub.com/other/2018/4508_mueller_indictments.html">false flag</a>:</p>

<p>&quot;The story of how the IRA came to be an infamous “Putin-controlled troll farm” in the narratives of Western intelligence is an old and long one. We can say, definitively, that it is rewarmed British gruel, a British lie as poisonous as Christopher Steele’s dirty dossier.</p>

<p>At the beginning of 2014, an anti-Russian group of hackers, initially called “The Anonymous International,” and later, “Shaltay-Boltay,” claimed that the building at Saint Petersburg, Savushkina 55, housed a troll farm run by the Kremlin.1 Since then, this building has been photographed and highlighted endlessly by MI6, all of the British press and tabloids, the CIA, the FBI, NATO, the BBC, the State Department’s propaganda departments and NGOs, CNN, and most of the rest of the mainstream American media. Infiltration operations have been run and publicized by the same people. Actions against the alleged IRA have been filed by infiltrators in the Russian courts. Any intelligent observer would ask the first obvious question: Why, if this building and the alleged company occupying it has been so repeatedly targeted by Western intelligence, would Putin be stupid enough to run an influence operation from that location targeting the 2016 elections? The answer should be obvious—he did not...</p>

<p>According to “The Saker” blog’s Russian account of the IRA,3 the company itself does not exist. It is a fiction created by Shaltay-Boltay, the successor to “Anonymous International” in conjunction with western intelligence agencies. Shaltay-Boltay, Russian for “Humpty-Dumpty,” conducted a systematic campaign of hacking, leaking, and extortion against Russian officials, according to accounts of its own activities published in the Guardian. Members of Shaltay-Boltay were arrested in November 2016 together with rogue Russian FSB officers said to control their activities. All were charged with treason by the Russian government, specifically some form of collaboration with the U.S.A. The British account of this affair, produced in the Feb. 9, 2017 Guardian, claims that the treason charges were based on the hackers and rogue FSB officials having confessed their trolling crimes to the CIA. According to a November 2017, Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty article, the FSB “cyber” division where the arrested officers worked, had been in collaboration with U.S. law enforcement agencies for years.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The voting on this thread looks manipulated. Sensationalists going along with MSM/DNC talking points as if Russian trolls had a significant amount of influence on the election and acting like Facebook and Twitter are &quot;compromised&quot; based on a pretty much still unproven claim of Russian manipulation. We have groups with suspicious funding claiming to have proof but the evidence is not really available to the public. Even the activity which is claimed by these groups is pretty insignificant. How do we even know the activity was politically motivated rather than financially motivated? Wouldn&#39;t Occam&#39;s razor say click-bait is just designed for ad revenue? They were just jumping into popular political discussions on both sides, which would be a perfect way to siphon off ad revenue from the internet frenzy surrounding the election.  </p>

<p>Meanwhile, you are sitting here pointing out quite correctly that his claim is overblown and not supported by even what the MSM is reporting. You are downvoted to -3 as of the time of my reply when the other guy is upvoted for an asinine comment &quot;you never heard about this??&quot; as if his personal sensational take on the situation was in fact a concrete verifiable event rather than a developing story that has so far not proven itself to have real legs.  </p>

<p>I&#39;m not saying I know for sure whats happening here or who&#39;s causing it, but in my opinion it looks fishy.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You seem to insinuate there is a conspiracy on Reddit to censor information or news that is critical of Donald Trump and/or links Russians &amp; Trump to campaign manipulation.</p>

<p>Since you are taking that position, I have to ask; do you have your head buried in the sand? </p>

<p>Seriously, what is wrong with you? It is so illogical to me for people, like yourself, to be so totally deluded and ignorant, I want to understand how it happens, why it happens. </p>

<p>It&#39;s like you are arguing there is no such thing as the sun. This type of ignorance is truly baffling to me. </p>

<p>The article you linked is terrible. I find it hard to believe this is being taken seriously, by anyone, as being verified enough to be called &quot;news&quot; and reported on.  </p>

<p>I have to ask......Why are you in a sub reddit title <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>, about conspiracy, posting what the government and MSM is stating as fact?</p>

<p>Why are you reporting US govmnt. &quot;news&quot; tat clearly bears the US three letter agency stamp of approval?  </p>

<p>Since when did the official narrative of the US GOVt. covert agencies and MSM become a conspiracy? </p>

<p>It is rather ironic, and personally frustrating for me when I point out to someone that believes the GOVT.&#39;s account of events on 9/11, that even the govt. narrative is a conspiracy, and they argue with me and call me an idiot. </p>

<p>Yet here you are posting govt. approved, MSM lies and propaganda that the same 9/11 believers I cite above would claim is a conspiracy. </p>

<p>The way the Government so easily, and powerfully manipulates and controls people like you and the 9/11 believers I cited above is truly disturbing. </p>

<p>Reddit, Twitter, Facebook, have not been compromised by anything other than The Owners, &quot;TPTB&quot;, &quot;Deep State,&quot; or whatever name you have for the elite powerful people that decide our fate. </p>

<p>You have fallen for it hook, line, and sinker......and you don&#39;t even realize it. </p>
