        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I find the fentanyl issue alarming due to the knowledge that the amount of fentanyl being produced is enough to kill 100&#39;s of millions of people, and the amount required for a supposed buzz is extremely small compared to heroin, etc.</p>

<p>Personal crazy theory: At first, someone is trying to push it in specifics drugs to either kill off hard users, or completely sell them fake shit that&#39;s tiny amounts of fentanyl that just gets them high. </p>

<p>The scarier theory I have is that someone is trying to stockpile enough to try a &quot;blitz&quot;, basically push it in a food/drink product, etc etc, beyond drugs, VERY QUICKLY, to try to kill as many people as possible.</p>

<p>Shit just doesn&#39;t add up either way, the only thing I could see is maybe it has an easier production cost and process and dealers want to sell tiny amounts of fentanyl mixed with baking soda or whatever so they don&#39;t have to get heroine, etc etc. </p>

<p>What is your opinion about this fentanyl issue?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Good question. </p>

<p>Why push a thoroughly toxic drug guaranteed to kill the user? It&#39;s the opposite strategy that a parasite would use, based on never kill the host from which you derive your sustenance.</p>

<p>I too am mystified by it.</p>

<p>I can only forward some unconfirmed hearsay that it is exported by China to the west for cheap; and that the Chinese care nothing for the death toll as long as there are profits to be made.</p>

<p>..... on reflection, not so different from many other destructive industries that litter the global landscape with bodies.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Because it makes all drugs taboo. You sprinkle a little Fentanyl on that and it will kill you.</p>

<p>Sure. There are drugs the WONT kill you. But unless you research these drugs you wouldnt know any better (LSD, pot...). </p>

<p>Think about Fent being added to coke. Polar opposites. Think about Fent being added to weed. of all things...</p>

<p>They just want to scare the black market they can&#39;t control.</p>

<p>This shit is bought cheap as fuck from China and such. Then they throw it in everything.</p>

<p>Lump sum is beneficial. TPTB make money because they are still gonna sell them. Those &quot;in charge&quot; look good for passing laws. Cops can still bust people for having them. The users go to private prisons. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>He&#39;s right.
The sad reality (as someone else mentioned) is that overdoses actually drive up demand.</p>

<p>Reason being, once word gets out about the overdoses, every other addict thinks they can handle what the now-deceased could not.
Unfortunately, this isn&#39;t the case when you&#39;re dealing with things like hotspots (improperly mixed fentanyl).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>They cut the heroine a lot with other non psychoactive additives and then add fentanyl so it becomes stronger And more appealing to users. The users don’t know there is barely any heroine in there. And just a grain can potentially kill someone, but they don’t add grains of it. My guess is they dissolve a batch of heroine, cut, and a tiny bit of fentanyl; mix it all up; dry it out; then sell it. Each bag has a fraction of a grain in it. Just enough to get people super fucked up and coming back for more. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Fentanyl is a godsend for cancer patients and the terminally ill, its many times more potent than heroin in its pain relieving capacity so obviously the market for abuse is commensurate. Dealers often use a little fentanyl to start an overdose scare ie this dealer has some pure heroin when it&#39;s actually laced with fent </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Are you joking? People put it in heroin to make it stronger. If you put it in heroin then you can cut the heroin even more and make even more money. No is really like I want to but fentanyl, but if you just add it to some cut and call it heroin people want to buy it. Most people using it don’t know they are using it and most people that use it don’t die. The problem is when it gets mixed in either in too high a concentration or unevenly so that some bags are too high of a dose. Dealers are very careful to not do this because they do not want to kill off customers. They want them coming back with more money. Unfortunately most of the people doing this are not PhDs so mistakes happen, that’s why you hear about it on the news. The vast majority is used without death or even notice. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>They aren&#39;t trying to kill the user. Fentanyl does 2 things to heroin. It makes it cheaper and makes it stronger for the dealers. While all dealers will tell you they don&#39;t want people dying from their product, they will all tell you that business booms when people OD from it. They will also say that because most of the Fent made is from some illegal operation in Mexico or China or India, the strength of it isn&#39;t always known. The same amount one week could be stronger or weaker the next week so it is a crapshoot on how much they put in there. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I used to &quot;work&quot; for a guy in Seattle that cooked the stuff in his apartment.</p>

<p>It is incredibly easy to synthesize with the right equipment and chemistry background. Most of the precursors can be bought domestically aside from one or two that are sold in China but can be imported.</p>

<p>And the whole &quot;mixing fent with other drugs to kill the customers&quot; is a myth. Fent is usually only mixed with opiates and sometimes benzos in order to potentiate or mimic the effects of the drug.</p>

<p>What you aren&#39;t realizing is that there is a huge population of people that want opiates but hate the stigma/taste/etc. of heroin.
And now that oxy has skyrocketed in price, fent provides an alternative to those who want to stay away from heroin.</p>

<p>I could go on forever about the market, why bad batches happen, etc. but this comment will probably get buried at this point.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, concerning the market, a large majority of my customers were either pretty affluent and respectable. You did get some characters that gave off the stereotypical &quot;junkie&quot; appearance, but for the most part the people that he&#39;d always meet up with dressed nicely and had rich parents or good jobs.</p>

<p>Seattle is notorious for locking up doctors over prescribing even reasonable amounts of painkillers, so most of the pharmaceuticals are either counterfeit or imported. 
Regardless of their origin, they are incredibly expensive, and some people refuse to do heroin so the fentanyl option allowed them to still get high but within their &quot;moral&quot; parameters.</p>

<p>Plus, it is often cut with natural sweeteners so it doesn&#39;t taste terrible when smoked, and is so potent that it doesn&#39;t require intravenous use.</p>

<p>However, that does not mean that it isn&#39;t dangerous.
One particular risk I ran into often were &quot;hot-spots&quot;. Basically, when you mix the two precursors to make fent, it is so strong that if you are even in the same room without PPE, you can pass out or die
(Related reading: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moscow_theater_hostage_crisis">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moscow_theater_hostage_crisis</a>)...
That means if you don&#39;t cut your product down considerably AND consistently, then you end up with areas that are stronger than the rest. Which is incredibly scary because you could be fine for the first half of your bag, but that last hit was 100x stronger than the rest and you fallout over an amount you normally could handle.</p>
