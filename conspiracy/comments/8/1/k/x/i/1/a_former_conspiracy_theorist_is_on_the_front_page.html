<p>When asked about theories, etc - he side stepped any examples of REAL conspiracy and just said &quot;Milli Vanilli&quot; - guy is obviously some kind of scientific fundamentalist/atheist trying to shit on things he doesn&#39;t have the time for anymore &quot;since he has so much money from his entry level job and psychiatrist&quot;.</p>

<p>Obviously not all conspiracies are true, but who is saying that? However, if you think that literally ALL conspiracies are bullshit, then you need an incredible reality check, while it is very likely your naivety has reached levels yet unimaginable. </p>

<p>The very wiki of this sub has a list of proven conspiracies and that list is <em>vast</em>.</p>

<p>Threads like that AMA just boggle my mind. It just makes me lose some hope for the human race...it&#39;s unfathomable really how dumb and sheepish people can be. It&#39;s just unbelievable.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah love all the armchair psychologists stroking their chins and saying things like “conspiracy theorists are really just trying to make sense and order the world. They’re probably unhappy with their lives so they like to think it’s because people are trying to keep them down etc etc”</p>

<p>When people say things like that I think of the Aldous Huxley quote that goes something like “we’ll teach them to love their servitude”</p>

<p>Personally, I think it’s more insane to believe that wealthy dynastic families who still marry to consolidate wealth and power wouldn’t work towards staying wealthy and powerful. It would actually be crazier to think they weren’t. Isn’t it pragmatic and logical from their perspective hold onto what they have and if possible accumulate more? No, apparently it’s delusional to think that. If you believe you’re a “sceptic” because you believe the official narrative without question then surely that’s actual crazy to automatically assume that side is telling the truth because they’ve told you they’re the authority. Questioning something based on available evidence doesn’t mean you’re mad or stupid especially when it’s often in the elite’s own words in the form of reports and books from think tanks, policy groups.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What is the argument? I read parts of the thread briefly and it seems that the argument is that conspiracy theorists are victims who blame outside forces for their own failures. If that’s the case the. I can say I’m all too aware that any failure in my life is of my own doing. I don’t consider myself to be a victim of anything but my own choices.</p>

<p>There’s enough evidence out there for people to come to the conclusion that the elite are out for themselves. I don’t agree that people believe the wealthy want to hold onto their wealth. Maybe in some abstract concept they agree but once names are given to the people with the money and the power people will shut down. They’ll believe that companies are greedy but think family dynasties are a fiction.</p>

<p>Of course if you believe in something without proof based on what you feel to be true that’s a silly position to take. It’s equally silly to dismiss evidence because you don’t believe that people might work together against the masses. I’m not sure the argument to which you’re referring. I was just trying to point out a lot of the arguments made against conspiracy theorists is based on some patronising idea that were shaking our fists to the heavens because we have a victim mentality of the world conspiring to keep humanity down. Shouldn’t the mentality of always wanting to trust authority and dismiss questioning the off the official narrative be equally mocked? It’s only ever conspiracy theorists who are called morons etc</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think he&#39;s referring to how much value the guy places on identifying as an atheist. Anyway, there&#39;s nothing wrong with it. I used to call myself one, but I wasn&#39;t satisfied with the idea that were just a cosmic Big Bang accident in an infinite universe with no significance. I continued doing research with the same intensity as before and now I&#39;ve dropped the label and no longer believe that there is no God. Just everything relating to sacred geometry suggested to me some kind of inherent mathematical guide, the result of a directed intelligence. Then I realized NASA is lying to us and I dropped most of the western beliefs about science that I was taught. Looking back, as an American, I was taught the scientific method, but if they tell you what you can and can&#39;t investigate, then that isn&#39;t science, that&#39;s Science (from authority). Anyway, my point is that if you consider yourself an atheist because you&#39;re basing your beliefs on the findings of modern western thought, then please keep researching. You&#39;re not done.</p>

If it is on a topic that goes against something they&#39;re working on, then they won&#39;t just ignore it, but will try to destroy your reputation as not credible or not a real scientist. Then you&#39;ve got all these debates from lay people on whether the person&#39;s research is significant, mostly because one half takes them at face value and the other half is influenced by the personal attacks to see the original researcher as a &quot;pseudoscientist.&quot;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The reconstructed autonym *Slověninъ is usually considered a derivation from slovo (&quot;word&quot;), originally denoting &quot;people who speak (the same language),&quot; i. e. people who understand each other, in contrast to the Slavic word denoting German people, namely němьcь, meaning &quot;silent, mute people&quot; (from Slavic *němъ &quot;mute, mumbling&quot;). The word slovo (&quot;word&quot;) and the related slava (&quot;glory, fame&quot;) and slukh (&quot;hearing&quot;) originate from the Proto-Indo-European root *ḱlew- (&quot;be spoken of, glory&quot;), cognate with Ancient Greek κλέος (kléos &quot;fame&quot;), whence comes the name Pericles, Latin clueo (&quot;be called&quot;), and English loud.</p>

<p>In other news, did you know that the Gaelic language is actually a form of early homosexual cant, like a medieval polari? We know this because it is a compound of two words: gae, meaning gay of course, and lic or lich, which means tongue or language.</p>

<p>Your class status does not determine your ability to think.</p>

<p>Everyone must sustain themselves or they become malignant draws on everything around them.</p>

<p>You can be a materialist demi-god in this world and having nothing but robotic emptiness behind your eyes and unthinking competitive routine or be a well rounded, mindful exemplar human being.</p>

<p>Eventually mindless consumptive comfort becomes consent for all of the machinations of power brokers you never consider while you climb your own sliding ladder.</p>

<p>Making capacity of thought and subscription to belief boil down to by-product of social status is a boring, well worn cliche.</p>

<p>Everybody should be responsible for their own rudimentary existence.</p>

<p>People make fun of conspiracy theorists because they make a lot of  assumptions about things they can&#39;t know.</p>

<p>People in the thread themselves make a lot of assumptions about something they know nearly nothing about.</p>

<p>With stuff like wikileaks and the very obvious spying on citizens going on, I find it very frightening that people still think that the government would ever do something malicious to them. Gulf of Tunkin? Syphilis tests on Blacks without their consent? No, never happened.</p>

<p>It&#39;s a testament to the success of the brainwashing machinery, Edward Bernays would&#39;ve been so proud. But what do I know, I&#39;m just a retarded conspiracy theorist.</p>

<p>In 1984 (ive only seen the movie) the TV literally watches/listens in on the protagonist. To the point where if he wants to do anything he has to blast his TV&#39;s volume and hide in a corner where it can&#39;t see him.</p>
