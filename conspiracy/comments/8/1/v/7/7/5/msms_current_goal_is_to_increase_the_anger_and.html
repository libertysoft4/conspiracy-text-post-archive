        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>anger and fear is negative energy. Negative entities feed on negative energy. Opening people to negative energy makes it easier to manipulate them. The fear in Germany before WWII allowed the Nazis to come to power. This has happened numerous times throughout history.</p>

<p>If watching MSM programs on TV makes you angry at the lies and deception they are spouting, good, it means your soul is not atrophied or gone.</p>

<p>If you allow your anger to manifest into negative energy that is not dealt with, this is bad. Channel this negativity into positivity by engaging in &#39;self activities&#39;. These are activities that empower your true self, allowing you to convert negative energy into positive energy. Some of my self activities are running, meditation, camping, and playing computer games.</p>

<p>If you do not convert this negative energy into positive energy it will start to take you over. DO NOT LET THIS HAPPEN. Too much negative energy exposes you to great risk. 
The nefarious groups controlling the MSM know about this and have been actively manipulating it for decades.</p>

<p>Try to minimize exposure to negative energy and increase your self awareness so that you can know when you are being influenced and controlled by negative energy. You can still use negative energy, just don&#39;t let it control you. It is not bad to use negative energy, just be aware of it.</p>

<p>Positive energy increases your ability to exercise free will. In contrast, negative energy enslaves you. </p>

<p>Smoking cigarettes is a good metaphor for when negative energy takes over. Cigarettes are great, I personally really enjoy the energy, concentration, social aspects,  and ritual of smoking a cigarette. However, being addicted to smoking reduces my free will, lowers self esteem, and of course, is bad for my health. </p>

<p>When you experience something beautiful, it is something that you must share with others. When you experience pain, it is a burden that you alone can bear. The experience of pain cannot be shared, other than by inflicting it upon others. I think this idea came from Kant.</p>

<p>This all may sound very Star Wars, but it is very true.  The most obvious and easy way to demonstrate this is by reflecting on your own subjective experience of beauty and pain, what they have made you do and what it was like expressing your experiences of beauty and pain to others.</p>

<p>If you need more validation there is a lot of validation out there, bring it up in the comments and maybe some one will throw ya somethin that works for you.</p>

<p>My intent in writing this post was not to get into the philosophy and existential shit, but rather to communicate a message. The message is:</p>

<p>&quot;DO NOT LET NEGATIVE ENERGY CONTROL YOU. WORK TO BECOME MORE SELF AWARE&quot;</p>

<p>We are at a critical juncture in the human timeline. Whether or not we become a species of good or bad is determined by this one thing RIGHT HERE AND RIGHT NOW.</p>

<p>The message is also a call to action.</p>

<p>edit: It is never too late. If you think you have been consumed by negativity for too long, and it is impossible to change, you are wrong. It only takes one concentrated thought or decision to set in motion a chain reaction of positivity. </p>

<p>Re social change: Most people don&#39;t realize that the critical mass of support required to make radical change in society is only something like &lt;10% of the population. So if positive energy is literally contagious and it only takes 10% of the population, it really only takes a small dedicated group to get going.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>A few years after eliminating  television,radio magazines &amp; mainstream websites.....it&#39;s remarkable how much more relaxed I have become. My viewpoints are more my own as well.</p>

<p>I recommend it to anyone who is interested in feeling better.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Good on ya. I intentionally exposed myself to as much life as I could in the last decade including a lot of positive and negative experiences. Sometimes 
I specifically went looking for negative experiences. It&#39;s kind of messed up, but I saw them as personal growth experiences. Sometimes I would go so far as to go to bar&#39;s and say offensive things to big guys with big ego&#39;s knowing they were going to beat my ass. I never put up a fight. </p>

<p>Although I now value those experiences for the immense insight, strength, and knowledge, there were several years where I was consumed by negativity and had no self control. Now I&#39;ve come out on the other side a better person for it, but I was lucky. </p>

<p>Sorry for the rant, the thing I meant to convey is that whereas you sound like you did the prudent thing in limiting your exposure to negative energy, I did the opposite and it worked for me. The point is, we all have our own means of self discovery and growth that our unique to us. I truly value all of the people I have met who have discovered their own self&#39;s and viewpoints.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Man, you hit the nail on the head with me. I was angry speaking to my dad earlier trying to convince him of all the things he’s been lied to as a baby boomer and it was negative energy and we came to agree to disagree on stuff but he said I shouldn’t be getting upset about what’s out of my control whether or not these conspiracy theories are true.</p>

<p>I also quit buying packs up cigarettes and offer a dollar to anyone who can bum me one but only 20% of people take it... I went from smoking a pack a day to only 2-3 cigarettes a day... I’m trying to fully quit in a month but like you said the ritual of a cigarette is good.. just not in chain smoking quantities </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I had a similar realization about two years ago, and that is...don&#39;t spend energy being negative. You only have so much energy in a given day, so why waste it on worry, angry, fear, etc?  </p>

<p>Everyone has to feel these negative things sometimes, and thats important because of balance. But focusing on negative things leads to a negative mindset, and a negative mindset can take years off your life!</p>

<p>Thanks for posting this</p>
