        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Anyone ever been to St. Thomas in the Virgin Islands?  If so, did anyone go venturing around Great St. James Island, or Little St. James Island?</p>

<p>You know its owned by Jeffrey Epstein?  They call it pedophile island.</p>

<p>I&#39;m doing some research for a new movie, and was wondering about the security on the island, for creative purposes.</p>

<p>How hard would it be to swim over to Little St. James?  It&#39;s not far at all from neighboring islands, and if you had a boat, that would make it a lot easier.  Anyone tried?</p>

<p>After the gunman came in shooting at Comet Ping Pong pizza parlor over pizzagate, they&#39;ve gotta be thinking about these types of things.  How locked down is it, or could it possibly be?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Nah the way to go would be  SCUBA in from a reasonable distance preferably leaving your boat anchored behind a neighboring island to break line of sight. Bring a spare Oxygen tank for the return trip. </p>

<p>Have a ghillie suit and some sort of cooled underlayer to defeat thermal cameras (if Little Saint James is where people like Bill Clinton go for their illegal jollies it would have state of the art security) in fact a waterproof thermal camera of your own to detect hidden guards and to decide on an ideal point to hit the shore (im sure some easy beach landing points would be monitored) and of course a high-end telescopic lens camera to document whatever you may find. Maybe a Taser, pepper spray and rope/duct tape as well, </p>

<p>All of that equipment should be able to be brought in a waterproof backpack or duffel bag of some sort</p>

<p>if your in an encounter your only option would be to incapacitate the guards as long as possible and make a quick getaway even then if you are detected they likely have access to monitoring techniques that would allow you to be easily tracked down even after you have escaped.</p>

<p>So in conclusion with some James Bond level preparation and planning you may be able to get on the island undetected, from there its unknown what level of security they have but ideally you would be able to find hidden perches and monitor areas of interest such as the underground tunnel entrance and the temple, you may have to monitor each area for hours at a time so compressed food bars (4000 calories in a package the size of a brick) and drinking water would likely be necessary.</p>

<p>Entering any of the locations would mean a very high risk of death or prosecution and imprisonment.</p>

<p>So best case scenario you could snap some photos of some VIPs roaming the island or maybe even some children being transported (unlikely as they would be in covered trucks or otherwise concealed, its not like they would have them in the back of a pick up truck) maybe you could get some new views of the occultic temple, possibly some shots of the inside but all in all you wouldnt be able to really gather anything of Criminal Significance without sneaking into the actual structures which again would have a 90% chance of death or imprisonment.</p>

<p>And even if you did manage to get files or hard evidence it would inadmissible in court</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Nope.</p>

<p>Best way would be to rent a sailboat or catamaran and sail over, purposefully sloppy...  if accosted, you are a dumb tourist who doesn’t know what you are doing.</p>

<p>This requires you learn how to actually sail.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Um, we were taking about methods assuming he already made it to the main island.  I am saying how to get to the Epstein one.  Dunno how much it costs to rent a catamaran there, but most beach places in the US rent them for a day for a few hundred dollars.  But really, the funds aren’t my concern, just the method.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve spent some time on St. Thomas. You can easily boat to Little Saint James, though I&#39;m not sure about what kind of security you might run into if you tried to land. There is none visible from the water when you boat near it, but I don&#39;t know what you would expect? Like guntowers or cannons? My guess is there are cameras and armed security guards keeping an eye on the place.</p>

<p>It&#39;s too far to swim, plus there are major shipping lanes that cross between St. Thomas and the St. James islands which present a hazard.</p>

<p>All beaches on St. Thomas are open to the public. Closest launch areas would be Secret Harbor which has a small dock if you have your own boat, or Sapphire  Beach which has a more extensive dock. The Ritz sits nearby too, but I don&#39;t recall them having launch facilities, plus they&#39;re under major reconstruction right now - the hurricanes took their roof off. I&#39;m almost certain there&#39;s boat rentals at Sapphire where you can commission someone to take you out to look around. If not there, then you can definitely find that service in Red Hook.</p>
