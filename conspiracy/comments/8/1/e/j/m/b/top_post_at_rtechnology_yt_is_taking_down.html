<p>Also, the Seth Rich leak has already been bastardized into a right wing vs left wing conspiracy theory, so you can&#39;t even bring it up without causing anger and partisanship.</p>

<p>The real conspiracy we all collectively should be focusing on is the Federal Reserve, international banks, and the petrodollar... About as bipartisan as you can get, because they are fucking every single one of us.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It’s not necessarily a pro censorship argument. It’s more of a “how do we get rid of flat planet and reptilian theories” question, and using the Seth rich incident as just one of many conspiracies that we should learn about and be aware of. Lumping the flat planet/reptilian theories together with other far more valid ones like fed reserve, 9/11, dnc/Seth rich, etc. is a convenient way to discredit those that actually matter—which worries me. </p>

<p>I initially thought censorship was a good way to get rid of these, but have been convinced otherwise due to the conversation on this thread. Unlike most people on this website I am able to think with reason and am happy to change my mind if I am wrong. With that said, I still don’t see a solution to this problem if censorship isn’t the answer. I’m too impatient to deal with flat planet proponents and David icke type Guys. Science disproves flat planet theory consistently, and the reptilian thing is so beyond—I can’t even believe people think there is an ounce of substance to this shit. </p>

<p>I could say the same thing about kids looking up to pseudoscientists like Neil Degrass Tyson and Bill Nye the &quot;science&quot; guy.  They actually claim that they are authority figures on the subject say and it could be dangerous to not listen to them about their dogmas they push.     </p>

<p>I&#39;m pretty sure the attitude that you have is what is making them more stupid.  Listening to peoples opinion/ideas, doing your own research and making your mind up for yourself is how you learn.  </p>

<p>You want to ban a subject like FE that you have never even personally researched or studied.  Now how stupid is that? </p>

<p>Are you sure he has tested and proven theories to be facts?  Do you have any examples?  From what I see he is a government spokesperson who pushes agendas and other scientism dogmas that can not be proven with experiment and evidence.  </p>

<blockquote>

<p>You are the perfect example of brainwashing.  The &quot;science authority figure&quot; vs &quot;the stupid basketball player&quot;, just like the mainstream media designed it.  You do realize that many people (myself included) had been researching the subject for 2-3 years before Kyrie had ever even heard of the topic?  So trying to tie anyone that questions the spinning ball theory to Kyrie Irving and the &quot;stupid basketball player&quot; archetype just shows how easily you are manipulated and unable to think for yourself.  </p>

<p>&quot;If there is something that will make conspiracy theorist think they are right, it&#39;s shutting down their ability to be wrong.&quot;</p>

<p>I actually completely agree with this (in some instances, obviously). The marketplace of free ideas should regulate which ideas are good or bad. If a conspiracy theorist can&#39;t back up their claims, then let their theory be dismantled by counter-evidence and reason. If someone doesn&#39;t like a conspiracy theory, but can&#39;t challenge the evidence put forward, then that&#39;s just censorship to get other people not to see it.</p>

<p>This whole &quot;we know what&#39;s best for you&quot; approach that YouTube is taking will be the death of them, no question.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Every time a Democrat wins the presidency, gun sales go through the roof. For that reason I think the NRA and gun companies have funded Democrat candidates campaigns covertly. Even if the Dem politician supports gun control, they know there will never be any real impact on their industry because even if sales are restricted from a Democrat law, it gives the industry even more of a boom when people stock up and hoard even more guns after a law is passed. If some gun nut has 20 guns and a Democrat is elected president, he&#39;ll buy 20 more guns. Why would gun manufacturers ever want a Republican politician to win?</p>

<p>YouTube is a government supported monopoly providing a platform for mass communication that no other company can provide because of the fact YouTube is a government sponsored monopoly. In case of an emergency or some other tumultuous event, they provide critical communication services that cannot be found anywhere else. It&#39;s status as a &quot;private company&quot; is a sham perpetrated to allow themselves and the government to circumvent all kinds of restrictions and regulations that would otherwise be placed on the platform and associated technology were it properly classified as a government sponsored monopoly.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I completely agree with you, but I still don&#39;t feel that censorship is the answer. Again, the issue there is much bigger than lack of censorship, it&#39;s societal.</p>

<p>Also, the Seth Rich leak has already been bastardized into a right wing vs left wing conspiracy theory, so you can&#39;t even bring it up without causing anger and partisanship.</p>

<p>The real conspiracy we all collectively should be focusing on is the Federal Reserve, international banks, and the petrodollar... About as bipartisan as you can get, because they are fucking every single one of us.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It’s not necessarily a pro censorship argument. It’s more of a “how do we get rid of flat planet and reptilian theories” question, and using the Seth rich incident as just one of many conspiracies that we should learn about and be aware of. Lumping the flat planet/reptilian theories together with other far more valid ones like fed reserve, 9/11, dnc/Seth rich, etc. is a convenient way to discredit those that actually matter—which worries me. </p>

<p>I initially thought censorship was a good way to get rid of these, but have been convinced otherwise due to the conversation on this thread. Unlike most people on this website I am able to think with reason and am happy to change my mind if I am wrong. With that said, I still don’t see a solution to this problem if censorship isn’t the answer. I’m too impatient to deal with flat planet proponents and David icke type Guys. Science disproves flat planet theory consistently, and the reptilian thing is so beyond—I can’t even believe people think there is an ounce of substance to this shit. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks. It&#39;s gonna be my canned response for awhile anytime this issue pops up. I&#39;ve tried to make this point before a few times, usually in the form of questions to anybody who would know the legal implications better than I. I&#39;ve gotten zero traction until today posting it here. First time it&#39;s been voted above +2 and nobody has even bothered trying to answer me at all when I put it in the form of a question. Imagine my surprise, here I thought it would be a great conversation starter. Anyway, have a good weekend all. </p>
