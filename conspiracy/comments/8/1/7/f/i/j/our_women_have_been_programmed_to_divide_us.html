    <div class="md"><p>Thanks for your reactions.
I am happy that this article shocked you enough to run out of arguments and fall straight to the leftist level of ad hominem. It is a good news that no-one here had any factual argument against this, showing that your answer is emotional and not rational. But also showing the feminine mindset that has been programmed in your brain. Anyway.
You call me incel, and you are so far from reality. I know PUAs well, very well. I read Neil Strauss, Vox, Chateau, watched Tyler, etc. I hanged out with dozens of so called PUAs and MGTOW. Yet, 99% of them are single, sad, and without children. Factually, if we call evolution to remove the weaks, then these people are part of it. That is strange, right?
Of course  you can downvote me as a sign of feminine emotional reaction, but that won&#39;t change facts.
Feminism has destroyed the family unit, yes. The natural order of things is the family, and having children. Your child can&#39;t be healthy without his father at home, that is also a scientific fact. Listen to Molyneux, he treated very well the subject.
PUAs and MGTOW are just the opposite side of the same coin that is called feminism. It is a female ideology, not a manly one. It is a left ideology, not a right one. And it is a liberal ideology, not a conservative one. It is no surprise that inside groups like RSD you find many immigrants and leftists.
Now, let&#39;s push it further. In a near future, as Vox already believes, the mass immigration in the us and europe will lead to war. Muslims do make children, and a lot. How do you planned fighting if your focus is to pick-up women? Why would you even fight if you think that family and having children doesn&#39;t matter? And if we already all old without children, who&#39;s gonna fight for our genes, our culture? These questions, you ain&#39;t gonna answer your &quot;own way&quot;, but collectively. You won&#39;t be able to defend yourself if we don&#39;t control our women.
Finally, I see someone saying that all of that ain&#39;t conspiracy. Again, how could you be so much in denial and uninformed? All media, hollywood, etc. Are controlled by the same people. Didn&#39;t you understand it during Trump&#39;s campaign, at least? It is a conspiracy, the biggest of history actually. And you jump two feets in it like an innocent care bare. </p>

<p>Guys, please take care of you and start being united to face our real issues. We need to hold and fight like brothers and not to argue and downvote each other like women. </p>
