        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Hi,</p>

<p>Peace to all of you and I am not looking for an argument, only for a logical reason behind why the pope has chosen to be a freemason.</p>

<p>I am a firm believer of Jesus Christ, I had an encounter with him near death. I believe he is God and I am not here for a religious debate. </p>

<p>Like many of you, the bible talks about a NWO (New World Order) that will come into effect. It is obvious that the pope has a part to play in this but I have a couple of questions. </p>

<p>The devil will be defeated in the end, so I am confused to why the pope is a &#39;pope&#39; and a SATANIC FREEMASON. How can he believe that the devil will win when he is serving God. It is written that darkness will be defeated. It is a complete contradiction and I am really interested into what is going on in his head. </p>

<p>I understand most of you dislike religion and I respect that. However, you can follow Jesus and not be religious. There is a difference and I can completely see how religion can be used to control the masses.</p>

<p>This might be the wrong section of Reddit to post in but I feel I can&#39;t post this in R/Christianity as the catholics would get very angry.</p>

<p>I just want to add that I do not condone catholicism and I believe it is a false doctrine.</p>

<p>Freemasons, family dynasties/cabals, Jesuits, Vatican etc; they can&#39;t all be working together and they definitely can&#39;t all be manipulating eachother so somewhere one of these theories are wrong.</p>

<p>Catholic canon also specifically prohibits freemason association (vecause diesm) going way back; so if anything they&#39;re enemies.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;d like to see the actual Latin if possible. The building I don&#39;t have much to say on but it is in bad taste: actually a lot of church design in the 70s/80s  were. Iirc it was supposed to be reminiscent of a nuclear end that was all the rage those days.</p>

<p>And the pedophilia is an institutional thing? Cause I&#39;m pretty sure it&#39;s you&#39;re average percentage found in other occupations like teachers and such. Unfortunately pedos will take advantage of any opportunity. I would perhaps assent that these pedos are protecting eachother. It goes along with prophecy etc.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Catholicism teaches practices that are non biblical. Crossing yourself, praying to mother Mary, confessions, even the Pope himself are just some examples none being greater than this one though; they don’t teach that the only way to heaven is through Jesus. </p>

<p>The Bible is very clear on how to get to heaven and spend eternity in paradise, by accepting Jesus into your life and asking and receiving the forgiveness and believing that Jesus died for our sins and rose again, but, Catholicism teaches that good works can get you into heaven. That is so anti biblical on so many levels that there are literally bible verses (Eph. 2:8-9, Titus 3:5, Galatians 2:16)that disprove the statement that good works will get you into heaven. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>They made the bible. </p>

<p>The respect given to Mary and the Saints are different than the worship reserved for god; if you think we love Mary too much imagine how much Jesus did. There is also no worship present in the Hail Mary if you read it; it&#39;s biblical. The distictions of these levels are actually called Latria, dulia and Hyperdulia.</p>

<p>Apostolic succession is super important since Jesus gave Peter His authority to &quot;feed his sheep&quot; and to loose and bind on heaven and earth. This authority has been passed through the popes and unto the priests who perform these sacraments; such as confession.</p>

<p>That once saved always saved stuff is nonsense; one needs to continually improve in faith AND works because the way in narrow. Yes Christ is the way and he is literally present in the Eucharist at church like he said in John 6.</p>

<p>And I argue that one can&#39;t truly accept Jesus without equally good/multiplying fruits as shown by the withered fig tree and parable of the talents.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>well that&#39;s partially true.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Actually they didn’t “make the Bible”. The Bible was given to us by God as his word. </p>

<p>Loving Mary is not what I was saying. It is fine to Love Mary but, worshiping and praying to her is sacrilegious according to the Bible as a false idol. Also, Jesus loves everyone the same as  everyone else, unconditionally. He sees no one person higher or lower than the other because all fall short of the Glory of God. </p>

<p>Jesus gave Peter that right to spread the Bible and spread the word. Catholicism has twisted this into many wrong things. Everyone has a personal relationship with God the father and everyone can personally pray to God as the Bible says. There is no need for a Pope, priest, Bishop, cardinal, anything. All you need is  prayer and you can directly communicate with the Father. Why do you have to confess to a earthly figure when you can confess and ask for forgiveness from God himself directly? </p>

<p>If you don’t believe in “once saved always saved” then you are literally saying you don’t believe in the Bible. </p>

<p>John said “The Son of Man must be lifted up, that everyone who believes in him may have eternal life. For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life. For God did not send his Son into the world to condemn the world, but to save the world through him. Whoever believes in him is not condemned, but whoever does not believe stands condemned already because he has not believed in the name of God&#39;s one and only Son.” John 3 15-17</p>

<p>And Jesus later went on to say” I give them eternal life, and they shall never perish; no one can snatch them out of my hand. My Father, who has given them to me, is greater than all; no one can snatch them out of my Father&#39;s hand. I and the Father are one.&quot;  John 10:28-30</p>

<p>You are admitting that you don’t believe in the Biblical teachings at that point which, according to the Bible, means your beliefs are wrong because they are non biblical. You supported my side in your argument. </p>

<p>Jesus said “I am the way the truth and the light. No one comes to the Father except through me”</p>

<p>I pray that this opens your mind and helps you understand the deception that the Catholic Religion has made. </p>

</blockquote>

<p>Though I share your skepticism about the Catholic Church, just wanted to make a note here on Jerome. When he translated the Vulgate in the 4th century, it was from the Koine Greek copies circulating in the East, where Greek was the lingua franca. In the West, Latin was the more dominant language, not only among citizens but also in the provinces (though local languages were also still spoken). If anything, Jerome made the Bible more available to people than it was before.</p>

<p>as for paedofilia which is often actually ritual child abuse,  Tjeerd Andringa, prof of cognitive sciences at the uni of groningen had this to say:</p>

<p>&quot;Psychopathy is only mildly hereditary, so an elite psychopath cannot guarantee that sons or daughters will be just as psychopathic. I expect this entails that they need a steady resupply of ruthless and power hungry individuals who understand the world deeply and pervasively and, as such, are highly capable. Normally, deep and pervasive understanding leads to to wisdom and a sense of responsibility, humility even. But that is precisely not what the kakistokracy needs; it needs the same depth and pervasiveness of understanding, but in combination with utter ruthlessness and the capacity to appear respectable.</p>

<p>Enter child abuse. By abusing children you &quot;give&quot; them an attachment disorder by violating or destroying the deep sense of security that is the basis for an open attitude towards learning and discovering. With this trust violated the child&#39;s world changes from a world of opportunities to a world of potential and actual threats. And often they will search and serve those who can protect them from these threats and in doing so giving their autonomy away for life ... Aristocrats and priests must have discovered a long time ago that abused children lead to useful adult servants; slaves actually. And while this is despicable to people with normal moral development, it is a positive thing for psychopaths who see other people as tools anyway.</p>

<p>Yet this does not solve the problem of keeping the kakistocracy supplied with respectable appearing, super high functioning and completely ruthless psychopaths. ...<br/>
Enter child abuse again. If you organize events for the ambitious and capable in which they progressively can show that, notwithstanding their veneer of respectability, they are actually completely ruthless, you have the ideal recruiting grounds for the kakistocracy. Of course blackmail plays a role, but the suitable candidates gladly let themselves to become blackmailable because this gives them access to the inner sanctum of the kakistocracy: they proof themselves worthy members and loyal (due to their blackmailability) and in return they will receive access to power in a way they could never dream of on their own. After a while they become fully accepted at a level that suits their capabilities and they will help to maintain a system that gave them so much opportunities (and can end their respectability at any point in time).&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well first i&#39;d direct you to John chapter 6. That whole chapter is an expose on the institution of the Eucharist. Jesus literally says &quot;this is my body which will be given up for you, eat of it&quot; same with his blood. I need to stress that he was entirely literal; which is why the apostle mentions it &quot;was a difficult teaching and many left because of it.&quot;</p>

<p>So we have that; the mass is a reenactment of Cavalry through the authority of the priest to appease God. (As Christ is a perfect sacrificial lamb and though a drop of his blood would redeem humanity he gave it all) the supper is then shared with the congregation that we may literally be in communion with Christ (I in you, you in me)</p>

<p>Now the importance of this ritual is the tradition it&#39;s based in; Passover. The Jews of the day would gather at temple and the priest would put all their sin symbolically onto an actual sacrificial lamb/scapegoat which was then sent away or killed idk.</p>

<p>The point is that the mass is a fulfillment of the old testament Passover where Christ is the sacrifice for us.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The original tennants of Christianity were an inversion of the theology that came before it. Basically there is God #1, who created to universe and is the reason for the universe&#39;s fundamental forces; then there is God #2, who is all life in the universe existing in constant, ever changing variation. One day God #1 decided to shine favor on his child, God #2, and in doing so gave a portion of God #2 a portion of God #1&#39;s power. The result of this action resulted in Mankind, who are children of God #2 but able to bypass his will by doing God #1 stuff.</p>

<p>Obviously this made God #2 super jealous of Mankind, because Mankind is kind of like the unruly son that is able to defy the father (original sin). Christianity serves God #2 and pretends that the God #1 powers that Mankind has (science, art, music, language, etc) actually come from &quot;Satan&quot;. They then twisted the story so that God #2 and God #1 became indistinguishable, and that Satan defied God.</p>

<p>In reality, God #2 is the actually evil dude. He hates mankind and he hates that we can transcend our biological selves. He wants to get rid of us but he can&#39;t because we&#39;re a part of him. Basically God #2 encouraged us to form tribes (which happens when your group produces more mouths than it can feed), which is where the whole notion of child sacrifice comes in. The smallest Tribe that best curses humanity gains most the favor of God #2, and as long as that tribe works to keep Mankind in the dark or deprive us of our God #1 powers that tribe stays on top via supernatural means.</p>

<p>In Christianity, the clergy knew all of this, but did not breed and thereby didn&#39;t participate with God #2 in the &quot;ever changing variation&quot; sense. The serfs constituted the majority of mankind being cursed by God #2, and the nobility formed the tribe that enacted the will of God #2. Everybody played a role.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ll take the bait :)</p>

<p>Essentially, the view I have taken of &#39;theories of personality&#39;, such as those of Marx, Christianity, Freud, Pavlov, Nietzsche and many others, is not that all, or all but one, are wrong, but on the contrary that all are correct. I was, and am still, unable to escape the implications of the fact that each of the theorists in question was, after all, concerned with one and the same human being. Instead of rejecting all such views, I found myself essentially rejecting none. This shift of emphasis is, I believe, crucial. The task is changed from one of selection to one of assembly.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I also recommend the book, &quot;From Sabbath to Sunday,&quot; by Samuel Bacchiocchi. The RCC itself proclaimed it to be valid church history, and Mr. Bacchiocchi studied in the Vatican Vaults themselves! It shows how the church constructed a new religion through synctretism with existent religious cultures in Rome. For instance, the statue of Mother Mary with baby Jesus was precisely the same as the statur of Horus and mother Isis. Another example was marching the army through a river, declaring them baptized, and instituting a Sunday morning prayer. All soldiers would march towards the rising sun while saying the same prayer with their own god&#39;s name in key places. That way all soldiers were conditioned to see all their gods as the same god.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have to be the bearer of bad news but the Catholic Church is not following Christ or his teachings. Here are but a few examples of the false doctrine of the Church.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>A saint is someone who is following Christ.  Not someone who&#39;s been ordained as such after they die.</p></li>
<li><p>The idea of confessing to a priest is Old Testament.  Christians confess to Jesus only.  In private.  Catholic Confession is a guilt and control mechanism</p></li>
<li><p>Purgatory is an outright lie that is not supported by the Bible</p></li>
<li><p>The practice of baptizing babies is not Biblical. </p></li>
<li><p>Worshiping the saints (as defined by Catholicism) is idol worship</p></li>

    <div class="md"><p>Dude a saint is a being in heaven you can&#39;t be more wrong. So Christians and heaven and even angels are all saints; Mary top ranking. I have no idea where you got your definition from.</p>

<p>Catholic confession is based on the authority of the priest to forgive sins (that which is loosed on earth/in heaven) invested to Peter by Jesus: specifically to the end that he create the church to continue His ministry (of forgiving sins, healing etc.) And most apostles told their churches to confess to even one another so your guilt mechanism is put of the window.</p>

<p>It&#39;s kind of presumptuous to think you can forgive your own sins by saying what&#39;s basically a prayer.</p>

<p>And it&#39;s funny you say worshipping the saints as defined by catholicism when in fact we don&#39;t even  use that word I. Reference to saints.</p>

<p>I am so sick of ignorant protestants pretending they know dick about scripture or history. Somehow riding their high horse despite being part of a divided house; devoid of any sacraments sans baptism and ignorant of the rich philosophy, theology and tradition that is their heritage.</p>

<p>You haven&#39;t argued any of my points man. Just said but they did bad things.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes exactly.  Both popes and many others in the Vatican are Jesuits. They&#39;ve infiltrated all the secret societies and know exactly what&#39;s going on. They always play both sides and are calling how the game is played. They&#39;re a clever and loyal group. Doesn&#39;t take much research to figure it out.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well first i&#39;d direct you to John chapter 6. That whole chapter is an expose on the institution of the Eucharist. Jesus literally says &quot;this is my body which will be given up for you, eat of it&quot; same with his blood. I need to stress that he was entirely literal; which is why the apostle mentions it &quot;was a difficult teaching and many left because of it.&quot;</p>

<p>So we have that; the mass is a reenactment of Cavalry through the authority of the priest to appease God. (As Christ is a perfect sacrificial lamb and though a drop of his blood would redeem humanity he gave it all) the supper is then shared with the congregation that we may literally be in communion with Christ (I in you, you in me)</p>

<p>Now the importance of this ritual is the tradition it&#39;s based in; Passover. The Jews of the day would gather at temple and the priest would put all their sin symbolically onto an actual sacrificial lamb/scapegoat which was then sent away or killed idk.</p>

<p>The point is that the mass is a fulfillment of the old testament Passover where Christ is the sacrifice for us.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I also recommend the book, &quot;From Sabbath to Sunday,&quot; by Samuel Bacchiocchi. The RCC itself proclaimed it to be valid church history, and Mr. Bacchiocchi studied in the Vatican Vaults themselves! It shows how the church constructed a new religion through synctretism with existent religious cultures in Rome. For instance, the statue of Mother Mary with baby Jesus was precisely the same as the statur of Horus and mother Isis. Another example was marching the army through a river, declaring them baptized, and instituting a Sunday morning prayer. All soldiers would march towards the rising sun while saying the same prayer with their own god&#39;s name in key places. That way all soldiers were conditioned to see all their gods as the same god.</p>
