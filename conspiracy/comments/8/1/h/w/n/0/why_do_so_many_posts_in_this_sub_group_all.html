<p>&quot;Sidetrack opponents with name calling and ridicule. This is also known as the primary ‘attack the messenger’ ploy, though other methods qualify as variants of that approach. Associate opponents with unpopular titles such as ‘kooks’, ‘right-wing’, ‘liberal’, ‘left-wing’, ‘terrorists’, ‘conspiracy buffs’, ‘radicals’, ‘militia’, ‘racists’, ‘religious fanatics’, ‘sexual deviates’, and so forth. This makes others shrink from support out of fear of gaining the same label, and you avoid dealing with issues...&quot;</p>

I had assumed in a conspiracy sub a lot more people would be inclined to believe that the two party system is fake, and a way of pushing and pulling on issues to make people think that &quot;their&quot; side is fighting for them, meanwhile deep state goals are always moving forward:</p>

Your projection is really telling. I&#39;m not going to put much effort into this response because I have no reason to believe you&#39;re looking for an honest discussion. Don&#39;t worry, you can say whatever false and misleading things to and about me that you want, most likely I won&#39;t bother to respond to you.</p>

<p>[–]varemia 2 points 21 hours ago 
He&#39;s saying it isn&#39;t a one sided issue, so projection makes zero sense. We have emails of Democrats taking cues from big pharma from those massive leaks everyone keeps forgetting.</p>

<p>Both left and right politicians are bought and sold by the massive pharma lobby. They&#39;re at the top of every donor list.</p>

<p>What&#39;s funny is how your comment almost seems cookie-cutter, in that it doesn&#39;t address any specifics, and seems to be automatic in nature.</p>
