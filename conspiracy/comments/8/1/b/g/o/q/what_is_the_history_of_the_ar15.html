    <div class="md"><p>You are being incredibly hyperbolic in an attempt to push your agenda. I beleive that US citizens should be armed as the Constitution calls for. Obviously this doesn&#39;t include Nuclear Weapons but it definitely includes AR-15&#39;s and assault rifles. The People are the final check against Tyranny. Take a step back and realize what you are honestly calling for- disarmament of the People, who are the only source of legitimacy for the government.</p>

<p>The People <em>must</em> be armed. </p>

<p>Because that would mean destroying their home territory, which the government obviously wants to control.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>That&#39;s not really their choice. Once their citizens revolt, the soldier recruitment pool dries up, and revenue disappears, there is not State.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You can not pick and choose like you say. So your way of thinking is hypocritical and naive</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Lol the entire species would be better off not having Nukes, but they exist. They should only be in the hands of governments who are democratically elected so that they are in control of the People. It is dangerous to everyone to make even a single additional Nuke. Again, your false equivalencies are terribad. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Go all in or except society as is and except that laws can change and should change throughout time to benefit society.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Lol you think that because everyone shouldn&#39;t have nukes no one should have funs? You are incredibly naive. As I said, small arms ensure the <em>People</em> remain in control something you have ignored in every single response you have given me. You seek an unarmed populace and unchecked government power. You seek the destruction of a Free Republic, and you don&#39;t even see it lol. </p>

<p>Have fun in your fantasy land where Nuclear weapons somehow equal AR-15&#39;s lol. </p>

<p>Bullshit. Americans have had the right to bear arms since the beginning, yet the ultimate power rests in the hands of the government. No measly assault rifle ever stopped government tyranny in the US.</p>

<p>The only thing that possession of such weapons has caused is citizens being killed en mass by other citizens, while the government sits back and laughs.</p>

<p>Not one government act was ever stopped by a citizen with an assault rifle. In fact such citizens have felt the worst kind of tyranny.</p>

<p>Ask the kids at Waco whether their guns protected them from government tyranny. Oh, that&#39;s right.... you can&#39;t.</p>

<p>Why not?</p>

<p>Seriously, what is the logical argument you use to state that American citizens right to possess some arms is inviolable but for other arms is not?</p>

<p>Why do they have the right to own an assault rifle but not a nuclear bomb?</p>

<p>How can you justify banning the ownership of one type of weapon, but not another?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The AR-15 is not.  It was originally designed for civilian use.  When it didn&#39;t sell, he made it full-auto, redesignated it M-16, and sold it to the military.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, from what I can find, Armalite created the AR-15 as a military weapon, but it didn&#39;t sell.  They sold the design to Colt, who used the design for the creation of the M-16.</p>

<p>Later, Colt revived the AR-15 design and designation, and sold them to police units.  Then, eventually, civilians.</p>

<p>Also, Colt&#39;s patent expired in the 70s, and that allowed a bunch of AR-15 knockoffs. </p>
