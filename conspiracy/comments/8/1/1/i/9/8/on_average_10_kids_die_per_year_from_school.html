    <div class="md"><p>Exactly this is what I can’t understand from the other side. No question school shootings are a thing. When columbine happened I was in school, I really didn’t believe it’d happen at my school. It just seemed like a rare occurance.</p>

<p>Now with threats every week. Shootings happening everywhere, minor or not minor.
That child accidentally shooting them selves, that teenager that killed his whole family then himself. These are shootings as well guys. What’s the culprit the damn gun! </p>

<p>Put it this way, I know evil will happen anywhere and everywhere. You ban guns ppl will “find a way” the issue here is why not make it harder than to go to Walmart, get a gun and ammo for “hunting”. Then bring it to school or wherever. Shootings arent only happening in schools. But damn if I were in school now I’d be very hesitant to go. Bc a school shootings seems way more likely than a “rare occurrence” nowa days.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah really man. I hate this way of thinking and hate being associated as an American</p>

<p>Yeah so what kids are getting shot. People are dying everywhere.</p>

<p>Kids drown so ban swimming pools?
Car accidents happen so ban cars?</p>

<p>Lol no not at all, these things are accidents and these things happen.</p>

<p>When you go to school, or scope out concerts to make sure you can efficiently kill as many ppl as you want. That’s not an accident and completely different. So they have “mental issues” and those shootings are “rare” bc many ppl have guns and won’t go shooting. I get that and you are right.</p>

<p>But when all Americans have the right to a gun that can kill a person. Do you really believe everyone should have a right to a gun? Bc there have been fucked up people and they aren’t “rare” as you would think and I’d be more on the side of it’s more common that these fucked ppl exist than rare.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Any child&#39;d death is a tragedy of course.  But should we ban swimming pools because and ban kids from lakes, rivers and beaches because uou are something like 10x as likely to die of drowning than by firearm.  And that includes accident, suicide and homicide.</p>

<p>What we need is people to be smarter caring for their kids.  And to realize accidents happen even to the children of the most careful and smart parent.</p>

<p>We can wrap them in a nerf world at home, maybe but once out the door they are at more risk to things we cannot control like the #1 killer - cars.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>But you set protective factors around those things. And guns are implicitly designed to destroy things. So, imo, there needs to be some sort of change due to how dangerous they can be. Shit, i dont even live there but 1300 kids is 1300 to many. And i dont know what can be done, but an attitude of &quot;well kids drown and we dont or shouldn&#39;t ban water&quot; is inane to me.</p>

That’s not at all what I’ve been saying which seems to trigger everyone on the other side. No matter what I say.</p>

<p>What I’m sayin is just like drownings, just like kidnappings, just like car accidents we all set preventative measures in place. Regardless of “statistics” we know death is not good and we make sure to try to prevent it best we can.</p>

<p>When the Las Vegas shooter buys 20+ guns in a year span, and has 40+ guns at his home that he obtained all legally. Maybe something should have been looked into? Mental history? Depression, history of violent behaviors? Idk I don’t have all the answers what I do feel is that instead of just banning criminals and medical mmj holders, there can be more done. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah and you get downvotes. It’s amazing man. 1300 kids die from school shootings but well look at car accidents and drownings and compare them the same? Amazing.</p>

<p>I don’t think the other side will ever realize until it happens to them, it’s sad and I wouldn’t hope it but it’s true. If your child involved in a school shooting you’d ask these questions whether you support guns or not.</p>

<p>Where did he get the gun? Oh Walmart 
He got it so easily?
He had depression and anger issues? Why did we sell him the fucking gun. Oh I forgot American. Lax background checks 
Why did he do it? Just bc he felt like it</p>

<p><em>thinks to self</em> Ugh yeah maybe we should start changing the laws on gun control. </p>

<p>I mean I saw some ppl already taking apart their guns and dismantling them. It’s a start. Please don’t tell me you need 20+ guns for protection. You need one if that.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yep and drownings we encourage life vest(preventative measure)</p>

<p>We teach our children not to talk to strangers (preventative measure)</p>

<p>Accidents once again sigh - stricter dui laws, seatbelt laws, cell phone laws. You know preventative measures to slow down the rate of accidents</p>

<p>We aren’t saying they are fullproof but again each of those things we take preventative measures, but once again for some reason no preventative measures can be done for guns..</p>

<p>Can’t look at history, our background checks are doing “fine”, people collect guns so what if he has 30+ guns, you can’t look at my medical history!, so what if I’m on psychotropic drugs and I’m depressed! I’m American and I have every right to a gun, but again a mmj medical card holder; in the eyes of the government are unfit to carry..</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yep, and accidents are typically more easily prevented than are intentional acts. Sadly, if someone wants to kill a lot of people, they are probably going to be able to. However, in this most recent shooting, I think it can and should have been prevented. The FBI and the police both failed those kids pretty massively, and something should absolutely be done to prevent those kinds of failings from happening in the future.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>A lot can be prevented. If we can get away from the mentality of “every American should have a gun it’s our rights, you cannot strip my rights!” It’d be a little easier.</p>

<p>I wish we can somehow access mental records, even medical issues/medications for background checks as well as stricter laws. Don’t make it so accessible. I don’t know about you but I really shutter at the thought everyone should have a man killing machine, it’s their right. I believe there are some fucked up ppl and a lot of them. To rationally be on their side bc they are American is foolish.</p>

<p>I still don’t even see why people collect guns. These aren’t stamps, or coins. Yes if your child gets in their they can kill themselves. Not eat/lose a coin. But that’s how we treat guns like toys. That’s our mindset, but they are man killing machines. 1 bullet can kill a man or really cause injury. But ehh, gotta keep hunting deer for my family, and protect myself “everywhere I go”..</p>

<p>I believe one gun per household. And only indoors. If your caught bringing it out, other than for hunting cuz Americans love hunting and we can’t lose that right. Than it should be a fine.</p>

<p>If your “protecting” yourself in public with your gun, doesn’t that sound dangerous having a shootout in public? </p>

<p>I think its unrealistic to ever expect that to happen. I understand not allowing people who have made clear threats from owning a gun (as in this most recent case), but for your average law abiding citizen, it just won&#39;t happen. We see it as a human right, and of course you know that right is protected in our Constitution.</p>

<p>I get that you don&#39;t understand why people don&#39;t like to own guns, but of course that doesn&#39;t really matter. I like my guns because I enjoy going to the range, I like the peace of mind, one of my ancestors (Capt. Benjamin Merrill) was a famous gunsmith, and because I just think they are cool.</p>

<p>You may think its ridiculous, but I like the peace of mind of owning my guns, and having my secluded vacation property, just in case shit ever hits the fan.</p>

<p>It does, and I hope it never comes to that. But I&#39;d rather be able to defend myself than not. I like to have my life in my own hands. You know what I mean?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It does makes sense that a school shooting will always grab way more attention then anything else mentioned above. And it&#39;s amplified by an infinite number if you have kids and you see these news stories.
As a Canadian I don&#39;t think a lot of Americans realize that if you wanted to shoot up a school here with an automatic gun you can do so, you just need more time/knowledge. In Ontario the course only takes 2 days then you wait around 3 months for your certificate, then you send that with a bunch of forms to the RCMP and if you pass the background check you should have your unrestricted and restricted license in 3-6 months. Then with a little bit of machine shop knowledge you can easily turn &quot;assault&quot; rifle with a 5 round magazine into a fully automatic gun. I think it simply a matter of mental health and population. The US has around 320 million people. Canada around 36 million. If 1% are fukin crazy then it&#39;s 3.2 million vs. 360 thousand. Gun control just means future lunatics have to wait longer. Providing they don&#39;t have a previous criminal record. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Lunatics have been lashing out violently for probably all of human history.  Imagine if the narrative being aggressively pushed right now swaps &quot;ban those Assault Machine Guns because this this and this event used them&quot; with something like &quot;We need better gunlaw enforcement to prevent mentally unstable people from obtaining any gun because this this this this this this and this school shooting and almost all other non-school related mass shootings involved some type of clinical mental instability&quot;, you would be a fool to argue with this premise at the high level.  I can see arguing what defines mental instability, but hey we could actually have a chance for compromise once civil people discuss the detail.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah you know when our fathers who wrote the constitution. Stating the right to bare arms. Well you know their guns were way less efficient in killing, shooting muskets at someone that (did more damage by infection and other things) than actually killing the person. Their guns were not semi or automatic, there were steps to firing just one bullet.</p>

<p>Now you can fire 1000s or rounds in a few moments. That’s pretty scary and each of these bullets are improved technology. They can burst inside the body, they can burst right on contact, etc etc. </p>

<p>When our founding fathers said we have a right to carry guns. They had something much different in mind than what we have today. I think a lot of ppl misunderstand and just take a gun for a gun. Their guns and technology were much different.</p>

<p>Before one person with a barely accurate musket could barely take out a group of ppl(he would need to take time to reload, set the gun up, the gun was barely even accurate from close range, etc rtc).
Now one single man whenever he felt like it can put hundreds of ppl at their mercy. Shit the vegas shooter had thousands of ppl at his mercy.</p>

<p>What worries me the most is what if like minded individuals got together with some training. A group of 5 trained individuals can take out thousands of ppl. But hey we have to protect everyone’s rights.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hey sorry I wasn’t really clear. My point was that the Las Vegas shooter had thousands of ppl at his mercy. That was just “one” person as far as we know.</p>

<p>My point is what would stop future shooters to come together for even worse bloodshed. If one person can cause so much damage, can’t imagine like 3-5 ppl.</p>

<p>I think it doesn’t occur bc ppl don’t coordinate. But if we are on the trend now with planned shootings I can only imagine in due time we will see coordinated attacks, that will be much worse than what we’ve already seen.</p>

<p>With these threats coming in more common now. I mean even high school kids can get together and plan this shit. Instead of one school shooter what if they plan more?</p>

<p>I’m only saying that it’s scary to think of what the gun allows one man to do let alone a group. It scares me to the core to think all ppl need to do is coordinate and we can have a massacre we’ve never seen before.</p>

<p>Imagine our media and politicians screaming about a formalized federal background check database and laws to ensure felons and known high-risk kids and adults get in the system.  That is stuff all logical people can get behind, maybe skeptical but actually feasible.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well when it’s not as easy to obtain a gun. Or if we actually check mental history or current psychotropic medications and things like that, we could actually be preventative.</p>

<p>What is not going to change is by saying everything is fine! Car accidents happen, shootings happen, drownings happen. Yep they sure do, what do we have in place ? Preventative measures to prevent ppl from dying.
Airbags, life vest, heavier dui penalties.</p>

<p>For some reason with guns, “there’s nothing we can prevent, shootings will happen just like car accidents or drowning” 
Well with that mindset nothing will change and shootings are no doubt becoming more n more rampant. People getting caught before actually going with it, threats are being made, it’s becoming common now. To say there’s “nothing” we can do is just like saying “hey that life vest won’t help the baby drowning, nothing we can do, things like that happen”</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I never ever said there is nothing we can do.  If you asked me straight up I would suggest considering:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Escalate existing gun law enforcement and accountability for failure to enforce gun laws</p></li>
<li><p><em>Lightly consider</em>, dont mean to turn you off, and using scary words: warranted gun confiscation by courts for felons and high risk individuals (like a flakka drug outburst but not felonious, you cant be trusted with a gun sorry). Im talking cops searching homes and taking all weapons and ammunition.  Just an idea I thought of, dont mean to cause a ruckus.</p></li>
<li><p>Make official a national background check system, IT IS not fully deployed my pro-gun friends. I believe this is rational, especially given todays tech not a big cost and instant point of sale like most States today. Evidence is in the mass shootings we&#39;ve endured. This is not a gun registration, I oppose gun registration. </p></li>
<li><p>Mandatory Doctor reporting for significantly high risk mentally unstable patients.  Again, I believe it is rational, evidence is in mass shootings we&#39;ve endured.</p></li>
<li><p>Holding parents responsible for securing guns at home.  No excuses for accidents, child suicides, and child murderers accessing firearms.  Parents, you cant just cry and tell us he was going to be an astronaut. No, you&#39;re going to sit there in court and tell us why you didnt lock up your weapons and ammo.</p></li>
<li><p>18-21 year old purchasers must have parent / guardian approval and be present during the purchase to confirm (we hope the parent/guardian fears their kid is messed up). A compromise specific to School based mass shootings. 18 years olds are adults legally, so this is a tough one that removes a Right, this is why I labeled it a compromise.</p></li>
<li><p>Federal anti-bully law optimization, protection from those who are bullied and defend themselves.  </p></li>
<li><p>Social media policing for bullying, giving those who are bullied help. </p></li>
<li><p>Social media policing for child gun violence, this would also benefit gang related violence</p></li>
<li><p>To help with drunk driving deaths (which nearly matches gun murders), DUI = no gun purchases 2 years, multiple DUI or DUI manslaughter = gun confiscation possibly or atleast no guns allowed for life bitches.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>These are ideas I formulated independently over time and now.  There are more out there to add to this list; that don&#39;t involve undermining the 2nd.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I want to know why there were 4 fucking deputies that sat and listened to the shooting taking place and didn’t do a fucking thing to stop him. Everyone is on this take our guns bullshit instead. It’s not how many died, it’s how many could have been fucking saved if those 4 sworn protectors would have done their damn job! And the sheriff blaming guns on national tv knowing his guys failed at every level only to be called out days later. The sheriff and 4 deputies should be put on trial and held to the fire on this one. Also, last time I checked, murder of any kind with any weapon is already banned! So, when you fix the incompetent law enforcement and their response time and rid the USA of evil people You would have a lot more on board. Until then, I’ll hang on to my guns. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>There is no real foundation to the argument, it is seriously high school debate class, where you must chose a side and die defending it, there is no middle ground, there is no room to agree on any single point.</p>

<p>They needed 9/11 to happen to make the Patriot Act happen, we see now how useless it is.  With the law enforcement fails in the recent FL event, you cant help but wonder if it is an inside job, possibly like a 9/11 to usher through a legit gun ban.  </p>

<p>With the internet and free access to information (thanks again America), the only thing that will happen is a civil war because the excuse to smash our Rights is so Goddamn logically lame.</p>

<p>Bad shit has already come and is being pushed by both parties, it&#39;s almost like the Third Party is the People and more specifically gun owners.  All these neo-Liberals are like a school of bratty children, you just want to smack the shit out of them but they are just kids so you dont.  Dont worry children, the Adults will figure this mess out, just stay out of the way, thanks!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>A lot can be prevented. If we can get away from the mentality of “every American should have a gun it’s our rights, you cannot strip my rights!” It’d be a little easier.</p>

<p>I wish we can somehow access mental records, even medical issues/medications for background checks as well as stricter laws. Don’t make it so accessible. I don’t know about you but I really shutter at the thought everyone should have a man killing machine, it’s their right. I believe there are some fucked up ppl and a lot of them. To rationally be on their side bc they are American is foolish.</p>

<p>I still don’t even see why people collect guns. These aren’t stamps, or coins. Yes if your child gets in their they can kill themselves. Not eat/lose a coin. But that’s how we treat guns like toys. That’s our mindset, but they are man killing machines. 1 bullet can kill a man or really cause injury. But ehh, gotta keep hunting deer for my family, and protect myself “everywhere I go”..</p>

<p>I believe one gun per household. And only indoors. If your caught bringing it out, other than for hunting cuz Americans love hunting and we can’t lose that right. Than it should be a fine.</p>

<p>If your “protecting” yourself in public with your gun, doesn’t that sound dangerous having a shootout in public? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Bloody you seem like a very reasonable person. We both disagree but you give me your own personal opinions and what it does for you. You also do bring up points for the other side. But also are aware of the issues we are bringing up for gun control.</p>

<p>Thank you for that. If both sides can rationally speak, not get offended and really see where each other is coming from, a middle ground should be able to be found.</p>

<p>We both agree things can be prevented, or something should change to limit it, but also keep it reasonable.</p>

<p>Cheers.</p>
