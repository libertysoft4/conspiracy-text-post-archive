<p>The police sherif, faculty, students, parents. I don&#39;t really watch the news - only YouTube clips, but there are an insane number of videos out there interviewing all of these people. They&#39;re all extroverted public speakers, well spoken and not too nervous.</p>

<p>I hardly know anyone who could experience a traumatic event, and instantly be thrown into the ring of CNN and FOX without an issue. Yet this community is filled with them.</p>

<p>On the other hand... Maybe they don&#39;t publish the interviews that aren&#39;t smooth and don&#39;t provide a good story. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>A 1000 isn&#39;t much. The high school I went to also had a 1000 kids, under the same circumstance we would have been a bunch of babbling idiots (entire grad class knew each other). However in our country we aren&#39;t as obsessed with the media, maybe kids in the US are more comfortable with it?</p>

<p>I think the whole situation seems weird due to the amount of production value behind the videos. Look at the CNN Town Hall video, it&#39;s odd. I picture millions of people mindlessly plugged into this Orwellian looking news coverage. </p>

<p>-MSM goes all out on gun control before any actual investigation.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s actually part of this. Youre going to tell me it&#39;s a coincidence that out of 1,000 students, the media has &quot;organically&quot; focused on 4 or 5 kids who are staunchly anti-gun? Where are the pro-gun students?? Where are the students who report second shooters or an uptick in security (even Secret Service) leading up to the shooting?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Seems to me like a combination.  A couple, David Hogg specifically, seemed to put himself forward.  A couple the media found because they were in close proximity to the shooter during the incident.  A couple seem to have been kinda picked by the students involved with this, at least the ones who were speakers at the rally in Tallahassee.</p>

<p>The second shooter hasn&#39;t been confirmed by anyone yet.  Often after tragedies, you&#39;ll hear unusual stories from shocked victims.  I vividly remember the MSM reporting one such story about a man who survived the WTC tower collapse by surfing down on top of a piece of debris.  I&#39;m not saying that the second shooter testimonies are wrong, just that as of now, they are unconfirmed.  As more proof around that is discovered, eventually documentaries will be made, and those things will circulate, just like 9/11 or Waco conspiracy documentaries.</p>

<p>There are absolutely pro-gun students who went to Parkland.  While I&#39;d agree that the media are not purposely seeking them out in order to give them equal time, and they should, they didn&#39;t completely ignore them either.  I&#39;ve seen interviews on MSNBC with a couple, and several more who agree with increased background checks, but stop short of favoring Assault Weapons bans.  I don&#39;t watch CNN, so I can&#39;t comment on their coverage, other than to highlight the pro-gun student who was supposed to give a question at the Marco Rubio Town Hall, and the whole shitshow with his father fabricating emails in order to help push the anti-CNN agenda.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m all for shooting for sport. Note: I&#39;m not the guy who you were originally talking to. I just thought I&#39;d chime in when you said &quot;hunting&quot; as if it wasn&#39;t killing.<br/>
All things aside, the gun is literally a tool that was built for the sole purpose of killing. That can&#39;t be denied. But guns are already a thing. They exist, and have come for hundreds of years. I believe every mentally- healthy adult should have the right to own a gun, and I also believe they should have the right to use that gun as an absolute last resort to stop violence against their person, or against a tyrannical government.<br/>
I&#39;m a liberal. In the literal sense, that is, that I believe everyone is entitled to the freedom to do what they want without the restrictions of control by another party. But at the same time I believe there should be some serious education courses that go hand in hand with the purchase of any gun. I only believe in hunting if one actually hunts for food, rather than for sport. I also think target shooting and clay shooting is totally cool. It&#39;s a complex issue, and so I don&#39;t think it has a simple answer. I don&#39;t think guns are inherently the problem, but I won&#39;t deny that their existence and accessibility play a role in the larger problem, as does mental health treatment and education. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Check out Maddy Wilford. Something stinks about that. </p>

<p>SWAT apparently applied a chest seal to her, which Coral Springs FD Lieutenant Ojeda believes alleviated the symptoms of a punctured lung.</p>

<p>Three days later, she&#39;s photographed with Trump, and doesn&#39;t even seem to have an IV, or chest tube. Four days after that she&#39;s released from the hospital. Less than a week later, she&#39;s walking around doing interviews. And next week she can go back to school. </p>

<p>After having a lung punctured by a bullet. </p>

They have no respect for the victims or for the gravity of the subject. They&#39;re loving their 15 minutes of fame and acting like reality TV stars. </p>

<p>If any of them truly witnessed or experienced a real school shooting they have quickly got over it and are standing on the bodies of the supposedly dead classmates to further their careers. Sick liberal fucks.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I remember CNN doing a segment from the HS students&#39; bus on their way to the town hall meeting.</p>

<p>Many students obviously did not want CNN on the bus with them doing live segments while on the way to the event. You could see and hear their exasperation.   I saw it live, but wasnt able to bring up clips of it just now. They may have gotten rid of it as it made CNN look like agressive trolls preying on young kids.</p>

<p>WTF was CNN doing on the bus harassing HS students after the trauma they went through?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is more so what I&#39;m thinking. I&#39;m sure the attack happened and the kids are real - but CNN simply makes it look fake / staged / off. The production value, the weird interviews, the obsession with it all.</p>

<p>When I watch it I feel disgusted. Looks like some dystopian future. Like a movie or book. Not real life... </p>

<p>And why is CNN pushing it so hard? I doubt CNN cares about gun reform, I&#39;m sure they only care about the views. </p>
