<p>Here&#39;s a quick quote, &quot;Conclusion
The Waco incident was the worst disaster
in the history of federal law enforcement.
More than 80 people (agents and civilians)
lost their lives in 1993. The American people
are entitled to know exactly what happened
and why.
Unfortunately, the “official” investigation
of the incident, headed by former senator John
Danforth, was soft and incomplete.
Danforth’s sweeping exoneration of federal
officials is not supported by the factual record.
It is certainly true that Branch Davidian
leader David Koresh cannot escape his share of
responsibility for the tragedy. Scores of lives
could have been saved if he had simply walked
out of Mt. Carmel and surrendered peacefully.
But his refusal to do so cannot absolve federal
officials from what they did at Waco.
Danforth hoped his report would help to
restore the American people’s “faith in gov-
ernment.” After everything that has come to
light in the years since the agents and the
Davidians perished, it is difficult to follow
Danforth’s logic. The ATF, the FBI, and
Attorney General Reno exploited the public’s
faith in government when they tried to
deceive everyone about what happened in
Waco. Recall, for example, that Reno had to
recant her statement that “babies were being
beaten” during the standoff.
Because numerous crimes at Waco have
gone unpunished, the people serving in our
federal police agencies may well come to the
conclusion that it is permissible to recklessly
endanger the lives of innocent people, lie to
newspapers, obstruct congressional subpoe-
nas, and give misleading testimony in our
courtrooms.
113If such activity becomes more
common than it is today, those agencies will
surely become lawless and unaccountable.
The only way to counter that danger is for the
American people to distrust government offi-
cials, limit their powers, and demand
accountability. In 1997 FBI director Louis
Freeh told Congress, “We are potentially the
most dangerous agency in the country if we
are not scrutinized carefully.”
114
The carnage
at Waco is grisly testament to that.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The Branch Dividians were a doomsday cult run by a pedophile “prophet”. Koresh raped many underage girls, married them, and stole the wives of the married men. They believed the end of the world would come after the US government (an arm of Satan) launched an attack upon them. They stockpiles weapons for this battle, illegal weapons, including grenades. When the FBI and ATF attempted to raid them on weapons and child endangerment charges, they believed that final battle had come. While federal agents made many mistakes, the cult knew it was the end and made it so</p>

<p>they showed up at the waco house in force, using military tactics to try to scare them out</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t have an real idea what happened at all, but i think it came to the worst situation while some ultra-religious nut heads and faithly blinded sect followers collided with some dilletantic, irresponsible, cruel and mindless agents.
That the branch davidians were armed to the teeth, escalated things too.</p>

<p>As i see it, for the safety of the kids in the compound there could be only one way to deal with it, de-escalating it.
I can&#39;t imagine such things happen here in Germany, unless there is no imediate risk to the life of the Kids or third persons, there is no reason to escalate the situation and bring their life in danger.</p>

<p>The agents went the path of confrontation from the beginning, not keeping any exit strategies or a plan B in mind if something wents wrong or not the way as intended. Absolute and most unexperienced amateurs at work, if you ask me. Those had to be sacked afterwards.</p>

<p>But also the Branch Davidians reacted in a most idiotic way and first of all David Koresh is responsible for the dramatic and deadly confrontation too.</p>

<p>As final Statement i would say David Koresh was either too stupid to not see this possible kind of escalation or didn&#39;t care of the kids and others. Same goes for the FBI agents.</p>

<p>Have finished the mini series today and still remember those events from the days were i was a bit younger.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The Dividians were operating an Underground Railroad of sorts to try to help kidnapped children escape via the underground tunnel system. They were also hacking into secure Alphabet Agency servers and taking evidence of this &amp; other illicit activities which is why the commander of the op ordered the server room destroyed first. Also, they did negotiate a surrender with the inhabitants and one of the women possessed disk drives upon exit of the building. These drives were later found to be lost and/or destroyed. They were also monitoring the Airport located on the edge of their property which was used as money laundering/drug &amp; weapons running/human trafficking jump off point for agency’s Buffalo Airlines. They had high speed go carts equipped with low wave radios to stay under the Airports radio broadcasts to try and stay undetected. The agency took a page directly out of the Rules for Radicals book and accused the Davidians of doing exactly what they were doing. It was allowed to be broadcast to the entire world as a message to others who would try to help dismantle the illegal actions and help kidnapped children. Sounds insane, I know, but it is what it is. Whether you believe or not it is what it is. Ask yourself these questions. Why would they send 3 former guards of POTUS to the siege? Would all three of which would be dead in a few days? Is friendly fire a possibility? Why would they send Lon Horiuchi to Waco? Is it because he had shown the capability to kill at Ruby Ridge? Was he raised in a Japanese Internment camp and would this make him dislike caucasians? Who fired first? Were there .308 Winchester shell casings littering his position at Sierra One? Why wouldn’t this be looked into? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You’re very welcome. The last link is to a poster who called himself Anon5. I don’t know your politics and when seeking truth politics don’t matter (Reps and Dems are all working for the same people and it’s not the American people) but Anon5 has some things to say about politics.</p>

<p>I’d also recommend doing your research using the private or anonymous browser mode. Do not use TOR, it is wholly funded by the US.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The FBI murdered the Branch Davidians by shooting some of them and then the FBI lit the compound on fire where a bunch of more people died. </p>

<p>That&#39;s what happened in Waco but what lead up to Waco, from my understanding, is that the Branch Davidians were raising money for their church by selling guns.  They started off small at first but selling guns became nicely profitable for the Branch Davidians and they were doing well.</p>

<p>The US Govt didn&#39;t like the Davidians selling guns so the Govt sent the ATF and FBI to take the weapons away but the Davidians weren&#39;t having any of that.  </p>

<p>When David Koresh got shot by the FBI or ATF as he was exiting his front door, he quickly ducked back inside the compound where they were holed up by the FBI and ATF and eventually burned to death.  </p>

<p>This type of behavior from our Govt is the reason we have the First Amendment.  The FBI tried to rush into the compound but were stopped by the guns that the Davidians owned, but they were only protecting themselves.  This is the reason why we cannot ban any type of gun in America.  The Branch Davidians were God loving peaceful people who harmed no one and if this type of stuff could happen to them, it could happen to anyone.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>For the life of me I can&#39;t recall where this documentary came from, it was from the late 90s and had all the shady, grainy goodness you&#39;d expect from a VHS that was a copy of a copy of a copy, etc.  </p>

<p>In this doc, the theory was that most, if not all of the ATF agents killed at Waco while storming in from the roof were all at one point body guards and drivers of Bill Clinton from his time as the Governor of Arkansas. To show his appreciation, he had them hired into the ATF. Then by the events of WACO, all the secrets they were privy to (cheating, corruption, etc.) were forever silenced.  </p>

<p>It was also posited that the bullets that killed these ATF agents, came from the helicopter above, not the rooms adjacent to the agents.</p>

<p>Does this ring any bells for any of you?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I worked at DFW area Forensic Lab in the late 1990s, and the Doctor who ran it once told me that he worked on some of the Fire evidence from the Branch Davidian Compound and in it was a metal gas can that had holes punched in it.  He determined that the holes were made by a screwdriver, and he said that there were over 50 of the metal gas cans found in and around the compound.  He figured that from those holes, that the people inside the compound started the fires.  What do y&#39;all think of that?  </p>
