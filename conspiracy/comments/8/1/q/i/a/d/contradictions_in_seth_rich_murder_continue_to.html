    <div class="md"><p>Why hasn&#39;t Mueller even address the Seth Rich murder?</p>

<p>A recent op-ed from the Washington Times says it well:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The first deals with the murder of the Democratic National Committee (DNC) staffer Seth Rich, and the second deals with the alleged hacking of the DNC server by Russia. Both should be of prime interest to special counsel Robert Mueller, but do not hold your breath.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Say what you want about Kim Dotcom, but he&#39;s been very clear about his position:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>On May 18, 2017, Dotcom proposed that if Congress includes the Seth Rich investigation in their Russia probe, he would provide written testimony with evidence that Seth Rich was WikiLeaks&#39; source.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The ZH article continues:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In addition to several odd facts surrounding Rich&#39;s still unsolved murder - which officials have deemed a &quot;botched robbery,&quot; forensic technical evidence has emerged which contradicts the Crowdstrike report. The Irvine, CA company partially funded by Google, was the only entity allowed to analyze the DNC servers in relation to claims of election hacking.</p>

<p>Notably, Crowdstrike has been considered by many to be discredited over their revision and retraction of a report over Russian hacking of Ukrainian military equipment - a report which the government of Ukraine said was fake news. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Journalist Seymour Hersh has even spoken about a &quot;purported FBI report establishing that Seth Rich sent emails to WikiLeaks.”</p>

<blockquote>
<p>What the report says is that some time in late Spring… he makes contact with WikiLeaks, that’s in his computer,” he says. “Anyway, they found what he had done is that he had submitted a series of documents — of emails, of juicy emails, from the DNC.”</p>

<p>Hersh explains that it was unclear how the negotiations went, but that WikiLeaks did obtain access to a password protected DropBox where Rich had put the files. “All I know is that he offered a sample, an extensive sample, I’m sure dozens of emails, and said ‘I want money.’ Later, WikiLeaks did get the password, he had a DropBox, a protected DropBox,” he said. They got access to the DropBox.”</p>

<p>Hersh also states that Rich had concerns about something happening to him, and had “The word was passed, according to the NSA report, he also shared this DropBox with a couple of friends, so that ‘if anything happens to me it’s not going to solve your problems,’” he added. “WikiLeaks got access before he was killed.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Julian Assange also <em>heavily</em> implied that Rich was the source.</p>

<p>Regardless of your opinion on the subject, it&#39;s quite clear that the jury is still out on the motives behind Seth Rich&#39;s murder. </p>

<p>Despite this uncertainty, it&#39;s very interested that the subject of Seth Rich can bring the conspiracy denialists out of the woodwork more than almost any subject.</p>

<p>Nazi!!! Haha. We&#39;re just going to have to agree to disagree on this. Maybe Assange is biased. He is human. Doesn&#39;t mean that what he implied is untrue. Even a known liar is capable of telling the truth. And if you&#39;re really honest with yourself and you take a look at the down votes and response to anyone questioning the official story in here, you might recognize that there is something deliberate going on. I don&#39;t want to argue with you though. I don&#39;t necessarily think you&#39;re a shill, I think it&#39;s quite likely that you truly believe this. I just see it differently.

    <div class="md"><p>not the poster above, but if you think that JA has a duty to protect his source he&#39;s doing an awful job of it.  However if the source is someone else he is doing an excellent job.  </p>

<p>If your source is murdered over something he gave you to publish I think most would think it a moral obligation to do everything you can to make sure his killer was found.  Instead of publishing proof that he is the source and ensuring a largescale investigation is launched he hints and drops clues that maybe he is the source.  I think if a source is assasinated you do more than just beat around the bush of who your source is.  Who wants to be a source when you get assasinated and JA doesnt shout that from the mountaintop?</p>

<p>If you think that his source is someone else it IMO makes more sense.  You imply that someone who is already dead is the source and then you have someone who can&#39;t be questioned or refute you.  Wikileaks still has deniability because you never OUTRIGHT said it, you were just heartbroken over the seth murder and wanted justice to be done.  Anyone who thought he was the source was just connecting dots that werent there.  Your source is protected through distraction.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Wikileaks claims to protect their sources, even in death I believe.  Heavily implying someone is a source, even if it’s just Julian saying it and not an official claim, violates the spirit of that claim though not the letter.  If Wikileaks is to be trusted and their claims of protecting their sources is true, heavily implying X as the source makes it more likely it’s a red herring meant to distract.  Basically either Wikileaks is trustworthy and Seth isn’t the source or Wikileaks isn’t trustworthy and leakers/whistleblowers are risking exposure by contacting them.</p>

<p>Ain&#39;t that the truth. The response to all things Seth Rich in this community in particular really do lead me to believe that this is a topic that certain groups will do everything in their power to quiet and derail the discussion on. I still have questions though. So despite the virtue signaling and down voting I won&#39;t be shamed or silenced. Something fucking fishy happened in the summer of 2016. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Bitch, I am pursuing a PhD in mathematics, but originally I pursued physics as an undergrad and I can promsie you that I apparently took the pseudo-core classes you have missed like basic shit like holy shit how do you think physics is anything but conjectures and statistics? DO you know how they prove something at the LHC? THey perform tests and check the results against predictions so as to narrow down teh statistical chance that a theory is true to be as high as possible, but even more technically they&#39;re disproving an alternative theory and simply doing so enough times they can be like &quot;well not-this isn&#39;t allt that likely so probably this&quot;. You, my little peasant of reality, are nothing but an inductive logician at best which is a wee bit weaker than the deduction we do all up here in math land (to the point they are in fact categorically opposed to each other, 1 or 0 as compared to (1,0)). </p>

<p>One of the things that I think you might forget when you complain about downvotes in your posts is that the people that you have banned in the past are probably still visiting r/conspiracy.

    <div class="md"><p>The problem with the Seth Rich theory is at this point it would be an incredibly remarkable coincidence for the DNC/Podesta hacks to not have originated from Russia.</p>

<p>We know they had the troll farm campaign, and we know that Papadopolous was informed Russia had thousands of “Clinton emails” in April 2016, which was well before any public statements from Wikileaks, crowdstrike, or communication between Wikileaks and Roger Stone/Trump Jr.</p>

<p>Now, technically none of the emails were to or from Hillary Clinton, so it could be argued that the DNC/Podesta emails aren’t truly “Clinton emails”, but they absolutely damaged Hillary’s character and image. It’s completely believable that the DNC/Podesta emails could’ve been described as “Clinton emails” by the professor since it sounds more salacious and they were trying pretty hard to foster cooperation from Papadopolous and the campaign through him.</p>

<p>Kim’s 2015 tweet about Assange being Hillary’s worst nightmare could easily be coincidence as Kim hates Hillary and has a habit of periodically saying inflammatory shit to get attention and try to stay relevant. Also, if he had info, he could easily release it publicly, the “my lawyers say I can’t excuse” is almost certainly bullshit.</p>

<p>The one piece of information that I hadn’t seen before was the Hersch audio, but again he even admits it’s based on hearsay, he’s got no first hand evidence.</p>

<p>I have a sneaking suspicion Mueller is going to Indict Wikileaks/Assange on conspiracy charges, and then indict Trump Jr./Stone, maybe others on conspiracy for their communications with Wikileaks that could be construed as making efforts to aid the dissemination of stolen property.</p>

<p>If I’m right and Wikileaks/Assange are indicted, that will force Assange’s hand to provide a defense, the only real defense being proof that Russia wasn’t the source of the stolen emails.</p>

<p>So, if there is, by some remarkable coincidence, evidence that Seth rich was the leaker, then I imagine Wikileaks/Assange will have to finally put that in the public sphere in order to defend themselves.</p>

<p>But I put the chance of Seth Rich being the leaker very close to 0. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m confused about your comment. </p>

<p>There were multiple leaks of information. </p>

<p>Clinton&#39;s emails were published on <a href="https://wikileaks.com/clinton-emails/">March 16, 2016</a> by Wikileaks. So anyone with an internet connection had access to them by April of 2016. And contrary to what you said about them being emails to and from Hillary Clinton, that&#39;s exactly what they are.</p>

<p>Maybe you&#39;re talking about the <a href="https://wikileaks.org/dnc-emails/">DNC leaks</a> which were published on July 22nd, 2016.</p>

<p>Or <a href="https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/">John Podestas</a> email leak.</p>

<p>Those are three completely different things. I think your problem here is your habit of wanting to tie these Russian hacking allegations to what happened during the election with these leaks. You&#39;re making connections and assumptions that don&#39;t add up.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The March emails were released by the DOJ and Wikileaks just published them in an easier to search format. Those weren’t stolen, they were released by the US government.</p>

<p>I was referring to the DNC/Podesta leaks, professor guy told Papadopolous Russia had “1000s of Clinton emails”. Nothing related to DNC/Podesta was disclosed or publicly commented on until well after Papadopolous’ April meeting with the professor.</p>

<p>So unless Russia was outright bluffing with Papadopolous and to the various Steele mentions of disclosures, and by some incredible coincidence a separate entity actually did hack and give Wikileaks “1000s of Clinton emails” to make the Russian bluff seem credible, than the hackers and leakers were Russian.</p>

<p>The allegations that don’t add up are that Seth Rich was the leaker. He still could be but it would require an astounding level of coincidence.</p>

<p>He didn’t name Rich, he gave an awkward head nod that people have decided to use as definitive proof that it was Seth Rich.</p>

<p>Julian won’t comment because he says he protects his sources.</p>

<p>If his source was Seth, by not disclosing he was the source, he’d only be protecting Seth’s murderers.</p>

<p>If the DNC or HRC has Seth killed, Julian is literally protecting them by not disclosing Seth was the source. Do you think Seth would protect Hillary Clinton from being investigated for conspiracy to murder someone?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No he didn’t. He made cryptic references. I’m not going to argue that you can’t perceive this as highly indicative, but Assange didn’t outright say anything. The reporter was right to press him and when he did, Assange remained extremely vague.</p>

<p>Seth Rich is dead. If he’s the source there’s nothing to protect except for his family’s wishes. His family has stated they just want the killers brought to justice. No one is investigating it as a potential “hit”.</p>

<p>So if Seth was the source and Julian won’t just definitively state “Seth Rich provided the DNC emails” then he’s essentially protecting the elements of the DNC who theoretically may have conspired to kill him because no one is investigating that angle until he just outright confirms Seth Rich as the source.</p>

<p>So to believe Seth Rich was the source means you believe Assange is protecting his possible murder(ers). </p>

<p>If it adds up for you, then cool. I personally don’t find it convincing.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ok the speed thing only even referred to the DNC emails, not Podesta, and the speed thing is absolutely not conclusive, the blogger who posted it even backtracked on the conclusive claim iirc.</p>

<p>So fine you could argue the DNC was a leak, but then someone/thing still phished Podesta. So even then there’s still multiple entities involved, one of which would still most likely be Russia given what I laid out above.</p>

<p>Yes, it’s absolutely possible that Russia was referring to private server emails. But how coincidental would it be that they stated that, never released the private server emails, and then in the meantime Seth Rich leaks the DNC emails, and some other non Russia group fishes Podesta and publishes through Wikileaks?</p>

<p>They clearly had a sophisticated campaign to fuck over Hillary, and they made claims of having “Clinton emails”. The simplest thing is they did it. Everything else requires extraordinary coincidences to have taken place.</p>

<p>Biggest problem is the Seth Rich theory only even explains the DNC emails, it doesn’t explain the Podesta email hack.</p>

<p>Seth Rich could’ve leaked the DNC emails and Russia could still have hacked Podesta.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree. If Seth rich were the leaker then this does not imply that there was no russian involvement. </p>

<p>However, it would imply a much darker side to the DNC.  Don&#39;t forget that there has been much more talk about the source of the DNC leaks than the damaging content. </p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>The problem with the Seth Rich theory is at this point it would be an incredibly remarkable coincidence for the DNC/Podesta hacks to not have originated from Russia.</p>

<p>We know they had the troll farm campaign</p>
</blockquote>

<p>For all intents and purposes the troll farm didn&#39;t work. They focused on meaningless states and places where Trump had no chance at winning. They duped Michael Moore and some old lady.  They acted as a less effective CTR. CTR actually managed to take over an &quot;objective&quot; sub and was financed by a foreign entity.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>and we know that Papadopolous was informed Russia had thousands of “Clinton emails” in April 2016, which was well before any public statements from Wikileaks, crowdstrike, or communication between Wikileaks and Roger Stone/Trump Jr.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We also know Clinton&#39;s homebrew server was compromised and likely accessed by everyone with means and inclination. By that point dirt about Clinton floating around was a given.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Now, technically none of the emails were to or from Hillary Clinton, so it could be argued that the DNC/Podesta emails aren’t truly “Clinton emails”, but they absolutely damaged Hillary’s character and image.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>How did emails DNC/Podesta wrote damage Clinton&#39;s reputation?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Kim’s 2015 tweet about Assange being Hillary’s worst nightmare could easily be coincidence as Kim hates Hillary and has a habit of periodically saying inflammatory shit to get attention and try to stay relevant. Also, if he had info, he could easily release it publicly, the “my lawyers say I can’t excuse” is almost certainly bullshit.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Clinton wants Assange dead and hasn&#39;t been shy about sharing that. She considers him an enemy. Kim&#39;s situation is complicated. I can see why he occasionally throws something out but would never say certain things/travel.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The one piece of information that I hadn’t seen before was the Hersch audio, but again he even admits it’s based on hearsay, he’s got no first hand evidence.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I don&#39;t see Hersch resolving anything Seth Rich related.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I have a sneaking suspicion Mueller is going to Indict Wikileaks/Assange on conspiracy charges, and then indict Trump Jr./Stone, maybe others on conspiracy for their communications with Wikileaks that could be construed as making efforts to aid the dissemination of stolen property.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>wow</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If I’m right and Wikileaks/Assange are indicted, that will force Assange’s hand to provide a defense, the only real defense being proof that Russia wasn’t the source of the stolen emails.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What fantasy court will Assange appear in? I&#39;m not sure you understand how courts work.  A defendant is not obligated to prove anything. Defendants only need to disprove allegations.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>So, if there is, by some remarkable coincidence, evidence that Seth rich was the leaker, then I imagine Wikileaks/Assange will have to finally put that in the public sphere in order to defend themselves.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But I put the chance of Seth Rich being the leaker very close to 0.</p>

<p>Or a DNC data analyst leaked. Morst likely a DNC analyst leaked and given Democrats shit security practices a bunch of other nations also had the emails &amp; emails from before.</p>

<p>Do defendants prove they are innocent or do they disprove allegations? Assange isn&#39;t leaving the embassy if there is any chance of him seeing a court. An indictment is not a guilty verdict. It is an allegation. </p>

<p>haha It would kill his credibility if he didn&#39;t appear in a kangaroo court (where he is innocent before guilty) and must provide you with a conspiracy and not a defense wow</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ok fine guy.</p>

<p>They damaged her reputation. If you don’t believe that, then you’re lying or stupid. This place and other outlets went fucking wild over those emails. Outlets were publishing “Here’s the 25 most damaging emails” type lists and people were interested.</p>

<p>Even if you don’t think the emails mattered, someone still stole them and leaked them. <em>Your</em> opinion of whether they’re damaging is completely irrelevant. They were stolen, Wikileaks published them, that happened.</p>

<p>I’m not in any way defending CTR/Shareblue/anyone else. I’m also not arguing I think the troll farm efforts were effective. I’m arguing the troll indictment pretty fucking clearly indicates a concerted effort to do everything possible to fuck over Hillary and generally just get people pissed at each other. Leaking stolen emails fits that bill pretty damn well.</p>

<p>Defendants 100% do disprove allegations when they are able to. If there are no credible allegations of guilt against them, then they are innocent. By disproving allegations, you hamper the prosecution’s ability to prove your guilt. This is basic logic.</p>

<p>You can call it a kangaroo court, maybe it is, but it’s besides the point. And I guarantee you if the US tried to force Ecuador to kick him out, they’d submit. The US has a history of fucking over small nation’s who get in its way (as I’m sure you well know). Ecuador knows that too.</p>

<p>I’m not arguing some people would still believe support Assange, but not defending himself and allowing the “Russian state actor” label (with a US indictment against him) to stick would effectively kill his credibility with the average, politically independent person.</p>

<p>If he could disprove allegations, my assumption is he would.</p>

<p>All a defendant needs to do is disprove allegations. It is up to the prosecution to prove allegations. A defendant is never obligated to come up with a new case for the prosecution. This is all a far cry from what you suggested earlier.</p>

<p>lol the fact that Assange wouldn&#39;t appear in a legit court doesn&#39;t even matter to you. You already said he would have to come up with his own theory rather than face allegations like every other defendant.</p>

<p>More of this nonsense. It is like,&quot; Hey, money is missing from a bank. You are human and bank. Disprove my allegation that you robbed the bank. Otherwise; you are guilty! Super guilty. Nothing beats an allegation that has never seen a courthouse!&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>OK then let me spell it out.</p>

<ul>
<li>Some people (seemingly including you? Doesn&#39;t really matter for the sake of this argument anyway) say that Rich leaked the emails and got killed due to that.</li>
<li>Some people claim that they have proof of that.</li>
<li><strong>No one</strong> released any proof.</li>
<li>You come on and say &quot;yeah but absence of evidence isn&#39;t evidence of absence&quot;.</li>
</ul>

<p>Sure, you can use that saying as you like, but the truth is, with high profile orgs or attention whorse (Dotcom) claiming they have definite proof of the whole shebang, if no one has put forward said proof, I&#39;m inclined to think they&#39;re all bullshitting, and the theory is therefore probably justy that: a theory.</p>

What was revealed was low key not a big deal to anyone sane and there woudl ahve been no reason to reveal it unless you read it.... the whole problem was all the people who read tilted summaries and tiny excerpts. I mean ffs, I would say that the Seth Rich theory has as much chance of being true as Pizzagate (teh specific theory, nto this bs trying to make pizzagate into a catchall term for pedophiles in power which fucking everyone already knows about jfc). Like, where is teh evidence? Literally the only real reason people link Seth Rich instead of someone else is because of his murder and, quite frankly,t hat should maek it very clear what they&#39;re thinking (hint: hillary is a murderbot is what they&#39;re thinking). Like, I really don&#39;t know waht to tell you - there is literaly more evidence of satanic rituals in the basement of a pizza parlor THAT DOESN&#39;T AHVE A BASEMENT than their is of Seth Rich besides &quot;well everyones know killary would killary the leaker and he died while workign there before&quot;. In fact, I would say it&#39;s more likely someone we&#39;ve never heard of leaked it if anyone because it went through wikileaks and the one thing they do well is anonymity of leakers who don&#39;t choose to reveal themselves (even if like half of those leakers are  prooobably just Putin wearing various disguises lol). </p>

<p>That&#39;s not true. There&#39;s also the Podesta email saying &quot;I&#39;m all for making an example of a suspected leaked whether there&#39;s any real basis for it or not.&quot; Also, Julian Assange <em>heavily</em> implied that Seth Rich was the leaker, before saying he couldn&#39;t disclose any identities.</p>

<p>Also, Alefantis mentions a basement himself. How do you know there isn&#39;t one? That guy with the gun is batshit crazy until the basement is brought up, then he&#39;s a reputable PI.</p>

In fact, if he knew he basically ruined the existence and trustworthiness of wikileaks as a way of getting rid of anonymous info (which might explain why nobody goes to him anymore with shit except for Russia and friends of Russia). DUDE. THERE IS NO BASEMENT. Tons of people ahve visited there, checked the city plans, and even worked there and reported the complete lack of basement onr eddit.

    <div class="md"><p>Here is the text from a post I made about why I believe that it is more likely that Seth Rich was the leak, as opposed to the Russians.</p>

<p>IIRC, Assange told PBS that DNC was the leak. Assange told PBS in the interview with Judy Woodruff that the source was from the DNC. There is no evidence whatsoever that Russia was the leak of the DNC emails. I also found the interview where he mentions Seth Rich by name, which I incorrectly stated in my original comment as coming from the PBS interview with Woodruff and Assange.</p>

<p>This makes sense to me for several reasons.</p>

<p>First of all, Seth Rich was murdered in the street shortly after the leak. Nothing was stolen, and the killers have never been found. He also had the means to be the leak as he worked for the DNC in a position with access to the info leaked.</p>

<p>Second, he was a Bernie fan. Anyone supporting Bernie was outraged when people like Donna Brazile admitted that the DNC rigged the primaries against Bernie. This gives Rich a motive to leak the info.</p>

<p>My third line of reasoning stems from the fact that Clinton&#39;s campaign was shit talking Russia for a long time. Not saying it may not have been warranted, but they have been trying to pin anything and everything on Russia. It felt to me that they were preparing for a possible military escalation once Clinton assumed office.</p>

<p>It makes sense that once the leaks happened, if the DNC gave any credence to the possibility that Seth Rich could of been the leak, they would be obvious suspects in his murder. Even if they had nothing to do with it, that would look very bad during an election.</p>

<p>Not only would it look bad, but Trump, being the media whore that he is, would never let it down. He would of hammered the theory over and over if it meant winning the presidency.</p>

<p>The DNC and Clinton/Podesta had every motive to put the blame on Russia, which supported their earlier statements about Russian issues they kept pressing in the election, while also pivoting away from any theory that could bring them into the spotlight of not only having a motive to silence Seth Rich, but also giving more attention to the fact that they rigged the Democratic primaries.</p>

<p>Why wouldn&#39;t they rather create an issue of outside influence on the election, instead of losing face while the public focused on the rigging of the primaries?</p>

<p>Ever since then, the media has been stuck on Russian interference, while the horrendous crime of rigging the primaries has essentially gone unpunished. I have no problem with investigating Russian interference, but I&#39;m beginning to feel that it&#39;s become more of a media distraction to keep the public from holding people accountable for the insanity of our presidential election.</p>

<p>Assange could be lying and there&#39;s no proof Seth Rich gave a fuck about Bernie Sanders. </p>

<p>Red scare. Let the Russians go because of war.
They are literally being accused of taking the emails. I think that&#39;s good enough to warrant some shit talking to Russia. </p>

<p>So you don&#39;t have a way for Seth to hack the emails. You know he gained access to private emails right? Of government officials? That&#39;s prison.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Any whistleblower? So you&#39;re just assuming he leaked the emails. How did he even have access? </p>

<p>You&#39;re never going to answer because you&#39;re all Republican conspiracy roleplaying. You seem to show such more care for the morality of the democrat party. It&#39;s really touching. It makes me feel good to know when I call out Republicans for being neo-communists, I&#39;m 100% right. Because they all wanted Bernie too. That&#39;s why they so mad. That&#39;s why they pretend Democrats are Satanic and Republicans are all that&#39;s good in the world. </p>

<p>Yet they want to abolish the free market because Jews were better at it. They want money out of politics because they aren&#39;t in the loop. </p>

<p>You don&#39;t have any proof Seth Rich leaked the emails other than a gotcha question&#39;s answer when asked. </p>

<p>This is radicalized McCarthyism at it&#39;s finest. Only fitting The Don is president for this time.</p>

<p>The McCarthy is Democrats were murderers first above all else and everything they do no matter what Democrats are murderers. They get hacked as a campaign by a foreign power with real power, their secrets revealed suddenly we try to spin that to a man who was apparently hacking his boss&#39;s emails and turned into a &quot;whistleblower&quot; that Democrats tried to sneak in the first black man and the first woman president back to back. </p>

<p>It doesn&#39;t make sense Seth Rich was reading his boss&#39;s emails when he was making apps. Unless he was hacking into them. </p>

<p>Mueller is preparing indictments for this aspect of the investigation as we speak. If you think those indictments won&#39;t have hard evidence you don&#39;t understand how indictments work or how courts work. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ok fine guy.</p>

<p>They damaged her reputation. If you don’t believe that, then you’re lying or stupid. This place and other outlets went fucking wild over those emails. Outlets were publishing “Here’s the 25 most damaging emails” type lists and people were interested.</p>

<p>Even if you don’t think the emails mattered, someone still stole them and leaked them. <em>Your</em> opinion of whether they’re damaging is completely irrelevant. They were stolen, Wikileaks published them, that happened.</p>

<p>I’m not in any way defending CTR/Shareblue/anyone else. I’m also not arguing I think the troll farm efforts were effective. I’m arguing the troll indictment pretty fucking clearly indicates a concerted effort to do everything possible to fuck over Hillary and generally just get people pissed at each other. Leaking stolen emails fits that bill pretty damn well.</p>

<p>Defendants 100% do disprove allegations when they are able to. If there are no credible allegations of guilt against them, then they are innocent. By disproving allegations, you hamper the prosecution’s ability to prove your guilt. This is basic logic.</p>

<p>You can call it a kangaroo court, maybe it is, but it’s besides the point. And I guarantee you if the US tried to force Ecuador to kick him out, they’d submit. The US has a history of fucking over small nation’s who get in its way (as I’m sure you well know). Ecuador knows that too.</p>

<p>I’m not arguing some people would still believe support Assange, but not defending himself and allowing the “Russian state actor” label (with a US indictment against him) to stick would effectively kill his credibility with the average, politically independent person.</p>

<p>If he could disprove allegations, my assumption is he would.</p>

<p>When the only people left who believe you already distrust the government in the first place, there’s really no point to confining yourself to a tiny embassy apartment so that you can “open up governments”.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Seth Rich worked for the DNC. He was passionate about politics, and was involved for some time. </p>

<p>If he came across the information about collusion between the DNC and Hillary Clinton&#39;s campaign, he may have felt it was an injustice worth leaking.</p>

<p>If I had been given access to the same information detailing a rigging of the democratic primaries against a candidate, I would most certainly consider leaking it as well.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Here is the text from a post I made about why I believe that it is more likely that Seth Rich was the leak, as opposed to the Russians.</p>

<p>IIRC, Assange told PBS that DNC was the leak. Assange told PBS in the interview with Judy Woodruff that the source was from the DNC. There is no evidence whatsoever that Russia was the leak of the DNC emails. I also found the interview where he mentions Seth Rich by name, which I incorrectly stated in my original comment as coming from the PBS interview with Woodruff and Assange.</p>

<p>This makes sense to me for several reasons.</p>

<p>First of all, Seth Rich was murdered in the street shortly after the leak. Nothing was stolen, and the killers have never been found. He also had the means to be the leak as he worked for the DNC in a position with access to the info leaked.</p>

<p>Second, he was a Bernie fan. Anyone supporting Bernie was outraged when people like Donna Brazile admitted that the DNC rigged the primaries against Bernie. This gives Rich a motive to leak the info.</p>

<p>My third line of reasoning stems from the fact that Clinton&#39;s campaign was shit talking Russia for a long time. Not saying it may not have been warranted, but they have been trying to pin anything and everything on Russia. It felt to me that they were preparing for a possible military escalation once Clinton assumed office.</p>

<p>It makes sense that once the leaks happened, if the DNC gave any credence to the possibility that Seth Rich could of been the leak, they would be obvious suspects in his murder. Even if they had nothing to do with it, that would look very bad during an election.</p>

<p>Not only would it look bad, but Trump, being the media whore that he is, would never let it down. He would of hammered the theory over and over if it meant winning the presidency.</p>

<p>The DNC and Clinton/Podesta had every motive to put the blame on Russia, which supported their earlier statements about Russian issues they kept pressing in the election, while also pivoting away from any theory that could bring them into the spotlight of not only having a motive to silence Seth Rich, but also giving more attention to the fact that they rigged the Democratic primaries.</p>

<p>Why wouldn&#39;t they rather create an issue of outside influence on the election, instead of losing face while the public focused on the rigging of the primaries?</p>

<p>Ever since then, the media has been stuck on Russian interference, while the horrendous crime of rigging the primaries has essentially gone unpunished. I have no problem with investigating Russian interference, but I&#39;m beginning to feel that it&#39;s become more of a media distraction to keep the public from holding people accountable for the insanity of our presidential election.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>All I can tell you is that further investigations were made and what results were released pointed pretyt specifically not only to Russia but IIRC a specific hacking circle in Russia believed with a decent amount of assurance to be tied to the actual government/kgb mafia they sometimes pretend is a government. I mean that&#39;s part of the problem, they have the ex-head of the KGB in charge and he&#39;s been in charge for quite some time now so the ltine between state and non-state is seriously blurred in a lot of different parts of Russia simply because oftentimes PUtin and The Russian State are the same in all but name. </p>
