        <p><span class="badge badge-primary">9</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;2018-03-02 by <a class="author" href="../../../../../../../../user/Volehearts.html">Volehearts</a></p>
        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>This time, in my research of the reddit community i have looked into which are the most shilled &amp; controversial points of discussion on the entire site. Ones that seemingly get downvoted every single time they are criticized.</p>

<ul>
<li>Police Brutality</li>
</ul>

<p>Starting with this one, people seem to think that killing unarmed civilians is justified because the police always put their life&#39;s on the line, which somehow excuses their acts of violence. Even expressing your dislike of them will result in instant downvotes every single time, truly despicable. Even heard people tell others that unarmed people are a dangerous threat to armed cops. Point out any instance of police brutality &amp; the ignorant masses will always leap to the defense of the police every single time. I don&#39;t understand this at all, people can&#39;t be this stupid. The blame will always be placed on the victim who was murdered &amp; none ever gets placed on the cops. This is easily the most frustrating one on the entire list</p>

<ul>
<li>Michael Jackson</li>
</ul>

<p>The &quot;Gloved one&quot; is a major source of controversy, while most people seem to think he is completely innocent, lots of people have still bought into the media&#39;s lies about him &amp; are viemetly behind the notion that he is somehow a child molestor, despite him very clearly being framed by the elite. Every time he is mention the post will always be downvote brigaded, every single fucking time. This should be a headline in our next roundtable discussion. He is likely the most interesting person in history, there is such a huge mystery surrounding his entire life</p>

<ul>
<li>Corporate Greed</li>
</ul>

<p>Yes surprisingly reddit strongly defends &amp; shills corporate greed, people do not like it at all if you even insuite the notion that this is the source for most of the world&#39;s problems, people just shrug &amp; will defend any negative piece of information you give them, it&#39;s like this is seemingly off limits for some reason, i&#39;m not even sure these discussions are real anymore wouldn&#39;t be surprised if most of the upvotes/downvotes are being manipulated somehow. </p>

<ul>
<li>Israel</li>
</ul>

<p>You can absolutely not criticize them in any shape or form, Reddit is incredibly defensive of this to the point of it being nearly cult like. People seem to hate the idea of anyone standing up for the rights of palestians &amp; have this sick &amp; warped sense of morality that somehow its Palestine’s fault for not bending over &amp; taking Israel’s dick willingly. I’ve never seen such a digusting act by the mass public, people are blantantly turning a blind eye for the well-being of Palestines because apparently Israel can do no wrong &amp; the thought of jews controlling the world is a “nonsense conspiracy theory”. Which brings up my final point criticizing them in any way always gets you hit with the label of being an “anti-semetic” as people will quickly bring up the Holocaust &amp; mention how horrible it was as if that execuses Israel’s atrocities over the years.</p>

<ul>
<li>Pizzagate</li>
</ul>

<p>Obviously this one was a given, there has likely never been a topic that has faced harder push back then this one, it will always no matter what be downvoted to hell whenever its mentioned, mods have gone great lenghts to censor any form of discussion about this once so ever, people will always be quick to mention that it is somehow been &quot;debunked&quot; already &amp; that this conspiracy theory is completely fake news. No subreddit has escaped this pattern, its shocking to me honestly. I have to believe that the reason for this is the case is because this is conspiracy is ultimately true. And corporate doesn&#39;t want anyone to find out so they will do anything to make sure it stays &quot;fake news&quot;</p>

<ul>
<li>Mass Shootings</li>
</ul>

<p>Last one, here we go. People do not like it at all if you even insinuate that a school shooting might be a false flag, its karma suicide to even talk about this subject, people will jump on you &amp; call you every inflammatory name in the book. They will believe anything the media tells them regarding the official story, any pieces of incriminating information gets brushed aside as just some &quot;crazy conspiracy theory&quot; its like logic will always be thrown out of the window when discussing these, people seem to think its normal for kids to be able to accurately pull off a One man army Call of Duty style and just single handedly carry around huge amounts of ammo, grenades &amp; weapons on their back and start shooting up schools. Like right now all of the important details about the shootings that are being discussed here are completely blind to the mass public, which is a fucking shame because their is something huge going on behind the scenes here. </p>

<p>I feel like these should be primary sources of discussion on this subreddit, these conspiracy that are shilled the hardest should be focused on more instead of daily Trump/Hilary bullshit.</p>

<p>No One!</p>

<p>First you need to learn the basics (it is really normal to see a high Level in multiple Sievert close to the Core, even in a undamaged NPS)</p>

<p>This Concept (to understand the basics) is really important (in Politics, Sociology, Medicine, Biology, etc.)</p>

<p>And you should learn that “Zerohedge &amp; Colleagues” are not there to educate but to manipulate you, do not give them any Credibility, use them as a little Input only!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I laughed at this because while your summaries are accurate, they also equally fit the hive mind of the entire USA.</p>

<p>Just for the hell of it, I would definitely add 9/11 to that list. I think Corbett summarized the Reddit/US consensus on 9/11 eloquently and succinctly, so I quote Corbett when I say this about   the Government&#39;s official story of events on 9/11:

<blockquote>
<p>This is the story of 9/11, brought to you by the media which told you the hard truths about JFK and incubator babies and mobile production facilities and the rescue of Jessica Lynch.</p>

<p>If you have any questions about this story…you are a batshit, paranoid, tinfoil, dog-abusing baby-hater and will be reviled by everyone. If you love your country and/or freedom, happiness, rainbows, rock and roll, puppy dogs, apple pie and your grandma, you will never ever express doubts about any part of this story to anyone. Ever.</p>
