    <div class="md"><p>the presidents are as corrupt as is needed by the imperial interests they serve.  they tend to do exactly as they are told.  some of the fundamental qualities desired in a president are solid acting skills and showmanship. when they stop playing ball they get replaced, but when they play their cards well and serve their masters well they are admitted to move up the ladder one notch.  like how bush sr was admitted into the smom after a lifelong service.  thats really all to it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Reagan, Bush Sr, Clinton, Bush Jr.,and Obama were all Deep State presidential puppets. One in the same. Their last 30 years of  combined corruption has inflicted an unprecedented amount of financial destruction upon the American people and economy.  Each one of them successively doubled the national debt during their presidential terms. There&#39;s $21 trillion in unauthorized and completely unaccounted for government spending just in the last 17 years under Bush Jr and Obama. They are all part of a long running agenda to financially bleed the American people dry then tear us apart with their divisive media tactics, manipulation, and propaganda. It is painfully obvious to most of us now that this is already happening at an accelerated pace. The sudden massive media push to massively censor any and all sources of independent investigative journalism and disarm the American people is a sign of their growing desperation to maintain control over us. The end is near. Whether or not is will be our end or theirs remains to be seen.</p>

<p>Whether or not all this is just part of their political theatre and Trump is just the next phase in their globalist agenda, or if he&#39;s truly a rogue element trying to fight the deep state apparatus to restore the power to the American people also remains to be seen.</p>

<p>What is certain is that some very significant shit is going to happen over the next 3 years and likely as soon as the next several months.</p>

<p>If Cliff High is correct in his predictions, then some extremely important shit is about to happen regarding the release of long oppressed highly advanced free-energy technologies that have been kept from us by this deep state of secret societies and their centralized globalist corporate establishment that rule most of the world. Energy technology that will alter the course of humanity virtually over night. </p>

<p>We can only hope for the best and prepare for the worst.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The more information that is found and the more connections are uncovered, it&#39;s becoming more and more difficult to simply dismiss this as a plot by a single group. </p>

<p>What I mean is that there is no possible agency, even in an illuminatist&#39;s most intense fever dreams, that could pull so many strings across so many factions. </p>

<p>What I mean is this: There is no one single overarching world control entity that controls every facet of every government, that much is manifestly obvious. </p>

<p>And the scope of the factions are so freaking wide that I can&#39;t think of any coherent control entity that could pull that many strings so conveniently, chaotically, and effectively. </p>

<p>No, this is the result of aggregate human awareness finally having the tools to piece together what was everyday operations for our government before social media and technology put the world at our fingertips. </p>

<p>It&#39;s like: Cop violence isn&#39;t on the rise but we <em>think</em> it is because we see it <strong>all the time</strong> on media, social and conventional. </p>

<p>But statistically, per officer violence is at a downtrend. </p>

<p>Just that nowadays everyone has access to a vast network of stored data that is notoriously hard to expunge data from. </p>

<p>So we have less cop violence but we have more people capable and ready to record and disseminate such material. </p>

<p>Which is probably why there has been a downturn in cop violence.</p>

<p>So, what is more likely? Phone manufacturers are secretly funding false flag operations to further sales of their portable media recorders that also happen to have calling features, or that people are just now organically starting to realize what it&#39;s always been like before the internet made the entire world our encyclopedia?</p>
