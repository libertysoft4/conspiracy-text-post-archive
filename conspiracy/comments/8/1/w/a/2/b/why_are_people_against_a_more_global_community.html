        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Disclaimer: With everyone going off on globalism, this may be an unpopular, or inflammatory question to some. But remember - it&#39;s just a question. Nothing else. If you get emotional answering it, or make assumptions about me for asking it, that&#39;s on you. Not me. </p>

<p>What is the problem with feeling like you&#39;re a citizen of the world? Now time out. I&#39;m talking about the following: 1. A world where everyone on the planet has a decent living standard. 2. Where your race, or religion isn&#39;t a means for fighting. 3. Where people welcome people of other cultures. 4. Where we accept others despite their differences. 5. Where we can travel freely with visas to their countries, and they can travel freely to ours. 6. Where we explore, make friends, and welcome strangers into our lives. This to me is feeling like you&#39;re a citizen of the world. Where you don&#39;t judge those you don&#39;t understand, you learn from them, and we help each other. </p>

<p>I hear people spit on globalism, and you are essentially making sure none of what I listed ever happens. You may think you&#39;re spitting on world banks, and governments stealing from people, but it&#39;s us on the bottom that gets hurt. ALWAYS. Why do people shy away from becoming a peace loving world? Why do people put the health of the economy in front of the health of the people? Why is paying for something always the biggest factor? We are paying for all our poor decisions with our inability to reach our potential. Why are so many people either willingly, or out of ignorance, against this? </p>

We are not helpless, we have a sense of mission, many of us have a sense of duty, many of us wish they could contribute or do something to make a change, and now is the time to start small. Just believe it is possible first and foremost. That&#39;s all it takes to start an avalanche. </p>

Maybe if you&#39;re really old that&#39;s true, but the only reason it takes time is a matter of organization, logistics and working together. Look what some people have achieved in their own lives. There were people saying it would never happen to them too. It doesn&#39;t even make sense to decide how long it will take or whether it will happen. It makes sense to decide if you want it to happen or not. And once you&#39;ve made that decision, support it with your actions in whatever little way you can. If you want it to happen in your life or don&#39;t want it to happen in your life, your actions will take you straight there. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well explaining evolution, emergence and complexity theory like someone is 5 while being tipsy is kind of a tall order.</p>

<p>Do you understand how crystals form? Lets start there.</p>

<p>A solution of say, salt water is just a mix with no real order. The solution will behave like a liquid. If you let salt water dry, through dehydration and <em>self organization</em>, salt crystals will form in a regular way.</p>

<p>That is to say, salt crystals have a predictable structure. They may be somewhat unique at a large scale, but their underlying structure coalesces into being in the same way every time. Its complexity emerging from seeming chaos, <em>because of the way the atoms arrange themselves because of their own fundamental properties like their orbitals and bond angles</em>.</p>

<p>The basic underlying nature of sodium and chlorine(the constituent elements of NaCl table salt) gives rise to the structure of the crystals.</p>

<p>Well wtf does that have to do with evolution? Its the same process but with more variables than two atoms and their underlying atomic structures. Yet, complexity forms from seeming randomness: stars from coalescing hydrogen, planets from coalescing dust in a stars accretion disc, and so on right down to life itself forming and then evolving into different species, each either being well adapted and surviving and continuing to evolve, or going extinct as most of the species that have ever existed have gone extinct.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re making the classic mistake of assuming all cultures and all people are equal, that they are just like you except with brown skin or have a different word for god, etc. That is demonstrably untrue and sadly most people only find that out when their country begins to negatively change from within after mass migration (Sweden, Germany, etc). </p>

    <div class="md"><p>There is evidence the Chinese visited the americas and only communicated with the natives, leaving them in peace. It was not the natives to be blamed for their polices. It was the English to be blamed for theirs. </p>

<p>All people are equal in that they experience life as a human equally. Negative change is a relative term.</p>

<p>I’ve been to sweden and Germany. Malmö’s best street food is falafel. Best in Europe they say. Arabic kids are just as important as Swedish kids and just as smart. What you’re talking about is the impact of people feeling unloved and unwanted and lashing out. It has nothing to do with their inherent value as a person. </p>

<p>I met a girl who came from war torn Bosnia. She was maybe 10. She looked at me in the eyes and drew her finger across her throat and pointed to me. I was so freaked out but it wasn’t her culture. It was what she’d seen and witnessed. People, with love are all able to respect each other. It’s intolerance that causes strife.</p>

<p>Every crime because someone is poor occurs not because of their culture, but because they have nothing to speak of and the streets call their name to be a hustler or an opportunist. There are so many ways to categorize negativity but the least ambitious or thoughtful way is to say it’s because of culture. </p>

<p>There are so many other more poignant reasons than the language someone speaks or the country they come from. If the English values the natives as much as they values themselves, there would never have been a genocide. But as long as they saw them as other, and lesser, the genocide was inevitable. </p>

The extremists are a movement, meaning they gain support by supporting their arguments with truthful examples. They are not a truth, or a way that needs to be. Their hatred for us doesn&#39;t begin and end with them being from whatever country they are from. Their hatred comes from their lashing out to find someone to blame for the terrors in their own lives. </p>

<p>Who are the ones that hate us? They are the ones that feel the most. Maybe they are the ones that have also lost the most, or the ones who have the instinct to protect. THey don&#39;t hate us from their bones, because they were born to be our enemy because of who they are. THey hate us because they have been taught to hate us. </p>

<p>We are more than them. they can be flipped. we are more than the people who would hurt others.

But they don&#39;t want to hurt us just because of who they are, that&#39;s an idea that is planted in our heads by people who have no value for the individual lives of each and every human on this earth.

<p>This is what drives me bonkers about the kneeling athletes.  They have millions of dollars but do narcisstic &quot;protests&quot; instead of investing 90% of that insane wealth into the poor communities they grew up in.  Start charter schools, rec centers, community gardens, health clinics, music and art lessons, teach classic literature and tutor kids on how to think and write and debate.

<p>And let them protest. Remember, they are just people that have made it big, and they still feel all the pains that poor people feel, they still have all the quirks and inadequacies and even they with all their money can feel helpless. Rodney Dangerfield said on an interview with Johnny Carson that you&#39;ve got the same head no matter how much money you get. </p>

<p>I like some of the ideas you have they are powerful starting points. Imagine if they knew they could do this, if they had the infrastructure, the knowhow, the impetus? They have the money, but truth be told, a lot of people with money don&#39;t know what to spend it on. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, I agree. We need humans to focus on self-improvement and education to eradicate ignorance and weakness. Unfortunately its not reality for everyone. Many people lack something that drives passion in their lives or they get tangled up in other life problems, like having kids too early or having an abusive upbringing/mental issues.  </p>

<p>It&#39;s up to young leaders like us to drive innovation and that&#39;s why you see business leaders coming up with ideas like UBI. We are trying to prepare ourselves for an automated world and it&#39;s going to be very difficult to adapt. Money will have to be gone before that can occur. But nobody knows a better system. Capitalism is working for now, we just need to protect our environment more. </p>

<p>Your idea is the eventual &quot;sense of purpose&quot; but we aren&#39;t there yet. Your talking about what it&#39;s going to feel fulfil us spiritually when we no longer have to work due to automation. At that point though we have to worry about robots trying to attack us and/or our environment already being destroyed.
The onl only other way this would happen would be if humans had to unite against things like:
- asteroid Collision 
-changing environment/terraform mars
- pandemic
-alien invasion </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, I don&#39;t disagree with you, but hear this: It&#39;s not intelligence that results in leadership. It&#39;s a reason. It&#39;s passion. It&#39;s a desire. That&#39;s why stupid people are leaders, because passion is independent of brains. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t think one world government is even a necessity. I don&#39;t know why people (present company excluded) get so antsy, thinking that having peace on earth means a new world government. Just like <a href="/u/kickedinthedick">/u/kickedinthedick</a> said, there&#39;s a difference between globalism and globalisation that most people don&#39;t differentiate. There are people in this thread talking about how I&#39;m speaking the words of satan if I want peace on earth, etc. </p>

<p>So the problem with inherently distrusting government - it means that you&#39;ll never be motivated to change things from within, and instead of understanding how to build a perfect governing system, the tendency is to reject it at all, and to see well meaning things with malintents, and see common shortcomings as intentional malicious acts.</p>

<p>There is no need to break up the current system of countries and borders, but there is a need to make peace among countries. I think if you follow what I&#39;m saying you see that I&#39;m not calling for a one world government. </p>

<p>Instead, I am calling for people to realize that becoming one human people is not as bad as it sounds from all the pundits, and it is within our grasps, regardless of location and resources. But it will take dedication and soldiering for peace. </p>

<p>I think that ignores all the positive effects of forming a collective. For example, you pay taxes to have roads. Some of which you may not drive on. But now you have the freedom to travel, which wouldn&#39;t be there otherwise, because if everyone&#39;s out for themselves then nobody will build a road network out of the kindness of their hearts.</p>

<p>You might pay into health insurance you&#39;re not currently using, but then you&#39;re grateful when you actually need it. Even Ayn Rand collected Social Security benefits, despite the hypocrisy.</p>

<p>Some people are against it because they’re racists and seclusionists.  I feel those people are wrong.</p>

<p>Others are not so much against a global community, but against one ran by TPTB that exist today.  These PTB are negative and manipulative.  You don’t want to give those types even more control of the entire planet than they already have.  This particular viewpoint I don’t disagree with.  I’m personally all for a global community.  I think it will elevate the human species.  However, it has to be <em>the right kind</em> of global community.  Not just any will do because there is so much deceit on this planet that there are powerful types that will proclaim that a global community is “the best thing that can happen to the world!” and get many behind the idea, and all the while they are sowing the seeds of an eventual system where literally <em>everyone</em> will be enslaved under their manipulative, totalitarian rule.</p>

<p>That’s certainly not the kind of global community one should ever want.  It would essentially be a global community where everyone’s a slave.</p>

<p>I think the majority of people that speak out against a global community are essentially speaking out against this type of “global community” that can lead to the enslavement of everyone.</p>

<p>Of course there are also the ignorant racist types that I mentioned initially, but that’s another type altogether.</p>

<p>Absolutely and 100% agreed.  However, that means that we as a people have to step up to the plate, grow some serious responsibility, and all come together as one united people.</p>

<p>In other words, there are many potential pitfalls on the way to actually accomplishing the global community goal.  Agreed.  There are <em>so</em> many pitfalls, that honestly I’m not sure that the human species is at the point and level of sufficient evolutionary development to be able to accomplish the goal of the <em>right</em> kind of global community.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Like Einstein said - I don&#39;t know with what weapons ww3 will be fought with, but ww4 will be fought with sticks and stones. It&#39;s time to break that cycle and stop thinking war is an acceptable behavior.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Well, I’ll tell you that I certainly work on breaking that cycle within my <em>self</em>.  That’s certainly for sure.  I can’t speak for anyone else, however, and it seems we would <em>all</em> have to work together as one in order to make a global community really succeed.</p>

<p>I’m doing my part on a daily basis in terms of just how I look at the world and how I look at and treat my fellow beings, but I’m only one person and cannot speak for others.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>we need to begin to foster peace at the earliest stages in life, and begin convincing people who have given up on life that we can do more to change, we need to take the sense of mission and desire for something better and stand behind it together so that we can get anything done at all.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I fully agree with this…but the vast and overwhelming majority of us human beings on this planet - even the well-meaning ones, to say nothing of the assholes - are weak and ignorant hypocrites.  Like, for example, what you said above here…It’s nice.  More than nice, as a matter of fact.</p>

<p>However, with no disrespect meant toward you by saying this, I would bet a <em>lot</em> of money that you don’t even represent in your own life the very things you said here.</p>

<p>And that’s no slight against you.  It’s EXTREMELY difficult to <em>really</em> be a being of peace and <em>really</em> be an individual of responsibility and intelligence.</p>

<p>We harm and we kill on an almost constant basis on this planet.</p>

<p>I’m reminded of <a href="https://i.imgur.com/OMc5lzb.png">a quote I ran across a while back.</a></p>

<p>We have a <em>long</em> way to go as a species before we are ready for the proper and <em>right</em> kind of global community - much as I savor the idea itself.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s not proven that small groups evolve <em>faster</em>. It&#39;s proven that small groups evolve to suit their environments. The speed at which the birds on the island evolved had nothing to do with population size, but rather the environments and the attributes that increased fitness. A larger population would have also evolved if every sparrow was placed in a new environment. It can happen in the span of a few generations, it all has to do with fitness. But that&#39;s not an argument for people. It&#39;s a completely different scenario. We don&#39;t evolve as desert people, or plains people, or forest people, or city people biologically to a major extent, so it doesn&#39;t really make sense for having peace on earth, I just wanted you to know that. </p>

<p>There is some truth to humans being small tribe apes, it&#39;s always easier to manage things in small groups, obviously, but we don&#39;t lose that by accepting other cultures and learning and loving them. We gain by understanding people other than ourselves, and in fact, intermingling of cultures spurs ideas and change faster than isolation. Think of the silk road, and how the mesh of ideas from around the world lead to the renaissance, and how we advanced our knowledge by receiving algebra from the persians, and powder from the chinese, and how italians transformed their food from noodles from the orient, and etc, etc, etc. Exchange is better for people and genetic populations, than isolation. that is definitely a fact. You gotta realize being accepting of others doesn&#39;t mean you give up who you are. Being welcoming and opening yourself up to understanding others makes you a more wise individual.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Actually you are completely misinterpreting how the birds in the Galapagos evolved and making a patently false statement that it had nothing to do with population size.</p>

<p>If you study complexity theory and understand how emergent complexity forms, you will see the error in your statement. It is the smallness of the population that allows it to adapt quickly, not birds being put in different environments. The populations were small and isolated on the Galapagos, where as the mainland had &quot;more environments&quot; to evolve in actually, yet they didnt. They changed slower. </p>

<p>The big committe of birds got their work done slower because there were more of them to dilute the evolutionary process.</p>

<p>And in point of fact, sometimes, it <em>does</em> mean that we give up who we are to be accepting of others and not every &quot;difference or diversity&quot; is actually good or beneficial.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It is the isolation only. The size is irrelevant. If there were 10,000 birds on an island and it could support them, after a generation, the same mos fit birds would have been selected for, than if there were 20 birds on that island. Selection pressures are sexual fitness, ability to get food, percentage values of population, genetic migration, random mutation, and some other things. Size is not the driving factor, in fact the larger the population, the MORE genetic variation is possible. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You literally contradicted yourself in your own post...</p>

<p>If it was just isolation, why didnt birds on the mainland who have the same diet and live in the same type of ecological conditions evolve as quickly?</p>

<p>Because that &quot;some other things&quot; as you so scientifically put it is the key element of evolution itself: self organized criticality.</p>

<p>That self organized criticality happens slower with more organisms because traits get diluted in the larger population.</p>

<p>Population size was absolutely the enabling factor for faster evolution. The populations are isolated <em>from each other</em> as well, yet one evolved faster to specialize than the other did. </p>

<p>Not sure why you incoherently repeat words at the end there, but you should probably go back to school and learn what self organized criticality is and how it relates to evolution. You seemed to have missed those lectures.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Explain to me, in scientifically accurate terms, why the observable fact that smaller groups evolve faster is &quot;clearly wrong&quot;.</p>

<p>Do you understand why emergent self organized processes like biological evolution happen faster in different sized populations at different rates?</p>

<p>Saying &quot;youre clearly wrong&quot; and then failing to explain why is just you giving up because youre attempting to discuss a subject you arent well versed in. </p>

<li>Evolution always happens at the rate of one generation at a time. It cannot happen faster than that. So if that is clear, clarify what is unclear.</li>

    <div class="md"><p>Listen you&#39;re confusing pervasiveness as a trait with evolution. In any populatin a trait can become present from 0% to 100%. You are assuming that at 100%, it is evolution, but at say... 2%, it&#39;s not. This is where you must realize that even if 2% of a population contain a trait that increases their fitness, they are evolving. </p>

<p>If one generation passes on a trait that increases fitness, it is evolution. If after 10 generations, it reaches 50% of the population, it is evolution. If it stays at that population frequency for 1000 years because of equilibrium, it is still evolution. If selection pressures push that trait down to 2% of the population after one generation,  it is also evolution. If after one generation, it becomes 100% of the population, it is also evolution. Evolution isn&#39;t an end result. Evolution is a process. It is a process that happens over each successive generation, with the passing on traits suited or ill-suited to fit an environment. Evolution is not the end result of this. I am taking the time to help you. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Evolution is also non-directional. It doesn&#39;t get more advanced or less advanced. It simply gets more suited to its environment. </p>

<p>Since one contributor to evolution is random mutation in genes, one could say that an increased gene pool makes it more likely that particular genetic mutations will arise randomly in any given population. The more diverse the gene pool is, the more likely it is that a particular gene mutation will find its way through the entire population. </p>

<p>When you have isolation of a population of any size, you limit the gene pool. Another contributing factor to evolution is genetic diversity and migration. If you cut off migration, it means that all of the external forces acting on a particular population are applying evolutionary pressure the same on the entire population. </p>

<p>If you have a population that has fluid migration, very large gene pools, and extremely diverse environments, the species will evolve to become a generalist population. If you cut off a small group from the rest of the population, limit genetic migration, and decrease the population size, you run the risk of the entire generation dying off from the lack of ability to adapt, due to lack of genetically variable traits that can be <em>selected for</em>, or proven more fit for a particular environment. </p>

<p>So when you isolate a population, you create a genetic bottleneck effect. This means traits can spread as a percentage of a population more thoroughly than they can in more diverse groups. I think this is what you are referring to as evolution happening faster, and &quot;diluting&quot; evolution. What you are talking about is the dampening of the frequency of a particular trait. </p>

<p>In fields of flowers for instance, there is a population frequency of purple variants, vs yellow variants. Environmental pressures like bees, can make it so that purple flowers are preferred to the yellow flowers, but other insects make it so that yellow flowers also exist, at a lower percentage of the population. </p>

<p>If you create a new environment, and eliminate all the bees, then you will find that the entire population may turn yellow unless another creature fills the niche of pollinating purple flowers. </p>

<p>In any case, the rate of trait distribution changes with each generation due to the environmental pressures, whether there are 10 or 10,000 flowers. </p>

<p>If you took only yellow flowers to an island with bees and no insects, and the bees didn&#39;t like to pollinate those flowers, the entire population of flowers could die out, unless there is a random purple color mutation or variant that occurs. Then all the bees will pollinate that flower, and purple flowers will subsequently spread throughout the island as the most fit offspring of that purple flower. The rate of evolution is always occurring at the same exact pace though, and the population size is not really a major determining factor. It is the diversity, and migration and selection pressures and various other elements that have an impact on any given population. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>First paragraph: Except that it absolutely does get more advanced(complex). Life originated as very simple organisms, and evolved into more and more complex forms over time. Dont conflate feedback loops, which are an integral part of evolution, for non-directionality. Evolution doesnt really go in reverse, otherwise youd see mitochondria and chloroplasts devolving back into separate bacterial cells from which they originated, or birds reverting to dinosaurs.</p>

<p>Second paragraph: More organisms means more mutations, but it logically also means that some specific mutation is <em>less</em> likely to find its way through the entire population, because that population is larger! It therefore decreases the likelyhood of any given mutated trait being able to change the species at large.</p>

<p>Third paragraph: &quot;When you have isolation of a population of any size, you limit the gene pool.&quot; Isolating a population of any size? If its the entirety of the species, then thats obviously not true. And according to you, a population of organisms being smaller or larger has the same rate of mutations, but evolutionary pressures cause traits to spread &quot;more thoroughly&quot; in a smaller one. </p>

<p>Except that evolution is more than random mutations spreading through a population. Thinking thats how evolution works is like thinking a tornado can hit a junkyard and make a Ferrari appear. Its a self organized emergent process. The echolocation of a bat requires the simultaneous evolution of specialized ears, the ability to make the sounds to echolocate and a neurological system capable of processing it.</p>

<p>Hence, random mutations are not enough. Complexity self organizes in life just like it does in nonliving systems(coalescence of matter into stars and planets etc). And thats where the feedback mechanisms in evolutionary systems generate increasing complexity(more advanced forms from simpler).</p>

<p>I suppose you could say: dampening the feedback mechanisms and ability for complexity to increase, and id agree.</p>

<p>The thing about the bees and flowers is a nice example of evolutionary pressure and selective forces, but the coevolution and coordination between species isnt really what we were talking about. </p>

<p>That and not all species migrate, and introducing species into an ecosystem can and does often cause catastrophic failure of that ecosystem and destroys indigenous species... kind of makes a good case against globalization really. </p>

<p>Not all species migrate, nor do they coexist with other species. Cane toads, fire ants, killer bees, parasites that proliferate and destroy entire species... history is full of cases where invasive introduced species destroyed delicately balanced ecosystems.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Let&#39;s take this one step a time. Complex and advanced are not the same thing. E-coli is perfectly suited to its environment, as is rice. Rice has more active genes than a human being, a nematode has more active genes than an earthworm. Complexity and advancement are artificial constructs. If you think you are more advanced than a fish, just try switching environments for a lifetime. You will lose. Evolution does not have a direction. It is measured in fitness levels.</p>

<p>Secondly.. i am fine with teaching you about how evolution works, but will you stop challenging me with your own little theories? They are very incomplete and demonstrably so. If you want to book a block of my time, I can have this converstion and explain to you where your theory goes against all forms of analysis, and is quite an incomplete model of evolution as it is accepted today, but if you want mentoring come to me in a private message. I can sit here and write a chapter of a text book explaining to you, for the sake of Karma, or just pm me and I&#39;ll share with you everything I know so that you can get on the same page with the rest of demonstrable science regarding the processes of evolution.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Concepts for you to develop: </p>

<p>Closed system evolution and open system evolution</p>

<p>Calculating allele frequencies</p>

<p>Case study: Genetic bottleneck in tropical islands</p>

<p>Case study: Evolution of HIV resistance in a host</p>

<p>Evolution in complex traits</p>

<p>Evolutionary pressures: Sexual selection, gene pool diversity, random variation, DNA mutations, calculating fitness levels.</p>

<p>According to evolutionary theory, a bat could reasonably evolve echolocation as follows: </p>

<p>Rodents squeek. Bats are rodents. Some rodents are born in the dark. Some of those rodents found that they could hear their squeeks reflected off of objects in the dark. This rodent that &#39;see&#39; items in the dark is more fit than other rodents. They die, they don&#39;t mate as much, because the rodent that hears its echo doesn&#39;t die as easily. </p>

<p>This rodent mates, and has 20 offspring. 10 of the offspring do not share the same ability to hear, and they die, their genes: deleted. The 10 remaining can also hear reflected squeeks off of objects, and each to a varying degree. They all survive. The best ones of the bunch are most fit. All of the 10 surviving squeek navigators have 20 offspring each. </p>

<p>the most fit of the squeek navigators have 20  offspring, and 10 of them can squeek navigate better than the other 190 offspring. These 10 have varying degrees of fitness over the other 190, and they are most fit. They all have 20 offspring. The most fit of those 10 are now super squeek navigators, and the remaining offspring are bumbling around in the dark still. </p>

<p>Soon, each one of the offspring of the super squeek navigators are so much more fit to their dark environment than the others that they nimbly walk around in the darkness and have found they can eat more and mate more. Pretty soon, the only rodents left aoround them are super squeek navigators because the others get weak and die off. </p>

<p>Now every single offspring that they have vary from one another. Faces look different, ears are bigger, some are smaller, some are fat, some are thin. This is natural variation, and not considered a major mutation. </p>

<p>Ear size can continue to grow as long as it increases fitness, and pretty soon, the resolution of their squeeking can detect insects, because they squeek the best and their ears are the largest. Pretty soon, they are the fittest, and they take over the gene pool. </p>

<p>There hasn&#39;t been a major mutation yet, this is just random fitness in their local environment. </p>

<p>So one day, they also have a common loose skin mutation. This rodent begins soaring on its loose skin flaps from tree to tree. These aren&#39;t wings, this just a random genetic mutation. They happen all the time. Sometimes they&#39;re born with 2 heads. It doesn&#39;t help, they can&#39;t focus. They die. Sometimes they are born with 3 feet. Doesn&#39;t help, animals catch them easier. they die. Sometimes they are born with white skin. Doesn&#39;t help, they are easy for predators to find. They die. Sometimes they are born hairy, sometimes bald. Doesn&#39;t matter to predators, but the females like hairy rodents over bald. It helps. Hairy rodents become popular. </p>

<p>It goes step-wise, and it&#39;s not trying to be an echolocating genius, the complexity arises from increased fitness, not because it wants to be more complex. I mean this is enough. If you want to keep challenging me, you don&#39;t want to learn. I can&#39;t give you more, stranger. Not now, not for nothing. </p>

The &#39;hair&#39; example was exactly a completely made up feature to describe how sexual selection can select a particular feature if the opposite gender prefers it. It could be anything. Look at guppies. Hirsutism was just a fairly common glitch in gene replication that I picked it for arbitrary reasons. Other than that, everything I said is pretty feasible. The problem with you is that fuck sake you are tenacious as sh*T. </p>

<p>I hear people spit on globalism, and you are essentially making sure none of what I listed ever happens. You may think you&#39;re spitting on world banks, and governments stealing from people, but it&#39;s us on the bottom that gets hurt. ALWAYS. Why do people shy away from becoming a peace loving world? Why do people put the health of the economy in front of the health of the people? Why is paying for something always the biggest factor? We are paying for all our poor decisions with our inability to reach our potential. Why are so many people either willingly, or out of ignorance, against this?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think it&#39;s mostly because it seems to depend on the government forcing the issue instead of the actual citizens frame of mind. People in general tend to self-segregate into communities where they feel comfortable,  and there&#39;s nothing wrong with that. Given that humans are capable of knowing only about 150 persons maximum it&#39;s a little unrealistic to expect that we&#39;ll really care deeply about more people than that. Not that you wish people ill but there&#39;s only so much one can do to improve anyone&#39;s situation globally. Also given that laws affect places differently due to religious beliefs, personal beliefs and values, making sweeping legal changes tend to cause chaos.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think you missed my point. It goes against human nature to see the entire population of the world as your friend. Trying to make the globe&#39;s inhabitants &quot;evolve&quot; and see outsiders as insiders, ememies as friends, etc., is risky. The utopian ideal where everyone is friendly, everyone accepts everyone, people share resources and get along is a great concept and I get why it&#39;s desired. It&#39;s just unrealistic and forgets to take into account psychopaths, pedophiles, narcissists, murderers, rapists, etc. NO ONE likes those aspects of humanity. But they exist.

    <div class="md"><p>I would recommend researching groups that influenced the modern day &quot;alternative&quot; conspiracy culture, like the John Birch Society, which Alex Jones was a member of. They were against globalism, the CFR, World Bank, etc. A stance I can agree with. But I don&#39;t agree with their motivations. They have far right views, bordering on fascist. They&#39;re extremely nationalistic, which makes them oppose globalism and outside influence. Sort of a mish mash of libertarians and neo-fascists. They hate communism, globalism, and even the federal government because of that strong sense of rugged individualism, and that brand of conservatism heavily influenced modern day conspiracy culture.</p>

<p>The irony is that because these groups were so anti-communist, many were seeded or started by the CIA.</p>

<p>If you want to follow the money trail back to the CIA, I&#39;d recommend searching &quot;John Birch Society&quot;, &quot;Roy Cohn&quot;, &quot;Western Goals Foundation&quot;, &quot;World Anti Communist League&quot;, and most importantly &quot;John K. Singlaub.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Because the reason for the push towards globalism is so rich can outsource costs, labour and pollution to the poor while hoarding the profit. It&#39;s essentially a propaganda tool to ease world transition into being ruled by corporations.</p>

<p>I&#39;m all for cultural exchange and free travel, those are good for cultural and thought diversity. But the word diversity itself has been twisted. Diversity is not a world where all people are blended into a soup, all consuming the same foods, same entertainment, same culture, a monoculture, but somehow that is the globalist definition of diversity. </p>

<p>Independent nations and thousands of tribes/cultures all with their own way of doing things and free flow of information between those is true diversity. In such an enviroment ideas and innovations flourish by the natural law of edge effects: <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edge_effects">https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edge_effects</a></p>

<p>For an example of how this is true, two of humanitys cultural Golden Ages( and imo probably the high points reached so far in culture) happened in places where the norm was independent city states all with their own cultures interacting and trading, those two being ancient Greece and renaissance Italy. </p>

<p>On the other hand Rome flourished while it expanded and clashed with other nations. Once Pax Romana came and those nations had been subdued and swallowed up in the Roman monoculture the empire declined and collapsed. </p>

<p>The globalist vision is akin to the roman one. The outcome if they suceed will be the same. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You answered your own question in your second paragraph. We don&#39;t have any of those enumerated conditions. What we do have is Empire attempting to masquerade as a benevolent force. Empire has co-opted the &quot;globalization&quot; terminology, but the outcome of Empire isn&#39;t more equal distribution of resources - it is the concentration of available resources in the hands of a few, while the many feel the lack thereof.</p>

<p>Globalism could exist as a net positive or negative for the humans living within the condition, but so long as one group of those humans continue to extract and hoard resources from the rest, the balance will always end up in the red for the majority. The nature of power is to become more concentrated with the accumulation of resources. </p>

<p>No sane human consciously shies away from peace. Negativity, anger, destructiveness come from a place of pain - humans expressing those emotions are broken somehow. No one consciously puts the health of the economy in front of the health of the people. When a coal miner goes in to the mine and ends up with black lung, he didn&#39;t do it so that &#39;Murica could thrive - he did it to support his family. When Monsanto poisons the water supply, it does it so that its shareholders can acquire more resources, not so that it adds to the GDP. The economy is made up of those millions of individual decisions that humans make to acquire resources. </p>

<p>It really does all boil down to the dismal science. I would love to hear how you think we might get from here to there, though. I&#39;ve spent plenty of time wishing the Enterprise would show up and beam me up to a saner existence, but it hasn&#39;t happened yet. So, while we&#39;re waiting, perhaps you have some ideas about how to get from the reality we live in to the utopia you&#39;re envisioning?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The problem with this utopian ideal is that you are skipping over the many, many steps that would be required to implement it with the results you desire.</p>

<p>To illustrate, think of your local community. Is there equal distribution of wealth? No poverty? No crime? No drug addiction? No bigotry? Do the education, justice and healths systems all run efficiently?</p>

<p>Most importantly, at the level of government is there a complete absence of corruption?</p>

<p>All of these problems become worse as you move upward in terms of centralized authority. The level of oversight becomes easier to circumvent the more you remove those in control from the people the serve and, as it stands, you need to be more politically cutthroat and unethical to survive at those higher levels. </p>

<p>At each subsequent level the politicians running the system are further out of touch with the needs and control of those who elected them, yet, you are suggesting that we move things up yet another level to a Global system.</p>

<p>It is not the concept itself that is bad, simply the fact that until we can fix our systems on a community level, then a metropolitan level, then state and finally national, we won&#39;t be ready for the challenge of a global system. Even in such a perfect situation (with efficient non-corrupt lower-level systems) it would still be a huge challenge moving up to that final level. As it is now it would be a disaster for the poor of the world, by which I mean about 80% of the population. You and I would probably fit into the lower level of the moderately wealthy and might do well enough as long as we turned a blind eye to the suffering of the majority and refrained from any dissident opinions but, even then, over time we would begin to see that block of comfortable 20 percenters shrink to 19% then 18%...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>in my experience the most powerful human connections are found in communities. Smaller groups working together for a smaller goal. Everyone has a voice everyone makes contributions. (I worked as a camp counselor and adventure course leader). </p>

<p>My fear is one, the people who actively push for the one world government are corrupt as fuck and want nothing for our own well being. Look at the geroegia Guide Stones. That’s a lot of dead people if those are the goals...
And two, we will begin to lose all sense of community as it grows to a global capacity.  </p>

<p>And lastly, your argument that we are “paying for all our poor decisions with our inability to reach our potential” is true but no due to our own fault.. The people who want the one world governments are the reason why we CANT do this now! </p>

<p>I want world peace too and people to see each other as brothers and sisters. But this won’t happen and I’m sure as hell not going to give up control to the NWO under this guise. It’s dangerous </p>

<p>And when the “aliens” attack and they start instituting this one world government for protections, it’s going to suck man. </p>

<p>Seriously, within our life time there is going to be a fake alien attack that will institute this one world shit. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Good question, I&#39;ve thought about this as well. </p>

<p>My opinion: while there will hopefully be a time when a &quot;one world community&quot; will exist harmoniously, without corruption, now just isn&#39;t that time. Look around, look at the world&#39;s top leaders in industry and politics. Their lives revolve around money, and power, and control. The extreme elite are only concerned with building and maintaining their own empires. These are the people in the bilderberg group, the trilateral commission, etc. leading the globalization movement. You&#39;d have to be a fool to think that they would give it all up. </p>

<p>People are assholes, and many would not hesitate to take advantage of a one world system, just as they take advantage of every other system in society. Combine that with the sheer enormity of such a project as creating and maintaining the harmony of 7+ billion souls, and it&#39;s not looking good.  To me, it&#39;s clear that we aren&#39;t ready, and as depressing as it is, we might not ever be. To aim for a one world utopia would be to aim for perfection, and perfection is the opposite of good. We can&#39;t aim for perfection because it will never happen. </p>

<p>I could go on and on about this, but I&#39;m just rambling. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m rather confident that the people of this world are in support of this idea. Pretty sure, it is those that we&#39;ve given the power of decision making. A determining of &quot;pecking order&quot; within the world ecosystem is what most likely is holding us back. Most every country in the world has pride for where it has come from and a want/ need to be included in decision making on a larger scale. Also, a local/ national policy change that is encouraging on a global scale may not be very popular with those that stand to lose anything they feel entitled to locally along the way. 
Being a little more involved in our own realities and worrying more for who we each choose to be can begin to give every one else the space to be who they choose/ need to be and begin to limit the friction we seem to all be feeling for each other and our personal opinions:)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, I agree. We need humans to focus on self-improvement and education to eradicate ignorance and weakness. Unfortunately its not reality for everyone. Many people lack something that drives passion in their lives or they get tangled up in other life problems, like having kids too early or having an abusive upbringing/mental issues.  </p>

<p>It&#39;s up to young leaders like us to drive innovation and that&#39;s why you see business leaders coming up with ideas like UBI. We are trying to prepare ourselves for an automated world and it&#39;s going to be very difficult to adapt. Money will have to be gone before that can occur. But nobody knows a better system. Capitalism is working for now, we just need to protect our environment more. </p>

<p>Your idea is the eventual &quot;sense of purpose&quot; but we aren&#39;t there yet. Your talking about what it&#39;s going to feel fulfil us spiritually when we no longer have to work due to automation. At that point though we have to worry about robots trying to attack us and/or our environment already being destroyed.
The onl only other way this would happen would be if humans had to unite against things like:
- asteroid Collision 
-changing environment/terraform mars
- pandemic
-alien invasion </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well explaining evolution, emergence and complexity theory like someone is 5 while being tipsy is kind of a tall order.</p>

<p>Do you understand how crystals form? Lets start there.</p>

<p>A solution of say, salt water is just a mix with no real order. The solution will behave like a liquid. If you let salt water dry, through dehydration and <em>self organization</em>, salt crystals will form in a regular way.</p>

<p>That is to say, salt crystals have a predictable structure. They may be somewhat unique at a large scale, but their underlying structure coalesces into being in the same way every time. Its complexity emerging from seeming chaos, <em>because of the way the atoms arrange themselves because of their own fundamental properties like their orbitals and bond angles</em>.</p>

<p>The basic underlying nature of sodium and chlorine(the constituent elements of NaCl table salt) gives rise to the structure of the crystals.</p>

<p>Well wtf does that have to do with evolution? Its the same process but with more variables than two atoms and their underlying atomic structures. Yet, complexity forms from seeming randomness: stars from coalescing hydrogen, planets from coalescing dust in a stars accretion disc, and so on right down to life itself forming and then evolving into different species, each either being well adapted and surviving and continuing to evolve, or going extinct as most of the species that have ever existed have gone extinct.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Listen you&#39;re confusing pervasiveness as a trait with evolution. In any populatin a trait can become present from 0% to 100%. You are assuming that at 100%, it is evolution, but at say... 2%, it&#39;s not. This is where you must realize that even if 2% of a population contain a trait that increases their fitness, they are evolving. </p>

<p>If one generation passes on a trait that increases fitness, it is evolution. If after 10 generations, it reaches 50% of the population, it is evolution. If it stays at that population frequency for 1000 years because of equilibrium, it is still evolution. If selection pressures push that trait down to 2% of the population after one generation,  it is also evolution. If after one generation, it becomes 100% of the population, it is also evolution. Evolution isn&#39;t an end result. Evolution is a process. It is a process that happens over each successive generation, with the passing on traits suited or ill-suited to fit an environment. Evolution is not the end result of this. I am taking the time to help you. </p>
