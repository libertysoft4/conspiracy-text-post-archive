    <div class="md"><p>I am almost certain that the FE movement is not organic and is designed to waste resources studying bullshit. </p>

<p>Watch the documentary mirage men. Most alien conspiracy theories came from one man paid by the government to knowingly spread bullshit. HE would go to conventions and place ideas that he knew were wrong and people would spend time and effort chasing shit leads instead of pursuing real ones. </p>

<p>The FE movement came about hard a few years back. Lots of purposely bullshit arguments to get conspiracy theorists to burn effort in a way that they know will go nowhere. </p>

<p>Seriously if you see a user spreading FE ideas take a peak at their profile. </p>

<p>It will be filled with easily disproved nonsense. </p>

<p>When you emphatically prove its wrong they dont stop the keep spamming shit like they are copy pasting off a script. </p>

<p>They want you to waste time on FE and not pursuing real ideas. </p>

<p>This is a primo example of what I was talking about. </p>

<p>This idea has been debunked time and time again. Yet it continues to be peddled by the FE crowd. </p>

<p><a href="https://takethisskepticalblog.wordpress.com/2015/10/21/how-to-disprove-the-flat-earth/">https://takethisskepticalblog.wordpress.com/2015/10/21/how-to-disprove-the-flat-earth/</a></p>

<p>The tl;dr of the link I just posted was the above user is correct, if we perform this experiment from one spot and one spot only. </p>

<p>As soon as you and a bud perform this experiment the numbers dont add up. Joes world has a sun that exists in multiple places at the same time to make this work. </p>

<p>Another simple debunking of this idea is to ask yourself why the sun moves exactly 15 degrees an hour no matter where you are on the planet. </p>

<p>On a FE this would only work at the North Pole </p>

<p>Not exactly. He was referencing measuring once from one location, which is correct. </p>

<p>If you add in more locations though the math breaks down. </p>

<p>Do you agree or disagree with that? </p>

<p>I found that like debating FE stuff before. It illustrates my point. </p>

I also think it&#39;s interesting who exactly gets pushed to the forefront of these issues. I know flat earth stuff is pretty damn moronic from the get go, so you already have a lot of morons as the base that believe it, but Kyrie seems to be a really dense person with not a lot of intelligence. He&#39;s the perfect poster child for conspiracies if your goal is to discredit them. &quot;Oh, you think Trippet was the JFK shooter, and killed Oswald as a cover up, and Jack Ruby worked for the mob?

    <div class="md"><p>Flat earthers have been around a long time. The Bedford level experiments were done in the 19th century. It&#39;s an interesting rabbit hole. It actually stimulates my scientific thinking, because the truth is that I&#39;ve spent my whole life just believing the earth was an orb. I&#39;d never been to space and seen it myself. I&#39;d never done the scientific work on my own. I just trusted that my elders were telling me the truth. That the &quot;blue marble&quot; photo was a real photo.</p>

<p>This rabbit hole has exposed some interesting phenomenon that I&#39;d never seen, or never noticed. Like the fact that even when I&#39;m 40,000 feet up in an airplane, the horizon is still level with my vision, and not below it. Or that boats that go over the horizon can be brought back into view with a strong zoom lens. Or that some cities that should be over the horizon because of the distance can be seen on certain days under certain conditions, like a mirage. And of course, reading the scientific challenges has taught me a lot that I didn&#39;t know before. Cool stuff.</p>

<p>I&#39;m glad the FE rabbit hole is there. I&#39;ve learned a lot.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Basically, there is a whole agenda behind this alien phenomenon; it&#39;s not organic, more of a psyop.</p>

<p>First of all, the disclosure movement was founded on Rockefeller money - it&#39;s a covert product of the establishment, not a protest against it. Truthstream media has done videos demonstrating that the disclosure movement was started by the globalists.</p>

<p>They want you to think the govt has been trying so hard to keep all this alien shit under wraps (think Roswell) and there is an underground movement that has figured out something is up. But the truth is that they are only making it look this way, the disclosure movement was founded by the same people controlling govt. They want you to think they&#39;re trying to hide it and it&#39;s a real conspiracy, but it&#39;s absolutely not.</p>

<p>There is a drawing by Aleister Crowley of a demon he summoned named Lam, he put the drawing in one of his books - <a href="https://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/crowley/lam.jpg">here&#39;s the page from the book</a>, look familiar? These alien entities they are introducing to us through movies and what not is a form of predictive programming, a way for them to introduce us to the idea is something so we more easily accept it when it really occurs. They&#39;re introducing those interdimensional demons (like the one summoned by Crowley) as extraterrestrial aliens so that when they those demons are introduced into mainstream consciousness, we&#39;ll just think they&#39;re aliens.</p>

<p>Crowley, in case you don&#39;t know, is the Jesus of Satanists; he bragged about raping and murdering hundreds of children. He was pure evil but Satanists/people who sold their souls love him (he&#39;s on a Beatles album cover, Nick Jonas wears a shirt with Crowley&#39;s face, Jimmy Page bought Crowley&#39;s house after Led Zeppelin broke up, etc, etc.) The people in charge of our world are working for Satan, and introducing his minions to us as aliens is a part of their agenda. The Bible speaks on this as well.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The reason i can feel 99.9% sure that this is all incorrect without looking into it is that it&#39;s such a western way of thinking and doesn&#39;t represent the majority of the world population at all. Asians and Africans probably have different concept of what constitutes as a &quot;demon&quot; and the bible doesn&#39;t count for shit because it&#39;s all just a bunch of made-up stories that have been told over and over again in middle east and europe. 
Just to be clear because i did say that <em>all</em> of what you said was bullshit: Aleister Crowley was a real person and founded a satanic cult but he was just talking out of his ass about things he may or may not have actually believed (just like jesus did, if he even existed at all). Neither of them had any powers or heard the voice of any gods or demons because those are all things that human beings invented to help them understand the world they live in before they had the tools to do so more accurately.<br/>
If you want to believe in aliens, fine by me. If you think there&#39;s an advanced civilization living in the oceans a la The Abyss, I&#39;d say show me some evidence. If you think there&#39;s a secret society of satanists controlling the (western) governments, I&#39;d say that&#39;s far more likely but still improbable and even if it were true, it&#39;s only unsettling to think about what those very real people are doing as a result of what they believe. But please stop thinking that such people have any kind of actual celestial super powers because they don&#39;t. It&#39;s made up. We evolved from an ape-like creature which evolved from a squirrel-like creature which evolved from an amphibious creature which evolved from a fish-like creature which evolved from a worm-like creature which evolved from single-celled creatures which evolved from amino acids and nowhere was there a god or devil involved in any of that. 
Stop pretending like you know secret stuff that &quot;people aren&#39;t supposed to know because the powers that be don&#39;t want us to know&quot; and try to actually learn what there is to know from what we can deduce from the world around us. Every. Single. Area. Of science points in the direction that life is all just random happenstance and the only possible way that you can fit anything similar to the traditional western view of religion into our reality is to consider the possibility that we are part of a simulation that was &quot;designed&quot; by something of a much higher intelligence. And if you want to say that literally every single scientist on the planet (including all of those that don&#39;t belong to western society) are part of a grand hoax to cover up the fact that the christian concept of satan is real, then i would call you delusional in the very literal sense of the word.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>How do you suppose this works? How deep is it? Is every student of science already indoctrinated? Even the 17 year old high school girls who are obviously future biologists? Or at what point do they become part of the system that you refer to as &quot;they&quot;? Do you think every time any scientist makes a discovery, anywhere in the world that provides evidence that your theory is incorrect, some suits from some American secret governmental agency show up and not only prevent the scientist from publishing their results but also completely brainwash them? How? With some kind of men in black device? If &quot;they&quot; have the ability to do that to any scientist anywhere then why not just do that to everybody? In schools for example? 
The reality is much easier (and much sadder because it doesn&#39;t sound like a cool mystery thriller): &quot;they&quot;, being a majority but by no means the entirety of (American) politicians, take money from lobbyists (this practice is forbidden in many other parts of the world) and, yes, some scientists are probably bribed or perhaps even threatened to withhold evidences or tweak their findings, but not to cover up some secret plot of demons to take over humanity which was foretold by people 2000 years ago that constantly practiced incest and slavery, but instead to save face for large, companies turning a huge profit by exploiting the planet and the people... Oil/coal companies, pharmaceutical companies, arms manufacturers... They&#39;re making money off of fucking up the environment and our social system and they only way they can get away with it is by keeping society as uneducated as possible/acceptable. Funding for education is shit. There are enough distractions to keep people feeling content and unwilling to try and see past the curtain that they&#39;re being used. But it&#39;s all only for economical gain and has nothing to do with religion.</p>

<p>And, in fact, if they were trying to hang out on earth and hide from humans while they want to park their space ships and eat lunch, doing it at the bottom of an underwater trench is smart.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you want to research it, I&#39;ll give you the means, look up on zillow or something like that see when the land on your neighborhood mattress firm/mattress one was last bought and the current market price for that land. Report back I would love to hear what you find out. </p>

<p>My thought is that someone buys land on the outskirts of a growing town, they sell mattresses to cover some costs of owning the building/lot and then when the land prices double or triple they sell the land and buy more again on the outskirts.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oddly enough, this is something I learned  about in a hospitality course while getting a business degree. The same thing happens to other franchises like McDonalds. When there are multiple franchises near one another, it’ll boost overall profits. </p>

<p>Think about it this way... with only one McDonald’s, it will get 100% of the market. Whereas, with two McDonalds, there is twice the exposure and increased advertisement. McDonalds #1 no longer gets 100% of the sales, but it’s also not getting 50%. It’ll sit between 65-90%. Now, rather than McDonalds making 100% of the profit in one town, they are getting the combined amount between two McDonalds (130-180%). </p>

<p>This seems odd if there are multiple owners, but typically these stores are franchised and ran by a single person/group.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks for the insight.  That makes sense.  The problem I have with this would be the fact that the stores I see (granted, a small sample) aren&#39;t even remotely busy enough to warrant another location, whereas your McD&#39;s example could easily see enough business/traffic to sustain another store nearby.

    <div class="md"><p>I mean it literally says in the first post how much mattresses are marked up. There&#39;s nothing expensive in a mattress, box spring, or headboard. Plus any &quot;insurance&quot; that goes along with it. There&#39;s not a heavy resell of used mattress market either since who wants to sleep on other peoples beds due to random things like blood, body fluids, what people typically do in beds, etc.</p>

<p>It makes 100% sense especially when you consider that most grocery/super markets/etc are based on models that make about 2-5% profit if even that.</p>

<p>The amount of startup money  it takes to make a mattress shop is so low, that anything you sell makes it worth. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Minimum wage is $7.25/hour in my state. That&#39;s $290/week. I can&#39;t speak with authority on rent, but electricity is going to be around $30/week. So our target is $320/week, plus rent and any startup costs.</p>

<p>I&#39;m guessing now, rent might be $1000/month, or $250/week. Startup costs might be high, but since you can expense everything you&#39;ll make a lot of it back at tax time. Especially if you can sell a lot that first year that you&#39;re open.</p>

<p>Another poster said that startup costs might be $50,000+, or $960+ per week.</p>

<p>Our new target is $320 + $250 + $960 = $1530/week. </p>

<p>Mattresses start at $99 for little more than cardboard, but assuming you aren&#39;t setting up shop in a poor neighborhood, the minimum target price is going to be around $599. Three of these mattresses a week puts you in the black. Year two, you no longer have the startup costs, and $570/week puts you in the black.</p>

<p>All plus or minus a little, and not including the actual price of a mattress which is probably $100 or less.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Dude I don&#39;t wanna be the guy to burst any bubbles, but say for example, you might sell 3-4 mattresses in a DAY on a slow day. A mattress is something people <em>rarely</em> purchase, because they are expensive and typically last a very long time. Still netting minimum 2k from those mattresses (probably more) and you likely employ a single person, maybe two on a shift at a time, so labor is negligible. And that&#39;s if you only sell a couple of mattresses. I&#39;d never expect a place like mattress firm to have queues of customers or to be &quot;busy&quot;, really, ever </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Dude...you&#39;re not really seeing the big picture here. Think of it like this, I bet wherever you are from there is a strip of road that has like 5 different car dealerships within seconds of each other. And literally everyday you see not a soul out there buying cars. The same cars are in the same spots for the longest of times and yet somehow those that own and operate these dealerships are usually well off and are not hurting for money. You see a ghost town at their place of business but then look at the streets during rush hour and see everyone driving a car. Well they all went out one day and bought that car and chances are you weren&#39;t around for the time that they were out there. Well everyone sleeps and that means at some point at least most normal people will purchase a mattress at least a couple to a few times along the way as the world goes round. And most likely, you were not around to see them when they were at the store buying said new mattress. A regular person will purchase a new mattress once every five or six years if that long. Will damage their product and have to buy another. Will move somewhere and not be able to take it and have to buy a new one. Now think of that rate of attrition and apply it to a country that is occupied by let&#39;s say 300 million people that will be those type of normal people that will buy a new bed every so many years. I can tell you that the numbers will read out that literally millions of mattresses are bought every year and despite millions upon millions of beds being bought by the everyday person, there are places like hospitals, prisons, mental institution, rehab facility, churches, hotels, motels, bed and breakfast, among other types of businesses that will also buy in bulk every so many years as well. That translates to tens of millions of mattresses being bought and sold in just this country alone each year. And yet I bet you&#39;ve never actually seen anyone buy a single mattress right? Well maybe now you&#39;ll have some sort of actual perspective about how lucrative the sector of necessity enterprises can truly be. Everybody has to sleep. They don&#39;t all buy beds but a very large number of them do. Now think of the fact there are 6-7 billion human beings who all have to sleep on the planet today. And yet somehow you wonder how a mattress wholesale providor stays in business....it should be like so freaking obvious...</p>

<p>Say you&#39;re a beer kiosk at the beach. First day, you set up camp in the center, and get 100% of the clientele. The next day, a competitor appears. You go to ~33% of the distance and he goes to 66% so that you both cover your halves. Then the next day he realizes that if he were to go at the midway point instead, he&#39;d get more than half the clientele if you were to remain at 33%. Then the following day to fix your mistake you realize the optimal position for you is to also go at 50%, leading in the both of you right next to another.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There’s an interesting and fun small article in this week’s New Yorker about a store in NYC called Craig’s Beds, open by appointment only, and owned by (who else) a guy called Craig.  Craig had begun by selling mattresses over the internet.  But customers kept wanting to try out the mattresses before buying.  So he set up his appointment only showroom in an office building near Penn Station on the 6th floor.</p>

<p>Also, not everyone has a car, or a big enough car to pick up a mattress, and mist people want someone to take their old mattress away. Most places that sell matresses will do that for you.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I used to work at a furniture store, and had access to the &quot;cost&quot; of all the items we carried. A upper middle tier &quot;Stern&#39;s and foster&quot; mattress would run you about $3000 for a queen size. At cost it was roughly $700. Now another thing to consider, we sold &quot;protector pads&quot; for $80 each, and our cost was around $10. With both of that into account, there is still no fucking way they can sustain so many stores like they do </p>

    <div class="md"><p>So you basically sit there and do jack shit until a customer walks in. Typical sales pitch. Gain rapport, etc. typically there is only one person inside. Sometimes 2, but you pretty much do nothing but watch YouTube videos on your phone and/or listen to music. A typical month can net anywhere from 20-200 mattresses per store. Depends on the location. Also, that guy behind the desk wanting to sell you that mattress for $6,000 at what we called <em>full-pop</em> (full price) is in complete and total control of that price. Towards the lower end stuff, they can’t really discount it and they’re really not making anything. But that $6,000 bed is typically marked up an insane amount and it’s not hard to get at least $3,000 knocked off. The cost of each bed in the system is $699, period. And that’s just mattress firm as a company’s cap. Who knows what their getting it for from the retailer. If you push hard enough, you can easily knock it down to $2,500. They won’t let you walk without selling something. And if it’s the bed you want, don’t settle for anything less than at least 60% off. They’ll still get commission from it. It’s damn near criminal, and theft. Probably breaking a non-disclosure agreement by saying this stuff, but hey. I’ll deal with that if it comes down to it. </p>

Besides this, nowadays they sell mattresses with these new lifts that go up and down that also cost just as much as the mattress so they are basically getting 2x the $$$$$</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes this. I know someone that works at a Matress Firm and he is so sketchy and probably knows it&#39;s a front for something. When someone returns a mattress they are told to throw them away, instead of throwing them away he keeps them and sells them out of his garage for personal profit...but his garage is constantly full of mattresses...how can a company have that many returned mattresses if I literally never see anyone in the store?? He&#39;s selling more &quot;returned&quot; mattresses than the store probably is. I don&#39;t know but I know it smells fishy.</p>

<p>This is obviously not exactly what they are doing, obviously they may be distributing drugs and or whatever other illicit operation that they are in, but they also might just be buying property, holding onto it until inevitably the city sprawls out and the land value goes up and then sell off the property with little to no costs because the store covers costs. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Mattress stores have incredibly high margins, so they don&#39;t need much business to be successful.
Mattresses are a type of purchase that is very deliberately thought about instead of say, fast food, so the distance/location of a mattress store isn&#39;t as important. People will just pick the closest store. This allows the stores to rent at cheaper locations.
Mattress Firm recently bought out the 2nd leading mattress store in the country. because of this you are seeing situations where Mattress firms seems to be across the street from each other. This is because that USED to be MF&#39;s competition that is now just another Mattress Firm. These stores will likely be phased out if they are not profitable.

SimpleTruth is the leadership of the country had a huge conflict of interest while deciding how to respond - they made decisions alone and lied to both the common person and our elected officials to push those decisions through.

    <div class="md"><p>There&#39;s sure something odd about Catholic church finances.  I used to do some IT contracting for a Catholic school and parish.  They were dirt poor, almost never buying new equipment and having substandard technology in every aspect of the Church and parish.</p>

<p>I asked the business manager why there wasn&#39;t more coordination between parishes for group buys or some kind of centralization at the archdiocese level.  He kind of explained that the parish was pretty much expected to be self-funding <em>and</em> had to kick up money to the archdiocese.</p>

<p>Stranger yet was that while the school I did work for was an elementary school, literally right across the street and next to the church itself was a Catholic high school, technically part of the parish, that is probably top-5 in the metro area for all private schools, yet they had zero integration/cost sharing with the K-6 school across the street nor did the high school kick anything back to the parish.</p>

<p>My guess is that the whole Church all the way back to Rome works this way -- archdiocese to regional, regional to national, national to Rome (or however its tiered).  Even if only 1/2 percent of the money kicked up any one parish makes it to Rome, that&#39;s a lot of money, and it doesn&#39;t even begin to include the vast real estate holdings of the Church, some of which have to be making commercial rents (ie, not all of just used by churches or other religious purposes).</p>

There’s not really a “national” level as those are political boundaries that don’t mean much from a canonical perspective. You can have a conference of bishops of a country, we have the USCCB, but they don’t really serve a huge function as a group. Anyway, money in the Sunday collection basket is truly the lifeblood of the Church. Add in all the other perks of being a respected, historical group, and you get to make lots of $$$.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I just thought it was really weird that there wasn&#39;t even loosely organized group buys or even coordinated use of similar vendors between parishes.  </p>

<p>It felt more like it was organized as a &quot;cell&quot; than a hierarchical organization, with each parish on its own.  Perhaps a scheme that made sense a long time ago to ensure survivability if they were cut off or something, but now it seems inefficient and a potential avenue for embezzlement.</p>

<p>I remember on Mondays they had a bunch of older members counting money in a conference room.  I&#39;m sure it was no more than low thousands, but it wasn&#39;t Vegas-level security, either, and maybe 2 people had control of the cash past the count and they were also responsible for the bookkeeping.  It&#39;s not hard to see a skim being possible.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So I&#39;m going further into the Jesuit thing and as you know almost any search for Ignatius of Loyola&#39;s background yields the result that he was not a Marrano (not that I knew wtf that was until like 2 days ago), but a Basque or whatever. That seems to be a linguistic distinction anyway, but my question is how do we know that he and other original Jesuits were Jews? One of the most common results one gets when looking for this is a paper called &quot;Ignatius of Loyola and the Jews&quot; which I&#39;m sure you&#39;ve heard of, and which obviously even in its title distinguishes him from Jews. Same with his Wikipedia article, etc. I would expect there to be a cover-up at play here, obviously, so I&#39;m only asking how to find the truth among the possible deception.</p>

<p>how do we know that he and other original Jesuits were Jews?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We can&#39;t know for sure, but based on multiple clues, I find it very likely that they were. Of course they were trying to hide that fact, combined with historical revisionism, which would make it far harder to prove that they were.</p>

<p>One example of evidence is Chapter 15 of Book IV from Coningsby by Benjamin Disraeli, who was Jewish. In that Chapter, he somewhat casually mentions that the first Jesuits were Jews.</p>

<p>But sadly, with so many things, I think it is now impossible for us to be completely certain of the truth. We sort of have to trust our intuition.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Paul is dead but John Lennon’s alive (or at least he ways in 2009). A film came out called “let him be” that was about a documentary film maker finding John Lennon was still alive. The guy playing Lennon in the movie looks exactly like him and sounds like something putting on an accent. He also sings and sounds exactly like Lennon</p>

<p><a href="http://mileswmathis.com/lennon.pdf">http://mileswmathis.com/lennon.pdf</a></p>

<p>Also check out a video called David Bowie Death Hoax on YouTube. The guy looks like Bowie behind bad makeup and sounds very similar. He also says yhings like “David’s death feels like a part of me has died too”. Both these guys I’m convinced are Lennon and Bowie. Everyone else I know says I’m mad but the Lennon one in particular I just get a feeling it’s him. Doesn’t mean I’m right but I just don’t see how you could fail to notice the similarities between Lennon/Bowie and the people in the videos</p>

What if all the things in &#39;outer space&#39; are just parts of the flying saucer, like parts of our car, and we&#39;re actually(in proportion to these beings) the size of bacteria in our existance. We can only be seen under intense microscopes to their eyes.. so who&#39;s to say our bacteria don&#39;t exist the way we do? Many languages and religions and countries and wars and families and friends and jobs and currency and an economy?

    <div class="md"><p>Kind of like the shadow govt. in x-files making deals with the aliens.</p>

<p>The Cassiopaea material says there are two types of entities on each &quot;density&quot; of existence.  Service to self (STS) and service to others (STO). Allegedly the grays are cyborgs created by the reptiles/lizards to operate in the 3rd density (where humans live).  They are STS.  They serve only themselves, and feed on fear and conflict (and blood in the physical realm).</p>

<p>The breakdown of densities is based on the Tree of Life, with animals in the 2nd density (even though they are physically in the 3rd density, their perception isn&#39;t on the same level, just as we exist in the fourth density as far as those entities are concerned, but can only perceive the 3rd density except under certain circumstances, as through transcendental meditation and the use of psychedelics to pierce the veil). The 4th density is still physical, but time is not linear. The 5th density is where you go when you die, and recycle. Sixth density is more or less ethereal, and 7th density is the permanent return to the source of creation, of which we are all a part.</p>

<p>My grand unifying theory of everything is that &quot;magick&quot; is real, but is just natural science we don&#39;t fully understand.  The demons and angels are really interdimensional STO and STS entities.  </p>

<p>Aliens genetically engineered us to better feed and serve them, which is why the mixing of races was forbidden, but is now irrelevant after eons of interbreeding and natural disasters which have repeatedly destroyed human civilizations.  </p>

<p>The reason all pictures of UAPs are blurry is because they <em>are</em> actually blurry to the naked eye since they are inter-dimensional craft and use gravity wells (oversimplification and probably wrong terminology) to move.  Blurriness and invisibility are side effects of the technology.</p>

<p>All the mythologies are more or less accurate, telling the same story from slightly different points of view from different cultures with different languages.  If you ignore Zecharia Sitchen, there is still plenty of evidence pointing to his conclusions, but definitely not from his translations.</p>

<p>The Sphinx, according to geologists, is over 12,000 years old.  It is a relic of the age of Enoch.  Civilization was wiped out by the great flood, which was likely caused by a comet or asteroid impacting the ocean, sending so much moisture into the atmosphere that it rained for a really long time.  This also wiped out Atlantis and probably buried most of the evidence of most human civilizations.  Remember, fossils are actually incredibly rare.  And a worldwide catastrophe could erase everything.</p>

<p>Time is cyclical. But time also doesn&#39;t really exist outside of our density.  Sufficiently traumatic events can ripple though our time.  There&#39;s a story, which I can&#39;t seem to find again, about a man who would get sick every year on the same day starting in his teens or twenties.  He would get these migraines and see flashes of red and blue, and feel nauseated.  When the date passed, he was fine.  He grew up and joined the military and went to war.  One day, a grenade was lobbed his way.  As he attempted to escape it, it exploded.  He flew, spinning through the air, and saw red (through his eyelids) and the blue of the sky as his eyes involuntarily blinked or something.  He survived and recovered, and on that date, never got sick again.  Allegedly this was so traumatic and painful that the event rippled backward in time, and instead of experiencing all the pain and fear and trauma at one time, it was shared throughout his earlier life.</p>

<p>As far as cults are concerned, I think there are lots of them, and the most powerful people in the world are involved, if not directly, then indirectly with belief in and knowledge of what they are doing.  I believe most of these cults to be STS, since they sure as shit aren&#39;t trying to help anyone but themselves.  I give credence to the who pedogate/pizzagate thing based on this.  The whole spirit cooking thing is a giant red flag to me as I am a practicing (learning) occultist.</p>

<p>I think the MIBs are not govt. but are 4th density projections meant to scare you.  I think they are largely powerless if you can manage not to let them scare you, but I haven&#39;t encountered them myself and might shit my pants if I did.</p>

<p>I have definitely encountered entities hanging around people practicing the occult in ignorance in my earlier years.</p>

<p>One other thing I believe but have no way of proving, is that psilocybin mushrooms in particular work as a poison to attached entities, and that they also tap you into the worldwide living web, which is where all that information that races through your head when you take them comes from.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I remain quite skeptical.  I&#39;m not going to join a cult that promises to take me on a mothership or anything anymore than I&#39;m going to run back to the Catholic church to embrace their dogma.</p>

<p>I wrestle with how crazy it sounds on a daily basis, but I remind myself that even in lies, there is always a kernel of truth.  What then of mythology?  Are we expected to believe that our ancestors spoke purely in metaphors until the modern age?</p>

<p>There&#39;s something to it, and I may be wrong, but I will keep following up with it if for the simple fact that there is a voice in my head constantly telling me to let it go.</p>

It&#39;s taken years to piece this hypothesis together, and I ignore a lot of shit.  Rather, I read a lot of bullshit along the way that doesn&#39;t smell right.  There are consistencies over time that lean me more toward one hypothesis than another.  Stuff that stands up to just enough scrutiny not to dismiss it.  Repeated stories and events or phenomena.  It&#39;s kind of like hunting, when the hunter senses the animal before they see it.  If you read enough different stories of high strangeness, you start to get a sense of it.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>When I take them, I get this feeling on the come up that something inside me really doesn&#39;t want me to take them.  Like, whatever it is, is angry and scared when I take them.  That&#39;s a strange feeling to have when you&#39;ve only had positive experiences on psilocybin.  I take them alone because I treat them as a sacrament.  Like the body of Gaia, to communicate with Gaia.  </p>

<p>And I know this bit just sounds like Guardians of the Galaxy II, but what <em>if</em> the idea was right, that the planet becomes conscious first, as a celestial body, then propagates life, and eventually more and more complex creatures until it propagates a species that is also conscious?  Maybe that&#39;s why religion is so ingrained in humans.  But over the millions of years, there may have been many humanoid civilizations on this planet, that every so often gets  wiped out by a planetwide catastrophe.  The matrix <em>is</em> the planet, and we are the simulated life of the prime consciousness of Gaia?  That&#39;s something I&#39;ve only been rolling around for a couple of weeks.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s really interesting. When I get that anxious feeling on the come up, I&#39;ve often thought of it as my ego panicking – it knows its losing control and it&#39;s not happy about it. And when I enter rough patches in hyperspace it sometimes feels like I&#39;m confronting my conditioning and programming, and I&#39;m being granted an opportunity to transcend them. </p>

<p>I too subscribe to the Gaia theory...I feel like I&#39;ve directly experienced it through psilocybin and DMT. And as our cells are us, so we are Earth/Gaia. </p>

Yes, there are literally a lot of fossils, but fossilization as a ratio of all the creatures who have ever lived is exceedingly rare.  There are more fossils of invertebrates because those are the creatures most likely to end up in a sedimentary layer.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>If a cult forms around what I&#39;ve put together, it won&#39;t be led by me.</p>

<p>Some people claim the Cassiopaean Experiment is a cult.  It is not, but the <em>claim</em> that it is has been tied to a CIA asset who infiltrated their group.</p>

<p>I think plenty of people have also claimed that the Ra Material and people surrounding it are a cult.  As far as I know they aren&#39;t.  </p>

<p>Now, Castaneda&#39;s remaining followers have this thing called Tensegrity, which from what I understand is supposed to teach people the movements the sorcerers of old used to enter and communicate with the Spirit World/Umbra, etc. using it to pierce the veil.  Their website kind of strikes me as cult like.</p>

<p>Regardless of how true overall each one of these groups information is, there is a certain amount of truth to be found and put together in each that paints a clearer picture of what&#39;s happening in the world.</p>

<p>The scary thing is that &quot;forbidden&quot; artifacts, biblical stories, mythology, and most importantly, modern science, all contribute to verifying the story.</p>

<p>If we&#39;re a species with amnesia, I&#39;m merely a cell in the body of the whole working to help the brain regain its memories, while holding an awareness that once I have those memories, I have to deal with that new reality.  That&#39;s actually something Don Juan Matus warned about.  Once you know the predator, once you regain your cloak of awareness, you have not reached the end of you journey, but the beginning, and you must deal with the predator, as you will both be aware of one another and have to navigate the same space, and your awareness is food for the predator.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s really a long story so I&#39;ll keep this short. I got a job working for a cult. Said cult has a furniture shop. The boss of said shop is a genuine asshole. Some of them were nice but in general the men were racist assholes. Normally I&#39;m not a judgmental person but these people are shady as fuck and in my eyes are a huge question mark on the grand chess board. Narrow minded hard core collectivists. Isolationists, Materialists. Nepotism. Inbreeding/Possible eugenics program. German. Huge farming operations. Communists. It was strange working for them and eventually the atmosphere got really toxic. I knew I wouldn&#39;t be working there forever so I decided that before I quit or got fired I would fuck with them and try to get as many to leave the cult as possible and hopefully to demoralize the rest. And fuck with them I did. Subtly at first and overtly in the end in an epic take this job and shove it moment. That night I was attacked by two shadow people. They came out of nowhere and it was the last thing expected. By attack I think they were just trying to scare me but being more fascinated than scared I stood my ground and they left.</p>

<p>The next day I was approached by two federal agents who wanted to question me. I&#39;m not sure whether they were sent to intimidate me into keeping my mouth shut, or if they wanted information about the cult. Either way I refused to talk to them without a lawyer. They asked me point blank if I was a terrorist and I laughed at them. A couple weeks later I was full on attacked by a hooded shadow entity with glowing red eyes, what could be described as a Jinn. It was the most terrifying experience ever. Like I could feel it feeding off my terror through my eyes... More on that in another reply...</p>

<p>This is an accurate picture of what I saw. A smokey billowing hooded figure with flaming red eyes. This entity terrified me, it manifested out of thin air and stared into my eyes with fierce glowing red eyes that seemed to crackle with energy. I could feel it literally feeding of my terror through my eyes. It felt like it was almost as scared of me as I was it. After it scared the shit out of me it communicated telepathically something along the lines of a warning that I had over stepped some karmic boundary, that it was testing my resolve and it was curious about my motivations and intentions. I think it was a Jinn because Jinn is the closest phenomena to being able to explain what I saw. It was inhuman but very intelligent. It seemed to be female. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>During this specific experience I was sober and completely awake though I will admit that I&#39;ve done mushrooms a number of times and that they are a huge part of blowing my mind wide open to the supernatural and paranormal. For two weeks before this experience I had been in an elevated state of mind (due to a intense &quot;dark night of the soul&quot; type event) that bordered on psychosis but by the time this experience occurred I was more or less back to a normal level state of mind. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is the most rational belief of spiritual conspiracy thought. While some cry doom, that we are controlled by every aspect of our reality, and others know of spiritual things but not the darker side, this acknowledges the universal penetration/creation of love but accepts that many chose to serve themselves and the hierarchy that entails. That&#39;s why the Ra material is so good, it&#39;s completely level headed and explains the light and darkness in a way that directly correlates to what we see and feel on earth.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve done that, and I&#39;ve had a telepathic conversation with an entity that I believe to have been Anansi.  (This was prior to having read American Gods and before the show was announced, so it was not a pop culture reference that might have triggered this.)  It was a giant wire-frame spider.  Like, size of a city block to me, huge.  I don&#39;t remember much but starting to ask a lot of questions then realizing I already know the answers but can only understand them outside of the corporeal body, and that when I return to cradle of existence, I&#39;ll again have all the knowledge I need to decide my next leg of the path.  It was comforting, like being safe at home.</p>

<p>Anyway, I prefer psilocybin to DMT for several reasons, including that psilocybin seems to be more of a teacher than other psychedelic substances.  I prefer to be able to become aware of my actual surroundings if necessary.  I can take time to experiment with concepts one mushrooms.  DMT is a different thing, and has it&#39;s time and place, but it&#39;s so fast it&#39;s almost a trauma to have that experience in that short amount of time.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>A Fomenko is famous for basically saying all of history is a fraud, a cover-up of a giant, globe spanning Russian civilization called the Horde or something like that. All of history as we know it has been rewritten to exclude and point away from this fact, for whatever reason. After looking into his methodology and how he &quot;matches&quot; historical figures and narratives, I don&#39;t really subscribe to the theory per se, but stolen and lost history is an intriguing subject nonetheless and there are other, more compelling things to look into.</p>

<p>Like catastrophism in general or specifically mud floods (theory is history is covering up the fact that civilizations are completely fucked and wiped out due to natural catastrophe more often than not.) Check out r/CulturalLayer if that stuff floats your boat. </p>

Much of which you can actually go and visit or view yourself,and would require tens of thousands of hsitorians to be falsifying carbon dating records, and tens of thousands of others manufacturing fake artifacts and structures, the real problem with this theory is that there is almost nothing to gain from falsifying hhistory.

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s an extremely huge amount of research - Basically, Fomenko traces the fraud and total lack of primary sources on many allegedly ancient civilizations and attempts to line up their encounters with various celestial phenomenon and other markers to create a coherent timeline - and he found out that no one had done this before, and that the previous timeline was put together, like I said, by liars and known agents.</p>

<p>It&#39;s all in the introduction to his book - there are a few podcasts I&#39;ve found, but none are very good.  I&#39;m also not very far into the book - Only 50 pages or so.</p>

<p>Fomenko himself is a career Mathematician, so he&#39;s trying to apply different mathematical types of analyses to history - and that&#39;s where he was able to verify the suspicions of many others - it turns out Isaac Newton, for instance, had written a book critiquing the old chronology - his work was called &quot;The Chronology of Ancient Kingdoms Amended&quot; - and there have been others over the centuries who have found the same things.  It was chiefly put together by a guy named Scaliger and his accomplice Petavius in the 16th century.  Many others have called out their frauds.</p>

<p>He comes to many extremely strange seeming conclusions and the book really is a trip - as is just about all of his research that I&#39;ve found so far.</p>

<p>Jan Irvin has a few podcasts on Fomenko material - they are ok as an introduction but even in 5-6 podcasts Jan Irvin is really only summarizing the summaries - still leaving out so much.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Here&#39;s a 1994 <a href="http://www.skeptictank.org/hs/atohate.htm">longform expose</a> that interviews both former members of his congregation and a few of his estranged adult children. One story that sums out how he both treated his family and alienated the entire congregation of his church (driving them away until almost no one remained but his own family) is:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>One from that time recalls Fred, Marge, 2 year-old Fred, Jr., and 10 month-old Mark were in the pews one Sunday with the rest of the congregation, listening to Cavin preach. Mark began squirming suddenly. To the appalled amazement of his fellow worshippers nearby, the junior pastor repeatedly slapped the infant across the face with an open palm and backhand, snapping Mark&#39;s tiny head to and fro. Afterwards, several of the men in the congregation confronted Fred and told him never to do that again. Mark Phelps laughs to hear that story relayed: &quot;My mom once told me-proudly, as if she&#39;d effected a big change in his behavior-that my father had beaten my older brother when he was only five months old. She said she&#39;d argued with him about it and he&#39;d agreed to hold off beating the kids till they were a year old.&quot; </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Oh, but here&#39;s a little anecdote that tells us how he really felt about his black clients</p>

<blockquote>
<p>During their teenage years, both Mark and Nate worked as law clerks in their father&#39;s office. &quot;When a black client was in there,&quot; recalls Nate, &quot;my father would play the &#39;DN&#39; game with us. It stands for &#39;dumb nigger&#39;. We would all try to use the acronym as often as possible in the presence of the person involved.&quot; In the 1983 interview with the Wichita Eagle-Beacon, Phelps intoned, echoing Abraham Lincoln: &quot;The air of the United States is too pure for racial prejudice to keep going, and the nation can&#39;t long endure half-slave and half-free. There is not any doubt that the problems of this country derive, in my humble opinion, from the way this country continues to treat black people.&quot; But according to his sons in California, part of the theology of the Old Calvinism Fred taught held that blacks were a subservient race because they were the sons of Ham, the son of Noah. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I conflated two anagrams.  UTH (ultra-terrestrial hypothesis), which is the hypothesis that UAPs/UFOs are terrestrial (from earth) from an advanced race of humans/humanoids that are either sub-terranian, sub-marine, both, or from the future.  IDH (inter-dimensional hypothesis), which is the hypothesis that UAPs/UFOs are from different layers of this dimension parallel to ours.  Basically that they are always here but we can&#39;t see or interact with them because of the limited capacity of our brains to pierce the veil between the two.  </p>

<p>In either case, the idea is that UAPs/UFOs are not interstellar or intergalactic.  These also meshes with the idea that our solar system is quite populated.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh yeah, we lost something for sure, specifically knowledge of astrology and sacred geometry, and whatever else was destroyed in the burning of the Library of Alexandria. Have you read Graham Hancock? I&#39;m a big fan of Graham&#39;s, and he&#39;s getting more acceptance as time goes on and his work around ancient Egypt and the comet/flood theory is taken more and more seriously.</p>

<p>Another writer who I love for his work on the ancient Gnostics and their understanding of vying alien factions is John Lash, who wrote &quot;Not in HIS Image&quot;- brilliant book. (Many of John&#39;s talks are uploaded to YouTube now too). </p>

<p>On the other hand, though, it seems that we humans today have something that we didn&#39;t have in the past, that could prove to be the game-wining technology, or at least I hope so: the internet.</p>

Originally a lot of what he was saying was speculation, later to be proven with evidence, but despite all this several professors and geologists/archaeologist say he’s not smart and that he’s a hack. It’s just really weird to me.

    <div class="md"><p>I think it&#39;s both. There&#39;s a lot of ego and clinging to old ideas that goes on in this society, especially among people who don&#39;t smoke weed, yes. But also the CIA has heavily infiltrated academia, probably more than Graham realizes. I would bet money that some of his most ardent critics, who spend a ton of time attacking him, are intelligence agents. </p>

<p>Regardless, Graham gets more attention and exoneration and time goes on. The scientific consensus seems to be leaning towards the comet-flood theory he detailed in &quot;Magicians of the Gods.&quot; </p>

<p>But in my opinion the most important book he&#39;s written is his psychedelic book, &quot;Supernatural: Meetings With the Ancient Teachers of Mankind.&quot; I don&#39;t have a lot of books that I call must-reads, but this is one.</p>

Personally, I don&#39;t see the need to write in cursive, but I do think it should be taught in terms of being able to read it. For some of us, especially those with ADHD/ADD, cursive just doesn&#39;t click in terms of writing. If all writing is done in &quot;printing&quot; all your life, it can be as fast as cursive for someone who mostly uses cursive. The only sort of &quot;cursive&quot; that ever stuck for me was the cursive italic by Getty and Dubay. If I think really hard, I can write my name in regular cursive that was taught to me in 2nd grade, but I never really used again. I can read cursive without issue, however. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Never heard of &quot;The universe is electric&quot;, but I absolutely believe there was no SINGLE big bang.  I DO believe in black holes, in terms of a very VERY large &#39;star&#39; that has long ago burned off the easy (exothermic) fuel (hydrogen), and is now just a really large ball of mass fusing heavy elements, until it eventually big-bangs itself.  I think dark matter/energy and string theory are all just exotic attempts at making explaining observations that dont match expected values.  In terms of understanding the universe, we are still in the dark ages.  1000 years from now, they will laugh at our &#39;big bang theory&#39;, the way we laugh at ancient theories from 1000 years ago.</p>

I think it&#39;s possible that we&#39;re just currently in one state of being right now between &quot;big bangs.&quot; Time is a constant cycle of matter ebbing and flowing in and out, and that we&#39;re in an infinite cycle of big bangs.

<p>There’s totally something there. You can combine the electric universe theory with simulation hypothesis pretty easily. It makes total sense</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The most plausible explanation I&#39;ve found for the Vegas shooting is that it was an assassination attempt on the crown prince of Saudie Arabia who got away. If you follow their news the next few weeks after were insane. Now they are letting women drive and allowing movie theaters to open up. It&#39;s a regime change for sure. But the US can&#39;t go to war over it because as a general rule the US is for the changes taking place. The crown prince wants to modernize. His uncles and former billionaire leaders aren&#39;t big fans and would rather keep with the old ways and suck up all the oil money. It&#39;s awful that innocent people got caught up in it. It&#39;s also awful the extent they have all gone to cover it all up.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Dress like a schlub to fit in with the schlubs. 
One attempt at explaining what happened said that the prince  went across the street to gamble and didn’t want any attentions I he dressed casual. The assassination attempt failed because it was unknown at the time that the prince was not in his room. 
I believe the prince was staying in the same hotel as where the shooting took place but was in the penthouse suite (which is subsequently owned by some billionaire of Arab decent that had some connection as well).</p>

<p>Not sure what to think regarding any of it tbh. There’s really no evidence to suggest anything strongly (this video being one of the most questionable pieces of evidence from the event imo). </p>

    <div class="md"><p>My running theory is that Stephen Paddock was doing something shady for the FBI/CIA/both. Probably illegal arms sales to cartels and other criminals. Unless you want to go with &quot;He stayed rich from video poker.&quot; As somebody said on that, &quot;You don&#39;t play video poker to make money; but you might play it to *launder* money.&quot;  </p>

<p>Paddock then snapped and shot the concert up, OR someone Paddock was dealing arms with set him up, killed him, and shot the concert up. One of the running theories on Option B is that this was ISIS, a terror attack.  </p>

<p>In either scenario, it&#39;s rather clear why the government would want to shut down probing deeper. What&#39;s really dismaying to me is how the media has just gone along with it. Basically, if somebody with an agenda isn&#39;t anonymously leaking something to a &quot;reporter&quot; simply taking dictation, the media is about useless.</p>

<p>Why should I have to? Why should I have to go take <em>my</em> time out of <em>my</em> day to go find the videos and pictures and livestream VoDs and firsthand tweets and interviews and etc etc <em>for</em> you?</p>

<p>Do your own damn research and learn to think for yourself instead of relying on others to do it for you. The evidence is out out there, you&#39;re just too lazy to go look for it yourself because you&#39;re either afraid of what you&#39;ll find, or you&#39;re not going to believe it no matter how damning the evidence is. So, even if I did go out of my way to get you your &quot;evidence&quot;, I already know you&#39;re going to tell me that it&#39;s all fake, and thus I will literally have wastedy time. </p>

<p>It&#39;s a lose-lose situation for me here, because either I get to do that, which, again, will result in you calling it all fake anyway, or I get to skip the bullshit and just tell you &quot;no&quot;, to which you will say &quot;yeah I thought so&quot;, and thus believe you have won this debate.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>Why should I have to?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Because you are the one making claims, so the burden if proof falls on you to support them. Either produce evidence that can be scrutinised to see if it does indeed support your claim, or retract the claim.</p>

<p>Alternatively don’t get so pissy when those who value evidence don’t take you seriously for failing to provide any.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Do your own damn research and learn to think for yourself </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Oh, the sweet irony.</p>

<p>Let me tell you what I know to be a fact. You are unable to produce proof of anyone “bleeding profusely” because the best evidence that exists for that claim is some grainy cameraphone footage of some anonymous fluid leaking out of someone’s clothing, which happens to be exactly how a theatrical blood pack would be hidden if it was faked.</p>

<p>You’re not even able to produce evidence that anyone or anything was shot at all, as joe_jaywalker has already demonstrated over and over again with his evidence threads.</p>

<p>So all you have left to support your perception of what happened is assumptions, assertions, appeals to authority, appeals to emotion, insults, ridicule and sarcasm.</p>

<p>Which is the same as saying: you have absolutely nothing of any evidentiary value whatsoever.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Tell me more! Lol what deaths are you referring too? And what is your stance on the Weinstein scandal? I did some minor research awhile ago into the victims. Conveniently, they were all Democrats. Odd what that means, but I had a hunch they were all pretty much in the same political party, which is what motivated them to take Harvey down. I have serious doubts about what he’s been accused of. More specifically, his relationship with Uma Thurman, that whole situation was just sketchy. They were clearly friends. He seemed genuinely shocked when she also brought accusations against him. Which, took her months to finally come forth with, by the way. She kept teasing that she was going to reveal what Harvey did to her.....almost like promoting it like it was a movie or something. Some crazy shit. I think the majority of it was all fabricated to dismantle Weinstein. Somebody wanted his position and company. Their is a reason people accuse people of rape.... because it’s the only thing taken seriously that can do serious damage to ones reputation (think rape, child porn, sexual harassment etc) its a well organized smear campaign </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well. It&#39;s true, I have learned what I know about the universe from school and mainstream science. When I look at the moon, I can see that it is a sphere by the way the sun lights up different portions of it, from new moon, crescent moon through to a full moon. You can literally see that the moon is a sphere. This is pretty solid visual evidence that bodies in space are spherical. It makes perfect sense that masses in space are spherical if you understand the principal of gravity.</p>

<p>I feel like you must have learned what you believe from conspiracy videos which is pretty shaky ground to educate yourself on. I&#39;m not even certain why you think mainstream would want to misinterpret the universe and pretend the earth was a sphere of it wasn&#39;t.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>cool story!!!...okay,now can you explain why there is a fairly sizable group of people that like to think of themselves as special and unique all of a sudden in a rush after the year 2015 or so on the exact same details of the exact same subject matter???how is it that,speaking for myself and tonnes and tonnes of others that have shared anecdotes and comments,we have lived on this planet for 3 or 4 or more decades and have made plenty and plenty of mistakes and had our memories proven incorrect many times over and moved on straight away and accepted it EVERY....SINGLE....TIME.......and then boom!!in an instant at an exact point we all became extreme narcissists of the most arrogant,self-involved kind and decided our minds are more powerful and reliable than the very fabric of reality........really??does that not seem ever so slightly off to you??</p>

<p>or does it just make you feel a whole lot more comfortable and settled to believe that we are all lying and have always been this way??going through life denying every single thing that contradicted our &quot;almighty&quot; memories....i guess it helps on your end cos then you dont actually have to think..so theres alot of time saved right there.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Basically it’s the widespread cognitive faltering of pop culture icons and masses of people remembering the exact same mistakes when it comes to spelling/facts of these icons. Example: the popular children’s series “The Berenstain Bears” is incorrectly remembered as “The BerenstEIn Bears” and everyone swears by it as the incorrect spelling. See some examples here: </p>

<p>Now what’s interesting about it is that this effect was not discovered until after the initial start up of the large hadron collider. Theory here being that the collision of subatomic particles may have actually launched us into an alternate universe, whereby masses of people remember certain facts as “incorrect”. Here’s an article (I know, I know it’s a Vice article) that explains it more:</p>

<p>Seriously. Last month  I watched it last month with my 9yo,  And I quoted the &quot;Kansas...&quot; line as well as the &quot;fly my pretties...&quot;</p>

<p>Do you think that the creation of the LHC is what people are claiming caused the effect?  its not the collider itself that would be responsible but something it triggered.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Why bother making the LHC if theres so many colliders already?  Its because LHC can do more than the others.</p>

<p>You dont understand the effect.  It doesn&#39;t matter if South Africans did not experience the effect.  Its only named after Nelson Mandela because it was the first documented instance that gained steam.  The effect is way bigger than just one guy.</p>

<p>Also, the effect IS real.  This is indisputable.  The cause is up for debate and yes it could be ignorance, but it could be something else as well.</p>

<p>The movie with Sinbad is probably the best example.  Thousands if not millions of people all remember a movie that never existed.... they aren&#39;t remembering a spelling wrong...they are remembering an entire movie and NO shaqs kazaam has nothing to do with it</p>

    <div class="md"><p>you should get out and about and do your own impromptu polling on the more &quot;significant&quot; M.E like ed mcmahon never giving checks for PCH,fruit of the loom never having a cornucopia,lindbergh baby found and killer convicted,mona lisa smiling like she on top of a dildo,sinbad the comedian never being in a genie movie and the &quot;thinker&quot; statue with a mushed up hand on his chin instead of a fist(on forehead)..and you will find its MUCH,MUCH,MUCH higher than 50%,closer to 90+ i would guess from my own experience and anecdotes from others...and i just ask some of the more obscure ones like desi arnez and sally fields names and interview with A vampire(one i am 100 fugging % certain on and will swear by till the day i die)..anyhow its practically impossible to find someone getting it &quot;correct&quot;.
so,alot of you guys here probably have a proclivity to lean towards being open minded to conspiracy theories and y&#39;all obviously know about M.E but i dont recognise any names in this thread as familiar in terms of commenting in mandela effect and retconned forums..i know you cant speak for others but is it just not something that takes your fancy enough to give it much consideration??</p>

My theory on Mandela is that people confuse him with Steve Biko, who did die in police custody. If you only half paid attention in an American social studies class, you&#39;d learn about both of them and it would be easy to mix them up later on.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What happened to me wasn&#39;t really a &quot;mandela effect&quot; by that sub&#39;s standards, they only consider it a mandela effect if it affects a group of people, but what happened to me only affected me and in that sub, they redirect those kind of experiences to <a href="/r/glitchinthematrix">/r/glitchinthematrix</a>.</p>

<p>Basically, a friend of mine was telling me about this video of Jimmy Page doing a show all fucked up on drugs, playing the guitar all messed up. A few days later I looked it up and watched the video. Then I told him I saw the video and it&#39;s funny but sad, and he had no idea what video I was talking about. I tried reminding him of the conversation but he didn&#39;t recall that part of it, and he never actually saw that video. Despite all of this, I&#39;m certain he told me about it and I remember it vividly. That&#39;s what changed my mind and I remembered the guy on the ME sub saying I&#39;d see when to happened to me.</p>

<p>Every morning I would walk my dog on the exact same loop, starting from my driveway. We would go up the street, turn right, walk down that street until we could cut through a parking lot to stay away from the major street that is about a half block further. One morning as I&#39;m walking him, that parking lot I&#39;ve used dozens of time was directly along the main street. It sounds so minor but I know for a fact this lot was far enough from the street to make it worth my while to cut through it. Now every morning as I cut through that lot I am sure to note exactly how close it is to that major street in case it flip flops on me. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The whole Walmart/Tunnels idea.<br/>
This makes perfect sense to me.  Walmart has logistics technology and processes are that the envy of the world.  They have locations literally everywhere in the US.  Massive supply chain.  I mean, think of how much food, water, clothing, medicine and medical supplies, optometry centers.  They cover 100% of what people would need in case of a major event.  With a few clicks, they can re-route tens of thousands of truck loaded with supplies.<br/>
Not only does it make sense to me, if I was the guy tasked with it, I would do it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>When it comes to conspiracy theories you have to play two truths and a lie. Oftentimes the truth is exaggerated or sensationalized for the purpose of disinformation or to draw more attention. Maybe there aren&#39;t secret tunnels connecting every Walmart in the country. But there could be at least a few. Or maybe it&#39;s the broader fact that the government has organized to use Walmart for distribution centers in the vent of an emergency. You just have to think about stuff like that. I personally believe a happy medium. I don&#39;t buy into truths and ideas 100%.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I <em>might</em> be convinced of the possibility that somehow they got secret permits and subterranian land rights to connect their distribution centers.  But as a midwesterner, I&#39;ve spent a lot of time in less than populated areas.  Any kind of project like that would be impossible to keep quiet.  Two people can keep a secret if one of them is dead.  The reason it would be impossible is because of the noise.  To bore like that, it&#39;s going to make noise.  </p>

<p>Now, I did say less than populated, but that doesn&#39;t mean devoid of humans.  Those living there would hear it loud and clear.  Maybe in a city the daily noise could cover it up, but not in the back country, and the wildlife would go insane.</p>

<p>In addition to that, where I live is just one example.  Here&#39;s a map of the aquifers of the US you&#39;d have to navigate around, assuming you&#39;d want to bore deep enough to avoid detection by way of noise.  Then there&#39;s the unpredictability of the types of rock, the removal of soil (all those dump trucks!).</p>

<p>I mean, I wish it were true, because think about how many jobs that would really create!  Although they&#39;d all be 32 hours per week at minimum wage with no benefits.</p>

There is a theory out there that the unexplained bangs and the high pitched noises that are happening across the country are from underground tunnel digging.  It was made semi famous because no one knows the origin of <a href="https://i.pinimg.com/originals/d6/fe/40/d6fe409d05aad337f3ec153f6be5773f.gif">this</a> map from like the 30&#39;s (check me on that).</p>

<p>The theory is that specific Walmart super centers were points of access for this tunnel system(s).  Walmart has several ties, and several contracts to government agencies.    </p>

<p>Given the era of space based monitoring, now, the only true way to hide military movements, locations and government happenings is by going underground.  Underground may have been fairly difficult in the past, but patents for the technology go back to 1852.  It&#39;s now commercially available and anything commercially available has probably been used by the governments/military (in several countries) for decades.<br/>
It goes on after that, but that&#39;s it in a nutshell.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> right ... ? What discussions in here are scientifically proven?</p>

<p>The pineal gland is scientifically proven to invoke altered states of consciousness (sleep) and has a long standing proposed correlation of being the metaphysical &quot;third-eye&quot; responsible for metatative states and achieving higher consciousness.</p>

<p>DMT happens to produce similar altered states of consciousnes and trace amounts are found naturally occurring in the human body. </p>

<p>Strassman connected these in his theory.  No, it is not proven, but it is not disproven either. That theory is intreagingly plausible ...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Strassman wrote a book that was part science and part philosophical conjecture. The problem is that many people read the entire book as if it was complete science. He might be correct in his conjecture, but even he says it is just that. The DMT at death and in the body was part of that philosophical conjecture part. Plausible yes, possibly true, but not proven like the other parts of his book.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve done plenty of DMT, I think he could be right, I just want to make sure we understand what we&#39;re talking about.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There is a bean (velvet bean or l-dopa bean) that is known for its high concentration of levodopa (l-dopa) at about 5% by weight. It is used as a medicinal for a number of reasons. </p>

<p>Interestingly, it also contains trace levels of serotonin, DMT, bufotine, 5-MEO and nicotine.  Too low to be used as a psychedelic.</p>

<p>When consumed, dreams seem to become more vivid and epiphanic.  Not sure why, but it has changed my opinion on what effect trace quantities of these may have on the sleep/dream cycle, and lends some credence to Strassman&#39;s theory.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sure, but the trace quanitities is his guess, he has no reason to think it. What I&#39;m saying is he wrote a book that&#39;s 50% actual science and 50% his new age speculations. Yet it&#39;s passed around like it 100% science. This has done more harm to the understanding of psychedelics than anything I can think of. So much misinformation because of that book.</p>

<p>Imagine if you had a physics textbook, and the second half of the textbook was the professor explaining how he thinks what he&#39;s learned about physics proves about metaphysics and the existence of god. Yet people kept acting like both parts of the book were equally scientific. Even when the author says they&#39;re not. That&#39;s what we have with strassman.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Balance is always needed. But for some people, disengaging for society could be for the best. For most doing this work, it can become an escape. It should be noted though that during the process of spiritual awakening, a lot of time and space needs to be set out for being alone and in silence (as best possible, depending on the person), thus some people disengage for a while, then return when ready.</p>

<p>In regard to gatekeepers - the truth is always found in your own experience, within and without, here now. Every teacher, book, lecture....is just a pointer.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I posted this when I saw this theory last time, I think its actually the opposite in that Hubbles daughter is Bills kid not Hubble is Chelseas father.</p>

<p>I base this on the fact that I can see Bill in Chelsea and that Hubbles daughter does look identical to Chelsea, and we all know how much Bill likes to stick his dick into anything he can.</p>

<p>Theres something there for sure, because they are indeed identical and for them to be long time relations with the Clintons is not a coincidence </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I got one for that (actually replied to something here awhile ago); put on your Tin Foil Hat:</p>

<p>So, when i worked on drill rigs, i was given this offsider called &quot;Mikey&quot;. Mikey originated from Odessa, Texas, and spent time in the USMC in Iraq, Afghanistan &amp; Pakistan before moving his family all the way here to Australia (their 2 toddlers, his parents &amp; brother, his wifes father, 2 sisters &amp; brother).</p>

<p>We were drinking one night after the rig had broken down, and i asked him way he moved here. His exact reply was-&quot;We weren&#39;t over there for any Dictator or Oil. We are over there for something else, and it fucks me what it is. I just knew i had to get the fuck out of the US&quot;. His elaboration of the question i asked was vague as fuck, and wasn&#39;t even a real reply to the question- it was a blanket answer.</p>

<p>Take that with a bag of salt, like i did.</p>

<p>But, everything that is happen world wide, makes no fucking sense man, none at all, and people are feeling this- in their gut, they <em>know</em>something is coming, but they just can&#39;t sense what it is, i don&#39;t either. </p>

<p>Someone asked me to do a nosleep thingy, but i can&#39;t do justice in words, the look on his face or even how he replied- even now, 8 years after i asked him (lost touch with him a few years ago now, no one i contacted knows what happened to him), it makes my mind race.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>But that&#39;s the thing, those DNA tests don&#39;t know where you live. Those tests track haplogroups, and so your family has the genes from someone that can be traced back to Western Europe. </p>

No. How does it feel to share the same belief and ideology as racists in your party? Is it uncomfortable? Is it weird? Do you just ignore it?do you denounce it? 
The media focuses on the shithead racists. Always right wing never left. MOST Republicans are average people like me that believe in equality and the things I first stated. I’m sorry if you’ve been led to believe otherwise but it’s just simply not true.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hey man, you&#39;re welcome to believe in those things. I was only asking a question. I&#39;m not going to criticize you for ideologically believing in the concept of smaller government, that&#39;s your prerogative.</p>

<p>That out of the way... right. I&#39;m sure you&#39;ve seen <em>thousands</em> of democrats on Twitter calling for the extinction of white people, which I can&#39;t even say with a straight face because of how utterly ridiculous the very notion is, while being a white male myself, and acknowledging how utterly silly it is for me to even give a shit while also understanding there is a lot of vitriol toward the white race in general for hundreds of years of atrocities (trail of tears, slavery, pillaging and colonization) while many of us also continue to look the other way on important things like kids being separated from their families at the border, because they&#39;re not white kids, and they&#39;re not American, so it&#39;s obviously not our problem.</p>

<p>I obviously think those people are ridiculous and insane while I also find them equally hilarious that they truly believe that - and yet, I am pretty certain there aren&#39;t <em>actually</em> that many people who <strong>genuinely</strong> believe that bullshit, and many here on Reddit like to make a mountain of a mole hill on this issue by pretending it&#39;s a far more prevalent belief than it actually is, considering most of the people I have ever seen actually talking about it unironically... were Republicans.</p>

<p>By the way, genuine life improvement pro-tip - you should seriously consider getting off Twitter. That site is seriously just all around cancer. I guarantee you&#39;ll feel 10x better every day if you do.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is Reddit I would expect a racist or two, not someone to feed the trolls and get political in the same breath when it’s not the right thread (true I shouldn’t have responded either) and just misinformed. When you paint everyone with the same brush that’s how we all stay ignorant of each other’s beliefs and they keep us divided. I believe in your right to say whatever you want except when you group me in as a racist just because I want less government/less regulations more than increased abortion rights.

<p>Anyway, good talk, I think? I&#39;ve started trying a new approach to debating the opposition on reddit - I firmly believe there is far too much vitriol on this site all around and honestly, I&#39;m really tired of it. It would be nice if we could eventually find a way to just <em>talk</em> to each other again without immediately resorting to calling each other libtards and nazis and devolving to ad hominem and personal attacks.</p>

<p>I encourage everyone to give it a try, because after years of engaging in it myself, I&#39;ve found there is nothing productive in the alternative.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you&#39;re wanting to count things like 20th cousins as being one bloodline, sure. It&#39;s just worth noting that after 20 generations, any individual would have millions of &quot;relatives&quot; when using such a loose association. It&#39;s also worth mentioning that they&#39;d have about as much genetic relation to someone 800 years ago as they would to a random stranger on the street. The further back you go, the easier it is to bridge family trees together.</p>

<p>While it is true you can trace 43 of 44 presidents to King John of England, aka John Lackland, the same can be said of almost any American who has anglo-saxon ancestry in the last 800 years or so.</p>

<p>For instance, it&#39;s estimated that 99.997% of anyone with anglo-saxon ancestry descends from King Edward III who ruled in the 14th century.<sup>1</sup> Edward himself traces back to King John as well.<sup>2</sup></p>

<p>Basically, it&#39;s not weird at all that 43 out of 44 presidents are &quot;related.&quot; What&#39;s weird is the one who isn&#39;t, Martin Van Buren. He had Dutch ancestry.<sup>3</sup></p>

<p>I don&#39;t necessarily think Pizzagate is real, but the reaction to it was definitely odd. There&#39;s news footage of an interview with the owner of the pizza place talking about their basement (pre-Pizzagate). Once Pizzagate started, all of a sudden &quot;we don&#39;t have and have never had a basement&quot;. Suspicious AF.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well thats a new theory to me.  Have you done any digging to back that up? A ton of time and effort has gone into researching PG and the evidence suggests something strange is going on.  If you know something I don&#39;t then please clue me in.</p>

<p>On the 2nd point, as far as I am aware the children are still in government custody and would be very difficult to traffic children under those circumstances due to the presence of a paper trail.  If and when those children get shunted off in to foster care, that&#39;s when these kids seem to go &quot;missing&quot;.  </p>

<p>I mean anything is possible, this is certainly proving true in the last 2 years.  </p>

<p>If you haven&#39;t done so this is worth checking out</p>

<p>There hasn&#39;t been a moon landing in hella years because </p>
</blockquote>

<p>There&#39;s one theory I developed to explain this one. </p>

<p>First, it&#39;s well accepted that the early space program was a test bed and a showcase for ballistic missile technology. So to explains the Moon landings and subsequent absence, I took the same line of reasoning and went one step further.</p>

<p>When you can put some guys in a Lunar module and fly them all the way around the Moon and land there at a location of your choice... you have convincingly demonstrated your ability to place a nuclear warhead (of whatever size) there as well.</p>

<p>The Moon landings were the US statement warning anyone else against ever thinking of using the Moon for their own military purposes. If someone wanted to try and use the Moon as a staging platform for missiles (like the Russians did with Cuba in 1962) the US could nuke it no problem.</p>

<p>No fallout and no news stories either.</p>

<p>My theory was we never stopped going to the moon. But the respondents in this thread have me almost convinced we never went at all.</p>

<p>There&#39;s just no other realm of science where we&#39;re advanced enough to do something and then, a half-century later, we&#39;re not.  We now putz around in low-earth orbit and that&#39;s all we can do. But when computers were the size of school buses we were sending no-technology cans to the moon, landing them, then taking off from the moon and catching an orbiting return flight, all PERFECTLY. Several times a year.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re forgetting the fiscal aspect of all of this. Manned space travel is expensive and requires a lot of effort and organization. It&#39;s not that we <em>can&#39;t</em> go back to the moon. We could do it, but the political will is weak and the private ventures don&#39;t make a profit just by sending some people there.  </p>

<p>We had Saturn V launch vehicles back then and so we could run big heavy missions. The original design is based around a manufacturing landscape which no longer exists. We could do it, but it would be prohibitively expensive. It is cheaper to start over with a fresh, modern design, which is sort of in progress now.  </p>

<p>If the political will and funding was there, we could do just about anything. It is really expensive though. We took a lot of risks back then that would be viewed as unacceptable in the current aerospace industry. The Apollo program was possible because we just threw money at the problem and got a working solution as quickly as possible. People weren&#39;t as concerned about the possibility of loss of life as they are now because that&#39;s just the nature of exploring a new frontier. In today&#39;s engineering culture of extensive risk analysis, it turns out to be <em>much</em> easier to do everything unmanned. For now, that has been sufficient, but we are slowly preparing for the eventual expansion into manned exploration.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That is not even in the same ballpark. Long term, there are massive profits to be made in space, mostly from industrial activity and mining, but also tourism. However, the startup costs are unimaginably high and the road is long and difficult and nobody has done it before. This makes the risk for investors even higher because people tend to make a lot of mistakes early on in the development of a brand new industry. Later on, people will learn from these mistakes and it will only get easier over time. But someone has to dive in and take on the risk before anything will really get going.  </p>

<p>I think you just don&#39;t realize how much goes into space flight engineering. Even with advanced computers and precision manufacturing, it is still a massive challenge. It will happen in due time.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Per RFK: </p>

<p>&quot;In Nemesis, Evans gives a totally different motive. He has unearthed startling evidence that the assassination was carried out by a Palestinian terrorist named Mahmoud Hamshari.</p>

<p>Evans quotes sources as saying that Hamshari was receiving protection money from Aristotle Onassis to prevent attacks on his Olympic Airlines. Onassis, says Evans, had hated Bobby Kennedy since 1953, when Kennedy was one of the prime movers in scuppering a major deal Onassis was pushing through in Saudi Arabia. In addition, Kennedy stood in the way of his marriage to Jackie. She had promised her brother-in-law not to wed Onassis until after the 1968 election because they both knew how the American public would have reacted. She married Onassis in October 1968.</p>

<p>Dr Bryan was chosen to hypnotise Sirhan because he had links to both Hamshari and Onassis. Hamshari had visited him seeking a cure for migraine headaches, while Onassis had called on the doctor in an attempt to cure his sexual dysfunction, says Evans. It was Onassis&#39;s money, says Evans, that financed both the hypnotism of Sirhan and the assassination.&quot;</p>

<p>The Christian/Abrahamic belief system seems so simple, enticing and all-pervasive in culture at large that I can&#39;t grasp the concept of how it would be under fire by a concerted _anti_(rather than merely &quot;skeptical&quot;) effort: especially by &quot;religious satanists&quot;.</p>

<p>Do the Satanists believe in Hell, or some kind of bastardized version were they would be rewarded for ill deeds in this life? Literally the majority of this entire planet is devil-hating religious worshipers: how do these people even remotely keep under the radar? What differentiates this wave of &quot;atrocious artist&quot; from the last hundred centuries of the same: is there not some artist you like today that would be called an agent of evil in the past?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Satanism is a broad term but some believe that Lucifer is the light bringer. He didn’t deceive Eve in the garden rather brought us knowledge and gave us the ability to become gods ourselves. That is 100% anti biblical. </p>

<p>Satan wants to be God. That’s why he was cast out of heaven along with his followers. He is deceiving the masses into thinking they can also become gods of this world (aka celebrities) and that it actually matters when in fact it doesn’t matter because in the end we all die. Would you rather spend eternity in heaven in paradise and live as a Christian on earth? Or would you rather be famous rich and love however you want on earth and spend eternity in hell?</p>

<p>This sounds like the ultimate non-option, really. Blame this on my lack of my imagination, please, but I can&#39;t even remotely see this as a divisive option for anyone _who actually believes in any kind of &quot;opposed-aligned cosmic pantheon&quot;; where there&#39;s two forces - one good, one evil - offering drastically opposed ends for the soul_. </p>

<p>Living as a christian is basically  &quot;apply the golden rule and accept the occasional hypocrisy&quot;. It&#39;s mild as all hell (in its current form) and  I&#39;m throwing a blank in imagining who they could possibly need to &quot;love whoever they want&quot; to actually want to spend eternity in Hell: because that is what we&#39;re talking about, since actual religious satanists would have to believe in Hell as an actual place. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I meant to say live* sorry </p>

<p>The greatest deception the devil has played is convincing everyone he doesn’t exist. Satanists don’t think that the Bible is real so why would the believe in hell? They think that they have transcended to god-hood and have been deceived that they will live that way post humorously as well. </p>

<p>Living as a Christian does involve the Golden rule but your forgetting the other commandment from Jesus </p>

<p>Matthew 22:35-40 </p>

<p>35 One of them, an expert in the law, tested him with this question: 36 “Teacher, which is the greatest commandment in the Law?”</p>

<p>37 Jesus replied: “‘Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind.’38 This is the first and greatest commandment. 39 And the second is like it: ‘Love your neighbor as yourself.’40 All the Law and the Prophets hang on these two commandments</p>

<p>Loving God as your Lord means you want to follow his other commands such as the 10 commandments for example. The biblical life is the way that God designed humans to live their life BUT because of Satan and his deception to Adam and Eve, sin was introduced into the world and we are all at fault. </p>

<p>But as earlier stated, Satanists view God as the bad guy. Which is why they push fame, fortune, partying, drugs, alcohol, sex, etc. in all main stream media like music and movies. When you open your eyes to the deception it is truly mind blowing how evil this world really is in all forms. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>So Satanism, in how the followers argue it, is completely and utterly without a supernatural component? </p>

<p>If they don&#39;t believe in Satan (&quot;The greatest deception the devil has played is convincing everyone he doesn’t exist.&quot;)  and they have no consideration for God whatsoever (rejecting “‘Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind. &quot;), what are they actually left with?</p>

<p>Please, clarify if I&#39;m wrestling strawmen and scarecrows here, but I&#39;m left with a group of people who simultaneously don&#39;t believe in the bad and don&#39;t believe in the good, and I&#39;m left wondering what possible goal a concerted multi-billion dollar hollywood conspiracy would even remotely be working towards...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That is what is flawed about satanism. They think that this life is all that matters. They want to be Gods of this world ( as I said celebrities for lack of better term). The Bible teaches that this life is not the end. To be honest I’m not super educated on satanic beliefs so I apologize that I don’t know much more than what I’ve already stated. </p>

<p>As for Hollywood,I believe that the top people know what Satan wants, and Satan rewards them with fame and fortune for pushing the anti-biblical message, hence giving them motivation. Being a multi billion dollar human is the godlikeness that the devil deceived Adam and Eve with and that is his “reward” of doing what he wants vs what God wants. Does that make any sense? Haha</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What makes you think the bible isn&#39;t a conspiracy to control the masses?</p>

<p>You sound young by the phrasing of your comment.  I don&#39;t doubt there&#39;s a cult of powerful elite in Hollywood, and that they are luciferians, but I also believe that christian mythology is just that, mythology.  They&#39;re not so much worried about pulling man from God as they are about profiting.</p>

<p>Think of it this way.  If those who serve god are of Service to Others, and Luciferians are of Service to Self, then those serving themselves would seek pleasure, profit, and sustenance, and those serving others would seek to serve others and help them even at their own peril.  Now look at the whole of Christianity, Judaism, and Islam (all 3 are middle eastern religions of the SAME god).  Can you honestly say that Christianity and the religions of Abraham are serving others?  Remember, Israel is a theocracy, and so are many other countries.  Are those countries Socialist?  No, they are not, even though Christ espoused what we consider today to be liberal, progressive, and socialist values.</p>

<p>I&#39;m sorry my friend, but whatever war on Christianity you think is going on based on your understanding of what Christianity is supposed to be was lost centuries ago.  They are all Luciferians that have the power now, especially the Dominionists.</p>

<p>Name me a publicly known person you think is the type of Christian that you believe in and I&#39;ll tell you why they are not.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>First off, those three religions listed do NOT serve the same God. The Bible teaches clearly that the only way to our father is believe that Jesus Christ as LORD (God the son) and that he died for all our sins and that he rose again according to the scriptures. </p>

<p>Muslims believe Jesus was not God in human form but merely a prophet like Mohammad which is 100% against the Bible. </p>

<p>Jews also believe that Jesus was not the messiah and hence that is why JEWs crucified Jesus. </p>

<p>You sound deceived in my eyes. What is the point of deceiving the masses for profit in this life? That is what Satan wants you strive for rather than striving for a relationship with Jesus Christ. </p>

<p>And a publicly known person is a weak argument. Any publicly known person I could mention is one of these celebrities controlled by the same Satanists I am referring to. Whether it be televangelists or actors, I believe that they (not all) are teaching anti biblical meaning on some level because they are being controlled. </p>

<p>The Bible is very clear on what it means to be a true Christian and what the purpose of a Christian life is.</p>

<p>Ephesians 6:12</p>

<p>12 For we do not wrestle against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this age, against spiritual hosts of wickedness in the heavenly places.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Pilate was the only Roman involved in the story of Jesus crucification.  If you truly think the Romans wanted to kill Jesus, then you are uneducated on the biblical text. It clearly states the Pharisees (Jewish leaders) brought Jesus to Pilate asking him to crucify him. Pilate literally says that he finds no reason to kill him and only allows the crucification to happen because he left it in the hands of the Pharisees.  </p>

<p>Romans had nothing to do with the death of Jesus. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That’s a good question. I would love to say that I don’t listen to music that advocates that type of lifestyle, but I find it hard to avoid artists such as Kanye West, Kendrick Lamar. My main interests are in Electronic music though. </p>

<p>I honestly know I shouldn’t listen to that kind of music, but I also feel as if I have the spiritual discernment to not let the  messages of living a self glorifying life effect me. </p>

<p>I try my absolute best to stay away from all “mumble rappers” because I think that they are the most blatantly satanically charged artists. </p>

<p>Movies/TV I honestly don’t watch a lot of just because I like to do other things with my free time. But, I also recognize the sinful message that almost every Hollywood movie/tv show that is produced and even though I can enjoy them, I don’t let the message of the movie effect how I live my life. I don’t see a movie about sleeping around and being drunk/partying all the time and think that I want to do that, for example. I see them more of just a story vs a real life example of what life should be like and that goes with any of the genres. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I once saw in a documental about the Incas the story of a priest who documented their arrival to an important city in Peru, there they met the chief of the city and was wearing a mask (just like in many other civilizations where their chief or priests, the ones higher in the pyramid scale are commonly wearing a mask). The thing is that few months later the catholic priest asked this chief why he was always wearing the ceremonial mask and he reply to him that if his people looked at him without the mask, they would be afraid of him. This make me think about the relation of ceremonial masks (always depicting animal forms) and why only the chiefs would wear them. You can trace this in the Egiptians, the Mayans, the Incas, etc... They might be the perfect disguise for an alien civilization to blend with humans.  </p>

<p>they&#39;re located across the street from my local pub, so I probably spend an inordinate amount of time just watching the restaurant through the windows as I sip my drink, but they&#39;re always empty and don&#39;t deliver...

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve heard lots of stories about predominantly Asian businesses (restaurants, nail salons, etc) being fronts for stuff, usually drugs, prostitution and human trafficking.</p>

<p>Nail salons and prostitution seems entirely believable -- they&#39;re almost ALWAYS young women and the salons are often open crazy hours where there are few customers.  Restaurants and drugs is believable too, either back to olden days of opium dens or simply because a take-out business offers camouflage for quick in/out traffic no one would challenge, but other than the Asian/Opium angle it could apply to any restaurant.</p>

<p>Where I live was a major resettlement location for Hmong and Vietnamese refugees in the 1970s and there were numerous opium busts in their community in that era, in fact I think a local woman got busted just a year or two ago trying to sneak in a large amount of morphine base after a trip home to Laos.  I&#39;ve also been at hard-core authentic Asian restaurants at odd hours --  when there are no adventurous liberals out having dinner, and the clientele is otherwise 100% Asian -- and it&#39;s totally obvious when the Asian gang guys come in.  So at least around here it makes the restaurant/crime angle seem believable, even if its merely coincidental.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think the genius is that the primary clientele for nail places is women.  While it sounds like an obstacle to prostitution, it doesn&#39;t mean that you can&#39;t have a back entrance, off-hours, or outcall services.  Plus a lot of these nail places are in strip malls or other multi-tenant builds where additional prostitution customer traffic would blend in.</p>

<p>So you have a business with all-female employees and mostly female customers, giving it a total air of legitimacy.  Add in a high-traffic location where your underground customers can come and go without drawing attention and it seems like a recipe for perfect cover.</p>

<p>How the &quot;massage parlor&quot; ever worked as cover, I don&#39;t know.  I mean now with yoga and all that kind of thing being so mainstream, you could probably get away with it, but back years ago it was totally obvious.  Growing up in the 1970s we had one about 4 blocks from my house at the intersection with the gas stations, barbershop and drugstore.  Everybody knew what &quot;The Bamboo Hut&quot; was about and when we were old enough to walk down to the drug store for candy (and pick up the carton of cigarettes mom called in), our parents told us &quot;stay away from the Bamboo Hut, its a bad place&quot;.</p>

<p>We have a local restaurant that&#39;s awfully similar, though it&#39;s more of a food truck-ish thing in an open area.  The food is reasonable, but whenever a new person walks in, they turn the music up uncomfortably loud.</p>

<p>I presume they&#39;re warning someone that people just came in, and to cut out whatever illegal they&#39;re up to, but we persisted and they don&#39;t turn it up when we stop by anymore.  :)</p>

The conspiracy I heard was that he found out that the charities he was supporting were fronts for money laundering and he was gonna go public with it. Reach Out Worldwide was his own foundation and they indeed helped in Haiti. No surprise that the Clinton Foundation would have had some hand in his death, considering their proven track record in Haiti, as well as their &quot;illustrious&quot; body count </p>

<p>All I know is that the Sam (Reedus the Fetus) has to deliver the dead away from whatever is absorbing their bodies. </p>

<p>I think the depth to it, no matter how maniacal, is what makes Kojima a great writer. He creates his own elaborate rabbit holes that, if you&#39;re interested enough, can dig into and spend hours deciphering the intricacies.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>We&#39;re all enslaved to a prime-spirit that seeks only to further its own selfish ends through a gathered mass of external agents. Our crimes, our wars, our suffering is only meant to further the sum-totality of &quot;The Human&quot;: its spread and influence and survival. </p>

<p>Avoiding the knee-jerk reaction and the instinctive urges puts us a step beyond status as puppets, but even then most of us act only within the fabric of the acceptable win-loss calculus allowed to further the prime spirit. </p>

<p>Only utter and abject rejection of the &quot;human&quot;-sensibility can set us free, but reaching that condition is so counter-intuitive that it practically becomes unreachable. </p>

<p>[TL:DR I believe in basically a more fantastical &quot;selfish gene theory&quot; with the caveat that we should combat it through moral living.]</p>

Your mouth just can&#39;t deny the month-to-month figures.  </p>

<p>But of course if you wanna believe in a trigger theory, you&#39;d then have to admit it operated in dimension of warped time-space, i.e. in your jelly brain, not in reality.  Let&#39;s reminisce...</p>

<p>Super bowl was on feb.1, but 3 days previously, Jan 28, David Kay head of Iraq Survey Group says &quot;we were almost all wrong&quot;.  So there&#39;s that.
...
Feb. 2, I hear crickets... but tell me if ur hearing something diff.
...
Then Feb.5 Powell tells fat lie to UN that they failed to disarm.
...
CIA director Tenet resigns June 3 for &quot;personal&quot; reasons, never once budging from his &quot;slam dunk&quot; assertion that Iraq haddem.<br/>
Next day Pavitt also resigned, satan calling?
...
Meanwhile the official ISG report admitting there were never WMDs came Sept.30, 9mos later.  bam!
...
Janet must have some tasty cookies for the fetus of truth to break the placenta barrier on schedule.  How to explain time warp? well.... nipples do tend to do this to mind of men born in the usa, mass sexual repression works market wonders.</p>

<p>But back to the subject at hand... what&#39;s so &quot;unusual&quot; about nips?  aaand seriously, what&#39;s up w flooding this dumb post with &quot;mattress&quot; fluff and now 900 replies about &quot;chinese take-out&quot;?  This is like 3rd grade l unusual, wow you guys on this subs got played like chopsticks today.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Malasia Airlines MH370 that disappeared on March 8, 2014.</p>

<p>I read an article within days of its disappearance that all of the Ukraine gold treasury was being shipped to the US to keep it safe from Russia and it never arrived. There&#39;s a theory it was loaded onto a passenger jet. 5 trucks worth! I can&#39;t remember the weight but it was significant. How easy would it have been to hijack the aircraft, land it in some remote place, kill everyone, take the gold and say it crashed into the ocean? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Pink Floyd (likely Roger Waters) drove Syd Barrett crazy so that they could get away from his wacky songwriting and become more popular, with the bonus of being able to big up the insanity of there ex band mate for more fame. I think David Gilmour feels guilty about this or even repressed the memory but I think Roger is fully aware of it. Syd then went to live a life of isolation because of a mix of drugs, what I think is autism, and the fact all his friends turned on him broke his faith in humanity entirely. Maybe Roger even gaslighted him into believing he was going insane. We never heard Syds side of the story, maybe he was too scared to speak out? Scared of the potential backlash? Poor guy. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Man that is far fetched. Piper at the gates of dawn was really darn popular and Floyd didn&#39;t break out again until dsotm. Syd was well loved by all the band, and you can hear this both on his solo albums and in shine on you crazy diamond. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I dunno, you could be right don&#39;t get me wrong. And Dave seems to really love the guy plus with his help on the solo albums. But Roger seems like a narcissist to me, and he seems like he bigs Syd up for some kind of cult of personality. It adds to the mystique of the Floyd. I thnk Syd just got tired of fame and being &quot;fake&quot; for top of the pops. I don&#39;t think insanity happened, if anything, the situations where he played 1 note through a gig seems like autistic stubbornness. (I have autism and can fully relate). I see this stubbornness as a reaction to something and arguments with Roger in the band could be something. The way he speaks about the &quot;have you got it yet&quot; incident, and says that&#39;s the last time they spoke for a while. I think there was more of an argument there than him just walking away with the &quot;I&#39;ve got it&quot; quip. It all just seems too much like a fairy tail or scripted story. I just wish we could have heard Syds side of the story a few decades later. I wonder what he&#39;d have said about this period in his life.</p>

<p>I might be wrong, my theory basically hinges on the fact that some knowledge died with Syd I&#39;ll never find out. But there are just too many things that add up. Vegetable mans lyrics give me the chills. He seems to hate himself in that song and thinks there isn&#39;t aplace for himself in the world. Could the band have given him this idea who knows. </p>

<p>Whhatever is true, the guy was a legend and so was pink floyd in general :P I don&#39;t think it was all planned in advanced i think it was more Roger capitalizing on many specific situations and manipulating  things. He&#39;s smart enough and imo cynical enough </p>

<p>By the early 1960s the British presence in the American popular imagination  had dwindled to being negligible and Britain&#39;s political/social elite were trying to stop the slide into becoming an irrelevant post-colonial backwater.</p>

<p>The same strategy was used again in the mid 1990s. The rise of US hip-hop culture had totally frozen out new British acts, so the British government held entertainment industry think-tanks to try to rectify it.</p>

Maybe the term chem trail isn’t the term I should have used. They are manipulating the weather through technology like HAARP. They are messing with earths electric magnetic fields and it’s messing up our weather patterns in alarming ways. 
If you look at videos of the sky before a major even happens you always see some kind of weird lighting in the atmosphere minutes or hours before devastating events.

Keep in mind that Dia is a massive chunk of land but when you get down there it&#39;s just endless. offices after offices large cavernous space after large cavernous space. There is an apparently abandoned old baggage system which if I recall never seemed to work right anyways. And I had several friends that were involved in various aspects of the construction which was heavily plagued by disasters deaths and apparent secrecy. But it was obvious that the much of the entire area had been completely abandoned shortly after being built and had hundreds of thousands if not millions of square feet of rooms corridors Etc that had never seen much more use than the occasional flight attendant getting freaky or baggage handler eating his lunch. It&#39;s a very dark and foreboding place.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Fascism is the antithises of democracy and the principles of the constitution of the United States and declaration of independence. Fascism is anti freedom and forces people to align with the positions of the state, or else. Fascism is intellectually dishonest and is only able to be justified by cherry picking information. Fascism is rule by government power and approved businesses. And to think we just got done destroying a country (iraq) in the name of bringing democracy to it and overthrowing it&#39;s racist leader, (Sadam) only to have a fascist uprising in the United States a decade later.

    <div class="md"><p>No. Fascistic would be complete control of the media refusing any outlet to say anything negative about him. As it stands, almost all mainstream outlets constantly shit all over him as much as they can.  Sometimes pushing important news into the background to highlight some stupid thing he did. All msm is literally corporate propaganda in the first place. Their job is to manipulate you and  force feed you a view of events that benefits the corporations that run them. They have absolutely no obligation to be objective and have been caught time and time again running staged events or misrepresenting the truth. Whether right wing or left wing media, their aim is not to inform you, it is to manufacture consent or rage.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I see the truth in what you are saying. But that doesn&#39;t make his inability to take criticism from the media or individuals any less true or dangerous. Where does FOX news fall on this spectrum? What about brietbary and info wars? Be sure according to Trump they are much more credible then the mainstream media. Again, I have said this to everyone on this thread so far, read about fascism before pretending to know what it is! 
It isn&#39;t binary. But can be identified by bundles of characteristics. One being treatment of media: .</p>

<p>In regards to fascism...
 Controlled Mass Media - Sometimes media is directly controlled by the government, but in other cases, the media is indirectly controlled by government regulation, or sympathetic media spokespeople and executives. Censorship, especially in war time, is very common</p>

<p>Fascists believe that liberal democracy is obsolete and they regard the complete mobilization of society under a totalitarian one-party state as necessary to prepare a nation for armed conflict and to respond effectively to economic difficulties.[12] Such a state is led by a strong leader—such as a dictator and a martial government composed of the members of the governing fascist party—to forge national unity and maintain a stable and orderly society.[12] Fascism rejects assertions that violence is automatically negative in nature and views political violence, war and imperialism as means that can achieve national rejuvenation.[13][14][15][16] Fascists advocate a mixed economy, with the principal goal of achieving autarkythrough protectionist and interventionist economic policies.[17]</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I believe he is not part of bigger &quot;cabals&quot;, that&#39;s for sure, he surely did not come to presendency through the usual means. Because he spreads conspiracy theories and in doing so spurs thinking in the population about corruption, unlike any other bland passive politicians the US have ever done. However, he&#39;s still selfish, and I don&#39;t think he&#39;s &quot;fighting the good fight&quot;. At best he&#39;s just a vain celebrity who wants admiration. You can&#39;t pretend he&#39;s not a bit of slimy human being who does things for himself mostly. I like the rebellious attitude that he has, but I don&#39;t think he&#39;s immune to making a deal with the devil, because he doesn&#39;t have other people&#39;s best interest at heart, he just uses that to get the admiration of people because that&#39;s been his life. His actions are so blatantly selfish that his followers don&#39;t believe they are genuinely for himself because there&#39;s no way he can disregard those actions so easily. But people have always been dismissive and forgiving of his behaviour his whole life because it&#39;s part of his character his celebrity status and we have heard him admit this, so there&#39;s no wonder he thinks he can get away with it all. I also think he&#39;s a bit niave and let&#39;s people (like Putin) take advantage of him, so there&#39;s that also.</p>

<p>Q is so overwhelmingly pro Trump and neocon is his stuff that at worst he’s a LARP. At best, he’s a psyop to keep people oblivious to the disappearing immigrant children, the continuing war economy, and the sell out to foreign and corporate interests that is taking place under the Trump admin. Keep a healthy skepticism. Anyone who promotes someone as a saint like Q does to Trump has an agenda. </p>

<p>I think it goes beyond mere ignorance and irrationality (though those are certainly factors). Obviously there are people who make money from the violence continuing, that much isn&#39;t hidden at all. But I wonder if there are other less obvious forces at work as well.</p>

<p>Again, probably not considered that unusual of a thought in this sub, but it&#39;s certainly strange that so few people seem to question the sexual violence that takes place every single day in a land that supposedly values freedom.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The producers of <em>La La Land</em> were called up as the winners of the Best Picture Academy Award at last year&#39;s Oscars presentation because after the #OscarsSoWhite social media campaign the prior year it would be tough to explain to the general public why the award for <em>Moonlight</em>, a predominantly black film adapted for the screen and directed by a black filmmaker, was being accepted by three white people.</p>

<p>It&#39;s easy to sneak three white people on and off stage when there are twenty more already up there. Add Barry Jenkins, the director (who did not win the award - the producers win Best Picture), giving the acceptance speech and you&#39;ve just shut a whole bunch of people.</p>

<p>To make you and your existence meaningless. You&#39;re just a piece of shit on a spinning rock. Now go to work. Buy shit. Pay your taxes. Shut the fuck up</p>

And a couple years later I was dating a gypsy who was half Romani half native American and I told her about my past experience and asked her what it was. She literally pulled me out of my body and explained to me what it is and then we went to my childhood fort I built in the mountains. Later she taught me how to do it.</p>

<p>It starts with the combined effort of the iranian Ayatollah and Reagan to withhold the release of the hostages goes on to the Iraq-Iranian war where Iran reacted with the introduction of suicide attacks to the US-weaponery equipped Iraq (the second an third gulf war where fought to conceal this) a concept which was later perfected by the Hezbollah and the Tamil Tigers.</p>

<p>well to lazy to go on but the premise is basically this: In an ideal free world progress would go on in the direction of personal and societal liberties as well as free movement and a combined effort to save as many human beings as possible. How come that the last 20 years brought up so much groups worldwide which oppose this vision? And how come that those group *endorse* each other? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not sure if I&#39;ve ever seen this proposed but here goes....that the elusive dark matter that scientists are so keen to identify is actually a cloud of probability. </p>

<p>The same as we observe in quantum mechanics. Where they say that an electron can be in various positions and is only confirmed by observing it. They seem to be so confused that they think that observations on the quantum scale are different from the macro scale....when really it is a the ancients taught &quot;as above, so below&quot;.</p>

<p>This would suppose also that everything exists in a soup that is actually consciousness. Humans are actually the flesh and blood embodiment of that principle. We are the truest manifestation of that since we can interact with and contemplate our place in it.</p>

<p>The reason why the transhumanist movement will never come to fruition is that scientists may be able to model the physicality of what they see in the brain but what drives it will never be understood. I liken it to throwing a rock in the water and studying the ripples if you didn&#39;t know what water was. You can study the shape of said ripple but can never determine the medium that is composing it or the reason for the ripple.</p>

<p>This theory also reconciles all of the physic, seemingly otherworldly(ghost), astral travel, akashic records phenomena. If it already exists then it is just a matter of tuning into it. By tuning into it you actually observe it therefore bringing definition to probability.</p>

<p>Just stuff that has been rattling around in my head...</p>

He was suspended by the NBA for excessive and gross gambling violations with his father that caused the NBA to do <em>something.</em> The league already had a shitty reputation and its star player pushed that to the limits that TV and sponsors would bear.</p>

<p>So how do we solve this problem. MJ had a personal service contract with the owner of the Bulls. Which means MJ gets paid whether he works or not. The owner of the Bulls also owns a minor league baseball franchise. <em>Voila!</em> MJ plays AA ball for a while under his personal service contract until his suspension runs out, and returns to the NBA.</p>

His music took a major tone shift and so did his appearance, and he has never been the same since around that time. Listen to his album Marshall Mathers LP 2 and then listen to his album Encore, his flow has changed, his voice, his lyrics and all. Compare photographs of him from 2007 and before with recent ones. The story goes he died the night he went to a hospital for an overdose but that his label replsced him with someone who would continue making money for them and his family.</p>

I haven&#39;t finished the video but I stopped it at 3 mins because i got weirded out. Elon seems so unhuman when speaking and seems very different. If he has a speech or social disorder then nevermind but if not then i believe something funky is going on. I&#39;m also stoned so this could make no sense.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Popular books/shows/games/movies about &quot;collapse&quot; types of events - zombies, viral outbreak, nuclear holocaust, etc - are meant to teach the general population skills and knowledge they can use to survive.</p>

<p>From these forms of media, you can understand how viruses spread and how to quarantine the sick until they are no longer a risk. You can learn basic survival skills. Basic notions like &quot;always stick together&quot; or &quot;never give up your weapons&quot; are passed along.</p>

<p>We&#39;re being prepared for the collapse. Most of us will die. But some of us won&#39;t, perhaps because we paid attention.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That the &quot;spiritual realm&quot;(Which anyone can experience, but not yet measure) has bled into our world. There&#39;s no aliens, or at least evidence at all for any after decades of researchers looking for any clue. The forces from the ancient world and the forces alluded to now through occultist practices and secret society imagery are the beings referred to as the &quot;fallen angels&quot;, and through a trickle down hierarchy, they lead the population towards &quot;anti-Christ&quot;. So much about the technology we are getting to reach the precipice of will usher in a new system that will forever render humanity obsolete, as well as bring this hidden world to light. Earth life as we know it will soon reach a climax and ending. As it is now, these forces of darkness are doing the most fucked up stuff right beneath our noses.</p>

<p>I&#39;m so convinced that the elite are completely aware, and have been since the earliest dawn of civilization. This has been going on since before the Ice Age ended. There is no true force opposing the system, everything that tries will get subverted and everything that claims to be doing so is a lie.</p>

<p>I started as a skeptical atheist and now after slap after slap after slap of this reality, I am starting to truly believe. And there&#39;s so much more to it. I implore you to research and find the connections. There was a time where I didn&#39;t see much and concluded that there was merely an ancestor mythology that got out of control...It isn&#39;t and it wasn&#39;t..That&#39;s all I can say..</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That my high-school was a visa factory. It was in the middle of the Midwest US and the majority of the teachers were Turkish and didn&#39;t even speak very good English which honestly made learning really difficult in a lot of classes. It was so bad in one of my classes that we ended up swapping math teachers every other day so we could learn something, and then the days we had the Turkish teacher we just basically had a study hall. There was also a pattern where the new male teachers would get promoted really fast if they got married and the female teachers would end up married and pregnant and then &quot;take a year off&quot; for maternity leave and never be heard from again. Definitely seemed like they only kept jobs as long as it took to solidify something longer here, like getting married or having better job security. And the worst part of it all was that it was a charter school and the state law had very loose requirements for charter school teachers. </p>

<p>March 6th, 2009 at 6:04 PM right here
 <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/tZ2HNNYVoPF2">https://goo.gl/maps/tZ2HNNYVoPF2</a></p>

<p>Basically I was driving with my girlfriend at the time (now wife) and I looked out in the field and saw a blueish white light hit the ground. Just like out of the movies, I still can&#39;t believe it happened that stereotypically but it did. Anyway I&#39;m yelling something like &quot;WTF was that, WTF was that&quot; and my wife is freaking out because I&#39;m driving and freaking out.</p>

<p>Well anyway we drive up the road about a 1/5th a mile and turn and then we see it. </p>

<p>It was some sort of craft in the sky and it clearly was trying to be invisible but it wasn&#39;t invisible as it made a bit of a blur in the sky. It moved slowly and low(maybe 500 feet max). </p>

<p>It was clearly in the shape of a triangle with 3 points that were more blurry than the rest of it. The whole thing was silent.</p>

<p>It sort of looked something like as if it was a water drop on the window but in the sky and three points that were that blurry while the rest was just slightly blury.</p>

<p>Anyway we watched it for about 10 seconds and then it took off. Basically instantly gone. </p>

<p>Fucking insane shit. Still don&#39;t know what the fuck it was as I&#39;m a very down to earth person in terms of logic and shit. I don&#39;t know what the fuck it was but i know it&#39;s something we don&#39;t know about.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Before that my life was much simpler. It fucking changed me.</p>

<p>And I&#39;m not crazy at all. I later became an incident investigator for a government agency. I&#39;m about as objective as it gets when it comes to facts and to this day I get anxiety trying to figure out what I saw.</p>

<p>The light was like straight out a movie tractor beam like. It fucking blows my mind that it was so stereotypical. I thought Hollywood made that shit up.</p>

<p>The craft was triangular and clearly there moving but it clearly was attempting to be disguised as if the entire surface was a LED screen showing the image around it ( I actually think we could easily do that with current technology)</p>

<p>But where I&#39;m confused is a silent craft that took off like that. I&#39;m not aware of any current technology that allows that. But then again there&#39;s always that 50 year advancement theory that people say the military has technology wise. But either way if it was man made it certainly isn&#39;t something that the public knows about.</p>

<p>Either way, it is one of the most profound moments of my life and will be something that sticks with me forever. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Alright, if you ever go to downtown Hollywood( By the Chinese theatre), while I was in college I worked at the Gucci store down there( sucks).</p>

<p>It’s where you walk in, and into the area where you can go to gift shops etc...</p>

<p>There is a store where they sell “ gold flakes lotion” or “‘moisturizer ”... They used to have this rotund, half gay, mexican dude, or a hot girl( middle eastern), just giving out free samples.</p>

<p>They’re always giving out free samples, I worked at the Gucci store for 8 months, never saw anyone buy a damn thing there.. not once, got a sample and the lotion was oily, and smelt nauseating...</p>

<p>The store was own by Jewish people( a group, Israel), and we all assumed it was a money laundering venture, completely... I know it  was.</p>

<p>But that’s common for So-Cal, anyone with money is laundering drug money.. What do you think all those taco shops, or food trucks are doing?</p>

<p>This is common practice out here. Fuck, I’d get involved, but I’m too unique looking, to known, and stick out like a sore thumb, so I have to be an “ honest injun”, it sucks, but I tell my friends to not get caught up, since, the feds are watching.. They always are.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The north pole is called that due to the magnetic pole but it would not matter if it was over michigan as it would still be the north pole. The magnetic pole does not have to be where it is cold nor does it necessarily make it cold by shifting.

<p>It’s because my friend worked in the market and he always talked about all this shady stuff going on with the owner and how he was weird and whatnot </p>

<p>And I happened to work in the pizza shop for about a month and there was tons of weird shit going on. </p>

<p>Like the owner would never be there, or would get a call and leave and not come back for super long, but all the calls would be calls to the store. </p>

<p>And there’s this one Wall Street guy that always came in to get pizza and after I quit I would always see the Wall Street dudes Mercedes G wagon parked in the back. Like literally always, always there late at night. </p>

<p>Eventually the market shut down and the owner of the pizza place just disappeared, after he was gone, the G wagon was never parked there anymore. </p>

<p>Here’s what me and my friends “know” </p>

<p>1.the pizza place and the market were working together somehow
2.The owner of the pizza place was definitely selling coke(this was actually confirmed)</p>

<p>What we don’t know:</p>

<p>We could never figure out if the Wall Street G wagon baller was selling coke to the pizza guy or pizza dude was selling to G wagon</p>

<p>It should be no surprise that Prescott Bush who made <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2004/sep/25/usa.secondworldwar">a killing equipping Nazi Germany for the war</a>, had a son who became a CIA officer who helped kill JFK, sold chemical weapon designs to Saddam Hussein.  Becomes president to kick off some wars. Then, yet again, his son went on to kick of yet more wars.
It&#39;s almost like they&#39;re not the nicest family.</p>

<p>Wall Street helped arm the Soviet Union too. It&#39;s no surprise that Stalin, JFK and Oloof Plame were assassinated for realising how bad secret societies were for maintaining peace. Coup d&#39;etat in slow motion indeed.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That a ton of scientific and mathematical knowledge was suppressed by both major religions which is known but also by many governments to use.</p>

<p>This is backed by many of my colleagues (I&#39;m a mathematician) and that much of the mathematics we have gotten in thrast 400~ years is calculus and beyond, should&#39;ve been easy to understand and create 1000+ years back.<br/>
Also there is evidence that advanced mathematics was practiced in India for a long time, as there have been found many, many math things that would&#39;ve taken calculus to make and understand ie trigonometry and Taylor series for them (infinite polynomials). 
Which isn&#39;t very hard to get with some 1st year calculus but practically impossible with just basic understanding of trigonometry.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Perhaps I should&#39;ve included a backstory.</p>

<p>People are constantly seeing points of lights...the size of a star....zipping through the skies.
Scientists (or debunkers) have always said what they&#39;re seeing is a satellite orbiting Earth.</p>

<p>To which I say, bonkers. There&#39;s no way we&#39;re seeing tiny satellites (with light coming to us here on the ground....like you stated) because it&#39;s impossible to see that far.</p>

<p>What we&#39;re seeing are self illuminating objects that are MUCH closer. 
Are they......
Secret military crafts? Probably. 
Extraterrestrial crafts? Possibly.
Satellites? No way!!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There are so many details that I don’t want to spend the time writing out, but I believe Time Warner Cable and Verizon are partnering to get data overage fees. Before I had an unlimited data plan, my router would drop the Internet connection when I started downloading apps or watching videos (aka large demands of data) and all of that downloading would suck from my Verizon data plan unless I shut off cellular data on my phone. Internet would go out for a full minute and then return. However, when I turned off cellular data before I did the same process, my Internet would not drop. This went on for a full year. The second I switched my phone plan to unlimited, my Internet did not drop even once. Nothing has changed in my internet setup. Again, I tested so many scenarios and it is very ironic that all of my problems stopped as soon as I went unlimited data on my cell phone plan.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Venture capitals in Silicon Valley are pure money launder. There is absolutely no way their &quot;business model&quot; is in any way sustainable. Most money they spent is completely wasted and an occasional successful exit will never cover all the mountains of money they flushed down the drain.

And since then I’ve seen a variety of methods including news items, new paper, google searches, you tube promoting the ridiculous channels and changes, movie and x files episode. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>dude the government(fbi, private security contractors also) dresses up like hippies and runs elaborate surveillance operations on music festivals, including distrubuting drugs and entrapment schemes custom designed from your social media and lifetime communications history.  </p>

<p>They sell you fake lsd that is actually a truth serum and then if you&#39;re a guy for instance, when you go to the porta potty they will put someone in your way to see if you will attack them.  </p>

<p>They use bait children.  Actually toddlers even, or they have some kind of android children.  Either way for me is a conspiracy so wild I would not believe it if I had not seen it multiple times.  </p>

<p>At steemit I write about this and also several other major conspiracies including: </p>

<p>Israel processes all billing and telephone communications meta data at the time of the phone call and at the time of purchase.  Israel could shut down the american economy with the push of a button and blame it on whoever they wanted.  </p>

<p>I have worked closely with a telecom engineer who swore that when he was trained to work for verizon he learned the system that stores every single phone call for the NSA and that they have every call since 1964, pretty much the day after kennedy was shot.</p>

<p>And as a result of my work here on reddit, someone delivered a pizza to my door.  And no one claimed credit and said it was a prank.  </p>

<p>Adrian Lamo&#39;s death, no cause.  Any of us could get a simple contact chemical on the doorknob and just turn up dead with no explanation at all.    </p>

Its not something that can be run by the few elite, or a coalition of multinational companies or other such things... However as unusual and logistically challenged as it sounds, I still believe it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>There&#39;s this guy who told me he was 38 and started talking to me about conspiracy theories at random about 2 months ago. I was out for a walk and he approached me which isn&#39;t unusual where I love. He was talking about real entry level conspiracy theory stuff. Then I decided to out conspiracy theory him and talked to him about archons and the demiurge and stuff like that. I saw him about a month ago and he yelled at me across the street that he was cracking the code. </p>

<p>Then he came up to me last week and told me how he was god and he was angry with the way the world was working and was going to destroy it. </p>

<p>my conspiracy theory is that I made that man crazy by having him dive too deep too fast into conspiracies.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I believe that shadow/ethereal people exist. The reason for this is that I saw a shadow person in my bedroom when I was like 5 years old. I was so scared that I froze and couldn&#39;t move, just stared at a dark figure. I hid behind the sofa and pissed my pants because I was too afraid to go to the bathroom. Never seen anything like it since. Maybe I imagined it, but the weird thing is that I remember seeing something, I am 100% sure that I did. But I can&#39;t seem to imagine how the thing that I saw specifically looked, like that mental image was erased from my head on some MiB shit.</p>

<p>Charles Manson wrote two Beach Boy hits.  People think this is an urban legend, but it&#39;s a fact.</p>

<p>Dennis Wilson was probably at the scene of the Tate murders.  This is the wilder bit of conspiracy, but probably the reason 2 films are being developed suddenly, one helmed by Tarantino.  There is also a TV show suddenly in production.</p>

<p>&#39;Something&#39; is about to get released regarding Manson, and it&#39;s probably related to the Beach Boys and the Tate murders.</p>

Craig had begun by selling mattresses over the internet.  But customers kept wanting to try out the mattresses before buying.  So he set up his appointment only showroom in an office building near Penn Station on the 6th floor.</p>

<p>Also, not everyone has a car, or a big enough car to pick up a mattress, and mist people want someone to take their old mattress away. Most places that sell matresses will do that for you.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That is not even in the same ballpark. Long term, there are massive profits to be made in space, mostly from industrial activity and mining, but also tourism. However, the startup costs are unimaginably high and the road is long and difficult and nobody has done it before. This makes the risk for investors even higher because people tend to make a lot of mistakes early on in the development of a brand new industry. Later on, people will learn from these mistakes and it will only get easier over time. But someone has to dive in and take on the risk before anything will really get going.  </p>
