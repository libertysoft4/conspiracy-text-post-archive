        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>So in <a href="https://yournewswire.com/clinton-campaign-official-arrested-child-rape/">this recent article</a> about the a charges against Joel Davis, the 22-year old Ivy League student who was trying to arrange the rapes of an 8 and a 9 year old child with undercover FBI agents. In the headline of the article from YourNewsWire, they state </p>

<blockquote>
<p>FBI: <strong>Clinton Campaign Official</strong> Arrested On Child Rape Charges</p>
</blockquote>

<p>They&#39;re only evidence for that claim being <a href="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/27/16/4DB0E23900000578-5890179-image-m-17_1530112828051.jpg">this</a> photograph, and nothing else.</p>

<p>Every other article correctly does not label him as a Clinton campagin official, <em>except</em> YourNewsWire.</p>

<p>Why?</p>

<p>I predict that in less than a couple hours, our good friends over at Snopes will write up a &quot;Fact Check&quot;, citing YourNewsWire and their claims that he is a Clinton campaign official, just so that they can put a big red &quot;FALSE&quot; at the top of the page. This will then be pushed to the very top of Google as the top hit for anyone that searches for &quot;Joel Davis&quot;.</p>

<p>Also interesting to note, I noticed that here in r/conspiracy, we linked to Daily Mail article (which does mention Clinton, but only to provide the picture and suggest that he may have helped campaign since he was there on election night). But over at T_D, they linked to the YourNewsWire article and are perpetuating the &quot;Campaign official&quot; narrative. Just figured I&#39;d mention it, since I know a lot of people claim that their sub is allegedly compromised.</p>

<p>I&#39;ll update this post if my prediction comes true. Just want this to be posted publicly if it does.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think that like with any effective controlled opposition, you first need to provide some <em>actually</em> useful/accurate stories or conspiracies, in order to first gain some kind of credibility. I can remember a time when they weren&#39;t as batshit as they are today.</p>

<p>At the same time, by posting a story to YNW, you can then immediately discredit that story anywhere else it may pop up, by claiming that the origin of the story is a site known for producing bull shit.</p>

<p>Serves two purposes. Glad people have started to realize this. I&#39;m not against people posting links to YNW here, just so long as everyone is EXTREMELY skeptical and verifies any and all claims made in an article before believing any of it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ok, let&#39;s clear this up.</p>

<p>The attempted connections to Trump and Epstein are incredibly forced. First of all, he&#39;s not on the flight manifest for the Lolita Express (unlike Clinton who is on there <strong>26 times</strong>). The only reference to Trump flying with Epstein I believe comes from one comment made by Epstein&#39;s brother in a court proceeding. And the fact that they were flying to a public event means it was probably on one of Epstein&#39;s other planes that was used for legitimate business purposes. <strong>There is absolutely zero evidence that Trump ever flew on the Lolita Express</strong>.</p>

<p>The other connections to Trump is that he once called him a &quot;terrific guy&quot; publicly (doesn&#39;t make them BFFs). Hell, in that quote he even CALLED EPSTEIN OUT for liking girls &quot;on the younger side&quot;! If he was a pedophile, wouldn&#39;t that be something he&#39;d probably <em>avoid</em> mentioning??</p>

<p>I&#39;m so sick of seeing this blatant false equivalency pushed all over reddit/the internet. If I&#39;m wrong, and anyone has evidence to the contrary, then please share with me. Because as of right now, I can&#39;t even believe there are people out there that still actually believe they are on the same level of creepy.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not saying Trump is 100% not a pedo... he very well could be. But what I am saying is that trying to use the Epstein connection to imply so is incredibly disingenuous and misleading.</p>

<p>Trump &quot;allegedly&quot; banned him from the club in 1999. If he banned him in 1999, why do we have pictures of Epstein in 2000 at Mar-A-Lago with Trump?</p>

<p>This is absolutely not true. The date on the image is the date the photo was shot and not added to gettyimages.com. Unless you believe gettyimages.com existed in 1956 and added this photo of Elvis on their website in 1956:</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Lol touche, that&#39;s a good point.</p>

<p>Do you know where it says anywhere that Trump banned Epstein in 1999? Because I can&#39;t find a reference for that source either, trying to confirm it from the other side.</p>

<p>I actually can&#39;t find a date or year for his banning anywhere, 1999 or otherwise.</p>

<p>Regardless though, this is still argument still seems like a huge reach. If Trump were involved, WHY IN THE WORLD would he say things like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRzII-qcyk&amp;amp;feature=share">this (0:06)</a> in public?????</p>

<p>It&#39;s in the video you linked below. Just to point out. Trump never said that he banned Epstein. The only source for that claim is the book &quot;Filthy Rich&quot; from Jeffrey Patterson, where he claims that Trump banned Epstein from Mar-A-Lago in 1999. That&#39;s it.</p>

<p>The stirring shit up part I have a hard time buying though. Stirring shit up by risking going to jail? Wouldn&#39;t they rat him out immediately? Mutually assured destruction kind of thing?</p>

<p>Probably. Do you really think that it&#39;s only a coincidence that Epstein had 10 different telephone numbers of Trump in his little black book?</p>

<p>Trump has been a big real estate magnate, especially in NYC for decades. It really doesn’t shock me that a powerful person like Epstein would have his number.</p>

<p>That being said, 10 different numbers does seem a little much. But I’d need more info to draw any conclusions from that. Like does he have that many numbers for a lot of people, or only a “select few”? </p>

<p>Because he also said his crowd size was the largest, made a fake Time magazine with him on it, Trump steaks (bad), Trump vodka (bad), said he couldn’t release his tax returns because he was audited (audit doesn’t matter), said he’d release his tax returns if he won (he didn’t), etc…</p>

    <div class="md"><p>FBI agent John D&#39;Souza said that the tack the intelligence agencies is taking has changed. In the past, they tried to suppress information. Now (due to the internet) they realize that they can&#39;t suppress it. So their new strategy is to flood the news cycle with so much fake news that the truth gets lost in the noise.</p>

<p>I mean, this stuff goes back to the CIA&#39;s Operation Mockingbird, where they infiltrated the media. (The Church Commission in the 1970s outed all the front companies that the CIA owned that ran magazines, newspapers, TV affiliates, etc. One of the most famous is a CIA shell company called &quot;Capital Cities&quot;. The CEO of Capital Cities was William Casey, who then went on to head the CIA. Capital Cities bought Disney, which owns networks like ABC (and ABC News).)</p>

<p>The new tack (as traditional legacy media is losing its influence) is to target prominent bloggers for bribery. Freedom of Information Act documents recently demonstrated that the intelligence agencies are making lists of the most popular Youtubers and internet personalities. Money that traditionally flowed to TV and magazines is now being channeled to bribe online personalities (and venues like Reddit).</p>

<p>I myself noticed a sea change in this subreddit, for example, after the 2016 election.</p>

<p>Although I will say, I wouldn&#39;t be too harsh on the mods here for what has happened. Maybe 1 or 2, but the real problem is with the Reddit Admins. They are the ones allowing this sub to be gamed, even though the mods have been screaming about it for a while. Plus their transparency is far greater than that of most other subs.</p>

<p>Been here a long time, and can honestly say that I appreciate the work the mods here put in, and the shit they have to deal with. Even though I disagree with bunch of them politically, I think they are pretty fair overall. The main people I see complaining about them are the ones that also happen to come here and not believe in any conspiracies whatsoever <em>oddly enough</em>.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Reddit, as an organization, is getting dark money from the Shadow Government.</p>

<p>Just as mass-media has been receiving for decades. </p>

<p>They&#39;re paid to give the appearance of a grassroots, open forum; while, in reality, they&#39;re literally PAID to promote certain talking-points and narratives.</p>

<p>Once mass media institutions cease being reliant on the public for their funds (and are instead reliant on government cash), they cease to be responsive to the public.</p>

<p>It&#39;s why the legacy media can promote narratives that are deeply unpopular with the people, and they signal their indifference to protest. </p>

<p>One example is the thoroughgoing unpopularity of, say, something like [I&#39;m just pulling this out of the ether] but mixed-race relationships. Less than 5% of the public engages in them. As recently as 2014, a Cheerio&#39;s commercial was the first ad to draw an uproar when it portrayed a mixed-race couple and their biracial child. Wherever you stand on the issue, the reality is: The public is NOT where the elites are on the topic.</p>

<p>So while less than 5% of actual Americans engage in mixed-race relationships, you&#39;ve suddenly seen this concerted effort to promote the phenomenon on TV commercials, where a full 1/3rd of all ads now feature mixed-race couples.</p>

<p>Let me repeat: This phenomenon was unusual as recently as 2014.</p>

<p>Yet by 2018, it went from 1 Cheerio&#39;s commercial, to every third commercial. </p>

<p>Clearly, the public isn&#39;t into the social engineering campaign. Yet it&#39;s being promoted anyway.</p>

<p>This would NOT happen in a media that &quot;gives the public what they want&quot;. It happens in a media immune from the public because they&#39;re getting dark money from the Deep State.</p>

<p>And that&#39;s just one manifestation of what I&#39;m talking about. There are countless other examples of stuff the public isn&#39;t into, yet its promoted aggressively by the elites. (Transgenderism would be another.) </p>

<p>It gives a lie to the claim that &quot;TV just provides what the public wants.&quot;</p>

<p>The reality is far, far darker.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My issue with this is that you&#39;re basically employing a &quot;no TRUE news site would write something so stupid&quot;, when... not an attempt to insult the entire userbase, but there&#39;s a whole lot of right-wing and conspiracy people who do believe dumb shit like this on a daily basis.</p>

<p>What makes you think a fringe right-wing news site WOULDN&#39;T use one picture of a guy as proof he was a Clinton staffer? That shit has been and will keep happening forever. And it definitely does more harm than good. Less people are going to look up and debunk it than believe it wholesale.</p>

<p>The basis of your argument seems to be &quot;we&#39;re not that stupid!&quot;, well. Even if you&#39;re not, there definitely people in your community who are.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Your News Wire needs to be shut down. They are the worst sort of fake news that makes all other alternative news websites look bad. </p>

<p>They run their operation through this Facebook page: <a href="https://www.facebook.com/thepeoplesvoicetv/">https://www.facebook.com/thepeoplesvoicetv/</a></p>

<p>There&#39;s one way to find out if they are controlled opposition: If everyone here goes to their Facebook page and reports all of their posts, and nothing happens, then they are protected by Facebook.</p>

<p>Facebook is supposed to be shutting down fake news pages yet they seem to be thriving while high quality pages are having their reach severely cut, with some even being deleted altogether.</p>

<p>If Facebook continues to support them, then I think you&#39;re theory that they are controlled opposition is correct.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think that like with any effective controlled opposition, you first need to provide some <em>actually</em> useful/accurate stories or conspiracies, in order to first gain some kind of credibility. I can remember a time when they weren&#39;t as batshit as they are today.</p>

<p>At the same time, by posting a story to YNW, you can then immediately discredit that story anywhere else it may pop up, by claiming that the origin of the story is a site known for producing bull shit.</p>

<p>Serves two purposes. Glad people have started to realize this. I&#39;m not against people posting links to YNW here, just so long as everyone is EXTREMELY skeptical and verifies any and all claims made in an article before believing any of it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m a Trump-optimist Q Anon weirdo and even I don&#39;t trust yournewswire. Not everything they publish is necessarily false, but they are more like click-bait in my opinion. They have very low standards and publish whatever will grab attention.</p>
