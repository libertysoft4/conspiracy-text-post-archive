        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Since the dawn of History men have often fought to reach the top of the food chain.Men were naturally aggressive and goal oriented in their lives before the gradual advent of the 21st century.The straight forwardness of men has caused them to often be adversaries of the powerful and in most cases checks to power. </p>

<p>it was men in USA who fought for independence since they didn&#39;t want to pay another mans living expenses.It was men that went to civil war to fight for what they believed was right. </p>

<p>By now you get the point, men are naturally Masculine hence the name.Although masculinity does have its draw backs it&#39;s pivotal to a functioning society.</p>

<p>I believe that the Government and certain powerful figures are using their power to break the masculine cycle.They are pushing for a new type of male. A more feminine man a kinder , selfless male.One devoid of masculinity and filled to the brim with propaganda.</p>

<p>Why would they be doing this? Simple! An emasculated man is a docile man , one who doesn&#39;t fight for what he believes.One he simply conforms to power because he is afraid of conflict.</p>

<p>Here at ConspiringConspiracists we will be judging the plausibility of this theory over the next week through immersive content.</p>

<p>But please tell us , what do you think about this?</p>

<p>I don&#39;t understand why people get flak for linking to their own content. All it means is that the owner/author will create a sock puppet, or ask/beg someone else to post the link for him. How is that any better? Tricking someone to view your content because it appears to be some organic event is not being truthful nor is it in the spirit of this community to act that way when it&#39;s one of the very things we try to expose on a daily basis. News companies and dirty moderators use those shady tactics.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Aggression channeled into productivity changes nations.There is obviously a spectrum, society it seems is pushing us towards a complete neutering of aggression.</p>

<p>What you are describing is machevillianism.Men are inherently selfless most likely due to them being providers in early hunter gatherer eras.The shift to machevillianism is extremely difficult and takes willfull effort along with fluidity in mindset.</p>

<p>It&#39;s also of my opinion that machevillianism needs an internal aggression skill fully wrapped in stinging words.Questions which wound an opponent need to have an underlying aggression behind them.Something general films and media portray as &quot;ungentlemently&quot; in a guy.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Men are not being emasculated but they are facing seismic shifts in our world that require them to adapt and evolve.  But the culprit is not a government or a group but a changing society that over the last 50 years moved from tight knit communities with extended families and someone always at home to a society where the family ran away from that community to the suburbs and then began divorcing at massive rates leaving single parent household and even when they did stay together, both parents would have to work and thus the real culprit: childhood isolation (aka - latch key kids).</p>

<p>With the absent parents and the disappearing extended family, millions upon millions of children (for decades now) are being left alone with zero feedback and boundaries in their formative years (10-18).  When isolation occurs in these years, children do not grow, do not develop life lessons like socialization, dating, self love, peer relationships....they don&#39;t learn to take care of themselves in all the ways society requires (jobs, family, partners, friends).  Instead the develop social anxiety, depression, exaggerated egos that shield them from truth.  They internalize traumatic events from childhood and never move past them. They are essentially stuck at the emotional age where they were left to their own devices.  </p>

<p>Then they chronologically grow up but the inner self stays stuck at that childish emotional age.  They even have a name for it and therapy that specifically addresses it: Adult Children (most of the science done on it is from the massive studies they did on alcoholic families which turn out to be the perfect test case for these adult children).</p>

<p>So blaming females or a secret group is a waste of time IF you want to get better.  There is help folks and MRA. MGTOW and redpill is not the answer.  Getting into therapy and working on growing up your inner emotional age and self are the keys.  You literally have to learn to be your &#39;own good parent&#39; and help that &#39;child behind the wheel&#39; of your life become the man or the woman that they never grew into.</p>

We are evolving and many of the challenges that people perceive as originating with an abandonment of traditional values are actually connected to a rediscovery of what traditional values actually were before civilization stripped us of our humanity. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Honestly I think we have way too little shame as it is. A little shame is healthy to regulate your own behavior. The reason I don&#39;t steal isn&#39;t because it&#39;s illegal. The reason is that inflicting unjust loss on others and thereby causing them distress is <em>shameful</em> to me and I empathize with how they would feel when being deprived of whatever it was I would have stolen.</p>

<p>If you have no shame, you have no reason not to act entirely rationally like a psychopathic robot and that is not how stable and caring societies are made. There&#39;s a utility in shame, juts don&#39;t let it cripple you. Finding the balance is the key to good parenting.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you&#39;re really interested in shame, it&#39;s a fascinating topic.  Toxic shame (internalized, exaggerated, self loathing shame) is the underpinning of all these ills.  I super strongly suggest reading an AMAZINg book called &quot;Healing the Shame that Binds&quot; </p>

<p>Basically this bad form of shame makes it impossible to grow because at ts core the erson thinks they are broken and the shame just hides it all.  That boom changed my life.</p>

The only part that is nefarious to me is the folks that since the 60s have been killing the economy with tax cuts for the rich, deregulation and numerous other aspects that made it impossible for single earners to support of family.  Both parents having to work is the only thing I see as intentional (income inequality, rich getting al the net gains, etc).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh I totally agree that it&#39;s less of a nefarious business situation and more something natural.  For a while I was super interested in the globalist bankers, Monopoly corporations, etc, all in search of the peak of The Pyramid of Power.  But I quickly realized the Cap Stone isn&#39;t an individual or entity, but just human greed.</p>

<p>When we get to that conclusion it&#39;s less of an Evil Genius take over the world mentality. BUT, think about competition and cooperation. Imagine you&#39;re one of the few multi billionaires. How did you get to that point? Manipulation, coersion, domination.  Now since you&#39;re in a league of only a handful of others, and your network is so vast as to maintain your riches, then you MUST discuss with there other billionaires.  This creates cartels, shared but secret invested interests, under the table dealings, corruption, etc.</p>

<p>Basically I just think that naturally humans would lead to this point, and that when I think it was intentional, it&#39;s like all these powerful dudes knew they had to work together or else they eat each other alive.  That&#39;s probably also a rich person past time in itself, but I think that the &quot;Illuminati&quot; exists conceptually.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>just human greed.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Bingo.</p>

<p>IMHO, the real rabbit hole, especially in America, is that since we were colonies, we&#39;ve had a strikingly stunning and creepy repetition going on between the two poles of our ideology: conservatism versus progressivism.</p>

<p>Sociologists and such have devoted lifetime studies tracking how with stunning regularity we lean conservative for like 40 years and then switch back to leaning progressive.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The cyclical theory refers to a model used by historian Arthur Schlesinger to attempt to explicate the fluctuations in politics throughout American history. Liberalism and conservatism are rooted in the &quot;national mood&quot; that shows a continuing shift in national involvement between public purpose and private interest. Each of these cycles includes a phase of dominant public interest, a transition phase, and a phase of prevalent private interest.</p>

<p>Schlesinger defined these to be &quot;self-generating and autonomous&quot;. They begin in the mentality of the masses, rather than creations of influential individuals of a time period. Leaders or politicians are representations of the &quot;mood&quot;, chosen to express the voice of the majority. Shifts in the national mentality are initiated when discontent with present conditions over time drives Americans to pursue a new trend that promises to satisfy the interest of the masses. This discontent, described by Schlesinger as &quot;inextinguishable&quot;, drives the cycles of change in national politics.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And believing wholeheartedly in this ridiculous repetition I can see we are at the junctures of one of the switches.  Post WWII was extremely progressive till the early 70s when it flipped back conservative and since then we&#39;ve seen the conservatism wreak havoc. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Here&#39;s a crazy theory that will get me downvoted.  </p>

<p>Women are naturally easier to control mentally, men more easily physically.  Assuming gender roles and things like that are natural, think about how all throughout history the social chains men wear is physical labor, work of some kind.  With women, it&#39;s been entirely mental, with marriage rights, and other inequalities.  </p>

<p>I think that They realize it&#39;s much easier to control &quot;feminine&quot; minds, and so I think the large push towards LGBT everything on the youth is to make everyone more feminine and easier to control mentally. We no longer live in a physical world of going to the factory and coming home to a home cooked meal.  The world is temporal now, so it makes sense to make everyone the homogenous.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Whenever the subject of the feminization of western men shows up, it is immediately downvoted into oblivion. </p>

<p>It&#39;s so obvious to an old guy like me. I look around when I&#39;m out and about and I just cringe. I don&#39;t have anything against effeminate men, it&#39;s just that there seems to be so many now I can&#39;t help but wonder why. Soft, weak and fat. Bad posture, pasty complexion and unconfident demeanor...when at the same time women are becoming more masculine...it&#39;s no wonder marriages are failing at well over 50%. The natural instinctive roles of men and  women are being attacked as &quot;POLITICALLY INCORRECT&quot;. Women are miserable because their men  are too weak and useless when it comes to performing traditional mens work around the yard and house. Some can&#39;t even start a fucking lawnmower. Cultural Marxism is a plague meant to destroy western society and it&#39;s starting to actually destroy western society. Feminism is a component of that pile of shit...attacking men for simply being Masculine. Masculinity and a MANS forward thinking is what is needed to survive what may end up being some very tough times ahead of us. Effeminate men will just sit in a corner and cry while their feminist wives scream at them to do something when the shit hits the fan.</p>

but I agree that SJWism IS damaging the culture of society to some degree. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t know what this so called &quot;cultural marxism&quot; thing is that some people throw around, (I don&#39;t think it&#39;s the correct term). But EXTREME political correctness / SJW-ism is modern propaganda that the establishment manufactured to shit on actual woke pro-working class leftists, divide men and women and maybe make men more docile and women more obnoxious (dividing couples). I know not all men/women fit their gender properly, and that&#39;s ok. But there is
a HUGE ARTIFICIAL PUSH to turn large numbers of men docile, and women into aggressive man wannabes, divide the people, etc. It&#39;s degeneracy and not natural to push this wide for it. Acceptance is NOT the same as pushing it artificially.
Imagine men and women all swapping masculinity/femininity. Fucked up society. There&#39;s a reason it&#39;s not natural.
The anomalies (lack of kinder word) should not be considered the norm. Respect the anomalies but don&#39;t push it lol wtf.</p>

<p>Toxins, plastics, processed soy, third wave feminism bullshit, pushing trans stuff on children (they can&#39;t make decisions for themselves at that age), etc.

    <div class="md"><p>The only thing I can think of, is to educate those around you, very calmly. If SJWs are too close minded and will rage, just agree to disagree and leave the conversation, offering to return to the debate if they&#39;re open minded and calm to continue -- that&#39;s better than fueling divide and conquer. Another option is just trying to calm them down by sympathizing with them. &quot;You want female equality right? I want the same thing + male equality. Humanism is a sensible alternative to feminism. But realize the most EXTREME inequality is against all WORKERS my friends&quot;.</p>

<p>Plant the seed of the truth. Shifting away from divide and conquer male vs female, and instead to workers vs extremist oligarchs (the haves vs the have nots, i.e. establishment vs working/middle/upper middle classes).</p>

<p>Explain arguments like this:</p>

<p>Establishment sponsored SJW argument: &quot;the problem with the world is white male patriarchy, we need more female elites, I mean female CEOs&quot;.</p>

<p>Then compare to a reasonable person:</p>

<p>&quot;nope, the problem is the corrupt elites hoarding extreme amounts of wealth at everyone elses expense. The gender or race of the oligarchs or puppet means nothing. We should do things like regulate corporations with a democratically controlled/not bribed government, break up monopolies, remove money from politics, nationalize the FED, remove cronyism from social programs, etc.&quot;</p>

<p>Stuff like that. The other extreme side of the coin is the people who think &quot;SJW = leftist&quot; which is nonsense. The distinction should be made about leftist economics (pro-worker). Even normal leftist social issues like &quot;protect vulnerable groups like victims, women, minorities, etc.&quot; has been twisted 
into crap like &quot;white male patriarchy, Clinton is a woman, she should be president!&quot; lol. Representation means nothing if
the puppet is part of the establishment. Jill Stein was a million times better than Clinton. But gender doesn&#39;t matter, policies do.</p>

<p>I believe &quot;SJW&quot; crap is authoritarian but not really something you can put on the spectrum just like racism.
NWO corporate take over is way bigger of an issue:</p>

Common ground with SJWs can turn them into more reasonable people....hopefully.</p>

hence I avoid meaningless terms like that and go for exact, specific names for things. When I say &quot;SJW&quot; there is no confusion what I mean.

    <div class="md"><p>They ruined everything when they split up power and made it meaningless. Every polytheistic God is a progenitor of an ethnicity just like monotheistic prophets. The Hebrews were lower class and subject to imprisonment just like me now because the upper class didn&#39;t know what to do with them and wanted to punish them for literally who they are rather than anything they had control over. My back hurts and I don&#39;t have that much energy. I will say that monotheistic religion is inherently more racist than what came before it.</p>

<p>Power is not over a particular thing. You either have absolute power or your ethnicity is being oppressed by division of power giving nobody it&#39;s benefit.</p>

<p>If we were stuck on an island with everyone on the world (bare with my back pain) and there was one unit of food left, but only one person could eat it, would you forbid eating it?</p>

<p>I know this is super lame and really sucks but that&#39;s life kid we&#39;re not unique magical creatures. Also coveting of power is retarded because when in power the person transforms and kind of just does eerily almost the same thing as certain other rulers who share certain genetic traits that get activated only when they have absolute power. Some mammals change so much that they grow fuzzy patches of hair on their groins when they&#39;re dominant. Our species can be fooled more easily than them. Kim jong ils son doesn&#39;t have any PHYSICAL traits that are there just because he sort of has unlimited power. My point however is that it&#39;s illogical to directly covet power because it&#39;s one of those paradoxes where what does it matter what color the grass is if your fricking eyes change when you stand on your neighbors lawn while he barbeques?</p>

<p>Do you realize that in addition to fluoridating water, why, there are studies underway to fluoridate salt, flour, fruit juices, soup, sugar, milk, ice cream? Ice cream, Mandrake? Children&#39;s ice cream!...You know when fluoridation began?...1946. 1946, Mandrake. How does that coincide with your post-war Commie conspiracy, huh? It&#39;s incredibly obvious, isn&#39;t it? A foreign substance is introduced into our precious bodily fluids without the knowledge of the individual, and certainly without any choice. That&#39;s the way your hard-core Commie works. I first became aware of it, Mandrake, during the physical act of love... Yes, a profound sense of fatigue, a feeling of emptiness followed. Luckily I — I was able to interpret these feelings correctly. Loss of essence. I can assure you it has not recurred, Mandrake. Women, er, women sense my power, and they seek the life essence. I do not avoid women, Mandrake...but I do deny them my essence.</p>
