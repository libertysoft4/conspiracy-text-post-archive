        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Note: Stop reading if you have not watched the movie yet and do not want to be spoilered.</p>

<p>I have paid the cinema a visit yesterday to see Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom.</p>

<p>It is clear that the main message of the movie is that of dire &quot;greenwashing&quot; - the main characters are trying to protect creatures that have been brought to the planet by the unnatural way of genetic technology under the premise of &quot;saving animals&quot;, not understanding that they are going to destroy the ecosystem if they won&#39;t let them die out. In the end, the girl Masie sets dozens of live dinosaurs free from their cages, finally bringing terror upon the world - and it doesn&#39;t look like she will be made responsible for the thousands of death that will surely ensue in the next JW movie.</p>

<p>However, one single scene is even more unnerving. During the Indoraptor chase within the premises of the mansion, Masie encounters the monster in an exhibit of taxidermised dinosaurs. We can see her face being reflected by a glass pane, with the face of the beast closing in, creating a &quot;crossfade&quot; effect and implying that Masie is turning into a reptile.</p>

<p>It is implied in the movie that Masie, Benjamin Lockwood&#39;s granddaughter, has been cloned in order to replicate his daughter. It is highly likely, at least in Hollywood, that some Dinosaur DNA was &quot;snuck&quot; in in the process.</p>

<p>In support of this theory lies the bedroom scene - the (male) Indoraptor does not attempt to kill the girl immediately. It is possible that he sees her as a possible mate!</p>

<p>I have immediately thought of Reptilians when seeing this. Is this possibly a Reptilian-themed subliminal message?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think you&#39;re definitely on to something. I wish I had the source handy, but it was either a reviewer or someone talking about the production- and they mentioned that in the long gap between movies 3 and 4 there were multiple script ideas/treatments being worked on that involved Dino-Human hybrids. </p>

<p>In your opinion, if for the sake of discussion the girl was in fact cloned with some reptile DNA, is she fully human? Or is there maybe something there about all of us having some beast within? -To clarify, personally I full human &amp;not a dinosaur. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think that she is not really fully human, per definitionem, if carrying reptile (paleo)DNA. In fact, she might have saved the dinosaurs for the same reason a human saves other humans.</p>

<p>Also, I once again stress the point that the Indoraptor probably attempted to mate with her.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The messages are not of a &quot;Reptile&quot; as in &quot;Dinosaurs are reptiles&quot; but certainly of the &quot;Reptilian&quot; as in &quot;Lizard People&quot; theme. The human/dino DNA splice. The human face turning into a reptile face. Don&#39;t you understand what I am implying?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I understand. The &quot;lizard people&quot; conspiracy is one of the best, because it is so outlandish to the general population that no one will be taken seriously to the masses. But there are groups who know what is going on. Believe it or not the human race has <em>cough</em> possibly allready been genetically modified. We currently have a &quot;repitlian&quot; part of our brain. Mainstream science calls our &quot;old brain&quot;, &quot;reptilian&quot;. Most if not all of Hollywood movies allude to events or scenerios that have allready happened or are planned to happen. One love my brothers and sisters, do not doubt your instincts.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I enjoyed your theory and its points all seem plausible. Hollyweird is certainly obsessed with the notion of this desire for the transfusion of our DNA with some type of superior genetic DNA and its guaranteed modification. Kinda like Alchemy, taking two different separate parts, bringing together and producing a third that is which entirely new. A society whom in reality is forced to upgrade or become extinct. One must fuse together with its predator or simply be consumed by it.</p>
