        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I&#39;m just starting my journey down the crypto currency rabbit hole, and I&#39;m just curious as to how ICO&#39;s and cryptos manage to bypass the laws against pyramid schemes. I tried looking into this and can&#39;t find much info of reputtable source, are there any federal laws against pyramid schemes in the U.S. or is that left up to each state? And if so does that mean that as long as your company is based in a state without laws directly against pyramid schemes that it doesn&#39;t break the laws if you sell to people in states with laws against it?</p>

<p>Definition of pyramid scheme from investopedia</p>

<blockquote>
<p>A pyramid scheme is an illegal investment scam based on a hierarchical setup. New recruits make up the base of the pyramid and provide the funding, or so-called returns, the earlier investors/recruits above them receive. A pyramid scheme does not involve the selling of products. Rather, it relies on the constant inflow of money from additional investors that works its way to the top of the pyramid.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Is somebody getting paid off at the upper levels to look the other way, or did some smart people just figure out a way to make a business plan based in this style of investments that isn&#39;t technically illegal?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Because it isnt a pyramid scheme.. I&#39;ve been studying an investing in cryptos for over a year. Also any decentralized (most) cryptos arnt owned by anybody. It is owned by each user. So let&#39;s say there is 1 total BTC. I own .25, you own .50, and bob owns .25. You own 50% of that coin. It is publically owned and there is no 3rd party. Some ICOs are a scam and they are called scam coins. We need more regulation to solve this problem but it will be solved. That is why before you invest look at the dev team, read the whitepapers, and look at the community behind it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You seem pretty well versed, thank you for the info. I know there are plenty of legitimate cryptos, I guess scamcoins is the term I was looking for. But yeah, it seems like there are quite a few start up ICO&#39;s that literally fit the exact mold of a pyramid scheme. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sorry I guess I did word that weird.. I meant in the sense that almost 50% of ICO&#39;s failed last year, and it seems like quite a few were from &quot;take the money and run&quot; reasons.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Most investors stay away from ICOs but if you hop in the right one you can make quite a bit of money. ICOs are pretty much the best of both worlds of IPOs and crowd funding. They just need more regulation to avoid P&amp;Ds and scam coins. The market is still so adolescent.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Scam &quot;coins&quot; are typically a token (ethereum ERC-20 tokens) and not a proof of work blockchain like bitcoin is.</p>

<p>It&#39;s super easy for anyone to make an ERC-20 token.</p>

<p>Many shady companies were starting ICOs to get around doing a formal IPO.   The FTC is cracking down on ICOs really HARD. John McAfee was warned by the FTC and he himself said any one operating an ICO is going to get destroyed by the FTC very soon. </p>

<p>Cryptocurrencies are fantastic and have a very bright future. Unfortunately the market is saturated with shit coins, only a small percentage of the current 1600+ cryptos will survive. Be wary of tokens in general, proof of work and proof of stake coins etc are not immune.</p>

<p>As with any other investment you really need to do your due diligence and do your homework.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I read Amazon (innovation) was taking bids from companies to provide nodes for a new cryto currency.  Only 20+ companies would be selected.  The selection is going on as we speak.  Sounds like the role of nodes will be different in this system or I am a total idiot and misunderstood the whole thing?  I do know of a company the submitted.  Maybe they rule or govern the nodes farm. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think you&#39;d have to give a specific example if you want a real answer.  Bitcoin, for instance, is not a pyramid scheme any more than any other digital product.  It has a use and a market value and there is no transfer of funds between anyone by any third party.  Bitcoins exist just like any other digital item.  You buy them.  You sell them.  That&#39;s pretty much the extent of it.  The worst you can say is that they are like Beanie Babies, perhaps.</p>

<p>Something like Bitconnect, though, might be a good candidate.  Even though it looked very much like a pyramid scheme and collapsed just like one, I&#39;m pretty sure it skated by because it seemed to be based almost exactly on how the existing banking system works.  It was actually fairly ingenuously designed, because there was technically no difference between it and any mainstream bank that offers interest on deposits, and at the same time it was almost guaranteed to fail just like a pyramid scheme.  So regulators didn&#39;t really have much of an argument with which to indict it.</p>

<p>And I imagine most of those involved knew the eventual outcome.  In fact, I spoke with one person last year who knew that it was destined to fail and was still going to buy some anyways to hold for a few months, hoping to sell closer to the top.  I&#39;m not sure whether he did or not.</p>
