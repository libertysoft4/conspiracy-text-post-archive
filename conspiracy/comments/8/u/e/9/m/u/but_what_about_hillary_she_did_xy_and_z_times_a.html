<p>This tactic of defending the president of the United States using his predecessors and his opponents is fine. I just say, what about them? If you have evidence and can beat a lawyer in court without resolving to &quot;deep state&quot;. Do it. Otherwise it&#39;s not a real defense and it looks silly using it in defense of a president of which I have on video lying to me from the beginning. </p>

<p>HRC, Obama, Tom Perez, DWS, Kamala Harris, Deval Patrick, Corey Booker, Joe Kennedy III...they all work together, believe in the same corrupt, Neolib/Neocon worldview, and must be seen as one entity if we are to take the Party from their cold, corrupt hands. </p>

<p>Lol same old talking points. Let me school ya a bit, bud.</p>

<p>Bernie has a house in Vermont he&#39;s owned for 30 years and has a mortgage on. He has an apartment in DC, and his wife Jane recently received an inheritance and with it they bought a vacation home. Not all that insane when you look at the <em>facts</em>. Lol.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Bernie&#39;s Presidential campaign recieved no lobbyist money, unless you consider Unions like the Nurses Union a lobby, in which case, guilt as charge. Lol.</p>

<p>So advocating for Medicare for All, Universal Education, a Green New Deal etc; isn&#39;t Left? You sure are being disingenuous there bud. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>And &quot;left&quot; is a matter of economic policy over a view on SJW culture.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Wrong. True Left takes an approach to both because it realizes that you can&#39;t have Social Policy w/o Economic Policy. Try to keep up.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Honestly &quot;democratic socialists&quot; scare me more than Republicans or pinko tankies. They&#39;ll give the people stuff but within the realm of capitalist laws.</p>

<p>You can&#39;t have true Socialism or post-scarcity Communism without first creating the culture of Socialism necessary to maintain it. This is what Social Democracy and Dem Socs are all about. </p>

<blockquote>

<p>Nope, they say real Leftist stuff like to nationalize healthcare and college education. Your picking and choosing is cute tho ;D </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Laws very by state, but ultimately sexual assault is all about consent. Some states could consider Bill and Monicas situation as rape since he was in a position of authority. (A very high position)</p>

<p>According to
<a href="https://www.rainn.org/articles/legal-role-consent">https://www.rainn.org/articles/legal-role-consent</a> </p>

<p>Relationship of victim/perpetrator: Was the alleged perpetrator in a position of authority, such as such as a teacher or correctional office?</p>

<p>In an article for Vanity Fair, Lewinsky wrote she now realizes that her relationship with Clinton &quot;constituted a gross abuse of power.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Sure my boss took advantage of me, but I will always remain firm on this point: it was a consensual relationship,&quot; </p>

<p>Lewinsky says she now sees that her relationship with Clinton was full of &quot;inappropriate abuse of authority, station, and privilege.&quot; </p>

<p>She definitely gives mixed signals and suffers ptsd from the entire ordeal. I don&#39;t think it&#39;s too much of stretch to classify it as rape. It being a national political controversy has obviously obfuscated the matter.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It just says or, or both. That part.</p>

<p>See the thing is, is context and nuance. Hillary was technically in possession of top secret clearance which would privy her to that information but apparently not how it&#39;s stored. What if she asked the president and he said yes?  </p>

<p>But anyway, I think you can see the nuance in it. I believe that if you really went zero tolerance on the law then yes, she could be fined and unable to run for president over storage of emails but I highly doubt jail time nor will they go after Karl Rove for doing the same thing with the RNC when Bush&#39;s Republicans &quot;lost&quot; 3 million emails. </p>

<p>This is classic Fox news brainwashing. Nothing but emotional outcry to jail all political opponents. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It is no secret she committed crimes. She was using a personal email server to bypass the FOIA system and the records keeping act to hide her actions from public scrutiny. And in doing so she violated laws concerning the handling of classified material. Then when a subpoena was issued for the emails she violated the subpoena and obstructed justice by destroying evidence. </p>

<p>These crimes are all well known. But Clinton was so entrenched in the deep state corruption that her cronies tried to pull off a cover up. </p>

<p>Why would a normal person not want a criminal like her held accountable for her crimes?</p>
