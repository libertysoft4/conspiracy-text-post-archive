        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I thought this theory was completely bullshit. Then I looked more into it... and I still think its probably bullshit. Although there quite a few weird coincidences I can&#39;t explain...</p>

<p>Yes, this part of the song is clearly about sending nudes... but it also obviously has a double entendre. Drake and most good rappers are known for these. Look how this verse ends:
    &quot;Why you keep on shootin&#39; if you know that nigga dead? (Skrr)&quot;</p>

<p>Also this part of the song repeats &quot;(Skrr)&quot;... the only other part of the song that uses &quot;(Skrr)&quot; is when he says 
    &quot;Made me wanna buy a vest and a TEC (Skrr)&quot;
A TEC is a TEC-9... a semi-automatic pistol. Immediately following the gun makes it clear that &quot;(Skrr)&quot; represents a car pulling up/shooting. Look up &quot;(Skrr)&quot; it is literally gang slang for a car pulling up/shooting. Strange that it is only at these two parts of the song... and that a car pulled up and shot X. Also strange that in his music video Drake has a couple gunshot sounds for when the speakers blow...</p>

<p>&quot;SMS&quot; is short for send my shooters.</p>

<p>One meaning of &quot;triple X&quot; is obviously &quot;XXXTentacion&quot;, play the song on Spotify and even there you will see that in the lyric description it says this is most likely an XXXTentacion diss. 
You can also hear &quot;x...x...x&quot; whispered before this part of the song.</p>

<p>The part in the song leading up to this has nothing to do with sending nudes to his ex. Instead it is about someone trying to &quot;check him&quot;, which is a double entendre for challenging him as the king and also for accusing him of something (X said Drake stole his song, X said Drake&#39;s mom has an STD, X may have told Pusha T about Drake&#39;s baby).
    &quot;You tryna check?</p>

<p>The next part is a threat about how this is real life and there are real repercussions (getting killed?) for trying to check Drake.
    &quot;This is real life, niggas think we playin&#39; chess&quot;</p>

<p>Drake is acting like something evil took over him and made him do something cold.
    So what&#39;s next?
    Jump up out the bed like I’m possessed&quot;
    ...
    Got a lot of blood and it&#39;s cold&quot;</p>

<p>The whole song is about sending shooters and ordering a hit. 
     &quot;I&#39;m upset
      Hunnid thousand on my head, it&#39;s disrespect&quot;
       ...
     &quot;They keep tryna get me for my soul (for my soul)&quot; [This could also hint &quot;they&quot; tempted him to lose his soul by ordering a hit]</p>

<p>XXXTentacion was shot in the heart, that is why he did not bleed out significantly and instantly slumped after being shot. There was no visible shots or blood in the video of his deceased body slumped in the car. Witnesses saw him get shot below the neck/on the chest. 
    &quot;That&#39;s the only time I ever shoot below the neck (skrr)&quot;</p>

<p>He was shot multiple times in the chest, even after being hit in the heart. Witnesses heard multiple gunshots. Lack of bleeding signifies that he was already dead before the rest of the shots, or at the very least the shooters knew he was already dead. When you get shot multiple times in your center of mass it is typically because someone wants you dead, not just to rob you.
    &quot;Why you keep on shootin&#39; if you know that nigga dead? (Skrr)&quot;</p>

<p>Drake had major beef with XXXTentacion. Drake is close with real criminals/killers. Drake wants to appear tough. Drake&#39;s label owner Birdman has even been accused of ordering a hit in 2015 by one of the attempted murderers after he was caught. During one of his concerts Kanye said that Jay Z and probably other big names have shooters (he mentioned Drake right before Jay Z, Drake&#39;s next album has Jay Z on it). One of X&#39;s last live videos is him anticipating his death and basically saying goodbye. X also posted online that if anyone kills him it is Drake. Weird coincidence? I think its just a coincidence.. but sure there is a small possibility.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Listening to drakes album “Scorpion” and I overheard this bar while reading this. The track “Talk up ft. Jay-Z” 2:43  Jay says “ya’ll killed X let zimmerman live”. X died as recently as June 18th and I know for a fact Jay-Z just dissed him on The Album “Everything is love” that dropped the day prior to X’s death. Did they settle that bad blood and collab on a track in that short period of time? Maybe I’m reaching but I have a feeling X’s death was premeditated and I just cannot shake the thought since it infiltrated my head. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That bar literally has nothing to do Nas and all to do with drake..  In 2015 Drake turned down the opportunity for independence and co-ownership in TIDAL for a $19 million contract with Apple Music. In December 2017 Drake joined Lil Wayne on his remix of Hov’s “Family Feud.” In his verse Drizzy declared he would require equity in the company if he was sign with Apple again—something Hov had offered him the first time around with TIDAL. Instead of working with Jay to grow their own Black-owned company together, Drake signed with Apple—“the man” -Rap Genius. Not sure why an artist on Nas’s tier would come to Jay-Z for a deal lol but this is all speculation. Just interesting to think about</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You also have Soulja Kidd, who claims he had nothing to do with the shooting in the area at the time of the shooting, with a pistol that matched caliber X was shot with posting pictures of it to social media within a 10 minute walk. Also matching the original description circulating that the shooter had a red mask. His Instagram is full of suspect shit.</p>

<p>He reps &quot;XXX&quot; and is from Broward County and claims he has never heard of XXXTENTACION in videos on Instagram, which seems completely bogus.</p>

<p>He&#39;s also been popping up at various record labels and recently posted a picture alongside Birdman.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is retarded. </p>

<p>SMS has to do with text messaging. 
XXX has to do with sending a nude pic. 
Shooting below the neck specifies that he’s sending a dick pick. </p>

<p>Implying that normally he aims for the head which would be like a sniper shot or just a really good shot. That implication ties in with the way he dominates other rappers. The metaphor being that sending a dick pic is the only time he shoots(takes a picture) below the neck and that any other time - shooting in the head or dominating other rappers is his normal course of action. </p>

<p>I’m too high to finish this but this theory is dumb. </p>

<p>All I’m saying is drake is no stranger to these tactics. He probably has goons on his payroll who handle his “problems” for him. So it’s not completely out of the Realm of possibility that he had X dealt with. Especially if X had provided some info to Pusha T in regards to the  Story of Adidon diss. Just food for thought..</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, it sure gave me some goosebumps. Imagine making some kind of art that delves into the notion of your own mortality. Then imagine facing death almost immediately after.

<p>But given my general obliviousness, I’ll probably be just thinking about how aliens probably made the pyramids and then suddenly get run over by a bus. Not nearly as beautiful in the grand scheme of things. Then again, at least I’m alive now to appreciate the significance of XXX’s kismet detachment from this mortal coil. Man I’m high. </p>

All the memorials, funerals and vigils are done and he dropped his probably, last music video. No better time for Drake to come in and drop an album and try to make people forget about X.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Could XXX have put a hit on Drake for 50k for duping his song? </p>

<p>But eventually updated it to 100k?</p>

<p>Could that be what the chorus is referring to? </p>

<p>Why would sending nudes to a ex require you to get a vest and a TEC?  Like, that&#39;s some black mirror shit that only happens in fantasies. </p>

<p>Who cares. </p>

<p>His music wasn’t helping society get any better... that’s for sure.. </p>

<p>The entire rap genre is a big joke to me because it self perpetuates violence against its own listeners - because thug life. </p>
