        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Ive been thinking and since I learnt about this fortunate jewish family, they control the central banks but what if they just were a rich jew family and they were a distraction even on the conspiracy level. I proposed this opinion to my friends and he responded back with &quot;how come they never mentioned on mainstream media?&quot; </p>

<p>So then I responded and thought what if there was 2 or 3 layers of manipulation, Mainstream media pretty much inform the &#39;mass&#39; which we know dont care and carry on their lives while people likes us who are in to conspiracies and such &#39;believe&#39; the rothschild rule the world. </p>

<p>If I ruled the world, I would use so much scapegoats to deflects my real identity, it seems like human instinct to do this. </p>

<p>I&#39;m not &#39;defending&#39; the jewish family, but my gut feeling tells me the rothschild are the distraction even tho they own the central banks of the world, I still feel someone beyond them either control them or make a great cover to deflect their own greed and ambition.</p>

<p>What if they just a distraction even to our levels (forget about the mass)? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The fact that they struggle so much between each other in order to reach papacy is proof of it. Those nobles serve in a ceremonial way only, they were even excluded from the papal court in the 1960s under Paul VI.</p>

<p>The Jesuits obey no one but their superiors and the black pope in the end. The superior general is seen as god like figure to them and they are supposed to obey him no matter what. A lot of the traditions of the jesuits have a lot of similarities to communism.</p>

<p>I know it&#39;s not a good source, but it shows that the Jesuits were and are the tools of the nobility. They have the money and the power to be the puppet masters.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The black nobility are supposed to descend from the Venetians, that descended from the Phonecians, that descended from the Sumerians. We&#39;re talking roughly 4,000-5,000 of bloodlines. These people have had power for a long time through cutthroat ways. If you look at the Kingdom of Italy, it was only gone what, 1940&#39;s? If you look at the Phonecians, they gained wealth and status through selling of slaves and other heinous acts. </p>

<p>Ultimately they are Semitic. Not Jewish, but Semitic. So people from Syria and Iraq have a closer relation to them than Jews.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>These useless eaters made a mistake. They joined a pyramid scheme that sells a defective product. </p>

<p><strong>These negative ETs, coalescent parasites, sell other pieces of God&#39;s consciousness to deceive and coerce others to override their free will and persuit of happiness in order to enhance the free will and persuit of happiness for themselves.</strong></p>

<p>As these suckers comply, they also lose free will and the persuit of happiness due to the overbearing behavior of their managers. It&#39;s a pyramid scheme of spiritual exploitation and enslavement.</p>

<p>To be a good person is to do exactly the opposite. It is to treat others the way you would want to be treated. It is to seek to enhance the free will and persuit of happiness of all, not just for the self even at the expense of others.</p>

<p>The difference between the paths is extreme. </p>

<p>When the hierarchy is cut off from its spiritual food, the fear and suffering of others, it becomes like Orboros, a snake eating itself. It is like Dr. Kevorkian&#39;s painting of a man with his own head on a platter in front of himself. Dr. Kevorkian put a phrase to it. <em>Man devours himself by seeking the best things in life.</em> This is what the path of darkness is all about, proficiently devouring ourselves, life, consciousness, creation and value for consciousness using deception and coercion to overcome others&#39; free will.</p>

<p>As we come closer toward the infinite goal of treating others the way we would want to be treated, we become more and more like stars. We radiate value outwardly, supporting the free will and persuit of happiness of our whole. We grow the whole, rather than shrinking it. We come toward unity, rather than division, in free will, rather than tyranny. We prefer self-control by love, rather than control of others through fear. We value personal responsibility rather than proficiently shifting the burdens and benefits to parasites. We make a healthy collective organism rather than a spiritually undead corpse animated by the prodding of a self-serving Goa&#39;uld. We can potentially live on forever, while the dark path circles the drain of spiritual entropy.</p>

<p>Spirit is what fuels our minds to animate our bodies and minds. It is created in positive emotions and radiated by negative emotions. This is the resource bullies take from their victims, by causing fear and suffering. This is what these negative ETs want from us basically, aside from using us as tools to do so. This is what negative people steal unknowingly. This is what happens when misery loves company, again, unknowingly. Sadists and torturers like it too. </p>

<p>It&#39;s disgusting, but knowing it exists helps us understand the myths around demons and devils the world over. They steal spiritual energy. Sacrifices make a lot of fear and suffering to allow a lot of energy theft. The dark are spiritual parasites trying to feed and establish more feeding in the future. They are a disease unto the body of God, the multitude of consciousness. Thus, they made the dark pyramid scheme, which reduces the amount they have to work at spiritual energy theft operations, another expressions of the core essence of their way of life, shifting burdens and benefits as parasites.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you examine any early society, it is always the shamans/magicians who control the society. They are not tied to a family, an abstract concept such as a nation or state, or religion. They usually have totemic associations and planetary deity associations. </p>

<p>I&#39;ll expand on the previous line. All religions are esoterically planetary worship. The Christian Archangels are esoterically the planets; Michael is the Sun and Gabriel is the Moon. The Hindu Gods were originally the Navagraha (9 planets). Some of these planets and their aspects are demonized by cults who do not stand for that mode. For instance, Venus if Lucifer or the current Devil because our major religions are primarily anti-patriarchal fertility religions. </p>

<p>One thing is certain: Humans do not control the world. Our vision is too myopic. It&#39;s like saying ants control the universe. Each species is unaware of its sensory and cognitive limitations. We <a href="https://medium.com/@100and9/the-crossroad-between-life-and-death-78df22fce384">disconnect</a> ourselves from other living things for this cognitive bias.</p>

<p>I&#39;d bet you that there are plenty of rulers for different parts of the planet, and they are in agreement with each other to more or less stay out of each others way. </p>

<p>When people talk about Rothchild and other new families I sort of understand why. Human memory generally only extends back a couple of generations, and after that it gets a bit fuzzy.</p>
