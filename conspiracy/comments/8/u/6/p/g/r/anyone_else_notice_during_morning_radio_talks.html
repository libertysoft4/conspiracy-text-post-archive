During their interludes it tells Alexa to play their radio station.  We suspect they are hoping people leave the radio on at home for their pets, and are trying to trick Alexa into playing their station, creating more traffic.  The other aspect I&#39;ve pondered is if they&#39;re trying to feed it advertising as well.  Anyone else notice this?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, I admit you&#39;re dumb, too.</p>

<p>Seriously, Alexa&#39;s are tremendously dumb devices. They only &quot;hear&quot; a handful of syllables that activate them from sleep mode. Then it actively connects to the internet to cloud compute what you are saying. They are so seriously dumb that the device doesn&#39;t even know if it is connected to the internet or not until it wakes up and tries to connect. If the Alexa is surveillance device it is a shittily designed one. </p>

<p>The reason they often act spooky or come on at weird times is because they are only listening for those handfuls of activation syllables. And when it half hears you make an off hand comment it&#39;s voice recognition makes a best guess (usually a bad guess) at giving a relevant response. If Alexas actually had the natural language processing abilities peoe think they have they&#39;d never act weird. They cost 40 bucks for a reason.</p>

<p>Be more worried about the mini laptop you keep in your pocket and tell all your secrets to.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>For radio, this would have no impact on radio stations to have Alexa listening to them without them being home. Radio stations charge advertisement dollars based on their listenership. Their listenership is based solely on a Nielsen survey of a small sample of the listening area, over a very limited time.  Having extra radios playing your station does absolutely nothing. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>As an added benefit, yes. But they can’t quantize the actual number of listeners that those mediums pull in.  So ask yourself, do you really think salespeople in their pitches to clients say, “well, we have a way of turning Alexa’s to our stations therefore we are going to charge you more money”?  Tv stations, on the other hand, would benefit from this if there was a way of making Alexa turn the tv on and to a specific station. </p>

<p>I have a hard time believe they can&#39;t quantify the amount of listeners they have streaming their show.  Also, I think it&#39;s about bolstering their numbers so they can say they have a broader reach in different markets.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>They can, but it makes no difference in advertising revenue. When “Flo’s Diner” wants to run radio ads, they aren’t worried about the person in Latvia that’s listening to the station. That person will never spend money at Flo’s and due to that fact, radio salespeople cannot use that as a reason to get a contract or more money out of a contract. </p>

<p>I used to run radio stations and did so at the turn of the technology age. The biggest reason we used internet radio was so some of our clients were able to listen to us because their metal buildings wouldn’t allow clear, concise waves at all times. These weren’t small time radio stations. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That makes some sense to me, I appreciate the answer. So why would a radio station care if the they&#39;re online if it means no profit and presumably some cost?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Like we had discussed before—added value. There’s nothing about it that you can monetize.  Our cost to be online was about $30. We had all the equipment needed except for something the engineer needed to actually run the line to our server. Just being able to say you’re on I heart radio is some clout. </p>

<p>Want a real good conspiracy about radio?  Look into voice tracking. I could be in a station in Virginia and cut voice tracks for a Colorado station and send them over the net. The Colorado station will play my tracks between songs and it sounds like I’m completely live from Colorado. It’s how radio stations cut their budget. That way you don’t have to deal with on air talent, just purchase a package. If the talent is good enough, the listeners would never know that they aren’t right down the block. </p>

<p>Most likely this, imo they are just trying to &quot;push the meme&quot; of the product so it&#39;s more and more normal to &quot;use&quot; alexa for daily tasks thus subconsciously making people that were somewhat hesitant to buy it actually buy the product. </p>
