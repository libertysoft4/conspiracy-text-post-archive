<p>Are we still required to do SS&#39;s? Been a while. &quot;But the ghosts of 911 will forever haunt the engineering and academic world because nobody, FEMA, ASCE, NIST, AIA, engineering organizations, university scholars and all the kings horses and all the kings men. No one can make a simple experiment that can demonstrate the official force behind the motion.&quot;</p>

<p>They didn&#39;t. NIST admitted to almost freefall speeds when conservation of momentum would have slowed a floor by floor collapse eventually stopping it. Those light floors didn&#39;t crush the whole mass underneath it. It&#39;s impossible.</p>

<p>The video shows a model made of thin paper set on fire &amp; you can&#39;t get it to collapse at those speeds. Massive structural steel &amp; rebarred concrete core isn&#39;t going to vanish suddenly &amp; eliminate the conservation of momentum.</p>

<p>People just need to ignore these dopes making arguments for murderers among the former US executive branch &amp; start making a movement to arrest people while a real investigation is held. </p>

<p>Richard Gage and AE911truth set up their booth at AIA conferences around the country, and the striking thing to me is how few of the architects and structural engineers in attendance have even heard of WTC7 - let alone read the report.</p>

<p>Another good testimony is Peter Ketcham&#39;s who was a NIST scnentist <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GvAv-114bwM">Stand for the Truth: A Government Researcher Speaks Out | 9/11 Evidence and NIST</a>
He actually says that he is embarrassed now that he didn&#39;t look into the WTC issue in more detail years ago. But as soon as he actually started reading the reports, he saw how shoddy and unscientific they were.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Again, just looking at NIST&#39;s faq page:</p>

<blockquote>
<ol>
<li>Did the electrical substation beneath WTC 7 play a role in the fires or collapse?</li>
</ol>

<p>No. There is no evidence that the electric substation contributed to the fires in WTC 7. The electrical substation continued working until 4:33 p.m. on Sept. 11, 2001. Alarms at the substation were monitored, and there were no signals except for one event early in the day. No smoke was observed emanating from the substation.</p>

<p>Special elements of the building&#39;s construction—namely trusses, girders, and cantilever overhangs, which were used to transfer loads from the building superstructure to the columns of the electric substation (over which WTC 7 was constructed) and foundation below—also did not play a significant role in the collapse.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What do you mean by a complicated event?  From a modelling perspective there&#39;s nothing really complicated about this.  There&#39;s an object with a known mass flying into a static structure.  Then there&#39;s a static structure that&#39;s exposed to a known temperature.  What do you think is complicated about the event that would affect the model or experiment?</p>

<p>If a truly weird set of coincidences came together such that only a complicated model could explain this outcome, than you are by definition entering into a very unlikely scenario to have occurred.  The probability that all 3 buildings collapsed is almost infinitely small.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, you can&#39;t cut off the top 20% of a structure and crush the rest of the (undamaged) structure with it. NIST didn&#39;t even attempt to model this they just said that after the collapse initiates &quot;global collapse ensues&quot;. That is not good enough for an event that killed 3000 people.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Don&#39;t let the &quot;debunkers&quot; talk you out of watching this video.</p>

<p>Only 30 minutes of your time explained in a very visual way even a child could understand why US leaders had to have had the World Trade Center towers to wired come down &amp; were the perpetrators of a mass murder against the people of the United States.</p>
