    <div class="md"><p>Haha!  Thank you.  It is worth the read.  </p>

<p>Crowd sourcing intelligence is the way to go.  People will freely share their thoughts, and then they are openly discussed and someone else will share another thought.  There is usually someone who will say something that the others are not thinking about.  </p>

<p>It is a great feeling when I find those gems of information, or I post something that is a gem to someone else.  </p>

<p>Of course, it is frustrating to sort through all the shitty comments, and the &quot;reddit quips&quot; that take up the first 20 or so comments in a thread before I find something that is fucking relevant.  </p>

No one can know whether or not life has meaning, how we interpret that is always going to be based around life experience and personal faith.

    <div class="md"><p>Also as others have alluded to, many lack the ability to switch off so to speak. They are often also mental poking and proding etc and struggle to relax because of it. There is just something different about their minds and the way they are driven. They are often obsessive compulsive too. It&#39;s mentally very draining.</p>

<p>Also many hit a wall in what they are trying to do. Maybe due to lack of resources, or just in trying to break new ground. Many intelligent people dedicate themselves to a singular area and it almost becomes their identity. If they fail then that is often too hard a blow to get up from.</p>

<p>Most people entirely change their profession something like 7 times in their lives if not more. Most geniuses will stay in the same field their whole lives.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Zero autism. Money is easy. Everything is a game. Empathy drops. Medals and recognition are meaningless.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That part especially.</p>

<p>I was bitching about the schools, they absolutely didn&#39;t help.</p>

<p>I too got kicked out of class, spent my time in the Library, computer lab or with buddies on spares. Discovered the wonderful world of Running a gambling ring, dealing drugs and finally extortion. Got expelled for racketeering.</p>

<p>Also easy mode into university and beyond. Retired at 35.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you&#39;re a regular person slogging it from day to day, there&#39;s always <em>hope</em>.  If you fall into despair, there&#39;s always the chance that you&#39;ll meet mr/mrs right, get that job you&#39;ve always wanted, drive that car you&#39;ve dreamed of, win a lottery, etc. and you&#39;ll finally be happy.</p>

<p>If you already have everything you could want and you fall into despair - it doesn&#39;t matter if you&#39;re a successful musician, genius, billionaire, whatever - you don&#39;t have the lifeline that regular people have. You don&#39;t have that hope that with just a little more time you can still turn your life around and make it better because it&#39;s already really, really fucking good.  That&#39;s when people start thinking, &quot;If I&#39;m not happy with my life now, how can I ever be happy?&quot;.  That&#39;s also about the time a towel and a doorknob start looking like a reasonable choice.</p>

They&#39;re smart for not having any kids so that they wont suffer for the mess that we have caused when they grow up. Also smart enough for not getting married, unless they are really lucky to find a life time mate. etc etc etc
Its really unfortunate that some geniuses commits suicide due to depression, stress, anxiety, etc</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I overheard the following from my 6-year-old once: &quot;That&#39;s why they don&#39;t use cats for war. They scatter.&quot;</p>

<p>Geniuses are like cats. Good luck intentionally weaponizing them.</p>

<p>Raising geniuses is really, really, I mean really hard. Dabrowski has a theory of &quot;overexcitabilities&quot; that describes the various personality intensities that often accompany a high IQ. The model is useful in showing why it so hard for high-IQ people to relate. (Your comment elsewhere ITT &quot;imagine everyone you meet is the village idiot&quot; is spot-freaking-on.) OEs are ridiculously challenging to deal with as a parent. Any productivity that you, the (presumably) genius parent of your genius children, may intend or aspire to is subverted into basic parenting energy trying to mold them into decent humans (or super-soldier evil geniuses, depending on your goals). </p>

<p>It takes a village to raise a child. Now couple that with your assertion about the village idiots and imagine where that leads.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Imagine everyone you meet is the villiage idiot. </p>

<p>People talk slooooow, they think slooooow, they rarely have anything interesting to say. Fluff and current events 24/7 at 2 words per minute.</p>

<p>You come up with a new idea filled with mindblowing possibilities and people sit there stunned, blinking at you.</p>

<p>Oh and sometimes, Geniuses are just obnoxious as fuck, being told you&#39;re a superman for most of your life has that effect. They usually have fairly weak social skills partly as a result of this. They&#39;re also fairly autistic which doesn&#39;t help. People start talking to them, the conversation gets going people get lost, confused and/or intimidated, communication gives way to awkward silence.</p>

<p>Oh fuck me, almost forgot the &quot;Here&#39;s my IQ, what&#39;s yours?&quot; pissing contest, that never EVER gets stale. Seriously, on the count of 3 shout your IQ and let&#39;s fucking move on please.</p>

<p>They&#39;re rarely actually challenged. When they face a decent challenge, most of them have no tools to deal with it. Their ideas and beliefs haven&#39;t been field tested which leads to false positives and shitty ideas, because nobody could tell them no with any kind of metal muscle.</p>

<p>They often lack common sense, I know a fairly disproportionate number of them, and Man alive, can they be some of the dumbest fucks on the planet sometimes. &quot;Here&#39;s a unified field theory I came up with on the toilet&quot;, &quot;Did you remember to wipe your ass?&quot; &quot;......Yeah, sure did, be right back&quot;</p>

<p>Meaning is  subjective. </p>

<p>I believe the meaning of life is to observe the universe around us, random probability particles kinda lend themseves to this thought. Basically you&#39;re meant to be the audience to nature&#39;s great show. </p>

<p>That&#39;s pretty much it. </p>

There is more to be sought, to be conquered, to bring into the fold. This is the folly of such, for all things must have an end, an end to growth, a sense of satisfaction with what is (not what could be). Many highly intelligent people do not get the memo until late, and trying to include such am absolute idea in a system that doesn&#39;t already have space for it can be a lot. Rather pity such moments, because immortality of ideas is the same as other immortalities; non. Hemingway, Van Gogh, or George Price came to such and it was too much. Take time with your life, because I think much of that is the difference, knowing yourself, the smaller parts of your world, and making some minir peace for a time. </p>
