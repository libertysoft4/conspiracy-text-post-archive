Those things look extremely suspect. Also on the bottom of the tower there was a vent like generator releasing some type of exhaust. The sound was exactly like the sound microwaves make while active but on a much higher scale. It was like it was releasing the excess energy of the system. Just got total bad vibes around the whole thing.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There was an informative video on YouTube about this that I would&#39;ve linked to if it hadn&#39;t been fucking removed. The fact that it was removed tells me a lot. </p>

<p>For those not sure what Pete is talking about,  the electrical conductors for some of those towers have been vastly oversized, meaning that the microwave emitters on top are capable of being supplied with far more electrical energy than needed for communications, essentially  turning the tower into an area-of-effect weapon which can fry anything within it&#39;s radius. </p>

<p>The installation of 5G emitters nationwide will theoretically allow the network of emitters to be used as a weapon as well,  with the added benefit of being able to form a microwave &quot;beam&quot; and train it upon specific targets. </p>

<p>I think this was built into our communications infrastructure as a defense against possible invasion or incurable civil unrest. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You know those mysterious  towers they erected in NYC at all the tunnels and bridges?</p>

<p>I may just be paranoid, but,  when I look at images of the towers taken during their construction, I see what I think are three emitter arrays,  one in each horizontal band  which was later covered  with a solid white panel.  Each little dot would be a small emitter, the hundreds of emitters collectively forming an array which could generate a steerable beam.  Please note that those little dots go all the way around the oval shaped tower which is forming a curved surface with no corners, indicating a beam could be swung in any direction if need be. </p>

<p>How could you say this after seeing the pictures on the website? They are identical to the panels seen all over. Not only that but they also show various models that are curved and those too match up completely to the ones seen on towers/buildings/etc. I am as skeptic as they come but that manufacturer link really pushed me over the fence on this. Prior to seeing that, I had my doubts but now, I&#39;m like 97% sure those things all over my city are microwave transmitters. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thank you for that very specific information and the pic.  It is nice to know how this system differs from a regular electrical system; I wasn&#39;t aware that this type of cable was used in the towers. I&#39;ve previously looked for diagrams or illustrations for students detailing how cell towers work and can&#39;t find anything.... Do you have a link for what I&#39;m looking for?  I want to understand fully how the system works but have not been able to piece it together. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, I don&#39;t work in that exact area. I work in something similar.  So I can handwave a little and explain it like this:  Did you ever play with a walkie talkie as a kid?  You have a radio and the other guy has a radio and you talk and you listen, one at a time. This is called simplex communication. We are going to talk about duplex communication, which would allow both of the users to talk and listen at the same time. Only imagine that the other guy is standing on a tower and he is passing his information down a telephone line.</p>

<p>There are some big pieces:</p>

<p>You need equipment on the ground. This would be the signal amplifiers and the receivers and the equipment to interconnect the cell tower to the &quot;telephone company&quot;.  What we would call land lines, which are actually fiber optic connections to the telco/internet backbone.  There might be other equipment on the ground, such as a backup generator and fuel tanks, a battery backup (UPS) and maybe air conditioning if the equipment is in a standalone building.  Depending on how they lay the site out, you might have equipment on the ground in several weatherproof racks or in a small building.</p>

<p>Next, you need a pole to hold up your equipment in the sky.  This tower, typically a steel monopole, doesn&#39;t actually do anything. It is completely inert.  It&#39;s just a place to hang stuff up.  There might be a horizontal run of cabling between the building and the tower.  We call this the ice bridge.  This bridge protects the cables from falling ice, which is actually a pretty big hazard in the winter on a tall tower.</p>

<p>Hanging on the tower will be the antennas.  These are the active elements that send out transmissions to your phone, and also receive signals from your phone at the same time.  They use the same set of antennas to do this, through a tricky piece of equipment called a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duplexer">duplexer.</a>  Usually what happens is that the phone might be transmitting a signal to the tower on channel A and listening for the incoming signal on channel B at the same time.  Since they are on different frequencies, you can send and receive simultaneously without one signal interfering with the other one.  The tower does the opposite: it&#39;s outgoing signal is transmitted on channel B and it listens for an incoming signal on channel A.  In real life, it&#39;s a lot more complicated than this, because the tower might have 100 different calls and 200 data signals going in and out of it at the same time.  But this example is sufficient to give you an overview.</p>

<p>The interesting thing about cell towers is how little radiation they actually put off.  The tower workers have a &quot;standoff distance&quot;, the distance they can safely be close to an actively transmitting antenna.  Some of these you are allowed to be as little as 3 feet away from, all day long.  They put out about as much energy as a few light bulbs, just on a different frequency.</p>

<p>There are multiple panel antennas on a tower because they are directional.  Cell phones operate on UHF frequencies, which means you pretty much have to have &quot;line-of-sight&quot; to the tower.  Trees and buildings notwithstanding, if you can see a tower, you can talk to the tower. If it&#39;s over the horizon or behind a hill or if you&#39;re in a tunnel, you can&#39;t get a signal.  (Sometimes they put repeaters in highway tunnels, or use directional antenna arrays to shoot a signal as deep into a tunnel as they can, so your signal doesn&#39;t drop out when you drive through it.)</p>

<p>Usually the top structure on the cell tower is triangular, with antennas pointing in three major directions.  This is because the desired layout of the cells is an array that looks like a hexagon on the map.  Where the lines converge is where you put a tower.  They are usually located as high as possible on a hill or a building or a water tower (or lately on a telephone pole as a micro-cell) so that they can get the best coverage area.</p>

<p>Sometimes you&#39;ll see multiple layers of antennas on a tower. This is probably a shared tower with several companies or data services using the same structure to save on real estate. Sometimes they are forced to do this because of the &quot;not in my backyard&quot; syndrome where cities (or people) do not want cell towers being built excessively.  People think that they are an eyesore so they don&#39;t want them around, while simultaneously asking for higher speeds and better coverage.  (People are dumb.)</p>

<p>I didn&#39;t touch on the feedlines connecting the antennas and the equipment down on the ground. You saw my earlier example.  If you look at the back of your TV set, you might have a round coax cable coming in from an antenna on your roof or from a cable TV company or satellite.  This coax cable is a good example of what we just looked at in the above example.  There is a sheath on the outside of the cable that protects it from being chafed or damaged, and keeps water out.  There is an outer braid of fine wire that acts both as a ground and a shield.  Then there is a layer of insulating material. In a cable TV application (RG6 Quad Shield) this material might be a low density foam that is also waterproof.  In my example above, you saw both foam and also something that looks like a spiral spacer. This is made out of teflon. We call this &quot;air line&quot; as opposed to &quot;foam line&quot;.  This type of line is pressurized with either nitrogen (from a welding tank) or dry pressurized air (from a dehydrator compressor). It&#39;s very important to keep the inside of the cable dry. This prevents corrosion and arcing.  The dry air or nitrogen keeps any leaks from allowing water into the space.  The teflon spiral spacer just keeps the center conductor from touching the outer shield.  The center conductor can either be a tiny copper wire, in the cable TV example, or it could be a big piece of flexible copper in the cell phone example. This is the thing that actually carries the signal.  It&#39;s RF (radio frequency) energy.  It uses the skin effect, so the actual thickness of the copper is pretty irrelevant.  The diameter of the center conductor and the outer conductor are critical; this affects the efficiency of the signal going up and down the cable as well as several other boring parameters that I&#39;m not going to go into.  That&#39;s why they appear to be so large. You think they are carrying huge amounts of energy but they are really mostly empty space.</p>

<p>Now you will notice that I didn&#39;t mention anything about how a phone call connects to the backbone or what the cell company does about a data connection or text messaging. That&#39;s because I don&#39;t know about how that all works. I work on the equipment, not on the software side.  I also can&#39;t tell you much about the upcoming 5G, because that&#39;s not my area of expertise. Suffice it to say, it will bring faster internet to your phone.  I have no idea how.</p>

<p>You&#39;re right, it&#39;s difficult to find information on this type of thing.  If it wasn&#39;t, people probably wouldn&#39;t have as many conspiracy theories about it. The big part about it is that the RF signal is invisible and acts like magic, so people are naturally suspicious.  It&#39;s mostly mundane.</p>

<p>(If you know an old ham radio operator, he would probably be glad to sketch some of this up for you.  The systems are similar enough that he&#39;d be able to figure out the parts that he doesn&#39;t know.)</p>

<p>With no journalists left in the united states, there is no one left who could investigate what these are and why they are ubiquitous, ie who is paying for them and most importantly who controls them and from where.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Cell Phone Towers are <em>perception inhibitors</em> ; They are designed to lobotomize its surrounding area. Also the 5G Wi fi coming online has the ability to alter your perceptions and behaviour to an extreme level. Its going to be horrific.</p>

<p>Edinburgh in Scotland has this problem every summer when Elizabeth II takes up residency of Holyrood Palace. Locals get a dose of <em>HAARP</em> to alter their feelings towards Elizabeth II (aka brainwashing) and to make her appear <em>human</em> for short periods of time in public.</p>

<p>The only way to avoid this is move out of big cities and live without the use of smartphones and laptops.</p>
