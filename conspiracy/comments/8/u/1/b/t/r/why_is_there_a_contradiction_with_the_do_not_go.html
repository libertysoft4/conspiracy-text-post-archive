    <div class="md"><p>Who the fuck claimed any of that? You just took the word battery and just thought The Matrix as if it was the first piece of media to put it in those terms. Shows how easily you are manipulated, thinking the movies &quot;come first&quot; then the theories rather than the movies being made precisely because mental giants like you will think everything that happens in a Hollywood movie is immediately just a story.</p>

<p>If I wanted to make you NOT believe in some ancient secret, I sure as fuck would make a big budget Hollywood movie about it so cattle like you would think it&#39;s just a movie concept.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>2Co_11:14  And no marvel; for Satan himself is transformed into an angel of light. </p>

<p>The entire New Age system is a false light.  It&#39;s all Satanic and meant to get you to die sin your sins without the imputed righteousness of Jesus Christ which is the only thing that can save you.  Nothing you do in this life can save you.  Only what God himself did for you in the flesh of Jesus Christ.  Repent and believe this to be saved:</p>

<p>1Co 15:1  Moreover, brethren, I declare unto you the gospel which I preached unto you, which also ye have received, and wherein ye stand; </p>

<p>1Co 15:2  By which also ye are saved, if ye keep in memory what I preached unto you, unless ye have believed in vain. </p>

<p>1Co 15:3  For I delivered unto you first of all that which I also received, how that Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures; </p>

<p>1Co 15:4  And that he was buried, and that he rose again the third day according to the scriptures: </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m 100&amp;#37; sure it&#39;s right otherwise I wouldn&#39;t even bother to tell anyone.</p>

<p>Rom_3:23  For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God;</p>

<p>Isa_64:6  But we are all as an unclean thing, and all our righteousnesses are as filthy rags; and we all do fade as a leaf; and our iniquities, like the wind, have taken us away.</p>

<p>Rev 21:8  But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone: which is the second death.</p>

<p>The only way to avoid the second death is to have the imputed righteousness of Jesus Christ via repentance and belief in the above gospel.  God isn&#39;t playing around.  He&#39;s as disgusted by a single lie as we are by a child molesting murdering pedophile.  He has no problem pushing sin with eternal torments just like we have no problem punishing child molesting murderers.  We like to compare ourselves to each other and not to a perfect holy God who can&#39;t tolerate any sin at all.</p>

<p>Pro 1:22  How long, ye simple ones, will ye love simplicity? and the scorners delight in their scorning, and fools hate knowledge? </p>

<p>Pro 1:23  Turn you at my reproof: behold, I will pour out my spirit unto you, I will make known my words unto you. </p>

<p>Pro 1:24  Because I have called, and ye refused; I have stretched out my hand, and no man regarded; </p>

<p>Pro 1:25  But ye have set at nought all my counsel, and would none of my reproof: </p>

<p>Pro 1:26  I also will laugh at your calamity; I will mock when your fear cometh; </p>

<p>Pro 1:27  When your fear cometh as desolation, and your destruction cometh as a whirlwind; when distress and anguish cometh upon you. </p>

<p>Pro 1:28  Then shall they call upon me, but I will not answer; they shall seek me early, but they shall not find me: </p>

<p>Pro 1:29  For that they hated knowledge, and did not choose the fear of the LORD: </p>

<p>Pro 1:30  They would none of my counsel: they despised all my reproof. </p>

<p>Pro 1:31  Therefore shall they eat of the fruit of their own way, and be filled with their own devices. </p>

<p>Pro 1:32  For the turning away of the simple shall slay them, and the prosperity of fools shall destroy them. </p>

<p>Pro 1:33  But whoso hearkeneth unto me shall dwell safely, and shall be quiet from fear of evil. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s why it&#39;s called &quot;witnessing.&quot;  Those of us who have gone through the quickening of the spirit and the transformation of the mind though Jesus Christ bear witness to you.  I&#39;m sure I&#39;m not the first nor the last that will.  If your flesh dies before you repent, God will go over every moment of your life that he reached out to you by any means (nature, thought, witnesses, etc) and show you have you willfully rejected his grace and forgiveness.</p>

<p>Rom 1:20  For the invisible things of him from the creation of the world are clearly seen, being understood by the things that are made, even his eternal power and Godhead; so that they are without excuse: 
Rom 1:21  Because that, when they knew God, they glorified him not as God, neither were thankful; but became vain in their imaginations, and their foolish heart was darkened. 
Rom 1:22  Professing themselves to be wise, they became fools, </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Agreed.  That&#39;s why all the religions of the world, even the fake ones that claim Christianity tell you what you must do to attain salvation.  The truth is there is nothing you must do and in fact nothing you can do.  It&#39;s already been done for you by God himself who came in the flesh of Jesus Christ.  Your common refrain response is due to all the straw man false religions that are stood up for you to knock down.</p>

<p>The idea that God waits a few hundred thousand years before sending down his message is pretty retarded. You can&#39;t cite a book written by Shephards two thousand years ago as proof of anything. </p>
