<p>The world is going to want it. </p>

<p>We need to get there first. </p>

<p>Otherwise, I think it’s pretty cool that with the immense amount of traffic currently in space, and the large amount more traffic surely to come soon enough, we could possibly be the first “traffic control” if you will, for space. We could help dictate who and what (ships, satellites, etc.) goes where. Not in the sense of “owning” space itself, but for reasons like safety of the occupants of these flights, or safety of multi-million dollar research satellites. We could be the first humans to organize space traffic control in our galaxy. Pretty cool. </p>

Space Force can recruit or contract the technology leaders and innovators using the practically limitless budget of the department of defense and, of course, weaponize progress already made by non-military contractors.   If we can be the first to weaponize space and in the process employ millions of people and funnel billions of dollars into research and development, I&#39;m all for it.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>First, I shared details with documentation from an Air Force sponsored book that the Space Force--under that exact title--was created in the 1980&#39;s.  Why the talk about that it is something new to most of the public and evidently most news agencies.  I assume this recent spate of info and disinfo is a disinformation ploy to muddy the whole event of us getting into space militarily long ago under the lingering remnants of the much broken Space Treaty that about all nations signed back in the 1960&#39;s.</p>

<p>I see this new talk about the Space Force is because it is part of a program that we have had for decades.  Before the existence of the triangles in our skies, some of us wondered if the Space Force was anything more than an empty promise that Reagan&#39;s efforts with the Space Defense Initiative failed to complete.  But then the began being reported around the US.  So, duh!  One and one makes two.   </p>

<p>The currently created buzz about the Space Force is simply a delayed revelation to the public and the triangles are witnessed to back up that claim.  Before we get an official type of Disclosure about ETs, I think we are seeing the manner in which it will be announced fairly shortly that the triangles are real and our devices.</p>

<p>That will eventually lead to the question being asked if they came from UFO technology and, thus, we sidle into the UFO question in a safe, side way with the most critical information about all of the questions about the ETs coming later in degrees &quot;after studies are done,&quot; etc.  </p>

<p>Regardless, anything that relates in some way to the UFOs is not going to be handed to you straight across the table. </p>
