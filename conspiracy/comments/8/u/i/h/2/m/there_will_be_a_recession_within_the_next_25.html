    <div class="md"><p>They are engineered to consolidate and monopolize wealth for the largest banks and corporations.  During 2008 depression it was the smaller banks and businesses that faultered and closed-despite not taking the risks the &quot;too big to fail or jail&quot; banks did which contributed to the recession.  The TBTF banks extorted bailout money and grew larger to control even more of the market.   Most of these same banks were around-Goldman, Wells Fargo, Citi, BOA etc. And used the same tactics during the Great Depression.</p>

stash. Don&#39;t forget seasonings sauces. Beans and rice taste way better with a dash of soy sauce and hot sauce. Salt cured ham can also be kept for quite a while. You also need water or a means to access  extract and filter a water source </p>

<p>Here&#39;s the best description we found (from Dietriffic.com) : “The taste and texture of quinoa is a bit like brown rice crossed with oatmeal. It&#39;s fluffy, creamy, crunchy and somewhat nutty, all rolled into one.” It&#39;s versatile and can be prepared several ways. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Found that description on google. You have to rinse it first (it has a bitter and slightly toxic coating of saponin which quinoa adapted to deter birds from eating it), so just buy pre-rinsed stuff and it&#39;ll taste great, and be great for you. It is also gluten free, so if you have any celiac survivors with you, you&#39;re covered. It is on the low end of the glycemic index as well that means  that you don&#39;t have to worry about diabetic concerns, either. It can be prepared in as many or more ways as rice. Of course, if you want to know if it&#39;ll work for you, just buy and prepare some. It has an earthier flavor than rice, but that can be a strength. Black beans in particular go quite well with it.</p>

<p>What are you even arguing about at this point?</p>

<p>It was &quot;within&quot; 2.5. years that a recession may occur.  That&#39;s inclusive of today, tomorrow, etc., </p>

<p>Sixty days is the time frame for finding work (an entirely different concern).</p>

<p>2)  In order to prepare for that recession, again <strong>within</strong> 2.5 years it would be a good idea to stock some canned goods and a couple of months rent.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Educate yourself about &quot;productive powers of labor&quot;. 2010 article, still very relevant today:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.larouchepub.com/other/2010/3748hamilton_constitution.html">A Matter of Principle: Alexander Hamilton&#39;s Economics Created Our Constitution</a></p>

<p>Contrary to the views of nearly all economic experts, there is a simple reality which <strong>thinking Americans</strong> must face in the midst of this unprecedented breakdown of the financial and physical economy: First, that the key to reversing this global crisis, which threatens civilization itself, can be found in the principle behind the economic measures of America&#39;s first Treasury Secretary, Alexander Hamilton. Second, that that principle is firmly embedded in the U.S. Constitution itself.</p>

<p>There will be those who yell and scream about this assertion. Both Wall Street financiers and unwashed populists will insist that Hamilton was an elitist who copied the British System, and that his institution of national banking and government promotion of manufactures and internal improvements was a violation of the free-trade system which has supposedly been responsible for our prosperity as a nation. But, they lie. For Hamilton was the intellectual author of the U.S. Constitution itself, and its unique principle of using a credit system, based on national sovereignty, to foster capital formation for technological progress.</p>

<p>Hamilton&#39;s genius in economics was evident from almost immediately after he came to America&#39;s shores in 1772. By 1774, he was already writing anti-British tracts which contained the germ of the concept of national physical economy, in which he asserted that the development of the nation was dependent upon the promotion of agriculture and manufactures together. As he developed his ideas later, especially in his three famous government Reports—two on Public Credit, and one on Manufactures—Hamilton asserted clearly that <strong>the chief driver for economic development was the inventiveness, or power of the human mind, which expressed itself through the increase in the use of &quot;artificial labor&quot; (i.e., machinery), and was enhanced by the development of infrastructure</strong>. This concept he summarized as the &quot;productive powers of labor.&quot;</p>

<p>This intellectual foundation, which stands in the sharpest contrast to the bestial &quot;free-trade&quot; ideas of Adam Smith, was strongly informed by the political-economic ideas of the great German scientist Gottfried Leibniz, especially as they were expressed in the works of one of Leibniz&#39;s sponsors, French Finance Minister Jean-Baptiste Colbert, and the Swiss promoter of Leibniz, Emerich Vattel.</p>

<p>Hamilton, and his collaborators, most emphatically including Benjamin Franklin and George Washington, faced an enormous struggle to establish the institutions which would permit the realization of their vision of human progress. Faced with British determination to suppress any such development, they knew they had to fight not only for independence politically, but to establish institutions that would support such independence and economic growth. The result was the U.S. Constitution, which embodies the principle of the credit system, as well as its necessary complements—the National Bank and the manufacturing policy which, although defeated in the short term, eventually took off under the presidencies of John Quincy Adams, Abraham Lincoln, William McKinley, and Franklin Delano Roosevelt.</p>

<p>Today, ignoramuses and Tories rave against an activist government, and can&#39;t tell the difference between debt incurred by speculation, and credit issued for long-term capital development. They claim our Constitution calls for giving free reign to the markets, and that the &quot;government that governs least governs best.&quot; Their ideas, like those of the political forces in the United States who opposed Hamilton and his collaborators in the 1780s and &#39;90s, serve none other than the British Empire, although today that empire functions as a financial system, not a colonial system policed by a massive army and navy. Thus, we have reached the point where patriots have no choice but to master the principle of Alexander Hamilton, now!</p>

<p>and if you would have not touched them you would have recovered plus even more gains on top of that. You are thinking of stocks the wrong way. Over time...they all go up. That&#39;s just what happens. Yes there are dips, but you want your money to make money, not sit under the mattress. </p>

<p>When you enter into the stock market, you are buying shares (not always but go with me here). No matter if the market dips, the number of shares you own will never change. You may lose money on paper, and a lot of people have realized losses because they panic sell. Wait it out. Time is always your friend with the market. That&#39;s why as you get older your portfolio should shift more towards bonds over stocks....more stable because you have less time left. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you have capital to invest during a recession, you can make out like  a mother fucking bandit. In this situation we are assuming that we are going to be in a recession in 2.5 years (i.e. we know a recession is coming). Since this is the case, we must also assume that liquidating your assets in preparation for the recession which you <strong>know</strong> is coming is sound advise, because then you have a whole bunch of capital to put into the market and turn yourself into a multi-millionaire.</p>

<p>This is a hypothetical scenario in which you know for a fact, there is about to be a recession. That&#39;s impossible to know, best you&#39;ve got is a guess. It&#39;s objectively true that if you have capital during a recession you can make a fuck ton of money.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Just save money and prepare yourself to take advantage of the recession. It may only last a couple of months and not be all that bad though. People see the word recession now and think that means we will have a 2008 all over again. That hadn&#39;t happened since the Great Depression and more than likely won&#39;t happen again in our lifetime. There will be a bloodbath in the stock market on some overvalued giants, which is usually what happens and then the market will correct itself. If you have positioned yourself correctly, you will make some money. Just always go by Warren Buffett&#39;s investing advice.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Realistically, it&#39;s a recession, not a fucking apocalypse. If it&#39;s like the tech bubble or the 07-08 recession you&#39;re not going to need guns and 6 months of canned goods to survive.</p>

<p>Pay off debt. Save as much cash as possible. Consider moving money in your 401k / IRA out of stocks (maybe not quite yet, my rule is to move out when the market drops below the 12 month simple moving average (SMA), which we are close to, but not quite there).</p>

<p>From a practical stand point, if you lose your job, get a new one ASAP. Even if it pays much less wage, keep a flow of income.</p>

<p>Just be prepared to be frugal and after 12-18 months throw your money back in the market when it goes back above the 12 SMA. And then maybe buy property while it&#39;s cheap if you need a home. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The biggest thing about 2008 was people losing their jobs. No jobs, no way to pay rent, car payments, mortgages, etc. Rule #1 of the collapse: PAY OFF DEBT NOW. Or better yet, don&#39;t get into it.</p>

<p>Second, get together 6+ months of living expenses. Rent, mortgage, utilities, food. In the short term, you might just be living off this. A smaller percentage in 2008 were hit super hard and resorted to living on what they had for a time.</p>

<p>Third, post-6 months, into years timeline. Having additional food is handy. Less you have to spend later. Might be good if it gets into the &quot;SHTF&quot; scenarios everyone dreams up. Way down on the list, firearms, flashlights, stored water, etc. As always, focus on this last. We&#39;re probably not going to get into this area, but I&#39;d rather be safe than sorry.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No doubt our economy is predicated on somewhat predictable boom and bust cycles. Profiteers know when to shift their money and win big whether boom or bust. Bit I think our current boom will grow to be much bigger and more sustained. Upswings usually lasts a good 8-10 years if you look at history, and the recession didnt end until 2012, so we still have a ways to go before another downturn. And keep in mind our last bust was statistically second to only the great depression. I think we&#39;ll have a longer and more intense boom than usual which will last roughly to 2022-24, with a moderate sustained constriction thereafter, of course this is precluding any major disaster or war. But the sun keeps rising, the world keeps spinning, and money keeps spending. THere is more of it in the US economy than ever before and it the whole thing is dependent on consumer spending. More money for people = more money for corporations and vice versa. We&#39;ll probably see one of the largest economic expansions in a generation, followed by a moderate corrective contraction shortly thereafter. Depression part 2 is nowhere in sight, in my opinion. But things can change rapidly in the face of unforeseen catalyzing events.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re right and it could be a 0.3% decline within the next 1-4 years. Most of these were the result of major political events, sudden and dramatic changes in policy, or corrupt, even illegal economic behavior, probably because recessions are largely the result of psychology. Belief controls economic success. Faith in institutions, corporations, governments etc.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>See a lot of moving money away from the stock market as advice here.  Always been more of a fan of dollar cost averaging and having a smaller percentage of my funds in equities than most models recommend for my age and much less so of trying to &quot;time&quot; the market.  I just assume the money I have in the market is there for the long haul and I adjust it down as I move toward retirement age rather than pulling it out and putting it back in every few years trying to predict downturns.  I&#39;m pretty conservative though - usually no more than 50% in equities and the rest split between bonds and cash.  No right answer, I know.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So if I look at your &quot;time since previous recession&quot; column, there really isn&#39;t a pattern. The time period ranges anywhere from 1 year to 10 years. You may say that a recession happens every 1-10 years, but that&#39;s a pretty board scope. Also, your upper limit for your 2.5 exceeds the maximum range of the highest gap between recessions, consideirng that we are at 9 years since the previous one.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If it&#39;s a pattern then why is it going over 10 years since the last recession in 2008? That&#39;s never happened. Most have occurred within the business cycle which is every 7 years. There is only one other time in history where the economy didn&#39;t hit recession until the 10th year after the precious. You can wiki the dates too. Also, I didn&#39;t know we ever really came out of the last recession, some say we never had a recovery.  So what pattern are taking about?</p>

<p>we&#39;re over due for our scheduled recession </p>

<p>That&#39;s because the government has been semi competent in stimulating the economy. </p>

<p>Bush&#39;s low earner tax rebate softened it - the housing crisis recession would have been significantly worse without it. Obama did a marginally better job, with policies like cash for clunkers, some green energy rebates and things for commuting. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>we are soooo overdue to a recession. The cycle should&#39;ve busted in 2015/16 (commodities crash) and within the 7 year crash cycles. A small correction occured later on, but we are back to record highs. </p>

<p>Of course because of QE, ZIRP, and all the other financially wizardry being done nothing happened (well developing markets crashed, but nothing global).</p>

<p>the crypto currency boom and ongoing unicorn startups are perfect example of how the market is overextended.</p>

<p>Some thought (myself included) that Trump would usher a crash (ie market correction), in his first year (&quot;I&#39;m the king of bankruptcies, and we ar bankrupt&quot;). </p>

<p>Yet here we are, overheated, overextended, and with many of her safeguards imposed post-great recession discarded. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Why do you say 2.5 years? I&#39;ve been anticipating one for the last 2.5 . This is the longest run without one since the Great Depression. I feel the next one will make the GD look feeble. There&#39;s no room for stimulus as rates can&#39;t go any lower and M1 is so high already. Not to mention all the safeguard regulations imposed on Wall Street after the Great Recession of &#39;08
have been either dismantled or weakened sufficiently to be ineffective. The next one could be a complete collapse that even the Fed and their minions can&#39;t weasel their way out of with our money.</p>

<p>This is a hypothetical scenario in which you know for a fact, there is about to be a recession. That&#39;s impossible to know, best you&#39;ve got is a guess. It&#39;s objectively true that if you have capital during a recession you can make a fuck ton of money.</p>

One of my focal points is flavor. If shit hits the fan a good tasting meal will be one of the most luxurious things one could hope for aside from survival and access to modern medicine. Don&#39;t forget household products too. Extra toilet paper hurts nothing if you have the space as well as dental products and extra soap</p>
