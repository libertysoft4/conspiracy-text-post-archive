<p>Bans thrown out to tons of people participating or questioning the mods.</p>

<p>I live 10 minutes from where they found it. Latest update from a woman that was just up there:</p>

<p>&quot;</p>

<p>I wanted to write a post and outline a few things regarding the camp that was discovered earlier this week.</p>

<p>If you have further interest in what is going on, please like the page for VOP as they are updating often.</p>

<p>I know many of you are concerned about the safety of going down there and I can only say that these are trained veterans that all made it back from deployments to “the sandbox” they protected our lives over there and now they are protecting us here.Never once was I scared. We are actually here now.</p>

<p>VOP’s motto is “God’s got my six”</p>

<p>They are straight down the middle Patriots that are not militia, not radical anything (not radical left, not radical right not radical religious).Many of them have only had a few hours sleep the past 6 days and they are still very passionate about protecting children.....all children.</p>

<p>They happened upon this camp while out searching for homeless vets that may need some help or services.</p>

<p>They were deeply concerned and called in others that have expertise in this area. Experts have confirmed that this is a child sex trafficking camp.</p>

<p>Craig Sawyer and his team areExperts at this and they have been down here and have confirmed that this is undeniably a child sex trafficking camp.Mark and I have been down here and I know nothing about sex trafficking camps and I don’t WANT to believe it, but yet it’s undeniable. I have seen quite a few homeless camps and this is altogether different.</p>

<p>VOP happened on this camp and tried for 3 days to get officials down here to gather evidence.I asked what we could tell you and they said:They are not tampering with evidence.The most critical or damning evidence has been collected and taken out per protocol, by VOP.</p>

<p>New evidence was just found and everyone is wearing gloves.</p>

<p>If the FBI and Homeland security wont come down and take all of this evidence then Thank the Lord these guys are. They are finding items that could lead to missing children.They have found log books, blueprints, drop books.Do you know that a child is worth $100k or more? And can be sold over and over and over again.</p>

<p>Please pray for these guys.That’s all I can say.</p>

<p>The police have now blocked the gate access and arrested 2 volunteers who were at the gate but on public property.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>As I&#39;ve said multiple times they&#39;ve contacted the owners of the site and they don&#39;t appear to have anything to do with the guy who threatened them, at least one of which was a guy on horseback who came off of the nearby reservation. This looks exactly like many of the other camps they routinely find along the border that coyotes use to traffic people and drugs, and the women and kids who come across are routinely sexually abused. They are extremely commonplace. Don&#39;t act like this is some outlandish conspiracy that they stumbled across one of them. The suspicious part is how the local sheriff and police, who, living alongside this stuff should be familiar with it&#39;s frequency, is trying to write it off like it&#39;s nothing when these things are a notorious problem with coyotes, cartels and our southern border. </p>

<p>Worth pointing out. It’s crazy that Reddit isn’t required to put a disclaimer about that or something. I may not agree with everything they stand for over there, but I can recognize unfair treatment when I see it, and the way that community has been treated is just downright wrong.</p>

<p>Private companies can do whatever they want, sure. But they should be required to disclose practices like selective censorship.</p>

<p>this is also a lie.  you keep the sub because removing it would be a huge red flag to the average Reddit user (most dont care about politics and removing the only pro trump sub would get those users curious)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You just made my point. While I admit it&#39;s certainly possible, I don&#39;t see anything convincing in any of the articles about this. Straps on trees? That&#39;s it? A homeless camp is going to provide so many pieces of &quot;evidence&quot; that you could make it sound like anything happened there. Instead of jumping in, making a mess, seizing &quot;evidence&quot; and blabbing about it on the internet,, I would talk to authorities quietly to arrange an investigation. OR, if you didn&#39;t trust the authorities, hire a Private Investigator. Make some progress on finding stronger evidence. This reeks of loose cannon misdirection. The only mystery is whether or not it&#39;s intentional. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, Trump is from a different faction.</p>

<p>(It&#39;s why the CIA-controlled media is going batshit insane after he got into the Presidency.)</p>

<p>It wasn&#39;t supposed to happen.</p>

<p>Realize: There is a difference between The Shadow Government and the Deep State.</p>

<p>People use them as synonyms, but they&#39;re not.</p>

<p>The two factions are currently at war.</p>

<p>Trump was most likely recruited by the generals, who are staging a counter-coup against the Shadow Government.</p>

<p>If you&#39;ll allow for a gross oversimplification, it&#39;s the CIA versus the Military Industrial-Complex.</p>

<p>Hillary represented the CIA. (Her husband Bill got entangled with it during the days of Iran-Contra when George Bush, Sr. was running cocaine up from Central America using MS-13. One of the hubs for the operation was Mean, Arkansas, when Bill Clinton was then-governor. After he stumbled upon the covert op, he was enlisted to join up and promised the presidency if he played ball. Watch a reporter question Clinton about it back in the 1990s: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iDMktUYvC7k">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iDMktUYvC7k</a></p>

<p>Long story short, the Clintons and Bushes are tied into the CIA drug-running operation . . . with the Bushes being in it almost as early as the Delanos and Forbes&#39; (through Prescott Bush). </p>

<p>Prescott Bush was one of the earliest architects of the CIA, and his son (George, Sr.) would later be made head of the CIA in the 1970s.</p>

<p>But George had been running operations for them since the 1950s.</p>

<p>Okay, that&#39;s &quot;The Shadow Government&quot;.</p>

<p>The <em>Deep State,</em> by contrast, was started by a man named Vannevar Bush in the 1930s. He was the head of MIT, and the first man to make the case that the U.S. should maintain a war-time footing even in times of peace, and that they should fund science to help the military. Vannevar Bush [no relation to George Bush, by the way] was the founder of military contractor Raytheon.</p>

<p>When Nikola Tesla died, the government sent in Vannevar Bush&#39;s protege from MIT . . . a man by the name of John Trump.</p>

<p>John Trump is the uncle of Donald Trump.</p>

<p>John Trump was there, at the ground floor, of the creation of what we today know as the &quot;Military Industrial Complex&quot;.</p>

<p>(To read more about Vannevar Bush and Trump, check out &quot;Endless Frontier,&quot; by G. Pascal Zachary.)</p>

<p>Journalist Daniel Liszt recently did a series of presentations on Trump and his connection to Vannevar Bush and the Deep State. See here: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpzmNSaF47Y&amp;amp;t=6258s">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpzmNSaF47Y&amp;amp;t=6258s</a></p>

<p>In summation, what we&#39;re watching now is a civil war between the CIA [which is losing power] and the Military Industrial Complex [which is engaging in a putsch to recover control of the U.S. government from the CIA]. </p>

<p>Trump is NOT on the Clintons&#39; and Bushes&#39; side. Their mortal enemies. Which is why, in the last election, Bush, Sr. voted for Hillary. Barbara Bush, by the way, said that Bill was so close to the Bush family that she considered him one of her sons. These dynasties are tight.</p>

<p>And Trump pissed them both off. </p>

<p>He&#39;s playing a very dangerous game. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, Obama is a weird case.</p>

<p>He was allowed to cut in line of Hillary, and it was deeply upsetting to the Clintons.</p>

<p>So who knows what connections Obama had that outranked even a former President. We know that Obama was seen as the puppet of Trilateral Commission-creator Zbigniew Brzezinski. So maybe Brzezinski&#39;s connections were stronger than even Clinton&#39;s. </p>

<p>There&#39;s also the mass of circumstantial evidence that Obama was groomed by the CIA from his infancy. His mom used to work for World Vision, which is a famous CIA front. (Interestingly, John Lennon&#39;s assassin also worked at World Vision. As well as Reagan&#39;s shooter, John Hinkley, Jr. George Bush, Sr., by the way, was friends with Hinkley, Sr., who ran World Vision. On the night Reagan was shot Neil Bush was having dinner with the Hinkley&#39;s: <a href="http://impiousdigest.com/the-bush-familys-greatest-hits-what-rockefeller-means-by-discretion/">http://impiousdigest.com/the-bush-familys-greatest-hits-what-rockefeller-means-by-discretion/</a>)</p>

<p>At any rate, yes: A lot of weird stuff was being run out of World Vision. And Obama&#39;s mom was affiliated with them, jet setting around the world as an 18 year-old, with no job and no visible means of support. Yet she had all this money.</p>

<p>She looks to all hell like a CIA asset. Even after she &quot;died,&quot; her social security number failed to show up on the national death registry. </p>

<p>So the woman&#39;s probably still alive somewhere.</p>

<p>If it&#39;s true that Obama&#39;s grandparents and mother were &quot;in the club,&quot; then it might explain all the doors that were opened up to Obama on his ascendancy to the Presidency.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s true. </p>

<p>Bill was a Rhodes Scholar. That scholarship program was set up to groom people to be advocates for British tycoon Cecil Rhodes&#39; plan to reconstitute the British Empire. Rhodes masked his plan by calling it &quot;Globalism&quot;. </p>

<p>In reality, it was hegemony from the British Banking system over the rest of the world.</p>

<p>Rhodes set up &quot;round table groups&quot; in all the Commonwealth countries to promote &quot;globalism&quot; and to erode national sovereignty. These groups were also designed to groom media figures, future politicians, academics, etc. These round table groups were set up in Canada, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, etc. In the United States, the round tassel group is called &quot;The Council on Foreign Relations&quot;.</p>

<p>You can read a brilliant book on this stuff by historian Carroll Quigley (in his book &quot;The Tragedy and the Hope&quot;). Quigley was Bill Clinton&#39;s professor at Georgetown, and Clinton cited him as his mentor.</p>

<p>Quigley was given unprecedented access to the minutes from the meetings of the Rockefeller Foundation. After plunging into the archives, he wrote a sort of &quot;true history of the 20th Century&quot;.</p>

<p>Basically, everything that&#39;s unfolding now was started by Cecil Rhodes back in the 1880s.</p>

<p>Clinton (like all Rhodes scholars) was flown to Oxford to receive his brainwashing. MSNBC&#39;s Rachel Maddow is also a Rhodes scholar. As is Democratic Senator Corey Booker. Also the RNC&#39;s Bobby Jindal, etc.</p>

<p>Someone made a video of how the Council on Foreign Relations hijacked our media. What we today call &quot;The Mainstream Media&quot; is nothing of the sort: It&#39;s Council on Foreign Relations media.</p>

<p>See here: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-FPAQlbmlSc&amp;amp;t=29s">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-FPAQlbmlSc&amp;amp;t=29s</a></p>

<p>I&#39;d compare Rhodes Scholars to Nobel Prize Winners. Sure, there&#39;s some potential political power to giving them out, but a lot of it is about bettering the name of the donor. Philanthropy always has an ulterior motive, but it&#39;s 90% washing the hands.</p>

<p>This situation has been engineered. I&#39;ve been watching it brew for the last 18 years. </p>

<p>The two preceding administrations intentionally weakened our border security.  </p>

<p>The Bush administration regularly pulled some hokey shit in cooperation with the EPA,  leaving gaping holes for unseen border crosses to happen while using endangered species as the reason agents can&#39;t patrol certain areas. </p>

<p><a href="http://archive.is/chyin">http://archive.is/chyin</a></p>

<p>The Obama administration cut funding,  initiated &quot;catch and release&quot; (release... on our side of the border), and ordered agents not to patrol certain stretches of border as well. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>no, think of it like warring houses, the clinton global initiative and podesta group on one side, the trump&#39;s organization with ties to israel and russia were on the other side.  </p>

<p>Israel played both sides but preferred trump.  Israel and Russia are both unified in the desire to see the US balkanized and removed from the UN sec council.  </p>

<p>Both Trump and Bill Clinton have partied on epstein&#39;s lolita express, and Epstein is known to have recruited underage girls out of mar a lago: </p>

<p>Roberts was working for $9 an hour as a changing room assistant at Trump’s Mar-A-Lago beach club, where her father was a maintenance manager, when she claims she was recruited to work as a masseuse for Epstein. She claims the invitation came courtesy of Maxwell. It was 1998, and Roberts was 15 years old.</p>

<p>NXIVM connects bronfman to alefantis and CEMEX is bronfman, so at a certain level they are all working together to make sure a steady supply of children disappears.  </p>

<p>This reads like it was pasted from a news article, do you have it? Otherwise, use full names when youre referring to POI, not “Roberts” so i dont have to comb your previous replies</p>

<p>Ok so the dude actually helped start the Clinton foundation, who steals kids...Clinton went there like 13 times to his islands.</p>

<p>It&#39;s right there...and your grasping and pulling on anything you can to ignore and try to connect something you can&#39;t.</p>

<p>It&#39;s slightly pathetic.</p>

<li><p>The girl lied, she had her case thrown out the first time and the second she herself went back in it.</p></li>
<li><p>He threw Epstein out after he hit on an underage girl</p></li>
<li><p>They aren&#39;t friends anymore so whatever he learned about him he didn&#39;t like.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>So you seem to be concerned about trafficking...how many posts did you make when Hillary cancelled the investigation on the state employees with CP on their computers? How about when they helped the silsbys who ACTUALLY got got kidnapping kids at a border and charged with it, how about bill actually flying to that island over 19 times, what about their pedo friends, Epstein helped start the Clinton foundation who steals kids from hati..</p>

<p>So where are your posts on this if your actually concerned? Why would you reach to try to ccontect something not connected while ignoring something with so much of an actual connection. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sawer, the supposed &quot;expertise&quot; in child sex trafficking, and his entire organization, have in one year managed to extract ONE minor from sex work. But he&#39;s probably busy making that Netflix documentary about his efforts...</p>

<p>He may be a good soldier, but this is not his area of expertise and his organization does not seem to be effective at much more than publicity and fundraising. Seriously, look at the website for V4CR.. it&#39;s all &quot;buy our shirts&quot; and &quot;shop using our Amazon affiliate link&quot; (seriously). The FAQ is all about donation or booking Craig to speak (for a fee). Even &quot;volunteering&quot; for them quickly turns into a money grab, requiring a $50 monthly donation in order to receive a certificate stating that you are a &quot;Warrior For Child Rescue&quot;.</p>

<p>How many kids have you rescued? It costs a lot of money to run an operation like that of course they need money, do you think veterans are just independently wealthy? If he is doing this as a job, hell even if it&#39;s a hobby, he is putting way more on the line than you are!  </p>

<p>Are you suggesting they&#39;re doing all of this to make money? If he wanted money he woild use his skills to go become a contractor and make 6+ figures a year.  </p>

<p>Some ppl cannot be pleased I guess. What would this man, or groups need to do for you to believe that they want to rescue kids? What people need to be doing it so they&#39;re skilled enough in your eyes to be doing this? </p>

Also, these armed loonies have destroyed any chances of a proper investigation as they’ve made videos of themselves contaminating evidence by digging through the place while calling every thing they see an obvious sign of a child sex dungeon. This is typical Pizzagate hysteria and it doesn’t help that you have armed psychopaths on site thinking it’s all a government cover up despite the fact they’ve already had police sent there to investigate and the media has been covering it.</p>

What was shown? I&#39;ve heard there were bodies and condoms and whatnot, but all anyone has seen pics of is homeless people trash...
If there&#39;s evidence of the claims that this is a child sex cult or whatever then make with the proof. If you can&#39;t because you don&#39;t have any then shut the fuck up already. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>No they do not &quot;frequently make underground rooms&quot;. Have you ever met a homeless person? They don&#39;t exactly exert a great deal of effort. They aren&#39;t digging underground rooms, alright.</p>

<p>The amount of manual labor it would require to dig out a livable underground shelter is not proportionate to the immediate hazards it proposes (flood, collapse, suffocation, etc). This is why homeless people use more practical things for their shelter, like tents, boxes, tarps, dense vegetation, and various combinations of these.</p>

<p>So now it&#39;s your job to make me believe that you believe there are great numbers of homeless people out there shoveling by hand, underground rooms in compacted earth &quot;for them to live in&quot; and that this happens so commonly that it can be described as a frequent occurrence.</p>

<p>&quot;You disagree with me ergo you&#39;re a shill! REEEEE!&quot; </p>

<p>Check these videos out if you doubt the effort people go through to find places to live. </p>

<p>In this video homeless people were punching holes through concrete and steel highways and carving out spaces to live, then carrying heavy furniture through the holes to live in: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1_C7l7iAI4">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1_C7l7iAI4</a></p>

<p>In this video homeless people were dragging furniture, water tanks, bedding, and other heavy to carry stuff <em>miles</em> into storm drains: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2VLQkdq74kk">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2VLQkdq74kk</a></p>

<p>This second video also disputes your claim that it can&#39;t be a homeless camp because of the immediate hazards. People DIE in Las Vegas storm drains every year. They are sustainable to sudden flash floods even when it&#39;s not raining, CO and methane gas buildup, etc, yet hundreds of people still live there.</p>

<p>I think the issue -- and this is not uncommon among conspiracy theorists -- is you have no real understanding of the realities of the key issues here, and just make blind assumptions to support your narrative. </p>

<p>Like &quot;oh homeless people wouldn&#39;t live in dangerous places!&quot; and &quot;oh homeless people aren&#39;t going to put a lot of effort into making a place to live!&quot; Both dead wrong if you ask anyone who&#39;s even spent a few minutes in an actual homeless encampment. </p>

<p>NAXALT fallacy. You can&#39;t point to exceptional instances and pretend that they represent the mean. If this is a homeless shelter, it is exceptional and uncommon.</p>

<p>Since it appears uncommon, it warrants investigation. If it turns out to be a homeless camp, then we know. But you&#39;re thinking up an less likely explanation and using it to justify ignoring certain evidence. There&#39;s a small chance some homeless people have buried a water storage tank for shelter, and a bigger chance that it may be utilized for nefarious purposes considering its location. There&#39;s no way to know without doing an investigation, which in and of itself may contain conspiracy, which is why we are both here anyways.</p>

<p>It&#39;s just weird that anyone would go to such lengths to explain away peculiar circumstances that could be cleared of suspicion so easily and with such little effort and resources, when it could possibly lead to the downfall of the global human market.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s the thing though -- dangerous homeless encampments are the norm, not the exception. By their very definition most are crime and disease ridden to begin with, even the &quot;normal&quot; tent ones. Many are remote and outside of emergency services. </p>

<p>There&#39;s literally <em>no evidence to ignore</em> though. It&#39;s a run of the mill homeless encampment. None of the things people are claiming exist, actually exist. </p>

<p>Restraints, a pretty big red flag if true. However you can clearly see in the video what the authors call &quot;restraints&quot; for kids are actually straps being used to support the makeshift structure and hold it together. </p>

<p>No, there is not. Take it from someone who has personally visited many of these sites -- homeless people are very ingenious with their structures. How many homeless encampments have you personally visited? Where are you getting your understanding of homeless encampment engineering from to claim that using such structures is unusual? </p>

</blockquote>

<p>It&#39;s not uncommon for homeless encampments to set up on large properties like that. It&#39;s buried and on the outer fringe of the property lines, in an area with no equipment and no activity taking place. The property owner and employees have no usual reason to = go out that far and a small company like that probably doesn&#39;t have the finances ot hire a private security company to do patrols. </p>

<p>Around here people set up tents in the woods behind many businesses. Yes they own the land, but how are they supposed to know they&#39;re there? </p>

<p>You&#39;re seriously reaching trying to connect the cement company to the Clinton Foundation. How many people are Clinton Foundation donors? And what&#39;s the amount we&#39;re talking here? It must be pretty low if it was an individual donor -- there are like $2,500 caps on those donations. </p>

<p>You could probably connect every single company in the country to the Clinton Foundation if you&#39;re only going by if someone connected to it donated to the foundation. Oh look the janitor made a $100 contribution! /s</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Since the person I responded to&#39;s post was removed for calling me a shill, I&#39;ll add my explanation here: </p>

<p>Check these videos out if you doubt the effort people go through to find places to live. </p>

<p>In this video homeless people were punching holes through concrete and steel highways and carving out spaces to live, then carrying heavy furniture through the holes to live in: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1_C7l7iAI4">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1_C7l7iAI4</a></p>

<p>In this video homeless people were dragging furniture, water tanks, bedding, and other heavy to carry stuff <em>miles</em> into storm drains: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2VLQkdq74kk">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2VLQkdq74kk</a></p>

<p>These types of homeless encampments are the norm, not the exception. I think the problem is you, having never been exposed to this world before, equate &quot;homeless encampment&quot; with tents in the wilderness, and thus anything more warrants extensive forensic investigation because some random guy said its a child sex trafficking ring. That&#39;s simply not true.</p>

A couple of homeless people didn’t set it up. The best part though is that the guy who discovered all this spends all of his time LOOKING AT HOMELESS CAMPS! Don’t you think he might be a little better at identifying this stuff than you are??</p>

<p>Is it normal to have a giant water tank under ground wuth a lockable hatch on the outside, with a dresser and chair in it? And bloody clothes and a knife?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes. In many Homeless encampments people drag whatever furniture they can find to use in their &quot;homes.&quot; Finding odd stuff is not all that uncommon, here are what a few such encampmnets usually look like:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/znwyd8/inside-the-tunnels-las-vegass-homeless-population-calls-home">https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/znwyd8/inside-the-tunnels-las-vegass-homeless-population-calls-home</a></p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2VLQkdq74kk">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2VLQkdq74kk</a> (in this video you can see similar intricate setups like water tanks and rain collection setups). </p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1_C7l7iAI4">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1_C7l7iAI4</a></p>

<p>The fact is you have what clearly looks like a classic homeless encampment located on vacant land along a freeway in a big city. Without seeing any evidence of children actually being held, someone wwith a political agenda to push deemed it a &quot;child sex trafficking camp&quot; with ZERO EVIDENCE to support it. And r/conspiracy bought it hook line sinker. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It doesn&#39;t look at all like a normal homeless camp. The location isn&#39;t where the homeless go. The main structure they reference, isn&#39;t adult size, adults cannot fit in it, and kids cannot even be comfortable in it.  </p>

<p>And I guess trees with a bunch of restraints attached to it at varying heights, surrounded by curtains, are standard for homeless ppl?  </p>

<p>How hard are you trying to just ignore this? Do you think homeless ppl would drag a septic tank out to the desert, dig into the hard clay to bury it, and then toss their kids into the hot, non ventilated, make shift room that Doesn&#39;t even have a flat floor?   </p>

<p>And that all makes more sense to you? </p>

<p>In this certain situation the cops are discounting the evidence they are presenting and calling it a rundown homeless camp even all the evidence points to it being something worse. We got a bloody knife, stuff tied to a missing girl, trees with restraint on them, dungeons small enough only for a child to get in but out, scout trees, and the actual homeless camp right across from it said they don’t go over there because of the cartels. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>So then why the threats from probable cartel members over a homeless camp? We know human trafficking is a big problem everywhere but especially in the southern states where the cartels operate heavily. Police can be complicit in it just like any other human being. Look at the rape gangs in the UK. Police were found to be involved in the rapes and cover ups. The people on the ground have shown experts in human trafficking this place who agreed that&#39;s what it&#39;s used for and they&#39;re familiar with the area as well as it&#39;s homeless camps. Keep in mind this was stumbled upon by a group going out looking for homeless vets living in the desert because that&#39;s what they do. They would know what one looks like. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I mean, VOP are experts in tracking and locating homeless camps, they would know what to look for, and what is out of place for a normal homeless camp site or whatever.  </p>

<p>The former SEAL that was involved has spent at least the past year searching for human trafficking operations. Plus his military training and experience in combat, he is uniquely suited to be able to know what to look for, and what would be out of place at a standard homeless people camp.  </p>

<p>I mean, the trees with a bunch of straps attached to them, hidden from view by makeshift curtains.  </p>

<p>The alleged blood covered knife, clothing, towels.  </p>

<p>The bag of dark hair dye (if it&#39;s just a stop off for coyotes as some suggest,  then why would they be needing black hair dye, when the Mexican people are often dark/black haired.  </p>

<p>The big ass, multiple hundred of gallons sized septic tank type container, in the ground... so a homeless guy found this, dragged it here, managed to dig it into the hard AZ clay, and just tossed his kid in there? Because it should be noted that an adult cannot fit in it, and for a child, there is no spot to get comfortable or even to play, it&#39;s a curved on the bottom...   </p>

<p>The local homeless saying that they don&#39;t go into that area. Then describe where and why the homeless set up camps, and that they would not set up camp there, and that it certainly doesn&#39;t look like a homeless camp to them.  </p>

<p>Then, you have the one guy from early on in the story who was trying to scare VOP off, and he said that HE had built it, and it was so he could escape the heat.... right....  </p>

<p>I mean there are tons of little details that point to this NOT being simply a homeless hideout.  </p>

<p>But I guess it&#39;s easier to accept that one news story that said it&#39;s for homeless ppl, disregard everything being said and found, etc... I mean the government and local police could NEVER do anything unscrupulous, that&#39;s basically what you guys are saying at this point.  </p>

<p>I understand not jumping head first into the wild conspiracy theories or anything. But just as bad to completely disregard what all these vets are saying, guys who have nothing to really gain from this being relayed to trafficking. They won&#39;t even accept cash donations, but of course they must be awful guys. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah I just posted that. The police refusing to investigate is highly suspicious indeed because everyone that is not police says it&#39;s for child trafficking. More spots like this will be discovered and the American public will be made aware of the corruption in the government. Rest assure, this is only the beginning. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7zYifgQopA">video</a> update</p>

<p>With the knowledge that child protective services allowed the osteras/frodsham thing to happen without reform, that numerous whistleblowers say that the foster system is corrupt, and with the knowledge that arpaio didn&#39;t investigate child complaints for decades, and that he has only been rewarded, the new information fills in all the blanks.  </p>

<p>Arizona has been a major trafficking hub for the elite network that has legalized child abuse for their personal tastes, I have found smoking guns, the VOP found an actual gun.  </p>

<p>kids also lived?  are you nuts?  did you see the pictures?  </p>

<p>CEMEX, the property owner for the site, is connected to everyone in pizzagate, the rothchilds, clintons, mexican politicians, and david geffen.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Let me ask the one question that no one seems to be asking. If this CEMEX company owns the grounds and are connected as you said, then why did they build this makeshift child trafficking  camp out in the open close to a freeway where it could easily be found? Why not put this operation into one of their buildings where it can&#39;t be stumbled upon so easily?</p>

<p>companies who own tons of remote real estate are perfect for an operation like human trafficking</p>

<p>the higher ups in the company can make sure no complaints are heeded or forwarded from them, and if anyone else like VOP runs across what is going on, they can just say, &#39;we own so much land who could keep track of all this&#39; </p>

<p>ive been following this for a while now.  </p>

<p>first the deniers say, &#39;there is no way something so big could happen without people finding out&#39; </p>

<p>then they say &#39;well this evidence is flimsy&#39; </p>

<p>then they say &#39;well of course we know the elites are up to no good, but what good does it do to think about what we can&#39;t change&#39; </p>

<p>people are allowed to think if they don&#39;t know how....</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Those squiggly triangles are observed all over Arizona because it’s borrowed from Native American petroglyphs.</p>

<p>It may mean something in other parts of the world but in this region it is very much a Native American symbol. This area has tons of reservations and tribes all over the place....  it’s not out of place and also not hiding in plain sight. The local gas station all the way up to shopping centres, jewellery (like tradition al necklaces made by elders) to logos on water bottles use this symbol and would be very confused if you started talking about sex trafficking. </p>

<p>I was almost curious about the story but then these symbols were brought up as some sort of proof and the story loses all credibility to me.... like every time these symbols are used to prove a story is connected to pedo shit. </p>

<p>I don’t want to argue that somewhere or someone has used this symbol but correlation is not causation. </p>

<p>Just because you can see a connection or a mutual relationship between two symbols, doesn&#39;t necessarily mean that they are related.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What&#39;s sad is that something this serious gets flipped to a partisan issue.</p>

<p>Sometimes satire helps show hypocrisy.</p>

<p>I agree. This is a very serious issue, but it has nothing to do with t_d and making it an anti-t_d post does the entire topic and injustice. </p>

<p>The conspiracy is not that the T_D mods suck. Everyone knows that. The conspiracy is that there is a huge pedo-ring likely going back to the pizzagate days which was non-partisan and goes back farther than trump.</p>

<p>OP is acting like T_D mods are smart enough to be aware of all of this, but are covering it up because they already know that it connects to trump..</p>

<p>This goes beyond Reddit mods, republicans and democrats. This is a serious issue that&#39;s getting drowned out with disinformation and partisanship. My satire was an attempt to point that out. Trust me, I don&#39;t take this shit lightly and I apologize if it comes off like I do.</p>

<p>How much to Republicans claim they are holy warriors and exploit churches and cheap Bible verses for votes, yet they are all completely corrupted as evidenced by Open Secrets?</p>

<p>This stuff hits both parties. Republicans are worse than Democrats when it comes to this Blackmail and corruption scheme. Yet just because Trump ran an &quot;R&quot;, people and the cult of Trump think the Republicans are innocent of this long running game. They need to be red pilled and prepared that some of thier heros are guilty disgusting slime balls too.</p>

<p>I want both parties to be exposed and destroyed. They don&#39;t represent the people. They deserve to be fired. This country needs a reset. The Republicans  should not be shielded just because the heat is on the Clintons and Soros right now. </p>

There is literally nothing here besides videos of a few guys going through a homeless camp and assuming every single thing they find is linked to child sex trafficking.  No people at the camp, no children, nothing but conjecture based on some random items and some shit tied to a tree that was used to hold up a structure, which they&#39;re calling restraints.

    <div class="md"><p>Since the person I responded to&#39;s post was removed for calling me a shill, I&#39;ll add my explanation here: </p>

<p>Check these videos out if you doubt the effort people go through to find places to live. </p>

<p>In this video homeless people were punching holes through concrete and steel highways and carving out spaces to live, then carrying heavy furniture through the holes to live in: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1_C7l7iAI4">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1_C7l7iAI4</a></p>

<p>In this video homeless people were dragging furniture, water tanks, bedding, and other heavy to carry stuff <em>miles</em> into storm drains: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2VLQkdq74kk">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2VLQkdq74kk</a></p>

<p>These types of homeless encampments are the norm, not the exception. I think the problem is you, having never been exposed to this world before, equate &quot;homeless encampment&quot; with tents in the wilderness, and thus anything more warrants extensive forensic investigation because some random guy said its a child sex trafficking ring. That&#39;s simply not true.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Because it goes against their sub-reddit rules you goddamn retard. I&#39;m sorry but the board for Donald Trump Support is not the board to report pedophiles. Perhaps you should look in <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/news">/r/news</a> or <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/politics">/r/politics</a> (lmfao)</p>

<p>The mere idea that the_donald subreddit is blocking pedophile rape camp posts because they are in favor of it is the highest level of retardation one can think of.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Fuck. Got as far as the rape trees, couldn&#39;t keep watching. I am numb with rage.</p>

<p>It&#39;s a good thing these (fucking awesome) dudes found them instead of someone like me. They&#39;re being all professional, whereas I&#39;m pretty sure I would have just set up a little nest and just starting taking out anyone who showed up.</p>

<p>What the fuck is wrong with people.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>He&#39;s not even Craig Sawyer, it&#39;s weird the person you replied to claimed it. All you have to do to see this is go to his Youtube-channel (just write Craig Sawyer on Youtube). Totally different guy. I don&#39;t know who the guy in that linked video is but he&#39;s younger, skinnier, has different facial hair and facial features (Sawyer has dark brown hair and is greying, this guy is ginger), higher voice, etc. Sawyer also seems to be a pretty calm guy and just uploaded a video update, and speaks in a very calm and concise manner.</p>

<p>This isn&#39;t even one of those cases where it&#39;s ambigious and people just try to &quot;defend&quot; someone, this is legit not him and I doubt he&#39;s even supposed to be and the person just made a mistake in thinking it&#39;s him. I didn&#39;t see any indication the guy in that video was meant to be Sawyer.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Trump might be a douche, maybe even a perv....but your purposely trying to connect something that has nothing to do with him and making things up.</p>

<p>This is why he won the election...one group consistently accuses the other of something they are guilty of...if anything, this will lead back to the Clintons, per usual.</p>
