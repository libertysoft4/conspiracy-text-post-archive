        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>First of all, thank you so much for all of your helpful comments the other day, it really helped me get through a time where I tumbled a bit too far down the rabbit hole.</p>

<p>June will undoubtedly be a very hard month for me. In two days, it will have been exactly one year since I started exploring many of the conspiracies that led me  down the path I&#39;m at right now. It started with one simple Google search last June: Bilderberg. Ever since I typed that word, my perception of reality has been completely flipped upside down. </p>

<p>Furthermore, In an even darker irony, two days will officially mark the beginning of Bilderberg&#39;s 2018 meeting - a meeting designed to warp our world into an even darker and more cruel place. </p>

<p>I&#39;m not sure what it is, but the idea of <em>knowing</em> that there are evil, wealthy, and incredibly powerful men actively conspiring to kill you and destroy all you hold dear over the course of <strong>days</strong> sends me into a state of panic. </p>

<p>But if there&#39;s one thing I gathered from your comments the other day, it&#39;s that the only positive change that is created in this world is the change <em>we</em> as individuals enact. Because of this, I&#39;ve decided to use those four, incredibly nefarious days to volunteer at my local soup kitchen. If I&#39;m going to start making a change in this world, it has to start somewhere, even if it starts small. </p>

<p>Personally, I hope this &#39;new year&#39; marks a turning point in my life. A time where I can grow as a more enlightened individual and focus on helping others as a a remedy to the unfortunate reality I... <strong>we</strong> must live with for the rest of our lives. </p>

<p>So, here&#39;s to a new year - one filled with love, compassion, and a desire to spread the truth.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>some tips: Get yourself a dog, man&#39;s best friend. They are loyal AF and will love you unconditionally and you will get some walks, exercise, and learn some Zen from your dog. Having a dog in my life has always been one of the best things for me.</p>

<p>Get some exercise, gym, or DIY make your weights, biking, cardio, etc are vital</p>

<p>Eat right, get veggies in your diet, get plenty of vitamins, VIT C, r/nootropics for energy and cognitive wakefulness. L-Theanine is one of my favorites.</p>

<p>Find yourself a good hobby to learn. I build Glocks (Ghost guns) and am learning gun smithing, welding, building a motorcycle, fixing up bicycles, learning to brew beer, I make my own Kefir, Kombucha, gardening, I also do guerilla grows in the summer, and my uncle is a jeweler so he&#39;s teaching me some skills with that on the side too.</p>

<p>On top of that, meditation and spirituality is vital for mental health, acceptance, and being able to handle the rabbit holes. You want to acclimate and take everything slowly. Its like the shock of getting into cold water, once it hits your balls, you are like &quot;fuck&quot; so you take a few dips before you are ready to go lower.</p>

<p>r/dzogchen r/zen r/taoism r/mysticism anything that has to do with enlightenment, awareness, chakras, nonduality, gnosticism, etc are all where its at.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Also, detoxify your surroundings and the food you eat.  Most beds, sheets, pillows (and covers), furniture, curtains, carpets etc have chemical flame retardants.  These can cause cancer and you spend 8 hours a day, wrapped in it, with your face mushed into it (young children are more susceptible to the chemicals than adults).  </p>

<p>Eat organic, wash your berries and other veg/fruit thoroughly.   The above post covers most of it though.  Try and join a club (most are free) in your area.  Loneliness is a cause for many diseases. </p>

<p>(The 5 stages ov thee Awakening Process )</p>

<p>WoW a whole year !
Not to be a dick .BUTT<em>, growing up in a what seems to be the norm around here &amp; not - I was a kiddy porn star - experimented on in projects that still must be classified because I can find little or no information on them / incestuous militant drug-dealings  /
My awakening was in the fourth- grade -nearly over 30yrs ago 
[everyone I know has a big butt. peewee]
Definitely not because I got to do a “golag-breach”-
It was the same day I helped to 8th grade girls break their arms . By slamming a door on their bathroom stall so they could get sent home from school -
A riot later ensued ( all I remember was that it was initiated by older children at the school )
I was in an advanced program - I had been glorified for my excellence in aRT &amp; sciences- in the paper constantly &amp; celebrated - however when the school closed - I was put where the “lodge” decided to cover its tracks - Hence began a debriefing that continues to this day - which was
” Everything you were everything you saw everything you did NEVER HAPPENED “
“Do you understand me ? We have a (blankety blank) here . I hope I made myself clear . Because if you do . You will be sorry. For the rest of your life “
Needless to say I’m not sorry - but as for making it to the acceptance stage - How can I ? 
I’m the youngest in my family. Basically an accident. My siblings where all indoctrinated by the Program and have profited proudly- I came &amp; went over the years searching for answers, had I listened (to the people who tried to help me ), I wouldn’t of struggled the way I did &amp; do - I am still quick to rage which to most is inexcusable however I can’t help but relive the horrors of my past with every new person I meet - I ended the “sins of the fathers “ but in doing so - by being ostracized by the “Club” I have lost so many close friends by my ignorance- I like to feel something started with me all those years ago - but after the latest attack I have little or no protection-
This cat wanted to kill themselves when people want to kill me ? Funny - NOT THAT IM NOT GRATEFUL FOR THEIR HONESTY AND THEIR HUMILITY FOR REACHING OUT &amp; ESPECIALLY THEIR RESOLVE !
The only thing anchoring me are a few websites &amp; you tubers that BELIEVE what I KNOW , what I’ve had to live through ,is real _they only believe in their heart !!!
And God I love them !!! Not very many ! But I do !
I am partially doing this for myself and my daughter .We we’re both very  blessed in completing the awakening &amp; freeing us both from utter darkness-
However that darkness has returned - who do you go to when you know the Major is as sick as your abusers &amp; everyone beneath her is as dirty or may be on the payroll as well - that Attorneys are as bought as the addicts ?
You guyz know all this Jazz !Its the same protocol &amp; it constantly continues &amp; I am fucked - “some people should die that’s just conscious knowledge *“JA</em>
In short they’ve killed my closest &amp; last protector -
And I’ve been frozen for years -having to digress fir acceptance back to depression- One I don’t see out of no matter what - all I can accept. personally &amp; in my opinion and circumstance-THEY’ve Finally Won !
I probably shouldn’t write this crap here - I feel like I’m in a circle of dominoes &amp;one push on one of them  &amp; perhaps it will take me as well ?
I’m not looking for a digital hug - I’m just found another place to vent - maybe someone can learn something or maybe not !
I am proud of all ov youes who came to this kids aid -
AND IM PROUD IF HIM !!! 
It’s such a ride ! WOuuch!
Nevertheless I hope this fills you with revolutionary ecstasy &amp; the awareness of only assertively active program in the works : Conflict ? Or Mutual Respect </p>

<p>I’m proud of this kid - you kept me here a little while longer to fight -( I’m sorry- I’m totally F’ed up I want to and could kill indiscriminately if needed to - for goodness sake - I can’t begin to say how many times being an aRTist I was asked if I could take care of problems people were having - I know it’s wrong - but do we really have a choice- that’s being affective ? If not then - someone with Access to these TI’s should rally us “victim/survivor” types to organize to do something other than cry in groups ! I know whose heads should roll and I’m an incurable dis’ease !)
Who knows maybe I’m just jealous !?
? Grieving still as well -
Thank you all for knowing what you do and carrying on !!!
Ive buried Hope next to Faith - but there is no death is there-</p>

<p>“The Black Sheep
by Karen Finley
After a funeral someone said to me
You know I only see you at funerals
it’s been three since June–
been five since June for me.
He said I’ve made a vow–
I only go to death parties if I know someone before
they were sick.
Why?
’cause–’cause–’cause I feel I feel so
sad ’cause I never knew their lives
and now I only know their deaths.
And because we are members of the
Black Sheep family.</p>

<p>We are sheep with no shepherd
We are sheep with no straight and narrow
We are sheep with no meadow
We are sheep who take the dangerous pathway through
the mountain range
to get to the other side of our soul.
We are the black sheep of the family
called Black Sheep folk.
We always speak our mind
appreciate differences in culture
believe in sexual preferences
believe in no racism
no sexism
no religionism
and we fight for what we believe
but usually we’re pagans.
There’s always one in every family.
Even when we’re surrounded by bodies
we’re always alone.
You’re born alone
and you die alone–
written by a black sheep.
You can’t take it with you–
written by a former black sheep.</p>

<p>Black Sheep folk look different from their families–
It’s the way we look at the world.
We’re a quirk of nature–
We’re a quirk of fate.
Usually our family, our city, our country
never understands us–
We knew this from when we were very young
that we weren’t meant to be understood.
That’s right. That’s our job.
Usually we’re not appreciated
until the next generation.
That’s our life. That’s our story.
Usually we’re outcasts, outsiders
in our own family.
Don’t worry–get used to it.</p>

<p>My sister says–I don’t understand you!
But I have many sisters with me here tonight.
My brother says–I don’t want you!
But I have many brothers with me here tonight!
My mother says–I don’t know how to love someone like you!
You’re so different from the rest!
But I have many mamas with me here tonight!
My father says–I don’t know how to hold you!
But I have many daddies with me here tonight!</p>

<p>We’re related to people we love who can’t say
I love you black sheep daughter
I love you black sheep son
I love you outcast, I love you outsider.
But tonight we love each other
That’s why we’re here–
to be around others like ourselves–
So it doesn’t hurt quite so much.
In our world, our temple of difference –
I am at my loneliest when I have something to celebrate
and try to share it with those I love
but who don’t love me back.
There’s always silence at the end of the phone.
There’s always silence at the end of the phone.</p>

<p>Sister–congratulate me!
NO I CAN’T YOU’RE TOO LOUD.
Grandma–love me!
NO I DON’T KNOW HOW TO LOVE
SOMEONE LIKE YOU.
Sometimes the black sheep is a soothsayer,
a psychic, a magician of sorts.
Black sheep see the invisible–
we know each others thoughts–
we feel fear and hatred.
Sometimes some sheep are chosen to be sick
to finally have average, flat, boring people say
I love you.
Sometimes, black sheep are chosen to be sick
so families can finally come together and say
I love you.
Sometimes, some black sheep are chosen to die
so loved ones, families, countries, and cultures
can finally say
Your life was worth living!
Your life meant something to me!
I loved you all along!</p>

<p>Black sheeps’s destinies are not necessarily in having
families, having prescribed existences–
like the American Dream.
Black sheeps’s destinies are to give meaning in life
to be angels
to be conscience
to be nightmares
to be actors in dreams.</p>

<p>Black Sheep can be family to strangers
We can love each other like MOTHER
FATHER SISTER BROTHER CHILD
We understand universal love
We understand unconditional love
We feel a unique responsibility, a human responsibility
for feelings for others.
We can be all things to all people
We are there at 3:30 a.m. when you call
We are here tonight ’cause I just can’t go to sleep.
I have nowhere else to go.
I’m a creature of the night
I travel in your dreams
I feel your nightmares.</p>

<p>We are your holding hand
We are your pillow, your receiver,
your cuddly toy.
I feel your pain.
I wish I could relieve you of your suffering.
I wish I could relieve you of your pain.
I wish I could relieve you of your destiny.
I wish I could relieve you of your fate.
I wish I could relieve you of your illness.
I wish I could relieve you of your life.
I wish I could relieve you of your death.
But it’s always
Silence at the end of the phone.
Silence at the end of the phone.
Silence at the end of the phone. “</p>

<p>Cut out the booze, cut out the caffeine. </p>

<p>Pray. Ask for support and the finding of others like you. </p>

<p>It&#39;s a dark night of the soul, no doubt, but when you get out on the other side, it all gets pretty zen and almost like you&#39;re watching a theatrical production from really good seats. </p>

<p>In some ways, despite all the horror of which I&#39;ve become aware, I&#39;m the happiest and most content I&#39;ve been in my life, personally, while still feeling the profound pain being inflicted upon the world by the dark ones. A strange dichotomy. </p>

<p>It&#39;s good to go back every once in a while, but it&#39;s also good to take long breaks from it. If you&#39;re smoking every day, it&#39;s not good. When I&#39;m doing that, it really takes like three days or so to get back into the normalcy groove. </p>

<p>You don&#39;t really <em>know</em> that, though. </p>
