<p>The vast majority of the commenters agree with the police and mock the veterans.</p>

<p>What the fuck kind of conspiracy community does that?</p>

<p>You guys find it that unbelievable that a coverup relating to child Trafficking may occur in a city where the Mayor is LITERALLY a fucking ROTHSCHILD?</p>

<p>Like I feel like even normies would see that name and go &quot;hmm where have i heard that name?&quot; or conspiracy types would start an awareness campaign, but he has been elected twice.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.mayorrothschild.com/">https://www.mayorrothschild.com/</a></p>

<p>IF anyone needs more proof this community is compromised this is it.</p>

<p>No personal investigations, no elaborate discussions, just a blind agreement with the media and police, a snarky attitude towards veterans trying to stop trafficking, and a smug sense of being correct with no further research needed.</p>

<p>Disgusting</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Lets sample some comments</p>

<p>&gt; The patriot in the tower that was guarding the site and live streaming over the past 2 or 3 days interviews the father and son who put the logs and tarps over the cell around the 15 minute mark of this video</p>

<p><a href="https://m.facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=1420872158059693&amp;amp;id=1415347948612114&amp;amp;_rdr">https://m.facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=1420872158059693&amp;id=1415347948612114&amp;_rdr</a></p>

<p>after seeing that video I stopped even considering a child rape camp ever existed on that property.</p>

<p>---------------</p>

<p>&gt; It was basically just a vigilante group, and while their intentions may have been good, that isn&#39;t the best way to go about an investigation. </p>

<p>-----------</p>

<p>&gt; I don&#39;t know their intentions and whether they were good or not, but it reminds me of going deer hunting without a doe permit. When you&#39;re only allowed to hunt bucks, you start looking so hard for bucks that you start wishing antlers on the does you see. Kinda seems like they&#39;re doing the same thing... so obsessed with finding child trafficking that every little thing they see becomes evidence of it, whether it actually makes sense or not. </p>

<p>---------------------</p>

<p>&gt; He seems awfully worked up about it, so I think he feels like he&#39;s protecting people out there. To be honest, there are a lot of people twisting this into some Rothschild/Clinton Foundation conspiracy theory but I don&#39;t think the vet group has pushed any of that. </p>

<p>I just want to jump in on this one and mention the Mayor of Tuscon literally has the last name Rothschild, and that the company whose property this was is CEMEX, they were given a Haiti Project by the Clinton Foundation, and they donated straight cash to the foundation as well. So basically this upvoted and agreed with comment is blatant gaslighting.</p>

<p>-----------</p>

<p>&gt; Also I think the end result of human trafficking isn&#39;t tying kids to a tree in the desert and raping them, it&#39;s forcing them into prostitution somewhere. </p>

<p>he starts going through the whole 5 stages of grief when confronted about facts on how the cell got built he went into the denial stage and says on the video &quot;well im not an expert on child trafficking&quot;  </p>

<p>the day before he&#39;s on facebook streaming making a call to arms for patriots to patrol hwy 19 for any suspicious trucks.  These paranoia operations people are getting paid to incite are fucking up innocent peoples lives.  I hope your pieces of silver are worth it</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It takes time to move kids/ make arrangements. You might have a kid before you have a buyer. Its my answer to the question you asked and by no means am I correct. Considering I dont have first hand knowledge of the camp or the operations of pedophile rings. If you thought you found a pedophile camp you would be worked up also unless you are indifferent to that type of activities. Doesn&#39;t mean an assumption is correct just that you probably would be worked up if it was your first thought in the scenario. They went out looking for Homeless vets, The work their group does with the abused most likely was the reason they made the conclusion that they did. Can I ask why your so against the idea? I look at the camp from the two news reports done by the reporters sent out there and I can see it doesn&#39;t look like what i would perceive as normal. Im not homeless in Arizona so Im not an expert. Unfortunately it doesn&#39;t pass the eyeball test of a run of the mill camp. The eyeball test is not scientific, I cant argue that. One last thing is wouldnt Seals have an idea of what a spider hole/cell look like compared to a normal base camp. If that tire tunnel isnt a cell then is it a root cellar with bad accessibility because an adult isnt crawling through it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s sort of a boy who cried wolf situation.  Many on this sub have been pushing Pizzagate for over a year now with no direct evidence of any victims being harmed.  As a result, people are rightfully skeptical of claims of child sex rings.  There&#39;s also no direct evidence of children being hurt here either, yet you&#39;re insinuating that it&#39;s suspicious that not everyone immediately jumps on board with believing this.</p>

<p>Also when you unironically use words like &quot;normie&quot; it makes it even harder for people to take you seriously.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I dont even know where to start with this comment.</p>

<p>Pizzagate was and is still compelling, Alefantis Instagram was disgusting, his followers were literally satanic and pizza themed, he owns a mysterious museum that no one is allowed into, the camera was pointed away from the shop the day of the shooting and pointed back at the shop the day after, they host sexual themed parties, they have bands like Heavy Breathing which talk about child sex being a &quot;preference&quot;.</p>

<p>And thats just a sample of the various things that have made people suspicious.</p>

<p>And debunkers love to make PG about nothing more than that single pizzashop but it is really about Elite and Occultic Pedophillia.</p>

<p>For Example Known pedo Epstein owning an Island that features and Occultic temple with a giant Owl Statue on it (Bohemian Grove)</p>

<p>Or his plane that had everyone from Courtney Love to Bill Clinton to Donald Trump as passengers.</p>

<p>Should not waste my time responding to this further but will also point out that Normie is a perfectly fine term to describe people who have no inkling of the potential and proven conspiracies people who get all there news from Facebook or the MSM</p>

<p>Okay you said a lot about things that are apparently &#39;suspicious&#39; to you, but you still haven&#39;t provided any actual evidence that any children have been harmed by anyone.  And until you do, there&#39;s nothing wrong with people being skeptical, or in your words &#39;suspicious&#39; about investing belief in these claims.</p>

<p>Well can you provide the name of the book and author, maybe even a link? You&#39;re saying there is a person out there whole published something where she details </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Abuse endured at the hands of Hilary</p>

<p>and somehow this &quot;credible&quot; account has gone unnoticed by the entire right wing media? Also what was the &quot;abuse&quot;?</p>

<p>You say victims have come forward yet you make no direct links between these victims and Hillary or podesta. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Dr. Phil has done an episode on the elite pedo ring</p>

<p>Just because there have been and are pedo rings out there doesn&#39;t mean Podesta or Hilary are involved with it. That Dr. Phil line in no way supports any claims about pizzagate.</p>

<p>Also related to this, way back in the day, Oprah had a woman on who explained she was member of a family that practiced satanic ritual abuse:

<p>Check these out if you are interested, these reports/accounts go far back. This isn&#39;t &#39;new&#39;, nothing is new under the sun. We are just being made aware.</p>

<p>Does this prove pizzagate? Not sure, but something is going on. But, if you would ever consider the reason it&#39;s called pizzagate you&#39;d realize it has zero to do with a pizza parlor. Pizza is the word recognized by FBI as the term pedos use in reference to child porn. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Actually, I&#39;m pretty sure it was called pizzagate specifically because it had to do with a pizza parlor, namely Comet Ping Pong. And yet, after 1.5 or so years pizzagate &quot;researchers&quot; still have nothing tangible to show for it besides the leftover pizzagate t-shirts they were peddling. Although there&#39;s no universal consensus on the scope of what pizzagate refers to, it certainly started with Comet Ping Pong and I believe when that went nowhere, people started expanding the term to high profile pedophiles in general like Saville or Epstein to lend it legitimacy since no one can deny that they exist, unlike the Comet Ping Pong debacle.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, I would not say asking for evidence is trolling, but I&#39;ve seen you ask for evidence of the existence of God. You just seem more like you&#39;re interested in arguing with people you view as beneath you intellectually, and I just honestly don&#39;t want to play that game with you.</p>

<p>I know how this kinda works, I&#39;ll send you something and you&#39;ll scan it until you find a quotable sentence. Then you&#39;ll say the whole thing is fake because of that one error, or the person is disinfo because of it.</p>

<p>It&#39;s just not worth it, unless the other party is actually interested in figuring out the issue. You clearly are not, especially how you&#39;ve taken the way I said &#39;Dawg&#39; and attempted to throw it back into my face.</p>

<p>So, maybe if you calm down and come back later I could show you some evidence of vote manipulation and forum sliding from both sides of the aisle. However, I&#39;m not interested continuing this right now, so throw as many dawgs as you want, call me whatever. I&#39;m good.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You should realize the amount of shills and trolls are high. I dont know why a homeless person needs hair dye and shackles attached to tree&#39;s. The spider hole only a child would fit into also doesn&#39;t make sence to me. Its not like its for defense against other homeless if you were a drug mule and I wanted to rob you Id look in the tire for your drugs, so its not a good hiding spot. Pizzagate has alot of people ready to blow off any mention of pedophilia. Pedophiles have a support network or they wouldn&#39;t be so successful. Ive found as soon as you mention pedophile people lose intrest or automatically try to discredit the story. In my opinion after watching the videos by the Vets and News crew&#39;s it isnt hard to think that yeah its not just a homeless camp. The mere mention of the Rothchild&#39;s or Clinton Foundation makes people also dismissive. Reddit lives off of the idea that its a place of free thought and controlled by the users when there is plenty of corporate money involved. Its full of shills, trolls and people who think that they are more important than what they really are. Shadowbanning and astroturfing are just a reality of reddit. I dont think its just a homeless camp and I dont think its for drug running either. That said its going to be hard to prove to people its a pedophile camp.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks for confirming you don&#39;t know.  Makes your posts much easier to comprehend.</p>

<p>A troll in this context is someone that makes it their duty to go against common sense to stir up an argument.  Their goal is to ruin discussion and make people upset.</p>

<p>A shill would be someone whose job it is (as in they get a pay check) to do the same thing as the above.</p>

<p>So, when you said, &quot;they totally care about a reddit sub&quot; you came off extremely foolish and niave.  There actually are trolls and shills who do care about a reddit sub.  For some its literally their job to care about it</p>

You: Yeah right, how do you know shes even related to him?
Me: Her last name is Sanders, she is related to Bernie Sanders. Prove to me that she is not related.

<p>I mean I watched the video once but I’m sure I could go through and get every little detail as to why it is but come on, a crib at a homeless camp? Maybe one of them had a baby okay I understand, but restraints and cages. Watch the videos </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, if you’ve ever been camping you might see that people tie all kinds of shit to trees. Calling them “restraints” doesn’t make it so. There’s also the matter of all the evidence the “trusted patriots” claim to have seen but can’t produce. And of course the fact that by handling any evidence they’ve tainted it and made it useless.</p>

But I think some people who are denying this theory aren&#39;t doing it because they&#39;re shills, they&#39;re doing it because they aren&#39;t jumping to any conclusions all fast. Any person who abuses kids or sells em off are pieces of shit&#39;s, I think we can all agree on that. But it&#39;s stuff like this that is just, weird and odd. If you think about it, if the group of people that stumbled upon this place actively searches for homeless vets everyday, and actually finds them, then I wouldn&#39;t be too surprised if it is some sort of homeless camp. Maybe it&#39;s neither of those things, and it gets much deeper than we thought. If there&#39;s another possible explanation, then I don&#39;t see any harm in suggesting it. As serious as the situation is, I think it&#39;s smart as conspiracy theorists that we take a step back and try and see the bigger picture with anything that happens in the world. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>At the same time, it does NOT behoove the conspiracy world to assume ANYTHING is possible. Sometimes things -actually are- what they appear to be.  </p>

<p>We&#39;ve moved into this (IMO) ridiculous area where people immediately refute ANYTHING the police and/or MSM say--simply because that&#39;s what they said. Rather than attempting to actually contemplate the matter and then decide. We&#39;re also in a place where people are so determined to believe that (x) is possible that everywhere they look, they see evidence of (x)--even when sometimes there legitimately IS no (x) there.  </p>

<p>It&#39;s a real problem. Not everything is a conspiracy. Not every conspiracy should be given equal likelihood/weight. Not every theory should be considered &#39;possible&#39; because doing otherwise is &#39;shutting people down&#39;. Once upon a time, theories required at least -some- valid evidence before they were considered seriously. I think we ought to seriously consider returning to that.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;Valid&quot; evidence is subjectively interpreted when the evidence is circumstantial - and circumstantial evidence is the foundation of conspiracy theory - ergo it would be pointless to call for more of what you or someone else determines to be &quot;valid&quot; evidence. Now, that&#39;s not to say that <em>you</em> can&#39;t draw your own conclusions and dismiss something as unlikely, you&#39;re well within your rights to do that. I also <em>encourage</em> critical discourse and dissent. But trying to put subjective labels of &quot;valid&quot; or &quot;invalid&quot; on unquantifiable things like circumstantial evidence contradicts the nature of conspiracy theory in general. We are all just throwing things out there, making observations, guesses, sometimes stringing things together. Sometimes we criticize another&#39;s observation, point out flaws. That&#39;s fine. But when you say &quot;<em>that</em> evidence is only circumstantial&quot; it&#39;s absurd because ALL the evidence on this sub is circumstantial. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>People are demanding hard evidence because these guys are straight up calling it a human trafficking camp. Specifically for children. And they&#39;ve actually gone out and filmed the areas and only show things like straps tied to a tree, or baby cribs and all that. I&#39;ve seen homeless people use strollers to hold their belongings while walking down the street. So it&#39;s not crazy to assume homeless people kept those items. If you take all these people out of the picture, and imagine your friends found this camp one day. And they went up to you the next day and told you that the camp was used for abusing and selling children. And they provided the evidence that was aired in the news reports, wouldn&#39;t you still want some hard evidence that this camp was actually used for that? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, I understand why this set of evidence doesn&#39;t provide you with enough to form your own similar conclusion. And I respect that. I also don&#39;t blame you for asking for <em>more</em> evidence because I think we are all always looking for <em>more</em> evidence (whether it winds up being helpful or not is up to the individual). For me, I interpret the evidence given as making it <em>possible</em> that it could be a trafficking site. Do I have 100% confidence? No, because this is just a theory. But signs that we have seen, IMO, make it a certain possibility. The fact that this compound exists and a group of people who regularly deal with homeless folks yet found this site to be weird is enough to make me very curious about the whole thing. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>So listen, the global child sex trafficking conspiracy is my favorite conspiracy. At the very least its entertaining fiction. I think there is a lot of evidence to collaborate it, or at least make people doubt. Ronan Farrow the journalist that broke the Harvey Weinstein story reported about the extensive efforts Weinstein went to in order to silence and cover up the woman who were talking, including threats from that really creepy Israeli Private Intelligence Agency. Ronan Farrow in an interview on Fresh Air talked briefly about child sex trafficking in Hollywood being something he was looking into.</p>

<p>That doesn&#39;t really mean anything exactly, but my point is that this conspiracy is something to take seriously and something that intelligent people have taken seriously. Its creepy and there is a lot of evidence to it. </p>

<p>That said, I think this Tuscon thing is a little nutty right. Similar to the Pizzagate nonsense. There is no evidence except videos of some Militia guy saying he found a ledger and a bunch of evidence. The ledger has not been shared with the internet as far as I know, and the stuff that has been shared just looks like a homeless camp. This is stupid and not convincing.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The amount of people jumping to comment on this topic to say it&#39;s fake, an attention-grab, or not worth paying attention to is STAGGERING and extremely suspicious. On a sub that takes a fair shake at everything from the Sphinx to JFK to 9/11 theories, it&#39;s pretty curious that this--THIS--of all things is getting jammed with comments on how ridiculous or not-worth-while it is.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>He is NOT a Rothschild. Jesus Christ. How many times do people have to explain this to you all ?? Just because his last name happens to be Rothschild DOES NOT MEAN he has any relations to the OTHER Rothschilds. None. His mom owned a furniture store. Like I explained in another post, in many states, you can literally give your child any last name you want. So if you are an immigrant here and want your child to have a chance, you can name them Rothschild or whatever you want. </p>

<p>Also, someone mentioned in one of the posts a connection to Cemex. Something along the lines of the land is partially owned by a company that Cemex owns and the Mayor is a part of a law firm that owns a whopping 11,000 shares of Cemex so they can do whatever they want on the land. 11,000 shares of Cemex is about $66,000. Out of a multi billion dollar company. Yeah, that’s a hell of a connection. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Trusted vets ... I’m sorry, how exactly are they trusted ? Tell me this, what all do you know about these vets ? Since they are trusted, I’m assuming you’ve known them for decades. Grew up with them ? Served with them ? Obviously you know their family right ? </p>

<p>And how many of these vets are there involved in this ? A dozen maybe ? So, you believe that these vets are experts in child trafficking and sex camps right ? These vets are the ones who are right and the THOUSANDS of people in power in Tucson and throughout the state are all crooked. Because to be clear, that is exactly what you people are saying. Y’all have already stated all of Tucson PD is a part of the cover up. There are roughly 1,000 employees in the TPD, 850 police and 200 civilians. I’m guessing a couple hundred in the courts and local government. Oh and let’s not forget the hundreds in the local media. Then all the ones in the sheriffs department and then the state police. Of course, you really should extend it all the way to the top. </p>

<p>So yeah, I’m going to believe that instead of thousands of people being a part of this cover up, that there are a few vets who need psychiatric help. </p>
