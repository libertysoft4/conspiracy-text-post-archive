        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Hey conspirators. Can we share our experiences with alternative forms of medicine that worked for us? I’ll get right to some of mine:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>BHT to treat herpes/cold sores: don’t take that super expensive over the counter abreva shit. My parents literally never had an outbreak after taking some BHT </p></li>
<li><p>Intermittent/normal fasting to “cure” diabetes: diabetes isn’t a disease, it’s a symptom caused by constantly raising insulin levels. As much as we hear we need to be eating 24/7 or else we’ll go into starvation mode or ruin our metabolism (wonder who’s promoting ideas like these) take a break from eating and rid ur bodies addiction to eating constantly. Without insulin spiking up every second, insulin resistance will decrease. </p></li>
</ol>

<p>Improper swallowing, breathing, and forward head posture causes teeth misalignment and face breakdown: I’ve been practicing proper swallowing and definitely see changes in my face. This one is a handful and requires a lot of explaining. And I’m too lazy to do that so just google mewing.</p>

<p>Glasses promote elongation of the eye: ur eyes weren’t meant to look at stuff upfront and close for hours. When doing something that doesn’t require u to have glasses like reading a book or on the computer, take them off. Ur just making ur eyes worse by making close things even closer. Hence why ur vision gets worse </p>

<p>THEORY: antibiotics that pass the blood brain barrier to treat neurological diseases. Seeing how almost all patients with MS had the bacteria Borrelia burgdorferi. Some people are saying that diseases like MS and Alzheimer’s are caused by that bacteria and that they can be cured with heavy doses of antibiotics. I don’t know about this one but does anyone have experience with this?</p>

<p>remember there are going to be retards that try to discredit us by writing shit like tiger penis cures cancer. Plz just remember to do ur own research. curezone.org has a lot of cool/legit topics (but also some scammers be careful) I suggest u go there I’d medicine interests u </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I’ll ask again, can u plz elaborate? 
1. BHT is used as a preservative, is safe for consumption, and is an antioxidant. It’s found in cereals and most processed foods. 
2. Fasting is not dangerous. If ur a diabetic, u take drugs like metformin to control ur insulin levels when u EAT. By fasting ur not even raising ur insulin levels in first place and giving ur body the time to lower it
3. Proper posture, swallowing and breathing is dangerous?
4. Reading books and using the computer without glasses is dangerous?</p>

It breaks my heart to find people who think type ii diabetes is just too much insulin and it needs to somehow be lowered for everything to magically be ok. Here are some crash courses on diabetes by type for you all.        </p>

<p><a href="https://www.diabetesaustralia.com.au/type-2-diabetes">Type II</a><br/>

<p>Of course there is going to be a period in fasting where BSL drops, but if not regulated BSL will shoot up as the body breaks down ketones. Unmanaged BSL in diabetics is dangerous to the point is can cause coma &amp;/or death.    </p>

<p>Yes there have been some studies in mice, and a couple of <strong>short term</strong> studies in humans. These studies have not in any way established safety of intermittent fasting in diabetics, even for the popular 5:2 diet. Moreover, while there have been some short term successes with intermittent fasting during the aforementioned studies, there have also been situations in at least one study where intermittent fasting had the opposite effect. In all of the successes the subjects were heavily managed by health professionals and medication.               </p>

<p>It is scary to think that not only does OP think it&#39;s ok to play doctor with his made up treatments, but that the mods of this sub are allowing it to happen. This is a very real problem. </p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>Reducing fiber cures constipation.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The study used patients who had clinically diagnosed constipation and asked them to reduce dietary fiber intake, which helped them have regular bowel movements and less abdomen pain. It makes sense that fiber will cause bulkier stools, though the study doesn&#39;t say how much dietary fiber the patients were taking except &quot;high&quot;. On a personal note, I remember eating about a dozen of those cup-and-spoon ice creams in a day a few years back and getting abhorrent constipation late at night (it felt like trying to pass an iceberg). Since then I don&#39;t let go of my precious fruity dietary fibers and I haven&#39;t had anything similar happen.</p>

<p>Everyone should try different things and observe how their body reacts, reducing what causes them pain or discomfort but I&#39;d say my presumption that people generally don&#39;t have enough fiber and should take extra is correct more often than the reverse. Meat is necessary for the body, we need so much protein but plants are the other side of the coin and it&#39;s fair to say we need a balance of things on the platter.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>As a healthcare professional I understand there are sometimes better treatment options than those presented to patient by doctors and other clinicians. However, much of this thread is blatantly completely anecdotal, dangerous, and highly susceptible to placebo effect.</p>

<p>&quot;Oh shit I have x ailment and take y item now I feel better&quot; Is not good evidence based medicine. Also just because someone on YouTube said some crap doesn&#39;t make it true. I&#39;ve seen countlees people die from these home remedies for conditions that we could have reversed. I&#39;m not against home remedies, I&#39;m against spewing bullshit and not using evidence.  Most of you likely aren&#39;t around the sick and dying all day and don&#39;t know how frustrating it is to have a patient die from not heeding medical advice. So much of this is preventative.</p>

<p>I recently had a patient with kidney failure, decided to do some bullshit natural remedies instead of hemodialysis and other medications and died very quickly. Eating stupid blends of plants won&#39;t regenerate your kidney no matter what that guy on YouTube said and will not magically let your kidneys do their very important functions.</p>

<p>Extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>After many years of believing in mainstream medicine, despite solid evidence from personal experience that it was not effective at both diagnosing many health issues as well as treating many health issues (and that they don’t create medicines that fix the health issues, just usually mask the symptoms), I switched to naturopathic medicine. I went from “incurable” to completely healed in 3 months. My naturopathic doc explained how each thing works and how it heals so the natural medicine did not need to be taken indefinitely. It was an amazing experience to finally get my life back. </p>

<p>Since then, over 30 of my friends and family have seen the same doc and were healed of their health issues (like gout, diverticulitis, IBS, chemical depression, food sensitivities, Lyme Disease and other infections, MS, eczema, psoriasis, etc.). It’s amazing what can be done when the focus is on healing the body as opposed to masking symptoms. </p>

<p>THEORY: antibiotics that pass the blood brain barrier to treat neurological diseases. Seeing how almost all patients with MS had the bacteria Borrelia burgdorferi. Some people are saying that diseases like MS and Alzheimer’s are caused by that bacteria and that they can be cured with heavy doses of antibiotics. I don’t know about this one but does anyone have experience with this?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>None of this is true. MS, like many autoimmune diseases, is thought to be caused by a combination of genetic susceptibility, environmental factors, and possibly a viral trigger. It has nothing to do with <em>Borrelia burgdorferi</em> or any other bacteria.</p>

<p>Alzheimer dementia also has nothing to do with bacteria. It is caused by the accumulation of misfolded proteins in the brain. The main one, beta-amyloid, is a misfolded form of Amyloid Precursor Protein (APP) on chromosome 21. This is why virtually every person with Down syndrome (ie. those who have an extra chromosome 21) develops Alzheimer dementia by the time they are 40-50: the extra copy of the chromosome means they produce more beta-amyloid at earlier ages.</p>
