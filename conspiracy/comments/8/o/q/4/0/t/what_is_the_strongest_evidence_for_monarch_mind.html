<p>See for example the 1956 book <em>Rape of the Mind</em> by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joost_Meerloo">Joost Meerloo</a>. He was a prime witness of mind control techniques used in WW2 and the Korean War, and recounts his experience and knowledge on the subject.</p>

<p>It is not a big leap to assume these practices have &quot;leaped&quot; in the civilian realm, as many military &quot;innovations&quot; have before it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Google &quot;Full Greenbaum Speech&quot; for info on Satanic Ritual Abuse. I read about Ewen Cameron in the book <em>Whiteout</em>, but it takes the mainstream view that the mind control program was unsuccessful, so you can probably read a summary of his psychic driving experiments online, or seek out the MK-ULTRA documents on the CIA website.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh man I completely agree with you. It extends to so many other things. Don’t even mention to these people the POSSIBILITY of there being natural cancer cures, or even cures for autism or they get super twitchy. On a cancer sub I shared straight up medical research on curing cancer with this natural mineral and I got flamed. On the main cancer sub too if you post even evidence like that of this stuff they automatically ban it on the pretense of “quackery”. Apparently in the early 1900s homeopathic was winning against allopathic, so the elite families joined together and founded the AMA and put the buzzword of quackery out there the same way as they did with “conspiracy theorist” “antivax” “fake news” etc. it’s all insanely messed up and it blows my mind how people just buy into it.</p>

<p>As for flat earth, I mean what’s the big deal with entertaining the possibility? All I know is there is something up with the South Pole, the nazis were all over it and we still have CIA down there. I think it’s either flat earth, hollow earth, or the frozen remnants of Atlantis.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>wow now thats interesting! im very surprised to hear that about the cancer sub, very strange. i wonder if it has to do with the way we have been raised as a society or what, but there seems to be that profound sense of almost a stockholm syndrome type of thing. its like people want to keep the narrative and dont want any new knowledge or resources when it comes to some of these things. Iv heard a few things here and there about cures for cancer but at my last job i actually met several customers who told me their stories about the doctors giving them not that long to live and they beat the odds through alternative methods! yet it seems like it is still very taboo for some reason.  </p>

<p>That&#39;s not true. I have seen many people try to have civil discussions with flat earthers on the subject. The problem is that most flat earthers will not engage with the science and instead want to debate strawman arguments or just point to Youtube videos.</p>

<p>A friendly word of caution: there are so many people parroting the same myths about these things, that it is easy to assume that there is some kind of verified evidence to support their claims.</p>

<p>If you do your own research and focus on primary sources, you might find that things are not so clear-cut.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The fact people are soooooooooo willing to give up their personal freedoms. </p>

<p>It&#39;s like a mad dash to see who can cuck themselves the hardest.</p>

<p>It&#39;s like religion.. same parts of the brain no doubt. And btw aethisism is a religion/dogma in itself as no one knows what death is like and they believe it&#39;s going to be nirvana and nothingness... maybe it&#39;s tentacle torture for eternity??? The point is people LOVE giving their freedoms up for a false sense of security and they LOVE to self flagellate themselves as a way of coping with their shitty lives devoid of freedom, like working in a cubicle or slummy restaurant. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Torture programming, or what people commonly understand as Monarch mind control, does exist, however, there is yet no documentary evidence for a project code-named Monarch. There is evidence Mark Phillips invented the term in the 1990&#39;s. Survivors themselves claim other sub-project names such a Dragonfly.</p>

<p>Evidence for torture based mind control:
1. Documentary: A transfer order for victim Karen Coleman Wiltshire to Walter Reed Hospital. The medical records of Karen Wetmore. 
2. Formal victim testimony and empirical data: Valerie Wolf and survivors at the 1995 ACHRE congressional hearings.
The 2007 EASE series of surveys of survivors, and therapists (2000 respondents from 40 countries).
3. Survivor accounts (rarely mentioned in this sub because they&#39;re actually credible) Carol Rutz, Janet Thomas, Karen Wetmore, Annie McKenna, the Hersha sisters. The Hersha sisters were able to describe the floorplans of top secret military installations. The case of Billy Milligan, his Ragen alter spoke fluent Arabic. The control of Candy Jones.
4. The published writings and peer reviewed studies of MC contractors such as George Estabrooks, Louis J. West, etc., discussing the creation and manipulation of dissociative states and split personality.
There is much, much more. I suggest people begin by reading Walter Bowart&#39;s Operation Mind Control.</p>
