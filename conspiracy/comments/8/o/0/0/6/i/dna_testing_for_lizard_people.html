        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Ok, so I had the trippiest dream (completely unrelated) last night and I woke up with this weird as hell vibe. The last time I woke up in such a state, i opened my eyes and there was an elderly lady with short grey hair sitting at the foot of my bed. I was in and out of sleep and thought I was still dreaming until the lady said, and I shit you not, these were the first words out her mouth,  no hello or anything, “I’ve never met anyone with bipolar before.” </p>

<p>So obviously I was freaked out and kicked her the fuck outta my room. Turns out the lady was non other than a member of the Rothschild family, although I didn’t find this out till later. I do tend to love me a good conspiracy but I’ve got to say the whole “Elite banking families controlling the world” feels more like fact to me at this point. Anyways, the lady has been a client of my father for several decades and they are close friends now. Several weeks later I went to her house with my dad to deliver some work to her and we got on very well. Truth be told she is an absolutely lovely lady. Sharp as a razor and full of hope and interesting ideas. Over the course of a few meetings I feel like I became good friends with her and now if I’m in London for a few days I tend to visit her. We’ve gone for lunch, I’ve taken her shopping around Portobello and she even showed me her private garden which she told me she rarely takes anyone into.</p>

<p>After a few months of knowing her i was intrigued to discover she is actually the sister of - drum roll please... - Jacob fricken Rothschild! Now I’m not super well versed in their family lineage, but to my understanding he’s one of the heads of the family along with cousin Evelyn who is the Queens personal banker. </p>

<p>Like I said, she is an absolutely lovely lady who I have a lot of respect for. Apparently she doesn’t keep in touch with her family of whom she disapproves of. She even shortened her name so it wouldn’t be immediately apparent who she is. But.... and here’s the big hairy butt, as much as she’s led me to believe she isn’t a fan of her older brother, they are still siblings and share DNA! So my question to you reddit, assuming I’m not the daftest cunt in the world for even putting this here, what is the best piece of DNA I can swab to get scientifically tested to see if she has lizard DNA? </p>

<p>This is 100% true and I’m being 100% serious. I’ve got her phone number and I could call her right now and arrange to see her next time I’m up in London. She’s also going blind which is breaking her heart as she can no longer tend to her beautiful garden. Fortunately being blind might make it easier to swab said DNA. Anyone with a scientific background can help out? Cheers! </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That may well work. Just to clarify, I don’t actually believe they are shape shifting reptilian over lords now that I’ve met them. If I were to do it, it would be to try and dispel that myth. She might actually just go along with the idea though! 
The tinfoil hat wearing kid inside me is just bursting with curiosity, why do people even think they’re reptiles to begin with? Is it to do with the Anunaki? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thank you dude! Yeah I’m not too keen on doing it without permission either. Firstly because I feel like she trusts me somewhat and out of respect I don’t want to break that and secondly, if on the off chance they are reptiles fuck knows what kinda hell I might be getting into! 
I do intend on asking her more about her family and how it works but I’m not quite sure how to do it without being too invasive or sounding like a conspiracy fanboy. Truth be told I don’t know how much she would actually know, she seems very isolated from them, her daughter lives in France and I believe the closest person to her was a man from Tibet who became her lover, although he has since passed. She’s definitely chosen the “spiritual” path and although I’m sure she’s aware of what her family are up to, I’ve gathered that she’s pretty repulsed by the whole thing. I don’t really want to upset her because at the end of the day, she’s a lovely old lady. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, hair brush was my first instinct. I wouldn’t know who to take it to from there though... that’s why I was hoping someone with a scientific background could explain the process a bit. 
She does seem like the type of person who takes an interest in spirituality and esoteric pursuits so I intend on going down that avenue with her. As I said above, I doubt she would know what the families ultimate desires and plans are, she seems to have ostracised herself from the main clan. 
I feel like whatever I do I’ve got to do it soon because I think she’s somewhat suicidal. She also suffers from bipolar and ever since her lover passed away and now with the blindness, it seems to be taking a toll on her mental health. She speaks to my dad several times a week on the phone and he’s very concerned for her. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I can totally see why you think this. I wouldn’t take much pleasure in doing anything behind her back. However, given that this is one of the most talked about conspiracies of all time, I feel like I have a unique opportunity to either prove or debunk it.

    <div class="md"><p>you know full well that you cannot debunk a conspiracy theory. Lets say that you did what you&#39;re planning on doing - stealing this woman&#39;s bodily discards like a virus and secreting it off to have it tested for reptile DNA (god knows how you&#39;d be able to do this) - if you were hypothetically able to get conclusive evidence that she is not a reptile-human hybrid, then you&#39;d be accused of being apart of the coverup. conspiracies are immune to negative results, in fact you&#39;d only strengthen it. </p>

I was thinking regardless of the results, no one would believe me anyway so this might all be pretty pointless! I’m sure she’s vaguely aware of the conspiracies, I might just ask her what she has to say about it and leave it at that. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You know what, I think I will just ask her outright. I think she’s taken a real shining to me, kinda like a grandson. We’ve already bonded very quickly over having bipolar so Im sure there are more fascinating discussions on the table, her family being one of them. I know it’s nosey but this feels like such a unique opportunity. I’m sure she’s been asked many prying questions over her lifetime, i can imagine being such a prominent Rothschild must be somewhat of a burden.

<p>One thing that could be interesting however is how she appeared to you at the foot of your bed.

    <div class="md"><p>Your question rests on the assumption that lizard people even <em>have</em> DNA, which I find to be a flawed one. There is a virtually infinite number of ways in which one could go about storing genetic data. DNA is just one of many; the chance of a molecule analogous to DNA evolving in a separate biosphere is more or less zero. Of course, one could argue that it was the reptillians themselves who introduced DNA to the Earth, but that would require their presence here to go back billions of years, which makes one wonder why it is only in recent times that they have attempted to establish dominance.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Keep in mind that all three ideas you are citing here are distinct. The reptillian hypothesis states that an alien species similar in appearance to Earthern reptiles has infiltrated the highest echelons of global society, the Anunnaki hypothesis states that civilisation was gifted to primitive mankind by an unknown alien force, and the Planet X hypothesis holds that there hides an undiscovered ninth planet in our solar system. Neither of the three strikes me as very plausible, but don&#39;t let me tell you what to believe :- )</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My question is: when you get said DNA, how are you going to test it? Do you have your own lab? Or were you going to send it to 23 and me? If you send it out, and it actually has some strange findings, do you think you would get the actual results back? It would get covered up. So unless you are a DNA sequencer yourself, don’t bother!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Dude.</p>

<p>No matter what some dicks on the internet think, this sounds like a wonderful old woman who takes pride in her Garden, which when you break it down says a lot. On top of that, she has no interest in her families fortune, future or financial trade.</p>

<p>Yet, instead of respecting this woman, you want to nick some hairs off of her brush to prove she isn&#39;t a lizard?</p>

<p>Seriously, what the fuck is wrong with you? Were you dropped on your head as a child? Where is your goddamn human decency?</p>

<p>Shit like this is why society is fucked.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You’re very correct in your assumptions of her, she’s a great lady. It’s been an absolute privilege to get to know her and understand her world view. </p>

<p>In regards to what’s wrong with me, i for sure have a few screws loose amigo. If you hadn’t ascertained, she, like me, both suffer with bipolar. When I was going through a manic phase not too long ago I nearly took a mallet to some statue - this absolutely gorgeous Buddha rescued from chairman Mao - my dad was restoring for her, I’m infinitely glad that my mama stopped me because I fully felt like the statue was speaking to me and was getting increasingly paranoid that having something associated with the Rothschilds in the home was bad karma. This was before I really got to know her and stupidly assumed she was as evil as evil gets. 
Obviously it’s not an excuse, but hopefully this is an explanation as to why I jumped the gun a little  posting my story in this sub with my questionable morals attached. When the madness takes over, it’s a little hard to resist, as I’m sure you can imagine. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>No I can&#39;t imagine because I own my own mind. Do I stray? Of course, but I never let my human decency slip in any shape or form. To blame any illness, be it physical or mental, on basic standards slipping is to re-assure yourself that the Golden Ticket of illness that you possess, runs your life. </p>

<p>Take back control, one step at a time.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not here to judge, you make your own choices in life. I&#39;m just here to say &quot;is this really what you want to do?&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well owning your own mind is all well and good , I don’t necessarily believe that anyone truly does, although that’s a different debate all together. </p>

<p>I agree with your point in general and I feel like I am taking back control but it’s bloody difficult with a mental illness like bipolar. Hearing voices, not sleeping, up and down like a yo-yo... that shit will fuck most people up, so if you haven’t experienced that then I’m the naive one for assuming you could imagine such a thing. </p>

<p>I’m doing a hell of a lot better now though, unfortunately my standards still slip on what seems to be a weekly basis. I ain’t doing anyone proud unfortunately...</p>

<p>I love your final sentence though, nail on the head for me! Maybe get those screws firmly back in place :) I’ll keep that in mind! </p>

<p>When you feel you are slipping or when you have slipped, don&#39;t blame yourself, just be conscious of it and make sure it doesn&#39;t go that far next time.</p>

<p>Remember one important thing; You are only doing the best you can do with the resources provided.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>you may be suffering from more than just bipolar, you might also have schizophrenia, they tend to come hand-in-hand and also tend to manifest in very intelligent people (as you seem to be due to you having business with people of this calibre).</p>

<p>I would tell you to seek out help, but you won&#39;t listen anyway and I am just going to be down voted. </p>

<p>But I feel, this was exactly how my uncle was acting and talking weeks before he took his own life, as he suffered from the illness combination I listed above but constantly avoided seeking help. He was also extremely intelligent.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thank you dude! Yeah I’m not too keen on doing it without permission either. Firstly because I feel like she trusts me somewhat and out of respect I don’t want to break that and secondly, if on the off chance they are reptiles fuck knows what kinda hell I might be getting into! 
I do intend on asking her more about her family and how it works but I’m not quite sure how to do it without being too invasive or sounding like a conspiracy fanboy. Truth be told I don’t know how much she would actually know, she seems very isolated from them, her daughter lives in France and I believe the closest person to her was a man from Tibet who became her lover, although he has since passed. She’s definitely chosen the “spiritual” path and although I’m sure she’s aware of what her family are up to, I’ve gathered that she’s pretty repulsed by the whole thing. I don’t really want to upset her because at the end of the day, she’s a lovely old lady. </p>
