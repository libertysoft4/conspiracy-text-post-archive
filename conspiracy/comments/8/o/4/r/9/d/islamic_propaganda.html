        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Bit of a different thread. Recently I have read about the &quot;martyr&quot; Tommy Robinson, whilesuch full of irony. </p>

<p>Instead of believing that Islam is notoriously anti western or anti women I want people to research. </p>

<p>Honestly, I consider myself as nothing, i am not atheist nor religious because I&#39;m not sure, I just simply don&#39;t know. I am not Islamic in any sense. </p>

<p>So let&#39;s look at the propaganda. Every god damn single person i see points to muhammed fucking a child. I too was under this spell until I researched it. </p>

<p>Aisha had a sister, her sister was 10 years older, written in Islamic text. Her sister died in 73 a.h.  </p>

<p>We know she died at 100, in 73 a.h. So she was... 28 in 1 a.h. So if she&#39;s 28, Aisha is 18 in 1 a.h. </p>

<p>1 a.h = April 622. So if muhammed married Aisha in 619, how was she 6? </p>

<p>I am not arguing for this nor arguing against it, I just want to know how it came to be that monothetic religions, with the same angels and beliefs can be so vile to each other? </p>

<p>I think the propaganda of Islam even at its worst is akin to Christianity. </p>

<p>I guess my question  is, where does this hate come from? And for all those who want to &quot;quote&quot; the Islamic text, please do so and not a random hadith by a &quot;scholar&quot; 700 years later. </p>

<p>Also, mawar (?) Pearls to those on the side of the kaaba is interesting, especially since the meteorite has such a resemblance to the stones. </p>

<p>Hadith, Arabic Ḥadīth (“News” or “Story”), also spelled Hadīt, record of the traditions or sayings of the Prophet Muhammad, revered and received as a major source of religious law and moral guidance, second only to the authority of the Qurʾān, the holy book of Islam.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Your claim that hadith is not Islamic text is laughable. </p>

<p>Muhammad was a murderous warlord rapist, so for him to have a child bride is not inconceivable. </p>

<p>Child marriage was quite common not only in the middle east but all over the world at this time.</p>

<p>Islamic preachers use the Islamic texts to justify pedophilia to this day <a href="https://youtu.be/2iIxRoU-lSg">https://youtu.be/2iIxRoU-lSg</a></p>

<p>And in countries like Afghanistan and Yemen it is still happening today.</p>

<p>The irony is you mention Tommy Robinson, and although I find him to be a moron and don&#39;t really pay attention to him, the fact is he was &#39;reporting&#39;/protesting/shit stirring in regards to a Muslim child rape gang.</p>

<p>Although I personally don&#39;t find his arrest that objectionable if he committed contempt of court by compromising the integrity of a trial like they say he did.</p>

<p>Even if she was an adult, mohammed the warlord still heard voices in his head and was not sure of their origins. So we have a schizophrenic creating a whole cult around his schizophrenic voices, borrowed the rest from the Jews and Christians, made sure there was lots of submission so no questions the cult, and then boom(pun intended) power and his cult solidified in history</p>

<p>Muhammad&#39;s first revelation was an event described in Islam as taking place in 610 AD, during ... &quot;when I was midway on the mountain, I heard a voice from heaven saying &quot;O Muhammad! you are the apostle of Allah and I am Gabriel.&quot; </p>
</blockquote>

<p>The cave he meditated in, may have been giving off a variety of different gasses giving him hallucinations as well which is another theory to his schizophrenia </p>

<blockquote>
<p>The moral degeneration of his fellow people, and his own quest for a true religion further lent fuel to this, with the result that he now began to withdraw periodically to a cave named Mount Hira, three miles north of Mecca, for contemplation and reflection.[3] Islamic tradition holds that Muhammad during this period began to have dreams replete with spiritual significance which were fulfilled according to their true import; and this was the commencement of his divine revelation.[1][page needed][4][page needed] This created inclination in him to engage himself in solitary worshipping</p>

<p>Post a source that you are right, back it up.</p>

<p>What random shit, that the warlord was either high on ethylene or a  schizophrenic? That&#39;s hardly random because even if mohammed was not a pedo and aisha was not 8, them he was still either high or a schizophrenic</p>

<p>Yes</p>

<p>The majority of traditional hadith sources state that Aisha was married to Muhammad at the age of six or seven, but she stayed in her parents&#39; home until the age of nine, or ten according to Ibn Hisham, when the marriage was consummated with Muhammad, then 53, in Medina.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Take Islam and Tommy out of the equation. Why cant a trial be public record or reported on? Especially one that involves nearly 30 defendants. I believe thats what got people talking recently. A media blackout on a trial not supporting Tommy or hating on Islam. Why are some religion&#39;s protected and some are not. Christian pedophile case top billing. Islam equals  misunderstood. Jewish equals victim. People are getting tired of these protections being placed on certain groups.

    <div class="md"><p>I dont quite understand why you want to be proven wrong when you were asking for people&#39;s opinion on a topic. My belief is the majority of people in the Western Nations practice bastardized religion. Life is to good in the west to follow the holy books. Christians, Muslims, Jews. If we practiced the holy books to the letter the world would look much diffrent. So when you see people following their religion from other areas it seems crazy.
Also a bigger problem is free speech in people&#39;s mind and a trial that isnt allowed to be talked about. Question for you, why should the trial not be public? I dont care about Tommy or his political view or history. The reason why Im interested is because Im not a fan of keeping trials secret. Courts are public paid for with tax revenue there for the trials inside them should be public record. Does the public not have a right to know about what goes on in their city/town. Yes you should respect the law of the land you live in. Thats seems to be another problem all together though.</p>

<p>Second, laws are different in different countries. Respect that. Politics are different too. Our right is not your right, it&#39;s just about research. </p>

<p>Courts are publicly paid with tax yes. But too apply that to being a defence of Tommy is dumb. If a drug dealer gets caught once you let him off, twice? Nah. You cannot apply your own law to ours.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Your not answering why the case shouldn&#39;t be public info. The drug dealers would be, wouldnt it? If your a follower of religion then there is a pretty good chance you&#39;ve been lied to. Thats why most religions do their form of confirmation early in life. If they did it later in life the numbers might drop off after people recieve 12 years of education. Im not a hater of religion as many on Reddit are. I think going to church, temple, mosques is more or less just a way to network. Thier are scientists and engineers who go to religious services and then work on ways to blow up the world, save lives, put a person on Mars. Maybe they think that their just working out the details of their chosen God&#39;s magic/power. Im interested in why you think the 3 part trial should have a media blackout. Your right I live in America I am not a British citizen so if I could get your opinion on the trial being silenced, without Tommy being in the reason. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Enough &quot;bad apples&quot; and those bad apples are extremely violent and authoritarian. The Muslims who would get along fine in a peaceful, western society are bullied and guilted by faith into going along with the demands of the bad apples. The problem is there are so many bad apples that it is a risk to any country that takes them in large numbers. </p>

<p>The immigration &quot;crisis&quot; is largely manufactured to take advantage of this. Who are the most likely to be the extremists? Young males. Who makes up 42% of the &quot;refugees&quot; in Europe? Males 18 to 34. Overall 70% of them are males.  </p>

<p>What I&#39;m saying is basically that there is a large enough presence in the Islamic faith of those who use the faith to do bad things. By taking in large numbers of them we are not solving the problem, only importing it, and it is a problem that fundamentally sees any attempt by us to de-radicalize them through assimilation as a betrayal of their faith. </p>

<p>They&#39;re just as violent in their own countries. They are largely ruled by authoritarians and they interpret the West&#39;s way of dealing with legal matters and justice as a weakness. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>While those are great questions I would hesitate to say they&#39;re entirely relevant if we&#39;re discussing the pros and cons of mass importation. If I were a grocer and I got a shipment of bad apples I wouldn&#39;t put them on the shelves of my store and postulate how they got to be bad. I&#39;d send them back to the distributor and tell him to figure it out. Sure, I might be able to sell some of the good apples but stocking the shelves with rotten apples will only harm my business. Then as the worms infect the other produce my store would go out of business until I can&#39;t afford to stay open. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well I kind of started talking about that in my post in regards to the fake immigration crisis but I guess I&#39;m in too many places at once because that wasn&#39;t really the overall topic. I mean more to point out that if there are such large portions of an institution that are using it for nefarious purposes and that portion is violent enough to steer the course of the population as a whole then the whole thing is dangerous until the bad portions are rooted out. The thing about institutional change is it must come from within. The violent followers of Islam are never going to become peaceful from a bunch of kaffirs telling them about their own faith. It&#39;s going to take the peaceful followers to  right the ship. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Nobody is focusing on the Catholic church being infiltrated by pedophiles when there won&#39;t be any Vatican left to worry about saving so long as Europe keeps importing so many people who hate their way of life and European governments are complicit in it. </p>

<p>Let&#39;s say for arguments sake that you&#39;re right that the Quran doesn&#39;t promote pedophilia. The people you need to convince of that aren&#39;t non-Muslims. Nobody is going to care so long as child brides are still rampant amongst it&#39;s followers. For instance, many people dislike Christianity because so many of it&#39;s followers in the past did things like beating up or murdering gay people or whatever you want to call it. Jesus never advocated those things, though. </p>

<p>Warning this is disgusting example</p>

<blockquote>
<p>famous poet Abu Nuwas:</p>

<p>O the joy of sodomy!
So now be sodomites, you Arabs.
Turn not away from it--
therein is wondrous pleasure.
Take some coy lad with kiss-curls
twisting on his temple
and ride as he stands like some gazelle
standing to her mate.
A lad whom all can see girt with sword
and belt not like your whore who has
to go veiled.
Make for smooth-faced boys and do your
very best to mount them, for women are
the mounts of the devils</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is a huge part of the dislike. Kids get sexually abused by our politicians and clergy and sickos but they hide out while Islam says it&#39;s perfectly fine.</p>

<p>Then our soldiers must endure it happening on bases. </p>

<p>The rise in rapes of children have increased drastically wherever Muslim migrants are brought in. The Either an 1400 girls raped and abused and trafficked are just one example.</p>

<p>Tommy Robinson has been trying to bring awareness because people do not know they have such dangers lurking around their children.</p>

<p>The Sikhs organized to combat it but because of so called hate crime statutes they don&#39;t get arrested and harass for it being a protected class.</p>

<p>I guess my question is, where does this hate come from? </p>

<p>I would say a combination of 9/11 (and global Islamist terror back to the 80&#39;s);  media sensationalism and fearmongering; and just straight up propaganda.</p>

<p>Islam has plenty of problems (like Islamists and a variety of extremist sects), but white Christians have committed far more acts of terror on American soil than Muslims. But then white Christians are not the great &quot;Other&quot; we have been conditioned to fear and hate, so no one thinks twice or examines it much further.</p>

<p>That said, it&#39;s pretty widely accepted that Aisha was a kid when she married Muhammad.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>According to Sunni scriptural Hadith sources, Aisha was six or seven years old when she was married to Muhammad with the marriage not being consummated until she had reached the age of nine or ten years old which is interpreted by many observers to indicate that she reached puberty at this age.</p>

If your a follower of religion then there is a pretty good chance you&#39;ve been lied to. Thats why most religions do their form of confirmation early in life. If they did it later in life the numbers might drop off after people recieve 12 years of education. Im not a hater of religion as many on Reddit are. I think going to church, temple, mosques is more or less just a way to network. Thier are scientists and engineers who go to religious services and then work on ways to blow up the world, save lives, put a person on Mars. Maybe they think that their just working out the details of their chosen God&#39;s magic/power. Im interested in why you think the 3 part trial should have a media blackout. Your right I live in America I am not a British citizen so if I could get your opinion on the trial being silenced, without Tommy being in the reason. </p>
