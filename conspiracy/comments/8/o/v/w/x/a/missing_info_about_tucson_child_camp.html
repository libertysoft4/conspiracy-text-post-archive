        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I have been getting caught up on what&#39;s happening in Tucson.  Dove into a lot of posts made over the last few days and came across some info that I really didn&#39;t see anyone discussing.  </p>

<p>I am posting a compilation video I came across which includes a facebook live stream and reveals what all I am sharing.  In it he discusses that yes they are taking everything from the site and putting it on display at &quot;bravo base camp&quot; in Tucson. He invites everyone to come take videos and pictures and spread the info. Something I have not seen anyone else mention. </p>

<p>If you live in the Tucson please go and help document and share what all was found. </p>

<p>Next he mentions several times blue prints that were found at the sites which he claims to be underground sex dungeons to hold children and plans for some sort of underground church to be built. </p>

<p>He also indicated that they had found evidence that there are multiple sites that have not been investigated yet along the I-19 corridor. Obviously these people had money and were not homeless. </p>

<p>He also mentions that at the site they have found a couple of other underground bunkers near the original site. These had not been brought up previously and had not been shared with police because the police were not cooperating and they do not know who to trust.  So they kept that info private until the video. </p>

<p>Another interesting point he mentions is that over 80 pairs of different sized children&#39;s shoes were found. That is a lot of shoes people!!  </p>

<p>Idk just thought that this might be helpful since really all I came across on this sub was a lot of arguing about &quot;rape trees&quot; and arguing not really going anywhere. There is a lot more to this story that hasn&#39;t been revealed yet. </p>

<p>And here come the downvotes...</p>

You see, here in this country, we have what the courts call chain of custody. If that is violated, the case can and will be thrown out. There are exceptions but those strictly apply to law enforcement agencies acting in good faith. They do not in ANY way apply to what these people have done. </p>

<p>I don’t know in what country you live in but here, just being a “vet” doesn’t give you some magical right to do what you want and then try to justify it by saying I’m a vet. If they took ANYTHING from those camps, they screwed up and even broke the law. So good for them. All these pedos will run free now thanks to him and his people. </p>

<p>The only upside is that it seemed no one was going to be punished anyway, so in this case awareness is the best we have. But if there was an ongoing investigation and this team fucked that up, then that should all be punished and imprisoned.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh dear, it seems like you&#39;re not really interested in doing any of the looking on your own and would rather be spoon fed answers. That&#39;s how you run into people who are trying to sell you their story. Anywho, you can&#39;t really expect people to take time out of their day to try to persuade you to their side of the fence. Some people have provided links to videos, images, and things that they believe are connected to what&#39;s going on (i.e. Addresses). It&#39;s up to you how to interpret those bits of circumstantial evidence. If you don&#39;t believe in the trafficking theory, that&#39;s fine.

<p>To <em>post</em> is to express a thought.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Anywho, you can&#39;t really expect people to take time out of their day to try to persuade you to their side of the fence.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It&#39;s not about persuasion, though(ironically) a FB live-feed, multiple posts on Reddit, etc... definitely qualify as attempts at persuasion.</p>

<p>Tonight, we should ask ourselves, what is a thought. Is it an amalgam of unrelated things that could be interpreted in multiple ways and which seem like ideas? Or is a thought a cohesive, linear, fully formed idea that that is self supporting and unimpeachable?</p>

<p>So, the next time you would like to express a thought about any old thing, remember the above and don&#39;t expect your audience to accept any less.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Well, all thinking people should be skeptical by their very nature. It is a defining trait of the homosapien.</p>

Give me three good reasons for very strange leather straps to be tied to trees in a camp filled with porn, lube, kids underwear, a bunker an adult wouldn’t fit in unless they were pretty fucking small, hair dye, a bloody knife, random people trying to get BACK into the camp to dig up stuff they’d left behind, weird straps on trees that make no sense for animal tying- with blood on them. What animals have two appendages that need tied up like that?  Unless there’s some kinda monkey smuggling operation going on....</p>

<p>Humans. It’s humans. And the cartels and the government are treating them like nothing. Just more pawns in their sick twisted games. </p>

He&#39;s just inventing things that he thinks are part of some rape/torture ring when they&#39;re clearly not.

<p>So, good. Just looking at it logically, it seems like no one was raped there. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t think some or most people realize how easy and common it is for local media and law enforcement to simply spin or ignore what could be a potential massive story.
I have seen it happen locally dozens of times. A student dies from hazing at a prominent local university. The frat members clearly responsible get 100% cleared because several of them have prominent fathers in office. County Police help with the initial cover up, all the local media plays along because it&#39;s a football school and their simply repeating whatever the law enforcement public relations office tells them to repeat. No one with local newspapers or television is doing any actual digging or investigating. They are parrots nothing more.
That&#39;s essentially a low level thing that&#39;s easily covered up. Something much more sinister would quickly be managed by the local PR much faster and efficiently. </p>

<p>No one wants it to be true, but if it is we want justice to come out from it.  we don&#39;t want it swept under the rug, covered up, and forgotten about.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So if this is true (which in my eyes it obviously is) why are we just finding these camps? I lived in Arizona all my life and I know some areas of the desert don&#39;t really get much traffic, but he had a video stating the homeless stay 300 yards or feet (can&#39;t recall which one) away because that&#39;s the &quot;cartel&quot; side. How is it just now making media? Is it because people rather listen to a patriot then some nobody and that&#39;s what it took to get headlines? I know the cops are paid off, but what about the citizens that came across these camps. That had to be hundreds if not thousands of people so how did they shut all of them up? They couldn&#39;t have killed all of them without raising red flags and if they paid them off then of course they know it&#39;s real sex camps and they wouldn&#39;t want normal citizens carrying that information. Which leads me to the question of why now? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>To those who understand the meaning of these words :
The WHOLE TREE IS BAD where I am at ( Bobby Kennedy called where I grew up “ the most corrupt county in America”)
There were underground tunnels in my church/school as a child / along with using evasive tech on us -
There were literally Dirt Holes that went nearly miles to houses in the surrounding areas as well as a church a block away -children would be in the school one minute and then seen walking from the woods or a house over blocks away -THIS IS OLD SCHOOL SLOP ! Where I endured stuff like this. the “killings” where usually homeless adults or debtors (drugs or whatever)to get us to behave - I CAN CARE LESS THAT THIS IS RED saturnalia &amp; I am sick of peoples telling me to post on the Chans !!!
It has become much more sufficiently sophisticated where I come  from - SADLY ; THAT MEANS that this crap is  NEARLY IN THE OPEN ! And now that they’ve taken nearly everything dear to me - I feel I must try to be as openly frank as possible. [Im new to the whole social-engineering-experiment-but the Cue cards sucked me in and I felt that this was finally my time / yet w/ my conditioning and life experience I have no idea anymore if EVERYTHING happening here ON THE “ Web “is “ to justify the means “in America we have been under Martial Rule !! I PRAY YOU KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS!!! That’s easily proven- this patriot crap hasn’t truly existed since before the last Civil War !!! / shoot the messenger all you want I’m used to it ! Just please THINK CRITICALLY ]
There are tons of public officials who’ve been charged &amp; are running churches or in government here .Who do you go to when you’ve already been black-listed for asked no questions -not that there aren’t good people in government! It’s just that here ; they just have been put in job positions that are best for them to make sure the money flows into bonds to build more court houses !!! I can elaborate on this...... regardless 
WILL YOU PEOPLE CHECK OUT YOUR LOCAL CEMEX PLANT ? 
WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IF IT WAS CROSSED W/ THE USE OF THE STAVIA DATA TRACKER?
WILL YOU FIND WHAT I DID ?
Nevertheless I am high speculative of all of this ?
Sorry I was conditioned for a total societal collapse before 2020 w/ when the world discovers
 “ what we do “ . Which were some of the mottos I was hammered w/ daily  by nuns- yes it was being openly operated by several catholic organizations - it closed shop in the 80’s &amp; moved across the street -( the only thing close to the operation that I survived that’s been declassified was MKSEARCH ) my debriefing lasted years as far as I know it’s never stopped &amp; now the people who went through the entire process are running the show here . In my opinion- Sincerely Lost with no hope ,Dada</p>

<p>Nice astroturfing. Clintons are part of the swamp. Trump is no saint, but he definitely isn&#39;t swamp. He is working with white hats and exposing deep state. </p>

<p>To jump the immediate conclusion that this was a &quot;CHILD RAPE CAMP RUN BY SOROS AND THE ROTHSCHILDS&quot; is so so dumb. A bunch of misinformed internet sleuths connecting dots that aren&#39;t there.  </p>

<p>And the VOP guys, they keep making a bunch of outlandish claims but literally back none of it up with video or photographic evidence. This dude has been live streaming for DAYS and we get no quality video of any of this?

<p>Absolutely!  And sadly there is a chance it won&#39;t get the real investigation it deserves because of nuttyass claims.</p>

<p>This reminds me SO MUCH of Pizzagate.  There were definitely some kernels of weirdness that warranted exploration, but the nuts quickly came in and muddied the water so much the entire thing quickly became a joke.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Another thing I wanted to point out that I really have not heard anyone else mention is the fact that this supposed homeless camp had a $10,000 septic tank that was buried in the ground in the middle of nowhere. These homeless people would have had to save up to years panhandling and then paid to have shipped in the middle of nowhere. No way they were homeless they def had money to spend on things. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have seen some crazy set ups for sure. No one living in a septic tank buried in the ground though. Probably not looking hard enough?  Why go through all that trouble when you could have a tent.   They def don&#39;t need 80 pairs of kids shoes.  I am sure you know that you can get an rv in the NW pretty cheap so why buy an expensive, hot ass septic tank to live in? People on site are claiming some of that stuff had have been there for years. No one in there right mind would live in a hot ass, unventilated septic tank in the desert for years.  That makes no sense.</p>

<p>But let&#39;s say that you are right and it was a homeless camp. Some kid was still living in a septic tank in the desert and at the very least and that child was not being treated properly. CPS should be involved at minimum. No kid should be living that way ever. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree that it is weird they aren&#39;t really sharing everything they are claiming.  The only thing I can come up with is that they are being cautious about things.  These guys were military and have a love for this country. It makes sense that they would initially keep things under wrap until the authorities came to investigate. I am sure some key things were given to police to help but now that they are not gaining traction and claims of no evidence all over the news they seem to have given up on them and handling things themselves.  Everything I am seeing these guys were genuinely freaked out by this place and still are and have shifted to finding these people and uncovering what all they stumbled upon. Hopefully once things start to settle down they can present some more facts.  I don&#39;t thing people would just be showing up to volunteer if this was all nothing. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Just because they haven&#39;t been licensed to use the word veterans to collect donations doesn&#39;t mean they aren&#39;t veterans. Other veterans take stealing valor very seriously. I actually date a veteran and she takes it to heart. Any time a homeless person claims to be a vet to get money she quizzes the hell out of them s asks them what their MO was, Where they were stationed, etc...  If they try and bullshit her on that she will make the person very sorry. I have seen her pull this 3 Times each time it ended with the person apologizing profusely.  If these guys are faking being veterans they will be sorry for sure but I highly doubt it as his mannerrism and the way he talks is just like someone who has been in the military. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I live here in Tucson born &amp; raised. I’ve been following this story ever since the camp was discovered. A group of vets go around town searching for vets and homeless camps to help get them off the streets. They stumbled upon this place and immediately knew something was different due to the pornography, kids shoes, ties on the trees, a bloody knife, and much more. And don’t worry everyone knows about the septic tank and are definitely focused on it. Investigators are saying it could’ve been used to hold children. It’s all so sick.</p>

Everything you listed either has not been shown or can have other uses other than jumping straight to child sex trafficking<br/>
Is it possible? Absolutely<br/>
Have we seen solid evidence to show us any actual connection to trafficking?  No  </p>

<p>if the people pushing this so hard were not the ones who recently got exposed for trying to run another psyop, and this is basically trying to use the same psychology, I&#39;m going to let the cops handle this and not people who I already do not trust  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ll trust those cops over people who have already tried to (and succeeded to a degree) decieve people.<br/>
As of this point those specific cops have not to my knowledge attempted to deceive us, and until they do, I&#39;ll give them more trust than the others  </p>

<p>What evidence would satisfy me?<br/>
I hadn&#39;t thought about that honestly, umm, for the sex part, probably some sort of DNA which would need to be lab tested to see if there is a match at all, but if there was used condoms or something to that degree<br/>
I wouldn&#39;t automatically jump to it being sex with minors even with that though honestly, if there was child pornography, that would definitely make me consider it a possibility  </p>

<p>For trafficking it would take a lot, most likely it would take video, audio or some sort of documentation evidence.   </p>

<p>There&#39;s probably stuff I&#39;m missing but I&#39;m happy to look at all evidence (I&#39;ve watched as many videos as I&#39;ve been able to find) people have if they want to link it  </p>

<p>First, I don&#39;t think it&#39;s smart to assume anything, Espcially something to this degree<br/>
Now, I never said nothing nefarious was going on there, please don&#39;t put words in my mouth<br/>
I have said that as of yet, I have seen no evidence that shows child sex trafficking  </p>

<p>I have already said it is possible, I just think it&#39;s smart to rely on evidence rather than emotion and assumptions </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m definitely one of the open-minded people on this sub and I tried looking at some of this stuff yesterday, but it&#39;s all over the place. Not sure if the people trying to make everyone more aware are not aware themselves, but people on the internet hate videos. Especially if they video does not cut right to the chase. If they have to sit through more than half a second of anything interesting they&#39;re going to change the channel. So pictures please. (And please don&#39;t link from crazy.com, put it somewhere I wouldn&#39;t be afraid to put my click in.)</p>

<p>Is there any way we could get a concise, organized explanation of who/what/when/where here, perhaps in another post? And with clear pictures of the evidence.</p>

<p>Who is this group/person? I don&#39;t need a cop or a scientist at a podium, it can be a dude with a camera. But it can&#39;t be a dude with a camera who&#39;s lied to us before or stands to profit from BSing. Also, who owns it or who&#39;s been there recently? I have a feeling that if people with investigatory experience were involved from the get-go, they could have gone around and tried to collect as many hair samples as possible or something for identifying victims/traffickers/witnesses, but instead it sounds like lots of people have come in and more or less ruined that opportunity. But maybe not? Who owns it? What do they usually do there? Is it weird that they own it or do they own lots of other similar properties and has anyone poked around those for similar setups there before they can cover their tracks?</p>

<p>What did they find? Pictures. Explanations. Please hold back from extrapolating basic things into outlandish ones, if there are a couple of solidly damning things, don&#39;t even mention the other eight sorta normal things that <em>could</em> be something crazy. You just muddy the water and create doubt. You don&#39;t have a PR or a marketing team, you have to be your own PR/marketing team and recognize the strongest points and the weakest ones. In the same way that the media can downplay a story by only highlighting the trivial things, we can sow the seeds of our own destruction by emphasizing too much weak evidence too strongly. They just need a reason, any reason to doubt something they already don&#39;t want to believe.</p>

<p>When did the events occur? From the map it looked like there was a neighborhood across the freeway. Have any of those people been asked if there&#39;s been any activity on that other side in the last week/month/year? There have been mentions of the police being notified and stopping by already/others saying that ignored them - it would be interesting to see a timeline of these events with statements/articles/police reports showing a clear rundown so we&#39;re not having to just rely on a few people.</p>

<p>Where exactly is this? I guess I really mean, why was this place chosen? Where did the kids go? Where did the come from? (fuck off cotton eyed joe) Was there some sort of industrial operation nearby or trade show or event, short or long term, that happened at the time the children are suspected of being there that would explain them being there? </p>

<p>Don&#39;t hookers flood to Super Bowls and World Cups? So wouldn&#39;t child sex traffickers flock to places where their services are needed, but on a smaller scale? So what if this was a stockyards of sorts, a temporary holding point for a Taken-like sex camp that moved along with some drilling crews or a Taken-like auction of kids to foreign princes?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So the police investigators said this is nothing. Judging by the videos, it&#39;s nothing. He&#39;s just inventing things that he thinks are part of some rape/torture ring when they&#39;re clearly not. Straps on the trees that he claims are rape ropes are clearly being used to hold their shelters together.</p>

<p>So, good. Just looking at it logically, it seems like no one was raped there. </p>

<p>So my question is, why do you so desperately <em>want</em> this to be true. What is there to gain by trying to convince everyone this is true when all evidence says that it is not?</p>

<p>I think anyone with reading comprehension can take that as &quot;boy I can&#39;t wait until all those skeptics are proven wrong,&quot; which, is kind of fucked up since you would think one would say &quot;Boy I hope all the skeptics are right, I don&#39;t want to be right about this.&quot;</p>

<p>The dude is hoping for raped children for the sake of triggered skeptics.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Child sex camp with tunnels to the local casino with pedophile symbolism. The camp is located on property owned by CEMEX cement company. It is on the border of mexico. CEMEX is owned by Soros and the Rothschilds. CEMEX makes donations to the clinton foundation. CEMEX has had building contracts in Haiti, which is a known hot bed for child trafficking. This is going to be the biggest sex trafficking and pedophile exposure of the most powerful people the world has ever seen.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh boy. Another &quot;the billionaire will save us&quot; delusional mouthpiece.

<p>The man is extremely suspicious. Condoning his behavior because you like good politics is disgusting.</p>

<p>Nice astroturfing. Clintons are part of the swamp. Trump is no saint, but he definitely isn&#39;t swamp. He is working with white hats and exposing deep state. </p>

<p>His history with Miss Teen and Miss USA would suggest otherwise. His obsession with his young daughter would suggest otherwise. His circle of friends (the Clintons, gasp!) would suggest otherwise.</p>
