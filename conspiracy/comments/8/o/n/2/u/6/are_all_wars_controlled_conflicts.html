        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Something I’ve realized from studying the history of war is that oftentimes you find the same countries of factions funding/supporting BOTH sides. Now I’m not saying I necessarily believe every war is a controlled conflict. Perhaps some of them do happen organically. But if you look at many of the major wars such as WW1, WW2, the Iran-Iraq War, you find they are orchestrated on both sides at the top levels by the same powerful people. The same can be said for smaller wars such as Israel-Hamas conflict or the Northern Ireland conflict. It was quite eye-opening to realize how Israel in fact created Hamas or how Britain has been manipulating and pulling the strings behind Sinn Fein/ the IRA all along.</p>

<p>Which leads me to my question: are all these wars basically engineered conflicts where people in power pit two sides against each other to advance their agenda? Are wars essentially just large-scale false flags? Consider for example the Iraq War and the subsequent War on ISIS. The US takes out Saddam and then ISIS emerges from the power vacuum. It’s already heavily suspected that the US covertly created and funds ISIS. So now you have the US-backed Iraqi forces fighting against... US-backed ISIS. I mean just think of all the thousands of people killed in this war and the millions that are displaced... And it just leads me to the idea that whoever is orchestrating these wars are complete psychopaths. </p>

<p>Now I even wonder about Syria and whether that war is not in fact being controlled on both sides. How we know that the entire US-Russia conflict as well as its many proxy wars are not also engineered and manipulated at the top by the same people?</p>

<p>Here’s another related question: how would you ever know the difference? You can’t trust the media, you can’t trust first-hand eyewitness reports (which mostly come via the media) so unless you’re right there, in the thick of it, what can you really verify to be “true”?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Excellent post.</p>

<p>Of course, we have been raised to believe that if we simply parrot what we are told by authority, then we &#39;know&#39;, we are &#39;smart&#39;.</p>

<p>Thus we are raised and conditioned by school to be arrogant and conceited as a matter of course.</p>

<p>What do I mean by this?</p>

<p>Imagine how full of oneself one must be to believe they &#39;know&#39; what is happening on the other side of the world.</p>

<p>Well, most people -- normies AND truthers -- believe they &#39;know&#39; so much.</p>

<p>The reality is, we know jack shit about what what is happening on the other side of the world.</p>

<p>It takes true humility to be able to accept this, after a lifetime of believing and parroting lies.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Seriously, aside from grainy videos, loose translations and trusting whoever is hosting a video or report to be honest, there isn&#39;t a whole lot of fact to go on. </p>

<p>Even casualty numbers are often manipulated on both sides to give the impression they won and the other side suffered heavy losses. Syria/Iraq could just be a huge honeypot to reduce the middle eastern population to help manage the water crisis there. Various &#39;rebel groups&#39; could just be CIA/Mossad getting young, impressionable and desperate kids to go die or stir up enough shit to justify an Israeli/allied invasion. Hell even some of the awesome battle stories we hear could be whipped up by some Tom Clancy clone to feed our pride a little. </p>

<p>Point is, only an ignoramus really thinks they know what is going on in these various wars. Wars can organically happen, but always remember the rich are closer to each other than they are their own country men. However a war starts, the elites will make sure they profit from it whichever side. </p>

<p>What if the wars are fake?</p>

<p>This is what Orwell <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ad1iCYcdyiM">tried to explain</a> in 1984, but people are either too lazy to read the book, or too stupid to understand Orwell&#39;s allegories.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I know we&#39;ve disagreed in the past but I definitely agree they could all be arranged or faked in a way. I think some conflicts happen amongst tribes and then the powers that be use it to their advantage to pick up natural resources or what have you.</p>

<p>Upon my reread of 1984 a couple years I certainly sat down and reflected on not only all the bs back to the Gulf of Tonkin resolution, but even most of the wars back to Napoleon and beyond could have been arranged for certain people&#39;s benefits. It&#39;s a disgusting thought but one we must entertain with seriousness. The elites want us to be scared, and rife with anger towards other people so there&#39;s always the appearance of doom on the horizon. </p>

<p>Many of the perpetrators are long gone but if we can expose the fraud behind many of our wars then hopefully we can find some sort of peace.  The reality is, especially after traveling a bit, that people aren&#39;t really that different, except the way cultures structure their societies, and where they place priorities. If that doesn&#39;t interfere with your nations way of life, it shouldn&#39;t matter unless it&#39;s evil as fuck. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This x 1000</p>

<p>Wars are expensive. Countries don’t tend to find them out of money they have already - they take loans. From banks. Who are often there already, funding the other side in their eternal Hegelian shitshow of wealth consolidation. The Rothschilds control the central banks , who themselves are aligned with the British oligarchy, centred around the Crown.</p>

<p>People really ought to look further than the last election cycle to see how far back the conspiracy against us has been waged-</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Are you talking about General MacArthur? Truman relieved him because they were trying to keep Korea a &quot;limited war.&quot; Definitely very odd. It&#39;s become more apparent to me that wars are often an end in themselves. Opportunities to end a war are turned down in favor of prolonging it. Consider for example the Troubles, a war that lasted three decades. Why is it that Gerry Adams and Martin McGuinness, the two top IRA men, were never taken out during this period? It&#39;s pretty clear to me both of these men were protected British intelligence assets. Then when a certain wing of the IRA, the East Tyrone Brigade, tries to break away from the Provos, they are totally wiped out by the SAS.</p>

<p>Back to Korea. My grandpa was a Marine who was in the mortar company. His best friend was killed when he was blown apart by a defunct mortar. Something I found really strange when he told me the story was how the mortar round was apparently Chinese manufactured. So you&#39;re telling me a Marine is blown up by a mortar round manufactured by the Chinese... in a war against the Chinese? Not necessarily saying there is any conspiracy there, but I found that detail very strange.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>After some reading I&#39;d say it must&#39;ve been MacArthur, yeah. Now I&#39;m for the life of am trying to find out whether I have the analysis of the oddities boomarked amongst all my other unorganized bookmarked links.</p>

<p>That&#39;s interesting about those IRA figures. Will have to look into that later. </p>

<p>I suppose the explanation for that Chinese round could range from something as harmless (no pun intended) as captured ammunition to <em>insert detailed explanation of war profiteering for manufacturers in both countries with no regard to national loyalty here.</em></p>

<p>Thanks for sharing. Would not be suprised if it turned out the British had interests in accomodating and inciting armed resistance such as IRA at this point, just based on the playbook alone. Learning about Operation Gladio was increasingly eye opening. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Seriously, aside from grainy videos, loose translations and trusting whoever is hosting a video or report to be honest, there isn&#39;t a whole lot of fact to go on. </p>

<p>Even casualty numbers are often manipulated on both sides to give the impression they won and the other side suffered heavy losses. Syria/Iraq could just be a huge honeypot to reduce the middle eastern population to help manage the water crisis there. Various &#39;rebel groups&#39; could just be CIA/Mossad getting young, impressionable and desperate kids to go die or stir up enough shit to justify an Israeli/allied invasion. Hell even some of the awesome battle stories we hear could be whipped up by some Tom Clancy clone to feed our pride a little. </p>

<p>Point is, only an ignoramus really thinks they know what is going on in these various wars. Wars can organically happen, but always remember the rich are closer to each other than they are their own country men. However a war starts, the elites will make sure they profit from it whichever side. </p>
