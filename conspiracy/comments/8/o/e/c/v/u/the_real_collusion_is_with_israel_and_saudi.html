<p>We are over a year into this &quot;Russian Collusion&quot; investigation and what have we found? Meanwhile, Saudi Arabia and Israel are getting everything they want from the US government and no one seems to care. Isn&#39;t that the real collusion? This link points that out and highlights the specific facts of the matter.</p>

My guess is a Qatari is holding Gazprom shares in escrow for Trump until he can fufill his purpose and lift sanctions off Russia.

<p>indictments of Twitter bots with no demonstrated ties to the Kremlin </p>

<p>More like indictments of various campaign officials, the NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISOR and one of Trump&#39;s most trusted advisors, the president&#39;s former campaign chair, his lawyer&#39;s office got raided, his own SON&#39;s email show collusion with Wikileaks and his own SON admitted to meeting Russian&#39;s for &quot;dirt on hillary Clinton&quot;... You know, that same shit the whole organization is being criminally investigated for.</p>

<p>The inability of some users here to piece together this toddler-level puzzle of criminal activity and collusion.... While somehow touting their ability to solve a 4D puzzle made of out-of-this-world satanic, pedophile cult connections is astounding.... Or it just shows the underpinnings of a massive pro-trump shill campaign being leveled against the users of this sub and the greater internet. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Trump was bought by the Zionist cabal long ago when Rothschild inc. bailed him out in the late 80s.  he&#39;s even brought their operative, Wilbur Ross in to run the U.S. economy.</p>

<p>it&#39;s not even about the highest bidder, the Zionist infiltration of U.S. politics is absolute and to the core and anyone who sits in the president&#39;s chair is gonna end up doing their bidding.  that is a fact we&#39;ve seen play out consistently since the days that JFK tried to force their lobbies to register as foreign entities and to compare the strangle hold these Zionists have over America to anything the Russians would ever be capable of is hilarious.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>oh because they&#39;re foreign operatives, i get why it&#39;s supposed to be important.  except it had zero influence on the election outcome and their ties to the Kremlin are not substantiated.  even if they were proven ties between them and the Kremlin, then what? i&#39;m supposed to believe the best they can do is a Twitter farm that accomplished nothing? lol, k.  meanwhile Israel has us fighting its wars for decades on end, but RUSSIAN COLLUSION!!</p>

<p>indictments of a few candy assed Twitter bots aren&#39;t proof of anything here other than a state agenda to blame everything on Russia meanwhile the real foreign subversion from the Ziogang is waaaayy off the average person&#39;s radar.  it&#39;s a blatant psyop.  would you like to source up with anything that shows otherwise? i asked because i&#39;m interested, but the the usual thing is no one ever actually does that and when they do it&#39;s some lame sensationalist spin from a mainstream news outlet that doesn&#39;t confirm much of anything.</p>
