        <p><span class="badge badge-primary">1</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;2018-06-04 by <a class="author" href="../../../../../../../../user/whatevawhatevvathroa.html">whatevawhatevvathroa</a></p>
        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>VOP has been talking about this on their FB page for 3 or 4 days now. </p>

<p>At least one local Tucson news station did a story on it like a day or two after the started posting. [here](tucsonnewsnow.com/story/38322543/vet-group-discovers-disturbing-abandoned-camp). </p>

<p>The article says police have alread been out to investigate and write a report. </p>

<p>They also did a broadcast of the story and took video and shit of all the areas being talked about and it seems pretty obvious that there is no cover up here and the reporters are just treading lightly. </p>

<p>All of these guys&#39; accusations are based on hearsay right now. No news station wants to broadcast a story saying there is a child sex trafficking ring being run out of a place, only to discover later that they were wrong, so right now they are just referring to it as a &quot;disturbing abandoned camp.&quot; </p>

<p>You can watch the broadcast they did it on <a href="https://linx.li/z0gvyrpp.mp4">here</a>, the guys who found the camp were right to contact the authorities, but imo they seem to be blowing this way out of proportion before having a real grasp on the situation. </p>

<p>As for OP. u/holyhitmann, has a 2 year old account with 9,000 karma completely scrubbed up until the last two months. He&#39;s completely cleaned out his last two years of activity. </p>

<p>Of the four submissions still visible on his profile, the oldest one is <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/8o6h3w/breaking_hawaiian_judge_over_rules_trumps_new/">this 22 hour old post to r/the_donald</a></p>

<p>Similarly, the oldest comments on his account are <em>two</em> two month old comments, and one 22 hour old comment (in the 22 hour old submission he made). Other than that, every comment/submission still visible on his profile has been made in the last 5 hours. </p>

<p>First, 4 hours ago in r/the_donald: <a href="http://archive.is/GNT4u">BREAKING: Child Sex Trafficking Camp Discovered Outside of Tucson - ACTIVE COVERUP UNDERWAY</a>, wherein OP posts pretty much the same thing he did here, minus the r/the_donald &quot;coverup&quot; part. Ok, so first off this isn&#39;t BREAKING news. The article I Linked up above is dated June 1st, Friday. Two days ago. And the VOP gus have been posting about it since at least May 30th. </p>

<p>OP&#39;s post is an ecstatic tirade, topped of with some rothscild and clinton screenshots at the end, and the holy grail of them all, the screenshot of a map where the words &quot;CHILD SEX CAMP&quot; have been dutifully <a href="https://archive.is/o/GNT4u/https://i.imgur.com/24zafhC.jpg">superimposed over the area in question</a>.</p>

<p>So mods, remove that post, and from the wording it appears that they removed one prior submission concerning the same topic by u/holyhitmann as well. </p>

<p>Less than an hour later, OP tries to spice it up a little: <a href="http://archive.is/F0rbX">BREAKING: Child Sex Trafficking Camp Discovered Outside of Tucson - Authorities NOT cooperating - GIANT underground tunnel to Mexico, bloody weapons, children&#39;s clothes and items, log books documenting sold children ALL FOUND - LINKS TO CLINTON FOUNDATION! ACTIVE COVERUP GET IN HERE</a></p>

<p>None of the things he described in the post title have are true. log books documenting sold children? Tunnel to Mexico? Where? <a href="https://linx.li/selif/0zrntj2n.jpg">I think i found it!!</a> </p>

<p>And of course,  LINKS TO THE CLINTON FOUNDATION GET IN HERE!!!!!!</p>

<p>Of course the mods removed this liars bullshit posts.</p>

<p>u/hitmann is a TMOR user trying to pull a fast one on the r/the_donald, but it didn&#39;t work, so he came here to try and get us instead, while at the same time trolling r/the_donald users by spreading this &quot;T_D mods complicit in child sex trafficking cover up&quot; narrative.</p>

<p>This isn&#39;t to say that the site the VOP guys found definitely wasn&#39;t being used by sex traffickers, but u/hitmann is definitely a lying sack of shit. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>So far it is looking to me like a lot of this story is bubbling up out of the chans. Yes there was a news story and video out some Tucson TV station, but the chans seem to be most of the source of &#39;information&#39; so far; 8chan /great awakening/ and both of the /pols/. Starting to spread around twitter too.</p>

<p>I need to see better information than that. Just because rumor, gossip, and conjecture are widespread doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s the truth.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So basically, there is a camp found by some militia group who assume it to be a child trafficking site and the far right propagandists step in and start spreading fake news of a Clinton connection to it? The camp looks pretty strange, but no one has any proof that it was used to smuggle or hold children. Will be interesting to see how this plays out. </p>

<p>I saw a Little Tikes play kitchen and some ratty toys on the ground. Obviously the swing. In a recent Reddit user video on GA, I also saw a child&#39;s carseat that is for 30 lbs and under. It looks horrible. I don&#39;t want to link here. It is available in that sub.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>At this point there are over a dozen videos on the group’s <a href="https://m.facebook.com/VOP-Alpha-Co-Team-Pulaski-1415347948612114/videos/?ref=page_internal&amp;amp;mt_nav=1">FB page.</a> </p>

<p>The videos display a lot of things like kids’ toys, play furniture, shoes, underwear, and in one “tour” video with not the main guy but a lady vet it looked like there was a supply of Benadryl and Lidocaine. A bloodied knife was found in loose soil. Apparently after the initial arrests the police department sent a unit to investigate and a cadaver dog is in the process of being ordered.</p>

<p>I delete my post history....</p>

<p>Nothing else you said makes me a liar? I posted links from every where else.  No info came from me.  Clinton foundation is donated to by cemex, the company who owns the land.  </p>

<p>Also,  to fit your narrative, you got my posts backwards. The second post came first,  and visa versa. Which is why the real second one is so toned down,  i war trying to not get it removed. </p>

<p>Good job tin foil hat man. You wasted a shit ton of your day on me and were wrong about every bit of it lol......just posting some news coming from my town that nobody was talking about</p>

    <div class="md"><p>good info today, don&#39;t be a stranger </p>

<p>search &#39;mindhawk arizona child services&#39; and you will find my steemit post with archive links that prove child services is turning a blind eye to trafficking in arizona, i also investigated Lori Handrahan and found her story to be true and frightening.  </p>

<p>Something is going on where elites disappearing children, there is too much evidence and I didn&#39;t sign up for a society where children are food for demented people with too much money.  </p>

<p>lmk and ill look at anything you post</p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot; No news station wants to broadcast a story saying there is a child sex trafficking ring being run out of a place, only to discover later that they were wrong &quot;<br/>
Yeah, news dont have that problem for a lot of stories and oppinions and still report them. They are scared, not cautious.</p>
