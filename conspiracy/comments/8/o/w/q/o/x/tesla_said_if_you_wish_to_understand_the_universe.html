Most of these I discovered through this subteddit so be kind with the thought process. Lol. If Einstein was asked what it feels to be the most intelligent man on the planet and he said &quot;I don&#39;t know ask Nicola Tesla&quot; and Tesla was quoted as saying &quot;if you wish to understand the universe, think of energy frequency and vibrations&quot; what is making the frequencies and vibrations that form galaxies and their shapes? What started this was the resonance plates with sand on top that&#39;s shaped by the Hrtz going through the plate. Here&#39;s an example link: <a href="https://youtu.be/wvJAgrUBF4w">YouTube</a>. This is on the micro level. The macro level would be on the galactic level. Add to this my layman&#39;s understanding of complex physics in how observation is directly linked to the outcome of atomic and subatomic particles actions. If my observation can effect subatomic particles and frequencies then, again, what&#39;s effecting galaxies shape and formation on the macro level? Any input would be fascinating. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Let me connect it for you in a very comprehensible way. Imagine the nucleus of one atom and the first electron surrounding it. The nucleus of the atom, if it was the size of a pea is in the middle of a football stadium. The first electron would likely by at the outermost seats. Everything in between is vacuum or unknown to us.
Now imagine we live in a solar system in which planets orbit the sun, quite like electrons orbiting the nucleus with nothing in between . We go one level up and see solar systems orbiting the core of a galaxy. You see where this is headed? Next we have multiple galaxies forming a cluster and so on...What is Micro and macro cosm is relative to your point of observation. Some larger consciousness for which we form the cells might see us as microcosm and wonder just the same about your question. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree fully. And good descriptive btw. Now for the nitty gritty. Through our understanding from an &#39;awakened&#39; point of view (whatever u wanna consider as awakened) how can we understand a larger consciousness from a microcosmic point of view? How can we see and understand how this larger consciousness effects it&#39;s environment on that scale. If u read the other threads some have put out very interesting ideas. Microtubules. The combined consciousness of all as one making a larger consciousness etc. any ideas? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah but all that does is trigger certain areas in the brain I believe it using ultrasound </p>

<p>Consciousness is nonlocalized, meaning it can exist independently from the brain (science has caught up to this yet) and this has been known by all the Enlightenment traditions for thousands of years now.</p>

<p>So consciousness itself has a very specific signature frequency, but the only ones who probably know what this is DARPA secret OPS</p>

<p>to science it isn&#39;t, to the enlightenment traditions it is.

<p>I wonder if the ancient civilizations were working on that?</p>

<p>I can&#39;t find it right now but I&#39;ve saw a video of a guy claiming an OBE while he was taking a tour of the great pyramid. The tour guide hit a gong that was in either the King&#39;s or Queen&#39;s Chamber to show how amazing the acoustics were and he had a &quot;white out.&quot;  </p>

<p>He said he had the OBE and was instantly outside the pyramid. He was talking with Thoth and other beings he didn&#39;t know the names of until the gong stopped resonating. Then he was back inside the Chamber like nothing happened. </p>

<p>Interesting story.</p>

<p>Yeah I read about this at malta before, and for a little while was on a mission and did get a tone generator and meditated with 111Hz but never really got much out of it.</p>

<p>I think you need to be in a room with surround sound and the proper architecture for the room to resonate properly for this to do what its supposed to do.</p>

<p>Also, I&#39;m not sure 111 is the frequency of consciousness itself</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Boom! That&#39;s what I&#39;m talking about right there and it perfectly describes the theory that I have. In this case, the Gong frequency + the frequency of the Chamber = Induction of OBE.</p>

<p>Now to recreate something like this would be really hard, because even if you have the exact freq of the gong and the room, you would need the chamber/room itself to be built specifically so that everything is resonating in the same way as the chamber.</p>

<p>Anyhow, I have had OBE&#39;s and have talked to beings in that realm that have told me the future is bright and we will have an enlightened society with spirituality machines that wake people up from the slumber. I saw exactly this kind of resonance machine with lasers, lights, frequencies, etc that wakes each person up to higher consciousness, but sadly was shown it wouldn&#39;t be in my life time and not on this planet until some global wars and massive changes, and at a time when Humans have colonized other planets.</p>

<p>About 3 years after I had that talk with the light being in OBE realms, I then saw this, and was like &quot;Holy Shit its realm its coming!&quot;:</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Fascinating stuff. I need one of those LED machines, right now. </p>

<p>Agreed about needing the entire room resonating. That makes more sense, to me at least. I doubt a pair of ear buds are gonna get the job done.. lol</p>

<p>As far as 111 goes, your guess is better than mine.  For some reason it was important, I&#39;d love to know why. </p>

<p>I&#39;ve seen it theorized that the individual blocks on the pyramids have been tuned to a specific frequency as well. Particularly the blocks that have these nubs on them for no apparent reason.. <a href="https://goo.gl/images/PumQFA">here</a> on the bottom right you can see 2 nubs (no idea what they are actually called). This could get the entire pyramid resonating for whatever reason they had. I haven&#39;t seen anymore info on that  topic unfortunately.  I have seen those nubs at other open air megalithic sites as well, so that theory might be totally wrong.</p>

<p>There are people that think initiates into the mystery schools had to get into one of those massive granite &quot;coffins&quot; for a night while chanting/drumming took place. This would make the entire room resonate, especially the guy in the box. So you really could be on to something with your theory.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve seen monotonic gold get laughed at before on this sub but the ancient Egyptians seemed to be obsessed with it.  They would eat these little cakes made out of the stuff. I mention it because they believed that it fed their &quot;light body.&quot;  When people take it it is supposed to sync both hemispheres of your brain and get it working in harmony.  I&#39;m wondering if that was consumed along with the correct frequency resonating around and through you if that gave the desired outcome?  I&#39;d try right now if I could.  Just a random thought..</p>

<p>I&#39;d love it if your OBE info was right and wrong. Right about everything except the timeframe and planet.  Would be amazing to see something like that happening soon..</p>

    <div class="md"><p>In a way I guess. Think of looking at a single frequency and how it interacts with other frequencies. Then think of a whole orchestra and how it would interact with a single frequency or another orchestra. The  make ups of an atom as far as we know starts with a harmonic triplet. Then a harmonic triplet of harmonic triplets and just goes out like a fractal. You can think of each atom as a little symphony held together by their complex harmonic resonances.  And it just goes out fractally, bigger and more complex from their.  </p>

<p>If you go all the way small to quantum chromodynamics they call them &quot;color charge&quot; particles of red, green, blue. Kind of like how you can make multiple colors on a TV using just RGB pixels.  But instead of thinking in terms of pixels think in terms of harmonic triplets.  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color_charge">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color_charge</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>That is a super cool picture. I&#39;ve had a couple of OBE&#39;s that i believe were a direct effect of NDE&#39;s in which I was abusing pretty hardcore substances in my early 20&#39;s. In those OBE&#39;s I can remember vividly being concious, but having zero attachments to the physical world. (Side note I remember feeling like my spirit, or I, was under attack but had a feeling that i was protected or that everything would be ok)
The reason Im saying this though, is because during the most intense of these exp, I remember being presented with a Fibanocchi spiral but at the time didnt know what that was. All I knew was it induced a feeling in my spirit that i was acending VERY rapidly into some sort of... Hole? (for lack of a better word) that continued to expand as I ascended. After that I just remember coming out of it pretty disoriented and without knowledge of the experience I had just gone through. It wasnt until about a year later that I cleaned up, and started focusing on meditation and self-improvement.
All that said, I started learning how to do technical Analysis of cryptocurrency. While doing my own research (as one should always do) I saw the image of a Fibonacci Spiral and immediately the memories came back to me of the experience. Personally, and in a big part because of the experience i had, I believe the F Spiral is the basis of our universe and I believe that the universe fundamentally operates on the principals of a fractal F Spiral where the spiral is always expanding, however we all have a different starting point which creates a beginning of our own spiral at that point in the original spiral.
Where Im stuck is how that correlates to the physical world itsself... If we exist outside the physical, then it is either artificial and we were forced here, or we somehow chose to be here for some specific purpose, and I dont believe for a minute its just to experience being human.
Being a human kinda sucks. its all suffer. you need to eat? pain. need to poop? pain. sure its what we are used to so we take it for granted, but having felt the all encompassing feeling associated with not being attached to the physical world, I can tell you its a lot better than anything the earth has to offer.
In conclusion, if someone put our spirit here, then why? are we actually one spirit and by breaking us into fractal spirals we stay weak and confused? If we chose to come here, why and for what purpose? These are the answers I seek! (I know Im not the only one) </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve looked at gravity from the same perspective and gotten no where.</p>

<p>This is going into a totally different perspective than my earlier comments.. I think the practical perspective to look at gravity from is from the perspective of vacuum tubes and charged particles.   </p>

<p>Earth is a giant gas filled vacuum tube. The ground is the negative cathode and the upper atmosphere is the positively charged anode. With a non-conductive layer of gases in between. Even lightning acts exactly like a Townsend discharge like what happens in a Geiger tube. </p>

<p>So all matter is made up of atoms that are magnetically reactive as observed by how a MRI machine works. So there is constantly a &quot;rain&quot; of positively charged particles being sucked to the negative earth from space. These particles are at a high enough kinetic energy to pass the non conductive layer of gas and are so small they can pass through all matter. As they pass through matter they cumulatively pull the matter towards earth. That&#39;s the perspective that works best for me. </p>

<p>So how do we over come gravity now? If you look at how a wing works, or propulsion or any of that... We create a high pressure zone that is greater than the gravity pressure. And with wing physics we create a high pressure zone on one side and a low pressure zone on the other. We do this by physically pushing air giving it kinetic energy.</p>

<p>Which brings us to asymmetrical capacitors AKA &quot;lifters&quot;, &quot;ion wind&quot;. Using high voltage close to the range of static electricity, they accelerate ions creating a high pressure zone and a low pressure zone and lift. </p>

<p>Because lifter require voltage and surface area and not amperage I think that is the best most efficient way to go about beating gravity. </p>

And from simple geometry emerges all mathematical principles. You can write an equation to describe a shape. You can write an equation to describe forces acting against each other. You can write an equation to describe chemical interactions. You can therefore also write an equation to describe human interactions and emotions. An equation line that wouldn&#39;t be simple in its purest form, but if it was describing an interaction that resonated/harmonised well with simple geometric principles then it could be simplified via factoring, and eventually you might end up with a simple equation like &quot;need for something + unexpected gift = happiness + gratitude&quot;. I think this is also why we attribute certain feelings and emotions to things like colour. Why do we attribute red to anger? Probably because there&#39;s resonance between the two. </p>

<p>Basically particles in general exist as a wave until something collapses the waveform and it turns into a particle. Modern reporting hasn&#39;t done a great job of explaining this so they have given people the impression that human observation has some special power when in fact it does not, which is why the universe for along fine before humans became involved. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, both are organized electrically and I would venture to say that both exploit quantum entanglement to pass info between. A good analogy for quantum entanglement is, if you take a stadium and fill the circumference with people all holding broomsticks between each other, how fast does the force of a broomstick propagate? Instantly if all the links are stiff, like a broomstick. Same thing with quantum entanglement except using a planar EM wave.</p>

<p>So neurons use microtubules and actin to set up the right shapes in order to achieve quantum entanglement (mayhaps) while galaxies do so simply from the force of gravity and specific mathematical constants, with the attraction between two massive objects forming a gravity link, what would happen if you vary the gravity of one object, how fast would the other object feel it? Instantly if it&#39;s a stiff link... same thing.  But keep in mind this is the same question that gave rise to much of special relativity, how fast does gravity travel? Instantly?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s either a matter of debate, perspective, or both. Animists believe that all matter is conscious, and some &quot;scientific animists&quot; if you will (I think Nassim Haramein for one, but I might be putting words in his mouth) consider consciousness to be the foundational &quot;substance&quot; of the Universe.</p>

<p>It tracks in the sense that there is not a very clearly defined point at which matter became living matter, or where it seizes to be living matter. If you die, your remains may become flowers again, and so on, in the circle of life. I find it tough to argue that a rock is conscious, but I&#39;m not sure I can confidently claim otherwise either.</p>

<p>The fact of the matter (hah!) is that consciousness is poorly understood and there is strong evidence for it not being an emergent phenomenon, precisely. But of course we could argue this for days, as Sam Harris and Jordan Peterson and similar folks do on the YouTubes. </p>

<p>I think much of the consciousness structure as we as humans have access to it has evolved alongside our physical nature, and that in that sense what we have access to has emerged from our collective experience, our ancestral experience (the Hindu idea of genetic memory plays on this), and our individual subjective experience in life. </p>

<p>The thing that lays beyond that structure, awareness itself, can choose to condition the structures of consciousness through which we as individuals perceive the world and act within it. Conscious adaptation and reaction to the world from that space is to be living as a conscious individual.</p>

<p>And to bring it back to OP&#39;s post, I believe that this has everything to do with being in harmony with oneself as a being, where what I feel and what I think and what I see and what I say align with what I do – which has been the case maybe a handful of times in my life – is when consciousness ideally manifests towards the maximum of your physical and mental limitations.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>When it comes to consciousness I am an animist if a label is needed.</p>

<p>I have had experiences that have interpreted to show that my  consciousness is not limited to my physical body.</p>

<p>Interestingly Feynman describes playing with sensory deprivation tanks at the end of &#39;Surely you are joking Mr Feynman&#39; which he finds fascinating. As he was a very rational man who preached the correct application of the scientific method, I was disappointed by his conclusion.</p>

<p>After a few sessions, he finds that he can move the location of his consciousness to his foot. </p>

<p>Unfortunately he then decides that it is an hallucination and therefore is not interesting to further explore. </p>

<p>I would have hoped that, instead of just letting an assumption of hallucination influence him, he would have devised an experiment in which he moves his consciousness further out to try and witness a sign outside of the tank left by another person unknown to him.</p>

I recommend the book &quot;Stalking the Wild Pendulum&quot; as an intro to the concept of consciousness being the fundamental property of the universe. It&#39;s got plenty of scientific references throughout, but it was written in the 70s so some of that science is a little outdated (like its description of an electron, for example), but there&#39;s still plenty of great material and thought-provoking concepts that it covers. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That sentence makes no fucking sense.</p>

<p>Two entangled particles exist as a wave form. Upon observation, I. E. interacting with another system, the wave form collapses and it turns from a wave into a particle, which is where it remains.</p>

<p>There is, in fact, nothing probabilistic about it. It is also completely natural, not sure what you were even saying there.</p>

<p>How does the macro universe seem so consistent if it&#39;s constituent parts are essentially random you ask? Simple, basically imagine that any given particle could be the number 1 through 10. Quantum mechanics shows any given particle will completely randomly be 1-10 but it doesn&#39;t really matter because when extrapolated into the larger universe the end result is a reality that looks like 1-10.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Lol sorry, what you just said made no fucking sense.</p>

<p>The mechanism you described derives from the academic problem of simulating abstract, limited variable, finite system mathematical models, with erroneous axioms, and pretending that nature follows the same behaviour.</p>

<p>All things are varying frequencies and densities of the dielectric field interacting with itself across vast scales both linear and fractal.</p>

<p>Waves are not tangible. They are pertubations in a medium. They do not turn into particles, however particles (consider the proton as the most capacitive extension we know of on the EM spectrum) can disturb the medium.</p>

<p>I didnt read the context for this thread, I just wanted to point out that QM is physics. It is simulated probability math. It is simply an extension of particle physics, just with less accuracy and more variables, and NO PHYSICAL MECHANISMS.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Awesome. Thank you. I&#39;ll definitely peruse your links. I realized the same thing and have been searching for info for the last 2 years or so with varied results. Found spiritscience and love it!  Scientists (specifically medical) blow me off without though. Spiritualist don&#39;t usually have quite enough knowledge base. It&#39;s like the scientific process taught them to ignore the other half of the same thing. Spirit and science is one. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Your welcome, glad you like the links. Science, religion and spiritual really seems like seperate realities for some people, our Human ego, many other things and even conspiracies are responsible for these superfacial and sometimes artifical dualities and seperations.Realising We and it is All One is one of the biggest steps you can make. This step can lead you to many knowledge and can learn you to recognise and use the tools we all have in a more controlled way while creating a better world for you and All.</p>

<p>Tesla said this reality is energy and Einstein said it is an illusion, my translation for this: Thoughts are magnetic, emotions are electric and fear and Love are just the positive and negative sides of an vibrant AC-universe/ reality. All else is just a matter of perspective and perception, hence observing can become creating.</p>

<p>Have fun down these rabbitholes, but remember to look for the answers within yourself and be Honest while researching. Be the change you want to see.</p>

<p>I wonder if the ancient civilizations were working on that?</p>

<p>I can&#39;t find it right now but I&#39;ve saw a video of a guy claiming an OBE while he was taking a tour of the great pyramid. The tour guide hit a gong that was in either the King&#39;s or Queen&#39;s Chamber to show how amazing the acoustics were and he had a &quot;white out.&quot;  </p>

<p>He said he had the OBE and was instantly outside the pyramid. He was talking with Thoth and other beings he didn&#39;t know the names of until the gong stopped resonating. Then he was back inside the Chamber like nothing happened. </p>

<p>Interesting story.</p>
