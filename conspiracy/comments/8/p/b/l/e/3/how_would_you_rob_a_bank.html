<p>We are  looking for interesting ways people would rob banks to read out on the next episode of our podcast (<a href="https://soundcloud.com/user-577416408-597952088"><strong><em>the crusty crackpot podcast</em></strong></a>).  If any of you folks have any ideas we would love to hear them.</p>

<p>rules:</p>

<ol>
<li>Nobody dies</li>
<li>You gotta have a plan to get rid of the loot.</li>

<p>We are not encouraging people to rob banks, this is just an exercise in lateral thinking</p>

<p>If you read the last line of the post, we explicitly stated that this is not the case to guarantee that didn&#39;t happen, and this is not research of any kind , obviously. We read up on people who already <em>have</em> robbed banks for our research, and this is just a fun question, this kind of thing is always an interesting insight into a person&#39;s personality as there are so many ways to go about doing it.  </p>

<p>Anyway, you&#39;re perfectly free not to answer!You don&#39;t need me to tell you that, you do your thing. Anyone else reading, we&#39;d still love to hear from you, and if there are any particularly inventive ones we&#39;ll be sure to include it in the podcast with your username where you&#39;ll be made famous in front of <del>dozens</del> <strong>hundreds</strong> of listeners!   </p>

<p>But like, <em>low</em> hundreds guys, it&#39;s a small podcast... thanks! </p>

<p>No weapons needed, no one gets hurt, I stay away from the bank but close by, so i can switch the hostages for the money and make a fast getaway.</p>

<p>I&#39;d bury the cash for a few years. I&#39;ve got a decent job and a lot of patience.</p>

    <div class="md"><p><strong>Pumpkin</strong>: The way it is now, you&#39;re taking the same risk as when you rob a bank. You take more of a risk, banks are easier. You don&#39;t even need a gun in a federal bank. I mean, they&#39;re insured, why should they give a fuck? I heard of this one guy, walks into a bank with a portable phone. He gives the phone to the teller, a guy on the other end of the line says, we&#39;ve got this guy&#39;s little girl, if you don&#39;t give him all your money, we&#39;re gonna kill her.</p>

<p><strong>Yolanda</strong>: Did it work?</p>

<p><strong>Pumpkin</strong>: Fucking-A right, it worked. That&#39;s what I&#39;m saying. Knucklehead walks into a bank with a telephone! Not a pistol, not a shotgun, but a fucking phone. Cleans the place out, doesn&#39;t even lift a fucking finger.</p>

<p><strong>Yolanda</strong>: Did they hurt the little girl?</p>

<p><strong>Pumpkin</strong>: I don&#39;t know, there probably never was a little girl in the first place. The point of the story isn&#39;t the little girl, the point of the story is, they robbed a bank with a telephone.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Easier to rob a bank truck than it is to rob a bank.  There was a brilliant heist near me.  The guys watched and learned the schedule of the guys that did the truck route.  When they went into the bank to make the pick up at night, they just went up behind them and put a bike lock on the door, then stole the truck and fucked off.  Took the cash into a secondary car, left the truck in an alley.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Serious (not really) answer:  Pick a rural bank with minimal security and a slow police response time.  Cut the power, cable and phones - for extra measure, cut the power to the entire city block, or surrounding area.  Use explosives to blow open a wall and bank vault.  Just wreck that bank getting to the vault.  Grab as much money as possible and book it.  </p>

<p>Even if you get caught, you haven&#39;t harmed any innocent bystanders and if you don&#39;t get any money, you have still cost the bank a lot of money.  </p>

<p>That&#39;s actually exactly what we&#39;re covering in our upcoming episode, hopefully with an interview from Unicredit whistelblower Johnathan Sugarman. The last one was about <a href="https://soundcloud.com/user-577416408-597952088/episode-13-balliest-bank-jobs">bank heists</a> - we thought it&#39;d be good to offset the pretty infuriating subject matter of the banking crisis with some interesting bank job ideas from the online community towards the end, because the rest of it is only entertaining because of how outrageous it was. Apparently they were gambling on weather derivatives at one point.   </p>

<p>Weather derivatives. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It does actually! I know, it&#39;s totally insane. JP Morgan&#39;s derivatives portfolio was &#39;worth&#39; more than the global GDP at one point, the whole thing is a joke (and we&#39;re all from Ireland, which took an absolute swan dive in the crash thanks to our beloved bankers).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That is so fucked up, I think the enormity of it is why people never got as angry as they should have.</p>

<p>If the bank can have a derivative portfolio worth more than global GDP, they are betting with so much money that they don’t have that they can make counter-bets against any position!  It is sheer absurdity.</p>

<p>Good luck with the project!</p>

Story goes like this:  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>some coder notices that the banking software cuts off sub-penny amounts while calculating interests.<br/>
but the money has been &quot;generated&quot; by the time and balance, so it goes to waste.<br/>
one short patch later, and the tiny amounts get collected in his account.<br/>
made off with 5-6 figures... And didn&#39;t actually steal from anyone.  </p>

<p>When the time is right, we would plot an escapade so devious, so cunning, that even NASA would be impressed.</p>

<p>And then we would divvy up the money, exactly as agreed to by blood oath before the plan was put into action.</p>

<p>Well, that is what we would do, if we weren&#39;t too busy ripping bongs and blaming &#39;muh illuminatiz&#39; for all of the problems in our lives.</p>

<p>I hope this has been of assistance.</p>
