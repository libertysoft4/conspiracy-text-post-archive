    <div class="md"><p>I never doubted that a knife existed. If you guys want to go on this crusade nobody is stopping you but stop pretending this is evidence for what you think it is. Look up the definition of confirmation bias. There are thousands of other homeless camps that you can start investigating too. Better get crackin. Doesn&#39;t matter where you live.. I can slay guarentee that a homeless camp like this exists if you want to go check it out. Don&#39;t expect to be welcomed though, even if you look the part.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t watch the news and only vaguely know what&#39;s going on. Is this even on the MSM? I&#39;m just being completely honest.. that kind of shank is exactly the kind of item you would find in a homeless camp.  Why are you jumping through hoops to make whatever narrative it is that you&#39;re pushing work? When you are looking for something very specific that you want to exist you.. will find and connect any things at all cost to each your predetermined conclusion. It&#39;s the definition of confirmation bias. That&#39;s why I&#39;m asking you this question.. why do you want this to exist so badly? The evidence you&#39;re presenting actually hurts your case I just want you to know that. It&#39;s definitely a shank.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s like ghost chasers who see faces in windows or hear voices in EVPs, when you&#39;re expecting to see/hear something you most certainly will. It&#39;s the placebo effect and how some magic works - just by planting the seed that you&#39;ve &quot;cursed&quot; someone can make that person believe just enough to subtly mindfuck over time. It&#39;s weird how Native American art motifs on a casino can be turned into &quot;that creepy casino with a pedo logo!&quot; and 60 pairs of shoes turns into 100 then 600 (as seen in other threads). </p>

<p>I am FAR more inclined to think that the flamboyant transsexual who claims this site is telling the truth over these opportunistic vets who may have set out with a noble cause but descended into self-aggrandizing pseudo-heroism to stay relevant. I mean this sub SHOULD be extremely skeptical when it comes to those so indoctrinated (see the multiple instances of propagandized &quot;heroism&quot; vis a vis the vaunted SEALs and bin Laden and the whole American Sniper debacle, not to mention 4star Gen. Petraeus and his antics the list goes on.) Since WHEN are vets immune to scepticism? How did they as a group come to be unassailable IN THIS INSTANCE? There&#39;s a well being poisoned here, and some are j just so desperate they&#39;re drinking it up.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Shakes aren&#39;t just found in prisons. But I guess movies would tell you otherwise huh? I&#39;m not an expert but I have seen many homeless camps and even helped some homeless people. Over here in California it&#39;s hard to miss them because they are everywhere. You cannot imagine the environment they live in and what they have go through every day in their fight for surviva. Why do you think homeless people almost always so timid and scared. One women and her boyfriend I helped ended up in the hospital because they decided to group up with a few other homeless people for safety reasons and ended up getting beaten up and robbed while they were sleeping by those very same people they grouped up with.  The woman also had diabetes and ended up dead a few years later. Real knives have a lot of value and either get targeted by thief&#39;s or pawned so shanks that can be easily crafted and sharpened become a very real issue. Care to ask me more about this topic? I would be more than happy to answer your questions. If I can&#39;t I can always ask my wife who has her degree in criminal justice and part of her coursework involved this kind of shit. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Shakes aren&#39;t just found in prisons. But I guess movies would tell you otherwise huh? I&#39;m not an expert but I have seen many homeless camps and even helped some homeless people. Over here in California it&#39;s hard to miss them because they are everywhere. You cannot imagine the environment they live in and what they have go through every day in their fight for surviva. Why do you think homeless people almost always so timid and scared. One women and her boyfriend I helped ended up in the hospital because they decided to group up with a few other homeless people for safety reasons and ended up getting beaten up and robbed while they were sleeping by those very same people they grouped up with.  The woman also had diabetes and ended up dead a few years later. Real knives have a lot of value and either get targeted by thief&#39;s or pawned so shanks that can be easily crafted and sharpened become a very real issue. Care to ask me more about this topic? I would be more than happy to answer your questions. If I can&#39;t I can always ask my wife who has her degree in criminal justice and part of her coursework involved this kind of shit. </p>
