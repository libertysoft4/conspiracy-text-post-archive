        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Somethings not right. Anthony Bourdain was someone who was so full of life. He literally was in the middle of shooting an episode in France which anyone who reads his book would know he loved. He wouldn’t commit suicide there when he was also with his best friend Eric Ripert. Not to sound like a conspiracy theorist but he recently clashed with Weinstein.... this is too coincidental. Devastating but something is incredibly odd</p>

    <div class="md"><p>How so because we don’t even know the cause of his death yet, only that he was found unresponsive which would suggest drugs. He has a history of drug use although he had stopped taking drugs a long time ago. Also it could be accidental overdose.
Avicii also had a history or drug and alcohol abuse, something that seems to go hand and hand with his industry.
As for Kate Spade I know very little about her but her husband did say she has always been fighting her demons although her suicide was a complete shock.</p>

<p>In reality is there every anything right about suicide?</p>

<p>Harvey Weinstein is a bit of a stretch as many, many, many people have spoken out against him from A listers to small fries. </p>

<p>This could simply be lifestyle choices per individual.</p>

<p>Bourdain hated Trump.  Bourdain was outspoken about it.  See?  Anyone can do it to fit their agenda.  NATO used snipers in Maidan to frame Putin.  Why wouldn&#39;t they use &quot;suicides&quot; to get rid of Trump&#39;s enemies and frame Weinstein or Clinton or Soros?</p>

<p>Because no one suspects Trump of having a good enough reason to want to kill Bourdain. Also it seems unlikely that Trump could have coaxed all those celebrities into testifying that Weinstein was a menacing rapist.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I feel like very rich people dont need to resort to doing their Erotic asphyxiation in such a dangerous way. IMO, they could either pay someone to help them out with their proclivities, or they could purchase some sort of contraption that still provides Erotic asphyxiation, just under a much safer condition.
In my mind, I cant rule it completely out however just because the rich tend to be thrill seekers who take massive action on the things they like to get where they are now, so if they were into the danger associated with preforming Erotic asphyxiation in such a blatently dangerous way, I could see them doing it for the thrill. The thrill of being on the nedge of losing a wonderful life (from outside perspectives)</p>

<p>If those photos are real...there should be NO BLOOD when hanged, and your hands would need to be free for masterbation, AND he had a noticeable (recent-looking) scar all the way down from his neck to his groin (doesn&#39;t look like an autopsy &quot;V&quot; dissection). WTF?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not saying that any particular case mentioned here is a result of auto erotic asphyxiation, AEA deathed are a lot more common than most people realize. When I was an EMT 20 years ago we were often asked by family members of the deceased to collude with LEOs on reporting accidental AEA deaths as suicides. It was less embarrassing for the family during an already traumatic time. </p>

<p>Most of the time the family member who found the victim had already taken pains to clean up any porn, lube and tissue, toys bodily fluids, etc, but it was pretty obvious. Sometimes we&#39;d get there and the victim still had their dick in their hand. Either way, we&#39;d pow-wow with the deputy to make sure our reports were straight. Honestly, it wasn&#39;t professional or rely ethical, but this is a small community and tried to protect reputations.</p>

Chris and Chester struggled always with depression and drugs.  Not too much of a stretch to believe Carradine was into kink, but I don&#39;t know what else he might have been involved with. </p>

<p>Anthony has brought a LOT of attention to how US policies have had devastating effects on other countries.  He worked to help people.  People listened to him.  To me, this made him a target.  If he stepped too boldly on the wrong toes, a hit could have been taken out on him.</p>

Their wives are Mason (no free) stalkers basically. They listen to the Devil and get rewarded for it. The kids too. Anyone seen see the vid of Cornell&#39;s Hollywood funeral? Hisnwife is in the front row joking and laughing. They basically become cryptos once they marry in and have kids.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>dude look</p>

<p>when you get involved with this occult shit, which both of these people were, they all have the one eye stuff, numerous signs of it, they sell their souls to someone/something.</p>

<p>this is what it looks like when those people come for your soul at the time of their choosing</p>

<p>do you see?</p>

<p>you should be scared, they have this much power</p>

<p>we are civilians, they are assassins, and it&#39;s very difficult to defend yourself against an assassin as a civilian.   </p>

<p>i suspect but cannot prove that at some point one of a few things happen in these cases, 1. you know too much and are getting mouthy, but really you can probably also just know too much 2. you have something of great value that they want 3. you are a pawn in some other war</p>

<p>These are people that potentially made the occult fashions for the secret parties, and to get where they were they had to make certain obligations that made their lives a. secondary to some other organization and b. forfeit under certain conditions</p>

<p>i hope this helps</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Lol, a couple million dollars in Facebook ads and trolls is nothing compared to the US intelligence agencies influence online, or the UKs troll armies or the JIDF. BTW, if the t_d shills were so big and powerful they wouldn&#39;t be at the bottom of every thread in almost every sub. Trump&#39;s polling at 40%, you&#39;d expect there to be MORE  support for him online.</p>

<p>The totally &quot;organic and unanimous&quot; hate for him online is way more of a red flag than his support. Imo of course. Also, before it becomes a thing, not American so not a republican (or russian for that matter).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Keep in mind that of those 40%, a majority of them are 45 or older, while Reddit skews much younger. I wouldn’t expect him to have anywhere near 40% approval on Reddit, simply because the demographics don’t line up.  Reddit also has users from all over the world, and the majority of them don’t have a favorable view of Trump.  So, when you take that 40% approval, then you subtract the older supporters, and you add in the non-American users on the other side, it’s clear that a large majority of Reddit users aren’t going to support him. </p>

<p>I don’t know how much US, the UK, or anyone else spends on online trolling, but I wonder why you think it’s so much more than the Russians are spending.  As for CTR, I believe they had a budget of $1m, which is much less than this one Russian troll farm.  We also have no idea how many of these Russian troll farms their are, or which other countries are employing these same tactics.  We’ve only indicted one so far, but that doesn’t mean that’s all there are. </p>

<p>You didn&#39;t really ask any questions, you said you didn&#39;t know much about american, british and israeli efforts online, so I linked some. You did wonder why I thought the Russian efforts would be so much less than that of others.</p>

<p>That wasn&#39;t the message of my post, I don&#39;t care who does it more. I just wanted to point out there&#39;s more than 1 country spreading propaganda online.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>other than to show that the us spent $2.8m on an astroturfing campaign outside of the US,</p>
</blockquote>

<p>They didn&#39;t spent 2.8mil in total, they spent that much to get the software to  have 50 accounts per online 
operator.</p>

<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The US government signed a $2.8 million contract with the Ntrepid web-security company to develop a specialized software, allowing agents of the government to post propaganda on &quot;foreign-language websites&quot;.[2]</p>
</blockquote>

<p>and the total budget for CTR went up to $10m outside of the United States. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>No, it was 10mil in 2016 and went way down after the election, with shareblue doing most of the dirty work these days. Also, I don&#39;t think that was for influencing people outside of the US.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Russia&#39;s online meddling has been worldwide frontpage news for over a year now, so I didn&#39;t include it. Thanks for the accusation of bias though.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve seen people making huge logical leaps and I&#39;m skeptical by default but I&#39;ve definitely also seen it happen where people who are simply proposing a theory or asking questions have been pounced on by obnoxious &quot;realists&quot; even when the topic doesn&#39;t seem to warrant any such emotion.  </p>

<p>Granted, the internet is filled with people just looking for a fight because they had a bad day/week/life but sometimes there will be long sub-threads of multiple concurring parties who are adamantly in opposition of somebody entertaining the possibility of an idea that isn&#39;t the official explanation. If it&#39;s all just  people with enough free time and alt-accounts to poke their thumb in somebody else&#39;s eye, they sure like to do it here.  </p>

<p>And yet, if the occasional conspiracy theorist or Wikileaks fan were to promote some conspiracy theory that was at least partially truthful or info that was potentially damaging to any one of the millions of public and private organizations out there with ample resources to &quot;look out for their own interests&quot;, it certainly would be beneficial for them to categorically discredit the bearers of such topics as lunatics with some strategic false flag trolling and sarcastic counterpoints. </p>

<p>A good conspiracy theory can withstand questions from skeptical people.  I pride myself on trying to be skeptical in all things and to seek out more information than just whatever my echo chamber is telling me.</p>

<p>At heart conspiracy theorists, ideally, are smart people who will ponder and test a theory.  I don&#39;t drink the MSM kool-aid but I don&#39;t dismiss it out of hand.  Same with a lot of the theories here, even the ones I want to believe.</p>

<p>But then again I&#39;m the only liberal I know who goes to The_Donald a lot to try to see what the other side of the various Trump stories is, for example.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It’s selfish to expect a person to live in absolute misery and hopelessness for the sake of others. I understand he had a child so it makes it even more complicated. Depression is an awful illness for those with it and their loved ones, but imagine how much pain a person needs to be in to choose to end their own life. It’s selfish to force him to live in constant pain just to please others (pain isn’t only physical, but can be emotional too). Have some respect. Clearly your trolling so I don’t think this comment will mean anything to you, but hopefully it gives someone another perspective. </p>

<p>Well, assuming one likes vegetarian hot dogs, why <em>not</em> eat them? What do you have against engineering and food processing? Meatless products like the one you mentioned are made out of plants, and &quot;processing&quot; a plant doesn&#39;t magically transform it from good and nutritious to bad and unhealthy. Do you think chopping up broccoli makes the broccoli unhealthy? Chopping it is processing it.</p>

<p>Just curious, are you also anti-GMO?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My thought is based on many of the “vegetarians” I have known who I don’t think ever let a fresh vegetable touch their plate unless it was a condiment on a hamburger, and, oddly, most of those who ate veggie burgers/dogs took theirs with “meat” and cheese only.</p>

<p>As far as the processing, given my general cynicism towards processed foods in general, I err on the side of assuming the more processing is done to the food the more unhealthy it becomes.  This obviously would not apply to making one yourself.  Any unhealthy processed food can be made healthily at home.  How much trust do you place in a food manufacturer <em>not</em> to add chemicals, sugar, salt and preservatives to something just because it is vegetarian!?</p>

<p>I don’t really have strong opinions about GMO’s from a <em>health</em> perspective but am very anti GMO from a <em>agricultural</em> perspective.  We have already seen that GMO’s act as invasive species (something hat Monsanto no doubt was always aware of when they decided to sue farmers whose fields their crops infested, making GMO’s the perfect weapon for pushing out any competition from smaller farmers).  We will have to find out how GMO’s do in the long run against pests, because it functions as an invasive species there is <em>a significant risk</em> of these crops becoming a monoculture which is extremely unwise (read about bananas).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yup, I don’t bother with “gluten free” bread and bullshit.  Cheaper and healthier just to replace carbs with greens.  I know it isn’t (my understanding) of full keto, but I have changed my diet to primarily meat and veggies, lots of salads for fast lunches.  I feel healthier (even if partially a placebo) and don’t have that overfull, bloated feeling that bread and greasy food gives.

    <div class="md"><p>Cool.  I see too many medical advice threads that may or may not have good advice, or at least advice that helped the OP, but they post them as if they are some medical authority who has all the answers and often are outright hostile toward medical professionals.  Hopefully most people take them with a grain of salt, or at least follow the advice but continue to have a medical doctor also, that could be dangerous for people who may take it as absolute fact (which is how they present it).</p>

<p>Sure, plenty of doctors prescribe by rote and are influenced by pharma reps, this just means a person must also learn about things and be actively involved with their doctor, if that is met with a negative reaction from the doctor, they should find a different one.  Despite the problems of overprescribing, the simple things are super important that can only be done by a medical professional such as blood tests and other lab work.  More people just need to learn how to “take control” and ask for specific ones if they have reason to believe it would shed light on health issues, and expect the doctor, if they don’t want to do a test, to explain why they don’t think it is needed or relevant.</p>

<p>And so on, each thing tested should be listed and have the result.  And you can always ask for specific tests, be sure to explain <em>why</em> you want that test and such with your doctor and listen if they say that they dont think it is needed and consider what they say.  If you insist, especially on something simple like a blood test, generally they will order it even if they think it isn’t necessary (not particularly expensive and no risk to you by doing it).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I hear you - I encountered years of un-diagnosable mild neurological problems Finally discovered that the cheap poly mattress I had been sleeping on was the source due to super sensitivity to flame retardant chemicals. BTW, these are bad for almost everyone and are in most low-mid, even expensive mattresses due to CA law (Which changed finally in 2014, but so recently).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Think it depends on the brand and type of foam compound. TB117 is the CA Law from the 70s that required flame retardant treatments so most manufacturers just complied for all products. The infuriating and major hurdle is that there is no law or regulation forcing makers to reveal what the poly has been treated with. If it was manufactured in Asia you can be sure it was also treated with a healthy dose of industrial anti fungicides. In short, it&#39;s the VOC off gassing inside rooms which poses the threat. It accumulates over time (years) and does not dissipate. Never open one from the vac-seal indoors. RIP AB btw, terrible loss, will be missed.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Research social defeat.  People who are losers and mean nothing can trigger deep sense of isolation and withdrawal - physiologically - because of how we evolved.  One such response is the loss of the *ability* to perceive future happiness.</p>

<p>You really have to have faith, like you have to connect to a future logically without the emotional anticipation.  It&#39;s tough.  </p>

<p>However, a key thing is to realize *it&#39;s not you*.  Your brain is telling you you&#39;re the problem, but that&#39;s just a pre-programmed reaction due to evolution (again, triggered by assholes who don&#39;t matter).  When you realize &quot;oh shit, I&#39;m not actually the problem here&quot;, it give a little room to see the future.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Writer&#39;s block freezes many. Maybe you need to start thinking about a world where you would be supremely comfortable living in, no matter how fanciful it may seem. Better yet, work on thought experiments of how to deal with the problems you foresee; although it may not fix it should you actually get in said situation, you&#39;ll at least be going at it with some confidence and inspire someone else there with you, or it might help you see something you wouldn&#39;t have otherwise.</p>

<p>There&#39;s nothing wrong with staying in now, arguably it&#39;s always now, now is always extra time when compared to the abyss of no time (i.e. nonexistence, absence of reality), and the future is just another now which will be congruent.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I hear you, my dude. I have found - at least for me - something that helps combat this feeling of existential inertia is to be taken outside of myself --- to focus on volunteering, finding a cause that I believe in and just doing my little part to help here and there. It gives me a sense of purpose and accomplishment and a reason to plod on. Another thing that helps me - depending on how bad the depression is going - is working on a creative hobby (though I know depression can just sap all motivation), mainly because a creative hobby offers an end product you can see and say &quot;I made that!&quot; Could be anything from cooking to crocheting to coloring. Another helping means -- going outside. Breathing in the air, soaking up some vitamin D, and just being among some plant life feels good - bonus points if it&#39;s by a nice quiet stream. Finally, not sure of your living arrangements, but I really miss having a dog. I can&#39;t have one at the moment because of my arrangements, but when I did have one, a furry cuddle and play time would always comfort me, and it helped knowing that I had a friend who loved me unconditionally. If you&#39;re not a dog person, maybe a cat, or some other domesticated animal, is worth considering for companionship (unless you&#39;re just not an animal person). </p>

<p>Point is, it&#39;s okay if some days you don&#39;t have the energy to do anything but survive. You can handle this, I believe in you. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah. I&#39;m sorry but I just don&#39;t see this man killing himself. Most of the things he said like this about wanting to live came directly from him without being asked so its not like he was trying to cover up for his depression.  When people are depressed and thinking about killing themselves they usually don&#39;t say those types of things unless being asked. At least in my experience </p>

<p>excerpt: </p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;There’s no use arguing that modern society isn’t a kind of paradise. The vast majority of us don’t, personally, have to grow or kill our own food, build our own dwellings or defend ourselves from wild animals and enemies. In one day we can travel a thousand miles by pushing our foot down on a gas pedal or around the world by booking a seat on an airplane. When we are in pain we have narcotics that dull it out of existence, and when we are depressed we have pills that change the chemistry of our brains. We understand an enormous amount about the universe, from subatomic particles to our own bodies to galaxy clusters, and we use that knowledge to make life even better and easier for ourselves. The poorest people in modern society enjoy a level of physical comfort that was unimaginable a thousand years ago, and the wealthiest people literally live the way gods were imagined to have.</p>

<p>And yet.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>description</p>

<blockquote>
<p>We have a strong instinct to belong to small groups defined by clear purpose and understanding--&quot;tribes.&quot; This tribal connection has been largely lost in modern society, but regaining it may be the key to our psychological survival.</p>

<p>Decades before the American Revolution, Benjamin Franklin lamented that English settlers were constantly fleeing over to the Indians-but Indians almost never did the same. Tribal society has been exerting an almost gravitational pull on Westerners for hundreds of years, and the reason lies deep in our evolutionary past as a communal species. The most recent example of that attraction is combat veterans who come home to find themselves missing the incredibly intimate bonds of platoon life. The loss of closeness that comes at the end of deployment may explain the high rates of post-traumatic stress disorder suffered by military veterans today.</p>

<p>Combining history, psychology, and anthropology, TRIBE explores what we can learn from tribal societies about loyalty, belonging, and the eternal human quest for meaning. It explains the irony that-for many veterans as well as civilians-war feels better than peace, adversity can turn out to be a blessing, and disasters are sometimes remembered more fondly than weddings or tropical vacations. TRIBE explains why we are stronger when we come together, and how that can be achieved even in today&#39;s divided world.</p>

<p>I wondered if the &quot;Italian way of life&quot; is &quot;superior&quot; to that of other Western countries. The stronger focus on family, with people living together longer et cetera and a more &quot;relaxed&quot; approach to things.</p>

<p>There is some irony when countries like Germany ( where I am from ) belittle the more southern countries for their lifestyle and missing wealth while they appear to be on average happier. And well what is life about if not happiness?</p>

<p>But maybe it is the sun, who knows...</p>

<p>I always thought it is funny that some people have decided which &quot;measurements&quot; are good and which not. For example there is a strong focus on GDP, what does the poor person care about GDP. It is meaningless if there is a big wealth gap, yet people focus on it like it is the definitive way to judge the success of a country.</p>

<p>Things like &quot;happiness&quot; median disposable income et cetera would be far more relevant.</p>

<p>But maybe money in itself is far less relevant than we think. Like you said. Maybe sitting in a big group eating dinner for 90 minutes helps more than money in the back. But who knows. Hard to quantify such things.</p>

<p>In theory, this would lead to solving the scarcity problem and freeing up time of people to do what they want but if the last 100 years have shown us anything then that this will not happen. The 40 hour week was introduced as a step forward long ago and still, 40 hours is the norm.  </p>

<p>From a mathematical standpoint, there is no logical explanation why people should work 40 hours to solve needs that were solved by 40 hour weeks with far less efficiency. It is an illusion. </p>

<p>As dumb as it sounds Star Trek had a nice &quot;utopic&quot; vision of this but unlikely that it turns out that way. There are still people dying because they have no money. And we have a lot of stuff..... So don&#39;t expect to much from the future.</p>

<p>this is so true and i hadnt even considered it. but the obvious answer is that OF COURSE companies will milk all they reasonably can from us for as little compensation as they can provide. i think its time for the 4 day work week, and we should reevaluate in maybe 20 years.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The problem is the &quot;money&quot;. In theory, such approaches would require redistribution of &quot;wealth&quot;. But, whoever is in charge, has done a good job riling people up against this so we are likely stuck with the system. When robots will produce most of the stuff you still will see people scraping by. I assume the status quo in power distribution is considered beneficial by those who make the &quot;decisions&quot; so I don&#39;t expect this to change anytime soon.</p>

<p>Think about the utter obscenity that people die because they can&#39;t pay for shit while we churn out stuff 100 times more efficient than 100 years ago. Makes no sense whatsoever.</p>

<p>I always assumed that different socio-economic classes are good for power status quo because you can make the work against each other. Lower class thinks the middle class is the problem and vice versa.</p>

<p>But who knows maybe a &quot;problem free&quot; world will result in even more problematic for people. After all, like you said earlier on, there is some benefit to the daily struggle.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>you said you disagreed then agreed with me. im not advocating for a rat race. im advocating for doing meaningful shit. if you are pushing to meet your quota for selling pharmaceuticals you are doing it wrong.</p>

<p>if you are going to haiti to build houses you are doing it right. the problem is that society has incentivized the wrong behaviors.</p>

<p>Imagine if they paid 6 figures to build houses for your neighbors, and paid a 3 digit tax write off for poisoning your neighbors.</p>

<p>fuck, if they paid them equally guess what job listing would remain vacant and which one would be at capacity?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree with your conclusion, but not the premise.  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>human psychology isnt suited for a life where things are good and easy</p>

<p>it has been built over millions of years to survive. to strive for the things that will keep you going</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I disagree with this.  The reason for high suicide is the rat race that has taken us away from our evolutionary purpose of hanging out in small communities and freely fucking everyone without worry.  </p>

<p>Even if you&#39;re enlightened and fortunate enough to be able to step out of the rat race, you&#39;re still part of society and its norms and expectations.  You can&#39;t easily live as a free lovin&#39; vagabond, even if you can afford to buy that life for yourself.  It still comes with strings, and connections to other people who are stuck in the rat race.</p>

<p>We have created a society that doesn&#39;t allow us to be happy.  You can try to find meaning within the rat race and if you&#39;re lucky you can survive without selling your soul to the devil, but you can never escape it or its effects.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>you dont agree that its built for survival? survival depends on constantly doing the right things</p>

<p>you are rewarded for maintaining your shelter, providing your food, helping those in your tribe</p>

<p>happiness assumes you will reach a state where this is no longer neccessary and you can just relax endlessly. but if youve ever been on vacation for too long youll realize your brain stops rewarding you for this. you want to get back to something more meaningful.</p>

<p>thats what i meant. hunter gatherers are working for survival but have more leisure time than we do. they arent working for retirement. theyre working for dinner, and maybe this season</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is what I&#39;m disagreeing with.  You think the need for survival has built in us this constant need to do.  I say it&#39;s the opposite.  Survival is easy, and resulted in a preference to do little more than leisure activities.  Most people aren&#39;t experiencing ease and comfort, and even people who can afford to live a life of leisure are still stuck in the trappings that come with having the wealth to afford it.</p>

<p>Living today is not easy.  We did not evolve to think about anything more than eating fruit and fucking in a garden all day.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>our brains are wired not just from the last 1000 years of civilization, but from our years as homo erectus, habilus, some sort of chimp/bonobo hybrid, and further beyond. we were soft, easy prey for many predators. our psychology is built to keep us alive. we did this by trooping up</p>

<p>there is no doubt that humans are safer than ever before. this tale can be told by the population growth and mortality rate. we are not built for this safety. humans treat social anxiety the same as we treat survival anxiety </p>

<p>even though some people have it worse than others, nearly nobody is being preyed upon by tigers or bears, or dying from snake bites, or even dying from starvation. that is what i mean by easy</p>

<p>i am not discounting modern day difficulties, i guess i am defining &#39;easy&#39; differently.</p>

You finally go through with an expensive and troublesome surgery, you fill up with hormones, you change your name.  You&#39;re now the right gender, but it&#39;s still not enough because you can never capture the experience of growing up with your correct gender.  You can make yourself a woman, but you can&#39;t experience your first father-daughter dance, your first period, etc.  For many, they&#39;ll never be able to have what they want and when they exhaust their options and realize they still don&#39;t feel woman or man enough, they give up.</p>

There were even a few episodes that aired and he wasn’t in them bc he was either too drunk or too hungover. His substance abuse got the best of him -took the joy out of life when you’re too focused on getting your joy from liquor or drugs. I’m not surprised. Rip.</p>

And not in a casual way - I imagine how I will kill myself, I imagine exactly what it will feel like, I go through the steps in my head that would take me from this moment to being willfully dead. I wonder about what kind of hallucinations I’ll experience as my brain shuts down and if it will be a happy experience. It’s not something based on logic or “making sense.” It’s an insidious feeling that lurks in the mind of every depressive personality </p>

<p>I don&#39;t think every suicide is cover up, but I do think we need to take in consideration that celebrities live in a very different world with a very different set of rules, and not everything we&#39;re told/see may be the truth. </p>

Thelemites are a particular type of satanist (Crowleyism) and B.B. was the daughter of The Beast himself (Aleister Crowley). I assumed “they” would plot a mass murder today, but sacrificing a “star” is one of their calling cards, so I’m inclined to believe they tied up some loose ends by sacrificing him on a such sacred day as this to blue-blooded Thelemites. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Depression is a complex thing. Also,even though it looks fun on camera traveling all around the world, I&#39;m sure it becomes stressful and tiring after awhile. Never sleeping in your own bed or being away from your family. He also actively spoke about his depression and substance abuse. I remember reading somewhere that one of his favorite things was coming home and actually putting his clothes in his own washer and dryer and the peace it gave him to just sit there and watch his clothes dry. So my guess is him battling depression and trying to stay clean mixed with the high demand of his show and traveling constantly might have lead him to a breaking point. Still was very shocking and disturbing news. He will be greatly missed. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>HERE&#39;S WHAT GOING ON; People are killing themselves or &quot;dying&quot; because they are privy to a world-ending event that is coming soon, likely the Extra-terrestrial invasion that&#39;s been built up and hinted at. They don&#39;t want to face what is about to happen, because it will be worse than what we depict in movies of alien invasions. It won&#39;t be a war, it will be an outright annihilation of all life on earth. There&#39;s a reason these things are kept from us, because the truth is too terrifying to handle. These are the large Reptilians that are coming, and possible a few other hostile races.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Man I just took the most epic trip to see the solar eclipse last year and life was looking up. While the moon was about to hit C2, I had an intrusive thought, &quot;now would be a great time to do it.&quot; Fuck me.</p>

<p>The struggle is real. It eats at my psyche every day. All it would take is the wrong string of bad news and dealing with shitty people, and I don&#39;t know what I would be capable of.... Even all the therapy, pills, and good in one&#39;s life couldn&#39;t stop a determined-to-end-it-all type when the shit hits the fan.</p>

<p>But I vowed to myself, if I was literally standing at the end of the rope or looking down the barrel, I&#39;m throwing all the shit in my life away and running. Perhaps that&#39;s easier said than done when in the moment. The mere thoughts have a way of causing self destruction, leading to pain and suffering. Running would only cause guilt, pain, and suffering. Or would it? I don&#39;t know. But where would I go? What am I doing to myself?</p>

<p>It&#39;s fucking madness and mayhem in the space between my ears. But you&#39;d never know. You&#39;d see me zoned out or something and ask if I&#39;m okay, but you would never know the philosophical debate I just had with the asshole in my head. I would simply reply to you, &quot;I&#39;m okay,&quot; while internally I&#39;m saying, &quot;Why would I tell you the shit that just went down in my head? It&#39;s dumb.&quot; But it&#39;s not. It&#39;s real. It&#39;s silly when all is kind of manageable, but when you hit that wall at the dead end, you really dwell on the &#39;dead&#39; and the &#39;end&#39; and that doing it feels right.</p>

<p>When these high profile suicides occur, I can&#39;t help but think how fucked I am and that even if I get my ducks in a row, that asshole in my head will never be satisfied until I force myself to shut him up... permanently. You can run, you can hide, and you can change your life til you achieve all the greatest feats of wonder you ever imagined. But that asshole is still there. He doubts you and knows your deepest darkest secrets, regrets, and fears. He reminds you and shows you the black hole you can crawl into to escape. What lure will he use to get me to jump in? I don&#39;t know for sure, but there no harder mental chore than clinging onto the edge of that hole and pulling yourself out of it while the asshole in your head wants you to let go. And you gotta do this everyday... every. single. day.</p>

<p>I love my life and am proud of my accomplishments and have great people in it and things to look forward to. But sometimes the call of the void is tempting and sometimes I do rash and destructive things to justify the need to do it later. &quot;What the fuck, asshole,&quot; is something I think all the time. That fucker makes this thing called life a huge challenge. In the end, either he wins or I live my life with him and I win. Either way life is filled torment until it&#39;s over. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s like there is a hole in your soul and no matter what you do to fill it up, it always feels empty. I drink myself to death almost every night, then I can snap out of it for a few days, and then right back to the bottle. It fills the hole up just enough for me to enjoy the life around me, but I&#39;m drunk, peering through a window from the back of my head, not one bit happy, but content because the alcohol makes everything feel better. Then I pass out, and wake up and that hole is empty again, I&#39;m heavily hung over, I&#39;m angry at myself, and I want to fill that hole with something joyful, but nothing fits but the alcohol. I sit outside in the morning smoking a cigarette as my head pounds, my body aches, and I drink to stop it, and the hole fills up. I sit and I think about how I could possibly be happy with what I have, I have what many strive for, great kids doing wonderful in school, a beautiful wife, a house, my own business, but that doesn&#39;t fill the hole. I sit there in the morning under my crab apple tree listening to the birds, drinking my alcohol, smoking the cigarette, think how easy it could be to take the pistol off my hip and turn it to my heart and end it, just so that my wife and kids, and my mother have a face to look at when I lie dead in my coffin. When I think about that scenario it makes me not do it because it would be unfair to them because I did it to myself. But if I drink myself to death, that would just be an unfortunate side effect of addiction and would be better accepted, I would be considered troubled and an addict, not a selfish suicide. The hole will never be filled, and no matter how much money or love I have, it&#39;s always empty, and I fucking hate it.</p>

<p>While I see your point of him doing his job, I also know that CNN&#39;s job is and has always been to disseminate the propaganda coming from the alphabet agencies and the State Department. So unless he was told what to propagate at 4:26am, I find very hard to believe that he had a reason to inject the narrative that Tony took his own life.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Fair. Suicide is a conclusion from primary evidence. If the deceased was found hanging, or with bullet wounds, etc. we would typically need an autopsy or further investigation to make that claim. He could have at least put a qualifier on his assertion I agree. </p>

<p>Just to play devil&#39;s advocate, I&#39;d consider two things: (1) they worked for the same network and presumably knew each other well. The sudden discovery by Tapper might have clouded his judgment. (2) from studying journalism in an academic setting, and being a living breathing human, I have a strong distaste and distrust for the MSM business complex. Not even sinister conspiratory reasons, just a lot of people sucking at their jobs. As media business booms, and the field expands, the quality of the individuals declines on the whole. Same with our police force. Hire more police, you&#39;re gonna get more shitty police. </p>

<p>A person like JT has all the incentive in the world to break story first, ask questions later. Jump to conclusions first, clarify later. It&#39;s quite possible he was jumping to steer a narrative with corrupt motive, or equally possible IMO that he is a sloppy imprecise &quot;journalist.&quot; But I&#39;m sure that possibility won&#39;t be received well here. And again I&#39;m not denying the actual existence of an alternative set of facts, just that this tweet to me isn&#39;t compelling evidence of one. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s ok, I understand your point of view. But notice how quickly we accept the so called mainstream narrative as facts, while less than 12hrs later we are already assuming everything else as an &quot;alternative&quot; truth. That&#39;s job well done for the ones in charge.</p>

<p>As you know the mainstream media as a whole is a trillion dollar industry, and it&#39;s extremely important for the ones financing/profiteering to anchor the desired narrative early with the shock factor of the tragic event, for the highest possible impact on the population. 
We often see this with war reporting and false flag events where you are served with videos of children gasping for air accompanied with text stating that Assad, Saddam, or Gaddafi gassed his own people, etc... </p>

<p>Tapper could&#39;ve easily added a word allegedly, seemingly, or &quot;it appears&quot;, but he didn&#39;t. I&#39;m just too conscious and aware of these techniques, especially coming from CIA assets like Tapper, Cooper, etc.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve been away from this sub for a while but the Bourdain &quot;suicide&quot; just doesnt feel right and I had to see some other opinions about it. I find it very odd that a man that basically lives on vacation is so mentally depressed that he offs himself. Not to mention that his wife just made a huge rah-rah speech to rally the people against the Hollywood rapist elite. Then I read about Kate Spade&#39;s husband and his connection to Pizza Gate, and I come here and find alot of comments about depression and chemicals. Either alot of people are taking the story for face value or this sub is filled with more people trying to push the narrative as apposed to those who are actually looking for answers. </p>

<p>I&#39;m not saying that that&#39;s the case here but Anthony&#39;s girl friend accused Harvery Weinstein of rape AND.....Anthony himself accused Hilary of knowing all about Weinstein&#39;s illicit affairs.</p>

<p>Coincidence? Perhaps. Does it deserve further consideration? Absolutely!!</p>

<p>What report are you talking about? What exactly are your referencing where the Strasbourg police department has said &quot;The case is 100% closed, this is a suicide and Bourdain&#39;s crew can fuck right off back to America and take the body with you&quot;?</p>

<p>It is horribly disrespectful to randomly grab at high-profile deaths like this randomly to support your narrative. Have some dignity.</p>

<p>Hanging oneself is not the most popular &#39;go to&#39; method of suicide. Shooting (gun) followed by over dosing are at the top two means of suicide. Hanging is a horrible way to die.

<p>So your logic is that any suicide that is <em>not</em> a gunshot OR drug overdose is a covered up homicide. Right. That makes sense.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Should have seen this earlier. I just posted on here essentially wondering the same thing. He had a history with drugs, yes. That doesn’t mean he’s more likely to commit suicide. The fact that he was just beyond the middle-aged white male demographic makes him more likely to commit suicide than a drug history. There’s nothing that will ever seem right about these kinds of things, but my gut feeling says it’s a little more than that.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah man, I was saying this back in 2016 when it was everyday a celebrity was dying.  I don&#39;t buy for a <em>second</em> that Bourdain committed suicide.  I believe it&#39;s a slow (but in the grand scheme of things pretty quick) erasure of our culture in the Anglophone world, the removal of our more salient and sane voices, our cool people.  One I thought was interesting that they didn&#39;t quite get was Sinead O&#39;Connor who posted that video sobbing, saying she didn&#39;t understand why but she felt a compulsion to commit suicide.  Somehow she decided to take to social media instead of doing it.  Either &quot;they&quot; are somehow getting people to do it by fucking with their minds, or they&#39;re just being killed, or both.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This. It&#39;s not like, as many other comments have said, that this is just &quot;another celebrity suicide&quot;. There are threads and common characteristics that these most prominent people share. Many of them were particularly talented and, the most suspect quality, <em>virtue with an edge</em>. Bourdain, Prince, Heath Ledger, Robin Williams, Chris Cornell, Chester Bennington, and many others in the last 10 years. Where is the statistically equivalent horrible celebs doing the same?</p>

<p>As an artist myself, I have noticed a tendency from outsiders to &quot;frame depression&quot; on me and other artists. It feels like you have to nod your head and say yes in a ritualistic manner, similar to the endless cancer/ALS/alzheimers/other malady charitable events. Every day another disease gets its own &quot;awareness week&quot;, all the while some of the most unhealthy people are the very nurses who work in the hospitals and doctor&#39;s offices, trusting the establishment medical science, that cuts your ear to save your nose, cuts your lip to save your ear, and on and on and on.</p>

<p>In regard to cancer treatments with identifiable tumors (sorry to get off topic, but this needs to be said): a microwave beam emitter is not much different than the one you find in a microwave oven. If you turned it on and pointed it in one direction, you could pass your hand through it without too much of a problem. Change the wavelength or frequency and you can create an electromagnetic beam that will pass through nearly anything. Think x-rays, right? In common medical practice, they have to hit a sufficiently dense object to bounce back, and the receiver creates an image of the negative, and you can see bones. And we all know that the beams coming from our cell phones have no trouble passing through our bodies, building materials, etc. </p>

<p>Anyways, so get yourself a lab that has electromagnetic emitters (or build your own), where you can dial the wavelength or frequency up or down (harder to do than it sounds, but quite doable). Take two of them and tie the dials together, so when you make a change, they both get altered. Arrange them around a large 90 degree protracting curve, so that they can slide along the curve and still point at the tip of the wedge. Set a glass of water at the tip. Turn on one of the emitters and &quot;change the dial&quot; so that you create a wave that passes through the water. Perform tests to ensure. When satisfied, turn on the other wave emitter, set it to the same wavelength and frequency, and point it at the glass of water. Test different angles with both emitters pointing at the water. When you find the right angle, at the right wavelength, frequency, and amplitude, the water will heat up. You will have utilized &quot;constructive interference&quot; to create an isolated &quot;heat spot&quot;. Once you have found the right recipe, it is simple to scale the system up or down, narrow the beams or widen them. This could be used to destroy tumors with little to no damage to surrounding tissue, providing seriously useful treatment. It could also be used to seriously injure, fuck with, or kill someone, with very little, if any, damage seen from the outside.</p>

<p>Now, this is a pretty simple concept, and if you set a couple scientists working on it for a few years, if that, especially these days, you could create a working model and manufacture it without too much trouble.</p>

<p>Now, the burning question after all of this: where is this treatment? The device can certainly exist, and we have invented a thousand more complex things. All you need is a rudimentary understanding of electromagnetic waves (or possibly other wave-types: sonic, for example), the concept of constructive interference, the scientist&#39;s labor, material, and a lab for experimenting. &quot;Zapped&quot; is a good word. Keep in mind that in order for the vast majority of us to actually utilize something like this, we would have to build it ourselves.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Anti-depressants have a suicide risk  </p>

<p><a href="https://www.helpguide.org/articles/anxiety/anxiety-medication.htm">https://www.helpguide.org/articles/anxiety/anxiety-medication.htm</a></p>

<h4>Antidepressant medication and suicide risk</h4>

<p>Antidepressants can make depression worse rather than better for some  people, leading to an increased risk of suicide, hostility, and even  homicidal behavior. While this is particularly true of children and  young adults, anyone taking antidepressants should be closely watched.  Monitoring is especially important if this is the person’s first time on  depression medication or if the dose has recently been changed.</p>

<p>Signs that medication is making things worse include anxiety, panic  attacks, insomnia, hostility, restlessness, and extreme  agitation—particularly if the symptoms appear suddenly or rapidly  deteriorate. If you spot the warning signs in yourself or a loved one,  contact a doctor or therapist immediately.</p>

<p>If you are concerned that a friend or family member is contemplating suicide, see <a href="https://www.helpguide.org/articles/suicide-prevention/suicide-prevention.htm">Suicide Prevention</a>. The suicide risk is greatest during the first two months of antidepressant treatment.</p>

And if you know Bourdain from his writing and pre cnn tv, you just might think that this is just not the way he would have killed himself. It just seems too easy. It just seems too painless and void of emotion. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree that it feels odd. My first thought was &quot;what&#39;s the connection with Kate spade?&quot; Is Weinstein the connection?</p>

<p>Maybe Harvey is threatening to give up someone bigger than him in a plea deal and that person is offing people to intimidate witnesses? If Anthony was dating one of the first accusers than what better way to send a message then suiciding her boyfriend? Especially when that boyfriend is a bigger celebrity?  Was Kate close to any accusers? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have had a personal theory that he was an asset of the company. It&#39;s based on pure speculation as follows</p>

<p>The cover is at least as good as a journalist and maybe better since journalist seems to be a well known cover.</p>

<p>CNN</p>

<p>The Libya episode looks like propaganda to me.</p>

<p>Fuzzier stuff </p>

<p>In one of his shows he mentions his time in /first trip to Vietnam and it seemed he was young when he was there but I don&#39;t think he&#39;s a vet.</p>

<p>Heroine &amp; the company&#39;s role in the drug trade. </p>

<p>Around the same time that Joe Rogan started singing his praises the tone of JRE seemed to change. I think someone got Joe, I think Anthony befriended and influenced him. He&#39;s exactly the right way to approach Joe, imo. </p>

<p>I know this is all guess work but it feels like a workable pattern. Maybe he got got by someone sending a message to the company, or maybe he pissed off his bosses or was a loose end. Maybe he relapsed and thought he couldn&#39;t kick it again. Maybe it&#39;s just depression. Depression is a sneaky mother fucker, especially in people not inclined to ask for help. </p>

<p>I really liked Anthony&#39;s demeanor and work, regardless of my silly theory, I am very sad he&#39;s gone. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>On a side note, Bourdain&#39;s girlfriend account of Weinstein sexual assault beggars belief. According to <a href="https://people.com">people.com</a> she said,   “He asks me to give a massage. I was, like, ‘Look man, I am no f—–g fool,’ ” &quot; Reluctantly, Argento said that she agreed to give the producer a massage. After, she said he allegedly pulled her skirt up, and forced her legs apart before performing oral sex on her while she asked him, repeatedly, to stop. Argento said she was “terrified” of Weinstein, adding, “It wouldn’t stop. It was a nightmare.” Did Weinstein threaten her with violence? How did Weisntein force her legs apart? Why didn&#39;t she just leave? I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if Weinstein did indeed rape other women but Argento&#39;s account kind of raises a lot of questions. Now that everyone knows Weinstein was a creep everyone wants a piece of the pot. </p>

<p>I&#39;m more a fan of his outspoken nature and logic, he was a wordsmith.</p>

<p>I however, am always surprised, when they have young children.</p>

<p>My suspicion brought me here, and subsequently to his connections with Harvey Weinstein, someone who very likely has resorted to murder and has the resources to do so.</p>

<p>So many celebrities that have anything to do with (exposing / encountering ) sexual abuse ,child pedophiles etc. They all die the same way. Suicide by hanging. </p>

<p>Chester Bennington. Robin Williams , Anthony Bourdain . There&#39;s so many more. I just don&#39;t feel like digging today. The hanging suicide is always the way they go. Just remember ,the way bush sentenced sadam to death was by hanging. Wich hasn&#39;t been done ,and should&#39;ve been a shock to anyone. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Anthony Bourdain was an ignorant prick who was addicted to all types of drugs and bragged about how low he stooped. Only Netanyahu could replace such an aware-of-being-maleficent balloon of pomposity.</p>

<p>You talk about Weinstein like the only reason you&#39;re dropping his name, as well as Bourdain&#39;s, is in allegory to the line of Shem which Abraham and now Bin Salman are a part of. What a stupid post. Don&#39;t even act like Weinstein going to prison is a bad thing, or like his nepotism hasn&#39;t engulfed film like a tsunami, if a tsunami could be a rapist. Bourdain&#39;s absolute intentionality behind everything he does mocks the powerless who cannot make choices. He shows up in Brazil for example and says &quot;It looks like everyone is either fucking or on the way to fuck&quot; in the second sentence that comes out of his mouth to a Brazilian WHILE being recorded &amp; before drinking.</p>

<p>He was an intentional slob, and a pig.</p>

<p>You know who&#39;s a real man who will be missed? Gordon Ramsay. He traveled around the world and did his own series.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Wa wa wee wa.</p>

<p>The insanity is always rich in threads concerning the death of someone considered a &#39;celebrity&#39;. This thread is no different.</p>

<p>Seen in this thread is disbelief because he looked happy. He was in France. He was considered successful and rich. </p>

<p>Rumors of being offed for reasons such as population control, Weinstein links, #metoo, Israel and as a &#39;red herring&#39;.</p>

<p>Erotic asphyxiation&#39;s apparently not a possibility because he can afford to go &#39;sky diving&#39; for thrills...ffs! To the rumor that this coincides with a movie being shown on TV and it&#39;s TPTB showing their hand!</p>

<p>Truth is, the public at large have no idea who the fuck the Spade woman was. As for Bourdain, there will be a little article in worldwide papers with most people either saying, &#39;who the fuck is he? Or...&#39;oh, yeah I&#39;ve seen t.v ad&#39;s for that dude on the cooking channel&#39;. I&#39;m sorry for his families loss and any people who are fans of his work but his sort of a nobody in the grand scheme of things. </p>

<p>A few &#39;celebs&#39; deaths have been reported as suicide recently and suddenly things are &#39;odd&#39;? HARDLY! Considering the statistics from the WHO, I&#39;d consider the &#39;celebrities&#39; and &#39;rich&#39; to be WELL BELOW AVERAGE in the suicide stats.</p>

<p>Suicide is the unspoken fucking epidemic. Never fool yourself into believing you know exactly what&#39;s going on behind the scenes of someones mask. Also never forget, &#39;humans are irrational and highly illogical&#39; beings at times. Every 40 seconds, someone, somewhere, decides they want off from this world.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I believe that Bourdain was in some way involved with child trafficking and prostitution. Let&#39;s set aside, for the most part his time spent in places where that is a known practice in Southeast Asia. He has plausible deniability there at least, as an international food critic.</p>

<p>What got to me was seeing this image a couple years back:</p>

<p>from <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BjxPKxGhPhQ/">https://www.instagram.com/p/BjxPKxGhPhQ/</a> (Photo of Bourdain at Voodoo Doughnut)</p>

<p>Suspicious symbols in use at both Comet Ping Pong and Voodoo Donut:</p>

<p><a href="https://imgur.com/a/VZjtbol">https://imgur.com/a/VZjtbol</a></p>

<p>There&#39;s lots of dirt on Voodoo for those that honestly want to look.</p>

<p>Avicii made a video shining a light on child trafficking in a realistic way. Then he&#39;s dead.</p>

<p>Chris Cornell, and what looks like John Podesta&#39;s son Chester Bennington, were looking too deep. Gone. Probably occult related at least in Chester&#39;s death.</p>

<p>Kate Spade? It&#39;s unhealthy to know the Clintons.</p>

<p>I hate to say it, but this is what people say about almost any suicide.  You never see it coming.  The people who end up doing this are internalizing an immense amount of pain.  They don&#39;t wear it on the outside, and that&#39;s why they&#39;re driven to taking their own life.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Speaking from personal experience, suicide isn&#39;t always a sudden thing. Sure, there are the people that just one day suddenly decide to do it, with no explanation; but it&#39;s not typically how it happens.  People who are suffering from depression, or anxiety, and contemplating it; start thinking about it long before they try.  In fact, many times, they&#39;ll try two or three times before either getting the help they need, or actually succeeding. You never really know what may be that one thing which finally pushes someone over the edge.</p>

<p>In my case, it was a phone call with a friend. We got into an argument, and after it ended I decided I was done. Done with everything.  I ended up spending close to a month in a mental hospital for it, and I am now in treatment for the anxiety that caused it.</p>

<p>We really don&#39;t know what Bourdain was going through, or at least, what his last thoughts were.  What was the breaking point?  Was it a simple case of ‘L’appel du vide’ that got him, or something more?  We may never really know.</p>

<p>‘L’appel du vide’ translates to &quot;call of the void&quot;.  The call of the void is the thought to jump off the ledge you are standing on; wondering what would happen if you drove your car into another car or person; it is the thought of &quot;I could kill someone so easily right now&quot; when holding a knife, hammer, or what have you. In the case of someone suffering from depression, this can very easily lead to a suicide attempt, or success.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The books Weinstein were carrying right before taken into custody are the key, I think:</p>

<ul>
<li>Rodgers/Hammerstein - apparently initiators of &quot;casting couch&quot; (read: sexual exploitation)</li>
<li>Kazan - post-McCarthyism witch-hunt, labelled Arthur Miller, etc &quot;Communists&quot; (now our modern-day witch-hunt - #MeToo - instigated by literal witches, Argento included)</li>
<li>Black book - definition: &quot; a book containing a list of secret contacts, or of the names of people liable to be punished&quot;</li>
</ul>

<p>All are Jewish - Bourdain&#39;s mother was too. However, I do not think this is a Jewish conspiracy, rather a Hollywood / Establishment conspiracy, of which Jews are a part.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Bourdain isn&#39;t dead, he staged his death on June 8, which is 9 years 6 months after David Carradine&#39;s suicide.  96 in numerology means 733. Its satanic freemasonry. On May 22 Bourdain tweeted to someone that they might die of auto erotic asphyxiation in a nod to Carradine.  Then on June 3rd Bourdain posted some tweets including one of a song &quot;House of the Rising Sun&quot; and June 3rd was the anniversary of Carradine&#39;s death.  The first known recording of this song was on 9/6/33 which means 7-33-33.  So they staged his death probably because he is retiring.  His gf, his wife, his crew, all part of the hoax. All the world&#39;s a stage.  It took me a few days to pull the hoax apart. CNN, the king of hoaxes and fake news, broke the news.</p>

Chris and Chester struggled always with depression and drugs.  Not too much of a stretch to believe Carradine was into kink, but I don&#39;t know what else he might have been involved with. </p>

<p>Anthony has brought a LOT of attention to how US policies have had devastating effects on other countries.  He worked to help people.  People listened to him.  To me, this made him a target.  If he stepped too boldly on the wrong toes, a hit could have been taken out on him.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Probably why the suicide rate in the trans community is so high, in addition to the constant harassment they endure.  You finally go through with an expensive and troublesome surgery, you fill up with hormones, you change your name.  You&#39;re now the right gender, but it&#39;s still not enough because you can never capture the experience of growing up with your correct gender.  You can make yourself a woman, but you can&#39;t experience your first father-daughter dance, your first period, etc.  For many, they&#39;ll never be able to have what they want and when they exhaust their options and realize they still don&#39;t feel woman or man enough, they give up.</p>

<p>why is it personal to you?  objectively, it takes longer.   look at the recent case of murdered billionaire Barry Sherman..  police said suicide, until the family hired their own investigators proving it was murder.. guess it takes $$ to get to the objective truth these days.   </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Cool.  I see too many medical advice threads that may or may not have good advice, or at least advice that helped the OP, but they post them as if they are some medical authority who has all the answers and often are outright hostile toward medical professionals.  Hopefully most people take them with a grain of salt, or at least follow the advice but continue to have a medical doctor also, that could be dangerous for people who may take it as absolute fact (which is how they present it).</p>

<p>Sure, plenty of doctors prescribe by rote and are influenced by pharma reps, this just means a person must also learn about things and be actively involved with their doctor, if that is met with a negative reaction from the doctor, they should find a different one.  Despite the problems of overprescribing, the simple things are super important that can only be done by a medical professional such as blood tests and other lab work.  More people just need to learn how to “take control” and ask for specific ones if they have reason to believe it would shed light on health issues, and expect the doctor, if they don’t want to do a test, to explain why they don’t think it is needed or relevant.</p>
