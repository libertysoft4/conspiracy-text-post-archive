    <div class="md"><p>I know he had drug issues in his earlier years, so there&#39;s definitely a potential for over dose.
However I wonder a lot. After following many of the Weinstein accusers, I noticed they had a common theme in that they all were harassed. He was quite proactive in helping them, supporting them and with the movement against Weinstein.. There&#39;s so many factors that could come into play. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Exactly. Like, Ronan Farrow seems to be one of the few journalists willing to entertain “wacky” notions that sinister shit is going down, so at worst finds nothing...but I’m certain that won’t be true. Doesn’t hurt that early life experiences with pedo dad shaped a lifelong vendetta for actual truth.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s exactly the angle I&#39;m taking on this, personally. Was there something he knew? Did he have certain information? Was he being harassed too? A lot of people have tried to call me crazy for suggesting these things on this thread, despite the fact I&#39;ve posted it in conspiracy which I find beyond hilarious tbh, I thought this is the place to discuss such questions but hey hahaha keep down voting me guys! It&#39;s an honest lot of questions to ask, considering when you look at the information that&#39;s out there surrounding harassment from Weinstein to his accusers to the deepest of levels. I mean, hey. Anything is possible, and I&#39;m not sure why people get the shits about something they disagree with being proposed as a theory but all I can think is that there is obviously a group here that are against open thinking, which is a pity. </p>

<p>He was clearly motivated and interested in this subject, especially since his ex was raped by Weinstein. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Exactly. Some have accused me of allowing my imagination to run wild - but this is s/conspiracy after all. He had an interest and there is potential. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I mean it sucks he died but I don&#39;t see how him being connected to Weinstein would have anything to do with it. For one Weinstein is nearly broke at this point. Two he has a lot working against him with so many accusing him. Three killing Bourdain literally gives him no advantage and helps his case in no way. Weinstein is fucked with or without bourdain in the picture. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sure, Weinstein is nearly broke at this point but that means nothing. If one is to believe the victims on the topic of the harassment they endured from him, whilst building their case then anything is possible. Open mind. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The &quot;love&quot; of his life Asia Argento was caught in photos with another much younger guy flouncing around Rome. He made a big deal about how brave she was with Weinstein &amp; found out she is a tramp. He probably really loved her &amp; felt like a dope besides being depressed.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Speculation, again - but potential. No one has confirmed she was cheating. No one reliable source has proven it. It&#39;s the daily fucking mail, but everyone&#39;s willing to believe it? Come on </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Undoubtedly, but he was also open with his battle to stay clean - he kept busy with various hobbies including putting together his own comics and perusing jijujitsu. I just find it hard to believe. And there&#39;s always a possibility that there&#39;s more to the story, of course we won&#39;t know that for some time to come, but I do hope in due course we find that this is the case and nothing more sinister. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I initially thought he was murdered too, until I saw how &quot;close&quot; Asia and Hugo clement are lately. Holding hands, embracing, her touching is lower stomach as they walked... Fucking weird. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Agreed. I still wonder if there&#39;s more or even less to it, I mean the only source available seemingly on the subject is from DM - which as many of us know aren&#39;t exactly the best at what they do, and love a bit of sensationalism, BUT. In saying that there has been enough evidence photograph wise to show there may be a lot we don&#39;t know. We may never know, sadly. And if it is the case she cheated on him I will of lost all respect for her and many other of her friends. </p>
