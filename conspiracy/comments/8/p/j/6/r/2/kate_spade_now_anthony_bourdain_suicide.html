    <div class="md"><p>Gut reaction based on what? The guy was an ex drug addict that has dealt with depression in the past and is a somewhat heavy drinker. There would be no reason at all to murder him, he&#39;s a celebrity chef that made a couple comments about a dude that is fucking despised by everyone. There is literally nothing at all &quot;fishy&quot; about it. It wouldn&#39;t make any sense whatsoever to chance murdering a guy whose platform is a travel show and twitter. Why not murder people making allegations? And who is doing this murdering? Think Weinstein, a pariah if there ever was one, decided to have him killed and not any of the dozens of women who can make allegations against him? If <em>this</em> is fishy to you then I&#39;d imagine anytime anyone commits suicide it&#39;s fishy to you. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Nowhere does it say that gut reactions are based on nothing at all.  Where did you get it isn&#39;t based on anything? You&#39;re reacting to a guys suicide based on what? You just jump to that? Because if you just jump to that then thanks for proving my other comment where I said I bet you <em>always</em> jump to that. As soon as you heard about Anthony you thought something whether you think you did or not, in this case suicide. It&#39;s cool, it&#39;s very common around here. Also, way to sidestep the entire rest of what I wrote. Bravo</p>

    <div class="md"><p>just be careful my dude</p>

<p>i personally wouldn&#39;t touch it unless you are already an addict... </p>

<p>i myself have never done drugs except coffee and alcohol and i hate alcohol</p>

<p>I was just speaking about what I observed which is that addicts who force themselves to be sober are much less likely to survive than the ones who learn how to manage their addictions.. It&#39;s like 5 percent who can stay sober and like 90 percent literally who can learn med management. I probably witnessed several hundred addicts over the course of about 10 years. </p>

<p>Props to the ones that can stay sober but I feel like AA and NA kind of rely on this placebo effect which relies on telling people there is no other way to survive besides being totally sober which is a lie and leads many people to feel like hell everyday and sometimes sucide or at least many times self destructive relapse. </p>

<p>You could technically even learn to use heroin in a controlled manner.</p>

<p>And Fentnyl, as demonized as it is, has actually a higher therapeutic ratio than morphine and is better at causing coma without death so it&#39;s used in surgery. Problem is just accurate dosing but the ratio of the dose that kills to the dose that just gets effects is like 3-5 times that of morphine so with proper measurement it&#39;s safer. </p>

<p>There is just all these false drug dogmas.. sad cause it leads people to living hell and/or death. Best of luck. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh, I know it acts on opioid receptors, we ain&#39;t tryina fly all day and night. But as an alternative to drinking heavily or smoking too much we wanna try it out. Kava is a little more controllable and take a lot to be potent (and a bit more expensive since it&#39;s so popular and takes years to grow). </p>

<p>Did you work in a clinic or medical setting? Or just personal experience? I agree with a lot of what you are saying and I think the lesser of two &#39;evils&#39; is a good gateway to a more sober life. Going full on cold sober works for a small amount of people, but that willpower is hard to achieve or physically extremely difficult to pull off depending on the level of addiction. </p>

<p>The kava bar offered it &#39;off menu&#39; so I assumed it wasn&#39;t totally chill, but my friend(he&#39;s grown mushrooms and made DMT at our house) was very curious. I felt good on it but not trying to make it a habit. I appreciate you looking out for folks in any case </p>

<p>He probably wouldn&#39;t have done it if he was able to manage his brain chemistry with the proper maintenance meds.. like kratom which even has some antidepressant (serotonin) effects.</p>

<p>I volunteered with addicts and they would also &quot;relapse&quot; in the most destructive way possible right after they had been forcing themselves to be sober.. it&#39;s like a pressure cooker... people who are addicts LOVE drugs and have messed up brains and it&#39;s dumb that medical culture has this cookie cutter dogmatic approach which says they all need to be sober.... I&#39;ve witnessed many suicides at the place i volunteered exactly because of this! </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Doesn&#39;t mean that he wasn&#39;t anxious, and craving opiates 24/7.. I have experience working with addicts for 10 plus years and some of the patients I met towards the beginning are still sober and still living a hellish SOBER existence full of craving and anxiety that mimics schizophrenia!! I know it&#39;s not purely schizo either because in the cases where the person started taking opiates again the symptoms disapeared. Even the mainstream corporate research says that it takes over 7 years for the brain to &quot;heal&quot; but you know that means it might not even happen at all!! </p>

<p>This is his quote:</p>

<p>&quot;It is one of the central ironies of my career that as soon as I got off heroin, things started getting really bad. High on dope, I was — prior to Gino&#39;s — at least, a chef, well paid, much liked by crew and floor and owners alike. Stabilized on methadone, I became nearly unemployable by polite society,&quot; <em>Bourdain wrote in Kitchen Confidential.</em></p>

Edit: did a wiki, and apparently he divorced in 2016 and had been dating Asia Argento. Since 2017 he had been a vocal advocate against sexual abuse in Hollywood since Argento&#39;s allegations of sexual abuse against Harvey Weinstein. Raise any flags yet?</p>

<p>So you know so little about this guys life you didn&#39;t know he was divorced, but you know enough about his happiness/mental state that you know he wouldn&#39;t commit suicide. Got it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No they aren&#39;t. State-sponsored Stasi operations will kill innocents. I know they told you that only the guilty would kill themselves, but it&#39;s not true. Overt surveillance is designed to be able to kill anyone, guilty or innocent. Overt surveillance is conducted because it costs multiple millions of dollars to perpetrate. It&#39;s a profit model for the deep state. And you are one of the stooges we cheered to see Indiana Jones pummel when we were children.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So you had no clue he was divorced, still pretty recent. That&#39;s stressful right? You at least know he had some hard drug issues in his past, right? Seems believable a guy getting over a divorce with a lifelong struggle with hard drugs could take his life, no?</p>

<p>You do know his show was shut down in the past mid-filming because he was too drunk and/or pilled out. He&#39;s still known as a big drinker... one of the biggest depressants there is.</p>

<p>His current girlfriend not only was involved with Weinstein but actually was his legitimate girlfriend at some point after she was allegedly harassed by him. </p>

<p>So right there are a whole bunch of pretty recent things that can cause mental distress to someone. And we don&#39;t know what his internal make-up and propensity for mental issues like depression was before all this stuff that has happened over past few years.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t understand why it&#39;s unbelievable. </p>

<p>In fact, the only people I&#39;ve seen say this so far seem to have no clue regarding facts about him and come off as extra childish and paranoid. </p>

<p>Apparently, It&#39;s not believable that a heavy drinking former hard drug addict TV personality chef killed himself but more likely he was literally just about to expose TPTB or Harvey(the girl he&#39;s been dating for like a year is the one with the info, not him) or pizzagate and was killed for it.</p>

<p>Remember that these good people don&#39;t die if we carry on getting their message out there. He advocated for a range of good causes, speak out against sexual harassment, support real food, not processed rubbish and share your passions with the world. We need more passionate and caring people like Anthony Bourdain, best way to make that happen is to be one yourself.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Gut reaction based on what? The guy was an ex drug addict that has dealt with depression in the past and is a somewhat heavy drinker. There would be no reason at all to murder him, he&#39;s a celebrity chef that made a couple comments about a dude that is fucking despised by everyone. There is literally nothing at all &quot;fishy&quot; about it. It wouldn&#39;t make any sense whatsoever to chance murdering a guy whose platform is a travel show and twitter. Why not murder people making allegations? And who is doing this murdering? Think Weinstein, a pariah if there ever was one, decided to have him killed and not any of the dozens of women who can make allegations against him? If <em>this</em> is fishy to you then I&#39;d imagine anytime anyone commits suicide it&#39;s fishy to you. </p>
