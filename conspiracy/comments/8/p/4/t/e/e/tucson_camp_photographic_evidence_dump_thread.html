<p>We all know child trafficking is a Huge problem and I wouldn&#39;t be suprised if it is a child trafficking camp but most the videos are of the one dude saying THE KIDS ARE GETTING RAPED</p>

<p>We all need to see physical evidence and decide for ourselves. Here is what I&#39;ve found so far. </p>

<p>This pictures the &quot;rape trees&quot; and parts of the camp.

<p>This clip actually pictures the inside of the bunker they keep talking about </p>

<p>Finally found a child seat they keep taking about

<p>I don&#39;t have FB so .maybe I&#39;m missing out on some of the evidence, but where are the 60+ pairs of shoes? Where are the blueprints for sex dungeons?? That&#39;s what I want to see. </p>

<p>I&#39;d like to see a well sourced post detailing all the circumstantial evidence available with photographs / documents, including contributions from those digging for more information and following the money.</p>

<p>A more thorough compilation is needed, with greater collaboration and minds at work. I like your idea of a dump thread, but the way Reddit works, you will see posts such as these instantly criticized (rightly or wrongly) for lack of information and in general talking about the lack of detailed information and laughing at the &quot;nonsense circumstanial evidence&quot;, rather than aiding in the research and compiling of the information out there.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think these guys need to start their own investigation and should begin by interviewing local homeless (not just homeless veterans, by the way, but them included). You never know what information might turn up. Next I think they should consider interviewing local prostitutes - as messed up as that may sound. Some of them may have narrowly escaped trafficking situations, you don&#39;t know. Granted some of them won&#39;t say anything and some just won&#39;t know anything but again, it&#39;s a place to start, and the word of these people is often taken for granted, but they could have valuable information about trafficking rings or some shady people which could lead to another piece of info. Hell, even if it doesn&#39;t tie to Cemex, maybe it will lead to some other trafficking thing. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is one of about a dozen videos on the subject put out by them or with them in it. I&#39;m just filling you in on the fact that no homeless were involved in the discovery of or promotion of the camp. There&#39;s two different entities involved. One is VOP, Veterans on Patrol, who found the camp when out looking for homeless vets to assist, which is a normal thing for them. They then contacted Craig Sawyer, who is a legitimate child trafficking expert, who came and saw it and agrees that it looks suspicious. People are questioning the VOP figurehead when you see all of the talk going around about being a felon, his involvement in the Bundy incident, etc... Craig Sawyer is on the up and up as far as anyone can tell. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>He might vaguely resemble Dan Bilzerian but their character could not be further apart. I have been loosely familiar with Sawyer for a while. It makes sense that he would be someone called to offer his expertise, being he runs Vets 4 Child Rescue, and that&#39;s pretty much the extent of his involvement. He&#39;s been pretty much the exact opposite of the VOP crew throughout this. He&#39;s been professional, not seeking attention, and level headed. </p>
