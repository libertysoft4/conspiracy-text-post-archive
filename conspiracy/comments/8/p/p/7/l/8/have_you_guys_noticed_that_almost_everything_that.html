<p>seriously, ive said far worse things than that that i have not done and would never do. and ive heard far, far worse from women talking about men.  </p>

<p>and how about this. from a mainstream magazine. posting an article about mens dicks.  men who train for their whole life to compete in the olympics and cosmo writes an article about oogling their dicks.  where was the outcry?  but trump makes a stupid comment about grabbing chicks by the crotch (which again, no proof ever actually even happened) and all the sudden he is the worst person ever?  come on.

    <div class="md"><p>have you never hung around a group of drunk women?  talking about the things they would do to some hot guy across the bar or something?</p>

<p>i spent a good chunk of my teen years on a competitive dance team that was like 5 of us guys and 200 girls.  they are just as filthy minded as guys, often worse, and you know what, who cares?  a group of friends sitting around saying awful stuff that never happens is not that big of an issue.   and thats what the grab the puss thing was.  it was 2 guys who thought they were having a private conversation talking about dumb shit that damn near every guy talks about at some point.  </p>

<p>or are you going to tell me youve never been with friends and said something along the lines of &quot;oh, id fuck her so hard her mom will feel it!&quot;.  or him or whatever youre into.  because how is that any more appropriate?  its just as rapey is it not?  </p>

<p>so how about we just stop with this self righteous indignation bullshit and focus the hate on people like bill cosby who was actually out drugging and raping women?  or all the scumbags in hollywood taking advantage of everybody.  crazy idea i know, but maybe instead of getting all up in arms about something that has zero evidence of actually happening and was just a stupid supposed to be private conversation between 2 people go.  because who fucking cares what 2 dudes said to each other on a bus 10 years ago or whatever. it has zero impact on fucking anything.  everybody has made some stupid remark that could be taken badly by somebody.  but most people dont have to worry about cameras and mics being everywhere.   </p>

<p>at least im not too big of a hypocritical asshat to admit ive said dumb and awful shit before.  because apparently nobody else has.  they are all living comfy lives in their glass homes with no rocks to throw. not a single one.  all a bunch of ned flanders or some shit.</p>

<p>thats a pretty big part of it, no?  of course nobody should be going around just grabbing people.  but is simply talking about it really that big of a deal?  </p>

<p>or are we going to pretend he is the first person to become president to have said or done something like that? cough cough bill clinton.... he was caught with his cigar in an intern.  presidents are people too, for better or worse.  i dont think being so outraged over somebody just saying something stupid with no evidence of it happening is worth the time.</p>

<p>just like i dont care what bill is doing now i dont care what trump did before, that is between him and his wife. bill is free to have freakin orgies at his house if he wants.  film it. sell it. i dont care, what he does in his private life is his business and banging interns is not in itself illegal. but when you move that orgy to the white house, when youre in office, we have a problem now. thats not just his personal life. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>I&#39;ll be honest I didn&#39;t actually look up who he was mocking</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Case in point, the media can spin anything they want any way they want it.  The truth about the handicapped guy getting mocked is as follows.  They notice that Trump makes this gesture (the retarded hands thing) whenever he is mocking his critics or people who say dumb things so the find a person with said condition to criticize him publicly and they sit back and wait for Trump to bite.</p>

<p>They do this kind of shit all the time to public figures they want to character assassinate.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I have no problem with the women involved in the situation. I have a problem with someone in charge of a country talking like he can just do whatever he wants to women with or without their consent.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>All I had to do was summon fake outrage about women&#39;s choice and you&#39;re back on your heels signaling how virtuous you are.  This is called identity politics and gives no consideration to the individuals (good diggers, groupies, alimony chasers) who make a choice to do exactly what Trump described.  Everyone knows they exist, and they exist on all levels.  The only thing wrong that Trump did was get caught on tape talking shit to other guys who were goading him on about it.  We&#39;ve all bragged about stupid shit and sometimes it&#39;s about loose women or sexual conquests.  Sex is absolutely not a taboo topic, shouldn&#39;t be and it&#39;s ridiculous.  </p>

<p>Alot of the people complaining about Trump grabbing the pussy of girls who literally want him to do it are the same people who can&#39;t see a problem with a transexual person keep their status a secret and &quot;conquering&quot; heterosexual partners.</p>

<p>The layers upon layers of hypocritical outrage on everything Trump related is getting old as fuck.  It&#39;s obviously being force fed into the narrative.  </p>

<p>My favorite example is the George Zimmerman Ultra experiment.</p>

<p><strong>Yes, this.</strong> This is <em>exactly</em> the kind of bullshit that made me wake up and see how problematic feminism is (not trying to derail topic, so people, please do not reply to me regarding feminism - I&#39;m sticking to Trump discussion; however I would love someone to do a post on 3rd wave feminism as psy-ops). When I was involved in that cult-like mentality, it was so easy for me to believe politicians who pander to &quot;women&#39;s rights&quot;, and it was so cheering to me to think there were politicians out there who really did GAF about women (I am a woman, btw); as a result, I didn&#39;t bother looking into the hypocrisy of all the candidates and only focused on how &quot;terrible&quot; Trump was for his language use. It wasn&#39;t until after the election that I had a miraculous epiphany that Trump is no worse than anybody else in office proclaiming a &quot;virtuous&quot; ideology. (Again, not yet sure where I stand on him now. I don&#39;t hate him, and I disagree with a lot of his policies primarily related to wildlife, but I do agree with other policies, and I refuse to hate him more than any other politician when they have pretty much all been nothing but greasy liars.) </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I love how I get downvoted just because I admit to being neutral about Trump. Liberals claim to be the &quot;open-minded&quot; group but they are so self-righteous that they willfully disregard their own hypocrisy. I know this because I <em>was</em> one - I was the flag-waving feminist voting blue no matter who. It took the election of 2016 to make me see that people were disproportionately hating the man. Yes, he is obnoxious and vulgar and &quot;not presidential,&quot; but I have yet to encounter <em>anyone</em> who either can or is willing to articulate to me exactly why Trump deserves more vitriol than any other person in significant power. I don&#39;t care that they hate him, but I care that it&#39;s not equal hatred of politicians all-around. I <em>always</em> get the same &quot;Well so-and-so is the lesser of two evils&quot; (ie Hillary&#39;s campaign) - but are they <em>really</em>??? If you want to hate Trump, that&#39;s your business, but at least be honest enough to admit that the reasons you&#39;re hating him are paltry compared to the wide array of reasons available to hate other people in power, including the people you stoop to vote in because you&#39;re too lazy to do the research on the candidates beyond checking compromised and extremely biased &quot;news&quot; sources like NYTimes or the like. Eugh. </p>

<p>or is the left now going to apply that logic of lumping everybody into the same group and admit that all muslims must be terrorist because some terrorist stand next to other muslims?  and all blm supporters are cop killers because cop killers showed up to their marches.  </p>

<p>so which is it, do we lump everybody into one group or do we not?  you cant just pick and choose on a whim. that would be awfully hypocritical, wouldnt it?  or did you go to those marches and chat up every single person there to see what they were there for?  im sure you did that, you seem like you have some solid logic here.  though since im a nazi why listen to me?  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This all happened back when I was a teenager, but Trump was pretty well known for being a racist.  This Central Park Five thing came several years after Trump was sued for not letting black people rent his properties.</p>

<p>Again, after those guys were proven not guilty by DNA evidence, Trump still (even as recently as 2016) claims that they are guilty.</p>

<p>Either Trump is too stupid to understand what DNA is, he&#39;s unwilling to ever admit he&#39;s been wrong, or he&#39;s a racist.  Or possibly some combination of those three.</p>

<p>Anyway, the guy&#39;s got a pretty established pattern of talking shit about minorities.  He rareley does this stuff with white people. 
 Although I do remember he dated a pretty hot black chick for a while.</p>

<p>please show me in that article where he said they were guilty because of their skin color.</p>

<p>he said they were guilty because: &quot;They admitted they were guilty&quot; and &quot;The police doing the original investigation say they were guilty. The fact that that case was settled with so much evidence against them is outrageous&quot;.  maybe im the idiot here, but which of those statements involves race in any way at all?  ill be waiting on the edge of my seat for your answer on that one for sure.  because you dipshits always have an answer to why YOU think something is racist.  </p>

<p>so if he did speak to the case in regards to race you sure picked the absolute fucking worst article to prove your &quot;point&quot;.  at least find something remotely relevant to your argument if you are going to try and tell me why i am so wrong.  </p>

<p>or since this is reddit, enjoy your upvote glory because fuck trump LOLOLOL!!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not a coincidence. There has been a concerted effort to ensure left leaning posts make it to the front page. I really hate to get too political here, but I honestly think the &quot;bad&quot; democrats have teamed up with Chinese communists to ensure certain ideologies are heavily promoted on this website. Forget the name of the known Chinese group that is paid to post pro Chinese commentary online. </p>

<p>Many on the extreme left understand that communism and socialism will never be possible in America unless they destroy America first.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The narrarive is that trump is the worst thing in the universe. His presidency is suppose to teach america and its people to participate in democracy and not assume someone else will do it. Cant trust media or politicians as corruption runs wild. To solve this, real change is wanted and needed, but if a considerable population size still wants to revolt. A 50/50 split on shithole choices last round brought to you by elextoral college, means there is considerable discourse in the public. Everyone wants change, but promises are never met for the people, corporate donos sure. Everyone erged people to come out and vote, like that matters. The lesson was not only to vote, but participate in politics, actively participate. Not just consume lying media and swallow it up as truth. Lessons are being taught the hard way, through self education. If the public cannot overcome the programming they will continue to be punished(its simple law of the reality)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You think the MSM is not covering the meeting between Trump and Kim Jun Un? It’s more likely that the NK meeting was purposely scheduled to conflict with the G7 meeting in Canada (which Trump will be leaving early in order to “prepare” for his meeting in Singapore with NK). If anything, Trump “smartly” is trying to take negative press away from the G7 meeting and pushing the coverage over to his NK summit (where all he needs to do in order to get good press is agree to more meetings and a “commitment” to end the war in Korea). </p>

<p>The MSM has absolutely been covering the NK summit. You could argue that the MSM is poisoning the well, by focusing on Rudi Giuliani’s insane comments in Israel. But you can’t say that the MSM is hiding or minimizing the meeting.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ll never vote for DJT and have some serious policy disagreements with where he&#39;s leading us.  However, just out of a basic sense of fairness, I find myself defending the guy.  The 24/7 anti-Trump hysteria has made alot of people on the left just flat-out stupid about the bigger picture.</p>

<p>Environmentalists, or anyone on the left, really, complaining about tariffs on Chinese solar panels is a good example.  The reason those panels were cheap to begin with is China&#39;s craptacular wage, safety &amp; enviro regs along with not accounting for the true cost of hydrocarbons in shipping.  The demand for solar panels isn&#39;t going away, but now there&#39;s some space for US companies to get in.  Anyone who is pro-union should realize these tariffs are flocking up NAFTA and 20+ years of <strong><em>multi-national/corporate/state</em></strong> trade practices that haven&#39;t done blue collar manufacturing workers any favors.  Much of the regs for TPP are already on the books thru separate trade agreements.  DJT is flocking all that up.  Kicking the TPP sandcastle over isn&#39;t something anyone on the <strong>ACTUAL</strong> left should be complaining about.  All those protesters who trashed downtown Seattle b/c WTO should be giving DJT a thumb&#39;s up on at least one aspect of trade policy.</p>

<p>This isn&#39;t to say tariffs are good things, but the MSM isn&#39;t remotely giving balanced reporting on the pro&#39;s and cons.</p>
