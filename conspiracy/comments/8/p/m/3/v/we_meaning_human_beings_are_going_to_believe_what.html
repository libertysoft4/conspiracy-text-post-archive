    <div class="md"><p>I have lived my life this way since 1993 when I studied the Income Tax code and learned it was all a scam.  I tried to spread the word after getting 2 IRS agents to put me on hold FOREVER due to the fact they could not answer my simple and calm questions about the law.</p>

<p>I finally realized that most people are idiots and deserve to be suckered if they do not seek the truth out for themselves.</p>

<p>15 years later, saving at least 5 - 10k per year not paying the Federal Mafia tax, living in the SAME house and never hearing from my state or the IRS since has absolutely convinced me I chose the right path.</p>

<p>To all those that since then have thrown away between $45,000.00 and $200,000.00 to be sent directly, as interest on the Federal Debt - basically to put ACTUAL money into the pockets of the elite banking families instead of the fraudulent fiat currency that they issue, so they can buy more cars and mansions and control more people, I pity and am angered by you for you pathetic, brainless, selfish act (of paying income taxes).  </p>

<p>You are only perpetuating the SERIOUS drain that these leeches have on our productive society because of your fear and ignorance.</p>

<p>ANYWAY - let them suffer while those of us that THINK for ourselves begin to break free from tyranny and start to serve as examples to those that are too afraid to act against &quot;the Matrix&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Are there risks when standing up to a corrupt government that operates outside of it&#39;s own laws?  YES.  But you are at risk of an audit and being thrown in jail even when you follow their illegal commands and pay a tax you can&#39;t possibly be liable for.  Every time you sign a 1040 you a swearing under penalty of perjury that everything on the form is true, but the fact is that you are (maybe unknowingly) lying because you cannot possibly owe that tax.  Also, as eccacles says above, signing that contract then allows them WAY more power over you for that year. Now you have sworn that you in fact DO owe the tax and they can change how much, say you are lying and audit you, garnish your check without a court order(illegally of course).  The point is you take a risk paying, you take a risk not paying.  There is no way around it when the government is as out of hand as they currently are.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s all about commercial contracts - most people unknowingly contract themselves into paying income tax (for a supposed benefit), be it through their signature on a checking account or SSN(SIN)#.  Contracts are what run the world, and private contracts will always supersede general laws, such as the constitution.  A good example of this would be if you worked and signed a non-disclosure agreement to not speak of company details.  If you did and got caught, plead your right to free speech the private contract would overrule.</p>

<p>The journey involves understanding these contracts and getting yourself out of them.  I would like to know more details regarding your battle - what questions you asked, whether or not you fought in court, did you take control of your &#39;strawman&#39;, etc.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>I pity and am angered by pathetic people like you who think that just because there is a loophole, that you aren&#39;t supposed to pay taxes and contribute. You are a freeloader, plain and simple. </p>

<p>Are you really going to be this smug about what your taxes go towards when your house is on fire and you need the fire department? Are you going to be this arrogant when you need the help of the police someday? Do you not walk on sidewalks or drive on roads because of your feelings? Do you avoid drinking water, or having any kind of modern comfort in your home? Do you have kids in public schools? Did you yourself go to public schools? I could go on, and keep listing your hypocrisy, but you hopefully get the idea by now.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, contributing citizens, who aren&#39;t on some self serving arrogant mission, are paying for all of these things you obviously take for granted. I don&#39;t like a lot of programs my taxes go to, but a lot of them I consider highly beneficial. If you think <em>every</em> tax dollar is going into some bankers pocket you are delusional and uninformed.</p>

<p>In case you haven&#39;t been outside in the last 50 years, we have arguably the highest quality of life in this country, than any other citizens on the planet. Part of that, is because we have a strong workforce, of the employed, and taxable. This country was not built on hopes, dreams, and tax evasion, it was built with money taken from contributing members of this society.</p>

<p>I happily pay taxes, even knowing there is people like you out there sitting in their arm chairs ranting about how cool it is to not pay taxes. Part of what makes me American is that I am willing to support the country I live in, and in your case, some militant jerk who wants all of the benefits, but refuses to contribute.</p>

<p>EDIT: </p>

<blockquote>
<p>You are only perpetuating the SERIOUS drain that these leeches have on our productive society because of your fear and ignorance.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So the people paying taxes which fund the services you use are the leeches? Meanwhile the guy who refuses to pay his taxes, can sit around and free load and bitch all day about a country he isn&#39;t even contributing too?</p>

<p>Hypocrite. </p>

<p>Taxes were originally meant for profits, not wages. That isn&#39;t excusing taxes or legitimizing them, but gives you some perspective on how twisted the tax system has become and will continue.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Like I said in my post, I don&#39;t agree with everything my taxes go to, and never said or think the system is perfect. What I do think, is that it works better than a lot of other nations. My original point still stands, that even though it is not perfect, it is certainly working well. No one in this country can say they have it bad, that there is no opportunity, or that the government isn&#39;t providing the services and comfort they require. It could be much worse.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Corporations only pay taxes on their profits. Fair, right?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I do think that is fair. Considering how marginalized our corporations are becoming in the global market, we can&#39;t tax them in that fashion. The reason we don&#39;t, is so they stay competitive, and keep employing the citizens of this country. It&#39;s one of the few things keeping corporations on this soil, and not sending them over seas. As a direct result of this, the more people these companies employ, the more tax revenue the Govt can generate. It&#39;s in everyone&#39;s best interest.</p>

<p>Personally I don&#39;t get why people fly off the handle about taxes. When I look at my salary, I don&#39;t get mad because I&#39;m not &quot;getting&quot; all of it, I do the math and figure out what my take home is, and that is what matters. Just be realistic about the system, and it&#39;s not that bad. Also, you can always move to another country that has a better system (which even I have thought about doing as well).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s people like you that THINK they know what&#39;s going on that are the problem.  It&#39;s not a loophole dildo IT&#39;S THE LAW.  I studied it for over 10 years HAVE YOU?</p>

<p>The services you speak of ARE NOT FUNDED by income taxes.  The are funded by loans from international banking families, these are loans OF NO VALUE, until dummies like you make them legit by paying income taxes.  Sorry to tell you but everything you pay goes RIGHT INTO THE POCKETS OF TRILLIONAIRES as INTEREST never actually paying for ANY SERVICES WHATSOEVER.</p>

<p>Study the laws of the Internal Revenue code, the Constitution and all of the pertaining court cases for at least a year, learn the truth about the Federal Reserve and how it is funded and WHO &quot;funds&quot; it -  then come back here and state your case.  </p>

<p>And ANYONE who argues that this country is so wonderful and then say :&quot;you can always move to another country that has a better system&quot; to people who question the illegal actions of it&#39;s government...doesn&#39;t actually believe in the system the country is founded on at all.  We have the right to not follow the illegal actions of the government and all of it&#39;s agents.  AND YES THE I.R.S. acts in an illegal manner with MOST of what it does.</p>

<p>I suggest you start here: <a href="http://paynoincometax.com/pdf/federal_mafia.pdf">http://paynoincometax.com/pdf/federal_mafia.pdf</a></p>

<p>If you actually read this book, you will start to understand how your precious government acts with complete disregard to it&#39;s own laws and common decency every day.  And maybe you will understand that the more people that stop supporting it and it&#39;s illegal and immoral actions by not paying &quot;taxes&quot; they can&#39;t possibly owe under the law, then the faster we as a country can start to unravel to huge mess and start living under the rule of law and the true principles of freedom enumerated by the Constitution and the declaration of Independence.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>OK, so I started reading that document (about the first 40 pages or so), and intend on reading the rest. This brought up a couple questions I have for you.</p>

<p>Seeing as how Schiff has had a long trying battle to get out of paying taxes, considering he is still within the law, I&#39;m curious what kind of hurdles you had to overcome to not pay. Are you in a law profession, or have someone who is? Also, what kind of troubles, if any, did you run into when you stopped paying income tax? How long have you gone without paying income tax?</p>

<p>I&#39;m curious to your personal story with this, as it is obviously unique and interesting.</p>

<p>Legal or not (I have not finished the book, but will in the next couple days) I&#39;m just curious how difficult it is for the &quot;average person&quot; to accomplish this, and if you ran into the same legal circus that Schiff did.</p>

<p>You really should at least attempt to understand what you are arguing about before you say something that makes it obvious you are completely ignorant of how these services are paid for.</p>

<p>First and foremost the Income taxes you pay DO NOT FUND ANYTHING except the further control and enslavement of the entire world by the owners of the country and nearly every other one on the face of the earth to.</p>

<p>Not worth repeating...and &gt;wrong&lt;...</p>

<p>If you don&#39;t think federal funding makes it to the state level you are mistaken. Federal funds get appropriated via requests from the state legislature. New Orleans, for example, got a lot of federal funding when Katrina hit.</p>

<p>Every year a lot of local programs; schools, interstates, parks and rec, and all kinds of projects get a chunk of federal funding, to subsidize their state and local taxes.</p>

<p>This has nothing to do with wether he does or does not have to pay income tax, but if he did, part of that would make it down to the state and municipal level.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>allow me to clarify--the federal funds that make it to state level: show me where it says those come from income tax dollars...</p>

<p>edit: to my best research, it seems there is plenty of evidence that lends credence <em>and validation</em> to NotTheDude&#39;s experience and claims..the fed, the irs, and income tax are <em>all</em> shams and deceptions which cheat the People--and that is their <em>sole</em> purpose...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>some funds do come from the Federal level, but AGAIN they are funds that really don&#39;t exist, except numbers in a computer by the federal reserve, then by our blood, sweat, and tears, through our work, we take the money and make it real, paying a DEAR PRICE for our ignorance.</p>

<p>also, AGAIN, the money you pay in Income taxes DOES NOT GO TO THE TREASURY TO FUND ANYTHING, it is sent directly to the Federal Reserve to pay INTEREST ONLY on these illegal loans to the Federal Government.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Very similar to something I got told by a very smart lady who&#39;d been hip to this stuff probably as long as I&#39;ve been alive: &quot;You&#39;re never going to convince any one of anything so don&#39;t bother trying.&quot;</p>

<p>One reason this stuck with me was that, while I was a 9/11 skeptic by early &#39;02, no one convinced me.  In fact when a friend with an ahead of the curve Prof mentioned this, I gave basically the polite version of &quot;that&#39;s stupid&quot; that I get from the nicer anti-skeptics.  </p>

<p>I came around, not because someone argued with me over it, but because I got a fairly good flow of questioning documents that I could clearly assess on my own time.  So I did.</p>

<p>i meant it somewhat, i think, the way you took it--and i meant no disrespect, either...the older, more experienced one becomes, the more one sees the truth of the OP&#39;s title, and the more one begins to use it to make life, shall we say, <em>easier</em>--on ourselves--<em>and others</em>...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>perhaps it is the perception that is skewed--it isn&#39;t complacency one observes, but <em>acceptance</em>...if you haven&#39;t, i recommend looking into zen/taoist philosophies (as opposed to zen/taoist &quot;religions&quot;); acceptance is much more nuanced and complex, even in it&#39;s simplicity, than one might, at first, realize...</p>

<p>believe me, i am not complacent--particularly when it comes to sharing information...<em>i</em> cannot convince anyone of anything: however, i, myself, <em>have</em> been convinced by information and my own processing of such...it&#39;s <em>not</em> about complacency--you might say it is about expectations (and acceptance)...</p>

<p>the conversations i refer to are those concerning this very topic: my attempts at convincing someone of something, or someone else&#39;s attempts to convince me...i cannot recall a single time when someone has &quot;changed&quot;, my mind, even in the face of overwhelming evidence <em>from them</em>...i have always had to process, over some time, and <em>convince myself</em>...</p>

<p>i understand this may seem like double-speak, or even a red herring...that one particular conversation i mentioned, above?...i had asked my friend for some input and advice--he refused, with this reply, &quot;you&#39;re just going to do what you <em>want</em> to do, anyway...there&#39;s nothing i can <em>say</em> that will help you...&quot;...and he was <em>right</em>...lol...although what he said disturbed, and even angered me, at the time...over some time, and examining my own past actions, i found he was right...this has been repeated, with myself and others, through-out the ensuing years...</p>

<p>i just now had a conversation in which this topic was somewhat involved, with another very close friend...i am unable to convince him of certain things--and i am compelled to present information to him so he can investigate (or not) and make his own <em>informed</em> (or not) choice(s)...and i can do this without anxiety, now, because i no longer <em>expect</em> any particular results from him--not even investigating the information!...i can <em>accept</em> that...</p>

<p>and i believe you are right--the easiest paths <em>are</em> often the paths less wise, and selfish, to take...i can <em>accept</em> that, as well...</p>

<p>peace, amigo or amiga...</p>
