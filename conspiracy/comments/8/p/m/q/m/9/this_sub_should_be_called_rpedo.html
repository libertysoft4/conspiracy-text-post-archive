        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>So, I am pretty new(less than a year) here but I just cannot handle the amount of pedo shit on this sub. Are there any conspiracy sites not flooded with same, tired bullshit related to pizzagate? Especially now that Tucson has started. People are already posting absolute falsehoods(the skull pic may be my favorite) but people will run with them and I don&#39;t want to deal with it any longer. Anyone have any good sites that aren&#39;t flooded with this stuff? I want CIA, DEA, Big Oil, Saudi Arabia, military, 9/11, Bigfoot, or fucking unicorns, idc. Just a good ole conspiracy theory. </p>

<p>The thing that blows my mind with this pedo shit is that, based off of the time that Pizzagate broke, it seems extremely politically motivated to me. And it seems pretty evident that this Tucson thing did not grow to this size organically. There is an agenda here but who/why it is, I have no clue. Hamilton-68 had the Russian bots hard at work with &quot;Human Trafficking&quot; and &quot;Cemex&quot; the past few days though. Are they really Russian bots? I don&#39;t know but whoever it is, loves to troll extremely divisive issues. Even if they aren&#39;t Russian, why would someone be trolling that kind of content? You would kind of think that people on a conspiracy sub would like to know the answer to that, right? But since it has the word Russia in it, they say it is fake because it will somehow make Trump look bad. This is why I am tired of this sub. 90&amp;#37; of the  content is being pushed by people that have no clue they are doing the work *someone* *wants* *them* *to* *do* and it isn&#39;t to stop pedo&#39;s. Then add in the fact that they are so partisan that they don&#39;t want to even try for the truth(hilarious for a conspiracy sub). </p>

<p>Sorry for that rant, just tired of seeing all of this crap and would love some suggestions.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Pedophilia is important from the conspiracy theorist point of view because it is known to occur, and it is also hard to cover up.  The real theory is that the people in power who are corrupted by that power and enact conspiracies to hide the fact, are also morally corrupt and pedophilia is (one of) the most immoral of crimes.  So therefore we believe that pedophilia is the smoking gun that can lead to the top of all the other conspiracies.</p>
