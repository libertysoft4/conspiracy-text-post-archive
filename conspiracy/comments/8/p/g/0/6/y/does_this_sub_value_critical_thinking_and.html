        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>The conspiracy sub can be full of gaslighting and astroturfing. Someone asserts an idea and if people disagree with the idea they are a &quot;shill&quot; or a &quot;bad actor&quot;</p>

<p>So my question is basically if this sub values skepticism or not. </p>

<p>You&#39;ll regularly see comments that say, &quot;Well if you don&#39;t believe this, you must be this!&quot; Or the typical virtue signalling that come from crimes like pedophilia. That if you question anything you are protecting accused pedophiles.  Or if you don&#39;t believe Trump is God then you are shareblue. Or if you like Trump, you&#39;re a Nazi.</p>

<p>Do we value skepticism, or should we just accept every thought/comment as truth under penalty of being accused of being a shill?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It is obvious their is something being discussed on this sub that you wish was not being discussed (censored). </p>

<p>No one is calling you a shill for being skeptical because calling people a shill is against the rules and will result in repercussions. Therefor you are exaggerating or not being truthful. </p>

<p>Most of this sub&#39;s problem is that the original community was ran off by DNC election shills. </p>

<p>Now this sub lacks the old community that would referee discussions to where they were just that, an actual civil discussion/debate. We used to be able to civilly debate people who had totally opposing views. It was a battle of the minds, not a battle of insults and brigade voting.  That was the norm and anyone who tried to do differently stuck out like a sore thumb. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you&#39;re in here primarily to argue against Conspiracy theories then you&#39;re here for the wrong reasons.</p>

<p>Skepticism is fine but obsessively anti-conspiracy skepticism is just trolling.  Your can talk about MSM consensus regurgitation in any of 10,000 subs without anyone bucking you.  If you&#39;re have a problem with that fact, or with /Conspiracy existing as a platform for unpopular, anti-consensus or alternative points of view then you&#39;re doing this sub wrong.</p>

<p>The anti-trump people here are ridiculous, the pro Trump people here who are part of the &quot;cult&quot; stand out because they meme too much.  Memes, no offense, are for low-information grouplings who can&#39;t think for themselves.  </p>

<p>That all being said, I find it hard to believe that people who supposedly don&#39;t trust the government aren&#39;t thrilled with a POTUS who doesn&#39;t trust the government and is likewise not trusted by the government.  How many times have we been blessed with an opportunity to see behind the curtain because of Trump?  Does it even matter at all his point if Trump &quot;sells out&quot; or was always a &quot;sell out&quot;?  We have already seen behind the curtain, more importantly people who didn&#39;t care to &quot;see behind the curtain&quot; have inadvertently &quot;seen behind the curtain&quot;. And such things simply can&#39;t be unseen.</p>

<p>The great Awakening is going to just be another communist revolution, there wouldn&#39;t be anything great about that at all.  You can&#39;t awaken to an old ideology that has been defeated repeatedly, especially when said ideology basically defeated itself.  There wasn&#39;t a 127 day long siege was required to bring down the largest communist empire to have ever existed, it simply failed.  It failed and dragged a bunch of people down with it who probably deserved more out of life is not just &quot;more life&quot;.</p>

<p>So what then &quot;is&quot; the great Awakening?  Is it Trump bringing the deep state into the common vernacular?  Is it Elon Musk blasting the deceptive nature of the media?  Is it some hippy frequency bullshit (obviously I don&#39;t follow this line) about mantras and hallucinogenic drugs allowing your to communicate with the all father?</p>

<p>Can anyone other than Harry Seldon really know what the future holds or what person/event will set free the full potential of humanity?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This &quot;sub&quot; doesn&#39;t necessarily value anything. I feel people need to remember that this forum is a fluid collection of people who have some sort of interest in conspiracy-related topics, and will continue to evolve with different ratios of long-time users, newcomers, conspiracy-deniers, political junkies, and everything else. And this sub most definitely is not a good representation of the true spectrum of conspiracy-related ideas and research at large. </p>

<p>Just don&#39;t take it so seriously. There&#39;s going to be angry illogical folk with an agenda and there will be sincere ones who really are looking for useful info. There&#39;s no reason even to feel that being called a shill is a penalty - if it&#39;s not true who gives a shit? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Lately it depends on the post material and user. It&#39;s not surprising that posts and comments mirroring the same subs that control <a href="/r/all">/r/all</a> are also being upvoted here, while organic posts are lately being downvoted instantly and the comments are deflecting/attacking/labeling. </p>

<p>It&#39;s also important to take note of where the post is crossposted from. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>My take is that if you believe in a conspiracy, you also believe that the proof for the conspiracy is complicated and that the conspirators are actively working to bury it and push a false alternative narrative.</p>

<p>So someone questioning your conspiracy is essentially ignorant of the real facts and likely a victim of counter-programming the false narrative.</p>

<p>It&#39;s easy to see how this leads to personal conflicts -- believers frustrated by what they think are trite skepticism which mostly parrots the conspirators false propaganda, skeptics frustrated by what they think are zealots with unverifiable evidence and leaps of faith.  I&#39;d guess its worse when the conspiracy involves closely-held moral beliefs or a conspiracy involving victimizing innocent people, which only amplifies emotions and generally (IMHO, anyway) undermines the skeptics&#39; belief in the conspiracy believer&#39;s objectivity.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>People would serve themselves well by reading Paul Graham&#39;s <a href="http://paulgraham.com/disagree.html">how to disagree</a>. Most people are unaware that insults will just polarise people and not get anyone anywhere.
It&#39;s not too hard to remain respectful, I think we forget that if we sat down and spoke in person, it could be resolved much better than using just text online.</p>

<p>Does take a lot of thoughtfulness and depends on everyone acting in good faith which is a big assumption to make as often people come from a place of misdirected anger.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>A lot of us do. But that being said if there is a problem with the theory debunk the theory, not belittle the user.
The problem I have with most people is when they disagree they always have to go to calling the other side things like &quot;fucking retarded&quot; rather than saying, &quot;oh that&#39;s wrong if you look at this you can see that is made up info so it&#39;s more likely this is what happened.&quot; </p>

<p>Tdlr: Use evidence to prove a theory wrong and treat others with respect.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you meet the majority of conspiracy theory people they are all just morons who want to feel special. So, that answers your question. There are a few of is on here actually trying to discover truth. </p>

<p>Well id say theres more than a few because at least 1/4 of these posts are solid fact finding truths. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think there is a huge difference between not believing in a conspiracy and holding judgement until you see more info.</p>

<p>A lot of people are really hot around the collar because of what some people purport, but they always post bullshit in here and we just gotta sift.</p>

<p>I just hate being screamed at for sifting through the shit everyone else feels like their hands are too clean for, either provide constructive feedback or not, don&#39;t pretend to be knowledgeable on the issue when they have the same information the rest of the forum has.</p>

<p>People really just need to chill out a bit.</p>
