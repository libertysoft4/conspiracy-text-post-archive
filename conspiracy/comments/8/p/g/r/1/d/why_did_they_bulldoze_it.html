<p>Some guy tries to expose an area where *allegedly children were harmed and I say *allegedly cause I don&#39;t know for certain what happened there, I&#39;m not there.</p>

<p>But they bulldoze the area? What the hell, that is fishy like why would they so quickly bring a bulldozer and wipe the entire area? All humans act the same when they want to get rid of something quickly, we destroy it.</p>

<p>Look man I&#39;m just some dude, no idea what is going on but the bulldozing thing is suspicious in a real way to me cause it&#39;s quite human to quickly destroy something when it poses a threat.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>according to the video of the Patriot being interviewed at the police station by the LT, the cops showed up the day the 911 call was placed, the patriot admits he hid in the tower and watched the cops arrive enter, did not see the cops taking photos, unclear if it was due to distance.  Detectives came back out on Friday, unclear how long they were there.  They left and said it was just a homeless camp. </p>

<p><a href="https://www.facebook.com/1415347948612114/videos/1422911327855776/">Interview here</a></p>

<p>Im not sure where the claim the police wouldn&#39;t show up came from, the patriot was the one that admits in the video he waited several days to call the police.  </p>

<p>In this video they also discuss why the sheriff showed up and detained or questioned 2 members of VOP (not the patriot) someone on I-19 reported seeing 2 men on top of a billboard sign brandishing AR-15s.  This was the day of or day after the patriot was streaming on facebook that any and all patriots need to come down and patrol I19 for traffickers that were trying to remove evidence, look for any trucks pulled over on the side of the road, etc.</p>

<p>Im not sure if the sheriff&#39;s detaining the two VOP members happened in front of local Cemex management but management was present when the father and son showed up and admitted to putting the logs and tarp on top of the tank.  I can imagine even if Cemex isn&#39;t guilty of child trafficking  they would want to do whatever they could to make everyone go away.</p>

<p>But mayor rothschild may have ordered the immediate destruction of incriminating evidence.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you are Cemex would you be worried about a site the police tell you is not a child trafficking camp but just a homeless camp or would you be worried about the guy on facebook telling the world he discovered a child rape camp and it turns out the guy has a criminal record and is not allowed to even own a gun.</p>

<p>Things would have been different if the expert in child trafficking had decided to call the police instead of handing over to someone who may be off his rocker.</p>
