    <div class="md"><p>The main problem with 9/11 debunkers is that they don&#39;t seem to understand that there is a very good reason to be suspicious of the anglo-american establishment and their intelligence agencies when it comes to war-enabling events such as 9/11.</p>

<p>There is a long and documented history of false flag and black operations being used to initiate wars of conquest. Debunkers seem unwilling to even acknowledge this fact. I guess it just doesn&#39;t fit into their <strong>AMERICA - FUCK YEAH!</strong> worldview.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No.  I am all for being suspicious of the government/establishment pretty much everything.  I have a degree in History, and have been reading about conspiracy theories for 10 plus years (believing them for many), so I have at least a basic understanding of history and the events you speak of, and I assure you I am not of the America, Fuck Yhea mindset.  I do not think the government is inherently good or working in society&#39;s best interests.  I am anti war, anti torture, and I probably share a similar world view with many here.  As a debunker I am not unique, painting with such a broad brush is a mistake.  How do you feel when the ad hom &quot;truthers living in their mothers basement, or pot smoking truther is used?&quot;   Basing your view of an opposing  ideology or group on stereotypes is a quick way to stifle intellect.</p>

<p>The issue with 9/11 debunkers isn&#39;t one of people not understanding or accepting the motives you speak of, or even an opposing political/world view its that the majority of truther arguments simply do not stand under scrutiny.  Take this thread, the topic was thermite; truthers have misrepresented what the paper actually said, to the point people now assert that thermite was definitively found at GZ.  You, as a truther, should find the fact that this misinformation is being added to the truther lexicon in spite of it being false troubling.  Many debunkers (and truthes) are highly skeptical of Jones&#39; findings, so when people parrot them off a gospel they may be dismissed in many circles, and it has nothing to do with someones view of history.  I think people who claim to be skeptical should exercise the same level of skepticism they do on Conspiracy evidence, that they do on offical versions, and vice versa.  </p>

<p>What does operation northwoods or the gulf of tonkin add to the discussion on thermite? (not referring to your post)  Nothing yet bringing them up is supposed to somehow add to the veracity of a science paper.  Discussions are often littered with these red herrings, and serve to distract from what the topic at hand is, namely the Bentham article.</p>

<p>I do. If you look through my comment history you&#39;ll see that I have never asserted that the WTC buildings were imploded. I keep a somewhat open mind on the subject but I&#39;ve yet to see any compelling evidence. I&#39;m more interested in the ties between the mujihadeen, ISI, CIA, Mossad and other secret societies and their hidden influence in historic and unfolding events. I&#39;m a LIHOP truther, not a space-lasers truther.</p>

<p>The only reason I chime in on such threads is to troll the more aggressive &quot;debunkers&quot; like Jerkimer.</p>

<p>Thankfully you are not one of those people, so +1 for an excellent reply.</p>

<p>&quot;I think this point needs to be addressed b/c if you haven&#39;t taken time to explore the <a href="http://www.benthlam.org">www.benthlam.org</a> site you would not realize that there are hundreds if not thousands of papers that have been submitted and published.</p>

<p>Papers on every possible thing you can possibly imagine most are technical and/or field specific.</p>

<p>Listening to Cam&#39;s portrayal of this journal you would think that this is some up start journal with no one except wild researchers endeavors that would never be published anywhere else and not only that they paid big money just to get it done.</p>

<p>It couldn&#39;t be further from the truth. I encourage anyone to check the site yourself and look at there archives.</p>

<p>Cam wants us to think that out of all these several hundred papers that have been published that some how THIS ONE (Jones&amp;Co&#39;s Paper) was able to by pass all of the editors and was published under their noses.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not buying it, especially from someone who would spend his dying breath defending the government.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No.  I am all for being suspicious of the government/establishment pretty much everything.  I have a degree in History, and have been reading about conspiracy theories for 10 plus years (believing them for many), so I have at least a basic understanding of history and the events you speak of, and I assure you I am not of the America, Fuck Yhea mindset.  I do not think the government is inherently good or working in society&#39;s best interests.  I am anti war, anti torture, and I probably share a similar world view with many here.  As a debunker I am not unique, painting with such a broad brush is a mistake.  How do you feel when the ad hom &quot;truthers living in their mothers basement, or pot smoking truther is used?&quot;   Basing your view of an opposing  ideology or group on stereotypes is a quick way to stifle intellect.</p>

<p>The issue with 9/11 debunkers isn&#39;t one of people not understanding or accepting the motives you speak of, or even an opposing political/world view its that the majority of truther arguments simply do not stand under scrutiny.  Take this thread, the topic was thermite; truthers have misrepresented what the paper actually said, to the point people now assert that thermite was definitively found at GZ.  You, as a truther, should find the fact that this misinformation is being added to the truther lexicon in spite of it being false troubling.  Many debunkers (and truthes) are highly skeptical of Jones&#39; findings, so when people parrot them off a gospel they may be dismissed in many circles, and it has nothing to do with someones view of history.  I think people who claim to be skeptical should exercise the same level of skepticism they do on Conspiracy evidence, that they do on offical versions, and vice versa.  </p>

<p>What does operation northwoods or the gulf of tonkin add to the discussion on thermite? (not referring to your post)  Nothing yet bringing them up is supposed to somehow add to the veracity of a science paper.  Discussions are often littered with these red herrings, and serve to distract from what the topic at hand is, namely the Bentham article.</p>
