The thought of weaponized sound or microwaves causing different symptoms is horrifying. This would mean that our cell phones could be subtly leaking certain frequencies that we easily absorb. I mean just prior to writing this post, my phone was in my pocket, center point of basically my body. If someone decided they want to use my phone to transmit a certain frequency, my body would easily absorb it. I’m not saying for certain they are doing this, I’m saying if it has been proven that there are attacks of this nature, then we are dealing with a whole new dangerous class of weapons. At least with a gun you are able to see the bullet, with this it would be as invisible as WIFI is.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The Cubans are not attacking U.S. &quot;diplomats&quot; (or even CIA criminals working under &quot;diplomatic&quot; cover) with sub-sonic weapons. Lol. There&#39;s another explanation. And if anything, it&#39;s the other way around. I recall reading somewhere years ago that the U.S. has attacked Cuban society with biological weapons and with several other kinds of exotic weapons.</p>

<p>The Cubans want normalized relations with us, as does every other innocent nation we&#39;ve been attacking since the 1950s.</p>

<p>Anything is more likely than &quot;the Cubans did it.&quot;</p>

<p>Just when Obama had begun to normalize economic trade with Cuba after 58 long years, this new anti-Cuban accusation pops up, possibly throwing a monkey wrench into things, and delaying normalization.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, I guess I like how you&#39;re trying to obfuscate things.  Here&#39;s what your favorite CIAstream newspaper The Washington Post says: </p>

<p>&quot;Separately, a group of researchers at the University of Michigan suggested that <em>ultrasound</em> signals from two or more [U.S. embassy] transmitters could have accidentally interfered with each other to produce an audible signal.&quot; [end quote]</p>

<p>Clicking on the U. of Michigan study, we see: </p>

<p>&quot;Sources of Ultrasound.  There are many potential sources of ultrasound in office, home, and hotel environments.  Energy efficient buildings often use ultrasonic room occupancy sensors in every room (Figure 1).   Ultrasonic emitters can repel rodents and other pests.   HVAC systems and other utilities with pumps or compressors can vibrate entire buildings.  Certain burglar alarm
sensors, security cameras, and automated doors use ultrasound for detection of movement.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;The State Department has said it suspects the stricken diplomats in Cuba were purposely targeted for an attack. In response, it downsized the U.S. diplomatic staff in Havana and prohibited families from joining the diplomats who stayed. The United States also expelled 15 Cuban diplomats in retaliation, accusing Cuba of failing to protect American envoys.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have first hand experience with this.</p>

<p>The ringing is a &quot;line&quot; its not actually a weapon.  Its an open communications system that uses a focalized frequency (meaning Analog sound through a multiple freincy channel &#39;parameteic sound&#39;)  its a way to send messages to individuals or a group of people without wires ,decryption devices or mass detection.</p>

<p>How do I know.</p>

<p>Unlucky test subject.</p>

<p>Started hearing the same tones near my home (a.k.a. curfew tones)  after focusing in on it I began hearing speech to speech. Two people talking to one another)</p>
