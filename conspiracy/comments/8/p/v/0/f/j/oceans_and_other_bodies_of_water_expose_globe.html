        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>water finding level is one of the clearest indications that the earth isn&#39;t a sphere. The notion that a body of water, like the ocean, curves and follows the shape of a sphere is absurd. (And no, we are not talking about surface tension and water droplets tendency to form spheres. that is something else entirely)</p>

<p>Though experiment: dig a canal that precisely follows the supposed curvature of the earth. fill the canal with water. what happens? does the water surface find level? or does the surface bulge out follow the curvature of the earth?</p>

<p>subjecting a contained volume of water to angular velocity, the water surface perpendicular to the trajectory will always level out to be flat. it does not matter what shape the underlying container is. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s like saying &quot;I&#39;m not a human being, I&#39;m a collection of feelings and experiences&quot;.  It&#39;s not technically wrong (unless we start getting into semantic discussions about your chosen terminology), but it&#39;s an incomplete picture of reality.  </p>

<p>I can&#39;t imagine I will ever convince you otherwise, because to be honest every flat-earth-type I&#39;ve ever spoken with has had the same attitude of working backward from their own preconceived conclusion.  No proof can possible exist that you won&#39;t hand wave away as irrelevant, wrong, or sourced from the &quot;other&quot;, be it evil NASA scientists or globalists or shit, even the jews.  You believe your own vision and backward inferences more thoroughly explain the observable universe than literal thousands of years of scientific inquest.  </p>

<p>I&#39;d love to see some of the proofs of your claims, but I&#39;m afraid that they&#39;ll mostly be youtube videos that encourage you to &quot;make up your own mind&quot;, as if the mathematical proofs and observable phenomena explained by modern physics at both the human and astronomical scales should be discarded in favour of conjecture that is sold as equally valid.  It&#39;s unfortunate there are so many people out there willing to take advantage of the gullibility of those with severe predilections for conspiratorial or contrarian ways of thought.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>the gullibility lies in those who believe what others tell them, without testing and experiencing those claims for themselves.</p>

<p>A thousand years of &quot;scientific conquest&quot;, or a million years, that has no bearing on the truth. scientific theories are built upon the groundwork theories of those who came before them. testing the established conclusions and interpretations upon which new theories are built is a must. not an option.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The entire world we live in is based on that scientific inquest (not &quot;conquest&quot;, not sure if that was a fruedian slip on your part).  We are communicating on computers over an international network maintained via constant supply of electricity generated by a multitude of methods.  All of these things are the result of accumulated scientific knowledge spanning hundreds of years of testing and proof.  This is the truth.  This is the sort of thing you will hand-wave away.  This is the sort of thing which you cannot provide for your worldview.  Proof.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t expect people to simply believe everything someone says to them.  I do, however, expect them not to dismiss the evidence and proof provided when that proof is concrete, scientifically tested, and forms the basis of common understanding about the physical laws and constraints of our universe.  The fact is that I, having had at least some basic education in the methods through which others have dedicated years to the pursuit and advancement of scientific knowledge, am willing to accept that those people, having established hypotheses, tested and further refined those hypotheses through observation and the scientific method, are able to make conclusions that are the best possible explanation for the world we live in, without having to do that work myself.  </p>

<p>I would like to see through what methods you have reached your conclusion. Give me the tests that, when performed myself, would lead me to the same logical conclusions as you have reached.  My guess is that you cannot, but I would love to be proven wrong here, but the ramifications would be so insanely far-reaching that it baffles me that the most brilliant minds mankind has put forth would not have reached this conclusion first.</p>

<p>And my point is, does it have to be gravity that&#39;s holding you here. And a leg isn&#39;t propulsion dude. Aside from jumping, which applies a maximum amount of velocity achieving a certain height. Not withheld because of gravity. We don&#39;t have wings or rockets attached to us, hence we can&#39;t fly. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Cool, this is interesting, and I do agree that we could very well be living in a simulation, but your previous arguments were specious at best, especially those relating to brain chemistry and the presence of electricity in the nervous system.  Should we be living in a simulation, electricity in the nervous system would also be simulated, and not at all necessarily proof of anything.  </p>

<p>Moreover, even if we were living in a simulation, every mathematical and physical model points to a spherical earth, which was the point of the conversation to begin with.  Simulation or not.  Ultimately, any sufficiently advanced simulation being indistinguishable from reality, it makes no difference whether our existence is in the form we believe it to be, because our observable universe (real or not) still obeys the laws which we are able to discern via testing various hypotheses.  All of these point conclusively to a spherical earth, to the point where there is zero scientific uncertainty.  It is fact.</p>

This is the problem with flat-earthers, you are choosing which facts you do or do not recognize, and only applying facts that appeal to your theory. Which is all this is, a theory.

    <div class="md"><p>Look man, continue your pursuit of the truth by all means, but maybe apply that to something legitimate. You&#39;ll find very little love on this sub for flat Earth theories, because there is nothing to back up the claims. If you have actual facts to support your theory, I&#39;m sure we would love to hear them, but &quot;water should flow around a spherical earth, so Earth is flat&quot; is simply not a formulated theory, it&#39;s more of a shower thought. 
Here&#39;s something to chew on; Gravity pulls everything towards the center of the planet, which almost perfectly simulates a flat surface from our perspective. Water would act exactly the same, even settle in the same places, wether it&#39;s on a sphere effected by gravity, or a flat surface effected by gravity. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>The Transglobe Expedition was the first expedition to make a circumpolar navigation, traveling the world &quot;vertically&quot; traversing both of the poles using only surface transport.</p>

<p>Starting in 1979 from Greenwich in the United Kingdom, adventurers Sir Ranulph Fiennes and Charles R. Burton went south, arriving at the South Pole on 15 December 1980. Over the next 14 months, they went north again, reaching the North Pole on 11 April 1982. Travelling south once more, they arrived again in Greenwich on 29 August 1982.[1]</p>

<p>Ranulph Fiennes would laugh in the face of idiots like OP. He&#39;s done the things they say can&#39;t be done. He&#39;s done it while they sit on their stupid asses and theorise about shit they have never and will never actually put to the test because they are too stupid to ever pull it off.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There are much greater conspiracies out there that have a very real effect on every individuals day to day life that don&#39;t make any sense or matter if flat earth is true. Regardless of the terrible logic used by most that believe it, regardless of the myriad of evidence contradicting is, or the common sense, it just isn&#39;t flat. I know how you feel. That you&#39;ve been lied to, that all the information you get is bullshit. You&#39;re in the beginning of a mass change and you quantify that as &quot;everything is bullshit except the most ridiculous that is on the fringe and everyone tries to debunk.&quot; it&#39;s a common way of thinking, but a dangerous one. Please do some basic research on the known physics of this world before you make ideas on the unknown physics. </p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>does the water surface find level? or does the surface bulge out follow the curvature of the earth?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Here is the accurate answer - BOTH.</p>

<p>To be &quot;level&quot;, a surface has to be perpendicular to the direction of gravity. On a spherical planet, the direction of gravity is towards the center of the sphere so that it is equidistant from the center at all points of its surface.</p>

<p>In order to stay level on a spherical planet, water must bend around the sphere, adopting a spherical shape slightly larger than the spherical shape of the planet.</p>

<p>You&#39;re thinking about this incorrectly.  Water doesn&#39;t find its level, and never has.  Water finds equilibrium with the forces acting on it, all mater does.  It&#39;s better, and more accurate, to think about the forces acting on the water at any particular point, and where they will eventually cancel out.</p>
