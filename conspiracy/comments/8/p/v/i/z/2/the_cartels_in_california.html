    <div class="md"><p>California had medical for a long time, is it possible that cartels got involved in the supply chain for what was otherwise up front legit medical dispensaries, running their own grow operations and then extorting new medical and now recreational grow operations?</p>

<p>In the early days of medical I can see them doing this, but the reach seems limited.  California is a big state -- geography and population, lots of demand and lots of places to run a grow operation that would be very hard to find.  Just the industrial parks of Anaheim alone seem to go on forever.  Ultimately the cartels would face the same problems as the cops -- too much opportunity and space, not enough intel and manpower.</p>

<p>I am not talking about Chicago gangs, I am talking about Mexican cartels in Chicago. Read a bit, maybe do some research, shit is bad here. Chicago is the heart of yhe heroin highway. I cant buy a quarter of weed without being worried ot is cartel shit. </p>

<p>Its unfortunate but true. I don&#39;t need to live in CA to believe this.. the people questioning this confuse me. With organized crime intelligence, money, etc. why so hard to believe they cant get into the legal business or grow under the radar in legal states?</p>

<p>I wonder how much of this is being subverted by &quot;lone gunman&quot; individual smugglers.  A 1 gram vaporizer cartridge can last a low-level recreational smoker a month, call it equal to an 1/8 of quality flower.  If some guy goes to a legal state and brings home 10 vape carts for himself and friends, he&#39;s now undermining the value of cartel smuggling, and its simpler and lower risk than flower due to the compact and low odor nature of concentrates.  And a LOT of people visit legal states, lots of people I know in my non-legal, non-bordering-legal state have vapes or edibles from legal states brought back by friends.</p>

<p>If I had to hazard a guess, a lot of leakage from legal states is this kind of &quot;tourist souvenir&quot; exfiltration.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I would tend to agree with you about the vape pens and edibles, although those may actually be arguably easier for cartels to get into. The thing is theyre getting involved in the industry both above the board and below.</p>

<p>Legalization is hurting their ability to maximize profits off marijuana sales, dont doubt that. That said they just innovate and the point of the OP I think, is that they are deep into the industry than people may want to think or see. </p>

<p>The ONLY answer is make everything above the board and regulated because otherwise there&#39;s always gonna be major revenue for them off it.</p>

<p>But you should look into those carts, while they are great and I like to keep a couple around, they also are easy to make from waste material.</p>

<p>The reality is a little research would lead anyone to the conclusion that we are not at the point where the cartels and organized crime is taking a hit from legal states. I&#39;ve always heard the black market options, legal state or not, are way cheaper. People are gonna stick with their dealers if they had a decent dealer. Thankfully for people youre talking about; non-frequent smokers legalization makes things safer/feel safer and they are probably least likely to get stuff that the DTO had a hand in moving around.</p>

<p>&quot;Lone Gunman&quot; types arent making a dent in shit though, although their tons and tons of them. Thing is, how can someone know theyre not getting stuff they supplied to whoever theyre getting these things from.</p>

<p>LAST, people need to be careful as fuck in illegal states taking edibles or puffing vape carts that they didnt make themselves or trust the dealer to not be getting really cheap carts. You dont want cheap concentrates of any type.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve never understood this.  Some people must be enjoying the most optimistic version of &quot;decent dealer&quot; ever, because for most people &quot;decent dealer&quot; means a guy who <em>usually</em> has decent bags of one kind of bud that weigh out and aren&#39;t at the maximum black market price and can be gotten ahold of and the transaction concluded within 36 hours, all without scaring your neighbors or having to hang out at his place with his stoner friends.</p>

<p>I would trade that reliable-but-annoying setup for 3-4x price increases if got me the high-line shops you find in California and Colorado with massive selection, consistent pricing and quality and normal business hours.  I mean fuck capitalism, but it&#39;s done some magical shit with pot in legal states.</p>

<p>Yeah, so is beer and many other things but I don&#39;t have the time to deal with it.  Like so many other things, I&#39;m willing to trade my money for convenience when it seems right.</p>
