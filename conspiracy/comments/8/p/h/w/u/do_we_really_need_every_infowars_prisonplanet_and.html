    <div class="md"><p>It just seems that in the past 2 weeks this /r/ has become a spam site for Alex Jones articles.  There are few few comments in them an usually less than 8 upvotes.  Just wondering if anyone else finds this trend troublesome.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I find it troublesome as well. I consider it spam at this point. There is one person doing it, and from his profile history it&#39;s hard to tell if the guy even sleeps. It&#39;s just round the clock commenting, trolling, and posting of Prison Planet and Info Wars articles to multiple subreddits.</p>

<p>It just dilutes all the content here, and yes it is very irritating. I expect people to post articles from those sites in this subreddit, don&#39;t get me wrong, I just don&#39;t expect them to submit EVERY article from those sites. Half of them aren&#39;t even currently relevant.</p>

<p>It&#39;s just one user doing it, and it&#39;s the same person that has caused problems in other reddits. You&#39;ll notice after we had the 911Truther moderation discussion, he stopped spamming there, because it became against the rules. Now he is doing the exact same thing to this subreddit.</p>

<p>He can change account names every two weeks, but the characteristics and sensationalism of his headlines and comments are very easy to spot.</p>

<p>Herkimer, You really need to put to rest this obsession with PrisonPlanet, Alex Jones and 9/11 Truth. You feign to disagree with them, so why don&#39;t you just take off? Nobody has chained you to Reddit (except your employer: USCENTCOM, of course). Get a fucking life, or admit the truth, you worthless loathsome piece of government refuse!</p>
