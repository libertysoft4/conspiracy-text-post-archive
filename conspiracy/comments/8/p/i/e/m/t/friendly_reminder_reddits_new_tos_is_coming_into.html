<p>I am not leaving Reddit but I will not host as much &quot;content&quot; on here as I used to. AKA I will be linking to more off site platforms to share ideas/concepts and save text/comments for crucial context and awareness. Be careful what you post onto Reddit from here on out.... </p>

Users now subscribe to echo chamber subreddits then slowly lose (or fail to develop) the ability to agree to disagree and have rational fact based discussions without hostility.

    <div class="md"><p>this is spooky, thanks for posting</p>

<p>i already have suspected that things like this are in place, it is especially valuable for them to get the information of people who think they are legally protected and or unwatched.  </p>

<p>that they are saying it is legal for them to impersonate you is like saying, &#39;if you get really popular on here, we may just steal your account so we can commodify your work&#39;  </p>

<p>and this is inherent breach of trust, the worst of the internet, beyond the pale.  </p>

<p>the direction things should be going is for more verification of users who want to establish themselves as writers, more ways for individuals to earn credibility and even currency for what they say. </p>

<p>All of this stuff is headed backwards towards some real nazi-sounding sheisty shit, though control, infinite manipulation, destruction of fact and essentially the end of the individual on the internet. </p>

<p>you are either connected to an institution that provides you a digital platform, or you are a minnow swimming in the mouth of a shark, who will be eaten as soon as it(read: you, me, us) reach a certain size. </p>

<p>so yes, reddit is lost and has been.  peter sunde says the entire internet is lost, that it&#39;s&#39; already become a monster and i find it difficult to agree with that.  </p>

<p>we are facing the death of individual liberty and speech in our lifetime.  </p>

<p>more and more i think people like Tim Russert and Michael Hastings and Paul Wellstone and Aaron Schwartz died because they reached this size and disappeared down the belly.  </p>

<p>saidit, voat, steemit, all look just as comprimsed to me. </p>

<p>and this is why, i believe, elon musk is talking about a whole new sort of platform for journalism and debate.  it is also why i saw all of this in 2002 and wrote a book i couldn&#39;t get anybody to read.  </p>

<p>so my old account <a href="/u/mindhawk">/u/mindhawk</a> is locked, you can compare this at snoopsnoo to see the writing of that account and this is the same wordcloud.  and i know the comments over there very well, that&#39;s my canary in the coal mind, mindhawk&#39;s(my) original reddit account is supposed to be locked forever and im testing to see how long it stays up and if it ever changes, so far so good.  </p>

<p>this time around with this account, despite my apparent love of the word &#39;people&#39; i meet very few other accts who are prepared to actually have an exchange of thought rather than shove the thread in one direction briefly, usually a shitty direction, before bailing forever on the topic.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>yeah it is pretty easy to do and I included a link on how to do it in my main OP up above</p>

<p>I did it on old accounts just so nothing could be harvested or &quot;usable&quot;</p>

<p>im leaving this account alone but if you feel like deleting comments I would. Also adds safety for yourself, it&#39;s good to delete every so often, we sometimes share more than we mean to and it can make it easier to doxx us</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree 100%</p>

<p>We have ample reports and evidence of Reddit and other social media platforms already doing this kind of stuff</p>

<p>this is pretty much them just legally covering that behaviour </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I am not attempting to scare anyone mate just saying it as it is</p>

<p>I mean technically you can lose your job over a number of things but if you read the TOS it says all of this.</p>

<p>In all honesty I am sure a lot of this was already happening this is just them legally covering themselves </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m starting to look for the next platform, this place holds a special place in my heart but it rarely satisfies my desires for intelligent discord anymore. I&#39;ve changed and searched for subs but I&#39;m not finding it anymore. It&#39;s just like I woke up one day and reddit had changed, kind of like looking at a partner and realizing you don&#39;t love them anymore lol. </p>
