        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I find his death suspicious for a number of reasons. </p>

<ol>
<li><p>He said if he was ever going to go out, it&#39;d be with Heroin. He also said in recent interviews he wouldn&#39;t kill himself because he has a 11 year old daughter and wants to live for her. </p></li>
<li><p>His former girlfriend Asia Argento accused Harvey Weinstein of rape. This could be a pedogate coverup, as Bourdain likes to do expose`s about touchy subjects. </p></li>
<li><p>He just recently released a video exposing the Armenian Genocide. </p></li>
<li><p>There is lots of talk he is a potential CIA asset, given his ascent to CNN and his connections</p></li>
</ol>

<p>If he was about to do a big expose` about Weinstein or a pedo group, I could see them taking him out for this. </p>

<p>Also he died in Paris. </p>

<p>Also just a week ago, Kate Spade died of suicide by hanging, who was married to David Spade&#39;s brother. </p>

<p>Also 160 children were just found and released from a pedo ring in Atlanta. CNN (Bourdian&#39;s network) is basically refusing to cover this on their news coverage. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t believe in the Q stuff, but Q said this is &quot;suicide week&quot; </p>

<p>Also the Dutch Queen&#39;s sister just committed suicide by hanging as well, at the age of 33: <a href="https://nypost.com/2018/06/07/dutch-queen-maximas-sister-found-dead-in-apparent-suicide/">https://nypost.com/2018/06/07/dutch-queen-maximas-sister-found-dead-in-apparent-suicide/</a></p>

<p>This is a family that has heavy Rothschild connections. </p>

<p>Something screwy is going on here. I don&#39;t believe Bourdain killed himself by hanging. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Just a feeling. If even 20% of what&#39;s claimed around here about what celebrities and politicians do behind closed doors is true, and the truth really is about to come to light soon, a lot of people are going to suicide before the truth comes out. </p>

<p>Of course, the recent suicides could also be completely coincidental in which case no more will follow and this is just a sad week. I probably just got carried away tbh. Because the &quot;suicide before bad reveal&quot; would mean something nasty is about to come out about Bourdain, which seems unlikely.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t mean to appear to be singling your comment and having a go at you mate. It&#39;s just that what you&#39;ve said is uneducated and unfortunately quite commonly repeated by people. </p>

<p>Unfortunately, I&#39;m all to well aware and experienced in the field of suicide, having had a few really good friends lose the battle over the years and witnessing a few others seemingly right on the edge.</p>

<p>Humans are irrational and highly illogical to begin with and as such, the act of suicide is largely impulsive and spur of the moment. The thought of suicide may have lingered from minutes to years in victims but rarely is the act well prepared. </p>

<p>As for the method, experts conducted a study that surmised a success rate of around 49% and a time frame of 1hr and 15min length of time to produce death via drug overdose. It&#39;s rarely successful in and of itself and along with the huge time frame in which you may be found and resuscitated death via overdose is largely accidental. Death via hanging is 89% successful with a time frame of 7min. Only death via shotgun and being hit by a train increases the odds(+7-10%) of being successful with any significance.</p>

<p>There needs to be greater awareness and consciousness that it&#39;s suicide we&#39;re talking about here. It&#39;s very action transcends wealth, status, race or creed and is a totally leveling act among victims, there is no &#39;outrivaling&#39; one and other. Because of it&#39;s impulsiveness one could argue in a lot of cases the victim is suffering not just emotionally but also suffering temporary &#39;insanity&#39;.</p>

<p>Suicide is largely the &#39;unspoken&#39; epidemic that not one country the world over is immune from.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I disagree. With experience in both drugs and ju-jitsu, being largely clean of drugs and in a foreign city, it doesn&#39;t seem far fetched to think he chose to hang himself. ODing is likely to result in permanently damage but not necessarily death. Getting enough drugs to kill himself painlessly in a foreign city could also be problematic. Ju Jitsu teaches a person exactly how to choke somebody out, how quickly it works and how painless it can be, it&#39;s a near sure thing for someone like him. When he has said in the past he&#39;d like to go out with a massive drug overdose I think there could have been a ring of thruth to all that, but age and experience probably taught him how problematic that could be. Not to mention, if he was serious about wanting to die he may have been in no mood for one last party. All that being said, if there is foul play at hand here, I&#39;d guess sure whoever did the job has all the psychological profiles surrounding this kind of shit down pat. </p>

<p>11lbs of pressure on a properly tied noose will knock you out in less than 15 seconds.  It&#39;s like being put in a sleeper hold.  Mildly uncomfortable and then you black out.  It takes much longer for you to actually die, but you aren&#39;t awake for any of that.</p>

<p>You seem to be throwing every conspiracy in the book against the wall and hoping something will stick.</p>

<p>Not everything is a super secret conspiracy. The fact that Bourdain even discussed suicide publicly tells you that he suffers from depression and is suicidal at times.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>We still need the toxicology report. We haven’t heard from his friend who found him. We haven’t heard from the numerous people who were working on the show with him when he killed himself. Perhaps video leaked of the show in progress for us to scrutinize for signs of depression.</p>

<p>Chris Cornell literally walked off stage from a sold out show and hung himself. It isn’t out of the question that Bourdain was depressed, may have relapsed and hung himself.</p>

<p>Maybe he meant to OD on heroin but didn’t take enough. I can speak from experience from when I tried to take a lethal dose of heroin and woke up on the street, hanging out of my car and puked everywhere. I was extremely disappointed that I didn’t kill myself. It made me even sadder that I was in a semi-public place and apparently everyone just walked around the “crime scene” without stopping to help.</p>

<p>Hanging is the next step if OD doesn’t work. </p>

<p>There will be more to the story. There always is.</p>

<p>Give the man some respect today and investigate tomorrow when more information comes out.</p>

But we must also consider that when these things come out, they will be manipulated by the same media that has been lying to us for decades. The same media essentially owned by the CIA... the media owned by the people who want the story not to come out, who want it framed as a suicide. </p>

<p>I&#39;m not discounting the possibility he killed himself. But based on what I know so far, I&#39;d say there&#39;s a 60% chance it was a murder and a 40% chance it was a suicide. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It breaks my heart that the world broke Anthony Bourdain.</p>

<p>I don’t believe he was directly murdered.</p>

<p>I think he was a genuinely good soul and the state of the world, based on his extensive travels, and the terrible conditions and inequities finally got to him.</p>

<p>The bigger, perhaps eugenics point of view, is to make us all feel hopeless until we just off ourselves.</p>

<p>Anthony Bourdain was on the side of light. He’s been there, done that and seen it all. </p>

<p>He knows that wealth does not equal happiness because he’s been in places of abject poverty filled with happy people.</p>

<p>The West is toxic with consumerism. We believe “things” will make us happy but those “things” come at a cost. Usually to some third world country somewhere.</p>

<p>Anthony’s death is a tragedy. He showed us the far flung regions of the world, most of which were exploited by the west for our consumption.</p>

<p>Knowing that would kill any good person. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Conspiracy or not, Bourdain&#39;s death is tragic. He was an inspiration, a champion of truth and he struck an accessible human cord that many benefited from.</p>

<p>But, nothing about this death sits well. An engineered distraction? Maybe. Not every conspiracy can align perfectly, but what was the hot topic before this yet another alleged celebrity suicide-by-hanging? The strange episode of child-trafficking in AZ. </p>

<p>Maybe we need to retroactively investigate our own posts (even though this is my first) regarding conspiracies in the days and weeks leading up to Chester Bennington&#39;s death; the most discussed cases before Chris Cornell&#39;s alleged hanging, Paul Walker&#39;s strange drone strike... Any celebrity death that seems suspicious could be a diversion tactic for the cases we discuss gaining steam.</p>

<p>Maybe we can narrow down the suspect list to a few perpetrators. It&#39;s my belief, however, that NXIVM, Lolita Express, Weinstein and the global elite cabal&#39;s ritual enslavement and abuse of minors will keep coming up, and that&#39;s the same rabbit hole we&#39;re constantly negotiating. </p>

<p>Even if one of these suicides is legitimate, the rest aren&#39;t. That flies in the face of reason. To be a coincidence that Bourdain died in the midst of Argento&#39;s Weinstein claims, Bourdain&#39;s own condemnations of Kissinger and events surrounding the #ME TOO movement, as well as the Arizona camp connection to CEMEX and the Clinton Global Initiative is highly unlikely. There&#39;s just too much evidence here to ignore. Throw Boy&#39;s Town in there too.</p>

<p>If Bourdain killed himself because of Asia&#39;s infidelity, that&#39;s heartbreaking. If there&#39;s no silence campaign by elite pedophiles with the means and the will to kill whomever they wish, that&#39;s impossible. </p>

<p>R.I.P. Anthony Bourdain </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Great post. RIP Anthony. I was just starting to get in to his TV show, he was such an interesting person who took TV in directions I&#39;ve never seen before. When he came out with the episode about the Armenian genocide, while travelling to the area, I knew he was something special. It takes a lot of courage to speak against injustice like that. And it seems those who speak out against injustice and rise to prominence suffer untimely ends caused by state actors, like JFK and MLK Jr for example. Or Aaron Swartz, who made reddit. </p>

<p>This is a sick world, and my hope is that one day we humans, as the culture of the world that we are, can use that power to learn to heal. </p>

<p>It&#39;s amazing how the Zionists think they speak for all Jews, and how hard they work to maintain that illusion. I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if Mossad or CIA did this. </p>

Worth mentioning that the mouse character dons a <strong>red turtleneck, not a scarf</strong>. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Andy Spade threw on the bizarre disguise and left his Park Avenue home just after 8:30 a.m. — two days after his wife, Kate, was found dead in the apartment.</p>

<p>The mask — Bernard, voiced by Bob Newhart in the 1977 cartoon movie, “The Rescuers” — depicts the fictional character with a grinning bucktoothed face, black whiskers, wearing a red newsboy cap and matching turtleneck.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It obviously makes sense for someone who&#39;s mourning to want to stay away from press/even act irrationally in order to have the most privacy possible. That being said, you&#39;d think he would realize that walking out in something so bizarre would have the opposite effect. Honestly, the few minutes of research I just did make me want to go full rabbit hole on the spade family and Disney&#39;s &quot;The Rescuers&quot;; is it worth it though? I doubt it.</p>

<p>Gonna try to find the &quot;Where is Kate&quot; ad.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Fair enough, I&#39;m just interested in whether or not you can make this substance from a certain type of nightshade though, Vice is a bad source for anything if you ask me, that&#39;s why I didn&#39;t bother with google. Plus I seem to remember that they tracked this stuff down, but I could be wrong, either way I figured there&#39;d be better sources than Vice and I found none to debunk it when I googled &quot;scopolamine devil&#39;s breath debunked&quot; - a few to question it, but nothing more</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, I question Vice too. That doc they did on Japanese Maid Cafes was just flat out wrong 80% of the time. I was just sticking up for OP&#39;s reference to Vice. We can argue validity of sources til we&#39;re blue in the face...but he did in fact offer a source.</p>

<p>Serious question....have you ever thought about going to seek out this powder yourself? A lot of people on these forums like to bark about truth but few go out in the world and find things out for themselves. I&#39;m not saying I&#39;m Indiana Jones either, but I have put myself out in the world to find things out. Imagine if half the people in this sub did self-investigating reporting we&#39;d all be a lot more informed.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>He did offer a source but I watched that docu and I do not recall what he claims. That&#39;s why I asked, otherwise I might just have watched it.</p>

<p>No way, would I go to Bogota and chase after some zombie powder... That wouldn&#39;t be smart. <em>If</em> it existed and people wanted to keep it a secret and some gringo was running around asking about it, what do you think would happen? I&#39;m not that crazy. If I hear about hitmen on the deep web, I&#39;m not going to go search for them either. Ever. Because all I could find if I didn&#39;t fully commit would be indications and &#39;clues&#39;. Nope. Would you go look for it?</p>

<p>But I put a few sources up and can&#39;t find any word on it being debunked by googling and have only heard the debunking claim from OP and I <em>saw</em> the docu he refers to (unless they made more than one of course) hence my scepticism. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Too much for a reddit post but in a nutshell, I&#39;ve been to places like Angkor Wat in Cambodia....the place fascinated me for 20 years so I decided to go. It was a mazing to me that there was just this massive stone city that&#39;s bigger than the Great Pyriamid at Giza&#39;s foot print, and has been swallowed by the jungle on multiple occasions. The engineering is unbelivable. Cambodia today couldn&#39;t reproduce it. It&#39;s hard to explain, but going to place like that really puts it in perspective what ancient people were capable of.</p>

<p>As far as secret bases. Years ago, my friend and I went hiking just off a highway near the border of Colorado, south of Laramie. We found a bunch of rock formations that could be seen from the road but were &#39;off limits&#39; to pedestrians. Well, we made them &#39;on limits&#39; to us and found out they were made of sandblasted drywall and actually had ventilation ducts and wiring going into the ground behind them. Also, not far from there was a giant silver dome in the middle of the desert. No way we went near that though.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>See this sounds interesting... You don&#39;t have a blog, youtube account or something like that, do you? Or maybe even published works? I have read a bit about these old building techniques and so on and I am fascinated by these places, so those I could see myself visiting, I just don&#39;t know if there&#39;s much to be gained in terms of actual knowledge from me going there. I mean it has kind of been done by people like you, so unless I am looking for certain bits of information, it would be for fun tbh. I could see myself going to especially Egypt, both because it is the most interesting one to me and because I live in Denmark, so it is closest and the one I am most aware of, I guess.</p>

Same with Kate Spade.</p>

<p>And the mere fact hanging isn&#39;t the most popular method of suicide is in itself suspect (especially in women) so.........to say he hung himself and each article ends with a hot-line number is insane journalism!!!</p>

<p>There&#39;s a LOT of suspicion around these &#39;hangings&#39; lately (Kate Spade, Chester Bennington, Chris Cornel etc).....because interesting enough they all had some indirect involvement with the Clinton&#39;s (and we all know about the HUGE wake of dead bodies behind them by now).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>On the contrary I don’t see any compelling reasons why this isn’t a suicide and logically it makes sense that it is. Just because some things are a conspiracy doesn’t mean everything is. It’s sad and troubling that he’s dead and that he felt the need to kill himself but people do commit suicide not all suicides are covered up murders. As to why he hung himself instead of OD or shooting; it seems like this was probably a fairly unplanned spur of the moment thing given the fact that he killed himself while part way through filming an episode. Being in France means that it would be hard to get a gun and the guy has been clean from heroin for decades (as far as we know). Trying to score heroin on the street in Strasbourg when you’re as famous as Bourdain is would be hard to do. At the very least it’s likely his crew would find out/notice bringing up a lot of questions and conversations he probably didn’t want to have.  Hanging yourself is simple and effective. You don’t need a lot of supplies to do it just some rope or a belt and 30 min alone. I also, don’t see any compelling motive to have him murdered. This does absolutely nothing to help Weinstein escape prosecution. Bourdain wasn’t a witness just an outspoken famous person with a twitter account who happened to be dating an accuser. Besides I don’t think there’s any evidence Weinstein has stooped to murder. The intimidation and harassment from him is on a lower level. Bourdain is also not important or influential enough of a voice to be a major threat and there’s plenty of stuff out there about the Armenian genocide. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I absolutely agree with everyone. As much as everyone here, I have been following Tony for over 10 years. And with his personality and rawness...quite closely like the rest of you. My wife and I were really sad this morning and choked up some tears....but....we then started to think...WTF. Makes no sense. If you read all of his press releases and interviews and watch everything...he was open about how grateful he was for his career, how much he loves his daughter, meeting people and being inspired. He also stated a few days ago that this was the happiest he has ever been----and not in some &quot;mania&quot; type of way, but just excited to be alive!  </p>

<p>I hope we all (and maybe Anonymous) can shed some light on the truth behind this shit. Because it&#39;s a fucking boldface lie and the mass media has it wrong. He was murdered. Murder means an investigation. Suicide means something &quot;internal&quot; ---thus no intense investigation. Everyone keep a close eye out.</p>

<p>Most of the people saying weinstein or kissinger or moussad murdered him because of tweets are virgin incels who have never been in love and have no idea how devastating it can be to have your heart broken by someone you truly care about, especially a much younger woman. Then he sees her with a man 30 years younger than him, shes looking deeply into his eyes, and they are now holding hands walking thrugh the same city where Anthony fell in love with her. He sees this in the tabloids and acts on depressive impulse. Women can do some really underhanded devious shit and really really fuck your head over, and I dont think a lot of the basement dwellers on this sub have a very good concept of what thats like.</p>

The Kate Spade one initially I did (that is until looking more into it and especially the weird mouse mask with a red scarf worn by the husband). I think red also has Masonic ties but not 100% sure. Bordain’s suicide is simply fishy as Hell. I predict Alex Jones will be the 3rd. If not, then soon. He’s already spoken out about Sandy Hoax and Bordain’s death as a murder. He won’t be around long.</p>

This is modus operandi for the events surrounding several of the terror attacks in Paris.
They can operate with police complicity given they most officers will get a senior person warning them before they get suicided too.</p>

<p>Macron worked directly for the Rothschild&#39;s and wants to pass even stricter counter terrorism laws.
And the continuing efforts in the middle east, with covert wars in Syria and the like.
Good reasons for bumping him off if he had more than he was meant to know.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sorry guys, I&#39;m into uncovering the truth and not accepting the official story just as much as the next free thinker, but this one really does have all the hallmarks of a legit suicide unfortunately. Struggle with past heroin and cocaine addiction, current heavy drinker, sensitive deep thinker deeply troubled by suffering of others in the world and very conscious of global suffering through his travels, constantly travelling trying to run away from himself and fill a hole he never could fill. </p>

<p>And the icing on the cake for anthony was falling in love with a hollywood chick 20 years younger than him. She posted a cryptic message dissing him on twitter 3 hours before he was found dead, which she then deleted. She was photographed by paparazi in Rome holding hands and hugging a guy 30 years younger than Anthony the day before, a city anthony had experienced with her a few wees earlier. The paparazzi who took these photos realizes this is likely what led to bourdains suicide so he has since stopped selling these pics, and you know how greedy and uncaring paparazi usually are. </p>

<p>He went to bat for her and supported her in her allegations, and then it looks like she turned around and fucked him over. He was likely devastated by this. </p>

<p>Some of you may not know how love can fuck you over, but it really can. He thought he had the love of his life and then he realized he may be alone again. His best friend who found him dead has already said he was very gloomy for 4 days and thats why. When women fuck you over it can make you do some dumb shit. One of my dad&#39;s friends hung himself after a girl 25 years younger left him. Love can lead you to your highest highs and your lowest lows.</p>

<p>And as far as Weinstein killing him over a tweet, if Weinstein had the desire or the ability to kill everyone who tweeted badly about him, we would have a body count in the thousands. </p>

<p>This is a clear case of a scorned lover being hurt by a much younger girl and making a stupid rash decision at a very low moment. It happens. And the tabloids prove it. While mainstream more respected news outlets will not speculate and wont air dirty laundry while people are mourning, the tabloids wont hesitate and they delivered the news when it was fresh instead of waiting.</p>

<p>No conspiracy here. Just a reckless younger chick and an obsessed older man who felt she was everything and he had lost her, after he failed at marriage twice befor</p>

<p>In conspiracies and crime they say follow the money, but if you want to know why a man does what he does, follow the women. Looks like an older man took his life after being scorned by the younger woman he loved. He wasnt the first and certainly wont be the last. RIP.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thank you. I&#39;m so glad I&#39;m not the only one. I immediately assumed murder because it seemed to be solved so fast. Plus his wife seems so suspisious now that I&#39;m looking into it more. Heard she was seen holding hands walking with another man just days ago and she posted a pic on instagram a few hours before Bourdain&#39;s death was reported of her shirt that said &quot;fuck everyone&quot; with the caption &quot;you know who you are&quot;. Then she took it down soon after... Of course they said there was no third party involved immediately too. How could they know that so fast? Pretty sure that would entail an in depth investigstion, but it literally seemed like they walked in, scanned the room lazily and were like &quot;yep, don&#39;t see shit&quot; and that was it. As soon as I heard it was a hanging it made me think he was targeted. (Makes me think back to the Heath Ledger / The Imaginarium of Dr. Parnassus conspiracy with the hanged man and how Ledger was literally hanged during the making of a movie about the fucking illuminati.)  Plus if you&#39;ve been depressed your whole life and know you want to die from heroin there&#39;s no way you&#39;d hang yourself! Its usually not instant if you don&#39;t drop from high enough so why would he put himself through a slow painful death? There&#39;s no way. If he has actually thought about it so much throughout his life then he would&#39;ve done it his way. No questions asked. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Im shocked and thorned about this. 
He was so outsppken, he was continuously tweeting and saying stuff about big names so of course it is a possibility that he was murdered and staged as a suicide. He was speaking loud uncomfortable truths of the powerful and people have been killed for that before, they could easily do it without trace there are groups around the world dedicated to do that.
On the other hand he did had a dark side and all his fans that followed him we know, he was a super heavy drinker too as we could see on his shows, sometimes heavily hangover. Alcohol is a big nervous system depressor. He got divorced of Ottavia, he wasn&#39;t seeing his daughter as much as he wanted,  then he hooked up with this very shady and honestly fucked up lady, the Weinstein episode with her ex boyfriend (Vincent Gallo) is just disturbing, then the pictures, then the t shirt pictures that after the suicide was announced she erased... Sometimes the simplest explanation is the real one. I think maybe they broke up, they fought, she sent that message to him, he supported her and seemed very much inlove, so in that sadness maybe he was drinking and drinking and he decided to kill himself.</p>

<p>Method - he was given, by injection, a short-acting, potent paralyzing drug to asphyxiate him. Then, when he&#39;s unconscious, hang him up to make it look like suicide.
Mossad are experts in this technique.</p>

<p>11lbs of pressure on a properly tied noose will knock you out in less than 15 seconds.  It&#39;s like being put in a sleeper hold.  Mildly uncomfortable and then you black out.  It takes much longer for you to actually die, but you aren&#39;t awake for any of that.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I disagree. With experience in both drugs and ju-jitsu, being largely clean of drugs and in a foreign city, it doesn&#39;t seem far fetched to think he chose to hang himself. ODing is likely to result in permanently damage but not necessarily death. Getting enough drugs to kill himself painlessly in a foreign city could also be problematic. Ju Jitsu teaches a person exactly how to choke somebody out, how quickly it works and how painless it can be, it&#39;s a near sure thing for someone like him. When he has said in the past he&#39;d like to go out with a massive drug overdose I think there could have been a ring of thruth to all that, but age and experience probably taught him how problematic that could be. Not to mention, if he was serious about wanting to die he may have been in no mood for one last party. All that being said, if there is foul play at hand here, I&#39;d guess sure whoever did the job has all the psychological profiles surrounding this kind of shit down pat. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You can try out out yourself... not like kill yourself, You know, that  &quot;pass out game&quot;</p>

<p>I tried it once as a teen. I did it to many people as well. For Some reason we thought to was funny or some shit. But It really is crazy fast. </p>

<p>What we did was bend over breathing rapidly for like 30secs, come up holding your last breath. Then, get your buddy to hold pressure (using the palms) over the jugular veins on both sides of the neck till you get weak and start snoring. Hopefully they catch you because Before you know it you&#39;ll be laying on the ground confused as fuck. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>He had said previously in an interview that he would never kill himself because he has an 11yr old daughter.  And I find no reason to disagree with a man saying that.  Thats real shit to me.     Take that into account before you shrug everything off.  Tell me it isnt the least bit suspicious.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Fair enough, I&#39;m just interested in whether or not you can make this substance from a certain type of nightshade though, Vice is a bad source for anything if you ask me, that&#39;s why I didn&#39;t bother with google. Plus I seem to remember that they tracked this stuff down, but I could be wrong, either way I figured there&#39;d be better sources than Vice and I found none to debunk it when I googled &quot;scopolamine devil&#39;s breath debunked&quot; - a few to question it, but nothing more</p>

    <div class="md"><p>He did offer a source but I watched that docu and I do not recall what he claims. That&#39;s why I asked, otherwise I might just have watched it.</p>

<p>No way, would I go to Bogota and chase after some zombie powder... That wouldn&#39;t be smart. <em>If</em> it existed and people wanted to keep it a secret and some gringo was running around asking about it, what do you think would happen? I&#39;m not that crazy. If I hear about hitmen on the deep web, I&#39;m not going to go search for them either. Ever. Because all I could find if I didn&#39;t fully commit would be indications and &#39;clues&#39;. Nope. Would you go look for it?</p>

<p>But I put a few sources up and can&#39;t find any word on it being debunked by googling and have only heard the debunking claim from OP and I <em>saw</em> the docu he refers to (unless they made more than one of course) hence my scepticism. </p>
