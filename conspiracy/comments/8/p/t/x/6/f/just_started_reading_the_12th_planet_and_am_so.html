        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Hi all, first post here. I recently picked up a copy of Zecharia Sitchin&#39;s &quot;12th Planet,&quot; which I initially expected to be a bunch of hogwash. But after reading the first forty pages or so I must admit that I&#39;m pretty impressed by the level of writing. I do not at all get the feeling that Sitchin is some airhead new ager that resorts to jibberish to get his point across. I honestly find a lot of the arguments I&#39;ve read in there so far as fairly convincing and I am keeping an open mind. I thought the point he made about how strange the idea is that it took 500,000+ years of evolution for the first civilization to evolve was quite intriguing. It does seem hard to believe that Sumer arose seemingly out of the blue 6000 years ago without any kind of intervention. The level of technological advancement possessed by that culture is hard to believe. Accompany that with some of the recent findings of artifacts that appear to be much older leads me to believe that there is some kind of &quot;hidden history&quot; so to speak. </p>

<p>What are your thoughts on this? Curious to hear different opinions. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>There are things that pre-date our understanding of human history. I don&#39;t necessarily think it&#39;s a cover up. I think our current understanding is based on a small time frame in grand scope of things. It&#39;s not outlandish to think that knowledge has been lost along the way. I don&#39;t think it was anything crazy like space travel or anything but with the world being a whole lot smaller back then it wouldn&#39;t take a large disaster to wipe out a large portion of what we did have.

    <div class="md"><p>Just take a look at our chromosomes. We have 24, however two of our then have what appears to be a addition to the end. It appears that there was some cutting and splicing going on. Also the missing link. Hmmm genetic manipulation maybe. Our chromosomes are like none other on the planet. I asked my neighbor, who is a retired geneticist after 32 years at a highly known and respected university near where we live. How does our current chromosome configuration compare to the rest of the species on earth. It does he said. I then asked about the apparent cut and splice on two of our chromosomes and the difference between what we were and are now since apes have 26 chromosomes. He laughed and said oh you noticed that. Yea that&#39;s a subject not really discussed in our community.  I said why. His answer. Because it does not occur naturally in nature. Species dont lose chromosomes they add them as they evolve w new information and traits building on top of the current structure. The only way that this can present this way is through genetic manipulation as these same type of configurations exist in species have modified in scientific test. So it doesnt occur naturally and the only way it can present is in the event of genetic splicing and manipulation. His answer. Yes. </p>

<p>Read the book of Enoch if you wanna see evidence of the Annunaki in scripture. &quot;In those days there were giants&quot;. It speaks of the watchers and nephalim.  Those are the Annunaki. Clay tablets in Sumaria that are thousands of years old speak of the genetic manipulation of humans by this same race.  Educate yourself then state there is no evidence. Otherwise shut up and troll somewhere else.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Just read the rest, a lot of it is malarchy.
There&#39;s plenty of species that evolve and do not increase their amount of chromosomes. 
Darwin&#39;s finches come to mind. 
The genetic variation of human genetics has systematically changed completely naturally.  Telomeres exist on many (all?) Chromosomes,  those that are elongated tend to last longer. Also found all over the animal kingdom.  </p>

<p>Book of Enoch is super interesting but you would be hard pressed to state it talks about genetic splicing. </p>

<p>I&#39;ve researched, I&#39;ve read, and I won&#39;t tell people &quot;shut up.&quot;  But you should look at all sides of  evidences before drawing a conclusion. Not just fringe conjecture.</p>

<p>Also with a quick Google,  apes have 24 chromosomes.<br/>

    <div class="md"><p>Ok so never said book of enoch talks of splicing so if used your logic the rest of your post would be malarkey. The sumerian clay tables speak of splicing which happen to be thousands of years older than any of the books in the bible. Mentions of a race that matches the Annunaki as well as another race know as the Nordics or Pleadians are mentioned in detail in several Indian texts to the point of naming the pilot of a flying craft. Almost every single ancient text from all over the world mentions star people at some point. There are gold mines in Africa that have been carbon dated to 200k years ago. A quick google search will give some insight. I also never said anything about increasing chromosomes. I said decreasing. The configuration and nature of our telomeres is vastly different than other species. It  includes a rna that doesnt present in apes. Nor any other species. So where is this missing link and how did our species evolve more in a span of less than 300k years then in the 3million before that and very little to none in the 300k since then. Evolutionary steps are a constant and are typically based on environmental or geographical conditions. But yet even as humans have spread the globe genetically we have had little change. Look at octopi. Newest research contends that a study on their rna revealed that there is a high probability they did not originate from earth. The other poster was correct in the statement of me stating a incorrect number of chromosomes. I apologize. However there is much more evidence every day that points to a history of us and this planet that is vastly different than what is taught. How many times in the last 500 years has science disproved the current narrative. The sun rotated around the earth, the earth was flat and you would fall off the edge if you sailed to far and so on. Gobeki Tempe is a perfect example of structures that were built out of anthracite granite that rates 8 out of 10 on the hardness scale w diamond being a 10. They were cut assembled and positioned w a precision that cannot be matched even to this day. The estimated date it was constructed. 13000 years ago. So sorry i made a few numerical errors. However you made errors of your own in reference to what I said. I will leave all of you with this. What you believe and what is the truth can sometimes be very different things. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>So the Sumerian clay tablets that talk about splicing.... that happened according to you 300k years ago (you said there&#39;s been very little change in our genetics since then) those tablets are 300k years old?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Jesus bro. No. Do the research. Those tablet are believed to be at least 5 to 7 thousand and some claim up 12 thousand years old or just after the last ice age. They recount a history given to them by the Annunaki among other things of our history. The word Annunaki is ancient sumer is translated as &quot;Those who from the stars came&quot;. There is also a tablet known as the &quot;kings list&quot; that recounts the kings in the times before them dating back over 50k years using the long calendar or the one based on our current astrological signs. We are currently in the age of aquarius which happened recently and we were in sagittarius before that. The 300k since our current species yes. The only changes that had happened were due breeding w other less evolved species like Neanderthals. In terms of a evolutionary jump there is nothing that compares to the one we made at that point. Again where is the missing link between those 2 species. Where is the evidence. There is none. Could there be even a slight possibility that another off planet race came here needed semi articulate and intelligent workers used their technology to modify the current species into something they could use. Could that be the explanation for things such as sasquatch, and other anomalous creatures that sporadically appear. Due to variants that were produced in the early stages that were considered failures. It would explain the reason of why the population of these specimens are extremely low as few of them were even made in the beginning. Could it also explain why we have more genetic mutations than any other species. Things that present in humans that dont in apes, or any other species. What about this race of giants. Bones have been found all.over the world of the human like 8 to 10 foot tall creatures.  Hell there is newspaper articles w pictures from the early 1900s of them. Which consequently  were confiscated by the Smithsonian and &quot;lost&quot; there was even a federal case that proved they had them and they were destroyed bc they didnt fit the narrative of director at the time who was a Christian. I put a link to the article below. The federal judge ruled the Smithsonian must release classified documents relating to that destruction.  There has also recently been DNA tests done on elongated skulls discovered in south America that had &quot;human like&quot; DNA however was not human. The evidence is out there and very easy to find if you look. That evidence is pointing more and more to the theory that the history you think you know is not what it seems. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Do black people have those extra splicey bits? Swear to God I&#39;m not trying to be &quot;racist&quot;. I just read a paper called Archaic Human Ancestry in the Far East by Skoglund and Jakobson (both of whom I respect for their rigor) that shows that they&#39;re &quot;pure&quot; humans in the sense that they are the only race who did not venture out from mother Africa and therefore did not have the chance to interbreed with Denisovans and Neanderthals (which explains quite a lot, though is rarely discussed due to our fetishising &quot;equality&quot;), so I&#39;m curious. </p>
