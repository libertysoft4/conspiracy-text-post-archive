        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Assuming that the government/dark shadowy people are always trying to get you to buy into their lies, we have to consider that Wikileaks is the new mechanism for this.  While for the past century, the media may have been their tool of choice, it&#39;s not surprising that with the rise of the Internet people have been growing increasingly distrustful of MSM.  </p>

<p>The question then becomes - how do we get them to buy our bullshit?  What better way to disguise bullshit than to make it appear that it&#39;s leaked information?  For added credibility, throw in a few odd truths in there, and make it look like the public government (those not involved in the lies) is out to catch the guy responsible.  After all, we are increasingly becoming a nation who&#39;s out to seek the truth from an underdog who appears to be working in our best interests, and fighting for the ultimate value: truth.  </p>

<p>I can&#39;t speak for the reddit crowd, (still new here), but otherwise, everywhere I look, I don&#39;t see anyone questioning the validity of what&#39;s coming out from Wikileaks.  It&#39;s being bought at face value as being absolute truth.  Best of all, due to the nature of how Wikileaks is structured (ie., 250,000 documents received last November and being trickled out over a long time), this is something that they could ride for a LOOOOOOONG time, and it&#39;s always ready to go at the drop of a hat if you need to distract.  Something embarrasing happen to Dick Cheney?  &#39;Leak&#39; a story about whatever the fuck you want and draw attention away from Dick.  Your &#39;leaked&#39; story appears on pages 1, 2, 3, 38, and 39 of every newspaper, while Dick&#39;s story appears on page 93, <em>if at all</em>.</p>

<p>Need more oil?  &#39;Leak&#39; some documents about X oil country being a pube hair away from having nuclear weapons.</p>

<p>Pakistan even tried to do this, but it was quickly found out that it was all a sham because they only put in a half-assed effort, but I don&#39;t think it&#39;s so far fetched that our own Wikileaks could be entirely manufactured as a tool for feeding us new lies.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It is certainly a real possibility. A couple things always struck me as odd, already mentioned, which are how the leaks are always treated as infallable truth, which is never seen elsewhere, and the seeming invincibility of Wikileaks to being shut down. When anything is desired by the owners to be discredited, it is immediately scorned, such as the docs of GW&#39;s desertion, which while forged, contained truthful elements totally lost in the attacks on Rather.</p>

<p>The right is especially geared towards the discreditation of anything they find inconvenient. Many still doubt Obama&#39;s citizenship. Howls of derision would be heaped on anything they were told to discredit, yet that never happens with anything released by WL. I also find it incredulous that our vaunted Homeland Security, CyberWar division headed by modern day Eliot Ness, could not shut down any internet based operation in the world if it so desired, or at least send in special ops to take out the real world players. Something fishy in Sweden.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The thought that it could be an intentional leak did occur to me, for the reason you stated, it&#39;s been mostly beneficial or benign to US interests.</p>

<p>It&#39;s the perfect cover, it&#39;s loved and trusted by the tinfoil hats, the government makes a show of discrediting it, it won&#39;t be verified by secondary sources.</p>

<p>My guess is, we&#39;ll never know the truth, it&#39;s 100% plausible to me that the apparent nature of the leaks is what actually happened. None of it&#39;s uncharacteristic of a real leak, which is what would make it an elegant misinformation campaign. </p>

    <div class="md"><p><strong>No, Its not.</strong> Wikileaks has been a nightmare to the &quot;government/dark shadowy people&quot;. Wikileaks should be everything an <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> addict could ever dream of. Exposing <em>authentic</em> leaked documents from governments all over the world. Its absolutely amazing to me that anyone could possibly turn this back around and say its just &quot;the man&quot; trying to feed us more lies. Its almost like nothing would ever be enough to satisfy your suspicion of <em>the man</em> who is trying to deceive you. How could you possibly think that all these VERIFIED, AUTHENTIC, leaked documents which have been a political <strong>disaster</strong> to those who have abused their powers is faked?, then go back to watching some bullshit Illuminati youtube video made by some 13 year old kid? THIS IS WHAT YOU HAVE BEEN WAITING FOR!!!!!!!!! THIS IS THE REAL THING!!!!!!!! If you cant accept this as anti-government/Illuminati/shadowy people, then you will never be satisfied with anything.

<p>Glad you said that, but below Ill tell you and everyone else reading this why I think it is highly unlikely wikileaks is a government planned fraud.</p>

<p>If you and your buds told me you had classified leaked documents, your right, I probably wouldn&#39;t believe you. Unless you showed me something like <a href="http://www.collateralmurder.com/">This</a> video which is obviously not fake or <a href="http://213.251.145.96/iraq/diarydig/">This</a> huge war logs database. Both of which unveil the truth about whats happening during the war, and I cant see the point in government purposely showing us how atrocious the war they are engaging us in is has become. </p>

<p>Look, I&#39;m new to <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>, Im not a conspiracy theorist, but I come here because I like the way people like <em>you</em> question the status quo, don&#39;t take everything at face value, and are aware that <em>there are</em> some people trying to deceive the general public to further their own goals. <em>BUT</em> I think you have over stepped your bounds this time. It doesn&#39;t make sense that they would purposely release information detrimental to their own cause in some sort or reverse reverse psychological game to deceive the general public. I know <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> doesn&#39;t trust major news networks like FOX, who are openly proposing to assassinate Julian Assange. So who would you rather believe when it comes to information about the government, FOX? who is an obvious hand puppet of the Military Industrial Complex, or The people who are exposing the wrongdoings of said government, wikileaks? I know who I would trust. Just think of <em>how many</em> people would have to be in on it for that to work. The President, His Cabinet, State Department, Military personnel, wikileaks, Mainstream media. The conspiracy itself would leak. </p>

<p>No one is doubting that Assange himself doesn&#39;t has political leanings, Its no secret that he doesn&#39;t think highly of American Foreign policy and especially the political right, but that doesn&#39;t mean the content is false or that the &quot;powers that be&quot; are in on it.</p>

<p>Wikileaks is not a lie, Its the god of juicy disclosures every person who really seeks truth has been waiting for their entire life. <em>Don&#39;t let it pass you by because your too busy looking for something thats not there</em></p>
