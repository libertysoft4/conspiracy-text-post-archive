    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, Newspeak seems to have infested the moving picture boxes, but despite whatever speculations I have about what is and what is not, the thought on my mind is that maybe there is something much more subtle going on. I came across an article named &quot;The Tyranny of Language&quot; and it made me pause. What impact does language have on how a person views reality (whatever that means), could the true act of dominance be the way we are all taught to read and write?</p>

<p>Sounds dangerously close to becoming another Arizona shooter... I kid, I kid, just joking...</p>

<p>On a serious note, language is extremely important, and anyone that thinks otherwise is a fool imho.  Without language we wouldn&#39;t be able to effectively communicate with each other; we would be no harder to control than a pack of wild animals.  Instead of getting rid of language completely, remove certain words to get the same result, a group of people that aren&#39;t able to effectively communicate.</p>

<p>The worst of it all, imho, is when the words exist but people don&#39;t understand the definition.  After 12 years in school most people still don&#39;t have any idea what the definition of identity is, and it&#39;s such an important word!  Dictionaries are available everywhere and they&#39;re dirt cheap, so who&#39;s really be blame?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Again thanks for the response, but I am still at a loss, you make a value judgment in your 1 and 2nd sentence based on personal opinion. This just reinforces my early point, not to say you are an agent, but come on, the main point I was trying to make is every time a poster comes in with an observation the first respones always tend to be the same. The poster is accused of being wrong and on and on he has to go trying to defend his observation. No discussion of what possibly could be, just meaningless defense?  The reason this comes to be in my opinion is modern education, the imparting of binary logic to the masses. Yes or No are the critical thinking skills bestowed to the majority.  Some authority will grade the black or white. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I believe it is our nature to be lazy. As we have seen recently from the Nazis if you provide jobs with decent wages, food, and keep order the people in general will be pacified to overlook many misgivings even while the infrastructure for tyranny is being established. As long as cheap goods from third world slave labor flows in, our farming industry is subsidized, and the entertainment industry retains it&#39;s power true change is hard to obtain. The tactics used today are ancient and only implementation has changed. The people are indoctrinated in black and white without a grey area from the barbarians of old to the terrorists of today, from the amphitheater to comic books. You must question how 20% of the world population consume 80% of the worlds resources unless the other 80% have been enslaved through puppet governments, economic warfare, military campaigns, intimidation, corruption, and double speak. Meanwhile the living generations of America have been indoctrinated that the imperialist agenda we maintain is required. I believe that Americans are willing to accept this unequal balance because greed has sunken it&#39;s teeth into every aspect of our society. Clearly when comparing American culture to that of other first world countries we see the propaganda machine injecting greed and emotions to send people down corner after corner while only those above see the maze we are in. The same techniques are used in every controlling government but when the people are fat and happy the fear of being chastised by your peers is more effective than the threat of violence. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>i agree with a lot of what you say...and so i reflect to you the question of whether your belief that &quot;it&#39;s our nature to be lazy&quot; is a byproduct of the conditioning we are all subjected to.  for, if perspective, thoughts, feelings and actions all stem from our beliefs, then what better way is there to indoctrinate people than to control/influence/design their beliefs?  personally, i believe humans, in their freest form, are brilliant and creative and compassionate...when living without the imposed fear that we are separate and there isn&#39;t enough to go around, we default to love, and carry an inherent understanding that all life is deeply connected.  would it not be easier to control the masses were they to actually believe they are lazy? would it not empower the masses were they to actually believe they are altruistic beings who have a birthright of freedom and creativity?  just a thought...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, obesity in the U.S. is a prime example. While diet is a key factor, most weight problems could be significantly reduced with exercise. Due to the lower population density of the U.S. than say Europe, we are much more reliant on vehicles for transportation and I believe both of us could agree that someone who walks or bikes to their daily activities is less likely to be overweight. Exercising is free, is commonly known to improve health and BMI, and is extremely important in a healthy lifestyle. We find however with the overwhelming healthcare costs related to obesity that even with the knowledge of the power of exercise that we would rather have all aspects of health decline than run for 30 minutes a day. You could argue that our society imposes influences and outside pressures that create a susceptibility to obesity but I would rather argue that most indoctrinations of today are not reversing progression but rather maintaining the same primitive means of order that have been used since the earliest documented civilizations. Decreasing the roles of egos, emotions, and impulses in decision making requires self control. While you could compare Germany&#39;s abilities to say..........put plastic bottles in a blue bin or find alternative means of decreasing foreign energy dependence, I find it only comes from necessity due to competition from neighboring countries. Sadly there will always be those with selfish or sinister intentions that will manipulate the weaknesses of humanity and while that prevention is nonexistent today I do believe that we have the tools required to educate and instill the self discipline to change not on necessity but for the benefit of society. I do not know how you could claim the feasibility of an idealistic society when the people refuse to abandon the laziness and ignorance that has been perpetuated from the beginning of civilization without being incremented over the time spent in a backwards society instead of believing that there is some secret key to unlocking all negative aspects of society without there being many dead generations in between the implementation of such ideas. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;I do not know how you could claim the feasibility of an idealistic society when the people refuse to abandon the laziness and ignorance that has been perpetuated from the beginning of civilization...&quot;</p>

<p>This statement ties into my point that what you believe is true for you, that your beliefs become the filter through which you view the world.  For example, I live in Canada, where obesity is far less epidemic than in America, and I am seeing more people more frequently abandon &quot;laziness and ignorance&quot; for self-education and self-care, in regards to diet and other aspects of being a human.  So, through my own personal experience I believe that people do and can and want to change...yes! it&#39;s idealistic, but I would much rather be a proponent of what is possible and an advocate for change, than someone who only focuses on the condition that caused the desire for change to begin with...in what other way can we evolve?  given that we are all &quot;hypnotized&quot; by our conditioning AND that we can condition ourselves to believe anything, why not condition yourself with beliefs that create/perpetuate a reality that is one you would like to see rather than one you would not?  to me, this is the greatest gift we have as humans....we are so free to think anything, that we can think thoughts that bind us.  anyway, thanks for exchanging these ideas...:) </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Laziness is a nurture issue, not a nature one. Do not underestimate the power of conditioning to trick you into thinking that some qualities are just a natural part of being human. By analyzing humans within the present paradigm, it is very difficult to determine that something is a product of &#39;nature&#39; as opposed to &#39;nurture&#39;. The first part of Zeitgeist Moving Forward does touch upon this point. VEry well written post though, it summarizes in a nutshell the plight of society.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Do you think I was accusing you of being wrong?  That&#39;s not what I was trying to do at all.  I already said it once, but I&#39;ll say it again, I agree with basically everything you&#39;ve said.  The part about the arizona shooter was just a joke, probably a bad one at that...</p>

<p>The whole point I&#39;ve been trying to make here is that we are not a name, we use a name but we&#39;re not the name itself.  Bill collectors and/or courts send letters addressed to the name, but people think the letters are addressed to them because they think they&#39;re the name.  This is why I&#39;ve brought up the definition of identity multiple times; the root word in identity is the same root word in identical.  Identifying as something is basically making a claim that you&#39;re identical to what you&#39;re identifying as.  Are you identical to a name?  Are we required to identify as a name?  Is there any lawful authority allowing someone else to identify us as a name?</p>

First they dont publish or run any story without approval from the CEO&#39;s who get there memos and how to run there business&#39; from the government, lets not forget between 01 and 04, The White House and CIA would release info to certain news agencies through a &quot;secure line&quot; and we all know what happened between 01-04. Also, these news companies CNN, FOX, NBC, ABC, whatever major news conglomerate, actually will hire people to &quot;troll&quot; forums to get there public agenda rolling, and move support to one side or the other depending on the situation.

    <div class="md"><p>It is part of the general pattern of misguided policy that our country is now geared to an arms economy which was bred in an artificially induced psychosis of war hysteria and nurtured upon an incessant propaganda of fear.
~ General Douglas MacArthur</p>

<p>The enormous gap between what US leaders do in the world and what Americans think their leaders are doing is one of the great propaganda accomplishments of the dominant political mythology. ~ Michael Parenti</p>

<p>The propaganda system allows the U.S. leadership to commit crimes without limit and with no suggestion of misbehavior or criminality; in fact, major war criminals like Henry Kissinger appear regularly on TV to comment on the crimes of the derivative butchers. ~ Edward Herman</p>

<p>I wasn&#39;t trying to prove that the idea you&#39;re sharing is false, in fact I agree with it.  People that falsely believe they&#39;re free are hopelessly enslaved because in order to free oneself from slavery they must first realize that they&#39;re enslaved.</p>

<p>The point I was trying to make is that we might be the ones &quot;enslaving&quot; ourselves due to our willingness to be deceived.  Qui vult decipi, decipiatur. (Set him who wishes to be deceived, be deceived.)  Metaphor: It&#39;s easy to blame the manufactures of alcohol for an alcoholic&#39;s problems, but isn&#39;t the alcoholic himself at least partially responsible?</p>

<p>Are bills and/or court summons addressed to the name we&#39;re using or are they addressed to the human being using the name?  Are we required to identify as a name?  If someone thinks we are required to identify as a name, which law makes it so?</p>

<p>Do you see what I&#39;m trying to get at here?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Look at some of the responses I have gotten here or on most peoples threads around the internet.  Go look at some of the r/politics threads and just observe what is being said.  I recall reading in China they have censors that check everything being written on message boards (somebody let me know if I am wrong), what makes you think they are not doing it here in much more subtle way? I find it hard to believe all the money they spend is directed outside this country. The more immediate danger to the system is a random mass uprising locally. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You will need to be more pragmatic in the way you approach this accusation. Reddit is owned by Conde Naste. It was built by two guys and it runs on a bunch of servers. From what I hear although Conde Naste could pull the plug at any time they leave reddit to do it&#39;s own thing. For what you are proposing to be true it is unfeasible for a lot of the small websites. The effect of forcing a message board website to allow you to connect with root access to change wall posts would have undoubtledly be known about, because these are small independent sites. Therein lies the disruptive power of the internet. The Mass media, on the other hand, is controlled from the top- we all know that.</p>

Direct oppression is obvious, a massive amount of people sitting in front of keyboards trolling large message boards and newspaper comments, no way that could happen.

    <div class="md"><p>I interpreted this as meaning the powers that be don&#39;t have to do much by way of actually censoring truth websites or ideas. Their propaganda and conditioning for the masses has been so good that the people themselves keep each other in the group mentality that the propaganda is reality through ridicule and incredulity and &#39;well, everyone knows this or that&#39;. The minds of the masses prevent many ideas and truths from getting in so the government doesn&#39;t necessarily have to put up an actual firewall like in China. The firewall is already in the people themselves.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>IMHO people should focus less energy on strategies that try to wake other people up, but what exactly to do instead is hard to say.  There is no silver bullet.  The system we are under is setup very well, I actually admire it sometimes for how good it works. But if I had the power to do one thing it would be to get rid of drivers licenses.  They are one of the most powerful tools the system has when you start thinking about it.   </p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;they spend all this money on intelligence, where do you think it goes?&quot;</p>

<p>Fas ass consultants, lobbyists, big business, greedy people.  Taking away liberties, starting wars, etc... these are just means to an end - the ultimate goal is pretty simple, and not very glamorous: &quot;How can I make more money?&quot;</p>

<p>Example 1: How do I make money for me and my best buds who own weapons manufacturing companies?  We&#39;ll start a war!  Result: Iraq war.</p>

<p>Example 2: Owner of X-Ray machine - how can I make more money selling these?  I know, I&#39;ll get some guy to get on a plane with a shitty underwear bomb.  Result: Thousands of sales of said X-Ray machines to the TSA.</p>

<p>What&#39;s especially telling of Example 2 is that if this wasn&#39;t the case and everyone was out for our best interests, the gov&#39;t would have invested money in proper personnel training (ie., what they have in Israel airports).  It would have also served the purpose of raising skill levels of a few thousand citizens who might otherwise be unemployed.  However, that wouldn&#39;t have been much of a payday for anyone at the top.  X-Ray machines though, I guarantee that a very small number of people made millions from it.</p>
