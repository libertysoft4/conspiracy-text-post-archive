    <div class="md"><p>A dynastic, international network of very powerful people (bankers, industry giants, etc.) controls the progression of civilization. Their game is power: how to get it and how to keep it. A lot of people think these people are part of some Reptilian cult known as the Illuminati, but unbeknownst to them it&#39;s actually just propaganda from the same elite circle of people that have them chasing fables, utterly and completely distracted from what&#39;s really there. </p>

<p>As for the Illuminati, they are an organization officially and founded by Pythagoras. Before then they weren&#39;t known as &quot;the Illuminati&quot;, they were just nomadic mystics that recorded the secret history of mankind and consequently possessed ancient spiritual knowledge regarding the true workings of God and the universe. The Illuminati consists of only the greatest minds the world has ever seen, with members including Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, Hegel, and even Carl Jung (who allegedly lacked the discipline required of the Illuminati, but he did work with them). The Illuminati were the spark that caused the French <em>and</em> American revolutions, and they will be the spark to end the Satanic regime of oppression once and for all, <em>very</em> soon. Their aim is to completely liberate mankind from the grips of the &quot;old world order&quot; as they call it; the perpetuators of the emulated serfdom we call &quot;jobs&quot; and &quot;careers&quot; that distract us from what&#39;s truly important in our lives. Once the &quot;old world order&quot; has been eliminated, mankind will realize its divine potential and unify with it. That&#39;s the goal of &quot;Illuminism&quot;.</p>

<p><a href="http://armageddonconspiracy.co.uk/">The Illuminati have their own website and update it with a new article about once every 2 weeks, incrementally revealing more and more information. You can even email them and ask them questions.</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>I asked this same question recently and was provided with some great information. Check out this documentary by Ryan Dawson. He is an American living in Japan with his Japanese wife and daughter and is a martial artist / patriot. He creates a very compelling argument without being racist towards Judaism nor radical in his beliefs. David Icke is a bit radical in certain beliefs but this article is great as well.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve never seen him talk about shapeshifting lizards or aliens.  Is it hyperbole in the way I may call someone a snake, or do you believe he&#39;s literally saying some world leaders are the progeny of reptiles?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not really sure.  The reptile aspect could easily be a reference to the lower brain forms and fear, greed, etc.  The way he presents it is literal truth but I wouldn&#39;t put it past him or be surprised at if he veils his ideas in hyperbole.  This could serve a couple purposes.  First to protect himself, if he is seen as &quot;crazy&quot; there&#39;s less chance of him being suicided.  Secondly, if there are certain parts of his ideas that are clearly false, it would encourage his followers not to take everything he says as absolute truth, but to employ their own critical thinking skills and come up with their own ideas.  </p>

<p>Personally I don&#39;t think it matters much, I&#39;d be fine with either reality.  What&#39;s important is to recognize the problems with &quot;the system&quot; are innate.  To use an expression, we gotta throw the bums out!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It is not hyperbole, he has an entire theory on reptilian humanoid aliens with a bloodline that goes back centuries. If you have some time get some popcorn and watch his documentary with Credo Mutwa a very intelligent Zulu Shaman. It&#39;s interesting to listen to Credo&#39;s story about his necklace to say the least (best parts around part 13-14 and on). But yes it is hard to believe that Reptilian Humanoids still exist if they did at one point in history and rule the world behind the curtains. But when you get into the realm of conspiracy anything is possible; you must decide for yourself what to believe!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not hyperbole. He claims that the elite &quot;blue-bloods&quot; in our society are reptilian shape-shifters, able to project a human form that fools us on a daily basis.                        </p>

<p>This lineage is headed by the British Royal Family (the Queen Mother apparently was a bad ass). The Bush family, amongst many other historically influential families, are supposedly blood relatives.<br/>
Also, Princess Diana was sacrificed in a Prince Philip directed, MI6 black-op.                              </p>

<p>David Icke talks a lot of sense in some areas. He loses me at other points though.<br/>

    <div class="md"><p>That is the mystery of all mysteries... Who is at the top of the pyramid?
According to the theories, everything that influences us is pretty much controlled by whoever/whatever is at the top of the pyramid. The people (or whatever) at the top of the pyramid, who control the agenda, are not really known. </p>

<p>However, in descending order of importance in the hierarchy (not a complete list but just off the top of my head), some theorize that goes that it is something like this:</p>

<p>The people</p>

<p>The local authorities (state, city and police)</p>

<p>The government and government organizations (EPA, CIA, the Military etc. etc.)</p>

<p>The Media</p>

<p>NGOs, scientific bodies, religious organizations (Mormons) etc.</p>

<p>The White House</p>

<p>The corporations (Monsanto, BP, Halliburton, drug companies etc.)</p>

<p>The Federal Reserve and other central Banks</p>

<p>The UN and IMF</p>

<p>The Banking Families</p>

<p>Secret and Private Societies (Bilderberg, CFR etc.)</p>

<p>Royalty and the Vatican (disputable)</p>

<p>The top of the pyramid is down to speculation, but many people believe that there are some kind of aliens, satanic forces, or interdimensional beings involved.</p>

<p>I would advise you to do your own research on this... it&#39;s pretty interesting, but there is a lot of disinformation out there... so I don&#39;t think anyone can say for sure what is really going on. However, if you look at the hierarchy in these terms, a lot of stuff that didn&#39;t make sense before, does start making more sense...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I found this book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Unseen-Hand-Ralph-Epperson/dp/0961413506">The Unseen Hand</a> to be an excellent description of the power elite.  It doesn&#39;t matter what you call them because that is just a name however you can know them by their fruits, the pudding and all of that.  There appears to be a particular methodology that can be intuitively felt once you have studied their method and certain connections have been demonstrated for you.  It would be impossible for me to watch television now like a child with my mouth hanging open and a glazed over look.  The attack on my reason and mental health is just too abrupt and awkward at this point.  I only watch or listen to mainstream news sources when I want to understand what the larger agenda is behind particular events.  Often times I am unsure what the payload of a particular event is from searching for the truth so I need to watch what is directed at the masses.  Usually they are so blatantly obvious and crude in the delivery that I am able to decipher the intent within 2-10 minutes.  Listening and watching beyond that seems to not yield much results for me because they tend to repeat concepts over and over again minute by minute and if not then their conclusions imply this twisted reasoning that they are prone to commit.  That is the way that I go about understanding what I can.  The names are not that important as the ideologies and methodologies.  Once you have a firm grasp on these it is possible to recognize when one has inherited them or is a victim of them.  In essence they do not want to work and they want us to do the working for them, beyond that it is just big words and immoral axioms.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Banking elites have the capital to influence and orchestrate political and economic activity, however there are also very powerful individuals who have what I call ideological power.  Technocrats like Henry Kissinger and Zbigniew Brzezinski are not nearly as wealthy as the British Royalty, the Rothschilds, or the Rockefellers, but their accumulated respect from less informed politicians have given them the power of persuasion and they still very much effect policy today.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s a very short list</p>

<p>British and Dutch Royalty, Rothschild&#39;s, Rockefeller&#39;s, CEO&#39;s of the top too-big-to-fail banks: Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan Chase, Bank of America, and Citibank, Kissinger, George Soros, Brzezinski, Dick Cheney, the Bush family, and others.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There is a lot of things that I disagree with on this theory but there is also some evidence that supports at least a bit of his theory. The best representation is his own video interviews with Credo Mutwa regarding the Necklace of Mysteries that was supposedly stolen from him in Swaziland. Check it out, its REALLY long if you watch the whole thing, or start around part 13 or 14 where it starts to talk about the necklace. He calls them the &quot;Chitauri&quot; and believes they have been around for centuries. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;The greatest form of control is when you think you&#39;re free when you&#39;re being fundamentally manipulated and dictated to.

The other one is sitting in a prison cell but you can&#39;t see the bars but you think you&#39;re free.&quot; </p>
