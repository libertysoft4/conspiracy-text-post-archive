    <div class="md"><p>WTC7, a 48 story building collapsed at free fall speed in it&#39;s own footprint. It just happened to be home to some of the most important offices outside of DC for the IRS, CIA, Secret Service, and the SEC....which subsequently lost all the files for the cases against Enron.</p>

<p>Fligh 93, disintegrated upon impact, yet left a debris field 6 miles away where investigators found all of the paper passports belonging to the hijackers. Same thing for WTC1 &amp; WTC2.</p>

<p>The commission report claims WTC 1&amp;2 fell due to kerosene (jet fuel) fires melting steel columns, yet there are several published pictures of people in both buildings standing in the holes where the planes hit, waving flags to be rescued.</p>

<p>The day of 9/11, all of the air force bases in the NE and possible across the country, I would have to look that part up, were running a simulation to prepare for an event where commercial airliners are hijacked and used as weapons to run into....wait for it.....the pentagon, the white house, and.....sky scrapers in NYC.</p>

<p>The evening of 9/10 Donald Rumsfeld announced the DoD could not account for $2.3 Trillion in it&#39;s budget....the next day a commercial jet flew into the Armed Services budget office at the Pentagon.</p>

<p>Where are the videos of the Pentagon, besides the 10 or so frames the FBI release? There are many other locations that had security cameras with perfect views.</p>

<p>At bare minimum, the 9/11 Commission did a piss poor job in it&#39;s report, and we need a new, independent commission to investigate....but that&#39;s not likely to happen.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There are several mistakes here.</p>

<p>WTC 7 did not collapse into its own footprint. In fact it was laying in the street and damaged other buildings next to it. I can provide photographic evidence of it leaning while it fell. I can provide pictures of the damage is caused to the other buildings.</p>

<p>They did not find &quot;all of the paper passports&quot;. I will be happy to list all the passports that were found, what condition they were in, and when they were found. And they were not &quot;all of them&quot;. You ignore the fact that none of the 9/11 hijackers who lived in this country for months leading up to the attacks ever attempted to conceal their identity at any point. They had bills, credit cards, and residences all in their name. There is an extensive paper trail.</p>

<p>The people were where the fires were not. Those who were near the fire jumped to their deaths rather then be burned alive. A person here during this time is not evidence that there wasn&#39;t fires going on in other places of the building. </p>

<p>There was no stand down ordered, none of the war games of the day had anything to do with the white house, the pentagon, or the sky scrapers in NYC. This is just a lie. 9/11 deniers mix them all into one statement to confuse the issue. Anyone who looks at these action individually will see that they had no negative influence on the response that day. In fact, it has been cited that the war games going on had a positive influence on the response times because the people were already where they needed to be.</p>

<p>We lose all kinds of money in this country all the time. You are taking an entire speech out of context and reducing it to a sentence. Try actually reading the actual speech.</p>

<p>Who said such videos exist? People used to cite the Citgo station and the doubletree videos as proof that the government was holding back evidence, but in fact those tapes were released and show absolutely nothing. Just because you think their may be other video evidence, that doesn&#39;t mean there is. There are tons of physical evidence, 70+ witnesses, bodies, and matching plane parts to the flight that crashed into the pentagon.</p>

<p>I&#39;ll be happy to go though any one of these points in fine detail if you like, I have researched them all and I am well read on every one of these subjects.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>its obvious you haven&#39;t reviewed the truth out there, you merely formulated your opinions based on what you saw on public media and refuse to accept what&#39;s true.</p>

<p>In the case of the videos, the only video out there shows the before and after effect of the plane hitting the pentagon, you don&#39;t see a plane at all....</p>

<p>A huge Boeing jetline crashes into the pentagon and no-one can get visual evidence of it happening!? If a big jet crashes into the pentagon carrying a near full load of fuel, and only causes that small of damage what makes you Believe that a jet crashing into a top floor of a skyscraper can compromise the entire building&#39;s foundation?... was it the media?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Actually I have reviewed &quot;the truth&quot; out there. I&#39;ve read everything from Loose Change, to Judy Wood&#39;s no plane space laser theory.  What set me apart is I read the &quot;truth&quot; and the criticism of the &quot;truth&quot;. I encourage anyone to do so, as it becomes really obvious on how <strong>real truth</strong> the truthers believe in.</p>

<p>Yes, of course you don&#39;t see a plane at all. It was moving at 500mph, and the camera capturing it was the equivalent of a webcam. A small, cheap, tiny res camera that you could pick up for less then 50 dollars at the time. The Pentagon has really good security. As in a large number of <strong>people</strong> working around the building. People are really good at spotting car bombs, and crazy people. People are really bad at stopping planes moving at 500mph. There is no need to have an extensive camera system around the Pentagon, because there are actually people there instead of cameras. Places that have a lot of cameras don&#39;t have a lot of people. The Pentagon isn&#39;t one of these places.</p>

<p>The witnesses some as close at 50 feet away, saw a plane. I don&#39;t know about you, but you should drive to an airport and get as close as you can to the runway. You will still be further then 50 feet away. So how anyone can confuse a missile (essentially a flying telephone pole) with a really really big plane from 50 feet away is impossible. Just on that alone is enough to throw everything truthers say out the window. Seriously, go to your local airport and park near the runway.</p>

<p><a href="http://i.imgur.com/BisG3.jpg">Also, how does a missile zigzag like this?</a></p>

<p>Some people say the plane flew over the Pentagon, so how did it disappear from radar? Are the control towers of every major airport in the area in on it too? They record radar data. You can watch it. It&#39;s there on youtube. The plane takes off, it flies toward its destination, it turns around, and disappears around the Pentagon. If the plane flew over the pentagon, how did it suddenly transform into a stealth fighter and elude radar detection?</p>

<p>Small amount of damage? Really? Have you ever been next to the Pentagon? The building is HUGE. So if you look at pictures you really are missing the scale of the damage. Not to mention it was being reinforced at the time because of the growing threat of car bombs (Oklahoma City).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Just being devil&#39;s advocate here, but I&#39;d like to point out that the Pentagon&#39;s perimeter was in fact guarded by over 175 cameras. I find it a bit mystifying that apparently not a single other one of them was able to capture something so large. </p>

<p>Never mind the fact that it was supposedly also guarded by an anti-aircraft battery, but that&#39;s just an inconvenient fact to point out, I guess. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I tend to agree that this is probably false for the following reason: If I were the people trying to create this false flag, there is no reason for me to use a missile when I can just use the plane. For the same reason the laser thing is naive, and probably meant to discredit.</p>

<p>I would however create the impression that I&#39;m hiding something, like having used a missile, so that if things get serious I can simply release a video of the airplane and make fools of those people and have them loose their credibility.</p>

<p>I would try to do everything as close to the official version as possible, with some amount of intentional unneeded secrecy around things I can control.</p>

<p>What I can&#39;t make like the official version is, for example, the explosions in the twin towers. I would need to have the buildings collapse completely to insure support for a long war, but airplanes alone won&#39;t (insure the) bringing down of 2 buildings designed especially for sustaining low-speed airplane impacts. Therefore explosives are used, and the people who point out the evidence that explosives were used will be mixed together with people who say that a missile hit the pentagon or lasers were used, and discredit them all as a group.</p>

<p>What would cause me real trouble would be another investigation. So I would release all kind of naive seemingly-possible theories and have people repeat them, so I can use ad hominem attacks against the whole group.</p>

<p>Also, I&#39;d like to point out that those security cameras are more than likely pointed at points of interest other than a nearby highway, or the middle of the lawn, or the side of the building. Not only that but if you&#39;re going to a system of &quot;175&quot; cameras recording constantly and storing at least a couple days if not more of video you have to use some low res low framerate cameras. You don&#39;t use these cameras in places that you want to see people&#39;s faces, you do use them outside where you want to see big things, like cars. But they did have one camera that caught it! Guess why that camera was there? It was monitoring a point of interest. Guess why they aren&#39;t coming out to prove you wrong with data about where every single one of their camera&#39;s point, how many there are, and what frame rate they record at? I think you can handle that one on your own, but if not I can make you a youtube video.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Prove me wrong about what? I merely pointed out that there are LOTS of cameras at the Pentagon, not &quot;none&quot;, like _dimension implied. </p>

<p>I like though, that you assume the Pentagon would be so technologically backwards that they&#39;d be forced to use low-res, low-framerate cameras. And how you don&#39;t provide a shred of evidence to back up the claim. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I like how you address only one of my 6 counter points to what you said and then ask me for citation on the quality of cameras that pentagon would use in for all-weather observation of large objects 10 years ago. Remember before 9/11 it was a bad thing to have a big &quot;homeland security&quot; budget. They weren&#39;t forced to do anything, they chose to. If you think they slapped high definition camera&#39;s in custom weatherproof casings and mounted of them on the outside pointing in every goddamn direction you&#39;ve completely given up reason. But if evidence is that important to you I&#39;m sure the type of camera they have installed is buried in their public budget records from before 2001, hidden with sinister intent obviously. Since you&#39;re the one that can&#39;t propose an argument that makes holds water and need it to believe in the obvious truth you can be the one to dig it up. While we&#39;re on the subject of citation I looked up the validity of your anti-aircraft claim. <a href="http://www.jod911.com/There_Are_No_Missile_Defenses_at_the_Pentagon.pdf">Here</a> is a paper that goes over every source of that information (none of it was government official) and discredits it. The paper then goes on to provide this contrary evidence to your statement:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The proof lies in the fact that the Pentagon was forced to emplace missile defenses at the Pentagon after 9/11, 
from CNN September 11th, 2002.
For the first time since the Cuban missile crisis almost 40 years ago, armed missile launchers 
will be protecting the nation&#39;s capital by day&#39;s end Tuesday -- a precaution that comes amid a 
heightened alert status on the eve of the one-year anniversary of the September 11 attacks.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If you can&#39;t bother to read the other side of every conspiracy you have lost the ability for critical thinking and are simply a tool for people creating lies in order to make money off people like you. If you still believe in your 2 points after this then you&#39;re simply someone who has no place in a researched discourse.</p>

<p>Just to clear this up as well, _dimension implied simply that there is no need for an extensive camera system on the outside of a building that has armed guard around the whole perimeter on a 24/7 basis and I agree with his logic fully.</p>

<p>Some people say the plane flew over the Pentagon, so how did it disappear from radar? Are the control towers of every major airport in the area in on it too? They record radar data. You can watch it. It&#39;s there on youtube. The plane takes off, it flies toward its destination, it turns around, and disappears around the Pentagon. If the plane flew over the pentagon, how did it suddenly transform into a stealth fighter and elude radar detection?</p>

<p>Just nitpicking here, I don&#39;t want to get involved in an argument, but as I understand it civilian air control relies on transponders built into the aircraft to locate them, not on actual RADAR</p>

<p>How can you seriously believe a Jetliner that&#39;s FULL OF FUEL going at 500MPH (as you said) can only do the damage that was seen on the Pentagon... the foundation barley crumbled, most of it remained intact. <em>I urge you to watch the video I linked in my previous post</em>... You seem very opinionated but just LOOK AT THE FACTS, DON&#39;T ASSUME JUST LOOK AT WHAT&#39;S THERE.</p>

<p>LOOK AT THE indepth analysis... If you believe that 9/11 wasn&#39;t an inside job I would [rationally] assume you believe there were [infact] weapons of mass destruction in Iraq (No conspiracy just BULL Shit)</p>

<p>--edit--</p>

<p>Just read a little bit more and realized that you stated </p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;There is no need to have an extensive camera system around the Pentagon, because there are actually people there instead of cameras.&quot; </p>

<p><strong>False.</strong> I don&#39;t think you realize how security works... especially the world &quot;superpower&#39;s&quot; secure central  hub... furthermore there are Numerous cameras that surround just that specific area &amp; this point is addressed in that video.</p>

<p>You visit this subreddit for a reason, look at the proof around you to justify the truth. I started off visiting this sub-reddit in an attempt to find the truth, and once you seek it... it&#39;s overwhelming.</p>

<p>You think I&#39;d be arguing against you and waisting my time to tell you your wrong? What do I really have to gain? ... My only interest is exposing and spreading the truth, exposing reality for what it really.</p>

<p>how you conspiracy theorists look to us</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;m fairly proud of the fact that I can claim the mantle of conspiracy theorist.</p>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quis_custodiet_ipsos_custodes%3F">Who watches the watchmen?</a></p>

<p>Many of the posts here point out inconsistencies which haven&#39;t been resolved.</p>

<p>Some of the posts are rehashing stuff over and over (Kennedy assassination, chemtrails, etc.).</p>

<p>I&#39;ve only been here a little over a year and in that time I&#39;ve learned a LOT (not all) about how this specific forum works.</p>

<p>The long time regulars have their &quot;agendas&quot; (The &quot;Joos&quot; seems to be a recurring favorite for some, with others its chemtrails and flouride, and so on and so forth). But, every time it comes to 9/11, it&#39;s the same two crowds...</p>

<p>Those who distrust the government (for a long history of somewhat glaring, obvious reasons), and those who want to argue with them. This is somewhat frustrating for the following reason...</p>

<p>This subreddit is for discussion of conspiracy-related topics (it&#39;s &quot;home of those who have theories about conspiracies&quot;). </p>

<p>Inevitably, however, there are people who come here for the sole purpose of stirring up grief among an otherwise cohesive group of people (cohesive in the sense that they all respect each other&#39;s right to have their pet theory). These &quot;muckrakers&quot; aren&#39;t here to have a discussion... they inevitably enter into conversation threads with sarcasm, mockery, and namecalling... and when they get a heated argument brewing, they say &quot;see? I told you you were irrational.&quot;</p>

<p>So, krelian, why are YOU here? To learn stuff the mainstream media won&#39;t tell you? Or to point, mock, and laugh?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>At no point did I compare the sizes of the various missiles to that of an airliner.  I produced images of missiles that have wings and markings similar to those on airplanes.   These could easily be mistaken for airplanes from a distance even if they were sitting motionless on a tarmac.  </p>

<p>I have seen many witness accounts from 9-11.  Some people claim to have seen airliners and even to have been able to read the &quot;AA&quot; on a plane moving at 500mph.  Others described a smaller plane or even &#39;a cruise missile with wings&#39;.  </p>

<p>I have no firm position on this matter.  Eyewitness testimony is notoriously inaccurate.  </p>

<p>I think it&#39;s wrong to cite the high speed of the object as a reason the cameras couldn&#39;t capture it clearly yet then imply that people could have clearly made out what it was (down to reading the letters on the tail fins) when it was only over the lawn for a few seconds while traveling at incredible speeds.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t think that is unreasonable at all, although I do wonder about the existence of additional security tape from the Pentagon and surrounding businesses.  </p>

<p>As my previous post stated, I am familiar with the many and varied eyewitness accounts.  They don&#39;t prove or disprove anything in my opinion.  Some people clearly saw the &quot;AA&quot; on the tail despite the 500 mph speed you keep quoting.  Others saw a small plane.  Others saw a &#39;missile with wings&#39;.  </p>

<p>You keep pointing to the 500mph speed with regards to the camera&#39;s limitations but don&#39;t  seem to think that human beings whose attention would not have already been focused on the point of impact (as the camera was) would have any trouble discerning an out of place object moving at that same speed.</p>

<p>Again, I am not even of the opinion that a missile hit the Pentagon.  I have no clue what happened.  Your mind is clearly made up on the matter.  Mine is still open...and I try to look at both sides with interest and skepticism.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>How about me?  I&#39;m an eyewitness to the strike at the Pentagon.  I lived in Alexandria at the time and was out on my balcony at a high-rise on 395.  I saw a flash out of the corner of my eye, looked north up 395, and zeroed in on a flying object crossing the highway and IIRC, at a slightly northeast trajectory from where I was standing. I watched as it zipped across the road and parking lot and hit the outside wall of the building.  The explosion wasn&#39;t nearly as large as the ones on tape at the WTC.</p>

<p>And I&#39;ll tell you something.  In some reports over the years, there&#39;s a claim that the plane tilted its wings toward the south or east as it went low.  From my viewing angle, above and south, the wings would have been instantly visible.  There were no wings at all anywhere that I could see.  And the the fuselage sure wasn&#39;t of the size or shape of the plane they claim was used, as far as I could tell after years of googling plane images and comparing scales and so on.</p>

<p>And as a person who drove or took the bus to the Pentagon for 3 years, sometimes as an employee there and sometimes as an employee elsewhere using the 7W bus to get to the metro station there, the facade at no time looked like it was hit by such a large plane, nor any form of wing marks evident.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is akin to how people describe tornadoes as sounding like &quot;freight trains&quot;. They know it was a tornado, it destroyed their house, but they still tell people when asked that it sounded like a train. Why? Because people don&#39;t have tornadoes go over them everyday, and not too many people have a good idea of what they sound like.</p>

<p>How many people here have heard a plane hitting a building? Probably none. How many, if they did, would be cynical enough to tell the reporter &quot;It sounded like a plane hitting a building&quot;? Most people would do the usual train/tornado thing, and say it sounded like a bomb, or a missile, or whatever, and use some analogy or something they have heard. A lot of the people who work at the pentagon <em>have</em> been in active duty at some point, and probably have heard a lot more missiles and bombs going off, than planes hitting buildings.</p>

<p>People like to forget this <em>was the pentagon</em> and full of military, and people who work with those kinds of technologies for a living.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t understand how you could take &#39;many people said they saw a missile&#39; from that.  The rest of the arguments aside, this is not valid.  All but one or two mentions of missiles are something like this:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>saw the plane dive down and level off. &quot;It was no more than 30 feet off the ground, and it was screaming. It was just screaming. It was nothing more than a guided missile at that point</p>
</blockquote>

<p>or</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Suddenly, an airplane roared into view, nearly shearing the roof off the trailer before slamming into the E ring. It sounded like a missile</p>
</blockquote>

<p>or </p>

<blockquote>
<p>But whoever was flying the plane made no attempt to change direction. It was coming in at a high rate of speed, but not at a steep angle--almost like a heat-seeking missile</p>

<p>These all clearly say that what they saw was a plane, even if they draw up comparisons to a missile.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>you are saying this based on the amount of &quot;I saw a plane&quot; eye witnesses. I highly doubt you&#39;ve gone through every case of i saw a plane and &quot;i saw a missile&quot; - that being said i&#39;ve read both, and logically speaking a boeing jet full of jet fuel would make an explosion way bigger then this, and would take out more then one side of the pentagon, should take out atleast two, one from the impact and the second from the explosion. </p>

<p>I believe this is a very good point, doesn&#39;t take a conspiracy theorist to use logic --&gt; </p>

<p>A huge Boeing jetline crashes into the pentagon and no-one can get visual evidence of it happening!?

    <div class="md"><p>not according to me, according to the size of a jet liner fuel tank, i&#39;m sorry is that so hard to consider? </p>

<p>The amount of bullshit spat at gullible viewers feels managed, and the whole &quot;a plane hit the pentagon&quot; thing feels like a misdirection. I side with the large number of non-viewable airplane video evidence to the approach and impact, as well as the plane parts that didn&#39;t seem to exist after impact. </p>

<p>there are too many holes for a terrorist attack.. remember those oklahoma city bombings? was there ever such big speculation as to who and why and how did it? no it was down right and simple because it was a case of actual domestic violence, the news on it was straightforward as was the proceedings on dealing with it, etc. </p>

<li><p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaBQ3AkRetI">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaBQ3AkRetI</a> from this demolition we can see that at various points the building looks to be leaning 1 way or another.  I want to see the pictures you were talking about, as I strongly suspect they may be cause of this issue.  A photo of it leaning is hardly enough.  And it doesn&#39;t take much out of the imagination to see debris flying out and hitting other buildings, so I don&#39;t really see that as something that trumps the controlled demolition theory.</p></li>
<li><p>The fact that those war games went on at the exact same time and date with such similarities as 9/11 is the epitome of suspicious.  Calling it &quot;just a lie&quot; is an insult to basic intuition.  There are no documents to support one or the other (One wouldn&#39;t make sense, &quot;These drills will have nothing to do with any similar attack that might happen on this day,&quot; while on the other side, this whole thing would be a closed case and we wouldn&#39;t be having this discussion to begin with), you&#39;d pretty much have to rely on your own thought and reasoning.  With the many other strange happenings on 9/11, to simply pass off one of the biggest ones as if there&#39;s absolutely nothing to do with it, well, I told myself I wouldn&#39;t resort to petty name calling, but that&#39;s just stupid on your part.  Also, the war games did NOT make things easier.  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ef8IY3zKEcc&amp;amp;feature=related">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ef8IY3zKEcc&amp;amp;feature=related</a>  Listening to the people&#39;s voices, how they spoke, their tone, ect shows that they were left with their pants down.  You are very wrong in thinking that there wasn&#39;t chaos and confusion that slowed everything down, regardless of what citations you speak of.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNfkej6YyeY">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNfkej6YyeY</a> this is but 1 example of a video tape that the FBI confiscated that had some sort of video on 9/11.  The only reason it was released was because of a lawsuit.  If it wasn&#39;t for the lawsuit, we would&#39;ve still not heard of it.  Again, basic reasoning goes into this, if you don&#39;t want to believe what is being said about there being dozens of security cameras that took videos of it (You can find several more tapes of ppl saying that the FBI took their tapes and whatnot on youtube as well), then just think of all the buildings around the pentagon with security cameras that just so happen to have the pentagon in view.  It is not that much of a stretch of the imagination.  If you live in a city, just choose some big important building, then look around that building at all the stores around it and how you would expect their security cameras to face.  Doesn&#39;t take much to think of that one.  On a side note, I sure hope you don&#39;t think that the FBI didn&#39;t take any tapes, you kind of inferred that when you were talking about the tapes.  Also, just because you think there isn&#39;t other tapes, doesn&#39;t mean there isn&#39;t.  Your argument can be swung both ways.</p></li>
<li><p>there are also witnesses that have said stuff that it looks like a missile, they saw a plane fly above the pentagon, ect.  Assuming there was a conspiracy actually in place, it is no wonder why some of those interviews weren&#39;t put live on air.  The anchor on the ground could simply ask them before filming what they saw, and if it matched up with what they would want to put on TV, they then go live on the air and ask the person.  This is not really uncommon, many times reporters and whatnot would talk to ppl about how things will go in an interview before taping/going live.  Of course, some times things don&#39;t always go as planned, and live tv is more difficult to edit than regular tv.  At the same time, the reporter can tell them after they speak fo what was seen, &quot;Alright, this&#39;ll be live on the air, I want you to say _____.&quot;  On a day like that, which the ppl would be very shaken up, it is not difficult to think that they would go along with it.  If they thought they saw a missile, and the reporter said &quot;No, it was actually a plane, please say that,&quot; they would most likely do it.  On the other hand, if no conspiracy was at play, then why would the people be saying such random, untrue things?  That would not make any sense at all.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>This is just stuff I scrounged up in like a bit over a half an hour.  To be frank, you don&#39;t sound to be very well educated and well researched, from the sounds of it it was merely a case of you typing in &gt;insert conspiracy theory&lt; debunked in google then picking out a few choice sites.  That is not to say that a lot of 9/11 ppl aren&#39;t in the same boat, but this and your other posts make you sound too much like a pompus ass, and really THAT is what made me decide to scrounge up this quick post for you.</p>

<li><p>Do you notice how loud a controlled demolition is? The only reason thermite is brought up is because it is much more quiet then conventional explosives. Truthers ignore the fact that you would need thousands of pounds and weeks to prepare a building for demolition. The way they try to get around this is by inventing nanothermite... a super secret version of thermite that deals with all the problems with conventional thermite. The only problem is nanothermite doesn&#39;t exist. It never existed. The only reason truthers bring it out is because a national laboratory theorized it, and that was good enough for the truthers.</p></li>
<li><p>The war games had to do with Russian Bombers over Alaska and Canada... how does that have ANYTHING to do with 9/11? Oh I agree we were caught with out pants down, but there is a far difference between knowingly subverting our air defense and 9/11. Before 9/11 hijackings were not suicide runs. The link you provide supports my claims. We were unprepared for 9/11, that does not mean 9/11 was an inside job.</p></li>
<li><p>The double tree hotel video was used as proof that there was a coverup. Then the government released the tape and truthers are still crying there is a coverup? You have your double tree video, you have your citgo video... they don&#39;t show anything... just because there is a lack of evidence, that doesn&#39;t mean there is any evidence.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://911research.wtc7.net/pentagon/evidence/witnesses/sgydk.html">Why don&#39;t you read what they actually saw? I did.</a></p></li>

<p>Frankly, I don&#39;t think you read much anything at all. I think you looked at some conspiracy youtube videos without even reading anything for yourself. I read all that. I&#39;ve read everything from both sides I could get my hands on.</p>

    <div class="md"><ol>
<li><p>Kind of a change in topics, but alright.  I did in fact notice how loud the controlled demolition is.  As you said, thermite is given as an explanation, and a very legit one at that.  If it is more quiet than conventional explosives, then it would make perfect sense for them to use that one instead.  Truthers don&#39;t ignore that part at all, there have been some explanations covering those parts, parts which I myself have been sketchy about so I personally don&#39;t like to bring it up.  As with the rest of us on either side, I don&#39;t have all the pieces to the puzzle.  But I do know that the basic human hivemind would not ask questions if they saw some random official looking people around their building every now and then, they would just shrug it off, say its for another dept, and be on their way with their own business.  Now, I&#39;m having some real big issue with the way you are describing nanothermite.  What you mean inventing?  It&#39;s been researched by the U.S. military since the early 1990&#39;s.  Conspiracy theorists didn&#39;t invent anything with that.  And it is not super secretive, nothing about it is.  Quit trying to muddy the issue by saying such random, made up things, that is all you are doing by saying such lies.  I have to admit, you made me briefly question myself and made me look up nanothermite to see if I&#39;ve been following a lie.  This non-existent super secretive thing has a wikipedia page among other things.  <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=nanothermite&amp;amp;ie=utf-8&amp;amp;oe=utf-8&amp;amp;aq=t&amp;amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&amp;amp;client=firefox-a#sclient=psy&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;safe=off&amp;amp;client=firefox-a&amp;amp;hs=9aS&amp;amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-US%3Aofficial&amp;amp;q=nano+thermite+-9%2F11+-wtc+-towers&amp;amp;aq=f&amp;amp;aqi=&amp;amp;aql=&amp;amp;oq=&amp;amp;pbx=1&amp;amp;fp=241062ed1d424d73">http://www.google.com/search?q=nanothermite&amp;amp;ie=utf-8&amp;amp;oe=utf-8&amp;amp;aq=t&amp;amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&amp;amp;client=firefox-a#sclient=psy&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;safe=off&amp;amp;client=firefox-a&amp;amp;hs=9aS&amp;amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-US%3Aofficial&amp;amp;q=nano+thermite+-9%2F11+-wtc+-towers&amp;amp;aq=f&amp;amp;aqi=&amp;amp;aql=&amp;amp;oq=&amp;amp;pbx=1&amp;amp;fp=241062ed1d424d73</a>  Where do you get this made up stuff from?</p></li>
<li><p>Yeah, of course they&#39;re going to have to give a reason for conducting the war games.  While we should know why they wanted to do those war games to begin with, we shouldn&#39;t immediately be satisfied with the first reason they give us though.  The government lies, always has, probably always will.  If the conspiracy is right, it doesn&#39;t take much to figure out that they&#39;re going to say the war games were for a different reason.  Doesn&#39;t take much critical thinking here.</p></li>
<li><p>You are taking the original point of the double tree video out of context.  There was no reason, ESPECIALLY if the video didn&#39;t have anything to show, to keep it from the people for so long, let alone requiring a lawsuit.  It is for that reason that I see that they had no issue releasing that particular video, much like that other pentagon one; because it had nothing to show.  Doesn&#39;t matter if there were hundreds upon hundreds of video cameras pointed directly at the crash site, if they confiscate them all but release the 1 or 2 tapes that don&#39;t show anything, that&#39;ll be enough to convince people such as yourself that there&#39;s nothing going on.  The hundreds and hundreds of tapes was just to illustrate my point, nothing else.  On the other hand, just throwing random theories out there, if the video did by chance show something like some other plane flying above the pentagon, a year would be more than enough time to remove it via editing.  But I don&#39;t really have much to go by that, I&#39;m just using it as an example of things that could be done behind the scenes.</p></li>
<li><p>Oh, hey, look, a website dedicated to debunking 9/11 truthers, I&#39;m SURE they&#39;ll post evidence and testimonials against what they&#39;re trying to say.  That was just lazy.  Moving on.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Actually, my whole point about them being passively coerced into altering their stories (&quot;I saw what looked like a missile,&quot;  &#39;It was actually a plane sir, please say that.&quot;) was completely ignored.  I&#39;m not saying all of these are coerced testimonials, and I&#39;m not ignoring them.  You, however, seem to be ignoring my other inquiry about the other eyewitnesses who for some reason said things other to the contrary.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>They collapsed nothing like a controlled demolition. Controlled demolitions have very specific indications. There are explosions with visible squibs preceding the collapse; the explosions are at specific structurally important locations, almost all at the bottom of the building to allow gravity to assist; the explosions are extremely loud.</p>

<p>The current record-holder for the tallest building explosively demolished is the <a href="http://www.controlled-demolition.com/jl-hudson-department-store">J. L. Hudson Department Store</a>, a building one quarter the size of the WTC towers. It took 12,000 pounds of explosives to do it, almost all located on the bottom floors.</p>

<p>Now look at the WTC towers. Imagine what it would take to cause a top-down collapse explosively. Let&#39;s be generous to truthers and say only 4,000 pounds of explosives would have been necessary per floor. Let&#39;s say the phantom bombers who planted the explosives knew they wouldn&#39;t need explosives above floor 80 and below floor 10. If you&#39;re looking at a controlled demolition, you&#39;re looking at one that would have taken, by these highly generous numbers, 280,000 pounds of explosives. Per tower.</p>

<p>But wait, there were no sounds of explosives indicative of regular controlled demolition, so what about thermite? Well, it would take substantially more thermite to cut through those supports than it would regular explosives, assuming you could rig something like that up at all, so you&#39;re talking about around *<em>a million pounds</em> of thermite crammed into the towers.</p>

<p>And if that had happened, today we&#39;d be talking about the day the towers melted.</p>

<p>There is evidence of a standdown.  There are statements from officials, 20 hours worth of audio from Norad, and the simple fact that three of the planes hit their targets without interception.  There is evidence for a standdown, interference from wargames, and more.</p>

<p>You are saying the standdown did not occur and that the wargames did not interfere.  I&#39;m sure you are a bright person, but to me you are just some dude posting on the Internet.  Do you have a secondary source to backup your statement that the standdown did not occur and that the wargames did not interfere?  Did someone with someone with a reputation and investigative skills study this, and publish their work under their own name?  If so, where?

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not arguing with you, as I haven&#39;t read your sources nor do I believe that I know what happened on 9/11 either way.  But the lack of interception is very strange.  If a civillian jetliner goes off radar/course for even moments fighters will scramble to intercept it.  It doesn&#39;t take long, they keep them running on APU power at all times.  Pilot just needs to jump in, light up the engines and go.  </p>

<p>I know this because I worked on many flightlines during my time in the Air Force.  </p>

<p>Basically, unless some major cock-up happens, an airliner that goes off course for any reason should have a fighter escort in a matter of minutes. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>There are fighter pilots all over the US waiting around for planes to go off course? (pre 911)?</p>

<p>I&#39;m not from the US so what do i know, but that just sounds really expensive and a little absurd to me.</p>

<p>The air controllers instantly call up a military base because he loses contact with a jet? and the pilots are suited up waiting for the call?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>They&#39;re not specifically waiting for planes to go off course, but there are always pilots on alert that could get to their jets in a matter of minutes.  It doesn&#39;t cost them much, APU&#39;s don&#39;t use much fuel (relatively speaking) and the pilots are paid the same amount no matter what.  At my base they&#39;d usually sit and play Halo or Crimson Skies in the cool room they built with an HD projector and fully stocked bar.  </p>

<p>I worked bombers mostly, so our combat launches took a bit longer than the fighters  (we could probably get a jet up in the air from a cold start in 5-10 minutes).  The fighter guys would laugh at us for being so slow, haha.  </p>

<p>I don&#39;t have numbers, but I&#39;d imagine that when I would troubleshoot issues on the jet, and bring all 4 engines up to Aug (afterburner), that burned through a lot more fuel in those few minutes than a sitting on APUs all day.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Just check out the timing of when things were reported and when the planes crashed into the buildings. You&#39;ll see how little time they had. Our guys are fast, real fast, but they just weren&#39;t fast enough :(</p>

<p>I&#39;ll quickly break it down.</p>

<p>First plane: 6 minutes before they crashed... they were just about to take off when the planes crashed...</p>

<p>Second plane, they were alerted to the second plane almost at the same time as it crashed</p>

<p>Third plane: was not notified until it was down</p>

<p>Fourth plane: was not notified until it was down</p>

<p>Seriously, don&#39;t take my word for it, go read the timing for youself</p>

<p>Eyewitness account form firehouse magazine:</p>

<p>Captain Chris Boyle
Engine 94 - 18 years</p>

<p>Boyle: ...on the north and east side of 7 it didn’t look like there was any damage at all, but then you looked on the south side of 7 there had to be a hole 20 stories tall in the building, with fire on several floors. Debris was falling down on the building and it didn’t look good.</p>

<p>Firehouse: When you looked at the south side, how close were you to the base of that side?</p>

<p>Boyle: I was standing right next to the building, probably right next to it.</p>

<p>Firehouse: When you had fire on the 20 floors, was it in one window or many?</p>

<p>Boyle: There was a huge gaping hole and it was scattered throughout there. It was a huge hole. I would say it was probably about a third of it, right in the middle of it. And so after Visconti came down and said nobody goes in 7, we said all right, we’ll head back to the command post. We lost touch with him. I never saw him again that day.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Pull, as in pull the fire team out because there&#39;s no hope in hell of putting the fire out and it&#39;s getting dangerous.</p>

<p>After debris hit WTC7, small fires broke out. But the sprinkler system was poorly designed, and there wasn&#39;t enough water pressure for the firefighters that went in to put out the fires. So the fires spread out of control over the course of hours until firefighters noticed a bulge in the building which is an indicator of collapse.</p>

<p>Note: The fires went on for HOURS, spreading uncontrolled to MULTIPLE FLOORS, before the fire chief finally gave up and pulled the team out.</p>

<p>They didn&#39;t need to blow up the building; it was already in the early stages of collapse from the spreading fire.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Step back and think logically for a quick second.</p>

<p>If this was an inside job, why plant the hijackers passports 6 miles away? You wouldn&#39;t, plain and simple. So this argument does more to support the official report than debunk it.</p>

<p>Why would you run simulations across the country to prepare for the very event you&#39;re carrying out the same day? Why run the simulations at all? You wouldn&#39;t. Could it be that they were preparing for something like this because of intel they had received? Much more likely and logical. </p>

<p>If you&#39;re the government, and you want to get rid of incriminating files surely the obvious and logical course of action is to demolish the buildings they were in, killing thousands of innocent people and causing billions in damage while blaming a &quot;fictional&quot; enemy. Again, no, it is not. You&#39;re the fucking government. You just walk in and seize them. End of story.</p>

<p>Sure there are a lot of unanswered questions but that&#39;s what happens when there&#39;s a disaster with so much destruction. Assuming a clear and concise story of exactly what happens is possible in a situation like this probably means you should start seeing a psychiatrist about that schizophrenia problem you have.</p>

<p>Now all that said, did the 9/11 commission do a thorough job in reporting what happened? Of course not, they never were going to. That&#39;s what happens when a question of national security arises. Does it suck that complete transparency wasn&#39;t made? Sure. Would it have been better for us all if full disclosure was allowed? Maybe, maybe not, there&#39;s really no way to tell.</p>

<p>tl;dr: Try to use logic and reason to analyze your arguments first or else people will likely discredit the few decent points you might make.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The point of the 9/11 attacks, at least from the point of view it&#39;s an inside job, is that they were done to get into an otherwise illegal and eternal war for the benefit of the military industrial complex. I don&#39;t know about the simulations the military bases, that&#39;s the first I&#39;ve heard of it, but the debris field was needed to show and to build a memorial to rally around, with the passports to give us enemies. </p>

<p>Remember too, one of the reasons for false flag operations is to create something for the country to rally around, in terms of martyrs or whatever. Sure, the WTC alone is pretty good for that, but Flight 93 was an example of how we fought back, initially. Well-written, if you ask me. It&#39;s not just about the files that were destroyed, it&#39;s about creating an eternal war to fund the complex.</p>

<p>Other pieces of the puzzle include WTC 7 falling down, which is now the first and only instance of a steel-framed skyscraper falling down by fire alone. </p>

<p>Is there concrete evidence? No, of course no, because as you said, they&#39;re the fucking government, and have more money and power than you could imagine. But really, looking back, do you feel 100% certain you were told the truth about the whole thing? I don&#39;t, and the fact that there&#39;s any doubt about it scares me. At least Pearl Harbor (which it&#39;s been likened to) had a definite enemy and visible evidence of what happened.</p>

<p>They were running several simulations that day, so let&#39;s analyze the possible motives behind each one:</p>

<p><strong>Operation Northern Vigilance</strong>, was a NORAD operation which involved deploying fighter aircraft to locations in Alaska and Northern Canada.</p>

<p><strong>Possible motive:</strong> deploy fighter aircraft to the location in the US farthest away from the attack. </p>

<p><strong>Global Guardian and Vigilant Guardian</strong>, organized by United States Strategic Command in cooperation with Space Command and NORAD was a war game that simulated a hijacking of an American flight. The interruption of the war game with real word events led to some confusion for those participating <a href="http://www.vanityfair.com/politics/features/2006/08/norad200608">as evidenced by the NORAD recordings</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Possible Motive:</strong> Confuse the experts.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I <em>AM</em> thinking logically. That&#39;s how I know that your first three arguments don&#39;t debunk anything: they all enlist the limited viewpoint of an outside spectator/civilian, with no access to the actual motives or mindset of the actual criminals, whoever they may turn out to be. While I can think of no reason to plant passports 6 miles away, I can think of no reason NOT to, either. I can think of plenty of reasons why &quot;the government&quot; wouldn&#39;t just walk in and seize incriminating files: reluctance to be seen as totalitarian in the public eye, legal issues, etc. 
And as for the simulations, well, that&#39;s actually quite interesting. You see, the exact same thing happened in London during THEIR bombings. And when you think about it, it does carry some real logistical benefits to set things up this way.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So you&#39;re saying that there was massive cooperation by the US military? So much so that &quot;all of the air force bases in the NE and possible across the country...were running a simulation to prepare for an event where commercial airliners are hijacked...&quot;?</p>

<p>Probably the most compelling argument against the 9/11 conspiracy is that, logistically, it would take a huge number of people to have some form of knowledge about what was happening. To say all of the Air Force bases were involved just adds to that number. If this were in fact orchestrated by the government it could only have been carried out with a bare minimum number of people being involved. Getting all of these other parties involved just doesn&#39;t make sense.</p>

<p>Lastly, I recommend reading up on what logic and reason actually mean. And while you&#39;re at it, look up fallacies of argument as well. You seem to be confusing the two.</p>

<p>Circumstantial evidence- it smells bad, but doesn&#39;t prove anything concrete.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>&#39;Disintegrated&#39; does not mean &#39;Disappeared from Reality&#39;- of course something as large as a plane is going to have a great deal of debris.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The commission report claims WTC 1&amp;2 fell due to kerosene (jet fuel) fires melting steel columns, yet there are several published pictures of people in both buildings standing in the holes where the planes hit, waving flags to be rescued.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Jet fuel isn&#39;t going to instantly liquify the steel columns in a building, just soften and weaken parts of them to the point where they won&#39;t hold a tower up for long. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>The day of 9/11, all of the air force bases in the NE and possible across the country, I would have to look that part up, were running a simulation to prepare for an event where commercial airliners are hijacked and used as weapons to run into....wait for it.....the pentagon, the white house, and.....sky scrapers in NYC.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Please look that part up, a citation is very important here. But if true, it&#39;s unsurprising, since the intelligence community had caught wind of possible 9/11 plans. And again, this isn&#39;t evidence- yep, it&#39;s fishy, but our brains seemed wired to see patterns in coincidence.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The evening of 9/10 Donald Rumsfeld announced the DoD could not account for $2.3 Trillion in it&#39;s budget....the next day a commercial jet flew into the Armed Services budget office at the Pentagon.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I don&#39;t think it&#39;s so crazy or out of the ordinary for the DoD (especially under Rumsfeld) to say &quot;oh hurrr gee I have no idea where that money went&quot;. It&#39;s sad, and it shouldn&#39;t be that way, but I mean, come on, when has the US military budget been completely accounted for? Since when were Rumsfeld et al considered so competent that a fuckup like this is proof of a Reichstag fire? This is bad evidence- you&#39;ve established a motive without any other evidence backing it up. This is like if a neighbor you despised was murdered mysteriously and you were convicted of it because you said you hated that dude.</p>

<p>Have you read the history of paranoia in the Department of Defense? And do you remember how crazy EVERYTHING got in the government in 2001? Here guys, we just got allegedly attacked by foreign nationals, let&#39;s put all our security footage online. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>At bare minimum, the 9/11 Commission did a piss poor job in it&#39;s report, and we need a new, independent commission to investigate....but that&#39;s not likely to happen.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I completely agree! But... a weak commission doesn&#39;t mean that they were being manipulated or doing the manipulating, though. There is a shocking amount of incompetence in government, and not because the gummint is flawed- rather, humans are flawed. We fuck up a lot, but think of our politicians and celebrities as somehow above this. When they slip up in a very human way, it&#39;s a shitstorm or a conspiracy. In actuality, they&#39;re as susceptible to failure as the rest of us, and not some sort of omniescent gods sent from the moon to rule us.</p>

<p>Again, none of this is <em>solid</em> proof of foul play. I empathize with the idea that the truth is out there and being covered up... I have not read a report of exactly what happened on 9/11 that&#39;s satisfied me. I&#39;m just not convinced by Truther claims, most of which which start from the Hypothesis, skip to the Conclusion, and backfill everything in-between.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Going to respond to your points 1 by 1</p>

<ol>
<li><p>the Enron case wasn&#39;t condensed into a single building... If your saying that the Enron case is motive... you forget that A. Enron already collapsed, even if they were going to &quot;protect&quot; it by destroying the case, the company was dead already. B. Enron isn&#39;t or rather, wasn&#39;t a major player in politics, now if there was some major thing about Goldman Sachs, Coca Cola / Pepsi / Boeing / halliburton, MAYBE, but they still don&#39;t have the power to do that.</p></li>
<li><p>It disintegrates on impact because its entire fuel load burns at 1500 degrees. It was traveling at 500-700 MPH (MUCH higher then normal because it crashed after a sharp dive), do you know how a car crash works? Hitting the ground does not make stuff go to 0 mph, its still traveling at that speed.</p></li>
<li><p>The jet fuel does melt steel columns, not sure what you mean to imply by your point, that nobody would be alive to wave flags? You sir are a moron... PEOPLE WERE FUCKING JUMPING OUT OF WINDOWS BECAUSE THEY WERE EXPOSED TO 500+ DEGREE TEMPERATURES JUST FROM BEING NEAR TO THE BURNING FUEL!!!</p></li>
<li><p>This point gives us a reason why it wasn&#39;t done by the gov... If they were doing drills to prevent this sort of thing, you would think it would be counter-intuitive because it would prepare them to stop this sort of thing. Show me something where they were told explicitly not to do these drills, then thats a sketch point still, but closer to logic. Also, air force bases to drills like this all the time. Air force bases actually go through rotations for certain events. Like one day they may be practicing what happens if Cessna crosses into restricted airbase, another day they may practice drills for lost contact with military aircraft. They go through these things all the time.</p></li>
<li><p>You should really get to understanding economics and how defense spending works... He was referring to the fact that continually agencies don&#39;t log expenditures, he was talking about it because defense spending is excessive. The 2.3 trillion was over a period of 30 or so years probably. Even if your saying they took out money to do 9/11... your looking at this tiny piece of evidence in the face of all of the other money trails that show us that the taliban / al qaeda worked together (sorta) to train pilots in commercial jets... and it doesn&#39;t take 2.3 trillion to do any of this...
And really.... if we did this to ourselves, they would be smart enough to not announce shit like this THE DAY BEFORE THEIR ATTACK
If there such big criminal masterminds, how can idiots like you and idiots all over the interwebz find these ridiculous non stories that they say links the U.S. to direct involvement in 9/11.</p></li>
<li><p>There actually weren&#39;t any better placed cameras, and if there were, im guessing a planes burning fuel and impact force will knock those out...</p></li>
<li><p>You haven&#39;t read the 9/11 commission report... Its over 500 pages... It gives insight and recommendations and transcripts for ATC and everything... It was an independent commission. The reason new ones aren&#39;t formed is because A. they did their job properly, and B.  theres no reason to form a new one when the only people who think there should be a new one are idiots who can produce no actual evidence.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Also, to people saying 9/11 commission reports ignore all this stuff... they weren&#39;t going on the internet to look at theories... They were reporting on the facts explicitly and not some BS about a piece of wreckage with a slightly different trajectory (which by the way was a part of a jet turbine that was still spinning / had its own thrust) read all of the 500+ pages it has then talk to me.</p>

<p><a href="http://articles.cnn.com/2001-09-16/us/inv.binladen.denial_1_bin-laden-taliban-supreme-leader-mullah-mohammed-omar?_s=PM:US">Osama denies he had to do with the attack</a></p>

<p>The only thing connecting Bin Laden to the attacks was a tape found in a bombed out building: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/September_11_attacks">&quot;In November 2001, U.S. forces recovered a videotape from a destroyed house in Jalalabad, Afghanistan, in which Osama bin Laden is talking to Khaled al-Harbi.&quot;</a></p>

<p>Most of the videos or audios of him have been found to be most likely fakes:
<a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2002/nov/29/alqaida.terrorism1">2002 Video fake</a></p>

<p><a href="http://news.cnet.com/8301-10784_3-9777136-7.html">2007 video fake</a></p>

<p>Bin Laden has never been indicted for the 9/11 attacks, check the FBI most wanted list, and check his profile... It&#39;s not there, atleast last time I checked it wasn&#39;t.  While your on his profile, check all the things he has been indicted for, then keep this in mind the CIA met up with Osama at a hospital in <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2001/nov/01/afghanistan.terrorism">July of 2001</a>.  Why not arrest him and bring him in?  </p>

<p>My point is that the &quot;official story&quot; is just as much of a conspiracy theory as any other theories out there.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re ending your theory too soon.</p>

<p>1) Afghanistan
2) Iraq</p>

<p>Now take a look at what country is between Afghanistan and Iraq. </p>

<p>3) Iran</p>

<p>Funny how Iran is now the hot topic. Israel seems to want an invasion of Iran more than Obama does. </p>

<p>Take a look at a map of the Middle East and think about it strategically. If we look at past world wars, we see major regime changes that are often marked by the shifting of borders on the map. Now let&#39;s say we do invade Iran while maintaining occupation forces in Afghanistan and Iraq. Meanwhile, Israel deals with Syria and Jordan. When all is said and done, you&#39;ll have a seamless path from Israel all the way to Pakistan (which the US happens to be stepping up aggression towards). </p>

<p>I always like to think what the map of the Middle East may look like after the next war. There&#39;s certainly no saying which way it&#39;ll go, but it&#39;s very interesting to think about what each different side would like to see happen to the map. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Just google it, it&#39;s about a supposed message threat that day that used the not-widely-known code name for Air Force 0ne, implying some inside actors. Like many details from that day events, it&#39;s hard to vouch for its&#39; validity. </p>

<p>As for N0RAD, what&#39;s suspicious is the number of emergency drills scheduled for that day, with scenarios very similar to the attacks. If we take as fact that external agents plotted the whole event, then they must have had an insider, a mole somewhere, and so far, that hasn&#39;t even been hinted at on the official reports.</p>

The King David Hotel bombers (Lehi/Irgun) <em>announced their intent</em> a few days before the bombing and took credit for it afterwords. And the <em>USS Liberty</em> was a friendly fire incident.

    <div class="md"><p>A false flag operation means pinning the blame on someone else. In the examples that you gave, only one was a false flag.</p>

<p>They were dressed as Arabs in the King David hotel not to put the blame on Arabs, but so that they could sneak in. They took full credit for the bombing as soon as it happened, and even warned them days before about what they were planning to do. Not once was an attempt made to pin the bombing on Arabs. Not a false flag. (not to mention the fact that this was the Irgun/Lehi that executed the attack. They were a separate organization that had nothing to do with the groups that eventually became the Israeli government)</p>

<p>The Lavon affair <em>was</em> a false flag attack, that I&#39;ll give you.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not debating the circumstances of the USS Liberty and who you have spoken with and how many websites about it there are, I&#39;m debating whether or not it was a false flag operation. Now, considering that it was patently obvious that the it was Israeli planes, with Israeli markings that attacked the USS Liberty, and how Israel took the blame for it right away and sent ships to pick up the survivors, I don&#39;t think that they were trying to blame Egypt.</p>

<p>What you are saying is because 50 years ago, you believe that Israel deliberately attacked the US, they did 9/11?</p>

<p>In 1946 they dressed as Palestinians and bombed a hotel. Not a military base but a hotel! </p>

<p>In 1954 they bombed the US embassy!</p>

<p>In 1967 they attacked a US flagged naval vessel killing dozens of sailors. </p>

<p>This shouldn&#39;t be a discussion of theories of whether or not there was a plane at the Pentagon or if it was a missile. The government won&#39;t release the videos and there&#39;s nothing we can do about that. However, there are actual names that can be looked up. Not Mohammed Atta. Research Dominic Suter and his company, Urban Moving Systems. </p>

<p>DOMINIC SUTER IS ONE OF THE BIGGEST PIECES OF EVIDENCE WE HAVE LINKING ISRAEL TO 9/11. AND HE&#39;S BACK IN THE COUNTRY AS WE SPEAK!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If these supposed conspirators had wanted to enact draconian security measures and engage in foreign wars, they could&#39;ve more easily caused destruction on a far lesser scale and still blamed Al-Queda. The sheer scale of the 9/11 attacks and the lasting economic impact, as well as the science debunking conspiracy theories, leave me to believe 9/11 wasn&#39;t an inside job.</p>

<p>Now, if you were to say that perhaps there were elements within the government that knew of the terrorist plot and allowed it to unfold, then perhaps I&#39;d be inclined to at least see that as a reasonable conspiracy theory.</p>

<p>I still find it hilarious, though, that people continue to discuss 9/11 as a conspiracy when there was an obvious and proven and more recent conspiracy that threw us into war with Iraq. WMD, you say?</p>

<p>My problem with truthers, and I hope truthers see this and think about what I&#39;m saying, is that the controlled demolition theory has been shown to be invalid ad nauseum. I always wondered why truthers didn&#39;t just argue the government hired people to hijack planes. Wouldn&#39;t that have been easier to accomplish than months of wiring explosives in secret, with less chance of being caught? You basically hand off an untraceable wad of cash somewhere and the deal&#39;s done.</p>

<p>No, the truthers have to go &quot;crazy mode&quot; and come up with outlandish theories about space lasers and mini nukes and remote controlled planes etc etc. It just doesn&#39;t make sense.</p>

<p>Now I don&#39;t think the government executed the attacks at any level. I&#39;m just saying that of the available scenarios, why did the truthers pick the crazy one to latch on to?</p>

<p>The fact is, the CIA discussed this and was also directly involved with the Bay of Pigs.</p>

<p>Oh yeah, and the Gulf of Tonkin incident, you know, the incident that started the Vietnam war, actually never happened.</p>

<p>In 2005, an internal National Security Agency historical study was declassified; it concluded[7] that the Maddox had engaged the North Vietnamese Navy on August 2, but that there may not have been any North Vietnamese Naval vessels present during the incident of August 4. The report stated:</p>

<pre><code>[I]t is not simply that there is a different story as to what happened; it is that no attack happened that night. [...] In truth, Hanoi&#39;s navy was engaged in nothing that night but the salvage of two of the boats damaged on August 2.[8]

<p>Nope, their petition is for a new investigation. They did not get added to that list because of the controlled demolition nonsense.

<p>Exactly. No documentation to show something like what you describe happened has surfaced, which is especially questionable after the Wikileaks uh leaks (awkward to say Wikileaks leaks).</p>

<p>Ok so I&#39;ll grant you that the government doing it in the past is not a good sign, but that <em>isn&#39;t proof of it happening here</em>. </p>

<p>What if you had a speeding ticket 40 years ago, and a cop pulled you over, and didn&#39;t have to prove today you were speeding, he just said that you did it 40 years ago so obviously you are capable of comitting the crime now. Or to make it even more relevant, what if your grandfather got a speeding ticket 40 years ago, and you got a speeding ticket today because of it? It&#39;s the same standard of proof.</p>

<p>I <em>don&#39;t</em> believe everything the government says. I am also not looking for a conspiracy wherever I can find one.</p>

<p>True, because they don&#39;t believe the story given in the official report.  Actually, there was no story at all about building 7 in the official report.</p>

<p>No, they take the stance that 90% of us take: that the official story doesn&#39;t seem to add up, especially since firemen, and the owner of the insurance policy for WTF, are on record saying that building 7 was pulled.</p>

<p>Are you denying that&#39;s the case?</p>

<p>False equivalence.  The survey wasn&#39;t about whether or not the Germans knew of 9/11&#39;s existence, it was whether or not they believed the official story.  It wasn&#39;t a survey about knowledge, as your 3 branches survey was, it was a survey about belief. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>but that isn&#39;t proof of it happening here.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Again, twisting words.  I never said it was proof that they&#39;re doing it here.  I&#39;m pointing out that such operations have been discussed at an extremely high level in the past. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>What if you had a speeding ticket 40 years ago, and a cop pulled you over, and didn&#39;t have to prove today you were speeding, he just said that you did it 40 years ago so obviously you are capable of comitting the crime now.</p>

<p>In court, discussing a person&#39;s previous criminal history is used both by the prosecution to establish the character of the defendant, is it not?  The judge also uses this information when dishing out sentences, i.e., repeat offenders generally get harsher punishments.  </p>

<p>Basically there is an endless stream of evidence pointing to at the very least, complicity. You don&#39;t need to believe in controlled demolition, remote controlled planes or anything of the sort to have serious doubts about the legitimacy of the official story. Keep in mind that knowing the official story is a fraud =/= knowing exact details about how it was carried out. </p>

<p>This is important. Much like people love for you to think you&#39;re either a liberal or a conservative, pro-life or pro-choice, etc., they love for you to think that you&#39;re either on the government&#39;s side or you&#39;re a conspiracy theorist. This simply isn&#39;t true. </p>

<p>The facts point toward a reality that is different from what the 9/11 Commission presented as the truth. There are heaps of evidence that something we don&#39;t fully understand took place. However, just because a certain party is wrong or presenting false information does not make them automatically complicit in the attacks or a large-scale coverup.</p>

<p>The fact of the matter is that no one (other than any responsible and/or involved parties) knows what really happened, or why, but we do deserve an answer considering the actions taken by our government based on the incident. There is no doubt that, even if it was not directly responsible, the American government took great advantage of 9/11 to push its otherwise fucked up agenda forward. </p>

<p>Personally, I think the reason the government doesn&#39;t want us to know more about 9/11 is because they&#39;re still using it as an excuse to kill people in the middle east every day. If they could&#39;ve pulled off telling us there were WMDs in Iraq indefinitely, they would&#39;ve. Their concern is selling immorality under the guise of justice (and let&#39;s not limit this to the government - how many bigots claim 9/11 as the reason for their racism, xenophobia, violence, and overall ignorance?). Just because 9/11 is an excuse and justification for horrific actions doesn&#39;t mean it was planned to be those things - people are opportunists.</p>

<p>This is why we <em>do</em> need to know the truth, though. So that no one may kill anyone else and rationalize it via a tragedy, basically.</p>

<p>A few years ago, the FBI released a <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=paWiZ2Y8fRg&amp;amp;feature=related">few seconds of two videos</a>, although neither of them show a plane hitting the building.</p>

<p>Furthermore, the FBI, nearly ten years after &quot;fact&quot;, <em>still</em> refuses to release any footage from <a href="http://infowars.net/articles/may2006/170506Pentagon_videos.htm">any of the 84 remaining surveillance tapes</a> </p>

<p>Both the co-chairs of the commission said the commission was &quot;set up to fail&quot;: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tzrv-e37Es8">Kean</a> <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnANe7w8pmY">Hamilton</a></p>

<p>Some sort of unusual oxidation and sulfidation going on with the steel. <a href="http://911research.wtc7.net/wtc/evidence/metallurgy/WTC_apndxC.htm">These photos</a> are really good evidence of that. No one has offered an explanation for this.

<p>The military has been using thermite since 1991 to collapse vertical structures. &lt;<a href="http://blog.dreamslaughter.com/2009/09/slow-burn.html">source</a>&gt;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I majored in Mechanical Engineering. I was at home when the first tower came down. I remember thinking, &quot;That&#39;s impossible!&quot; But I had just seen it with my own two eyes.</p>

<p>Years later, &quot;Loose Change.&quot; And it confirmed what was my instinct. Imagine that you&#39;re in park at a red light, and a car rear-ends you at about 10 mph, and both cars blow up and everyone dies. Seems like something else happened, right? Well, as an ME, that&#39;s exactly how it seemed to me. I would like to say that I am exaggerating, but I&#39;m not. Neither of those towers should have collapsed. I don&#39;t know much about building 7, or I&#39;d say &quot;None of those 3 buildings&quot;.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve known about false-flag ops for some time. They&#39;ve been around for a while. I read a ton of books about politics and political families and I know nothing happens by accident. (Very few things actually happen by accident).</p>

<p>For instance, apparently Yasser Arafat leaned over to Carter and asked him if he knew that Bill Casey and George Bush asked the Iranians to keep the hostages until after the election. (Reference: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/American-Dynasty-Aristocracy-Fortune-Politics/dp/0143034316/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;amp;ie=UTF8&amp;amp;qid=1296050762&amp;amp;sr=1-1">here</a>). Just think about that for a minute. You&#39;re willing to leave Americans in a bind for an election. That&#39;s cold, man. </p>

<p>Well, IMO, Americans (the govt anyway) have passed every such barrier. They&#39;re capable of anything now. Nothing&#39;s &quot;cold&quot; to them anymore.</p>

<p>The media is not the tip of the iceberg. The media is a 2-d black and white photograph of that tip on a cloudy day. This ... ability to think freely ... is something that I was born with, so far as I can tell. I don&#39;t judge people who believe mainstream media, I really don&#39;t. Because I know why they want to believe that everything is A-OK. </p>

<p>All you really need is to be willing to think about things. To not be afraid of looking under a rock, just because there may be some nasty critter there (there is). Don&#39;t be afraid of the truth.</p>

<p>Also, I want to say that the 9/11 conspiracy is fairly tame. What I mean is that if you can&#39;t accept the evidence for the conspiracy (which is straightforward), then I&#39;m not going to talk to you about space weapons.</p>

<p>When I&#39;m researching something I take both sides into account, which is what a lot of people here fail to do, yet they always seem so smug in calling someone a &quot;sheep&quot; whos &quot;under the medias influence&quot;.</p>

<p>Hypocrites.</p>

<p>Anyway to your original post, I&#39;ll keep it quick as I only have 10 mins left on my dinner.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I would like to say that I am exaggerating, but I&#39;m not. Neither of those towers should have collapsed</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Please explain your reasoning behind this, (I.e. technically, you say you&#39;re a mechanical engineer major so the discussion of the forces involved would be interesting)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I&#39;ve known about false-flag ops for some time. They&#39;ve been around for a while. I read a ton of books about politics and political families and I know nothing happens by accident.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Quite objective. I can&#39;t claim to know but I&#39;d imagine the books you&#39;ve read are from one point of view (quite similar to how I mentioned Maintream vs. Alt media only showing one side). If you buy a book about flase flag operations then it&#39;s pretty obvious the author will have a bias leaning towards that fact.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>For instance, apparently Yasser Arafat leaned over to Carter and asked him if he knew that Bill Casey and George Bush asked the Iranians to keep the hostages until after the election. (Reference: here). Just think about that for a minute. You&#39;re willing to leave Americans in a bind for an election. That&#39;s cold, man.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Dark, but irrelevant. &quot;apparantly&quot; implies that this might just be conjecture. I&#39;d be interested in seeing your sources for this (bearing in mind what I said earlier)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Well, IMO, Americans (the govt anyway) have passed every such barrier. They&#39;re capable of anything now. Nothing&#39;s &quot;cold&quot; to them anymore.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Again, opinion.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>All you really need is to be willing to think about things. To not be afraid of looking under a rock, just because there may be some nasty critter there (there is). Don&#39;t be afraid of the truth.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And don&#39;t be afraid of the truth not being what you want to believe. I&#39;m not. If there was solid evidence that made sense, rather than conjecture and circumstantial evidence that is presented as conclusive.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Also, I want to say that the 9/11 conspiracy is fairly tame. What I mean is that if you can&#39;t accept the evidence for the conspiracy (which is straightforward), then I&#39;m not going to talk to you about space weapons.</p>

<p>Which evidence are you referring to?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No worries, it&#39;s the internet. Misunderstandings happen.</p>

<p>Yeah, if you&#39;re looking for truth, you have to recognize bias where you see it. No arguments there.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t call people sheep. I will say it jokingly sometimes. &quot;You&#39;re asleep in the matrix, man.&quot; But as a Christian, I can&#39;t judge people by a different standard than I use on myself. And in many ways, I&#39;m a sound sleeper also.</p>

<p>Regarding your inquiry, I have to say &quot;as an engineering <em>major</em>&quot; because I&#39;m a computer programmer. I never worked as an engineer. So my answer&#39;s not going to be as interesting as you&#39;d hoped.</p>

<p>When the towers came down I thought it was impossible because nothing really should have collapsed, just weakened. Buildings aren&#39;t made to withstand plane collisions (though now they may be), but they are made to withstand fire and heavy winds, even heavy oscillating winds. If you think of a single tower as a lever arm, the impact of a plane at the top is going to put a lot of very sudden force at the base. The same base that is made to support the weight of the entire structure.</p>

<p>Concrete has severe compressive strength. But no tensile strength. Which is why they reinforce it with iron, or steel. Usually steel. The steel allows tensile strength to reinforced concrete. </p>

<p>Now this is where my instincts kicked in. When you&#39;re rock climbing, you&#39;re using woven nylon. Let&#39;s say you weigh 200 lbs. Well, fuck, the woven nylon has a 2 ton rating. It&#39;s overkill. That nylon would support a small truck. What would it take to duplicate a truck&#39;s sudden impact on the nylon? Well, dropping the truck from the top of the rock. In all honesty, depending on the size of the truck, I don&#39;t think the woven nylon would snap. Though I could be wrong. I&#39;m actually not much of a climber anymore. But my point is that this overkill is very common in engineering.</p>

<p>The force required to do something is basically not a scenario. Let&#39;s assume the opposite to resume the discussion.</p>

<p>The tower then should have collapsed into the base. This is what I was expecting to see. What I saw was that it collapsed from the top down. There was some discussion about the heat of jet fuel, but this is (IMO) nonsense. Complete nonsense. That steel was forged and quenched at much higher temperatures. It&#39;s been a while since I was in school, but the softening of the girders made no sense to me. So you&#39;re saying that the fuel was aerated enough to burn but not to cool? Bollocks! Even if it were, it wouldn&#39;t soften naked girders.</p>

<p>Finally, you have the collapse. Even if we assumed that I was in the wrong about the softening of the girders, the top of the building would collapse and fall off. They aren&#39;t dominoes. Each floor is made to withstand the weight of the floors above it. So am I to believe that the collapse created such dynamic weight that the other floors are going to collapse too?</p>

<p>The overkill in the calculations of materials and strengths are such that you can fill the floors in with concrete and be okay. This is why no one cares how many people are in the buildings, or what they put in the buildings themselves, because they don&#39;t need to. So even if the heat made the upper floors collapse, you&#39;d be left with 3/4 of a tower.</p>

<p>This overkill is why they build skyscrapers in the first place. If the calculations were &quot;close&quot;, they wouldn&#39;t.</p>

<p>My source was American Dynasty by Kevin Phillips (I think that&#39;s his name). Regarding the Iranians.</p>

<p>You&#39;re having trouble with the 9/11 conspiracy, &quot;I&#39;m not going to talk to you about space weapons&quot; (wink), but if you ready further down, I end up talking about them anyway. I gotta go. Am at work.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sorry for the late reply, been hectic recently and I haven&#39;t had chance to sit down and write a proper reply.</p>

<p>I agree about the misunderstandings, unfortunately it&#39;s more often than not idiots - it&#39;s refreshing to see I was wrong about you.</p>

<p>I thought you meant an actually in the engineer field but it&#39;s still awesome having a majors in engineering, respect for that.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>No disagreements here.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>I agree about the overkill - it&#39;s always better to err on the site of caution, especially in construction and planning. What you&#39;re saying about replicating the impact by dropping shows good <em>(Fuck, can&#39;t think of the appropriate word - Workaround-ing?)</em> skills which I find is a great way of dealing with problems like what you described with dropping the truck. </p>

<p>I suppose an apt scenario would be if the truck caught fire after being dropped. Say the nylon was coated with fireproofing material, <em>(I&#39;ve never been a climber, can you get fire-proof ropes?)</em> maybe it could hold for a length of time. The stress of the hanging truck (loosely relating to the structural damage from having a plane inside a building) in combination with the fire might be enough to make the rope snap.</p>

<p>Obviously claiming that proves the 9/11 situation would be silly, but I suppose it&#39;s a fairly close example as to how extreme circumstances can affect properties of things.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>I love your thinking style. I really do.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Quite a good argument, I suppose it rests on the claim that steel loses x% of its structural integrity at x Degrees. Care to discuss this at all? (although prolly not best on a week old reddit thread heh) </p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>This comes back to a static vs. dynamic load I guess, or something along them lines. I think the hardest floor to go would be the first one that gave way, as it would&#39;ve had the least dynamic force of each of the collapses (assuming a consecutive collapse of Floor 80 onto 79, 80+79 onto 78 etc...).</p>

<p>Each floor would have more dynamic load than the previous floor did - I think the difference in dynamic and static forces explains why even though each floor descending would&#39;ve been built to withstand more force than the one before.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve burnt my head out (long day at work). I&#39;ll finish this reply tomorrow before I BSOD my brain.</p>

<p>The 50th floor would have to support a force of:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>F=Ma
Force = Mass * Acceleration
Force = X *</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yep. I agree with all of it. I am trying to remember how concrete behaves under dynamic load ... but drawing a blank.</p>

<p>I think the biggest point about the 9/11 conspiracy (and conspiracies in general) is always missed. And that is we&#39;re not playing on the same team anymore.</p>

<p>I remember when POW&#39;s was a &#39;conspiracy theory&#39;. The government said they didn&#39;t leave anyone in Vietnam unless they were MIA&#39;s, KIA&#39;s, etc.  I think in 2004 there were still 400 POW&#39;s, only they had integrated into Vietnam society. They settled down in Vietnam, unable apparently to forgive their country for having left them.</p>

<p>I think that was the beginning of a splintering in America. You had people who wanted to be good, be ethical, here and abroad, and you had people who wanted whatever they wanted, damn it, and didn&#39;t want anyone thinking too much about it. Just action. War, in short. When you start breaking these important rules, such as never leave a man behind, it opens you up to anything, ethically. </p>

<p>I find it really interesting that it&#39;s so terrestrial, the 9/11 thing. I mean, it&#39;s not &quot;Did we land on the moon?&quot; where it&#39;s harder to get evidence. It&#39;s New York, only a few miles away for many many people.</p>

<p>The one that I thought about the most, that came from this thread actually, was the person filming the first plane crash. Just think about this. New York, skyscrapers, low visibility. Someone is camcording or cell-phone recording a narrow window of the world trade center at 8:15 am.?</p>

<p>What was he doing, filming his dog pooping and ... whoa! what&#39;s that in the background a plane hitting WTC One?</p>

<p>That makes me think that people knew about it. Well, it was <em>patently</em> a conspiracy anyway, based on the conspirator&#39;s plan, but the guy who filmed the first plane was expecting it, and this makes me think that a lot of other people knew and allowed it to happen.</p>

<p>Trust is gone in the USA.</p>

<p>EDIT: I tried to find the footage of the first plane, and I think my theory needs some work ;)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>People have an illusion about incontrovertible evidence. Clearly, no evidence is or can be incontrovertible, because anything can be denied. If I had one wish, people would understand that we see what we want to believe. I would say that over and over again. Science doesn&#39;t really change that, because people interpret the results anyway they want to. (Global warming, anyone?)</p>

<p>So I try to avoid discussions with people who believe that scientists are objective, or that science exists without scientists, as an abstract ideal.</p>

<p>I would be interested in reading Purdue&#39;s study. Is <a href="http://www.purdue.edu/uns/x/2007a/070612HoffmannWTC.html">this</a> what you&#39;re referring to?</p>

<p>Well, I don&#39;t know about space weapons. It&#39;s something that you see referred to in the literature from time to time, but like a lot of other things, until it comes from official channels, it won&#39;t be believed. I first heard about it from Noam Chomsky, then I wrote an email to Thomas PM Bartnett (<a href="http://globlogization.wikistrat.com/">his blog</a>), and he said, and I quote &quot;By and large, Chomsky is full of shit.&quot;</p>

<p>He worked for the Pentagon as a middle-ranking guy for a long time, and he (apparently) never heard of any space weapons. </p>

<p>So either 1) they exist and they&#39;re a well-kept secret or 2) they just don&#39;t exist.</p>

<p>You remember star wars (Reagan) and the Columbia disaster. Some think that the shuttle was carrying a missile payload that detonated. Like all conspiracy theories, it needs evidence. That Feynman was able to explain the disaster in terms of cold O-rings speaks to me more about possibilities and less about truth. (And I&#39;m sure it&#39;s going to be the same when I get around to reading that Purdue study.)</p>

<p>Some say we never landed on the moon. But some others say that we did, but were chased off. By ET&#39;s. Some of this subset say that weapons in space are following a &quot;plan.&quot; 1) Russians 2) Dictators 3) Terrorists 4) ET&#39;s. Star Wars would have been step # 1, for instance.</p>

<p>Now, anyone can plainly see that weapons in space would be ideal from a military perspective. Understanding the military-industrial complex (that it <em>needs</em> war to further itself), I am comfortable <em>assuming</em> that there are weapons in space.</p>

<p>This may sound strange to some, but remember that Eisenhower warned us of the complex in &#39;54 (farewell speech to the union), and look at what&#39;s happened since then. A false flag (Gulf of Tonkin) got us into &#39;nam. Skirmishes here and there. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=22YnJxDFUQE">Here</a> is part 1 of 12 about our activities in Panama, which clearly paves the way to a future type of war, involving PsyOps. It&#39;s worth your time. And it fills in a couple of &quot;blanks&quot; between Nam and Iraq. </p>

<p>Interestingly, there&#39;s a part in that documentary about future weapons. Some Nicaraguans said that cars were melted, cut in half. I think there was a mention of a green laser, but I would have to go back and listen to it. It doesn&#39;t speak so much about space, but about the Military Industrial Complex&#39;s need for war to develop and prosper.</p>

<p>Space has obvious appeal. Deploy anywhere in the world in minutes. Afghanistan featured a high level of satellite technology in deployment. In October 2001. It worked like fucking gangbusters.</p>

<p>So there are a lot of evidence &#39;gaps&#39; and holes when I say &quot;there are weapons in space&quot;. Some NASA people have come forward and said that there are aliens, this and that, bases on the moon, UFO&#39;s, but until NASA itself says it, people aren&#39;t going to believe them. People see what they want to believe. I think if you&#39;re an astronaut, you&#39;re pretty damn credible. But never underestimate people&#39;s willingness to create illusions.</p>

<p>Nixon has some things about NASA classified until 2026. I think there are probably going to come to light some things before 2050 or 2060 that will make it clear that there were weapons in space for a while, even pointed at our allies from time to time (who our &quot;allies&quot; are changes with the wind). But all of this is based on putting things together from literature. It&#39;s a long process, and I don&#39;t mind being proven wrong, but like I said, I just know these guys. They think in terms of war. It&#39;s how they see the world.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>“People have an illusion about incontrovertible evidence.”</p>

<p>I think there is much truth to what you said, which is why we need to rely on collective wisdom. There will always be outliers, but when those in the know tend to support a given conclusion, that conclusion is 
most likely to be the correct one.</p>

<p>“So I try to avoid discussions with people who believe that scientists are objective, or that science exists without scientists, as an abstract ideal.”</p>

<p>I also agree with that statement.</p>

<p>“I would be interested in reading Purdue&#39;s study. Is this what you&#39;re referring to?”</p>

<p>Yes. I have the actual report around here somewhere. It’s dry and highly technical. Which is good.</p>

<p>Do you mean Challenger? I was at NASA when Columbia happened. There was nothing nefarious about Columbia. Challenger really is pretty cut and dry. </p>

<p>“So there are a lot of evidence gaps and wholes. Some NASA people have come forward and said that there are aliens, this and that, bases on the moon, UFO&#39;s, but until NASA itself says it, people aren&#39;t going to believe them. People see what they want to believe.”</p>

<p>But there have been dozens, I think. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szBc4bDx-fk">Musgrave</a> comes up a lot. Sorry the link is in spanish.</p>

<p>I like the fact that now there are other space agencies. I was disappointed when I looked for the Kaguya footage ... only to find that it had been manipulated by NASA via software. Hopefully every country will get into space and we can start getting lots and lots of data.</p>

<p>Unless it was tin or lead it would have to be over 1000f. Even Aluminum requires 1200f to melt. <a href="http://www.engineeringtoolbox.com/melting-temperature-metals-d_860.html">source</a></p>

<p>Having temperatures of at least 1000f 6-8 weeks after the event tells me things were much much hotter the day of. <a href="http://www.ugrad.math.ubc.ca/coursedoc/math100/notes/diffeqs/cool.html">Newtons Law of Cooling</a></p>

<p>Considering that there is actual evidence of <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WWAnCd_6lg">melted iron and carbon steel</a> the temperature must have reached at least 2700f at some point.   </p>

<p>Considering kerosene burns at roughly 1500f, add carpet, furniture, paper etc. and you still only get to 2000f.</p>

<p>Now Im not going to jump to a conclusion or speculate what i think is the cause is, but there are research papers that have come forth in Europe that state termite compounds were found in samples of dust collected over the course of the event. <a href="http://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/archivos_pdf/activethermitic_911.pdf">here is one of them</a>  </p>

<p>It&#39;s probably one of the few times that a flight recorder was fired in to the top of a very large building and then collapsed in to a heap though too. Ie unusually hard to find, unusual potential for ongoing heat beyond just the aircraft fuel burn. </p>

<p>But having said that, they found a lot of other stuff apparently, so maybe both recorders are in George Tenet&#39;s pool room or something. </p>

<p>The fact is, the CIA discussed this and was also directly involved with the Bay of Pigs.</p>

<p>Oh yeah, and the Gulf of Tonkin incident, you know, the incident that started the Vietnam war, actually never happened.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In 2005, an internal National Security Agency historical study was declassified; it concluded[7] that the Maddox had engaged the North Vietnamese Navy on August 2, but that there may not have been any North Vietnamese Naval vessels present during the incident of August 4. The report stated:</p>

<p>[I]t is not simply that there is a different story as to what happened; it is that no attack happened that night. [...] In truth, Hanoi&#39;s navy was engaged in nothing that night but the salvage of two of the boats damaged on August 2.[8]</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I thought a lot about this. </p>

<p>It might be hard for you to watch, but take a look of the videos of both collapses. Both initial collapses start right at the points of impact(the holes). In some of the tower 2 videos (south), you can see the upper floors remain intact as they fall.  Not until it passes the point of impact does the top of the tower get obscured. </p>

<p>The first tower (north)was hit much higher up. </p>

<p>This is the key to why this tower had ejected material further out. </p>

<p>Both towers when they collapsed had upper sections intact as they collapsed through the lower floors, but the North Tower (wtc1) this collapse initiated HIGHER then the South Tower and therefore the ejected mushroom cloud effect of debris ejected further out. The weight of the upper mass of floors ejected the material outwards. The initial point of collapse was higher, so material fell from a greater height and was ejected out further then the south tower.</p>

<p>WTC 7 is definitely anomolous, but the evidence supporting nefarious intent is weak in my eyes. Why? Better explanations, such that WTC 7 straddled a substation and had a very atypical (read: less than ideal) design, and the massive fire that burned for hours (<a href="http://i.imgur.com/9nJ9J.jpg">http://i.imgur.com/9nJ9J.jpg</a>) compounded the significant structural damage, seems an explanation that better fits.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>To make an argument that someone other than those flying the planes was involved in 9/11, I think Building 7 is the smoking gun. Forget about missing Pentagon videos, Operation Northwoods or even the theory of controlled demolition of the first two buildings - all of this is based on circumstantial evidence and for every item supporting these theories there is an equally valid counter-argument. You could debate these theories for years and never prove one side or the other.</p>

<p>However, there are a few facts about Building 7 that, in my opinion, show that something is wrong with the official story. First, Building 7 was not hit by a plane and was across the street from all of the other WTC buildings, yet still collapsed. The official reason for this was fire, yet there was a relatively small fire compared to other buildings that didn&#39;t collapse (Building 6 was located between No. 7 and 1, engulfed in flames and hit by debris of both towers falling but didn&#39;t collapse) making it the only steel-frame skyscraper EVER to collapse solely because of fire. This building was also in between two other large buildings that were also on fire but only sustained moderate damage and are still standing. </p>

<p>Furthermore, Building 7 was not mentioned AT ALL in the 9/11 Report. In fact, it took several more years for the federal government to finally acknowledge Building 7 in an official report. This was a building that was the third largest of the complex and would&#39;ve been the tallest building in 33 states, and it didn&#39;t even get a sentence about it in the government&#39;s &quot;comprehensive investigation.&quot;</p>

<p>Now, I&#39;m not saying that 9/11 was an inside job, or even that the government played a part in the collapse of Building 7. I&#39;m not hypothesizing about why this building collapsed or who was the cause. What I am saying is that this part of the story doesn&#39;t fit in with the rest and that a more thorough investigation is needed. </p>

<p>Fox News did a great report on Israeli spying before and on 9/11. Granted, this report does say that there is no evidence linking the Israelis to 9/11, but this will give you some good background knowledge of the operations in place to make this happen.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JWpWc_suPWo">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JWpWc_suPWo</a></p>

<p>Then you have articles and police interviews regarding Israelis arrested &quot;dancing and cheering&quot; across the Hudson River in NJ on 9/11. The September 12, 2001 edition of The Bergen Record (NJ newspaper) has a great article about this. It was never discussed again. I personally own the hard copy of this article and can confirm that it has been transcribed correctly. </p>

<p><a href="http://whatreallyhappened.com/WRHARTICLES/fiveisraelis.html">http://whatreallyhappened.com/WRHARTICLES/fiveisraelis.html</a></p>

<p>Then you have one man in particular who was arrested that day. He had a moving company and warehouse in NJ that were left completely abandoned when he fled to Israel following his arrest. This man was linked to the Zoomcopter ring centered in New Jersey malls. These malls acted as a way to funnel spies and explosive experts into the USA undetected. </p>

<p>This man is now back in the US, using the same name, and operates a business linked to the vast Israeli locksmith ring. If you have the time, look into that. </p>

<p>Several of the Israelis who were arrested that day were on an Israeli talkshow and made it very clear that they were not responsible for the attacks. They told the audience that their purpose that day was &quot;to document the events&quot;. Well that settles any debate on Israeli foreknowledge. But to the more important question, were the actually involved?</p>

<p>You have the story of Daniel Lewin on the plane and one account saying he had a gun. He was left out of some of the passenger lists, but on his company website was touted as a hero. He also has a very interesting history with the Israeli military and was conveniently omitted from several passenger lists published on 9-12 in the media. </p>

<p>If you look into details surrounding the agents arrested, you will see that several were explosives experts. </p>

But to believe that 9/11 happened according to the official story is ludicrous - there are massive gaping holes in that argument that one has to conveniently ignore in order to accept the official story.</p>

<li>The fact that an official investigation was fought tooth and nail and hampered once finally &quot;a committe&quot; was set up that then omitted most of the important issues. In fact Dick Cheney made the ridiculous claim that they shouldn´t waste time on it as they should instead be focusing on preventing new attacks. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint_Inquiry_into_Intelligence_Community_Activities_before_and_after_the_Terrorist_Attacks_of_September_11,_2001">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint_Inquiry_into_Intelligence_Community_Activities_before_and_after_the_Terrorist_Attacks_of_September_11,_2001</a></li>
</ol>

<p>How stupid is that? If you´re a basketball coach and your team plays a game where the defence is letting everyone through and not getting any rebounds, would you ever make the claim that you didn´t want to study the game in question to find out what went wrong? Who was playing particularly bad and what areas you needed to focus on improving? Absolutely ridicilous.</p>

<ol>
<li>Insider trading that was never investigated, that is people gaining money from knowing what was going to happen.</li>

<p>Most of the alleged hijackers had been tracked for a long time by the Defanse Department in this program, Mohammed Atta from 2005. All the documents on it was then destroyed... Even Fox News reported on this eventually: <a href="http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2010/10/04/exclusive-witnesses-defense-department-report-suggest-cover-findings/">http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2010/10/04/exclusive-witnesses-defense-department-report-suggest-cover-findings/</a></p>

<p>From article: A Pentagon employee was ordered to destroy documents that identified Mohamed Atta as a terrorist two years before the 2001 attacks, a congressman said Thursday.</p>

<p>And like... I have to do things next week so I´m not sure I can continue this right now, I could literally go on for years.</p>

<p>But there is so much more, everywhere you look there is more inconsistencies, blatant lies and ridiculous claims that fly in the face of all logic. </p>

<p>Then there is obviously Operation Northwoods, the military drills designed to deliberately confuse the defense system, building 7 brought down in a controlled demolition, The Bush/Bin Laden family close financial relationship, Pentagon missing 2.3 TRILLIONS on september 10th, multiple warnings before the event from foreign agencies (<a href="http://www.historycommons.org/essay.jsp?article=essaytheytriedtowarnus">http://www.historycommons.org/essay.jsp?article=essaytheytriedtowarnus</a> - If all these foreign intelligence agencies could smell something was up, how come the CIA didn´t? And why having had all these warnings, some even very specific, such as the August 6 memo titled Bin Laden determined to strike in the US and mentioned hijacking aircraft, why did the Bush administration feign ignorance about the nature of the first plane hitting the tower? Why, at the very least, were the people in the second tower told to keep working and not at least told that there were warnings of this nature??)... also google project for a new american century and their report &quot;rebuilding americas defences&quot; from september 2000 for a clear picture on who had motive to do something like this</p>

<p>I may continue this later, breakfast is due. Please watch one of the many detailed documentaries on this issue. Who benefitted? War mongers benefitted. </p>

<p>You will find beyond any reasonable doubt that we were lied to.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The &quot;truth&quot; of 9/11 will debated endlessly as there are as many forces arrayed against discovering it as there are trying to find it. That alone speaks volumes as to where the truth might be hiding. </p>

<p>There are basically two camps that wrestle over what &quot;the truth&quot; is.  One camp decides they wish to believe the Commission and will accept remotely plausible explanations of what the other camp sees as a stonewalling investigation, glaring inconsistencies, coincidences too odd, physics manifesting itself in ways so rare and unusual that the explanations offered are contested by legions of highly qualified professionals, and a requisite confluence of events beyond the bounds of reasonable probability of coming together necessary to allow it to occur.</p>

<p>The former camp sees those same set of rare oddities and decides, with help from the government, that it all jibes, is all tied up in neat package, and tries to cast out disbelievers, not as healthy skeptics, but as tin foil hatted lunatics trying to tear down the government. The latter group looks at those same oddities and says, &quot;I smell a rat. Let&#39;s keep looking at this&quot;. I would think the casual observer would agree the latter group has the more forthright agenda.</p>

<p>As I&#39;ve said few other times,  I don&#39;t believe the government, as we know to be, was responsible. But I do believe there had to be some people in key positions to allow this to happen and with enough clout to scare anyone else who knew into stone silence.  </p>

<p>That&#39;s actually not true, at all.  At least in computer science, a significant portion of funding comes from HP Labs, Google Labs, Microsoft Research, Intel Labs, IBM, etc.  They fund significant research projects in academia. </p>

Their whole premise is that architects and engineers should know better than anyone and support them disproportionately. Yet they&#39;ve only got 1400 signatories out of millions. They think this vindicates their views, while it actually only underscores their delusion.</p>

<p>There is insufficient evidence that 9/11 was an inside job, and you are too lazy to even <em>try</em> defending your position.</p>

Cruising speed of a 757 is about 500 mph, give or take a few, and Shanksville, PA is 267 miles from New York, making the flight time from Shanksville to New York about half and hour. The South Tower collapsed at 9:59, while the North collapsed at 10:28. Flight 93 crashed at 10:03. However, if it hadn&#39;t it would have arrived in New York, on the right flight path and at the perfect time to fly right over the two collapsed towers and into WTC7.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, if you believe the official account is true, I would recommend you study the official account in detail. I&#39;ve read the 9/11 commissions report, and it&#39;s nicely written, it reads like a Tom Clancy novel (sorry Tom). What immediately catches your eye, is that there are a whole array of axioms on which it&#39;s conclusions rest. For one, they never even question that the 20 or so terrorists did it. </p>

<p>Now, I&#39;m not a professional investigator, but I&#39;m pretty sure that what you do, when investigating a crime, is to consider all possibilities and let the evidence speak for itself. Motive is important, but physical evidence is even more important.</p>

<p>If the official account is true, then there are a lot of issues that still need to be explained in order to support its conclusions.</p>

<p>Maybe you&#39;re asking the wrong question. Perhaps the right question is: What exactly makes me trust the official account?</p>

<p>That it comes from authority?</p>

<p>That any other explanation would require us to entertain some uncomfortable possibilities?</p>

<p>Or is it really the evidence?</p>

<p>Personally I&#39;ve found it impossible to believe the official account once I looked at what it actually entailed in terms of incredible coincidence upon coincidence. </p>

<p>Ask yourself: Where does the knowledge, you think you have come from, and upon what evidence does it rest?</p>

<p>Connect the dots, look at everything which has been put into place because of the events on 9/11.... It doesn&#39;t take a genius to see whats going on. Sure it can be discomforting, but its obvious and its something we will have to deal with sooner than later.</p>

<p>Where do you see society after one more <em>terrorist attack</em>? </p>

<p>There are so many holes in the story reported, that even if only one of them is true, everything must be brought into question.</p>

<p>-WTC 7
-Pentagon footage confiscated.
-Molten Steele
-Nothing left from the plane in Shanksville
-All the insurances placed, and stock options are incredibly sketchy</p>

<p>There is no such thing as &quot;free fall speed&quot;. There is something called terminal velocity, but that&#39;s entirely different.</p>

<p>Free fall is an acceleration, not a speed. It&#39;s roughly 9.81 m/s/s on earth near the ground. The towers did not fall at free fall acceleration. Now that you have the number, you can actually time it yourself and see that your comment is untrue.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is not inconsistent with the rest of the NIST report in any way. The area demolished by the airplanes would have offered much less resistance than the structure below.</p>

<p>Technically, it&#39;s a &quot;near free fall&quot; drop between 1.75s and 4s and the wording should have said as much. Just take the difference of 2.25s at t=1.75s and t=4.0s to determine what the accelerations were at those points. The numbers support that it was not pure free fall.</p>

<p>Besides, all the evidence you need to see that the towers didn&#39;t come down at free-fall acceleration is the fact that debris thrown clear of the buildings actually fell at free fall (terminal velocity if we&#39;re being technical) as physics predicts.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m in a very similar spot to you.  Like many have said, no one will ever really know the truth for 100% certain, except those involved directly.</p>

<p>That being said, I am a very logical person, and examine things from various angles.  The official reports leave too many questions for me, and the official/media story leaves a lot of uneasy feelings of incompleteness for me.  But at the same time, I&#39;m not an engineer, or a demolition expert, so I can&#39;t say how it should/shouldn&#39;t look.  But that being said, one of the things that has never sat right with me is the images from after the collapse (not the ones from after cleanup started).  They show me (in my untrained eye) evidence that supports both sides of the story.</p>

<p>There are LARGE sections of the outer walls standing up from the piles of debris.  If this was a controlled demolition, my mind says that these shouldn&#39;t exist in such large chunks.  But if it was just a building collapsing, with the floors pancaking on the way down, the floors could have separated from the walls in large sections like this.</p>

<p>The other thing is that there seems to be very little twisted/bent steel girders.  Most of the steel girders are straight and look more like the bolts were cut/missing/whatever.  To me (again, not an expert) this would be something I would be more expectant to see in some sort of controlled demolition.  In just a &quot;weakened structure collapse&quot;, my mind is expecting to see a lot more bent/twisted steel girders since the entire bottom half of the towers would have only been crushed by the upper floors (where the fires were and where the weakened steel was).</p>

<p>This is just one thing that makes me wonder.  I can&#39;t say it&#39;s evidence one way or another since this is just how I see this, and how I see it supports/disproves both stories.</p>

<p>Because you started this thread, and seem genuinely open to actual evidence (if someone can show you some), it suggests that you may not fully believe the &quot;official/media story&quot; as well.  No one would start a discussion looking for someone to convince them of another option if they were fully committed to their own opinion.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think that 19 terrorists hijacked four planes and crashed two of them into WTC 1 &amp; 2, one into the Pentagon and one crashed in Pennsylvania. The evidence supports at least that much.</p>

<p>Was the investigation sufficient? I don&#39;t know. I do know that some people will never be satisfied as they bring their preconceived notions to the table and will reject anything that is counter to their presupposition. That goes for both sides.</p>

<p>Was it exploited as a pretext for war? Probably. Had 9/11 never happened, the Iraq war probably would not have happened. If it were a conspiracy, and the conspirators could blame it on anybody they wanted to justify their ends, why not blame it on Saddam Hussein making the connection and justification for war clear?</p>

<p>More than anything, I&#39;m curious as to what it takes to convince people of anything. I am of the opinion that many people who believe the conspiracy are credulous and view the evidence with presupposition that it was an inside job.</p>

<p>This was a COMPLICATED event. Physics and understanding it is HARD. It requires a lot of work. On the other hand, looking at the towers falling and saying, &quot;that looks similar to a controlled demolition&quot; is easy. I think that if most believers took the time to understand the science behind the collapses, they&#39;d change their tune. But again, that requires a lot of hard work.</p>

    <div class="md"><p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6C6uJUzHn0&amp;amp;feature=feedf">There have been many accounts of witness seeing explosions happening</a>. This guy claims to have seen explosions 20 stories or so under the fire. There was also molton steel at ground zero, yet the steel was supposedly just &quot;weakened&quot; to the point of breaking. The fuel couldn&#39;t burn hot enough to melt the steel, yet something else was able to heat it to the point of melting? A janitor, one of the last to leave the site heard series of explosions just before evacuation, yet his testimony was stricken from the report? Bush being handed a document saying that osama was going to attack and he just ignores it? Not a fan of bush, but nobody is that negligent. </p>

<p>You have the most dependable and  thorough secret service on the planet. There is nothing your government does not know about anyone they want to know anything about. It&#39;s been that way for decades, and you&#39;re trying to tell me that so many hijackers were able penetrate US security, fly jetliners (for which they didn&#39;t have the experience to handle properly...unless you seriously count microsoft flight sim die hard experience) very precisely into the buildings, and with the freefall collapse of wtc7 (the middle of the building collapses first...you can see the penthouse disappear thanks to sloppy editing on most footage...also, how did it catch on fire again?) you can&#39;t honestly say that you don&#39;t think that there was something else behind the spectacle?</p>

<p>Zeitgeist, there was a conversation recalled by one of the rockafeller&#39;s close friends who said that there was going to be an event that was going to change the landscape of the US and that the ultimate goal was have citizens outfitted with a biometric chip that would contain all of your personal data thus allowing total control over your life and guess what surgical procedure your new healthcare covers?  The Obama Health care bill under Class II (Paragraph 1, Section B) specifically includes ‘‘(ii) a class II device that is implantable.&quot; Then on page 1004 it describes what the term &quot;data&quot; means in paragraph 1, section B:</p>

<p>14 ‘‘(B) In this paragraph, the term ‘data’ refers to in15
formation respecting a device described in paragraph (1),
16 including claims data, patient survey data, standardized
17 analytic files that allow for the pooling and analysis of
18 data from disparate data environments, electronic health
19 records, and any other data deemed appropriate by the
20 Secretary&quot;</p>

<p>Of course, there&#39;s also the conspiracy that the economic funk will only be solved by a North American Union, which Harper is basically already trying to turn Canada into the US for the last 5 years...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This will be a bit different than the typical posts here.  I will not talk about all the mechanics of 9/11 or anything like that.  I will show other sides to certain topics.  I will NOT show any type of 100% proofs or smoking guns.  Instead I will show a string of events and whatnot that will make you think that at the very least something is amiss, and let you choose yourself.  Some stuff minor, some stuff major.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Mayor Willie Brown receiving the warning call 8 hours before 9/11: <a href="http://propagandamatrix.com/willie_brown_got_low_key_early_warning.html">http://propagandamatrix.com/willie_brown_got_low_key_early_warning.html</a>
He later on said that the paper was wrong, they spreaded lies, ect.  Which is possible, it is after all a relatively large paper, and like most other mainstream media, spreading lies isn&#39;t that much of stretch.  However, for them to have said such a big lie like that and not get investigated which the country was so sensitive on this stuff, it doesn&#39;t make sense to me.  I&#39;m sure the FBI would be all over it if they heard a random person received warning 8 hours prior to 9/11.  For the paper to not even be touched on this issue, first off if what they said is true that doesn&#39;t make sense to me that it would go ignored, and second off if what they said is false it makes no sense to me that there was no reprimands for doing something as horrible as using 9/11 to spread lies like that.  Assuming it was a conspiracy, it wouldn&#39;t be too much of a stretch of the imagination to think he would be threatened or coerced himself after the article to stfu about it.  But that&#39;s just speculation.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPRQNCkdJxA">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPRQNCkdJxA</a>  FEMA was for some reason at NYC a single day before 9/11, ready to take action.  No, this doesn&#39;t mean every single member of FEMA would be in on it, as most lower level people they&#39;d just be following orders.  They get told its some training exercise, they&#39;re gone.  Hell, considering the attitudes of people I&#39;ve worked with in the past, I personally can see them simply being told &quot;Go here.&quot; and not thinking it suspicious at all.  I find FEMA being there to be a big coincidence by itself, let alone with everything else.</p></li>
<li><p>the famous NORAD war games.  Another very huge coincidence for me.  What worse day could they have chosen?  The overlapping war games and real life caused much confusion.  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ef8IY3zKEcc&amp;amp;feature=related">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ef8IY3zKEcc&amp;amp;feature=related</a> listening to that news piece, you can tell there was a lot of chaos and madness with them that day.  For them to be running a drill so similar to what was actually going on that day, it cannot be overlooked.  Yes, they had another reason for doing the war games listed, but that&#39;s not really surprising, of course they&#39;re going to give a reason for holding these war games, they&#39;re not just going to call it &quot;Training drills done to distract us from actual terrorist attacks.&quot;  So anyone pointing out that the war game&#39;s original purpose was something else is just bringing up a very bad argument.</p></li>
<li><p>Larry Silverstein&#39;s famous &quot;pull it&quot; comment.  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WYdAJQV100">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WYdAJQV100</a>  By itself, fine, you can make the case that he WASN&#39;T talking about exploding the building, he was talking about pulling the people out of there.  I have a very hard time swallowing that one, because pull it is a general demolition term, and that is a very odd way of saying &quot;Get those people out of there.&quot;  The overlap is worth noting.  To add to that, though, as it was accidentally exposed by fox news on a 9/11 conspiracy hit piece ( <a href="http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2010/04/22/jeffrey-scott-shapiro-jesse-venture-book-lies-truthers-ground-zero-sept-shame/">http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2010/04/22/jeffrey-scott-shapiro-jesse-venture-book-lies-truthers-ground-zero-sept-shame/</a> ), they said this revealing bit:
&quot;Shortly before the building collapsed, several NYPD officers and Con-Edison workers told me that Larry Silverstein, the property developer of One World Financial Center was on the phone with his insurance carrier to see if they would authorize the controlled demolition of the building – since its foundation was already unstable and expected to fall.&quot;
As it&#39;s been pointed so many times by the opponents of a conspiracy, it takes WEEKS to set up a controlled demolition.  If he thought the building was unstable and ready to fall, why would he want to risk workers going in and out of the building for a few weeks to set up the explosions?  This for me reveals a lot.  On a side note, there was that whole him putting an insurance policy on the buildings bit.</p></li>
<li><p>The even more famous Norman Mineta.  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bDfdOwt2v3Y">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bDfdOwt2v3Y</a>  First I&#39;m actually going to argue the other side.  The order may still stand, but he at no point said which order it is.  It could be as likely the order was to shoot it down as it is to stand down.  It could go either way, to be weary of this one.  In fact, listening to the full interview, the order is more likely for &quot;shoot them down&quot; than &quot;stand down.&quot;  Does this argue against a conspiracy?  Yes.  I don&#39;t like it when it gets brought up to argue for a conspiracy theory.  However: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-5PKQTUz5o&amp;amp;feature=related">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-5PKQTUz5o&amp;amp;feature=related</a>  Why did the 9/11 commission omit various parts of his testimony?  And why does it go so much against what Norman Mineta is saying?  While on this subject, another little tid bit is that there&#39;s a bit of a controversy over whether or not Cheney had direct control over NORAD based on something Bush signed into law May 8th of that year.  It didn&#39;t directly state he had Norad, but it could&#39;ve been interpreted that way.  According to Mr. Mineta, it sounds to me like at the very least, on this day, Cheney was calling the shots here.  But, again, for the other side, that can almost be considered a mute point if the order was to shoot the planes down instead of stand down.</p></li>
<li><p>The 9/11 commission report.  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tzrv-e37Es8">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tzrv-e37Es8</a>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnANe7w8pmY&amp;amp;feature=related">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnANe7w8pmY&amp;amp;feature=related</a> The Chairmans themselves thinks they were set up to fail.  For such an important commission, you&#39;d think they&#39;d get more funding and time.  <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/01/02/opinion/02kean.html?_r=1&amp;amp;ref=opinion">http://www.nytimes.com/2008/01/02/opinion/02kean.html?_r=1&amp;amp;ref=opinion</a>  Why the hell would they obstruct such an investigation?  <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/08/01/AR2006080101300.html?sub=new">http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/08/01/AR2006080101300.html?sub=new</a>  Why would people lie like this about this topic?  In the same article, &quot;&quot;I was shocked at how different the truth was from the way it was described,&quot; John Farmer, a former New Jersey attorney general who led the staff inquiry into events on Sept. 11, said in a recent interview. &quot;The tapes told a radically different story from what had been told to us and the public for two years. . . . This is not spin. This is not true.&quot; &quot;</p></li>
</ol>

<p>We have the 2 chairmen calling foul.  Commissioner Bob Kerrey says they couldn&#39;t do their job: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtJWBcWAeAw">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtJWBcWAeAw</a>  Commissioner Tim Roemer: <a href="http://articles.cnn.com/2006-08-02/politics/9-11panel.pentagon_1_criminal-probe-pentagon-world-trade-center?_s=PM:POLITICS">http://articles.cnn.com/2006-08-02/politics/9-11panel.pentagon_1_criminal-probe-pentagon-world-trade-center?_s=PM:POLITICS</a>  Max Clelend REALLY tore them apart on their bullshit: <a href="http://dir.salon.com/story/news/feature/2003/11/21/cleland/index.html?pn=1">http://dir.salon.com/story/news/feature/2003/11/21/cleland/index.html?pn=1</a> I think I missed one as well.</p>

<p>This is  the one part which I will be stating my view bluntly and directly, without worrying about sides.  With all of that that was just said from the horses mouth, if you don&#39;t want to believe the govt was behind it fine, but if ANYONE actually believes the 9/11 commission report, they&#39;re stupid and brainwashed.  Period.  There&#39;s no nice way of putting it.  &quot;This is true!&quot;  &#39;Actually, we&#39;re the ones who wrote this, this whole thing is full of lies....&quot;  &quot;That can&#39;t be, because it&#39;s true!&quot;  Is what it basically comes down to.  i have no nice thoughts for people this stupid.</p>

<p>If you wish me to, I will post a part 2 listing even more, and possibly a conclusion.  Just for now I&#39;ve been at this for nearly 2 hours so I feel like stopping.  If you want me to continue, just say so.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sorry, I think we&#39;ve misunderstood eachother. You said you downvoted him for saying he could &quot;debunk someone else&#39;s facts&quot;. Debunking facts is nonsense, because facts are facts. So had he said that, I&#39;d agree: downvote is in order. But he didn&#39;t say that, he implied he would debunk <em>arguments</em>, which is perfectly valid, and not a reason to downvote IMO.

    <div class="md"><p>I, too have probs w the Truther angle on this story.
Could someone please explain to me how a &quot;controlled demolition&quot; could have been prepered for a 36-storey occupied tower with no questions asked? I&#39;ve seen those Discovery Network shows about building demolition: it&#39;s painstaking, intricate work, involving exposing ALL support columns, placing and wiring TONS of explosives. It takes many days, usually weeks.</p>

<p>And as I understand it, the jet-fuel didn&#39;t &quot;melt&quot; the steel of the WTC structure, it merely softened the steel until the various joints lost integrity, then each floor pancaked onto the one below leading to the poof-poof-poof out the windows that Truthers think is &quot;controlled demolition&quot;...again, there was a really excellent 2-hour doc about it on TLC about a year after 9/11, I dunno its name.</p>

<p>So is it really possible for a small army of workmen ( cuz that&#39;s what it would take) to prepare a large building for demolition without the residents noticing...?</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>As Margie Burns reports in The American Reporter, an electronic daily newspaper, Marvin P. Bush, the president’s younger brother, was a principal in a company called Securacom that provided security for the World Trade Center, United Airlines, and Dulles International Airport. The company, Burns noted, was backed by KuwAm, a Kuwaiti-American investment firm on whose board Marvin Burns also served.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>...</p>

<blockquote>
<p>According to Wayne Black, head of a Florida-based security firm, it is somewhat unusual for a single firm to handle security for both an airline and a airport. It’s also unusual for a firm linked so closely with a foreign-owned company to handle security on such a “sensitive” international airport as Dulles. “When you have a security contract, you know the inner workings of everything,” he said. “Somebody knew somebody,” he added, or the contract would have been scrutinized more carefully.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, in order to place them, they&#39;d need to expose the steel of the columns....it&#39;s clearly not as simple a matter as placing one of these thermate-boxes next to the wall: much cutting, drilling and jackhammering would be necessary, just as you see in professional Demolition vids. No way that wouldn&#39;t be noticed by lots of people who work in the building.</p>

<p>And the &quot;911 debunked&quot; vid on the bar to the right takes each part of this tape and provides reasonable and sound alternative explanations.</p>

<p>Again, what the TLC 911 doc said was that the towers collapsed NOT because of damage to the external framework. It was not necessary to &#39;melt steel&#39; only to soften the bolts that suspended the floors, leading to a domino-effect. This is probably why the pilots were instructed to hit the top floors of the towers not the bottom half.</p>

<p>Look, I&#39;m sure you have reems of info that proves your various points, and that those who oppose your theories can provide counter-evidence to every point. It doesn&#39;t seem any minds are being changed here.</p>

<p>My main prob with the whole &quot;911 Inside Job&quot; conspiracy theory is the conspiracy itself. Too damn many people would need to remain silent about the most heinous mass-murder in American history. It&#39;s just not credible to me. Sure the Manhattan Project was kept secret....for about 2 years, during wartime, when even the dumbest janitor knew that loose lips sink ships. Here we are 10 years after 911 and not a single one of the hundreds if not thousands in on the conspiracy has stepped foreward...no cut-out dupe has gone public with his suspicions (&quot;I wondered why we were demo-ing that building, but I needed the job so just did as the boss said...&quot;).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Some see &quot;squibs&quot;. As an engineer, I see conservation of energy. The volume of air in the building had to come out somewhere. If those were squibs and the building was brought down with controlled demolitions throughout the structure, why do we see just a few puffs of debris? A few puffs is consistent with blown out windows due to a dramatic increase in pressure, not controlled demolitions.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t consider infowars.com to be an incredulous source. They fail to link their sources.</p>

<p>Somebody else posted this a few months back and I found it rather amusing as well as poignant. Consider this a bit of comic relief:</p>

<p>Government Spook 1: Hey Carl, we should also demolish WTC 7, I don&#39;t think blowing up the two largest, iconic buildings in the heart of the world&#39;s only superpower is going to be enough to scare people.</p>

<p>Government Spook 2: Frank, you&#39;re a genius! But we&#39;d better give the reporters a script to read before we do it, otherwise nobody will notice.</p>

<p>Government Spook 1: So your suggestion is that we give some of the world&#39;s foremost journalists, the kind of people whose job it is to investigate and break stories about corruption and murder and intrigue, whose names would go down in history for exposing the biggest conspiracy in the history of the planet, prior confirmation that we&#39;re going to blow the building up?</p>

<p>Government Spook 2: Exactly. We can&#39;t rely on the BBC using their cameras or eyes at any point to confirm that the building has collapsed, so it&#39;s best we pre-warn them. We&#39;ll be fine, unless BillyPilgrum uses his incredible powers of deduction to figure it all out.</p>

<p>Government Spook 1: Foolproof.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The question in and of itself connotes an ignorance of the issue. I don&#39;t believe that &quot;9/11 was an inside job&quot;. However, that is only one view on a fairly broad spectrum of views about how events unfolded on that day.  The easiest way to show the points on that spectrum are the acronyms that used to be used in the truth community. &quot;LIHOP&quot;, &quot;MIHOP&quot;.  &quot;Let it happen on purpose&quot;, &quot;Make it happen on purpose&quot;. There&#39;s a vast number of &quot;theories&quot; associated with both extremes, but the more you look into the evidence reasonably and rationally, a &quot;LIHOP&quot; theory becomes more and more likely - not involving the entire government, but rather a very small handful of people (probably five or less) who were in a position of sufficient power (and significant benefit from the attacks) to create the conditions where normal procedures that would have stopped such an attack became ineffective. </p>

<p>These include curiosities like the fact that in the months before 9/11 Cheney (or it might have been Rumsfeld, I honestly forget) changed the longstanding policy that fighter squadrons automatically had the authority to shoot down passenger planes that had been hijacked. The policy was changed so that the order had to be directly given by him - something which in a crisis situation would take precious dozens of minutes.  Interestingly the policy change was reversed not long after 9/11.</p>

<p>The still mysterious and inexplicable absence of the President, or indeed any transcripts of what the President was doing during the attacks, despite the fact that all the transcripts show that Dick Cheney appeared to be acting as Commander in Chief throughout the entire debacle. </p>

<p>The fact that the head of the Pakistani Intelligence Services or ISI was in Washington during the attacks, and just days earlier had been wired a large sum of money by the US authorities. </p>

<p>The confirmed presence of Israeli &quot;Students&quot; monitoring the attacks from a rooftop, and cheering as the planes hit the towers. This is not, as has been suggested, a hoax, if you search for them on Youtube, they were actually interviewed on Israeli TV about the event. </p>

<p>The speed with which the &quot;PATRIOT&quot; Act was introduced into the house and congress (the document was over 1500 pages long, and had clearly been sitting on a shelf waiting for just such an event) - the fact that Senators who demanded time to actually READ the bill were sent Anthrax in the mail (a strain that originated from a US Biowarfare lab).</p>

<p>Now.. Notice I haven&#39;t said <em>anything</em> about &quot;no planes&quot;, or &quot;a missile&quot;, or &quot;controlled demolition&quot;, or any of the normal wackiness associated with nutcase conspiracy theories. The fact is those elements, the physical evidence, are a distraction. One doesn&#39;t have to focus on those to find a clear paper trail that leads to the fact that there were most <em>definitely</em> people who were aware that this event was going to take place - to what extent they knew, we&#39;ll never know, but the second takeaway is that there are clearly groups and interests who not only benefited, but profited massively on the back of the attacks. </p>

<p>Read the story of <a href="http://justacitizen.net/">Sibel Edmonds</a>, as a very good starting point for a highly credible witness that will begin to take you down the rabbit hole. Among many other things, she found evidence that the FBI had been infiltrated by Turkish Intelligence, and not so indirectly implies that this is one of the major reasons why 9/11 was able to happen. Mind you, for being a whistleblower she basically had her life destroyed by the FBI, who tried desperately to stop her.</p>

<p>And finally. The planes were hijacked by 19 SAUDIS. The US invades AFGHANISTAN. Sorry. Doesn&#39;t add up. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;d love to hear someone explain why, if the government (or whoever) wanted to bring down the towers, they would would make up such a complicated scheme involving multiple planes being flown into multiple buildings with explosives wired in such buildings.  </p>

<p>There are so many possible points of failure, what happens if the hijacking is stopped or the planes miss the tower?</p>

<p>Sorry, but if you wanted to pull off a conspiracy it would be far easier to plant explosives and then claim there was car/van bomb.  Especially given that that already happened 10 years earlier, very plausible that someone would try it again, this time would more powerful bombs.</p>

<p>But no, we&#39;re supposed to believe they picked a conspiracy with lots and lots of points of failure instead.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah I like this. Going along with your style here...</p>

<p>Why wait?</p>

<p>Plane crashes. You have your finger on the button to detonate your secret thermal charges... and you wait while people get out?</p>

<p>Now you are going to wait for people get out before you implode the buildings? Wouldn&#39;t they have killed a lot more people if they just collapsed right after the crashes? That would have been a nightmare. Right after the second plane crashes, I&#39;d implode both buildings at the same time and building 7. Why wait?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Exactly, and what happens if one of the planes hits and the other doesn&#39;t, just blow one and hope there&#39;s enough debris that you can plausibly claim it knocked down the other?</p>

<p>I&#39;m sure part of the response will be &quot;the planes were remote controlled so it was 100% sure they&#39;d hit&quot;.  And if that&#39;s true, why bother with all the fake hijacking, having people call from the planes to report what was going on during the hijacking.</p>

<p>It&#39;s just layers and layers of complexity for no good reason.  Government do a lot of stupid things, but I don&#39;t believe they would come up with a hugely complex conspiracy when a very simple one would have done the trick just the same, been much easier to plan, and be much less likely to fail.</p>

<p>It seems most likely that a lot more happened than what they told us, some very high up people made some very poor decisions, and a lot of greasy underhanded things were happening behind the scenes.

<p>NORAD was designed to thwart external threats, specifically incoming Soviet missiles and bombers. They were completely ill-equipped for such an attack as that which (probably) happened on 9/11.</p>

<p>That Cheney was in charge is oft repeated, but sources are never given as far as I&#39;ve seen. If you can come up with a reputable source, I will look at it.</p>

<p>NORAD&#39;s lack of action is circumstantial at best. If NORAD had actually stood down, it speaks to the size of the conspiracy that would have had to be perpetrated (and yet nobody has come forward?). Again, NORAD was never designed to thwart a threat from within. That protocol didn&#39;t exist.</p>

<p>Black boxes were found. The only sites that claim otherwise fail to link to sources for that information.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I am noticing a lot of downvotes in this thread pertaining to posts that don&#39;t fit a certain hypothesis- y&#39;all are welcome to downvote, of course, it&#39;s your right, but I&#39;m seeing very little response and discussion. I just have one request, not to start arguments or bad blood, but if you downvote, tell us why!</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know about the other skeptics in thread, but I&#39;m genuinely curious as to the viewpoints of everyone. A downvote without a reason why doesn&#39;t teach me anything. Look, I feel no rancor or disgust at people who have what might be considered strange beliefs- we all walk around in our own realities, after all. It&#39;s sharing those realities with each other that gives us interesting windows into each others&#39; lives.</p>

<p>The main point is that I&#39;m disappointed that a group of people that I haven&#39;t always agreed with, but that I have respected as independent thinkers, are quashing dissenting opinions as quickly as the mainstream fact-quashers in the media and our national capitols.</p>

<p>I&#39;m also disappointed in that run-on sentence I just made.</p>

<p>If some of the hijackers were thought to be alive in the weeks after 9/11, where are they now?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ok, so you admit that errors in the investigation were made, however you find it hard to believe that maybe those &quot;terrorists&quot; were not even the ones that carried out the attack? I don&#39;t think we will ever really know who was on those planes and I highly doubt you will ever believe any of this.</p>

<p>By all means, go track them down. If they are alive and well then, why are you concerned about right now?  Then is what matters. That is like saying, well the towers aren&#39;t there anymore, so 9/11 never happened. We were told these were the guys and they died on those planes. Then it turns out that some weren&#39;t even in the country when it happened.</p>

<p>Now if I were plotting to do something like this, I would either set someone up or find someone to blame that is missing and most likely dead. Blaming a person that died 6 years ago is harder to fake then say someone with no record trail to follow. How would it look if on the news they said &quot;Bomber in shopping mall identified as Bernie Mack&quot;. A little less then convincing. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think you are getting off on a side note with this errors and investigation being &quot;bunk&quot;. Maybe other people are saying the investigation is &quot;bunk&quot;. However, I think the people investigating were limited and cut off from all the facts. I have done investigations, some small some large (not 9/11 large). Without the big picture, they wouldn&#39;t know what was true and what was false as far as who was on the plane. </p>

<p>Go track them down is in response to &quot;If some of the hijackers were thought to be alive in the weeks after 9/11, where are they now?&quot; I don&#39;t think it matters where they are now (what if they are dead now?), the real fact that you need to walk away with is that they were alive after the attack. Which would mean they didn&#39;t do it. So if they didn&#39;t do it, why were their passports found there? If they were planted, then who planted them and for what purpose? The thing you learn while investigating is that made up stories don&#39;t hold as you keep pulling at new areas and keep asking questions. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;the real fact that you need to walk away with is that they were alive after the attack.&quot;</p>

<p>Save for the confusion that followed in the days after the attack (let&#39;s be honest, that&#39;s understandable), there are no credible reports of alleged hijackers actually being alive. My simple explanation: The guy found to be alive was simply thought to be a suspect based on the little information that they had at the time.</p>

<p>Again, I will objectively look at any evidence contrary to this.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There is one simple proof that it was an inside job. Just the way the buildings collapsed demolition style goes to show you it was an insider job. Jet fuel doesn&#39;t burn that hot to melt the re-enforced steel columns. Jet fuel is essentially highly-refined kerosene. As a normal hydrocarbon it is limited to burning no hotter than 1200 degrees. Thermite, on the other hand, burns at 2500 degrees celsius, hot enough to melt those steel columns; they used Thermite to bring down those buildings. All 3 buildings collapse in demolition style manner, plus you got all these eye witnesses claiming they heard constant explosions while the buildings were collapsing. The list goes on and on, just accept the truth man; no need to defend it. Their plan worked just as well, we&#39;re at war, and war = money for corporations. End of story.</p>

We all know how well these things are sealed. Would a simple collapse allow dust inside? Maybe. But maybe explosive force was to blame. That&#39;s what the recovery experts seem to believe.</p>

<p>It is not possible for experienced pilots to turn an aircraft around in the time required between the time that the planes went off radar and then reappeared. It may have been a fluke for one of the inexperienced hijackers to keep the plane in the air during a turn, but not two,</p>

<p>In order to fly the aircraft the hijackers would have to be in the pilot seat. The black boxes show that the locked doors to the pilots cabins were not opened between takeoff and the crashes.</p>

<p>After the collapse of the towers the contents of the towers and the aircraft were pulverized. Yet, the wallet of one of the hijackers, containing his ID and other incriminating information, was found intact. </p>

<p>Both &quot;crashes&quot; did not produce any plane debris and no black boxes were found (never before that day had no black boxes been found).</p>

<p>At the Pentagon, there was no evidence of the engines which should have made impact holes of their own.  In fact, the nose of the plane is quite fragile compared to the engines.  If anything, the hole on the side of the Pentagon should have been very wide representing the engines.</p>

The only &quot;possible conspirarcy&quot; would be if it was announced that Flight 93 was shot down.

    <div class="md"><p>Uh, if it were &quot;controlled&quot; it wouldn&#39;t be &quot;unexplained&quot;, would it?</p>

<p>WTC7 has been discussed in this thread. My TL;DR position: structural damage to WTC1 and/or 2 debris, a less than ideal design due to it straddling a power substation, both compounded by hours of fires is a reasonable explanation for why WTC7 fell.</p>

<p>After all, firefighters anticipated that might WTC7 fall while they were fighting the fires. Why is it such a surprise that it did?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The &quot;fire brought it down&quot; scenario is complete bullshit. </p>

<p>First off the smoke seen around building 7 nearly all came from the two main buildings.the damage was all on one CORNER and could never have caused a completely symmetrical collapse. since it was anything but symmetrical. </p>

<p>If there was an intense fire that could bring down a building that size, this thing was huge,  how in the hell did this much diesel fuel not catch fire when it was located  mostly in the elevator shafts</p>

<p>“A cleanup is underway to remove tens of thousands of gallons of oil that spilled from 7 World Trade Center when the 47-story office tower collapsed on Sept. 11, according to a published report.
Citing an environmental impact report made public by the Empire State Development Corp., Newsday reported Thursday that 130,000 gallons of oil leaked from the Con Edison substation contained within the building. 
Additional oil leaked from two 6,000-gallon storage tanks owned by Salomon Smith Barney, and conduits beneath the building may have contained asbestos and feeder lines wrapped in a material containing toxins, the report said. 
Two 11,690-gallon diesel fuel tanks operated by Silverstein Properties were also inside the building, but were removed in March and April and showed no evidence of spillage, Newsday said. “</p>

<p>Steel yields at a much lower temperature than its melting point. At 1500 F steel loses roughly 90% of its strength. The steel didn&#39;t have to melt before it became incapable of supporting the weight of the structure above.</p>

<p>It really doesn&#39;t look like a controlled demolition.

I agree with you that the evidence here is not good. 
Rather an open call for evidence, I would suggest watching Zeitgeist or Loose Change (both free on google video). Then if you have issues with any part of either movie, I&#39;m sure many of us will be happy to discuss them with you. 
And if neither of those movies can convince you, then I wouldn&#39;t really bother much more about it really... seems like it would just be a waste of time... they are the best we&#39;ve got so far.</p>

Its quite simple terrorists flew planes into the twin towers. the fuel caused a fire the weight of the plain combined withe the fire damage weakened the structure it the collapsed. debri from the towers landed on or near WT7 causing fire damage if you look at the footage you see the small building on the roof collapse first. a small number of people planed this and excited it you have to ask why they would do this instead you are ignoring the real issue.</p>

<p>There is no such thing as &quot;free fall speed&quot;. There is something called terminal velocity, but that&#39;s entirely different.</p>

<p>Free fall is an acceleration, not a speed. It&#39;s roughly 9.81 m/s/s on earth near the ground. The towers did not fall at free fall acceleration. Now that you have the number, you can actually time it yourself and see that your comment is untrue.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>OK, freefall ACCELERATION:</p>

<p>d = at<sup>2</sup> where d = distance, a = acceleration, and t = time.</p>

<p>d = 417 meters (to top of roof)
a = 9.8 m/s/s</p>

<p>solve for t... at freefall, something falling 417 meters would fall to the ground in 9.225 seconds.</p>

<p>The towers collapsed in (drumroll...):</p>

<p>WTC1: 11 seconds
WTC2: 9 seconds</p>

Authorities freaked out: no one would ever believe that is was accidental crashes. So they said it was terrorists, and they fired a missile at the pentagon and gunned down an extra plane to make it look more believable, and add an heroic layer to the story. But the first two planes in the towers were a freak accident.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I like how you address only one of my 6 counter points to what you said and then ask me for citation on the quality of cameras that pentagon would use in for all-weather observation of large objects 10 years ago. Remember before 9/11 it was a bad thing to have a big &quot;homeland security&quot; budget. They weren&#39;t forced to do anything, they chose to. If you think they slapped high definition camera&#39;s in custom weatherproof casings and mounted of them on the outside pointing in every goddamn direction you&#39;ve completely given up reason. But if evidence is that important to you I&#39;m sure the type of camera they have installed is buried in their public budget records from before 2001, hidden with sinister intent obviously. Since you&#39;re the one that can&#39;t propose an argument that makes holds water and need it to believe in the obvious truth you can be the one to dig it up. While we&#39;re on the subject of citation I looked up the validity of your anti-aircraft claim. <a href="http://www.jod911.com/There_Are_No_Missile_Defenses_at_the_Pentagon.pdf">Here</a> is a paper that goes over every source of that information (none of it was government official) and discredits it. The paper then goes on to provide this contrary evidence to your statement:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The proof lies in the fact that the Pentagon was forced to emplace missile defenses at the Pentagon after 9/11, 
from CNN September 11th, 2002.
For the first time since the Cuban missile crisis almost 40 years ago, armed missile launchers 
will be protecting the nation&#39;s capital by day&#39;s end Tuesday -- a precaution that comes amid a 
heightened alert status on the eve of the one-year anniversary of the September 11 attacks.</p>

<p>If you can&#39;t bother to read the other side of every conspiracy you have lost the ability for critical thinking and are simply a tool for people creating lies in order to make money off people like you. If you still believe in your 2 points after this then you&#39;re simply someone who has no place in a researched discourse.</p>

<p>Just to clear this up as well, _dimension implied simply that there is no need for an extensive camera system on the outside of a building that has armed guard around the whole perimeter on a 24/7 basis and I agree with his logic fully.</p>

<p>*<em>TL;DR you still believe because this post isn&#39;t a video with poor production values, a couple million views and DVD on sale for 9.99 (because everyone knows adsense doesn&#39;t pay enough) *</em></p>

<li><p>Kind of a change in topics, but alright.  I did in fact notice how loud the controlled demolition is.  As you said, thermite is given as an explanation, and a very legit one at that.  If it is more quiet than conventional explosives, then it would make perfect sense for them to use that one instead.  Truthers don&#39;t ignore that part at all, there have been some explanations covering those parts, parts which I myself have been sketchy about so I personally don&#39;t like to bring it up.  As with the rest of us on either side, I don&#39;t have all the pieces to the puzzle.  But I do know that the basic human hivemind would not ask questions if they saw some random official looking people around their building every now and then, they would just shrug it off, say its for another dept, and be on their way with their own business.  Now, I&#39;m having some real big issue with the way you are describing nanothermite.  What you mean inventing?  It&#39;s been researched by the U.S. military since the early 1990&#39;s.  Conspiracy theorists didn&#39;t invent anything with that.  And it is not super secretive, nothing about it is.  Quit trying to muddy the issue by saying such random, made up things, that is all you are doing by saying such lies.  I have to admit, you made me briefly question myself and made me look up nanothermite to see if I&#39;ve been following a lie.  This non-existent super secretive thing has a wikipedia page among other things.  <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=nanothermite&amp;amp;ie=utf-8&amp;amp;oe=utf-8&amp;amp;aq=t&amp;amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&amp;amp;client=firefox-a#sclient=psy&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;safe=off&amp;amp;client=firefox-a&amp;amp;hs=9aS&amp;amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-US%3Aofficial&amp;amp;q=nano+thermite+-9%2F11+-wtc+-towers&amp;amp;aq=f&amp;amp;aqi=&amp;amp;aql=&amp;amp;oq=&amp;amp;pbx=1&amp;amp;fp=241062ed1d424d73">http://www.google.com/search?q=nanothermite&amp;amp;ie=utf-8&amp;amp;oe=utf-8&amp;amp;aq=t&amp;amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&amp;amp;client=firefox-a#sclient=psy&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;safe=off&amp;amp;client=firefox-a&amp;amp;hs=9aS&amp;amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-US%3Aofficial&amp;amp;q=nano+thermite+-9%2F11+-wtc+-towers&amp;amp;aq=f&amp;amp;aqi=&amp;amp;aql=&amp;amp;oq=&amp;amp;pbx=1&amp;amp;fp=241062ed1d424d73</a>  Where do you get this made up stuff from?</p></li>
<li><p>Yeah, of course they&#39;re going to have to give a reason for conducting the war games.  While we should know why they wanted to do those war games to begin with, we shouldn&#39;t immediately be satisfied with the first reason they give us though.  The government lies, always has, probably always will.  If the conspiracy is right, it doesn&#39;t take much to figure out that they&#39;re going to say the war games were for a different reason.  Doesn&#39;t take much critical thinking here.</p></li>
<li><p>You are taking the original point of the double tree video out of context.  There was no reason, ESPECIALLY if the video didn&#39;t have anything to show, to keep it from the people for so long, let alone requiring a lawsuit.  It is for that reason that I see that they had no issue releasing that particular video, much like that other pentagon one; because it had nothing to show.  Doesn&#39;t matter if there were hundreds upon hundreds of video cameras pointed directly at the crash site, if they confiscate them all but release the 1 or 2 tapes that don&#39;t show anything, that&#39;ll be enough to convince people such as yourself that there&#39;s nothing going on.  The hundreds and hundreds of tapes was just to illustrate my point, nothing else.  On the other hand, just throwing random theories out there, if the video did by chance show something like some other plane flying above the pentagon, a year would be more than enough time to remove it via editing.  But I don&#39;t really have much to go by that, I&#39;m just using it as an example of things that could be done behind the scenes.</p></li>
<li><p>Oh, hey, look, a website dedicated to debunking 9/11 truthers, I&#39;m SURE they&#39;ll post evidence and testimonials against what they&#39;re trying to say.  That was just lazy.  Moving on.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Actually, my whole point about them being passively coerced into altering their stories (&quot;I saw what looked like a missile,&quot;  &#39;It was actually a plane sir, please say that.&quot;) was completely ignored.  I&#39;m not saying all of these are coerced testimonials, and I&#39;m not ignoring them.  You, however, seem to be ignoring my other inquiry about the other eyewitnesses who for some reason said things other to the contrary.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Fire plus <em>massive structural damage</em></p>

<p>The &quot;first time in history&quot; deal is thrown around a lot but is demonstrably untrue. There are several examples of modern steel and concrete structures collapsing solely due to fire. Just a few:</p>

<p>Interstate 580
Kader Factory
Dogwood Elementary
Mumbai High North Platform
Windsor Building</p>

<p>None of the above collapses were compounded by massive structural damage.</p>
