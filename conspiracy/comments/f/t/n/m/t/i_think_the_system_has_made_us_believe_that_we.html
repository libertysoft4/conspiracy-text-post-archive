<p>You should, because it&#39;s not as easy as it seems.  It&#39;s actually very difficult to grow your own food, because:</p>

<p>a) it takes time - what are you going to eat for 4 months while you wait for your food to grow?  can you plant systematically so that you have a constant harvest?  what will you do in the winter?</p>

<p>b) it is hard to set up a self-sufficient cycle - where will you get fertilizer/clean soil?  compost?  this, again, all seems obvious but until you actually try it you are in for a tough lesson.</p>

<p>Start growing now so you get experience.  Experience is <em>everything</em> when it comes to gardening/farming.  Put some tomato seeds in some pots if nothing else.  Good luck!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You do make a very good point about growing food. I am certainly under experienced with it at this point. So my plan isn&#39;t 100% fool proof, but my plan should be more robust than one would think. The wild food thing can account for a lot. Here in the bountiful Willamette valley I&#39;m familiar with a range of plants that span the seasons. There are berries from mid summer to late fall. I&#39;ve tried some weeds that are a good spinach substitute. Fruit tree&#39;s a plenty (Also mushroom, nuts, wild grains &amp; seeds, many things can be harvested and stored, dried, canned, etc.). And even during the mid winter there is a variety of things to dig up and cook. Hop over the mountains to the coast - the sea teeming with shell fish, seaweed, fish and other things. And much more. If you know what your doing, provided you live in an adequately fertile region, it would be little effort to gather a meal or two every day. And I forgot to mention bugs. Also like the Indians did, when a plant comes into fruiting season, you can gather a troop of friends and harvest the larger crops like acorn, walnut, hazelnut (These are in my area). Though the acorn needs the tannins extracted, it is a staple food. In Eule Gibbons book stalking the wild asparagus, he notes that the human family has consumed far more tons of acorns than all the cereal crops combined in our history.</p>

<p>As for contemporary/modern food stuff&#39;s and crops. If access to food, oil, other commodities were suddenly limited or stopped I believe myself and my neighbors would obviously have a rough year. But together we&#39;ve got a number of gardens and fruit tree&#39;s. My house hold has an emergency supply of food, but without additional supplementary food, it would last perhaps a 4-6 months between three or four.</p>

<p>I might also add that many people raise their own meat from smaller game like pigeon, rabbit, chickens, etc. Something I&#39;d like to do as well, the animals also take your scrap food and organics and turn it into compost.</p>

<p>So I&#39;m not prepared as well as others might be, but its a work in progress. I probably should take some of the advice inferred here and perhaps put a few more crops in this year. But I would also advise others to start learning about the wild foods around their regions. Aside from the obvious choice of hunting wild game, there is a bunch of wild plants that may come in very handy.</p>

<p>Since it seems we are also speaking about a potential/inevitable end to oil/cheap oil in the US, you might be interested to see this; the US embargo against cuba caused a similar event in 1960, including the end of food and oil imports, where in the nation had to suddenly rely on itself for food production. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jRz34Dee7XY">This is the Video</a>.</p>

<p>I had a friend that &quot;lived in the woods&quot; and his neighbors dog got into his property and my friends dogs roughed it up.</p>

<p>After that for a year the neighbor when he had the opportunity he would shoot at the dogs. He shot one and it survived. He even cut some weird deal with the sheriff to come shoot the dogs!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve had a customer who called in once, said they did this sort of thing. Stopped using currency, and just relied on themselves for everything, grew their own food and whatnot. </p>

<p>Sad to say, they called about their debt to a bank, and wanted to pay their remaining debt in sacks of potatoes. He was in thousands of dollars in debt, and was late in payments. Not sure of the exact amount. I told him it&#39;s not possible to settle a debt in currency with potatoes, but the dude was serious, called in a supervisor and he just gave him a mailing address of a collections office. Not sure how they&#39;d respond to that. </p>

<p>My point is, the idea is awesome. Not relying on anything or anyone for you to live, but make sure you settle everything before jumping ship. I for one would love to be able to live like this. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>For similar reasons, this is why I hate property tax. </p>

<p>If everything else in a person&#39;s life crashes, they should be able to retreat to their property and be left alone if they choose. The system is rigged with property tax so that you are permanently enslaved to the system to pay an annual tax on something you already paid tax on when it was purchased. </p>

<p>Property tax should be extracted through utility usage if used.  If you go off the utility grid and are free of liens, you shouldn&#39;t have to owe anything to anyone to keep your land in perpetuity and bequeath it to anybody you choose without taxation.  </p>

<p>No one is truly safe from this state sponsored extortion, and the Supreme Court&#39;s reworked evil spawn, eminent domain.  </p>

Of course, they wouldn&#39;t at all reflect their counterparts, and many would be dismissed altogether. They&#39;d need to be designed by community voting as transparent, emergent organisations with the right foundations. Decentralised community focus and free-association. Revolutionaries need only make blueprints but the concepts of which must be easily explained. Success is dependant on individual sovereigns finding their voices, and knowing how to act. Not everyone is studying and practicing the alternate.</p>
