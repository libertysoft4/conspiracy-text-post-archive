<p>These group of hacktivists are protesting corruption and illicit activities that affect our world. There are a minority in Anonymous that engage in activities that detract from the overall goal. But, you can&#39;t blame Anonymous for standing up for what&#39;s right in society. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>We can all help in our own little ways. It starts by recognizing that the people who hold the money and the power are the enemy -- that there is no external threat from terrorism or invasion, the threat is internal and comes from those who have designed and who run the system of oppression and extortion.</p>

<p>Once we recognize this, we can begin to communicate this awareness to others. When the realization dawns, it can never be extinguished.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Let us not forget that the practise of terrorism is very real and has been evolving along with man for hundreds of thousands of years.  Indeed, modern terrorism is the direct result of our long-term foreign policy along with the incorporation of new technologies into warfare.  In a statistical context, terrorism should be of little concern as it doesn&#39;t kill many people relative to other causes.  Not yet at least.</p>

Just because the cause isn&#39;t something you support. IMO it&#39;s identical. The regulation of information closely relates to examples which center around the creation, management, and usage of roads both public and private.
Traffic patterns, congestion, risk, management, enforcement...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is what I try and explain to everyone I ride with. Florida recently made the no seat belt thing a primary crime. Both driver and passenger.</p>

<p>A cop can ruin your day even if you have <strong>nothing</strong> you can really be pulled over for. Your cocky attitude <em>will</em> have him/her search for shit you didn&#39;t even know existed. Crooked light, too low light on bumper, 1 mile over the limit, swerved too much, saw you on the phone. Cops can and will make shit up. They can and will ruin your day and days after (court).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I googled &quot;anonymous internet crimes&quot; and found <a href="https://cybercrimes.wordpress.com/category/anonymous/page/4/">this blog</a> that reports on some criminal behavior.

<p>It is like being apart of the anti-war movement, if you don&#39;t agree with what the people with bullhorns are saying - get your own bullhorn.
