<p>When it seems Jon is about to put the pieces together, he backs off. Like when Condoleezza Rice or John Yoo went on the program. All the questions we were waiting for him to ask, he didn&#39;t. He just laughed like a retard at their lame jokes and rhetoric, not to mention agreeing with their justifications when the hot topic was touched on lightly.</p>

<p>Edit: If Jon Stewart really cared about the  corruption he and his writers divulge, he would join an actual news network and serve as an example to Fox and company&#39;s hypocrisy.</p>

<p>Fuck you Jon, fuck you. You&#39;re not helping.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Give the man credit. He can only do so much given his position. Yes we want more, and he&#39;s capable of giving us more, but he and his staff have chosen their strategy. It is just one may to attack a very complex set of problems.</p>

<p>No doubt, The Daily Show and Colbert reveal a lot of truths. However, they cannot reveal them all. It&#39;s up to each of us to do our part in revealing the truth - whatever the hell it really is - to ourselves and to others.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know about how other people progressed, but Jon, Stephen and many other satirists opened the door I was already peaking through. It was a door separating me from the illusion and the path to truth. They made it safe for me to go through that door. Ever since I did, I haven&#39;t looked back.</p>

<p>I may have outgrown the Daily Show due to my own search but I recognize what they did for me years ago.</p>

<p>Plus, he&#39;s a comic foremost, so stop trying to force him into a role he repeatedly explains he doesn&#39;t want.</p>

<p>Jon Stewart is a comedian, if he looks like a journalist to you, it is the the journalists fault for behaving in a way that confuses them with comedians. Don&#39;t ask the jester to stop acting silly because the nobles are flinging poo all over the place (not the most graceful analogy, but I&#39;m not a journalist either).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>And if you did have the means, you have the talent and tenacity for what you&#39;re requesting?  Quite large shoes there.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t really see any issue with what Jon has done.  Do I THINK that he could possibly begin delving a bit deeper into the niche The Daily Show made?  Yeah, probably.</p>

<p>Do I think, at this point, after 10 years of The Daily Show doing what they&#39;ve done, that anyone who doesn&#39;t want to understand the message of the corrupt, meaningless, if not evil media, won&#39;t understand it?  Yeah, I think they&#39;ve pretty much made their point to the masses who want to hear it.. But I think you aren&#39;t giving them credit with that point and format they used to make it.. </p>

<p>And hell, dude, maybe THEY don&#39;t know exactly what to do with the power they have, I can&#39;t pretend I would know, but you seem awfully sure of yourself, I&#39;m sure thats exactly what we need more of in this country, overly confident people of power.</p>

<p>But, there is NOTHING he&#39;s done that is untrustworthy or necessitating anyone saying hes not up up to snuff for us.  </p>

<p>And your line &quot;Fuck you Jon, fuck you. You&#39;re not helping.&quot; ... Meh.  In this situation, I think the argument could really be made, hes given you the most help you&#39;re gonna get.  Maybe you should vent your frustration elsewhere?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Okay, okay, let me just break this down..</p>

<p>In your mind, correlating you interviewing people, for your own knowledge, which is great and dandy and hats off to you...</p>

<p>As your prerequisite, and a comparison against, Jon Stewart, for why you have the personality and tenacity to criticize and change the federal government and national media, if given his means?</p>

<p>So.. you talked to some chemists.. And that correlates to you changing the world, if you had the means.. how?  Again, OVERLY CONFIDENT and self promoting people is probably one of the larger issues we face, but, if we don&#39;t see eye to eye on that, it&#39;s cool.   </p>

<p>I apologize if my initial message was derogatory, I just really don&#39;t think ripping on Stewart, of all people, is even CLOSE to being worthy of discussion.</p>

<p>If we want to have a talk about where the The Daily Show should go with it&#39;s message, I&#39;d be more than supportive, I believe The Daily Show, in a strange way, should learn from other, even fictional shows...</p>

<p>Look at the likes of the Simpsons, focused on Bart for quite a few years, as the show grew, they readjusted their focus upon Homer.. South Park readjusted their focus more keenly and directly on political and social satire..</p>

<p>I think Jon should readjust his focus, from being 90% on the ridiculousness that is the media, to be more squarely fixated upon the inner workings and corruption within Congress and The House, but, I dont know how to make a funny show based largely on that, which, unfortunately, is his job, to get ratings, for being humorous.  </p>

<p>His role, for us, as someone else said, was to crack the door open for us, we needed to walk through and figure the rest out.  He can only do so much with the forum he has.</p>

<p>And, again, I doubt even Jon knows what to do with the power he has right now.. Which, for me, makes me like him more.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think Jon is just a man who fully realizes his limitations. If he pushes people too hard, then he can&#39;t get the range of interviewees. How many respectable Republicans do you see fairly interviewed on MSNBC? How many respectable Dems get fairly interviewded on FOX? Jon Stewart is a man that can have the president, the first lady, John Boehner, and Nancy Pelosi on his show. 
He makes observations but ultimately lets people decide for themselves if what they are hearing is true or false. He is not telling you what to think like the fringe networks, he just points out the great lies when given the opportunity. 
I love watching his political, observational humor and would not wish a career in politics on anyone. He is riding a fine line and doing it magnificently imo.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree with your sentiments.</p>

<p>It seems that John Stewart plays a much needed role for the global elite---He questions and pokes fun at obviously our corrupted insitutions without ever taking his complaints the necessary step further. He dances around the truth and uses his amiable comedic personality to distract us from the unsettling fact that he is an integral part of the problem.</p>

<p>He heavily encourages the right vs. left paradigm by stoking the raging bipartisan fire whenever he can, which means he&#39;s either not very intelligent, which I don&#39;t buy, or, perhaps his show is actually part of a hidden agenda that&#39;s working to quell popular dissent and funnel it into the futile realm of conventional political solutions which produce no real change.</p>

<p>Oh yea, and his brother is Larry Leibowitz, Chief Operating Officer of the New York Stock Exchange--The fact that, during one of he many soap-box tirades against the financial institutions of this country, he never acknowledged his close personal relationship to one of the heads of America&#39;s dwindling financial sector is evidence enough to suggest something isn&#39;t right here. He could have at least once breifly mentioned on his show his seemingly significant familial connection to the COO of the NYSE, if nothing else but for the purposes of showing people like us he has nothing to hide and thereby dismissing any wild theories such as the ones being discussed in this thread. But he didn&#39;t.</p>

<p>Oh yeah, and that last paragraph makes no sense. Why would he go on tirades against the financial institution at all if he has a vested interest in keeping the way it is? Maybe he doesn&#39;t like his brother. Maybe they aren&#39;t close. In any case, it&#39;s irrelevant.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I would like that at least one time after another exposé of some corrupt douchebag, he would tell his viewers to call, email, etc their representatives and demand satisfaction, or give them the boot. But nothing. His viewers are slacktivists. Unless he tells them too, they won&#39;t have the initiative to do it themselves. </p>

<p>All they need is a little push and that is not happening, and they are careful not to do it, or else get accused for inciting civil unrest. Have some balls, Stewart. </p>

<p>He does get &quot;intellectual&quot; when he needs to look serious at the camera and tell someone off, and appeal to emotion such as his 9/11 responders rant. Do just his words have an effect? I haven&#39;t seen anything yet. So encouraging people to just think is not enough, we need them to ACT.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I disagree completely. His show basically revolves around exposing corrupt leaders, how is that bad? The Daily Show is political satire, it&#39;s not investigative journalism. If he was to be too aggressive with his questions/rhetoric to politicians than it would cease to be funny and it would just be uncomfortable for viewers to watch. There is a delicate balance that must be maintained between serious and funny, and Jon seems to be the only one on tv who really knows how to do that in an entertaining yet thought provoking way.</p>

<p>TL;DR: Shut up, it&#39;s comedy.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>A while back, I wrote a paper on the role and affect of satire in society which pretty much came to the conclusion that satire as a force for change has stagnated and become impotent. Back when satire and open mockery of government was rare and thus quite revolutionary, it had a substantial effect on culture and the public&#39;s relationship with the government.</p>

<p>Roll forward to today and satire is incredibly common place. It&#39;s all over the television and internet. It&#39;s become pervasive and invasive. With such a flood of satire, people become cynical about politics, they don&#39;t find it serious or important. It devolves into having the same importance as sport politics. </p>

<p>You could argue that the government tolerates satire directed at itself as satire can be seen as a release valve for the peoples frustrations. It assists in the maintenance of peace and calm amongst the public and prevents them from becoming so frustrated that they rebel or revolt. The Daily Show might believe themselves to be fighting for sense and rationality, but they may actually be participants or a component to maintaining the current government political system.</p>

<p>There is also an integral factor to left wingers, which is their approach tends to focus on what we should be doing as a collective. Satire works to pacify them as they can stroke their chins and agree that something should be done. It satisfies their need to rebel and protest because they simply agree that the system is broken. They give their support, but more often than not, they are not active participants. This is dangerous if we hope to obtain a politically dynamic and progressive society.</p>

<p>The irony of my statements though is that I could well be playing the role of a release valve for people frustrated with satire not having the effect we desire it to have on government. You could just agree with me, carry on with your day and nothing changes. Hopefully, I&#39;m not just inducing apathy but inspiring others to take a greater stand in their political system and social roles.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think your expectations are a bit high. The policy of politicians is &quot;deny, deny, deny&quot;. Politicians are in the business of lies, false promises, and misrepresentations. It&#39;s not like Jon is going to get any other shady people to actually admit to any wrong doing. Thinking back to the episode with the Mad Money guy, Jim Cramer, and his pathetic explanations followed by damning video of evidence of him - Jim&#39;s not a politician and it was easy to pull that off. Also, it&#39;s common for questions to be preselected prior to the interview, and that&#39;s a part of what those blue cards he holds are. </p>

<p>I agree with you. I wish some organization could take on the people who pull strings, make big decisions - but to expect funny man Jon and his staff to take it on their shoulders is unfair.  </p>
