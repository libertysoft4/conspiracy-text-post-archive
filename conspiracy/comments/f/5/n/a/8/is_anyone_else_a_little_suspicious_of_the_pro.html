I know we are big trading partners and their leader is here, and I know that they own quite a bit of our debt, but this still strikes me as a bit off. What do you think?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, I&#39;ve picked up on that as well. And it&#39;s not limited to television. CNN, MSNBC, Fox, etc. are rife with what reads as pro-China stories. I read a lot of news everyday. I visit over 30 newsites per day and because of this I am pretty astute when it comes to picking up on trends long before most. Something is afoot. It might not play itself out for a few more years, but then again....</p>

<p>Another thing, China seems to be hellbent on elevating its status on the world stage very very quickly. It&#39;s almost as if they are working against some unseen time-frame. They&#39;ve always aspired but up until lately they seemed content to take their time. Not anymore. Just in the last two weeks they&#39;ve unveiled a stealth fighter, purchased an aircraft carrier, announced they were going to build the world&#39;s largest skyscraper, announced loans to EU countries, are moving towards making the Yuan the dominant international currency and more. Maybe these two events, the pro-China propaganda and this seemingly sudden desire to be number one in everything are connected.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>China&#39;s technology in military applications is decades behind, but far more important, their military has not been in a major conflict since the Korean War. Training exercises can never account for complications of war, and without the experience to know the shortcomings in their military any major campaign would be subject to unaccounted disasters. While the United States has the same amount of super carriers as the rest of the world has in diesel carriers, we also maintain our own fleet of diesel carriers which trumps the worlds carriers over again. Forgetting to mention the superiority of our aircraft on those carriers would be to undermine their purpose and exposing how outmatched china will be in naval forces for the next hundred years. While we hone our blade of war with expert experience, technology, training, tactics, and automate many manned positions that would be under threat in a war of attrition. China is just starting to look for the materials in which to craft such a blade. The threat of china is economic, however it would seem as though there is mutual assured destruction between the west and China in which we are both dependent on each other for resources. Painting China as a great threat could only be useful in maintaining the fear in American and encourage more defense spending even in the possible implosion of our economy. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Was talking to my dad who is an electrical engineer that studies Chinese radar and missile systems, we have many counters to the system including the new laser missile defense system, radar controlled miniguns, counter ballistic missiles, radar jamming, and not to mention our first priority would be to send planes to take them out in a preemptive strike while the carriers wait at a safe distance. We&#39;ve come a long way since the wild weasels in detection and destruction of enemy air/naval counter measures. All the hype is just a ploy like many of the fears we had on soviet systems. When the bear bomber appeared in Russian airspace it caused an unneeded scare since it was so slow and underpowered that it would have been shot down 2 seconds into NATO airspace. My dad rarely talks to me about his work because of the security in its nature, however he did give me an example of the Chinese inexperience in naval warfare. He says &quot;The Russians did have some good systems, in fact I still don&#39;t know how a few of them work but the Chinese....oh the Chinese...they built a radar based defense system for a destroyer that only covers the front half of the ship.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>When whatever is going to happen, happens, we go about smuggly declaring we knew it was going to happen. </p>

<p>There isn&#39;t one frickin&#39; thing we can do, we are powerless. We can&#39;t even get our Homeowners Association to give us the &quot;ok&quot; to park our boat in our own driveway. We&#39;re a long way from impacting international politics. </p>

<p>I suspect China is trying desperately to position itself on the world stage ahead of a world-wide reorganization of sorts, which they have been made aware of ahead of it actually happening. They&#39;re working desperately to wrangle a dominant position with dominant rights and voting power. </p>

<p>Or, they see something coming, economic calamity perhaps, affecting the entire world, and they want to make sure that they will emerge as the world&#39;s dominant economy after the dust settles, somewhat, because things will forever be changed. </p>

<p>What can we do? Hoard silver (gold if you can afford it right now). Get your $$$ out of stocks and bonds and into commodities, including food and energy. Shed your debt to zero. Arm yourselves and load up on ammo. Prepare your home, make it nearly impenetrable. Purchase camping gear, all camo and highly weather resistant. Purchase a book on nature and the available foods out there in the woods and how to prepare them. Stock up on antibiotics and other medicines that will be very expensive or unattainable. Hell I could go on forever. This is something I do for fun when I am in bed and unable to sleep. I plan for the apocalypse by making a mental list of things to do or get ahead of time. </p>

<p>The reality is, I&#39;m single and I live alone. I&#39;m going to simply off myself.   </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Communism is a sociopolitical movement that aims for a classless and stateless society structured upon common ownership of the means of production, free access to articles of consumption, and the end of wage labour and private property in the means of production and real estate.[1]</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Edit:   My roommate is from China.  He is finishing his masters here in the states.  He says that China is only communist politically.  They don&#39;t allow any other parties to compete.  Economically, China is completely capitalistic.  He also pointed out that in China they do very little to help the poor.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You guys are stupid.  All of you...</p>

<p>You notice it now because it&#39;s a blitz campaign to make the Chinese think we don&#39;t hate them for the benefit of the economic negotiations taking place this week.  It&#39;s no more of a conspiracy beyond the fact that China is conspiring to make itself a more dominant world player through their increasingly dynamic economy.</p>

<p>We are in (relatively) dire straits in the US, as far as our export/imports go, especially in regards to China.  We have played nice for a couple months, making it look like we don&#39;t dislike china, in order to facilitate a positive, and mutually beneficial relationship.  By May, these stories will be gone, replaced by &quot;Chinese political prisoners speak out&quot; etc. etc.</p>

<p>This is the problem with you conspiracy theorists.  You claim that you can see the big picture that nobody else sees, but you don&#39;t.  You see what you want to see and DO NOT see the big picture.  These are very very complex issues, and it IS alot easier to think that there is some big evil organization that is guiding all of this, just like it&#39;s easier for some people to believe in Creation rather than Evolution.  They can&#39;t wrap their minds around the concept, so they create an artificial construct within their own understanding.</p>

<p>China will wither and die without us.  We will wither and die without China.  Or relationship is antagonistic at times, but at it&#39;s heart, it is symbiotic. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t get what the big deal is. Amerikan/Israeli rule sucks, and China knows how to get shit done. Plus - the men are fucking hot, and the food is fucking awesome.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>soooooooo. You are telling me that freedom of speech is limited to</p>

<p>1) Pro China</p>

<p>2) Anti-Israel</p>

<p>3) Anti-government</p>

<p>4) Promoting Terrorism.</p>

<p>While we are asking Chinese government to grant free speech to Anti-Chinese speech in China.</p>

<p>Hypocrites. </p>
