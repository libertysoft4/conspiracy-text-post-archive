<p>I understand you got to do what you got to do, and I forgive you.  </p>

<p>Can&#39;t you sense the shift yet?  Isn&#39;t it time to let go?  Whatever human happens to read this, whoever is really behind that screen with a soul, can you please consider letting up?  How long do you really think it will be before the truth rises to the top anyways?  </p>

<p>A lie can only be supported by another lie; The Truth simply is.  Imagine the beauty when Humanity finally comes back to the truth.  You can give that back to them.  We will forgive you, I promise.  </p>

<p>I just want to thank you for what you do, because you have given those of us who are waking up to the truth meaning.  You are giving us meaning in our life so it is very easy to forgive you!  Honestly.  If there is any kind of &quot;revolution&quot; it will be a human revolution of love and peace, and it will be peaceful!  Just let go!  Let it all go.... there might be a couple bumps in the road but we are so close to freeing all of humanity.... </p>

<p>We are not all ignorant you know.  Some of us have managed to become educated while growing up very poor.  That is the amazing part of living in the year 2011!  There is really no need for this anymore.  We understand why things had to be hidden for a long time, we weren&#39;t educated enough to be ready.  But its starting to change.... Please, just let go.  </p>

<p>I love what you do, and I forgive you.</p>

<p>Maybe we should message him either way? :)</p>

<p>Do not forget in all of the infinite possibilities, the most likely truth , is he is a human.  Soon they&#39;ll have bots doing this type of shit and then its game over.  </p>

<p>Scratch that, they already have bots, but I doubt they are Watson Jeopardy level yet.  I think its time to start routing out the disinfo while we still can, I don&#39;t really care what the guy is.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I do truly have to agree with the original author of this topic, thank you. Without people repeating the same lies to the point of sounding ridiculous in their nonsensical repetition. To the point they even seem to &quot;CLING&quot; to those lies against simple explanations that make sense. And we &quot;conspiracy truthers&quot; would be just shouting empty remarks without the debate. While it may be informative, it does lack the 2 sided view that cause &quot;questioners&quot; to read on and view the links personally and discover the truth themselves and see how bad the lies are that are being spouted are. So in a way you are helping the truth by creating the argument to be shot down with truth and facts. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>We all have this information. The Internet is a great tool for chasing down facts. 10+ years ago a layman would never be able to educate himself like this without spending considerable time at libraries and such, which is just impractical for most people. </p>

<p>Considering how easy it is to find out the truth about things such as 9/11 in today&#39;s Internet age it&#39;s quite amazing that there are so many people who still believe in the insane 9/11 conspiracy theories like the &quot;controlled demolition&quot; theory. Oh well  :/</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, we all know about the internetz. Not to burst your bubble but the internet is propagating the ideas your against. The internet isn&#39;t always making it easier for everyone to believe in exactly the truth. That&#39;s a bit more human nature.</p>

<p>What I find quite amazing is that you are demonstrating such a low burden of proof for truth, such strong convictions about the issues, and most alarmingly such high confidence in government. For a skeptical mind 9/11 is not an easy subject to find out the exact truth about... That is unless you want to believe in whatever story you do.</p>

<p>On a side note truly thinking anybody who questions the official 9/11 story is anti-semitic reveals a lunatic mentality far more than not completely believing in it. Just calling it like I sees it, friend.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Give me a fucking break. I have never said that &quot;anybody who questions the official 9/11 story is anti-semitic&quot; you pathetic liar. The information about 9/11 is widely available. Much of it is in the <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiratard/comments/dc9tk/about_911/">Official 9/11 Thread at Conspiratard</a>. Scientific studies and the like are available to anyone with a computer and an internet connection. The fact that there are people with Internet access and tons of free time who actually believe in this &quot;inside job&quot; nonsense is remarkable. It&#39;s like they simply prefer being on the &quot;other&quot; side of an issue for the sake of being against the &quot;establishment&quot;, even if it means they are siding against the facts. It truly is remarkable that people like you exist, TheGrandMart. </p>

<p>I implore you right now to side with the truth and not with the 9/11 Truth Movement. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Really, pathetic liar... Pathetic insult from a desperate person; you&#39;ve got nothing. Did I say you said &quot;anybody who questions the official 9/11 story is anti-semitic&quot;, you hysterical little bitch? I&#39;ll answer for you because you&#39;ll just miss the point and say something off, no. If these are your best points don&#39;t bother responding. God knows I won&#39;t. You&#39;re spouting bullshit for lack of any argument at all. </p>

<p>Yes, some people are anti-authority. They will believe the &quot;other&quot; side because it fits emotionally for whatever reason. But you have no idea what I believe. With that being a fact it&#39;s bizarre you could find it remarkable people like me exist when people like me isn&#39;t defined. Side with the truth or what? Nothing... It&#39;s irrelevant.</p>

<p>Every time you say the information is widely available and no one has any reason to believe anything other than your story you&#39;re exposing yourself for what you are. I&#39;ll tell you again the information to the layman is not unequivocal, you pathetic liar. It never will be. Do you really think anybody falls for your stupid drivel? I doubt it. Believe what you want but even Bush and Ol&#39; Rummy wouldn&#39;t respect you, you lack question and independent thought. With all your conviction it makes you a dangerous idiot whether you&#39;re right or wrong . You&#39;ve shown everybody your thought process isn&#39;t to be trusted.</p>

YOU&#39;RE A REAL PIECE OF WORK TO BE ARGUING WITH PEOPLE LIKE A CONDESCENDING ASSHOLE ABOUT 9/11 AND TO NOT EVEN KNOW IT WOULD HAVE TAKEN A LONG TIME TO WRITE THE PATRIOT ACT.

Your black and white thinking on these issues is absolutely remarkable.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Do you remember the Cole bombing? Could it be that even if some version of the Patriot Act was drafted before Bush took office that it was in response to the numerous worldwide terrorist attacks that had been practically ignored? One thing that really sticks out is that George W Bush says in &quot;Decision Points&quot; that his Administration had some other name for the &quot;Patriot Act&quot; but that Congress came up with the PATRIOT Act acronym and changed the name of it. Your version says &quot;Patriot Act&quot; right at the top so it&#39;s not the pre-Bush Administration draft that you seem to be trying to say that it is. </p>

<p>So please show me the exact version of the Patriot Act that was submitted on Jan 3, 2001. This should be easy to find so go ahead and find it. I&#39;d like to know what changes were made to the bill after 9/11. I bet the changes are numerous. This could be quite a fruitful discussion after all. </p>

<p>I&#39;ll be waiting. </p>

That&#39;s your idiotic assumption in addition you&#39;re trying to stretch all this into me being a liar again! Pure craziness! I said different things... meaning, I didn&#39;t say the same thing.

Forgive you for trying to have the same conversation with two different people although my point is entirely different? <strong>YOU ARE NOT FORGIVEN</strong> &quot;You can&#39;t blame me for not really noticing you were a different person&quot; Yes I can. <strong>BLAME ATTRIBUTED</strong> Will your ridiculous antics ever end? I doubt it!</p>

<p>You want to counter me, go ahead and prove me unequivocally wrong. Really Champ, you&#39;re too much of a lunatic for me to bother with. <strong>DID YOU FORGET TO TAKE YOUR MEDS TODAY?</strong></p>

<p>&quot;I called you a liar because you were lying. I even proved that you were lying, you liar.
I&#39;m still waiting for the January draft of the PATRIOT Act.&quot;</p>

<p>There you go again! You only proved it in your own mind. I&#39;m glad you can see with no emotional interference and without getting your pride hurt what clearly goes on in the world.

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s way too ridiculous, but good for a laugh. We have common ground here. Your admitting that you&#39;re a hypocrite, right? You already know you fit the definition of a liar. See, I&#39;m only telling lies in that crazy teeny tiny little misshapen head of yours. If your &quot;proof&quot; is enough to truly convince you, no one should be trusting your judgement. I also feel sorry for you bothering like this. What your doing is obvious rationalization (Making excuses).</p>

<p>Let&#39;s move in for a closer look and recount your accusation. You want to hold me accountable for something I never said, but by association of one comment you declare me guilty and responsible. You declare that I am taking ownership (due to me laughing at your ignorance) of the exact details and point of what someone else said (even though I defined what I said differently in my same comment). There isn&#39;t any proof, buddy, just you being full of shit. The information was right there for you to see the difference, or ask (to avoid looking like a dumbass). You assumed and came out a dumbass. If you&#39;re not a bit nuts that would actually make you a liar; knowingly making up idiotic accusations. Or (back to crazy) maybe it&#39;s self delusion. </p>

<p>If you can&#39;t be right try, as hard as possible, to make yourself feel right, huh? Who am I kidding!? You probably believe deeply in your own bullshit. Possibly going so far as to be liberally smearing it under your nose regularly so you never have to know the difference. Everyone will always be wrong when you think they are, eh? You poor small small flaccid little man, jcm267. </p>

<p>Now let&#39;s look at two of your idiotic outright lies:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Did I say you said &quot;anybody who questions the official 9/11 story is anti-semitic&quot; Actually you did.</p></li>
<li><p>Oh yeah?? &quot;I&#39;ve never mentioned a January 2001 draft EVER. &quot; Here you go, liar: &quot;YOU&#39;RE A REAL PIECE OF WORK TO BE ARGUING WITH PEOPLE LIKE A CONDESCENDING ASSHOLE ABOUT 9/11 AND TO NOT EVEN KNOW IT WOULD HAVE TAKEN A LONG TIME TO WRITE THE PATRIOT ACT. IT WAS DRAFTED BEFORE 9/11 AS AN ABSOLUTE FACT&quot;</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Wait?!?! Whaaaa?!?! Where does it say January?!?! It doesn&#39;t!!! Ohh my Sweet Lord Jesus save me!!!!! You could have accepted my clarification for your benefit but you wanted to call me a liar instead. You chose to lose credibility. And you previously directly lied in the same manner! Why are you doing this to yourself?! It makes no sense. Are you going to start demanding information again? I refuse to argue it with you. Guess why... </p>

<p>Wait, you&#39;ll just fuck it up. I&#39;ll tell you. My point has been that the details about every facet of the events associated with 9/11 are not reliable or in some circumstances not even present. 10 years is not enough time for history to be reliable. How we understand 2001-present is still changing... You know because more information is coming out all the time... There are many different ideas concerning possible abuse and wrong doing that involve and use 9/11 (not just centered around it) that you don&#39;t know for certain what the fuck you&#39;re talking about when you claim all the information is out there for the layman to find. Especially not for you to be going around calling everyone crazy for not believeing exactly what you believe. There are some facts, but there is room for doubt. A sane person would admit there is doubt in a heartbeat, because a sane person doesn&#39;t believe himself to be omniscient. You can&#39;t bear to give an inch if you think you can get away with being a douche, even if you risk looking like an idiot (like right now), can you?</p>

<p>Arrogance goes to the man (jcm267) who claims he knows it all, and thinks he has the 100% correct opinion.</p>

I have reason to believe the date is forged, as explained in detail throughout this thread. </li>
<li>9/11 was carried out by Muslim terrorists with boxcutters and there is no reason to believe that the US government was involved or had sufficient knowledge of the plot to stop it </li>
<li>There was no &quot;controlled demolition&quot; at the World Trade Center on 9/11. There were controlled demolitions in the days following 9/11, when they &quot;pulled&quot; some severely damaged buildings to the ground with cables</li>
<li>Silverstein&#39;s &quot;pull&quot; term was referring to rescue teams, not a controlled demolition </li>
<li>There was no stand-down order issued </li>
<li>An airplane did in fact crash into the Pentagon</li>

I&#39;ll let you continue the truth here, oh.. bring up how Bin Laden&#39;s family was in Washington D.C. watching 9/11 unfold. Or how Bin Ladens #3 man had dinner at the pentagon a year after 9/11. Or how <strong>All</strong> the rebuilding plans started with the removal of &quot;building 7&quot; so it <em>conveniently &quot;fell down&quot;</em> LMAO &quot;fell&quot; thats funny ... <strong>imploded</strong></p>

<p>Keep up the good work.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>There was no stand down order </p></li>
<li><p>Please provide a link about this FAA regulation change and explain why it&#39;s relevant. The box cutters were legal and the long standing policy had been for those on board to not engage with terrorists. They turned off the transponders, making it hard to impossible to track down. Again, explanation needed here. </p></li>
<li><p>The Patriot Act was written after 9/11. </p></li>
<li><p>The whole White House was brought underground. This was the Secret Service&#39;s decision, not Bush&#39;s. </p></li>
<li><p>How do you know that they were aware that the Pentagon was a target? To me evacuating the Pentagon sounds like the ultimate &quot;stand down&quot; order!</p></li>
<li><p>Osama bin Laden didn&#39;t have any &quot;power&quot; in this country other than what his terrorist network was able to accomplish. </p></li>
<li><p>bin Laden&#39;s family is a very big one and they are not proud of him. Why, if this was a carefully planned &quot;inside job&quot;, would they choose a wealthy Saudi national whose relatives have ties to the US to be the scape goat? Why would they allow the Saudis to be on US soil during the attack? Why not use someone from Iraq or Afghanistan? Do you <em>ever</em> think about how this conspiracy theorist nonsense is such nonsense?</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/17617986/ns/us_news-security/">Google</a> tells me that it was none other than Khalid Sheikh Mohammed who was the &quot;number 3 guy&quot; at the time. Look at his history. From the Wikipedia entry on KSM: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khalid_Sheikh_Mohammed"><em>&quot;Khalid Sheikh Mohammed was secretly indicted on terrorism charges in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York in January 1996 for his alleged involvement in Operation Bojinka, and was subsequently placed on the October 10, 2001, initial list of the FBI&#39;s twenty-two Most Wanted Terrorists.&quot;</em></a>. Your theory is getting dumber by the minute. He was indicted in 1996 but was having dinner at the Pentagon in 2002, one year before he was captured and sent to Gitmo? Man, you&#39;re dumb!</p></li>

<li><p>Ummm yes <strong>Idiot</strong> it <strong>DID</strong> implode, :{to burst or collapse inward} The building IMPLODED, because it fell inside of its self, if it fell OVER it would be called a &quot;topple&quot; if it crashed sideways and leaned it would be called a collapse, but to &quot;collapse&quot; inward is known as imploding. </p></li>

<p>Anyways, I don&#39;t care if some insane people like Mike Gravel care calling for yet another investigation. There have been enough investigations. We know who did this and we know how. No amount of investigations will change the irrefutable fact that Muslim Terrorists -- and not Bush or Silverstein or Mossad -- were responsible for 9/11. </p>

<p>btw your precious &quot;keep me safe from freedom&quot; un-patriot act defines you as a terrorist also, thats why it was important enough to kill a few thousand on 9/11 to be sure it passes.

    <div class="md"><p>According to George W. Bush in <em>&quot;Decision Points&quot;</em> the name &quot;PATRIOT Act&quot; was conjured up by Congress and that his Administration had some other name for it until Congress changed it. How can we be so sure that this have been the original text from before Bush took office when it has the name that Congress gave to it after Bush was already President (see section 1, part a)? </p>

<p>What I can find <a href="http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/getdoc.cgi?dbname=107_cong_public_laws&amp;amp;docid=f:publ056.107.pdf">here</a> seems to have the same text verbatim except for the January 2001 part. I didn&#39;t go word for word but I looked at a few random sections. This suggests to me that your link might have a forged date</p>

<p>Please give me a <strong>credible</strong> link such as something from a .gov site or something to support your claim. </p>

<p>Thanks in advance!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>the link I gave is a credible source or they would have removed it, .. yes EXACTLY the wording IS pretty much the same, the govt is good at hiding these sources so as time goes on they become more scarce and I am VERY surprised that as informed you pretend to be you never heard of this fact ... since you are so behind here is another fact that has become difficult to prove but 4 years ago was a simple search (did it myself) on the FBI&#39;s own site, but most record of it has been altered: Fact up until 2006ish I personally looked around 2004 and Bin Laden was NOT on the FBI&#39;s most wanted list, he was wanted for questioning, but could NOT be put on the list without some evidence to his involvement to 9/11. But like I said around 2006 without introduction of new evidence he was put on the list, because it WAS a well known fact he wasnt on the list, and they slowly forced out the sites that showed this fact. But hey if you trust this government with your family have at it. Trust ONLY what they tell you and let me know how that works for the ones you love</p>

<p>Who is &quot;they&quot;? Answers.com? Really? Answers.com is not a remotely credible source. </p>

<p>bin Laden wasn&#39;t put on the FBI&#39;s Most Wanted list for 9/11 because this is not a criminal matter. George Bush rightly chose to treat 9/11 as an act of war. </p>

<p>You really need to stop being so wrong about everything. It&#39;s pathetic. The whole government isn&#39;t out to get you and that&#39;s what you&#39;re making this out to be. And yes it would take pretty much the whole government&#39;s involvement including folks in Congresss like Ron Paul to cover up this whole idea of yours that there was a version of the Patriot Act from before Bush was even President that is WORD FOR WORD the same thing as the final bill. </p>

<p>Now please post a <strong>credible</strong> source to support your claim. </p>

<p>...
.... 
**If that isnt a copy paste disinformationalists form response I cant imagine a better one ... lets break down this statement and the majority of your remarks here</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Bush <strong>Rightly</strong> --- extra key words to imply that Bush was unquestionably correct in his decision and how ... how did you word it in another of your posts ... basically &quot;your STUPID to question 9/11&quot; where-as here &quot;rightly so&quot; implies it towards Bush&#39;s &quot;OH SO INTELLIGENT&quot; (ROFLMFAO) investigative abilla lla lla tees to determine <strong>&quot;Rightfully&quot;</strong> that it wasnt a crime, not a police, not a judge, NO NO NO it was Jeb&#39;s slightly brighter brother <em>(facepalm)</em> ... </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Well I will give you this though, rightly he did know the whole plan, so he was WELL aware it was designed to look <strong>LIKE</strong> an </p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Act of War&quot;, in fact all above IS true so far .. <em>And to think Hillary Clinton (yes your boss) said, &quot;We need more money...we are losing the *</em>INFOWAR*<em>&quot; (rightly so, hehehe expect us always)</em></p>

<p><strong>credible</strong> --I will mainly ignore this (and stupid, and dumb and illiterate AND you dont know <strong>and</strong> all those other responses for documentation that <strong>Clearly</strong> demonstrates credible information. The last link I sent you proves that it was once on wikimedia but removed, a disinformationalist will say &quot;see it proves its a lie&quot; a truther knows it would have a <em>RETRACTION</em> not just removed .. therefore it was forced to be removed, like Department of Homeland (in)Security <strong>FORCED</strong> cable providers to go into customers DVR&#39;s and DELETE Governor Jesse Ventura&#39;s shows Police State, and JFK&#39;s assassination episodes specifically.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Search that one and <strong>PROVE</strong> to me with <strong>CREDIBLE</strong> information that DHS did <strong>not</strong> do that. If not then shut the fuck up about credible .gov sites (btw if you do happen to create ... find a site I&#39;ll just say its &quot;not credible&quot; ;-) I know how this works (I just have to spread the truth while showing how limited intellectually you are to comprehend simple information ... statistically most people start to wake up because of listening to others argue these points and find out for themselves so again thank you)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You really need to stop being so wrong about everything -- when you cant attack points, attack the person making them (common tactic for simple minds) I can at least point out the specific sentences that show yours ... I&#39;ll use this same quote as a good example. Sorry if your mind goes to the fallback when you run out of valid points to make. So I am wrong about Tonkin?? am I wrong about the USS Liberty?? about the underwear bomber being a CIA operation?? am I wrong about Black ops being caught transporting fissile material to Alqaeda in Pakistan? You <strong>DID</strong> say EVERYTHING didn&#39;t you.  <strong>Prove it with CREDIBLE evidence</strong> that I am <strong>Wrong</strong> on <strong>ANY</strong> one of these.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And dont even use Ron Pauls name!, you &quot;Bush is rightly guy&quot;... he knows and has spoken on Infowars about it a few times. I even gave you a link to famous quotes by <strong>Dozens</strong> of famous people speaking of this group <strong>YOU</strong> say doesnt exist. So am I supposed to believe <strong>YOU</strong> over Thomas Jefferson, or Benjamin Franklin, or JFK?? Wake up!!! You are the <strong>ONLY</strong> person mentioned in this reply that does not know the elite etched their utopia in a $1/2 million (in the 70&#39;s) monument <strong>Promising</strong> to maintain humanity under <strong>500,000,000</strong> so yes they are after you... and me and your family, if you dont care then stop reading and replying to truth threads, shove your head back up your arse and kiss em all good bye while you trust their servants (US Government). </p>

<p>If you trust them all so much check out what LBJ&#39;s first order as president was. Probably before JFK&#39;s body was even cold.</p>

<p>And thru all of this you are <strong>STILL</strong> completely fixated on a common knowledge, and used to be easily search-able, wikimedia and truth.org both published on this and instead or putting a page up stating that this story was retracted due to incorrect information or an apology for posting it. error 404 file not found. telling me they are being told to say nothing about it either way (makes it easier to keep a lie... pay attention you&#39;ll need this for your next promotion) </p>

<p>They even removed a congress woman&#39;s speech, Kudo&#39;s to your team, it does look like they were thorough in their censorship. This time you win, your turn, PROVE me wrong with CREDIBLE evidence on any of my other accusations. Start with the USS Liberty. Or the Bay/Gulf of Tonkin, or better yet... <strong>PROVE</strong> with <strong>CREDIBLE</strong> sources that a passenger aircraft struck the Pentagon. <strong>Proof</strong> that you would accept as credible <strong>WITHOUT</strong> using a major media site or a youaresuchadumbassforbelievingthisshit.gov site </p>

<p>Bring it bitch!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>wow you are fixated on the ONLY thing that I did not know that the evidence of has been removed for, (I did mention Kudo&#39;s to you and your teammates for being thorough) It does seem you knew full well that all those links were removed, but you guys forgot to post the retractions which is mandated, but since it was like the Pentagon video camera footage and classified &quot;National Security&quot; they couldnt retract it because it would prove the article existed. Like I said you&#39;ll need to know this for promotions, its easier to keep a lie if you dont acknowledge its existence. A retraction would have proven it did exist. And I PERSONALLY saw those documents about 6 years ago. </p>

<p>Now I gave you congrats on your focussing in on 1 thing now answer mine... <strong>PROVE</strong> to me a &quot;passenger turbine driven aircraft&quot; hit the Pentagon!! I can settle this right here, because if you cant then the <strong>WHOLE</strong> 9/11 comes under suspicion. Credible ONLY stupididiotswillbelieveanything.gov does not count. Because I am not gullible enough to believe ANYTHING those rotten stealing taxing child raping bastards say. Must be why you want that promotion, its the pedo stuff you want to get to isnt it? Study your lies well and some day maybe.. lmao they&#39;ll eat you first idiot. <em>Yet he will continue ...facepalm</em> </p>

<p>Come on 1 video that <strong>SHOWS</strong> this passenger jet that over 100 <strong>PROFESSIONAL</strong> pilots state They couldn&#39;t hit the building at that angle speed and direction, and declares that some noob with a few hours in a private aircraft is &quot;ridiculous&quot; ... there have also been a few dozen simulaters runs a few by a flight instructer <strong>NONE</strong> could hit it, closest was 1/2 <strong>mile</strong> short, next closest was 2 <strong>miles PAST</strong> good luck with your <strong>EVIDENCE</strong> Shouldnt be too hard there were 5 cameras on that side of the pentegon, and multiple video cameras on nearby buildings to catch it all clearly! </p>

<p>p.s. the 3 pics you will rely on show NO plane, just an explosion...</p>

<p>IF this is <strong>too tough</strong> :( try one of the other points. </p>

<p>And yes dumbass Ben Franklin was way older, but he speaks of the same group back then, the Constitution was <strong>Designed</strong> to stop this group, but they have chipped away at it soo much they can now steal trillions quadrillions and there is little we can do to save ourselves from their tyranny, and your trying to help them will not work. &quot;Those who give up personal liberties for temporary security deserve neither&quot; ~Ben Franklin he knew how these crooks worked they stopped them, but ever since 1779 they have been working on this for their childrens children ... they dont think like you do. They have taught you to think about <strong>Your</strong> retirement, and not your kids, or theirs. The rich do, they plan and plan and plan, strategies covert deception. Then when they take complete control to wipe out terrorists. ANY infraction can be used to declare YOU a terrorist. &lt;---Is why 9/11 HAD to happen for them. No not 2,000 Afghan people. Well good luck, I give up on finding anything but threads with deleted links for the &quot;Original&quot; date of this miraculously contrived 4000 page law that was written miraculously fast and thorough, in 3 weeks (sure there is an easter bunny relax)</p>

<p>So you&#39;re crazier than Jeff Rense and Alex Jones. Congrats. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>forgive the neocons too  man.  i mean obviously let the truth be known.  speak the truth endlessy.  but forgive them. </p>

<p>honestly, i suspect the key to beating these &quot;devils&quot; we have built up is to forgive them.  they will get theres completely on its own simply but speaking the truth over and over and allowing freedom to exist in all things, including freedom in debate, and dare i say, freedom to manipulate people into your point of view.  </p>

<p>people need to wake up, manipulation is a variable in the universe as constant as gravity.  its not a paranoid statement its the facts of life.  i cant even tell you i love you without the contradiction coming out the other side that i&#39;m trying to control you in a way with that love.  </p>

<p>even in freedom there is contradictions.  maybe we are about to learn a new nuance to the word &quot;freedom&quot;.</p>

<p>and just to clarify, i&#39;m not a christian.  i&#39;m an agnostic.  believe nothing.  keep your mind fresh.  keep your mind growing. </p>

<p>a lie is only supported by a lie.  the truth simply is.  we have never needed anything other than to find the truth.  thats it.  </p>

<p>could the biggest game of all be to turn the concept of forgiveness into a dogmatic bullshit superstious religion?  its never been about religion its never been about christ, the dude doesnt even need to exist. its about truth its about love thats it.</p>

<p>we dont even know what exists anyway if you are real with yourself and that ain&#39;t some existentialism.  be real with yourself.</p>

<p>we all have a personal belief system in addition to the one that we face the world with.  those of us who are awake know that we can&#39;t just go out telling people what we believe lest we want to have no ability to share in <em>form</em> ation.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The most poetic of questions, free will.  I&#39;ve always believed in it as a useful belief system as it empowers but again obviously it is just another contradiction.  </p>

<p>Am I using it?  Have I ever been?  My life is so miraculous.  How could I tell who&#39;s will this really was?  It has been a revealed mystery.  It has been beautiful.  Free will is probably the last illusion to go.  I feel it slipping.  I am also ready to serve but I don&#39;t know what I&#39;m serving other than a few abstract concepts of Truth and Goodness...and intuition.  These concepts seem good enough to get the universe this far, I&#39;m willing to serve them into infinity.  </p>

<p>I really ought not to have allowed myself to feel so good and become so manic that I start screwing up my grammar and etc.  But its Day 1.5 of no sleep.  Ah well, I have tested those limits before and I am not pushing them any further.  </p>

<p>I&#39;m afraid to ask because all of my truth will now be colored with a belief and many will tune out, but I feel I have written my story here.  This has been a heck of a day of posts.  But I need some help getting to bed so I don&#39;t push this good feeling a bit too far into a state of mania and become a Charlie Sheen without the drugs.  </p>

<p>Would you mind praying for me?  I&#39;m willing to believe it will make a difference.  I just need some sleep right now, badly.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Modify it for your own use.  This is just how I personally feel.  Remove whatever part you feel is too much hippy bullshit.  </p>

<p>I have studied Alchemy, Taoism, Zen Buddhism, Christianity, Hinduism.  I have concluded the key to healing your own mind is to merge the two opposite concepts. </p>

<p>As rational as you believe you might be, there is a part of your psyche that is absurdly irrational, and if you don&#39;t believe me, check your dreams for an example.  You can either work to program it or leave the programming of it to chance.  I have actively redefined all symbols and semantics in my  mind to pick the belief system I think most usefully serves me.  I have concluded the  most useful belief would be to respect the &quot;devil&quot;, the &quot;dark side&quot; if you will, but not to identify with him.  </p>

<p>I believe the most useful belief would be to try to heal the concept of &quot;Devil&quot; by loving and forgiving it.  Note the difference between love and worship.  In no way should you worship the dark side, only love it. </p>

<p>Don&#39;t think of loving it in a romantic sense ; think of loving it as a mother loves its terrible black sheep child in its large human family.  Even Charles Manson had a mother.      </p>

<p>I have chosen to believe we are all part of one big human family more or less.  It seems to be the belief system that most serves me.  Don&#39;t listen to my preachy hippy shit, find the belief system that you think most serves you.  You might want to think long and hard first on what the most useful defintion of &quot;you&quot; is first, or from your first person point of view, &quot;I&quot;.   </p>

<p>Define - &quot;Who Am I&quot;
then define the rest of your beliefs</p>

<p>And you will have programmed your mind as if it were a computer.  Your mind is already programmed, whether you like it or not, it has to be to have some parameters to work within.</p>

<p>My mind is programmed as well.  I am not some sort of savior or cult figure.  I have just worked hard at actively consciously defining my belief system.  I am quite sure I still have some glitches of my own, but this current message of peace and love resonates strongly right now in march of 2011 for me.</p>

<p><em>In developmental psychology - particularly analytical psychology - individuation is the process through which a person becomes his/her &#39;true self&#39;. Hence it is the process whereby the innate elements of personality; the different experiences of a person&#39;s life and the different aspects and components of the immature psyche become integrated over time into a well-functioning whole. Individuation might thus be summarised as the stabilizing of the personality.</em></p>

<p>that is just one mask i  put on .  i can easily put on the paranoid mask and see what you are saying is true.  it is, i have studied political theory decently well in an academic sense AND have studied it extensively in a paranoid sense.  i can contrast both views to each other and you are absolutely right about slicing and dicing up people into about 3 distinct categories of how they are going to view these escalating revolutions.  </p>

<p>let me ask you, since i am capable of seeing shit your way, you care to try my view on for size , just for a second, even if its not &quot;true&quot;?  just imagine it like you would a unicorn or dragon or something man, and see how it feels.  you dont have to believe any of it, my view isnt true, its just some idealistic shit one can achieve if they choose to.  maybe you dont think my philosophy is useful but the way im&#39; feeling today...it feels pretty damn useful.  </p>

<p>you are more than welcome to your paranoid view if you feel it serves you.  no doubt we are going to need some paranoid people to get us through these upcoming times.  all i&#39;m suggesting is, ask yourself is that view really serving you?  is it empowering you?  ultimately theres certain things we havent been able to empower ourselves with, namely, ive never met anybody who can survive death yet.  so i dont believe anyone who tries to sell me a solution.  and i&#39;m tired of fear, theres no point.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>you are there dude.  i wonder how many are awake and building their symbols?  </p>

<p>if you are open to it, here is my advice to encourage more to start doing it</p>

<p>keep doing what you do with interjecting things like <em>this</em> circuit and then </p>

<p>&quot;no seriously&quot;</p>

<p>right....predict their reaction then quickly plant the proper response</p>

<p>but then let them know you are doing it as you are doing it.  </p>

<p>if you use NLP / this type of hypnotic technique when talking to people, you will open them up more and more to the fact that you are in fact manipulating them and then they will in turn trust you more and more.  the problem with a of these NLP magicians of which i have gotten the sense that you are one (forgive me if came to this conclusion irrationally, i was on 2 days no sleep yesterday, finally got some sleep!) , the problem is too often they do not tell the patient that they are implanting new ideas.</p>

<p>as for your idea of trying to steer me away from going to a place where entropy exists in reverse, i think that is a fascinating perspective on it and i suspect it is true.  but i don&#39;t see how that is &quot;bad&quot; , i think it is a world where the same games have to be played so i&#39;m sure it is &quot;bad&quot; in some sense but it is also most likely beautiful in many senses..... </p>

<p>at any rate, since the only belief i have chosen to take on is truth;  i know that arriving at <em>that</em> circuit.... is inevitable.  i&#39;m tired of covering it up.</p>

<p>your impression is accurate. I do what I can. I learned by <em>myself,</em> btw. Alone, with no references. I absolutely do not condone trusting this process to any New Age belief system. They are all traps.</p>

<p>you seem to have misunderstood. There is an elaborate trap laid by the world for people like you and I. It leads to death. There&#39;s only one way out of it, which you have said relies on one-dimensional communication and instantiates a closed loop. My response is that <em>this</em> loop, in particular, is open, because the one-dimensional pathway leads to a place where entropy, as it turns out, is backwards. Infinity. Not in some abstract, conceptual sense, either, but <em>literally.</em> Heaven. Far beyond this plane. I am an advocate of this particular one-dimensional pathway.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/cs6xg/anyone_else_in_the_process_of_waking_up/c0uucnk">this series of posts seeks to explain said pathway in much greater detail.</a></p>

<p>Basically, they aren&#39;t getting any new exposure from the &quot;Google bombs.&quot; According to Alexa, traffic has not increased any faster since they started.  No normal person knows Google Trends even exists, while at the same time millions of people are using Google News, where Infowars content has been removed... in response to gaming Google Trends.  It&#39;s ineffective at best and counterproductive at worst.</p>
