    <div class="md"><p>What I meant by theoretical is really how people imagined Communism before they tried it. As I understand it, the political ideology involves spreading the labor based on individual skill sets. That is not what this is at all. Labor is voluntary. Machines and computers are our bitches, and there is no elite. This is to avoid a scenario where a small number of very rich and powerful people control these same machines and computers, as well as the starving masses who are now at their will. It is a solution for the future more than an idea to create a Utopian society, which characterizes Communism.</p>

<p>Your other question is about violence. Can you please elaborate, because I&#39;m not sure I understand what you are asking -- how is violence necessary to make this transition? We will simply say sorry, wealthiest 1%, your money is no longer good. That&#39;s all there really is to it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Nobody has an obligation to do anything. Step one is getting everyone what they need to survive. There are more than enough people in the world willing to help that there is plenty of room for laziness. I think that, when combined with modern technology, there are also more than enough volunteers to cover deployment of the latter stages. </p>

<p>The fact that technology has advanced so far and is advancing so fast is a big part of this, but it is also that when the burden of survival and needing to earn money are lifted, people become much more likely to volunteer their time for the good of mankind.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Again, this is not Communism, even if the conversation keeps getting steered in this direction. I understand the inclination to seek historical precedent, but in this case it does not exist. </p>

<p>People are free to be lazy. The resource-based economy is built around the idea that rapidly advancing technology is increasingly allowing multinational corporations to reap massive profits at the expense of both Americans and humanity. The argument is quite simply that this technology should be working directly for the planet and its people as opposed to being under the control of private interests who will/are using it as leverage for economic slavery.</p>

<p>Again, volunteer load only has to make up the gap not filled by advanced technology and extremely efficient manufacturing (building for EVERYONE instead of only a small percentage of the population) and new manufacturing techniques (such as Cradle to Cradle specifications which allow for perpetual <em>true recycling</em> of raw material in the technosphere).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s not communism at all.
in fact this point is a crucial motivator in people&#39;s opposition/lack of understanding to the project.</p>

<p>&quot;Communism being similar to a resource-based economy or The Venus Project is an erroneous concept. Communism has money, banks, armies, police, prisons, charismatic personalities, social stratification, and is managed by appointed leaders. The Venus Project&#39;s aim is to surpass the need for the use of money. Police, prisons and the military would no longer be necessary when goods, services, healthcare, and education are available to all people. The Venus Project would replace politicians with a cybernated society in which all of the physical entities are managed and operated by computerized systems. The only region that the computers do not operate or manage is the surveillance of human beings. This would be completely unnecessary and considered socially offensive. A society that uses technology without human concern has no basis of survival. Communism has no blueprint or methodology to carry out their ideals and along with capitalism, fascism, and socialism, will ultimately go down in history as failed social experiments.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have looked into this a lot. Unfortunately, whenever you try to pin down a supporter, or even Jacques Fresco himself, on how you get from here to there, the answer has no details. So, let&#39;s stop pussy-footing around and get to them shall we? This is <em>MY</em> proposal of how <em>I</em> think it could happen. If anyone can improve upon it feel-free:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Make people aware of the distorted values reinforced by our culture. Greed, corruption, laziness, apathy, etc are not default human attributes. They are the result of our profoundly sick environment to which I am happily maladjusted.</p></li>
<li><p>Help people who want to work towards realizing this movement remove themselves from the wage-slave paradigm.</p></li>
<li><p>Promote a (free) system for relevant education (logic, computer science, engineering, chemistry, robotics, construction, recycling, metallurgy, agriculture, architecture, mathematics, philosophy, nano-technology, etc)</p></li>
<li><p>Collect resources (&quot;trash&quot;, recycling, land, renewable energy, etc)</p></li>
<li><p>Destroy markets by providing goods and services for free and promoting strategic boycotts. Once the current system no longer satisfies the profit-addicted capitalists, they may be more open to alternatives.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Yes, I think the majority of the work will fall on those in the early stages of the movement, but when you compare that work with what most people are used to today (meaningless wage-slavery, the profits of which go to a few elite) I think many people will gladly offer their time.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The reason I used the term &quot;humane&quot; is that our current system, by design, is inhumane. When money is created out of debt there must always be a loser. We are thrown into violent competition with one another and thus, as long as this current system is in place, there will always be losers and winners. </p>

<p>Why is our current system inhumane? Look at any of the <em>majority</em> of Earth residents who are living in desperate poverty. Why should anyone go without clean water? Why should anyone be hungry? Why should anyone be without shelter? Why do we have to pay to live on a planet we were born on, even when we have no way of making these payments?</p>

<p>We have the resources to secure humane living conditions for every inhabitant of Earth; it is only the artificial monetary system created above our true resource supply that prevents this from happening. When everyone&#39;s most basic needs are taken care of, populations will stabilize. People will be free to contribute to humanity in whatever way they see fit. We can end the insane downward spiral we have found ourselves in.</p>

<p>According to the knowledge that I have right now, I believe that resource-based economy is our best solution. It&#39;s only a theoretical belief system based on the knowledge I have at this time. I do not allow myself to be controlled by my own need to be right, and that is how I have gotten to where I am now.</p>

For example we need surgeons today, but robotics is advancing at such a pace that machines will be able to perform most surgery within this century. Also within this century, we could have manufacturing plants in our living rooms that require only raw material and human-designed (or not?) schematics.

    <div class="md"><p>I love the idea of a resource-based economy, the system we have now is failing us at an alarming rate. But I believe to barter for goods is the only way this will work. Humans will need to have pride and a sense of ownership to keep doing what they are doing. By default humans will have pride in being the one&#39;s who have the steel, the pineapples, the cotton fields, etc. We don&#39;t need to go so far with technology to the point it makes us useless, unprotected in a changing world. It&#39;s all about balance. I think we need to rethink our impact even technology is having on the human society and on earth. And trust me I love me some technology!

    <div class="md"><p>Well you really can&#39;t have it both ways. Perhaps you can, but not with the resource-based economy concept. Bartering could still take place for things like collectable items, art, or anything with some sort of sentimental value. As for goods with utility, well, the whole point is that there is no longer a &quot;price tag&quot; attached, whether that be currency or other goods and services.</p>

<p>You can&#39;t really picture this being reality while people are still the same way they are today. In <em>A People&#39;s History of the United States</em>, Howard Zinn describes the peaceful Arawat indians before Columbus and his men landed on their shores. The Arawats and other tribes in the West Indies were peaceful and at one with their environment. They had no concepts of ownership over the land, the resources, or each other. Had they not been immediately enslaved they would have openly shared everything they had with the Europeans, just as they did with each other. Within a decade or two, though, they had been slaughtered by the monster we now celebrate once a year. Disease, murder, and an overall destruction of their habitat and culture caused mass death; millions upon millions fell until there was nothing left of a once almost perfect society. </p>

<p>The prideful, greedy hoarders we are today is not the natural human condition. It is only a product of the environment we have been a part of for our entire lives.</p>

<p>How do you propose we create this &quot;resource-based economy&quot;?

    <div class="md"><p>There would need to be some sort of central world governance.

    <div class="md"><p>I think that saying it&#39;s just about currency is an oversimplification. Eliminating the monetary system is just a means to an end. The point is (1) to put a stop to the needless suffering and plight of our fellow man that we have become so desensitized to and (2) to deconstruct the current pyramidal world power structure led by a tiny number of wealthy elites who have unfairly gained control of the world and the wealth.</p>

<p>For one, if you&#39;re serious about grasping the concept don&#39;t encapsulate the entire projects philosophy into one individuals understanding of it. </p>

<p>If you want to dispute the project, then do some research and present your issues. If you&#39;d like to dispute one individuals interpretation, then keep going as you have been.</p>

<p>Furthermore, No one wants you to &#39;sign up&#39; to anything.
This is an open discussion regarding social change, not a pyramid scheme, no one stands to profit from your inclusion in the discussion.</p>

<p>Now as I said, if you actually want answers to your questions, they&#39;re as easy to find as a trip to google.
However seeing as you&#39;re so incredibly opposed to doing any external research of your own, I&#39;ve gone and done it for you. (aren&#39;t I nice?) :P</p>
