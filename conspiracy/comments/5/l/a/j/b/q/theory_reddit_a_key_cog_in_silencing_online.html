        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Ok, so I&#39;m very new to reddit. Ive known of its existence for many years but never honestly gave it the time of day and realized how many people actually use it daily. I probably started reading religiously sometime back in Sept/Aug. </p>

<p>I originally stumbeled upon r/TheDonald, and then r/Conspiracy and r/AlternativeHistory and got hooked. Ive been reading post after post daily, mostly in r/Conspiracy, and decided yesterday to join literally for this exact post (although I plan to hang around and eventually venture into less depressing subreddits like Gaming/Sports/etc).</p>

<p>Getting to my point, even in the last few months that Ive been scouring r/Conspiracy and other subreds, Ive noticed Conspiracy has definitely changed. While I fully expected places like r/Pol and TheDonald to be somewhat (understandably) biased, the general consensus Ive gotten across many posts and posters is that these subs have changed also. My theory is that this was strategically done to effectively nullify true dissidents and genuine researchers into real conspiracys. Hear me out (and before you hear this theory, please know I personally am politically neutral. I dont play the game. Trump, Clinton, Obama...theyre all on the same team as far as Im concerned.)</p>

<ol>
<li><p>r/Pol becomes so overly liberal that its not a genuine political forum. Theres not any actual genuine political talk going on over there.</p></li>
<li><p>r/TheDonald is the opposite side of the same coin, honestly. However, too many people started connecting real dots and making real connections. Thats not to say frequent &quot;liberal-leaning&quot; posters in r/Pol are all incapable of following some bread crumbs to real truth. But its pretty obvious there are way more political dissidents realizing the true reach of the TPTB amongst &quot;Trump supporters&quot; than the other side. Hence the alt-right/New Age Nazi/White supremacist narrative. Sure, there were some who are actual bigots who posted a lot in TheDonald, but just as many were likely plants. Ive noticed people in this sub can at least spot a blatant shill from a mile away. Some others are not so obvious.</p></li>
<li><p>So end result of these two sub-reddits is theyre now overly censored and effectively dead. Any posters looking to make actual, unbiased contributions have migrated or left reddit all together (people moving to voat, etc)</p></li>
<li><p>Which leads to this sub-reddit being changed as well. The ultimate end result is the &quot;destruction&quot;, if you will, of these other two subs becoming blatantly, overly censored (with a specific agenda in mind) is r/Conspiracy has now become a political sub as opposed to a sub dedicated to researching real conspiracy.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>I mean, just look at the top posts in this sub everyday. Those who control this site have taken advantage of the societal programming instituted by the TPTB and applied it strategically to different subs. Whether theyre initial goal was to &quot;kill three birds with two stones&quot; I couldnt tell you.</p>

<p>I may be rambling, and Im doing this from a phone, but my basic point is this: we&#39;ve all been duped into destroying this sub because of over-censoring in two other politically charged subs.</p>

<ol>
<li>No real political talk in r/Pol.</li>
<li><p>Some Trump supporters who frequently visited r/TheDonald have moved to conspiracy. While with genuine intentions of uncovering real truth and crippling the TPTB, many have become brainwashed into the idea that Trump is a genuine human being who is here to help us. This has effectively leaned this sub slighty to the right when it should be completely politically unbiased (This is supposed to be the sub where everyone realizes political parties and politicians are all out to fuck us. This is the part where many of you attack me because Im a new account and call me a shill.)</p></li>
<li><p>End result is r/Conspiracy is now basically a polticial sub more than it is a sub researching real conspiracy.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>I believe this was strategically done, thoughts?</p>

<p>(With all that being said, let me say those investigating PizzaGate/Clinton Foundation/Tavistock/TPTB in general, thank you for all your hard work. And to any I may have offended because of your political views, I apologise. The point of this post is simply to point out there are powers at work who never stop trying to divide us anyway they can to stop us from discovering real truth, which at the very least is what this sub should be all about)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ultimately I think that is what Reddit is trying to do with this sub.  Flood it with politically charged content and make it look like every other political sub.  The very nature of r/conspiracy is to reject the political charade and look behind the curtain.  By flooding this sub with political junk it makes it appear as though this sub adheres to the two party system.  It&#39;s an attempt to censor critical thinkers and more in depth discussions.  I honestly do not think their efforts will be successful.  Our skepticism runs deep and I do not think true subscribers to this sub are wavered in the least.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yup I was a big reader on the Donald who is spending much more time here lately. I voted trump but have my doubts, I never considered myself much of a conspiracy theorist but I keep coming back here bc it&#39;s one of the few remaining places online with critical thinkers. A couple other places come to mind but if anyone wants to PM me their other usual spots I&#39;d love to have somewhere else to go once this place gets overrun with shills. </p>

<p>When I started coming here this sub reflected exactly that. There are so many politically motivated conspiracies that I feel are missing the big picture. Gone from occupy wall street to the radical left and radical right dominating the narrative.</p>
