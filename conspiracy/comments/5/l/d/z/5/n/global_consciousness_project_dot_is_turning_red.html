    <div class="md"><p>haha, good timing! We are <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/5le83l/input_requested_who_else_has_been_seeing/">sharing over here</a>. </p>

<p>There has been some huge feeling of well being, an insatiable thirst for knowledge and understanding. Seeing between the lines of just about as much as my brain can handle. </p>

<p>Honestly I&#39;ve never felt so connected to the Earth than now. Harmony and peace. My dreams have been restless and keep me from getting a deep sleep, my dreams are highly active. I used to be able to sleep 4 hours and function (this has been since infancy, my poor mother lol) but now it&#39;s not the case...I find myself needing more, like I&#39;m running a mental marathon daily and trying to digest knowledge. </p>

<p>I see a lot of people feeling this, like we all feel alive. Feeling free</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ha, I started both of these threads.  I&#39;m so glad people are sharing, because honestly, waking up is terrifying.  Part of me wants to go back to sleep, but it&#39;s like cramming a 10x10 box into a 2x2 box.  It doesn&#39;t work.  I feel strongly I need to quit my dead-end corporate day job, though - or that I am going to &quot;miss something.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Keep listening and feeling for signs and signals the world is sending us. Obviously something is going on that is bigger than all of us, there&#39;s so many of us that this is beyond coincidence, right?</p>

<p>It was suggesting to me not to wake anyone up from the matrix that doesn&#39;t want to be woken up. If they&#39;re in the matrix, let them be. The truth finds those who want to find the truth.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve been thinking of finding a new job, significant enough to help out (I work for &quot;Evil corp&quot; right now.), so again we are on the same wavelength.</p>

<p>We just keep doing our thing! Along the lines, you find people who are out of the matrix, we can share and experience life together with. The rest, well it&#39;s not our job to wake anyone up. This is literally not something we should do. Throw down breadcrumbs and suggestions, help stir up the hornets nest occasionally. If they want to take that blue pill and fall back asleep, well there must be a reason for that. </p>

<p>Stay strong, thanks for the post, it&#39;s really cool to see what is happening amongst a collective!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes. Have never been more awake and aware than these last few weeks, I have noticed a huge change in myself, though I am not sure I have noticed an observable change in those around me. Is anybody noticing others around them awakening? I certainly am having a feeling that a shift is happening, but I am not sure I am observing it much in those around me specifically. Any personal observations of friends or family awakening recently?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Both my wife and I for the past few months have been seemingly drawn to make major life changes.  We pulled out son from school and decided to homeschool him, and she quit her job to do this.  I am also going to be leaving mine to pursue my &quot;side job&quot; as a full time job.  The 11:11 &quot;wake up calls&quot; seem to be pulling me to pull the trigger, as it were.   I seem to be looking inside myself more and more often and evaluating my &quot;service to self&quot; VS. &quot;service to others&quot; mentality, and desperately wanting to transition to the latter; there feels like there&#39;s a sense of urgency about it.  </p>

<p>I also felt compelled to forgive my twin brother after years of avoiding him.  He went what I thought was crazy in 2012, claiming he was a starseed and on a mission.  And then he began a series of lawsuits against companies that had violated privacy rights and ended up with nearly $750,000 USD in the bank.  It raised my eyebrows: <a href="http://archive.jsonline.com/news/wisconsin/professional-plaintiff-uses-credit-law-to-threaten-companies-win-230000-in-settlements-b99748699z1-384400481.html">http://archive.jsonline.com/news/wisconsin/professional-plaintiff-uses-credit-law-to-threaten-companies-win-230000-in-settlements-b99748699z1-384400481.html</a></p>

<p>And of late, I&#39;ve been wondering if he was right... his exploitation of the companies he sued allowed him to quit his day job and write a book called RABYLON, which is a LAW OF ATTRACTION and MAGIC MONEY SYSTEM story masked as a children&#39;s story.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not the same thing at all, or anywhere close.  In my brother&#39;s case, the companies clearly violated a plainly-stated, although totally stupid, law.  The case you&#39;re referring to involves a conman ramping up charges.  My brother has never accused anyone of doing him emotional harm; he has threatened to turn his suits into class-action lawsuits, and because the companies know they broke the law - again, a stupid, unnecessary law to begin with - they give him a fairly large settlement to go on his way and never bring it up again.</p>

<p>In my brother&#39;s mind, this was presented to him as the Universe&#39;s method of &quot;righting wrongs&quot; and quickly accumulating the funds he needed to begin his plan.</p>

<p>I do not agree with how he generated the money.  But he sued companies such as GREAT LAKES EDUCATIONAL LOAN and TIME-WARNER, which are both run by globalist pigs drowning in bad karma.  Also, these companies have insurance policies that protect them against these kinds of things, so they&#39;ll never actually foot the bill for the total expenses.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not certain two wrongs make a right, and my own thoughts are that we need to extend olive branches to our enemies, and forgive them.  It is the only way to go: take the high road. </p>

<p>What I don&#39;t get is how you think this character from the Ukraine is a star seed.... no where is it mentioned that this person thought he was a starseed. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>What your brother is doing is the exact same.  This is a common get rich quick scheme.  Just exploiting legal loopholes. You may think it exploits only the &quot;globalist pigs&quot; etc.  But you&#39;re wrong -- it hurts all of us.  An eye for an eye makes the whole world blind -- you are self proclaimed as being &quot;woke&quot; &amp; i am just a blind nobody so what do i know though.  If you&#39;re brother really cares he could donate all the proceeds from these frivilous 1 trick pony lawsuits to charity but he&#39;s only in it for the personal gain... That&#39;s not genuine or of any sort of light.  What he is doing is dark &amp; so are some of your comments.  Prince of darkness is here disguising himself as light.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I am 100% certain it is not medical.  I have experienced no pain or negative symptoms.  Other than being tired, which is totally explainable in lieu of my present circumstances.  I do not feel threatened by the tremors; they seemed innocuous enough, in fact, that I just rolled onto my back and went back to sleep.   </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Indeed, I am.  That&#39;s why I&#39;m posting on this.  Got majorly redpilled after 9/11 and have been in quiet opposition to TPTB from behind-the-scenes for the past 10 years.  Just recently have been seeing a lot of 555&#39;s and 11:11&#39;s and 12:12&#39;s. </p>

<p>And I&#39;ve been noticing strange vibrations in the area of my chest as I&#39;m sleeping, which are abrupt enough to force me to change position.  They don&#39;t hurt; they&#39;re just... unusual, like a train is going by near my home, except I live in a rural area.</p>

<p>Have been getting drawn to a lot of information lately regarding the nature of the earth and its history, and haven&#39;t been able to &quot;prove&quot; anything, but feel in my heart that what I&#39;m learning is true.</p>

<p>I read the Ra Material in the past 72 hours (<a href="http://www.lawofone.info/">http://www.lawofone.info/</a>) as well as the Hidden Hand dialogue (<a href="http://www.illuminati-news.com/00363.html">http://www.illuminati-news.com/00363.html</a>).</p>

<p>Then I came across Corey and the Sphere Being Alliance (<a href="http://spherebeingalliance.com/">http://spherebeingalliance.com/</a>) which sounds bananas, but for some odd reason rings of truth to me.</p>

<p>There are a lot of correlations between the material.</p>

<p>And then I was drawn to the music of the band Starset, which is linked to this mysterious group the Starset Society, which apparently has a message about high tech that / disclosure that is going to be released soon.  Starset&#39;s 2nd album - perhaps not coincedentally - is released on Inauguration Day, 1/20/17. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Wow... I relate with your post in so many ways. First, the other day I was doing yoga and felt a huge surge of energy just beaming out from my chest (something I have never felt anywhere in my body before, nor did I ever think was something a person could feel). Also, I have been very into the Earth&#39;s &quot;story&quot; and our purpose/origin/reality lately. I feel as though I &quot;know&quot; things about who we are and why we are here that I have no concrete way of explaining or proving, but &quot;know&quot; within myself so deeply. And, I also have been getting into the Corey Goode sphere being alliance stuff for the past week or so. That&#39;s something I wouldn&#39;t necessarily even be interested in normally, but upon reading a bunch of it, something about it resonates deeply with me as well, as if a lot of it is stuff I already &quot;know.&quot; </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I felt several cold sensations, where it felt like fingers running up my back, followed by goosebumps all over, always triggered while espousing a certain thing I&#39;d just discovered which I was sharing with my spouse or friends.  And I&#39;ve felt what can best be described as &quot;rushes of energy&quot; where my eyes seemed almost... I don&#39;t know how to explain this... &quot;more open&quot; / alive... </p>

<p>I work 3rd shift at a call center and never get enough sleep, and I am virtually addicted to caffeine supplements to make it through my shifts.  Trust me when I say I am not usually one to have pep in my step.  This feeling is like a wave of warmth washing over me, and energizing from within.  </p>

<p>It doesn&#39;t last forever, but every time it&#39;s happened, it&#39;s last for I&#39;d say 15-20 minutes, and is usually followed by a very productive, creative thinking session.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You clearly need to seek healing, big-time.  Your energies are blatantly hostile and regressive.  You are fixated on negative frequencies and fearful.  Dare I say, gloating, about you &quot;knowing this&quot; and others not.  I am fully aware there is spiritual warfare going on, but making it out to be &quot;worse than anything ever&quot; is downplaying our own psychic abilities to change it all in a heartbeat if we choose to.  And the veil is coming down.  If you think of evil, you&#39;ll get more of it.  People are good, and we have been deceived, but we are waking up. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t know if you&#39;re joking or not, but I have just recently discovered the simulated/holographic universe theory and was fascinated by it. The deeper you search and learn the more you find out the greatest minds are intrigued by it. The double slit experiments and the nature of matter when it&#39;s observed or unobserved and the breakdown of universal constants at the quantum level. We may be a simulation, a valid and all encompassing explanation. Mind blown.</p>

<p>This lead me to the whole train of thought some express that the mind simply sees reality as it wants, and we are the projectors of reality, and the mind of humanity is a sort of hive mind that is projecting it together, waves become matter and coalesce around us experiencing it. Another mind blower. Just tonight the whole reincarnation thing was my search of choice. There is something there in that realm of thought that coincides with the simulated universe and the quantum physics. </p>

<p>Phillip K Dick the writer in 1977 at a press conference came right out and said it. This is a construct. Bill Burr the comedian on his 2 netflix specials talks about it like we are to stupid to understand it but he, as the voice in the wilderness, (at least at the time) wanted us to know. Bill Burr knew 30 years ago, this was continuation of my recent epiphany, I watched them both last night. </p>

<p>Yeah, somethings telling me to wake up. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not a hive - we&#39;re not insects.  But a &quot;group consciousness.&quot;  We&#39;re individuals, but all part of and descended from some sort of Infinite Intelligence.  If you haven&#39;t, read Napoleon Hill&#39;s &quot;Think and Grow Rich,&quot; or listen to his other book &quot;Outwitting the Devil&quot;: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lcfr6twjk-o">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lcfr6twjk-o</a></p>

<p>Law of attraction - group consciousness - has been utilized for years by the world&#39;s most successful business people.  Jack Canfield of Chicken Soup for the Soul used it, as did MJ DeMarco, Tony Robbins, Oprah Winfrey and hundreds of others.</p>

<p>Some used it consciously, others just fell into it.  Canfield is very telling, as he knows what&#39;s up.  His story is incredible.  Watch his TED Talk like speeches and you&#39;ll see what we mean.  </p>

<p>This phenomenon has been called many things.  But the effect of our influence is not becoming measurable.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Im trying to wake up, believe me! Please try put yourself in the position of someone hearing this type of thing for the first time, its intense. Not that the guy you told to buy a dress was doubting you or anything, he actually expressed a viewpoint that was really quite similar to yours. But instead of agreeing with the bulk of it which was actually common ground, you mocked him. Anyways this is pointless and takes away from the discussion, get back to the good stuff! I was enjoying what you were writing for the most part.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was an atheist at work and I stumbled upon the dr Alexander nde YouTube video by accident. He told a story about dying and seeing the afterlife. I dig into other nde stories and they were shocking but in a good way. That lead me to a book called conversations with God which has wisdom so deep, I had never seen information like it before. I followed the simple instructions inside and my life totally changed. It turns out the mind is like a radio channel. If it is adjusted to the right frequency, miraculous things happen. For example, my life,got 15 times easier. I don&#39;t stress out much. I feel pretty good and life became an adventure. I feel more empowered to help the world. I feel healthier and business even improved. That led me to more digging and now I realize this digging will go on pretty much. Part of life is to unwrap it endlessly like a gift and once you do, you will be pleasantly surprised at what you find. Everything is connected (elite, God, education, economy, the mind, the universe, etc..). </p>

<p>Everyone who reads conversations with God seems to experience this. It&#39;s sold about forty million worldwide. The info inside is just so potent and easy to do that a kid can do it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>would you expand on this, especially to the degree you see the paradigm shift occurring? by &#39;shifting out of religion and dogma&#39; do you mean the divine / mystical authority these connote is fading and will be replaced by nature/ science or do you mean that the ideology of belief/ faith more broadly is headed for a shakeup?
basically, i guess, are you saying that the object of belief is shifting (from religion to science) while remaining structurally the same, or that the structure itself is fundamentally changing? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>What I mean is that we have all these religious constructs. These are beliefs, like authority, our origins, hierarchy, the comparison of good and evil, to name a few of the Components of the belief System of religion. All of these constructs are being looked at intensely. We are going through a process of analyzing these constructs to determine if we would like to continue using them. Ultimately their intensity on our perception will fade. We won&#39;t hold to religion, and their constructs as absolutes. Doing so will open up more choices towards a different paradigm.</p>

<p>So you may sense the power of these religious constructs being lessened and as important as they were before.</p>

<p>Working on proof that our geometric energy grid has intersection points. And at these points energy is pooled and can be transformed. And the south pole is a major portal at an absolute coordinate point intersection. And that the temple there has the ability to transform our collective thought forms into manifestation. This may seem abstract, but I think what they are seeing inside is the result of the south pole, or negatively charged energy portal of the world creating the fear and amplified symbols of evil.</p>

<p>The pyramid is a perfect solid, and has the ability to  amplify and transmute and intensify anything inside. So if the energy flowing inside is corrupted,  the experience manifests as trap doors and poisons and evil. They are not pure of heart those who are entering. Like all of our myths of heaven..even in like India Jones who is pure of heart is given a choice which cup to fill. Or in the phrase, &quot;Only the penitent man can pass&quot; . It&#39;s a trial. A temple of transformation of energy.. I&#39;m thinking out loud, head spinning..</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I would attribute it to NYE, I think it&#39;s pretty common to think back and reflect about your year and what&#39;s to come. Plus, it&#39;s probably reinforced by the media (TV, radio, Internet) blabbering on and on about lists of thing related to the end of the year (stuff like year in review, top songs/movies/books of the year). For example, if X media outlet talks about the book of the year, and it&#39;s a book I read in March, I&#39;ll most likely remember about that time period, what I was doing, how I felt, etc, thus triggering more reflection on my part.</p>

<p>On the other hand, coincidentally today I randomly remembered that one of my professors back in college some years ago talked about collective consciousness and 9/11. This was a totally random memory that popped into my mind and I did a google search and started reading about the GCP. </p>
