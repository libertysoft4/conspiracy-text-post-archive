        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Hello,</p>

<p>I posted recently, and will continue to post until I feel there is a change of &quot;pace,&quot; and everything slows down... but I don&#39;t feel like that&#39;s going to happen anytime soon.</p>

<p>First.. read this - <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2016/10/13/executive-order-coordinating-efforts-prepare-nation-space-weather-events">https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2016/10/13/executive-order-coordinating-efforts-prepare-nation-space-weather-events</a></p>

<p>Regardless what you think, this Order is worded very seriously and encompasses a huge amount of resources in only a short release. It was released rather quickly and;</p>

<p>&quot;But the order bypassed the North American Electric Reliability Corp. (NERC), the interstate grid security monitor, which has been developing solar storm protections for the grid since 2012.</p>

<p>&quot;It was a surprise to us,&quot; said Gerry Cauley, NERC president and CEO.&quot;</p>

<p>Let me pre-face with the reason I think everything is getting &quot;wacky,&quot;</p>

<p><a href="http://www.wizaurad.com/axis-drift.html">http://www.wizaurad.com/axis-drift.html</a></p>

<p>We are wobbling on our axis, which will obviously have consequences on the earth.. if you notice in that plot diagram that the latter half of 2016 looks much more.. extreme. Why is this happening? I don&#39;t know. Climate scientists will tell you that our water levels are causing this to happen.. but this is actually a debated topic and not proven.. essentially a &quot;theory.&quot; This is just a theory of mine, so bash it all you will but take in some of the rest of this information seriously and take note because this isn&#39;t a fucking joke.</p>

<p>For Earth Changes (weather,seismic,volcanic) I am going to do November and December.. because November is when I started to become &quot;awake,&quot; that there is something not quite right with our planet at the moment and it is behaving abnormally.

<p>STILL WITH ME? </p>

<p>That was just November! Apologies for the formatting but this is a pigs ear to write.</p>

<p>Let me just drop in a few scripture statements that are interesting..
“Disasters will soon spread from nation to nation. They will come like a powerful storm to all the faraway places on earth… The DESTROYER will come against every town, not one town will escape… The Lord said this will happen.” Jeremiah 25:32 &amp; 48:8.</p>

<p>Below is from Kolbrin bible;
Manuscripts 3:3 When ages pass, certain laws operate upon the stars in the Heavens. Their ways change; there is movement and restlessness, they are no longer constant and a great light appears redly in the skies.
(I keep pointing how intense and red sunsets are at the moment in places that normally do not experience those types of sunsets)</p>

<p>Manuscripts 3:6 The people will scatter in madness. They will hear the trumpet and battle-cry of the DESTROYER and will seek refuge within dens in the Earth. Terror will eat away their hearts, and their courage will flow from them like water from a broken pitcher. They will be eaten up in the flames of wrath and consumed by the breath of the DESTROYER.</p>

<p>Manuscripts 3:1 Men forget the days of the Destroyer. Only the wise know where it went and that it will return in its appointed hour</p>

<p><a href="http://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/hercolobus/kolbrin_08.htm">http://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/hercolobus/kolbrin_08.htm</a>
Got all that shit from here.</p>

<p>Take all that as you will.. but I do find it interesting nonetheless.. especially the whole blood-red moon end times theory and we&#39;ve had at least 4 this year? More than usual and its been pretty abnormal.</p>

<p>Going to pre-face December with some quick facts about Earthquakes.. because most of you will be saying &quot;volcanoes and earthquakes happen all the time.&quot; and you&#39;d be RIGHT! they do.. but;</p>

<p>There have been 257 earthquakes over magnitude 5 and many more very close to this number. Just to put this into perspective on average there is an estimated 3.6 earthquakes of a magnitude of 5-5.9 a day, in the last 9 days there have been an average of 24.8 nearly 7 times what is usual. It is estimated there is a 6-6.9 magnitude earthquake every 3 days, we have had 2.6 a day for the last 9 days. Lastly for the big earthquakes of magnitude 7-7.9 you usually get 1 every 25 days (estimate) there have been an average of 1 a day for the last 9 days.

<p>This is also referencing a cosmic energy wave, which is also being attributed (mostly on youtube unfortunately.. but nothing [mainstream] is talking about this) a helium gas cloud which we have entered bringing in higher H3,H4 into our atmosphere. does anybody know what a brown dwarf star is made of????? (HELIUM)</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCyLWFZoAlE">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCyLWFZoAlE</a> - WAVES OF ENERGY BEING PICKED UP MIMIC?</p>

<p>as a caveat to the brown dwarf statement.. we are constantly moving through space so its possible we&#39;ve just entered a fuck off massive helium cloud (our entire solar system) through no means of anything nibiru, end times, or whatever related.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Incredible work!</p>

<p>Though you have only reported on the latter months of 2016, have you checked to see if these changes are irregular within our history.. is the scale of natural disasters and incidents like this increasing dramatically in recent times, as I have not checked this myself. Depending on how far back you go there will reach a point in recent history where reportings of such incidents are lower due to the rapid access of information and ways of reading into the specifics of what happens on earth.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>True,</p>

<p>I have run out of 40K characters apparently.. haha!</p>

<p>I have done as much reading into the &quot;trend,&quot; of things as I possibly can. It would be stupid to say that the world has never been in a state like it currently is as we&#39;ve only been recording information for a fraction of the time it has actually been here..</p>

<p>My thoughts are.. the trends are on a rise in relation to the wobble we are experiencing. If you look at the plotgraph, the latter half of 2016 appears to have become more dramatic. Why is the wobble happening exactly? I don&#39;t know.. I am trying my best to find out but there is so much disinformation everywhere it is literally so hard to discern fact from fiction sometimes.</p>

<p>Just to add - &quot;Record-breaking year of earthquakes: 32828 quakes hit New Zealand in 2016.&quot; This was announced today..some food for thought! </p>

<p>There is a lot of absolute shite everywhere on Nibiru that discredits it as a whole, but there a few areas of information that approach it as objectively as possible. There has been a very large increase in &quot;Sun Dogs,&quot; recently worldwide, and unexplainable looking sunsets/weird horizon glows. I suggest you start looking up and looking out for any abnormalities where you are.. but it is much more visible in the Souther Hemisphere. Sun Dog is a term coined by the CIA in the 1960&#39;s..similar to the term &quot;conspiracy theory.&quot;</p>

<p>having things like r/nibiru being banned just adds to my speculation. I want to make it clear though, I am not even a quarter of a century yet and want nothing more than the &quot;end of the world,&quot; to happen. I have a happy life and a beautiful girlfriend.. but something has awoken within me that has me thinking a bit differently at the moment alongside things I am seeing and reading. Read up! Be safe.. make your own decisions but keep an eye on the Earth because it can be very telling if things pick up in intensity and frequency.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thank you for the enlightenment, I will be sure to heed your advice and look into it more, of course disinformation is ever muddying the waters, it is good to build a trust of different sources, but this is hard in the &#39;mainstream&#39;. There is much talk of a collective premonition to &quot;something big is going to happen&quot; with the world, but you could say that sentiment has been with us a while, who knows how long. Destiny may be defined by our actions, but there are certain forces outside of our control, what ever happens, happens, so all we can do is live a life of love, laughter and illuminate the way. That being said, these topics are fascinating. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This won&#39;t be easy to address in its entirety however; I will touch base on it as best I can. (the formatting is harder in a comment reply box then on a MS Word document. <a href="/u/nibiru_chaser">/u/nibiru_chaser</a></p>

<p>A personal Note:
You are an intelligent person, vivisected by media; But your factually correct; Just off; Just the way they intended it to be;</p>

<p>So lets hit the basis of this; Firstly remove the biblical aspects and focus on the stories themselves. Revelations &quot;an endtime&quot; prophecy is likely a story that&#39;s repeated itself in our history; We see things like rising of locusts; Rivers turning to blood, and earthquakes, (trumpets), and mostly flooding; </p>

<p>What most people think however is that some Magical deity was ultimately responsible for this; Which isn&#39;t how modern science dictates these event&#39;s at all; (have we seen similar events on earth lately). Yes, it is confirmed; There have been rivers that have turned red (in recent years), as well as locust, and large amounts of flooding; </p>

<p>Now second fable: In antartica There is a hollow earth! And an ancient society under the ice masses That is why they are there!</p>

<p>Unlikely...</p>

<p>What does that have to do with anything; Well it is important; </p>

<p>Thirdly Chemtrails. They are trying to kill us all! -
(we have virus strands that are so volatile that we could literally cause an extinction in a single years time), (or near extinction), so Factually the silver sparkles in the sky aren&#39;t a secret... Or are they?</p>

<p>Chemtrails have every reason to be secrets, but your operating under the prospective reasoning that everyone on earth is evil (inherently). What if the truth was more frightening; So frightening that you have to lie about it, but not evil at all. Do those that wind up dead getting to the bottom of these incidents fall into a rampant coincidence? Likely not; But that is where my post will take a dark turn all the same...</p>

<p>What if the real truth, is that for years climatologists have been researching factors such as aerial methane depositing; Via oceanic and ground ice patches being thawed and released into the environment; This having caused a vast amount of ozone decay. </p>

<p>What if the ozone decay, leads to more caustic radiation waves via solar depositing; Leading to global warming; Essentially melting more Ice, and in turn more methane. (accelerating the process).  </p>

<p>What if the acceleration of these processes are causing all of the problems mentioned in this post?</p>

<p><strong>Introducing &quot;the holocene extinction&quot;.</strong> </p>

<p><em>Rule out the basic conspiracies when dealing with science, and ask yourself; Why did buzz aldrin, and John Kerry fly to antartica. What do we know about the trip?</em> </p>

<p>Well Buzz is a figure head of the NASA Complex. Likely a genius
John Kerry is a figure head of the Whitehouse. Likely a Gov Reporter. 
(who does John report to?) The president of the united states. </p>

<p>What is the president doing? <strong>Emergency electric grid restructuring;</strong> </p>

<p><em>What does that confirm:</em></p>

<p>Well we know that an ice sheet the size of Deleware is factually melting off the antartic peninsula, and that the mass is enough to likely swamp large cities on coastal plains. Built on sealevel, and sometimes below. (are we seeing that sort of destabilization yet)?</p>

<p>Yes
By example the beaches in both Florida, and California are decaying. Katrina&#39;s had multiple flooding incidents. (so the gulf of new mexico is taking effect. From Thailand, to Japan, and Chile, Brazil. Their coasts are beginning to decay (tsunamis).</p>

<p>Why? It&#39;s likely the original process, and everything to do with the original topic; (Protection from space weather)... </p>

<p>It isn&#39;t that the sun is going supernova early, it is that the magnetosphere, is weakening; Hence the chemtrails as mentioned before, and the US Airforces (obviously secret mission), to combat them. Those grids are likely introduced to the upper atmosphere to fight off highly decayed sections of the ozone layer itself. This is if anything an attempt to cool the planet; Virtually attempting to thwart off the very humanistic abuses that were rampantly destroying our planet for centuries. Everything from oil, to carbon, methane, and radioactivity; Pesticides, poisons, you name it. </p>

<p>Were living in the middle of an extinction, and don&#39;t think that Chinas recent exploration into going green is because the costs are effective. I mean think rationally. On certain days they shut down the entire city so people can simply breath in the vast amount of ppm10 particulate active coating their lungs. It&#39;s more often then not kitty cats fall off skyscrapers from oxygen loss, as their lungs aren&#39;t even equipped as well as a humans...</p>

<p><strong>The grid itself</strong></p>

<p>To protect the grid, is the ultimate duty as humans, because more than any mentionable threat to this planet current date if you take the grid out; Multiple nuclear failures will occur simultaneously. 
Factually 11 power stations taken offline, could lead to complete nuclear failure, and planetary extinction, and this is all well known. Hence the push for Breeder reactors, which are a safer utility for power production... (I won&#39;t say how much safer because they are still on trial, and for all we really know they really still aren&#39;t that safe). (I am a bit of a cunt though, and don&#39;t like actinides)...</p>

<p><em>So Back on track</em></p>

<p><strong>How do we know it is the holocene?</strong>
That is the simplest part. Just look at all the wildlife dieoffs the op has mentioned. These are not coincidences as if millions of species suddenly commit mass suicide; No, these are indications that the geo magnetic mechanisms that control their flight paths, or submarine geolocations are being severely delimited in nature itself. </p>

<p><strong>Now lets take antartica more expressly</strong></p>

<p>Antartica = global heating. 
The global heating leads to self cooling; Stagnant waters lead to invasive species and diseases. Think locust and birdflu by primary examples. Although they also lead to apple maggots, viruses in plant life; Less crops; And we are factually seeing this in real time. Leading to even more mass dieoffs and situations we can&#39;t control. </p>

<p>If the icesheets are destabilizing; Its due to temperatures in the ocean rising; If the ocean is rising in temperature; It means that the magma chambers are responding, and a mass volcanic episode is nearing; Because at a fundamental level; When we gave not one damn about mothernature; She gives not one damn about us, and our considerations to save her now are a laughing stock to her 
having been tested.</p>

<p>So when the iceshelf detatches, she will flood and cool what she can, and if that isn&#39;t enough then fields such as old faithful, and mega volcanoes will act accordingly, erasing the heat from the planet itself, by shielding the earth itself from the sun light; Thus causing an event we will no longer write about in the history books, Because the future won&#39;t exist;</p>

<p>So Is antartica important Yes. But not because we found some ancient species, but because it is our species itself becoming ancient; Do the rivers have blood in them. No, because scientists now know the discoloration is caused by arsenic deposits, from weakening submarine volcanic tubes, that are escalating in self decay. </p>

<p><strong>What does this mean</strong>?
Paging: Globalhell-</p>

<p>This is no coincidence- The truth is lie&#39;s exist so you can&#39;t put the pieces together; So when obama makes additions to the grid; Its not because there isn&#39;t a situation; It is because the situation itself is so un-contained, that they would rather lie to you, then tell you the truth, as it were. Hence the epa being tight lipped about the crop failures, The airforce being tight lipped about the chem-trails, 
Hence every lie and misfactuation of the truth; and every preposterous theory, and media grab pulling you in every direction; 
Accept toward the truth, because no one has the balls to tell you that this is the truth, and the world itself is ending. </p>

<p>Hope that helped. Not sure it does, But at least now you know...</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpHU36uJnMc">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpHU36uJnMc</a></p>

<p>This has been looked into for decades now.. so it&#39;s not a new &quot;conspiracy.&quot; </p>

<p>Thing is..an incoming cosmic SOMETHING doesn&#39;t necessarily have to be &quot;Nibiru,&quot; as was discussed by Zachariah Sitchen.. but just something that is coming our way as proposed by Dr Harrington.. and discussed by many people around the world (Herculobus)</p>

<p>If you look at his &quot;proposed orbit,&quot; that thing is INCOMING there is no denying that..then you notice where it is in our solar system and that ties up with NASA sending probes to that location. Add the Vatican and having an infrared satellite..why? Dr Harrington had a peculiarly quick death maybe two years after this video.. he was in NZ to be at a good viewing location to increase his chances of visibility for his proposed planet.</p>

<p>The sun has been tilted 6 degrees - <a href="http://www.astronomy.com/news/2016/10/planet-nine-tilting-the-sun">http://www.astronomy.com/news/2016/10/planet-nine-tilting-the-sun</a></p>

<p>Planet 9 doesn&#39;t even mean Nibiru, could be two totally different things...it just means there is shit going on in our solar system which we are just &quot;discovering,&quot; so.. i&#39;m keeping my eyes open to literally anything being possible at this point in time.</p>

<p>(harvest / ascension information)</p>

<p>What they call &quot;green&quot; energy is apparently best received at 20 degrees off north - rather than aligning with magnetic north like the pyramids do and so on. This will soon be the paramount energy we will be working with (post-harvest) and so it&#39;s necessary for the planet to align with this new direction to use it. </p>
