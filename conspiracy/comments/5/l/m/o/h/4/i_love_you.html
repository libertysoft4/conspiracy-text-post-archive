<p>We often regard Reddit as wasting and passing time but it&#39;s often disregarded how helpful this platform is.</p>

<p>It allows anyone&#39;s voice to be heard instantly by anyone anywhere on this world.</p>

<p>I am truly thankful to be able to have such a platform, regardless of the negative incidents that have happened with Spez and the like.</p>

<p>We have the ability to spread love, positivity, and upliftment and awareness through this medium.</p>

<p>I have learned, grown, and expanded from the articles, stories, and opinions as well as debates I&#39;ve read while being here.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve learned more about myself. About other people. About how we work together and can come together and change things even anonymously though the Internet.</p>

<p>We have the power to independently investigate and question narratives that are normally controlled (PizzaGate) </p>

<p>We have the ability to connect, uplift, and help each other with the very phone we hold in our hands.</p>

<p>Thank you for what you do. And I mean you, the you that is reading what I am typing right now.</p>

<p>Thank you and I love YOU!</p>

<p>Here is a very good recent lecture: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-w0Odg3k7xM">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-w0Odg3k7xM</a></p>

<p>Here is a good documentary by James Allen on Zero Point Energy and Mark McCandlish: <a href="https://vimeo.com/133170463">https://vimeo.com/133170463</a></p>

<p>This, IMO, is the most important stuff everyone should know about. It&#39;s not discussed much, but I think Zero Point Energy explains many of the anomalies we see in the world today, especially regarding UFOs, and in history.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, there are a lot of things that try to discredit Greer. All I can ask is that anyone looks into this themselves and decides his validity. It is certainly worth researching. I looked into stuff discrediting Greer and haven&#39;t found much more than seemingly false allegations that further gave me confidence in the disclosure project. It&#39;s certainly not perfect, I even contacted them asking why the fuck their website is so shitty and why they don&#39;t make a larger effort to make this hard evidence public. But I certainly recommend researching the topic, and if anyone has time, come back to me with what you find.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Great now is your chance to change. Everyday you wake up you must make this new life happen. Be nice to people and be nice to yourself.
Forgive yourself for your past mistakes and choose to fix them by being a good person from this moment forward.
There are people out there who love you even if you dont love yourself. People who just want to send you love even if you feel you are undeserving. 
You deserve love. 
The universe forgives you.
Now be responsible for your thoughts - create the environment that will help you get and stay positive and do it now.
Not tomorrow - This very moment.</p>

<p>You have the strength and we believe in you. 
You must be the change you want to see in the world.
Be it. Do it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think of light as information. It is also a symbol for awareness. Without awareness of information, the information has no value.</p>

<p>The dark or evil is just pure self-serving behavior at the expense of others. Dark/evil is machine like in that it is very predictable based on the understanding of the perceived prospects for gain and loss and the perceived risks involved of a group or individual.</p>

<p>If we focus our awareness on the darkness we cause it to flee, because we no longer support it systemically, because we have become aware of how it operates. So, yes love is necessary and important, but don&#39;t let rhetoric for love turn us away from looking at the darkness. We will continue to suffer the darkness as long as we refuse to look at it. The examples of this principle are endless and there are many personal individual examples too. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>A loving perspective is an honest perspective. Unconditional love holds no bias or opinion. And what we&#39;re dealing with goes so far against anything we&#39;ve ever known, I theorize that our minds have opened and forcefully awakened themselves to new ways to perceive: more openly. Why? Because, at least personally, the old &#39;me&#39; wouldn&#39;t have been able to believe any of this leaked information unless I went through a change in consciousness and an opening of heart. It&#39;s reminded me what I am -- life itself -- and I no longer see or feel separation. </p>

<p>You can&#39;t teach love, you experience it. With time even a tiny drop of love can change a person... but the true &quot;change&quot; will come from within no matter of external influences.</p>

Also, reading other peoples views has helped me see the world from a different perspective and I&#39;ve actually changed my outlook on alot of issues. Reddit is great....sometimes.</p>
