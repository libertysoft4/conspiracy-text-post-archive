<p>So I&#39;ve been struggling with my belief in the moon, as we&#39;re told it is, for some time now. Here&#39;s where it all began.... feel free to ask questions or better yet, film it yourself some night. It is actually  quite amazing what you see with a little critical thinking. The original video is above and this is my explanation:</p>

<p><a href="https://youtu.be/UVybLNhotD4">https://youtu.be/UVybLNhotD4</a></p>

<p>No need to be harsh as I&#39;ve already received death threats due to my so-called stupidity. I am, on the other hand, very open to criticism. An open mind is one of the most important attributes to me, so I&#39;d love to gather some other thoughts that I might remain open.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>well what else out there is it hitting? You can measure the distance of the object by the time needed for the laser to come back, so there would have to be something at the same distance from the earth that has a mirror on it to aim the laser back</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m afraid I don&#39;t know enough on that subject to answer, but to me it veers off from the original point about us not necessarily knowing the true nature of the moon. Perhaps it&#39;s nature includes its capability to bounce a laser back while still failing to be what textbooks have taught us?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No the uneven surface of the moon would simply fracture the laser and scatter it too much to be registered, this is why the reflectors left on the moon are so necessary for the project. You need a proper reflector to have any hope </p>

<p>This is another sort of reason why a few conspiracies concerning the moon fall down. </p>

<p>Now you could make the argument if you want to stick to the hologram theory that the moon reflectors are simply a satellite with a reflector placed in an orbit to mimic the moon and place the hologram over it. Only problem with that is weve had photography longer than satellites and the moon was in those shots  </p>

<p>I say this as these were times when the great super powers raged wars that led to countries failing and last ditch attempts at survival, that i would argue proves there was no advanced roacketry at that stage as if there was it would have been used in the wars. </p>

<p>A good way i always found to move on with conspiracies if i got stuck was to go the other way and i tried to disprove the conspiracy i was interested in. </p>

<p>As in be your own devils advocate and try tear your theory apart or find holes in it, if you find more holes in it that the &quot;official story&quot; your know to move on if not you know to keep diggin</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ah the lunar wave, tbh thats simply people with their personal telescopes not quite understanding some of the wave affects day to day things can cause and how that can distort ones lens and therefore view of the moon</p>

<p>So for example, ever drive down the road and its really hot and the end of the road seems to be shimmering or like wavey, this is heat waves rising and distorting the light coming through it, therefore your perception of the image on the other side.</p>

<p>Best example i can think of is <a href="http://www.shutterstock.com/video/clip-8345812-stock-footage-very-long-telephoto-shot-of-shipping-coaster-sailing-over-a-a-heat-shimmering-arctic-sea-on-a.html?src=search/HjhZdseTqgmj6OsO6MSlYQ:1:10/gg">this</a> now you and i know the ship isnt some ripley wavey mess its simply the distortion affect of looking at it through the heat waves </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have experienced seeing a heatwave but I was under the impression that the lunar wave was different. This is all a lot to take in though I&#39;ve been researching for years. I&#39;m going to look into your link now. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve watched his videos a few times all the live waves you can see the whole moon is shimmering given the distortion which clearly shows he is looking at it through distortion or pollution if he&#39;s near a big city, co2 emissions could do the same affect </p>

<p>The only clip he showed that was questionable is the final one which is the only on that shows a full unbroken wave from top to bottom with no distortion of the rest of the moon </p>

<p>However if you look this is not a wave. Look at the edges it looks more like a movie wipe. It looks like he doctored it and simply wiped up with a slightly larger image of the moon. Explains why you don&#39;t see that bottom of the screen it would show it to obviously </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The technical details go over my head, I&#39;m afraid. I do have a question for you, though. What would you think if you did believe, without a doubt, that the &quot;lunar wave&quot; captured was genuine and not a camera artifact or other defect/glitch?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If it was genuine and not a distortion affect well tbh the only reason a planet like object would do that is if it was some projection or glitch. Massive earthquakes which MAY be able to do something like this don&#39;t explain it as there is no tectonic plates activity on the moon the other option meteor impacts on the moon causing this again just wouldn&#39;t stack up given the frequency and lack of shoot off debris</p>

<p>So yes if someone witnessed this affect via a satellite or an orbiter or just with a special lens and 100 percent no distortion I would go hologram. However I haven&#39;t seen anything from the lunar wave ATM that makes me think it&#39;s not distortion affects </p>

    <div class="md"><p>because the laser would not come back if there is no surface to reflect left at precise co ordinates </p>

<p>the fact the laser comes back is proof if it didnt come back you know the moon was fake</p>

<p>The speed of a laser is a scientific constant as its the speed of light, you cant fake it the measurement of distance comes from the time it takes to come back, if its closer the laser will come back quicker and youll know its closer</p>

<p>for example if you bounce it off a shiny satellite just right itll come back quicker than from the moon mirror </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Eh do you have like 30k to spend? You need a powerfull laser so you can actually measure it when it comes back and like a a pretty decent telescope to spot it</p>

<p>Most are done in universites by students studying it given how much tech you need. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Satelites are in much closer orbit to than the moon and as such are moving in orbit much faster than the moon, it takes the moon about 27 days to do an orbit where satelites do that in hours. </p>

<p>So to try and work out a system that means there is always enough satelites so that if someone lasers the moon target this bouncing can begin but then make sure that the laser beam comes back exactly at the same angle its sent, as otherwise it couldnt be picked up would be imo pretty impossible </p>

<p>Not going to say unlikely but you are talking 100 hundreds of dedicated satellites with precise guidance thrusters and some serious on the fly math </p>

<p>Secondly the ocean tides are another thing that shows us that the moon exists, you need a large mass to create that gravitational pull on the oceans so there has to be something the same size and mass and distance from the earth as the moon to have that affect </p>

<p>A you can see the laser I put a photo up of a place doing the lasering </p>

<p>B you can&#39;t see the laser hit the moon so if your litmus test for proof is being able to see not just the measured data but the actual thing before you&#39;ll believe it exists then I fear you won&#39;t believe much science to come as it&#39;s done on a nano scale </p>

<p>You can&#39;t see an atom, you can&#39;t see gravity, you can&#39;t see alot of things that&#39;s why we have measurement equipment. I don&#39;t think it&#39;s the best starting point to go from if I&#39;m honest </p>

<p>There is a reason you have equipment. If you want to start a discussion that the equipment is made up or just automated to give a certain response I feel that&#39;s something way too out their to be credible there is just too much info and science behind it </p>

<p>I&#39;ve taken literally thousands of photographs of the moon.  There is nothing strange about it, this is simply an overexposed video creating an illusion due to the limited dynamic range of cameras.</p>

<p>Finally went through some of my photos and found a decent example.  Clearly demonstrates the effect shown in the video, you&#39;d never think that the moon is in front of the tree, it&#39;s merely an illusion created by overexposure:</p>

<p>What about the above link? Do you think this is actually some continuous international effort to deceive the public? That feels less likely than the Moon is real.</p>
