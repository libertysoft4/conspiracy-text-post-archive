        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>As a teacher, I spend a lot of time around children (6th to 8th grade), which means a lot of my time is spent reflecting on their views, actions, etc. I want to note that I understand that every generation thinks the upcoming/younger generations are worse off. However, I am still relatively young (in my 20s), and this goes beyond that. There are some really strange things happening, and the joking title of this post aside, I am actually saddened by what is happening. I love my students, but I am truly concerned for them. </p>

<p><strong>Gender/Sexual Identity</strong></p>

<p>A lot of people seem to be waking up to the fact that it is probably not the best thing for young children to make sweeping identity decisions. Most of us know that it takes a lot of time to figure out who we are, and I believe gender and sexuality are no exceptions. We have gotten to a point where a person&#39;s identity is based solely on their sexuality. On top of that, we are telling our youth that they must figure out exactly who they are through endless labels. We are not allowing them to see that their identity will transform constantly. This is dangerous.</p>

<p>In my youth, I had sexually experimented with girls my age. I questioned whether I was a lesbian or not because, well, I enjoyed it. I am extremely thankful that I waited to identify myself because it turns out I was not a lesbian, just an experimental teenager. What if I had came out with a lesbian? I would be completely tied to that identity, and that would be difficult to question later.</p>

<p>I now have many students (middle-schoolers) who are so proud of being lesbians (or whatever gender label they choose). Of course, I would never bring them down, but I wish I could tell them just to wait and enjoy being a kid. It will all come together eventually. Of course middle schoolers, especially those that struggle with self-esteem, find great belonging in these lgbt groups, and while there is probably some good to that, I think ultimately it will impact them as adults. They are too young to decide who they are going to be forever.</p>

<p>Of course, transgenderism is becoming more common as well. When did it really become &quot;okay&quot; to let children make decisions before puberty, that could ultimately change the course of their lives forever? We would not let a 5 year old get a tattoo, but we are allowing them to make an extremely adult decision in regards to their identity. We have seemed to completely ignore any findings and research on gender dysphoria in the name of tolerance and acceptance. I am NOT saying that gender dysphoria is not real, but I definitely believe that mainstream news paints the issue in a completely bizarre way. </p>

<p>This study (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18981931">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18981931</a>) states,</p>

<p>&quot;Most children with gender dysphoria will not remain gender dysphoric after puberty. Children with persistent GID are characterized by more extreme gender dysphoria in childhood than children with desisting gender dysphoria. With regard to sexual orientation, the most likely outcome of childhood GID is homosexuality or bisexuality.&quot;</p>

<p>I could go on and on with this topic because it gets much deeper. I actually wrote a post about it here if you are interested:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/4lqogy/gender_identity_feminism_and_society_is_there_a/">https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/4lqogy/gender_identity_feminism_and_society_is_there_a/</a></p>

<p>And before you give me the tired argument of &quot;as long as it makes them happy&quot; or &quot;it&#39;s not hurting anyone&quot;, ask yourselves, are we allowing these individuals to hurt themselves as we turn a blind eye?</p>

<p><strong>Technology for the Sake of Technology</strong></p>

<p>It is ingrained in our minds that technology is inherently good. I am here to argue that technology is not inherently good or bad, but that we must be aware that technology is moving much faster than our ability to think about the consequences. </p>

<p>My co-worker and I were arguing about automation. He said he would rather have a robot serve him food than an actual human. I asked him what would happen to the people who needed jobs. He still insisted it was a good thing. I finally said, &quot;Did you ever consider that maybe we should wait on robots until we have actual jobs for all people and a stronger economy?&quot; He looked at me blankly.</p>

<p>I am surprised that I do not see more about this on <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>!</p>

<p>This article (<a href="https://www.wired.com/brandlab/2015/04/rise-machines-future-lots-robots-jobs-humans/">https://www.wired.com/brandlab/2015/04/rise-machines-future-lots-robots-jobs-humans/</a>) assures us that we will find a way to adapt to the future of robots...I am not so sure.</p>

<p>Also, this directly ties into the transhumanism conspiracy. Not only do &#39;they&#39; want people to get comfortable with robots, but I do not think cyborgs (and God knows what else) are going to be a thing of science fiction. This may also involve the promotion of genderlessness in our society, to get people more comfortable with the idea. In a pursuit of ever-lasting life, I honestly feel some would lose their souls (if you believe in that sort of thing). This conspiracy can go deeper, and I would love to hear your thoughts. I am jumping around a little here, but we are not even letting our students evaluate modern technology. We are giving them no choice and telling them all technology is good because it means advancement. Yet, our students will have 2 degrees and not even be able to get a job in the future because a robot can do a cheaper and better job.</p>

<p>What about virtual reality? </p>

<p>Students really are not going outside anymore. I know there are kids who do, but let&#39;s face it, most would rather be on their phones. One of the consequences of this is the health of our students. I feel many of our students are being cheated out of their youth due to obesity. Of course, this goes into our terrible, processed food, but it is not helping that our students are losing natural motivation to just run around. Instead, they need to take sexually provactive pictures and get a million likes so that they feel good about themselves.</p>

<p>One student told me she had literal withdrawals when she could not check her phone. I have much anecdotal evidence, but I am sure you are getting the idea.</p>

<p>On top of that, all this social media is just a way for us (especially our youth) to constantly compare themselves to others. This is really difficult for my students and their self-esteem - as if middle school was not shitty enough for most of them.</p>

<p>Half of teenagers (probably more) feel addicted to their phones:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.cnn.com/2016/05/03/health/teens-cell-phone-addiction-parents/">http://www.cnn.com/2016/05/03/health/teens-cell-phone-addiction-parents/</a></p>

<p>That is not even the scariest study I found.</p>

<p>What we are telling students is that technology for the sake of technology is good. I disagree. Before you criticize me for being a luddite, here is an article about what they really fought against:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/what-the-luddites-really-fought-against-264412/">http://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/what-the-luddites-really-fought-against-264412/</a></p>

<p>It was really more about jobs - not the technology itself.</p>

<p><strong>Narcissism, Lack of Empathy, and Desensitization</strong></p>

<p>This one is probably more obvious, but it is scary.</p>

<p>There are thousands of articles about social media and narcissim:</p>

<p><a href="https://psychcentral.com/news/2016/12/05/social-media-provides-forum-for-narcissistic-individuals-to-self-promote/113460.html">https://psychcentral.com/news/2016/12/05/social-media-provides-forum-for-narcissistic-individuals-to-self-promote/113460.html</a></p>

<p>We now live in a world where, quite frankly, people worship themselves.</p>

<p>On top of that, empathy (emotional intelligence in general) is steadily declining.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/artificial-maturity/201403/why-empathy-is-declining-among-students-and-what-we-can-do">https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/artificial-maturity/201403/why-empathy-is-declining-among-students-and-what-we-can-do</a></p>

<p>Screen time, information overload, and virtual reality are just some of the causes cited in the article.</p>

<p>We hear more about tolerance and love more than ever before, but I do not feel anybody is really practicing it. I have to give actual lessons on empathy in my classes, and by the time students reach 8th grade, it is just really difficult. </p>

<p>In a way, I do not blame our students. There is so much information to digest that it probably makes it difficult to decide what to care about. But let&#39;s be real here. Our students are being taught that something is only worth caring about if it gets a lot of likes or social media exposure.</p>

<p>Then we have desenstization. Growing up, I thought all those warnings about bad music and movies were just coming from uptight, old people. Now I think I understand where they were coming from.</p>

<p>There are countless studies on this, but here is just one example:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2006/07/060727162108.htm">https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2006/07/060727162108.htm</a></p>

<p>Now let me be careful with my wording here. The problem is not necessarily video games themselves (or whatever media you want to discsss). It is more about brain development.  </p>

<p>This article (<a href="http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/752088">http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/752088</a>) states, &quot;We conclude that aggressive media activates an emotion–attention network that has the capability to blunt emotional responses through reduced attention with repeated viewing of aggressive media contents, which may restrict the linking of the consequences of aggression with an emotional response, and therefore potentially promotes aggressive attitudes and behavior.&quot;</p>

<p>We have removed all limitations from our society. Our children and teens are treated like adults, and they are far from it. I challenge anybody in here to stop watching tv or movies for a few week and see if their empathy and awareness increases.</p>

<p><strong>Being Entertained to Death</strong></p>

<p>I post about this one a lot, but it overwhelms me. Students struggle with boredom and this new, instant gratification culture is ridding them of creativity and critical thinking. Being bored is good for you (at least sometimes!):</p>

<p><a href="http://greatist.com/happiness/benefits-of-boredom/amp">http://greatist.com/happiness/benefits-of-boredom/amp</a></p>

<p>Now I do everything in my power to engage my students, but I really feel students today lack discipline in key areas. It is extremely difficult for them to sit and read a book. I honestly believe reading is an art form that takes time to master. I also believe a lot of behavior issues are linked to overstimulation. Students do not get a second to reflect and relax during the day. </p>

<p>I have the highest test scores in my district and I work with some rough students. I actually explain to teachers that I give breaks and we practice being bored. The teachers all probably think I am crazy, but there are real studies to back this up. I actually did a whole presentation on this if anybody is truly interested.</p>

<p>Plus, when students have no time alone with their thoughts, they have no time for critical thinking. They are constantly distracted and have lost a lot of their curiosity. They have the world at their fingertips, but that is not enough anymore.</p>

<p>Our society does not value intelligence. Students who are hard-workers and truly intellectually curious are often bullied. We wonder why our education system is so terrible, but what or who are our societal role models? Adults do not spend time reading literature or having philosophical debates. They either do not have time to or do not care. And you can be smart, but not too smart, right? When is the last time you had a real intellectual conversation with somebody in real life?</p>

<p>Of course I am generalizing, and I have written on this topic as well. Modern education is a complete joke. I wrote more here if you are interested:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/4c7qkz/what_is_wrong_with_modern_education_a_teachers/">https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/4c7qkz/what_is_wrong_with_modern_education_a_teachers/</a></p>

<p>I really like this quote and explanation from Brave New World:</p>

<p>&quot;Just to give you a general idea,&quot; he would explain to them. For of course some sort of general idea they must have, if they were to do their work intelligently—though as little of one, if they were to be good and happy members of society, as possible. For particulars, as every one knows, make for virtue and happiness; generalities are intellectually necessary evils. Not philosophers but fret-sawyers and stamp collectors compose the backbone of society. (1.5)&quot;</p>

<p>Much of the power the World State has over its citizens has to do with intellectual control. The Director&#39;s inclination that people should know only a little about the &quot;general idea&quot; is similar to Mustapha&#39;s later claim that thinking about purpose is a danger to society. Big thoughts lead to ideas of God, to philosophy, to questioning, to curiosity—all incompatible with blissful ignorance.</p>

<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>

<p>I am not here to criticize my students. I love them, and most of this is beyond our control. As always, I do not know what can be done, but we must always be willing to protect our freedom of speech and these discussions. Maybe we can slowly help wake our youth up, unless they are just too heavily programmed.</p>

<p>This is all about control - control of intelligence, fertility, identity, thought, etc. </p>

<p>The scariest part of this all is that we teach our youth that they have complete freedom. The thing is, even if they still technically have some freedom (most here would argue they do not), the prison is in their own minds. They literally have to somehow break through this mental prison without even knowing they are in it.</p>

<p>As always, I am here for discussion and would love to hear your thoughts.</p>

<p>The only way we can make a difference is through teaching, properly educating those we can reach. Not an easy job within the type  of &quot;school&quot; system we currently have, but even teaching kids to be bored?! You are certainly on the right track, and amazingly so! xD</p>

<p>The hard part is making others WANT to listen; to WANT to understand their own peronal lives, places, freedoms, and responsibilities on this planet. Not an easy job to say the least, but you clearly know what you&#39;re doing. I&#39;m impressed and very thankful that you exist.</p>

<p>Keep on keepin&#39; on. You can find a way.</p>

<p>Believe it!!!! ;p</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hey it&#39;s me.  :)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I want to note that I understand that every generation thinks the upcoming/younger generations are worse off.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This could be another post in and of itself.  Just to throw out a couple of thoughts, I think technology enhances life in some ways such as access to information and communication and diminishes life in other ways like putting you into a loop of stagnation such as with video games, porn, watching TV, etc.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>However, I am still relatively young (in my 20s)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Don&#39;t tell me you feel like you are getting old.  :P  You are a beautiful young woman.  :)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I am actually saddened by what is happening. I love my students, but I am truly concerned for them.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I am sad too about what is happening.  I remind myself that a lot of it isn&#39;t their fault but rather the fault of manipulative influences and lack of positive influences.  I want to do the best I can over the course of a lifetime to help others.  Beyond that, I really do believe that there is more to life than just this life and the material world.  That helps me cope with how things are immensely.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>We have gotten to a point where a person&#39;s identity is based solely on their sexuality.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Speaking as a guy and reflecting on when I was their age, my identity was on two fronts.  One being how males saw me and how females saw me.  What I cared about in terms of how females saw me was all about what you said: my sexuality.  With males, you want to be seen as cool in a way that is not at all sexual I feel.</p>

<p>I think your bisexuality and being a female gives you a much different perspective than mine.  Plus I don&#39;t know how kids are these days anywhere remotely near to how well you do.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>On top of that, we are telling our youth that they must figure out exactly who they are through endless labels. We are not allowing them to see that their identity will transform constantly. This is dangerous.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I think especially in your grade range, the kids get into small cliques, which also have their own identity.  I am not sure if it is the case for your students but for me 7th grade was the grade level that I started having a locker and went to classes on my own.  At first, most students feel lonely since they don&#39;t know the people by their locker or they have a crush on someone by their locker.  This makes them want to fit in and impress the person they have a crush on.  After that, they feel like they have an identity and are afraid to detach themselves from that identity in fear of the loneliness they felt before they had their identity.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Of course, I would never bring them down, but I wish I could tell them just to wait and enjoy being a kid.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is an example of you suppressing yourself.  I would try to do the same as you in this case.  :)  You are being very professional by doing this especially given your passion about the subject.  I just worry about you bottling things up inside too much!  :)  You can always talk to me if you just need to let things out.  I know first hand it makes me feel free and that I am really being myself.  :)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>We have seemed to completely ignore any findings and research on gender dysphoria in the name of tolerance and acceptance.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Since we are on r/conspiracy, I will add that companies make a whole lot more money off of &quot;treating&quot; gender dysphoria than taking the wait and see approach.  Also, to synthesize your thoughts, it very well may be more harmful to the child to go along with their early tendency than it is to &quot;restrain&quot; them with the likelihood of the tendency to change as time passes.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>are we allowing these individuals to hurt themselves as we turn a blind eye?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I think you hit on a key problem with society.  Many of the good people in society turn a blind eye to things.  In this particular case, I think the families dealing with this being informed of the kind of information you presented is important.  It allows the family to make a better decision.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It is ingrained in our minds that technology is inherently good.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I thought this until I was awakened for the most part.  I did acknowledge that technology&#39;s addictiveness did have drawbacks to your mental health such as feelings of withdrawal as you bring up later.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Technology is moving much faster than our ability to think about the consequences.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I think that just about everyone doesn&#39;t even consider the consequences unless the risks are blatant.  Even if there are consequences, a high percentage of people wouldn&#39;t care unless it impacted themselves.</p>

<p>I like how you brought up your conversation with your co-worker about automation.  It seems he may have only been thinking about how it would impact him and not the rest of society.  Probably due to it being engrained in his mind that technology is always an improvement.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Also, this directly ties into the transhumanism conspiracy. Not only do &#39;they&#39; want people to get comfortable with robots, but I do not think cyborgs (and God knows what else) are going to be a thing of science fiction.</p>

<p>Look no further than r/all and mainstream media to see what kind of things &quot;they&quot; want people to get comfortable with.  :P  I agree with you that robots, androids, and cyborgs will not just be science fiction; if we don&#39;t do ourselves in by that time.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This may also involve the promotion of genderlessness in our society, to get people more comfortable with the idea.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I didn&#39;t even consider this.  Nice connecting the dots to come up with a new hypothesis.  :)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In a pursuit of ever-lasting life, I honestly feel some would lose their souls (if you believe in that sort of thing).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I had not given this thought either.  Though if you believe in hell or punishment for evil deeds in the afterlife, this could be a means of avoiding it.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>We are giving them no choice and telling them all technology is good because it means advancement.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If only they knew it means the advancement towards the New World Order agenda in certain cases.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Students really are not going outside anymore.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is a problem for adults too who work indoor jobs and have busy lives.  The best I can manage during the work week is to eat lunch outside when the weather is nice enough.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Of course, this goes into our terrible, processed food, but it is not helping that our students are losing natural motivation to just run around.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The school lunches are usually quite unhealthy, at least back in my day, not to mention the fact that many people are not aware of what is unhealthy to eat.  Many people I know just trust that the food they eat is fine beyond the occasional article they read that is often influenced by some sort of special interest.  Non-GMO and organic food is too expensive for many Americans to afford.</p>

<p>As far as their lack of motivation to do physical activity, I think their diet and physical strength have a lot to do with it.  I suspect other things conspiracy related impact this as well.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>On top of that, all this social media is just a way for us (especially our youth) to constantly compare themselves to others. This is really difficult for my students and their self-esteem - as if middle school was not shitty enough for most of them.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I think this stems from some people needing attention more than others.  It might be a personality trait or lack of attention when the student was younger.  They are trying to fill a void using what other people think about them to fill it.  This is quite dangerous to their mental health in the event there is a negative response from others.</p>

<p>I just wish it was more clear to people that things will come to you if you are friendly to others.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>On top of that, empathy (emotional intelligence in general) is steadily declining.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I didn&#39;t know that but it does not surprise me.  People live very repetitive almost robotic lifestyles such that when something out of the norm happens, people don&#39;t know how to react.  More importantly, as you were getting at, many people are so self centered  that they really don&#39;t care about how the other person feels.  I see this when just walking around in public.  People are off in their own world; disconnected from others.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>We hear more about tolerance and love more than ever before, but I do not feel anybody is really practicing it. I have to give actual lessons on empathy in my classes, and by the time students reach 8th grade, it is just really difficult.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I agree.  For many people of our generation and younger, relationships are disposable transactions.  It is basically just another high like drugs, alcohol, video games, etc.  That is not real love.</p>

<p>You teaching your students empathy is another example of how great of a teacher you are in my eyes.  :)</p>

<p>I think if the education system wasn&#39;t manipulated, it would be a consideration to have an ethics class to at least get students thinking about doing things for the greater good of society.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Our students are being taught that something is only worth caring about if it gets a lot of likes or social media exposure.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I think this comes from people not wanting to feel like they don&#39;t fit in.  If their friends ask them, &quot;Did you hear about [fill in the blank]?&quot; and they say no, they feel like they don&#39;t fit in or they aren&#39;t as good as the other person.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I challenge anybody in here to stop watching tv or movies for a few week and see if their empathy and awareness increases.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I pretty much only watch TV or movies when I am peer pressured into it.  :P  Since I stopped watching TV and playing video games, my empathy and awareness has definitely increased.</p>

<p>Regarding boredom, I think something that has really helped me is to live a balanced life.  The higher the highs are the lower the lows are.  I think it is possible to live steadily towards the middle in the positive half.</p>

<p>My comment got so long I had to break it off into two parts.  :P</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hey it&#39;s me.  (Again :P). Here is the rest of my comment.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I also believe a lot of behavior issues are linked to overstimulation. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>I think so too.  The problem is getting them out of the stimulation loop.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Students do not get a second to reflect and relax during the day.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I didn&#39;t think about this since I have had plenty of time for self reflection in my life.  Even back in high school, I would smoke with my friends and reflect on things.  Self reflection is very important but can sometimes be taken too far to the point it lowers self esteem.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I actually explain to teachers that I give breaks and we practice being bored. The teachers all probably think I am crazy, but there are real studies to back this up. I actually did a whole presentation on this if anybody is truly interested.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Haha, that&#39;s hilarious.  :)  These type of things you do as a teacher are things I could imagine myself doing if I was a teacher.  I hate to break it to the other teachers but everyone is crazy.  :P  You probably already I guessed that I would like to see your presentation.  :)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Students who are hard-workers and truly intellectually curious are often bullied. We wonder why our education system is so terrible, but what or who are our societal role models?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I can totally identify with this when I was a kid.  I was hard working and intellectually curious but sort of kept it a secret because I was also rebellious and wanted to show that off to be cool and sexually appealing.  What I eventually learned is that you should just be yourself and your friends will end up being the people who are on the same wavelength as your true self.</p>

<p>Also, great point about role models.  Gangster rappers and certain female pop artists are not good role models but those are the kinds of people those around that age look up to the most.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>most of this is beyond our control</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I like to think there are ways to make a major difference.  Take a look at WikiLeaks for example.  I think through the internet is the way the biggest difference can be made.  The internet connects much of the world together.  We have the light of truth and the power of unity on our side.  :)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This is all about control - control of intelligence, fertility, identity, thought, etc.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Agreed.  They want more control so that they can better steer us into the direction they want to go.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>the prison is in their own minds. They literally have to somehow break through this mental prison without even knowing they are in it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A very profound way to conclude your message.  :)  I have given you advice personally on how to break free of the chains of your mind.  My username itself is a means of accomplishing this.  I still have a long way to go myself but I think many people live their whole lives imprisoned within their own mind.</p>

<p>Thanks for taking the time to share your thoughts with everyone.  You really do bring a perspective on things that I hadn&#39;t considered that I tend to agree with.  :)  Thanks as always for the hard work you do for the students.  It is not by mistake that you have the highest test scores in your district.  :)  Talk to you soon!  :)</p>

<p>Don&#39;t let it get to you too much.</p>

<p>We&#39;ve all kinda just been dropped into this mess. Obviously you are doing what you can to sort it out.</p>

<p>Sometimes, you still need to let go and live for yourself a little. That way, when Life demands it, you can help again when you are needed.</p>

<p>I know it&#39;s hard when we see this all around us every day, especially you as a teacher!! But...</p>

<p>Not too much obsessing please :)</p>

<p>Only what we need to survive!!!</p>
