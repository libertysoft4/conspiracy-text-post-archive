    <div class="md"><p>My theory is that at least every religion since 100 BC has been created by the elites to hide the truth of our ancient astronaut/alien history. </p>

<p>Observe the Mormon ties to Freemasonry and the number of Washington bigwigs with early Mormon ties. Also, FLDS ties to child trafficking and organized crime.</p>

<p>Constantine didn&#39;t convert to Christianity. He merely adapted it to serve the state, attached his own preferred format of paganism to it, and stripped it of its revolutionary aspects, replacing them with state-worship. </p>

<p>Islam 
The Empire-building religion. Judaism rebranded. Christian was created to promote orthodoxy and social order, Islam on the otherhand was an improved form of social control in that it literally teaches submission to authority, as well as zealous nationalism, black and white legalistic morality, and instills the belief of supernatural and hypersexual rewards for those who give their lives in service to the kaliphate. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I would say it can be obvious in the presence of Organized religion, so long as one is able to step outside of their own cultural biases and beliefs, and examines the ancient myths and recent discovers of science and archaeology. Language is the real barrier to this realization. The ancient gods of Japan, Tibet, India, Greece, Canaan, Egypt, and the tribes of the Americas are one in the same. Through time, the different dialects of Earth diverged and thus the names of the &quot;gods&quot; did as well. The titans/nephilim/Si-te-cah were giants created by aliens to labor and serve their needs. They built the monoliths and ruled over ancient cultures like the Sumerians. Genesis is their origin story, not ours, as is the Egyptian creation myth. They were a flawed creation, not because they sinned, but because they had mistakenly been created with the ability to make choices. They were wiped out by mankind and other alien races, such as the Dogon/Dagin/Djinn/Dragons and the grays/Olympians/Eloid (who would later take their place as the rulers of Egypt, Greece, Ecuador, and China for a time). </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Who also was involved (essentially through Hubbard and slightly with Parsons)  in instructing the CIA with mind control techniques which ultimately led to MK-Ultra and that continued fuckery. I&#39;m not even going to get into the Roswell aspect and LRH being a SciFi author... The KGB also learned these techniques but that&#39;s why it&#39;s interesting from the &quot;controlled army&quot; aspect. I mean it&#39;s been &quot;working&quot; from what I can tell which is sad but from a general perspective, it&#39;s fucked that people are paying thousands of dollars to learn techniques I can look up online. I don&#39;t prescribe to those but I think I&#39;m pretty &quot;clear&quot; and I&#39;ve gotten there all on my own, everyone can.</p>
