<p>And then the OBVIOUS smear campaign on russia. With russia rigging US elections, and Russia hacking. Which neither is true. It turns out it was the CIA. Shocking.</p>

<p>And then Clintons escalation in talk about Russia. Saying that she would take CYBER ATTACKS as DECLARATIONS OF WAR.</p>

<p>Unless you a fucking stupid cunt or a paid shill, you&#39;d see she has malicious intent in regards to Russia.</p>

<p>With this Syria shit, it still looks like the MIC may still get a war with Russia after all.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Why are you so deadset on defending Russia? Their global interests directly go against American interest.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>With russia rigging US elections, and Russia hacking</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No one has claimed they rigged the elections. People are saying that they hacked the DNC and RNC, and selectively chose to decide what to leak and how they framed. In addition, they led a massive propaganda campaign online in social media, in order to make sure there was as much chaos as possibe, and with the ultimate hopes of making sure Clinton didn&#39;t win.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Saying that she would take CYBER ATTACKS as DECLARATIONS OF WAR.</p>

<p>Source? Evidence?</p>

<blockquote>

<p>So what. Fuck Russia. They aren&#39;t our friends.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Trump has also been pushing war with Iran, and possibly North Korea. But you don&#39;t say shit about that.</p>

<p>War is bad. It&#39;s a very easy concept to understand. Do you get it? Do I need to repeat my self? War is bad.</p>

<p>Killing our brothers, fathers, and sons so that the banking industry can install a bank, so qudaffi can&#39;t have a gold standard, so that oil can rape the lands of other countries. THAT IS BAD. </p>

<p>I will never ever vote for someone who promises war. </p>

<hr/>

<p>Donald trump is associated with organized crime, he most likely runs or assists with child trafficking and prostitution, etc.</p>

<p>But I did not know any of that at the time. And trump did not say anything about war. So, he got my vote. </p>

<p>Maybe the DNC should stop rigging their elections and Bernie would be our president. Do you think that&#39;s a good idea, to stop rigging elections? Because the DNC just elected more of the same old for their new DNC chair. </p>

<p>This is all a bunch of fuckery and you all, DNC and GOP, are a bunch of fuckers.</p>

<p>I never believed it was Russia and I never will. All the proof I need is the media pushing a narrative and the official government backing that narrative with bullshit. Why all the bullshit, why no proof from my government? Because their liars and full of shit. </p>

<p>Maybe you don&#39;t &quot;know the truth.&quot; </p>

<p>I don&#39;t need to see a video of two US CIA agents discussing false hacks on the DNC. Then proof that the technology exists. The a copy of the software so I can run it to make sure it works. Then a video of the same agents actually doing the hacking. Then proof those agents worked at the CIA. Then proof they did it under the direction of the CIA. Then an official statement from the CIA stating that all this evidence is true. The a statement from the president saying wow this is shocking. Then proof that they sent the hacked info to Wikileaks, like photos of the printed documents and packaging. Then a confirmation from Wikileaks that this did occur. </p>

<p>You&#39;ll never be satiated with proof. We have more than enough already.</p>

<p>There is no &quot;if&quot; the deep state wants to go to war. It is as plain as the fraudulent stink on all of this neo-McCarthyism. I do not believe in any of the military effort at this stage. But the aggression against Russia, the insanely obvious bullshit they&#39;re trying to pour on our heads via pretty much of all of the mainstream media...  There is no doubt amongst the thinking, truth-seeking citizens. WE ARE BEING SET UP. Nothing new, except Russia and the US will end up killing the entire planet with this escalation. Sure, absolutely insert whichever other psychopathic regime Trump&#39;s administration threatens. Just a little research shows how blatant the deceit of the Russia hacking is. </p>

<p>Ron Paul had certainly the right idea - end the Fed. Every military action has been funded through the fed and/or Bank of England. The central banks are literally the heart of the beast. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The majority of voters who even bothered to vote chose Clinton, the minority chose Trump, and everyone got screwed one way or another. Even Trump himself, who was displeased with the final results of the election, even though he won. Well, the US and its allies, anyway. Our adversaries must be yucking it up over the fact that Trump has barely even begun to assert control over critical departments like State and DoD. Who knows, though, maybe it&#39;s for the best that he hasn&#39;t begun to fill all the needed appointments... because of the chance that he&#39;s compromised. What a time to be alive.</p>
