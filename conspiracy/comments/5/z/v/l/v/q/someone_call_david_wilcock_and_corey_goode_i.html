<p>I saw something on the moon, and watched it for hours, testing with various lenses and zoom.</p>

<p>I showed the photos to friends and family, casually.</p>

<p>All with the same reaction of &quot;What is that?&quot;.</p>

<p>It made me nervous having the photos, but I finally decided to post them.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s the video of the photos I made this evening. </p>

That would rule out bias, dirt in your scope, objects between your scope and the moon, etc.</p>

<p>My telescope doesn&#39;t self track, it&#39;s manual adjustment, because I like the constant tweaking and focusing... It&#39;s part of the fun.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Probably just a crater with lighting reflecting off of the &#39;dirt&#39; or whatever is on the surface. I have no idea the reflective properties of lunar dirt, nor do I think anyone here does. If the moon can appear white at night, what makes bright white spots on what appears to be a canyon or crater out of the ordinary? Just pause it at 4:22 and tell me how out of the ordinary from it&#39;s surroundings look. </p>

Show them to people when I could, without mentioning the object, and let them see for themselves, and see what they thought. </p>

<p>edit: very likely to be Mons Gruithuisen Gamma and Mons Gruithuisen Delta or NW</p>

<p>Two mountain peaks seems the logical conclusion - only visible when the moon is in a specific position relative to the Earth/Sun, and when these mountain bases at just over the horizon, but the peaks are still being illuminated by the sun.</p>

<p>If some civilization has the technology to build a very large base on the Moon, it seems unlikely they would make the mistake of building it to be visible from Earth.</p>

But who would be most interested in your pics and video is a YouTube channel called Secureteam10, who discusses and &quot;investigates&quot; these kind of lunar moon pics for many years.  They have an email to contact on their channel description.<br/>
Great job on the video &amp; pics! I&#39;ve seen so many videos showing things that look like bases and craft exiting the moon that I&#39;m a believer.</p>
