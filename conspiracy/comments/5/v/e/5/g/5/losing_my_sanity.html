<p>I&#39;ve been aware for a very long time about how corrupt our monetary system is..</p>

<p>But the recent discussions on universal basic income and automation has sprung this all upon me again.
I can&#39;t even get my head on straight in the morning.</p>

<p>Between researching the history of the petrodollar and the shit they do to continue their grasp on humanity...I just feel so overwhelmed and helpless?</p>

<p>The entire idea of universal basic income will lead to a mass reduction in population and a new age of feudalism.</p>

<p>we will go from being tax cattle, to a burden upon our owners.</p>

<p>How the fuck does anyone else deal with this type of reality check? I feel like I&#39;m losing my fucking sanity.</p>

<p>Other days, I&#39;ve hopped on the bike and pedaled around town. If you don&#39;t have a bike, get one (I didn&#39;t bike over the weekend cuz I live around a lot of hills and I didn&#39;t feel like pedaling up them, LOL).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;ll happen... but it&#39;ll happen within an adaptive timescale.  We&#39;ll go through a whole generation of babysitting machines, and then in 50 years, maybe, there will be some non-babysitting machines... but because it won&#39;t have happened so fast to be disruptive, it&#39;ll all settle out.</p>

<p>You can&#39;t plan that far into the future.  People might decide they want artisan things created by woodworkers, for instance.  These things tend to work out.</p>

<p>If you read Kurt Vonnegut&#39;s &quot;Player Piano&quot; it&#39;s a good example of automation hysteria-- in the 1950s.  But the whole book didn&#39;t take into consideration the fact that new inventions create new maintenance.</p>

<p>We have access to an infinite amount of information, with almost instantaneous retrieval times.</p>

<p>Were our minds created to be able to cope with this massive onslaught of information? No. Humans are inherently irrational and can only process so much.</p>

<p>Consider the progression: a modern human has access to the same amount of reliable information as the President of the U.S. did in the 1980s. </p>

<p>Most of what you read on the internet and fringe websites is false. By reading massive walls of text, those with little knowledge can become overwhelmed.</p>

<p>The remedy of this is simple: stop visiting the internet and get out. Think happy thoughts. Socialize.</p>

<p>More importantly, when you do come back to the digital realm, visit some academic websites. The long, stony prose with impecably-sources material devoid of mind-numbing sensationalist claims will soothe you and snap you back to reality. Also considering visiting some debunking forums, like <a href="http://www.metabunk.org">www.metabunk.org</a>.</p>

<p>“So do not be afraid of them, for there is nothing concealed that will not be disclosed, or hidden that will not be made known.  What I tell you in the dark, speak in the daylight; what is whispered in your ear, proclaim from the roofs.  Do not be afraid of those who kill the body but cannot kill the soul. Rather, be afraid of the One who can destroy both soul and body in hell.  Are not two sparrows sold for a penny? Yet not one of them will fall to the ground outside your Father’s care.

    <div class="md"><p>From the man himself : Alan Greenspan, who served as Fed Chair for 19 years, was asked in an interview what he thought the relationship between the Federal Reserve Chief and the President of the United States should be. His reply was shockingly candid.</p>

<p>“First of all, the Federal Reserve is an independent agency, and that means basically that there is no other agency of government which can overrule actions that we take. So long as that is in place... then what the relationships are don’t frankly matter.”</p>

    <div class="md"><p>OP, don&#39;t worry, we will achieve the denationalisation of money, otherwise known as <em>separation of money and state</em>. Crypto-currencies are the perfect medium of exchange, gold is the perfect store of value. Neither the government can ultimately control.</p>

<p>This &quot;basic income&quot; thing, war on cash, etc. are futile attempts of TPTBs to halt their inevitable demise. The new age will be an age of decentralization and freedom. The age of John Galt. Of individuals unilaterally separating from the monolithic power structure.</p>

<p>I could tell you much, much, more, but I suspect you know already a lot.</p>

<p>I hope crypto-currencies really do take hold in this country, I hope it really is inevitable and not just futile attempts..</p>
