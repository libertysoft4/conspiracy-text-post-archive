<p>whe i was young i keep doing the same dream over and over. im in old style clothes with some kind of train hat. i ride a bike with a big wheel in front. im riding down a big rocky slope. to my right is a ravine. i can see trees. on my left is the mountain. i hit some bigger then normal rock on this stupid road. my bike break and i drop the cliff. i tumble and tumble and crash on the ground. i die on impact and there i wake up in my bed. just to fall asleep and repeat over and over. </p>

<p>over the years i somehow got used to dieing over and over. there is no light like people say. no good feeling. only darkness. but you do feel lighter for a moment. </p>

<p>Not as woke. Don&#39;t get the whole 11 thing.</p>

<p>But this is a very special thing indeed. Keep him talking about the memories and the experiences. It sounds like you haven&#39;t told him he&#39;s only imagining things, which, at this point, I think is appropriate. </p>

<p>Not saying your kids gonna have superpowers, and that it doesn&#39;t suck that it&#39;s out of yr control, but don&#39;t assume this is bad just yet. Keep him talking about it. Like dreams, they become more lucid the more you record/communicate them. </p>

<p>They communicate telepathically and what&#39;s popping in for me is this one showed up to jump-start latent talents/gifts your son has. </p>

<p>They typically only visit when a request for a connection has been put out there; I&#39;m assuming your son is too young to have done that, so it could&#39;ve been a pre-arranged and agreed upon visit. </p>

<p>It might come back in a similar manner or it might visit in dreamtime going forward. If it does dreamtime visits, your son will recall those visits as clearly as if he&#39;d been awake for them. One other possibility is the visit was to be the catalyst to get your attention and get you investigating and/or asking for a visit as they&#39;ve not been able to reach you so far. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Standing up good, I hope. Really. There&#39;s nothing to be frightened of. </p>

<p>I get what you&#39;re feeling right now. It&#39;s a trip the first time something happens, especially if it&#39;s unexpected and it&#39;s outside the scope of your interests/studies or things you thought possible. Add in the thoughts you have wondering who to talk to and/or how to begin to explain it without sounding like the cheese melted and is actively running off your cracker and it&#39;s a total mind-bending trip. </p>

<p>Graham Hancock is a good place to start. Maybe ask your son to draw a picture(s) of each of the memories the orb gave him; that&#39;ll help him to focus in on each one specifically and allow details he doesn&#39;t have words for. It&#39;ll also make it so he can tell you about it easier as he&#39;ll have a reference point for describing things. </p>

<p>The best thing you can do right now is to follow your intuition. Orb visits of this nature are unique, so use care in allowing anyone (including me) to tell you what something means. You&#39;ll know when something rings true; when it does, it&#39;s part of the info you&#39;re seeking finding its way to you. If it doesn&#39;t ring true or feel right, toss it in the trash and continue on. </p>

<p>Consider sending a message out to your son&#39;s new friend; it&#39;s only right to know who your son&#39;s interacting with and they know that. It&#39;s probable the orb is hanging out nearby and is already aware of things that&#39;ve taken place since it was last visible as they can pop in/out of our visual range like a light being turned on/off. </p>

<p>If you want it to visit you, give it permission to pay you a visit and/or communicate with you, too. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Another good book to read is Dead Men&#39;s Secrets by Johnathon Gray. It outlines actual physical evidence that has been collected, photographed, and/or catalogued throughout history that doesn&#39;t fit the status quo, e.g. the narrative. From what I read, there&#39;s more that doesn&#39;t fit than does. The Smithsonian only shows about 2% of their entire inventory, who knows what the other 98% includes. Plus, there are citations out the wazoo so anyone can look up the majority of items that weren&#39;t already destroyed.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Where is this information coming from? </p>

<p>I ask because of an experience I had about 20 years ago... I don&#39;t think I have ever written about it before and have only spoke about it to my wife.</p>

<p>I was asleep on a couch in an old house out in the country my wife&#39;s family owns. I was visiting there with my wife (girlfriend at the time) and her family. I was disturbed on the couch and woke with a feeling of extreme anxiety and was trying to go beck to sleep. I started to hear something... a sound I can explain in no other way except it sounded like a green crystal and it suddenly became so loud that I couldn&#39;t even move. I felt as if I was encased by the sound in a green crystal. Even though I was overwhelmed by this there was no fear and it was actually more of a comfort and it removed my anxiety and filled my mood with joy and feelings of love and peace. Suddenly it was gone. I sat up on the edge of the couch and thought to myself... surely that did not just happen.  I convinced myself it was a dream and proceeded to have the best couch sleep I have ever had.</p>

<p>I have always assumed this was a dream... but what your saying intrigues me. I did get the feeling that whatever this was was an intelligent thing that was &quot;helping&quot; me in some way... maybe even protecting me from something somehow.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>How cool that you had that experience. That it&#39;s stayed with you all this time speaks volumes to the &quot;realness&quot; of what took place and what it still means to you. :) </p>

<p>When I address these topics, it&#39;s a combo of learning, experience, and what I hear as I&#39;m reading. If it&#39;s primarily something I&#39;m hearing, I&#39;ve learned to get out of the way and let those words come through.</p>

<p>If you&#39;re curious about what happened, it&#39;s okay to ask for additional info. The answer might not come right away, but it&#39;s likely to stop you in your tracks when it does pop in. We have a lot of helpers and friends around who are waiting to be given the okay to provide additional info, assistance, etc. The key is to consciously acknowledge it as they can&#39;t participate without permission. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I told you as best I could. There were a few different things in the reply, so if there&#39;s something specific, please ask and I&#39;ll do my best to answer. :)</p>

<p>As I said, it&#39;s through things I&#39;ve learned. Things I&#39;ve experienced. And what I hear and/or pops in as I&#39;m reading and/or responding. </p>

<p>To clarify, my inner hearing has been a constant since I was a child; if someone isn&#39;t being truthful whether intentional or not, I get an inner monologue of what they actually mean that happens simultaneously as they speak. In addition to that, I get what I describe as &quot;thwacks&quot; of insight; they&#39;re like lightening bolts of knowledge that doesn&#39;t come from me and when it happens, it&#39;s a direct hit for the recipient while I&#39;m not sure of what I just conveyed. </p>

<p>It sounds whackadoo. I get that. I&#39;ve lived with it all my life and came to terms with it years ago. Similarly, there&#39;ve been some experiences over the years that&#39;ve rocked me to my core because things like that don&#39;t happen (but they do). Trying to research this stuff pre-internet was a beast, yet the info I needed managed to find it way to me as did people who could fill in a blank and/or point me in a new direction to learn more stuff. To say where I got a lifetime&#39;s worth of info, without a specific question, is difficult. </p>
