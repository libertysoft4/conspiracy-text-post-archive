    <div class="md"><p>Right after the election I had told some friends that we dodged a bullet. If it had been Hillary we would be at war with Russia. A war we cannot possibly win, and perhaps by design. (Obama decimated the military and the leadership.) By electing Trump we were still going to have &quot;war&quot; but it would be internal, and as a society asleep at the wheel happily and blindly consuming but conveniently ignoring the actions of our government, it was time to clean up our act and pay the piper. I told them that &quot;THEY&quot; would not go quietly into that dark night as there was too much at stake. They laughed at me then. They&#39;re not laughing now.</p>

<p>Whether or not a person is on the Trump train, there is plenty of freely available information to expose to anyone who actually cares to look, what a vile POS our government is.</p>

<p>I can be a proud American as a person, and still be faithful to the values that helped make us a formerly free country, have faith in most of my fellow Americans..that they too would want the corruption exposed, our war mongering and perpetual interference to be ended. For us to actually BE our words. WOW was I wrong. I&#39;m witnessing people so devoted to tearing things apart that the truth has become revolutionary. Up is down, black is white, good is evil. I feel like I&#39;ve entered into Bizarro World.</p>

<p>No matter our personal feelings we should be working together to solve this instead of attacking each other.</p>

<p>I cannot honestly (and I&#39;ve tried) find anything Trump has ever said or done in his entire life, that will ever come close to be as evil as the email telling Hillary to embrace the murder of Qaddafi and destruction of Libyia all the way to the White House to prove she&#39;s tough. </p>

<p>WTF? We have destroyed Libya, for what? What was our right to do that? They&#39;ve been playing games with our lives and getting away with it for much too long and our gullibility in blindly following where ever they told us to go is ridiculous. </p>

<p>What possible excuse can anyone offer for hating Trump more than they hate the lies we&#39;ve been fed?</p>

<p>We had the &quot;left&quot; screaming about rape culture, slut shaming, body shaming,..who then turned around and attacked Melania Trump for having been a drop dead gorgeous super model, marching with &quot;Rape Melania&quot; signs..now rape is good.</p>

<p>We had the &quot;left&quot; publishing VERY pro pedophilia articles, no one said a word when Lena talked about sexually abusing her sister, no worries, no shame...then Milo talks about being sexually abused in a way that&#39;s easiest for him to express it, and suddenly he&#39;s a dangerous pedo and they hate pedos.</p>

<p>No matter what it is, no matter if it&#39;s true, it will be attacked and retrofitted because someone hates Trump.</p>

<p>I watched Tucker try to get this Nevertrump protest guy to actually explain why he&#39;s afraid of Trump. I&#39;m still waiting to hear why people are choosing to be terrified of Trump.  Trump got elected because he promise to enforce our immigration laws. This is a good thing. If that pisses people off, so be it. I wouldn&#39;t get any &quot;mercy&quot; being illegal in Mexico. Open Borders? How is it open borders if the traffic is only one way? The last thing Mexico wants is open borders. </p>

<p>The political asshattery is off the charts. The mayor of my city went public stating we were a sanctuary city. That&#39;s a lie. They&#39;re nabbing illegals left and right. I was SO happy to discover that the 2 times deported felon that robbed me and a friend was caught..and immediately shipped out. This time he won&#39;t be coming back. I&#39;m happy about that.</p>

<p>California spends 25billion dollars a year supporting illegal aliens. They rioted, screamed, made plans to exit the union. And have had the NERVE to blame the flooding on Trump and demand federal dollars. I realize the bulk of the area flooding is red zones, which does cause one to wonder if the neglect to that area was purposeful. They don&#39;t need a high speed train. They need to fix their infrastructure and clean the trash out of their crime ridden ghettos. I heard a Senator the night they evacuated Orville the first time, actually turn it into Trump&#39;s fault. He said something like &quot;Well Mr. President, instead of deporting immigrants maybe you should be building us a new dam&quot;. I about dropped my teeth. I&#39;m MORE than pleased our President has not said a word about California. He released FEMA funds, but I surely hope he never says another word. The destruction alone that California has committed upon itself needs to rest firmly on the head of Californians who got all cozy with the way things were, and just let it all ride. Now is the time to pay the piper for being asleep at the wheel. And the nerve of that state threatening the rest of the country because like petulant children they didn&#39;t get their way. Good riddance. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m sure if you work hard enough you can find a number you can be comfortable with.</p>

<p>Illegal aliens are not disenfranchised Americans. They are illegal aliens and citizens of other countries and one can tell that because they are continually waving the flags of other countries and demanding their rights. For the unschooled, Illegal Aliens have NO Constitutional rights. They have &quot;human rights&#39; which means we can&#39;t roll them up in cement and toss them in the ocean, but WE THE PEOPLE OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA=citizens. Period. You want open borders? Nice. Please enter into negotiations with both Mexico and Canada on how they need to open their borders. Maybe Americans can pop down to Mexico and make it great...for the first time. </p>

<p>It is not my responsibility to clear up Mexico. My responsibility was to vote for a candidate that is going to clean up MY country.</p>

<p>They&#39;re right, President Trump is NOT their president.</p>

<p>Open those borders. I&#39;m happy to buy up some primo land at rock bottom prices and settle in Mexico. I&#39;ll start a business and put some Mexicans to work. No one ever really wants to go to Canada.

<p>An estimated 3 million illegal aliens voted in California alone. LOL i watched an Aussie register to vote in California via his phone. OMG of course they voted. Why are people acting so stupid? I about died when that illegal deported 6 times complained she didn&#39;t do anything illegal. Oh, peanut, I dunno, how about driving? I hope this spring is full of illegal alien garage sales. Once you get caught and deported you cannot come legally :) So best to deport yourself and try legally. That&#39;s a better chance than nothing. :D Plus, think of all the family reunions! </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Great write-up. I would say, in response to the &quot;people choosing to be terrified of Trump,&quot; I would say the public/youth response would be far less volatile had the media taken one single fucking measure to rationally explain the state of the world to people instead of whipping everybody into a fucking frenzy for ratings.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t even. I don&#39;t understand how AMERICAN women can cheer Linda Sansour who is an unabashed Sharia law advocate and a BFF to Hamas, and ALLAH AKBAR at the tops of their lungs (then bitch b/c Melania read the Lord&#39;s Prayer) and have that monster Donna Hilton, who murdered a man by shoving a metal pipe up his ass and claiming it was justified because he wiggled when it went it therefore he must be gay. And marching about wearing vaginas? WTAF? Oh hey gramma can you tell me about the time you wore a vagina and marched against human and women&#39;s rights and cheered a murderer?</p>

<p>Resonant disconnect...and if you bring it up, they only retort is OMG ur so raciss, bigoted, xenophobic Hilter. </p>

<p>Look, the media surely did whip things up, but I&#39;m sorry, I&#39;ve never in my life let the media dictate what I do. People are responsible for their own behavior. There&#39;s way too little of that. </p>

<p>Why are you afraid? BECAUSE TRUMP....because what? I wouldn&#39;t have voted for him if he were antigay, but I&#39;m damn pleased he&#39;s set the bathroom issue straight. Mentally ill persons do not have the right to drive policy. They need help, not encouragement. And no one should ever bully or harm someone who is mentally ill. We&#39;ve got an entire generation of kids raised in day care by harried workers whose only interest was in creating calm cooperative collective behavior. </p>

<p>I have had enough of the racist shit. 2% of white Americans owned slaves, but 17% of blacks who could, owned slaves. Africans sold their captives into slavery. I&#39;m sick of idiot academics who haven&#39;t left their office in 20 years dreaming up asshattery like &quot;it&#39;s racist to read to your kids&quot;, <a href="http://www.abc.net.au/radionational/programs/philosopherszone/new-family-values/6437058">http://www.abc.net.au/radionational/programs/philosopherszone/new-family-values/6437058</a></p>

<p>it&#39;s racist to use good grammar...</p>

<p><a href="http://heatst.com/culture-wars/university-of-washington-writing-guru-declares-american-grammar-racist-and-unjust/">http://heatst.com/culture-wars/university-of-washington-writing-guru-declares-american-grammar-racist-and-unjust/</a></p>

<p>Stop making excuses for people who fail their kids and who are not intelligent enough or don&#39;t care to learn to speak, read and write proper English and know how/when to use it. If it puts them at a disadvantage so be it. </p>

<p>We pander to stupid trying to make everyone feel good and sideline intelligent people...and we&#39;ve landed ourselves smack dab in the middle of an Idiocracy. (Watch it if you haven&#39;t, it&#39;s prophetic.)</p>

I have tried and tried to get people I know IRL to explain why they are afraid. Why they are outraged. I get nothing but the excuse &quot;if you don&#39;t get it you are part of the problem&quot;. I can&#39;t fathom what happened from Nov. 7th to Nov 8th that turned me from a close friend/good neighbor/co-worker to mortal enemy #1 overnight. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve found that people need to be afraid &amp; angry. It gives them purpose in an otherwise mundane life. Got to see what the latest outrage on Facebook or twitter so they can get that blood boiling. Got get that daily online argument in so they feel smart &amp; included. This fear is fabricated, only the ones that are afraid don&#39;t know they are being made to feel that way. </p>

<p>I have been around long enough to understand if they are in the White House, they are somewhat dangerous. And I&#39;ve also been around long enough to know there&#39;s not damn thing we can do when the shit hits the fan. 
I don&#39;t think Trump is anymore dangerous than Clinton would have been. They all suck. </p>
