    <div class="md"><p>lol i&#39;m not. the original semites were arabs. even from the modern definition, arabs are also semites, thus the term anti-semetic doesnt mean shit. would have to be against all semites, which would include arabs. </p>

<p>modern jews have nothing to do with the ancient Israelites/Hebrews.
most modern jews are converts in the 8th century, they are a turkish people from the kingdom of Khazar. they later migrated north to germany, and east to former soviet land. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Late reply in the time of the internet&#39;s. But it&#39;s amazing that you bring up this topic.. 
There is an amazing story I was told by by grandma who happens to be an ashkenazi jew. She says most Jews are not in fact Semites. But in their teachings they are descendants of early hittites. The assyrians which you now know are Semites drove them from their lands many centuries ago. And while most modern jews are european and arab intermixed the term semite does not really apply to jews at all.. but rather syrians, iranians, the turks, and egyptians. 
Not trying to stir the pot but lend some family knowledge and teaching handed down over the years. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I will settle this once and for all. There&#39;s no need for DNA-tests, even though they also prove the semitic heritage of the Aschkenazis. The one and only bullet-proof test you need is your eyes. It&#39;s clear as day that they are semites.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>there is also DNA-tests that ties their DNA more closely to Europeans than to Middle-Easterners. And even those tests can be false depending on the premise, are they using contemporary populations as surrogates for ancient populations? if so then have to be skeptical of the tests because whose to say the contemporary populations are the same as the ancient populations. For example Egypt and Libya, the ancient population of those lands are not the same as the modern population. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree, that&#39;s why I said DNA doesn&#39;t matter, because just by looking at them they are obvious semites. Sure they have European heritage, but that&#39;s also my point: the Khazar theory is worthless. You didn&#39;t mention it so it&#39;s not directed to you, but rather to everyone who always bring it up. Many even imply they are part of us Europeans, but I will never accept that.</p>

<p>Now that I think of it, you didn&#39;t say anything wrong. It is actually true that arabs are truer semites, since they are less mixed. I&#39;m just tired of the Khazar myth popping up all the time, it&#39;s detrimental for us Europeans. Also, I&#39;m sceptical to DNA-science, I don&#39;t think we should rely on that because it will be used against us.</p>

<p>That should have been his opening statement. &quot;I am a Jew hating Anti-Semite and I hate Alex Jones&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>yeah and from all the of times i&#39;ve seen it thrown around just for criticizing Israel. </p>

<p>says me and a former senator of the good state of Texas, Mark Dankof.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Finally, I will simply say that the utilization of the term “anti-Semitism” as a politically weaponized canard is an attempt to conceal what I believe the truth to be about the doctrine of Jewish racial supremacist ideology as the philosophical underpinning for land thievery, terrorism, and genocide in Palestine, along with the systematic concealment of the evidence of overwhelming Jewish financial and political support in the United States and Europe for fiat money and central banking; globalist trade treaties; Israel’s usurpation of American foreign policy; the overwhelmingly Jewish ownership position in the major media consortiums operating in the West; the amount of Jewish and pro-Israel PAC money routinely buying American Presidential elections and Congressional seats and committee assignments on Capitol Hill; and the provably disproportionate role played by Jewish interests in promoting the Cultural Marxism which has engulfed the United States and Western Europe in my lifetime, especially in the advancement of the LGBT agenda, the abortion industry, the pornography industry, and so forth</p>
</blockquote>

<p>and i can go and find plenty of other people who say the same, anti-semite is used to end debates. </p>

    <div class="md"><p><strong>DISCLAIMER</strong> I have nothing against Jews in particular, I hate every group that tries to be special inside a larger group. So yes that includes all religions and more. </p>

<p>Loads of shills here, Come on let&#39;s not pretend that the Jewish people are the most <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/5uf04y/alexandr_solzhenitsyns_quote_on_the_russian/ddtph7f/?context=3">innocent</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNPuXcN9QhY">prosecuted</a> humans on the globe. They would like to think so and would love make us think the same.</p>

<p>As for Alex Jones, He&#39;s sometimes has decent stories, often stolen from this sub, but for the most part it&#39;s shit. He&#39;s had Jewish ties for a long time. He droped pizzagate but after it got enough fans picked it up again. He&#39;s nothing but a guy that wants to get rich. He&#39;s not out there to inform you, only you can inform you.</p>

<p>It&#39;s funny that no one here seems to see a link between Trump, Alex and Israel. Why is there no JIDF on the_Donald, Why is Alex suddenly near the white house, why was Trump giving an interview with Netanyahu about greater Israel, a 1 state solution for the middle east that include a great territory and many nation with Israel leading it all. This means that Iran will be attacked and deals where made with Russia and China, Iran&#39;s allies, China gets Taiwan Russia keeps Crimea. all for the glory of Israel. But why are the American Jews still against Trump, they know what will happen they are not stupid people. My only guess is that they use Trump to get rid of Iran and afterward they can dump him because the chance from a backlash, for the USA Jews and Israel, about a war with Iran is too risky (imagine all those  angry mobs after few years of real war with Iran all trying to point fingers while millions are dead).</p>

<p>Oh for those that think the Jews did 9-11</p>

<p>Yes but also Christians and Muslims it was one big happy USA ISRAEL SAUDI project and of course USA was leading it. the question is who? George bush Sr? He is after all, the great CIA man.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The key will be when Paul Craig Roberts and other credible people find somewhere else to hang.    There aren&#39;t that many channels for people to go to.    That&#39;s one reason r/conspiracy is so great,  you can find stuff here from all over.    Another good choice is Zero Hedge.</p>

<p>Jimmy Dore has also started bringing on credible people.    James Corbett is consistently good.    Sibel Edmonds tries hard,  is not a kook or a liar.   Redacted Tonight is more sensational shit,  just adding more noise to a crowded misinformed attempt to cash in on a popularity contest where the lowest common denominator has to be included in order to make a buck.    Notice how Dennis Kucinich,  who is no fool,  went on FOX recently to make a rare announcement.    Its strange out there,  but I can see why he did it,  considering the alternatives.    FOX is better than Alex Jones!!!   Weird.</p>

<p>But yeah,  Alex Jones is a problem for the truth movement.     People need to boycott that shit.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes I had the same concerns.</p>

<p>It is strange that a man (Alex) who&#39;s so into conspiracies can&#39;t see the link between globalism, media control and JEWs.</p>

<p>I also don&#39;t understand why he&#39;s defending israel so much lately....like on one hand he bashes on globalist which are mostly jews...but then defends the israel state...wtf?!?!</p>

<p>This been said, if he dared to talk somehow about the jews, the mainstream media would have had used it against him. Which is maybe the reason why he doesn&#39;t. b/c nothing is worst on this world than been anti-semite.</p>
