        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I&#39;m looking for eyewitness accounts of this supposed day where the queen accidentally revealed herself to be of reptilian decent in front of a massive crowd in London! The internet has been scrubbed of all accounts and I would LOVE to hear from anyone who was there that day, or who maybe saw, first-hand, the royal family&#39;s website press release article discussing what everyone saw (that was immediately removed, but has been screen grabbed!) I want to believe this, but struggle with the lack of evidence other than a rather fake looking screen grab of the &quot;royal website&quot;.. Please, anyone who has any knowledge of this day, or if you were there, or know someone who was there and saw everything, or even just saw the website article with your own eyes, respond here or e-mail me; I can post it once I get some comments on here! No spam or you will be blocked and deleted! Thanks again! -AMG</p>

    <div class="md"><p>someone posted one above, but it&#39;s very hard to find any proof behind it, and google doesn&#39;t really show much other than a link to a site that isn&#39;t so reputable.. but i know i have read articles about it before, they just seemed to vanish so that&#39;s why i figured reddit would be the way to go with digging deeper into everything; this has puzzled me for a while now and i want to get some proof to see because this seems like something that legitimately happened and legitimately scared a lot of people, twitter trends are great ways to see what is occuring in the masses quickly, so the fact that something like that blew up online during her public event right there just tells you that something really did frighten those thousands of people and i want to know why nobody has come forward with proof.. is it out of loyalty and respect to the empire? do the english not care if they are led by a non-human entity? it seems very likely from the tone of that press release!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>guys, i&#39;m calling complete bullshit now on this entire story and that website and everything; they just started circling THE EXACT SAME STORY.. but just switched out the queen for caitlyn jenner!! same deal - missing twitter profiles and screenshots of &quot;disappearing tweets&quot; and some secret, &quot;high-profile&quot; source, who chose to remain anonymous, who saw these tweets disappear before his/her eyes and managed to get some screen shots before they were all gone... IT&#39;S THE SAME FUCKING STORY!! what a sham; sorry to everyone who was seriously curious about this post because it seems as though we have been duped again by another unreliable website with random, shock journalism with zero known sources or photographic evidence!! one story of such widespread viewing of high-profile shapeshifting was difficult enough to believe already.. this just made it 10 times harder -___-</p>

<p>Refound the video I tried to post. </p>

<p>It&#39;s not a video of the Queen Shapeshifting, but! It is an interesting video, and after this discussion, i can understand why it&#39;s called what it is.</p>

<p>Just take a peek - it&#39;s definitely putting me into a bit of a hole to research this John Walson guy.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Let me propose this. We are living in times were people&#39;s ability to achieve clairvoyance has become greater. There is a consciousness shift going on. What everyone in the crowd saw was her astral body which reveals what she is inside, a cold Ahrimanic demonic being or she is just possessed by one. The lizard theory is way to simplistic but not entirely devoid of truth. This story to me is more proof of this consciousness shift than Elizardbreath II! Think about it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>guys, i&#39;m calling complete bullshit now on this entire story and that website and everything; they just started circling THE EXACT SAME STORY.. but just switched out the queen for caitlyn jenner!! same deal - missing twitter profiles and screenshots of &quot;disappearing tweets&quot; and some secret, &quot;high-profile&quot; source, who chose to remain anonymous, who saw these tweets disappear before his/her eyes and managed to get some screen shots before they were all gone... IT&#39;S THE SAME FUCKING STORY!! what a sham; sorry to everyone who was seriously curious about this post because it seems as though we have been duped again by another unreliable website with random, shock journalism with zero known sources or photographic evidence!! one story of such widespread viewing of high-profile shapeshifting was difficult enough to believe already.. this just made it 10 times harder -___-</p>
