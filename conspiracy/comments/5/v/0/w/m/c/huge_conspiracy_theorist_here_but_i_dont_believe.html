    <div class="md"><p>They definitely believe. The CIA believes. The Vatican believes. The Jesuits believe. The Zionist believe. The Bilderbergs believe. The Royals believe. They are quite literally satanists and luciferians. Whether you understand what that means, I have no idea. But it&#39;s all very real.</p>

<p>I&#39;m just saying for the perspective of a Muggle, it doesn&#39;t matter that they are practicing blood ritual and trauma mind control in the name of Moloch, or whatever the entity is they recognize. They is enough reason to suspect them of horrible things and to investigate them regardless.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>there is plenty of evidence.. its under the guise of pizza gate.. </p>

<p>the concept of them being satanists is just the same as a christian believing in christ as god but going to war for him; or muhammed. </p>

<p>the real thing to acknowledge is that very high up people are doing FUCKED OFF shit to the youth of the world. </p>

<p>Another thing to recognize is that beneath most of these stories is a root that is true to the ground it is planted in while it grows marshmallows for leaves and has a licorice trunk. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>There is nothing inherently &quot;bad&quot; or &quot;evil&quot; about magick and the occult. Just like with technology, it can be used for &quot;good&quot; or &quot;evil&quot; depending on the practicioner. There is also nothing supernatural about magick...it&#39;s just a bunch of techniques for meditation/self-empowerment and psychology that people can potentially use to manipulate others or themselves in different ways.</p>

<p>I think a lot of people who are religious tend to believe in the supernatural, and thus they believe in the potential of &quot;black magick&quot; to control others or cause harm to others like voodoo dolls or something. These same people view ALL such practices as inherently evil since it conflicts with their own belief systems such as a monotheistic belief in a &quot;god&quot; who is inherently &quot;good&quot; and omnipotent and should be the only one in control of the fate of mankind. </p>

<p>TLDR: You&#39;re right, it&#39;s very silly. But I don&#39;t think it&#39;s entirely a disinfo campaign or anything. I think there are a lot of weak-minded individuals who strongly believe in it. There&#39;s an entire &quot;doomsday prophecy&quot;/hardcore religious sect to the conspiracy community who tend to focus more on the spiritual nature than the historical/factual aspect of conspiracies.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Have you ever studied or practiced magick yourself? Like I said, there&#39;s nothing supernatural about it. It may work for some people and not for others just like meditation or self-help books might work for some and not for others. We all function differently and can draw benefit from different techniques for self-improvement whether it being going to see a shrink or going to church each week and saying a prayer to &quot;god&quot;.

    <div class="md"><p>I believe you might be right, however, I think it&#39;s important to focus on <em>what we know</em>. If we know about organized ritual abuse (child trafficking etc.) whether or not it falls under the purview of &quot;Occultism&quot; or just &quot;Sick Shit&quot; should hardly matter.</p>

<p>So yes, the scientific approach to discovering the truth (especially concerning topics the TPTB don&#39;t want us to know) is certainly the best path forward.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well right off the bat I can tell you that most these occult circles are a front for other things. For example, many (most?) satanists don&#39;t believe that satan does or ever did exist. Many people believe that this was confusion was beought about on purpose so that people associated satanism with devil worship. I would say mission accomplished.</p>

<p>They use him/her as a metaphor for free will, to be able to go down your own path and go againsts the system that was put in place by christianity and TPTB.</p>

<p>They believe that their own might and cunning should take precident over laws and regulations put there by others (kind of similar to what anarchists believe but with some fundamental differences).</p>

<p>Its much to big a subject to explain in a few paragraphs and its also off topic. What I am trying to get across is sometimes these things are not what they seem and that is, perhaps, intentional.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was torn on this for a long time.. but I think the issue is that science and occult stuff are one and the same. It&#39;s just how you look at it. To us the science stuff they are aware of that we aren&#39;t seems paranormal. Who knows what crazy stuff they are aware of that we aren&#39;t.</p>

<p>I will give you a great example.. rumors of these elites drinking blood and childrens blood - now look at this</p>

<p><a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-3939242/Do-teenageers-hold-ey-fountain-youth-Blood-human-teens-anti-aging-effects-old-mice.html">http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-3939242/Do-teenageers-hold-ey-fountain-youth-Blood-human-teens-anti-aging-effects-old-mice.html</a></p>

<p>The reason there are all these legends becoming true is because we have had this secret knowledge for thousands of years from lost societies and we are just now decoding it...  and we in the general population are way behind these elites...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You can say its a cover for organ harvesting and child fucking/drug running.</p>

<p>They&#39;ve been long connected. Cults running guns and drugs for cia, cults collecting kids, cults of mkultra varieties, etc, etc.</p>

<p>I think it&#39;s a &quot;club&quot; thing and many buy into it for real. It binds partners and associates in shady dealings, and it provides cover for on the ground dealings. But indoctrination is still indoctrination so even an lsd/scopolamine expert of mkultra stock can start truly believing the shit, i mean young blood does keep you healthy, and sacrifice a kid and get some stem cells or organs and live. So satan kept him alive, he has that shit in his head, he starts playing along. </p>

<p>But you&#39;re right, i dont think its been used solely for religion or evil, but a co-opted tool for the type of stuff these people have always done. Hell, the OSS used crowley, as did other intelligence agencies. It&#39;s just another arm of a beast grown too big. </p>
