        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Where is the anger and the posts freaking out that our PRESIDENT and his administration are casually making up terrorist attacks by migrants to push their narrative to the country? Since trump became president we now have the Bowling Green massacre that was invented by KellyAnne &quot;alternative facts&quot; Conway, non existent attacks in Atlanta, and the most embarrassing by the god emperor himself, inventing a migrant attack in Sweden of all places. </p>

<p>Yet no mentions of this in here? Does it not upset you that our president is not even using false flag attacks because he&#39;s too lazy to set that up, but just flat out making up stories so his supporters freak out about migrant terrorists flooding the country? </p>

<p>This could continue to be collusion with TPTB, using MSM as a scapegoat to all the lies being perpetrated, while making you feel more trust in Trump and his staff, only for them to push even crazier lies to the public in order to get their policies going. Wake up folks, our first wannabe dictator is emerging!!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Trump never mentioned a &quot;terrorist attack&quot; which is what all the media is going crazy about.  Trump referenced the situation in Sweden, which is a catastrophic immigration policy that has rendered their nation the &quot;rape capital of Europe&quot; and increasingly unsafe for citizens.  These crimes are being systematically underreported and avoid disclosing nationality under some misguided sense of &quot;humanity&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I would think he misspoke when referencing lasnight, as we all know, he&#39;s not as eloquent at public speaking as Obama was. I also don&#39;t think it&#39;s fair to conflate his remarks to some sort of attack, when he never explicitly mentioned one. What I do believe he was trying to reference are the massive amounts rape/violent crimes(FB live rape)being perpetrated on the people of Sweden by their uninvited guests. I&#39;d like to know where the fury over that, the real story is?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There&#39;s been a lot of fury over it, if you look for it. The problem is that though crime has increased...  you&#39;ve got two pools of people.</p>

<p>The first group understands that bringing a shitload of people in poverty into your country is going to increase crime. It&#39;s part of the short term process and only if/when these people don&#39;t assimilate or continue to commit crimes then we&#39;ll have a real problem.</p>

<p>The second group are OUTRAGED and make up debunked stories about roving rape gangs around Sweden to try to get more visibility to these increases in crime. Their hearts are in the right place but their approach is only making them look crazy and idiotic. Not to mention all the idiots who believe their stories.</p>

<p>What I&#39;m concerned about is if these Syrian refugees continue committing crimes in Sweden, there&#39;s really no humane thing to do with them. Send them back to Syria?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You and I both know the influx of 200k refugees to Sweden has made it an absolute hellhole. Every other day I&#39;m reading about a refugee raping or gang raping women. One woman was gang raped and they live streamed it over Facebook. Crime has skyrocketed and 70% of the prisoners are refugees. Do you not remember the story where police just told women to stay inside their homes in the evening because it&#39;s so dangerous on the streets? Sweden is now the rape capital of the world! Don&#39;t sit here and tell yourself any of that shit would be good for America.</p>

<p>Lol are you absolutely fucking kidding me? If Sweden is a hellhole, then what the fuck are North Korea, Democratic Republic of The Congo, Yemen, and Mauritania?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, you and I both don&#39;t know this. Anecdata but my girlfriend was in Sweden less than six months ago and had no problems whatsoever. Sweden was the safest cleanest country she visited and the places rife with crime were Italy and France.</p>

<p>Sweden has had very high rape numbers for a long time. Hilariously enough the only number I keep seeing cited is the one from the UNODC report from 2012 (because it was multinational I think?) even though that number is from before the influx of Syrian refugees.</p>

<p>What makes it even harder to know how much rape and sexual crime has gone up in Sweden is that in 2014 they broadened their definition of rape (again) so statistics are not going to match previous years.</p>

<p>With google translate you can get some more recent stats from here: <a href="http://www.bra.se/bra/brott-och-statistik/valdtakt-och-sexualbrott.html">http://www.bra.se/bra/brott-och-statistik/valdtakt-och-sexualbrott.html</a> which I&#39;m sure people won&#39;t believe since it&#39;s coming from Swedish law enforcement but whatever.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hahaha that&#39;s actual how I found this post, it&#39;s kind of funny that during the trump-Russian &quot;brigading&quot; post, it seemed all the users actively trying to fight that narrative, were running around trying to tell everyone to ignore the anti-trump post and go to controversial tab instead, even using the Voltaire quote <em>&quot;To learn who rules over you, simply find out who you are not allowed to criticize.&quot;</em> to support their argument....</p>

<p>They were trying to point out that during the brigade, most of the Clinton/dems/p-gate post were being downvoted to the controversial tab, but now during normal non-brigading sub traffic, the controversial tab tells a very different story and if that Voltaire quote holds true, it&#39;s very clear who we are not allowed to criticized... </p>

<p>It actually gets people to look and investigate for themselves, was there a specific incident in Sweden last night? No, but look at the broader picture, look at how entire cities have been turned into no-go zones where crime rates are at historic highs, due to the reckless immigration policy. </p>

<p>It raises awareness and I don&#39;t really care how it&#39;s done. These cases are not at all comparable to the monumental amount of lying done by the MSM and prior administrations. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think what we&#39;re seeing with stuff like &quot;the bowling green massacre&quot; and the other lists is not nefarious, but just a bad idea to try to make excuses for their hastily put together immigration plan.  </p>

<p>Bowling green has been joked about by everybody and it&#39;s not the same nefarious shit as, for example the FBI allowing terror attacks to happen for whatever reason as somebody posted about recently.  </p>

<p>The &quot;draw mohammad&quot; shooting in Garland Texas apparently had an FBI agent on site who&#39;d been in communication with the shooters.  I mean... that&#39;s pretty fucking disturbing tbh.  </p>

<p>Fake bombs are one thing.  The FBI is in control.  They give some dipshit a fake bomb.  They tell him put it somewhere, and then they arrest them.  </p>

<p>Dealing with guns and explosives though, that&#39;s far from controlled.  And the fact there was an FBI agent there before they arrived at the location... why didn&#39;t anybody stop them en route?  Or days before when they knew what they were up to and that they were armed?</p>
