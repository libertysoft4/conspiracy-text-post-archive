        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I sat down at my kitchen table staring at a bucket of change I earned as tips at my job,there are a couple of bills in it as well... thinking does the money we make or earn really belong to us? 
It came clear that it is in fact a false sense of security having coins and bank notes. We go to work on a daily basis and earn a wage or salary to see nothing but fictional numbers showing up on a digital screen telling you what your worth, and when we withdrawal from a bank or receive bank notes and coins in any way shape or form it makes us feel as though we have money but in reality it&#39;s nothing more then credit that you earned. If we truly owned this so called money there would be no laws on destruction of the money, but sadly their is laws prohibiting the destruction of it, they call it destruction of government property...not your property, Hense forth you do not own this currency we make transactions in a world of debt day by day recirculating this credit all over giving us a feeling of entitlement. But if as a person you were to bring this currency to the Capitol of your country and destroy it in front of your leader saying it belongs to you because you earned it, you would be disciplined for your actions, I  mean why is this the case if the money belongs to you, you should be able to do as you please, right? </p>

<p>Not that I&#39;m saying you should burn your earnings away but more to the fact does anything really belong to you if this is the case? </p>

<p>It&#39;s a harsh reality, and I would love to hear other people&#39;s thoughts upon the topic.. Thank you for taking the time to read my realization to reality. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Take a look at 18 U.S. Code § 331-332</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Whoever <strong>fraudulently</strong> alters, defaces, mutilates, impairs, diminishes, falsifies, scales, or lightens any of the coins coined at the mints of the United States, or any foreign coins which are by law made current or are in actual use or circulation as money within the United States; or</p>

<p>Whoever <strong>fraudulently</strong> possesses, passes, utters, publishes, or sells, or attempts to pass, utter, publish, or sell, or brings into the United States, any such coin, knowing the same to be altered, defaced, mutilated, impaired, diminished, falsified, scaled, or lightened—</p>

<p>Shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than five years, or both.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>(§332)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If any of the gold or silver coins struck or coined at any of the mints of the United States shall be debased, or made worse as to the proportion of fine gold or fine silver therein contained, or shall be of less weight or value than the same ought to be, pursuant to law, or if any of the scales or weights used at any of the mints or assay offices of the United States shall be defaced, altered, increased, or diminished through the fault or connivance of any officer or person employed at the said mints or assay offices, with a <strong>fraudulent intent</strong>; or if any such officer or person shall embezzle any of the metals at any time committed to his charge for the purpose of being coined, or any of the coins struck or coined at the said mints, or any medals, coins, or other moneys of said mints or assay offices at any time committed to his charge, or of which he may have assumed the charge, every such officer or person who commits any of the said offenses shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than ten years, or both.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>These laws only apply to destruction of currency with fraudlent intent and originated back from when federal currency actually contained the valuable metals that backed the currency. Criminals would scrape off small amounts of silver and other valuable metals off of each coin in their possession until they amassed a notable amount of said metal. Actions such as these are one of the many reasons that lead to centally backed currency. Today the law still applies to individuals such as counterfiters; counterfit bills are typically printed on bleached $1 bills so that the texture of the bill is less suspicious. </p>

<p>As far as I know, you are legally within your rights to burn as much money as you would like. I believe there is even a form you can fill out to report destroyed (technically, currency that is too worn out or damange to be circulatable) currency to the treausry and they will replace the destoryed currency with new bills.</p>

<p>I am not a lawyer but I work tangentally to legal regulation. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>extend your thinking further. money/currency is an abstract idea used for convenience in trading. but even beyond money, what do you think belongs to you? your house? your car? your clothes?</p>

<p>the idea of ownership is an illusion. nothing is owned. nothing &quot;belongs&quot; to anyone. 
The government likes to hold itself as the authority who dispenses property and privilege to desperate peons.
Nothing you use in your daily life is outside the influence of the government&#39;s clasp. the government holds itself as the one true owner of everything under the sun. </p>

<p>However, knowing the truth reveals their stupid game for what it is.</p>

<p>Possession is temporary. you can use something when you need, then you have to let it go. clinging to possession inevitably leads to loss at some point.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Actually this is not entirely correct. Yes the government gives the impression that everything is owned by them, but only if you consent to be an employee of its corporation.</p>

<p>Each one of us can choose to live in the natural world or the world on paper. We can switch back and forth if we want to depending on if it is a benefit to us. In the natural world, our the fruits of our labor is completely ours. When we create something it is us or a byproduct of the man. This is only true as long as we use the right frame of mind, and know how to operate in the natural world when dealing with the paper world.</p>

<p>The problem is we have been convinced that the paper world is all there is.  When you use the words of the paper world and act like a vehicle of that paper world you signal to the government that you are an employee of this corporation. You do this by claiming money as income and allow the government to tax what you believe is income as the role of a tax payer. If you ever get a letter from the IRS, it always says TAX PAYER. It never identifies you as a man or a women. It can only operate completely in the paper world and it can only interact with you when you identify as the role they have convinced you to play.</p>

<p>There are other ways to operate. I run an independent service to the community of the area in which I live. I consider the service relationship I have between myself and my customers as an exchange of property, I exchange by service (property) for money (property). I call it property exchange which is firmly grounded on the land as all property is instead of income which is related to the sea. </p>

<p>Now im not entirely correct when I claim property as money because money itself (currency) is a instrument of international commerce and the law in which it operates is maritime law or color of law. </p>

<p>The thing is, nobody is every going to make a verified claim in a court of record that my belief is wrong. The man or women who created the money would have to come to court prove me wrong and that would reveal the whole scam that the money system we currently operate under actual is designed to redistribute the wealth of country&#39;s into the hands of a few international banking cartels.</p>

<p>Now you are probably thinking that the courts would just roll over me regardless of this, and that might be true if you dont know how to move a case against the man or women who interferes with the rights of man. They do whatever they want, but someone is always accountable in the end because we live in a common law land and our commercial law requires compensation for any order or judgment to be carried out without the consent of that man. This means that if a judge wants to hold you regardless of the reason he is operating by contract. This whole system operates by contract expressed or implied. The thing is you can create contracts of your own. One such contract is a fee schedule, I have used them before and the work. When a judge is convinced he can interfere with your rights, all you need to do is convince him otherwise by a notice and fee schedule that basically says. &quot;Please produce a verified claim from a man or women that I have done wrong, if no claim is presented to this court, and no man or women comes to make a claim against I the man, it is my wish that I be released immediately. For every minute I am held against my will you john stevens who sometimes play the role of magistrate or judge will be charged 1 dollar.&quot; The judge cannot be held accountable, only the man can. Most people choose not to get into this kind of situation and it most cases the case will be dismissed due to lack of evidence. But in some cases or if they have a strong motive to get you they will actual convince men and women in positions of power to act unlawfully, then its up to that man or women to stand firm know know the law and how it applies to him and the role is is currently in.</p>

<p>The thing I want to get across to people is that there is this divine law, or unspoken law, when you act in a certain way based on a feeling of being right, there is something in play that favors you depending on what lessons you have to learn in life or how unjust your situation is. There are some people that can get cases dismissed and there are others that can never secure their rights in a court of law. I think it mostly has to do with the attitude of the man or women.</p>

<p>Most importantly learn your rights in common law, dont take everything you are given by society as the on and only correct answer, you will find a great many things that society tells is is incorrect and part of a program powerful people use to subjugate man.</p>
