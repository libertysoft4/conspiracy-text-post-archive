    <div class="md"><p>I wouldn&#39;t say hard evidence, at least enough to throw the cuffs on him at this point.  There are just a lot of oddities. Like the weird code that other pedos use that is used in tons of emails, the symbols that were linked to the declassified FBI doc in 2007, the &#39;fatherhood&#39; video, the band at that pizza shop that talked about pedophilia like &#39;everyone has their preferences&#39;, the weird art of little kids in diapers in his brother&#39;s house, the weird art routines that look like satanic rituals and so on.

    <div class="md"><p>Well none of those are owned by Tony Podesta.  They are works of art created by a woman whose art he does have in his home, which you can see on the walls in <a href="http://washingtonlife.com/2015/06/05/inside-homes-private-viewing/">this article</a> which are not of kids in their underwear. Is there other pictures of Tony Podesta&#39;s house where these pics are seen?</p>

<p>So I&#39;ll ask again, is there any actual evidence? I would love to get on board with this, but all I&#39;ve ever seen is a bunch of Da Vinci coding with no actual payoff. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Welp there was but that article I read was deleted so now I look like an idiot. He did own paintings like those and they were mentioned in the article, however it wasn&#39;t the main subject. It was an article from 10 years ago and they mysteriously deleted it when the pizzagate shit came out. But check out the fatherhood video. Do your own research. The one thing that is annoying to me is that he hasn&#39;t addressed the emails he hasn&#39;t addressed the videos to my knowledge, the only thing he has said about it, is that it is &#39;fake news&#39; and people should move along.

    <div class="md"><p>Well indeed. I&#39;m doing the research and I&#39;m presenting you with facts. You haven&#39;t really presented anything at all yet. You hope I&#39;m right and yet you keep perpetuating the story as if you&#39;re sure. </p>

<p>BTW, I read the WaPo article from 2004 as well as saw the accompanying picture that also did not contain anything odd. And also, for the record, the stories were both about Tony Podesta, not John. </p>

<p>Lastly, my mind is very much not made up but so far, you, nor the pizza party have shown or said anything other than what amounts to fanfic. I&#39;m asking you to help me nail this guy to the wall if he&#39;s indeed a satanic child molester. </p>

Maybe I&#39;ve lived in cities or have been on the internet too long but they&#39;re not even remotely shocking, gross or exploitative. </p>

<p>Jeffrey Epstein was a billionaire pedophile that had a sex slave island who Bill Clinton and Donald Trump were friends with. They both spent time on the &#39;Lolita Express&#39;, his private jet that ran to and from the island.

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>Yes I find the suburban teen photos disturbing. </p>

<p>Out of curiousity, what about them exactly? Maybe I&#39;ve been around art culture too long. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>When trump says he has been around these people for years and knows how corrupt they are do you think this is part of what he is talking about? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Which part? Pizzagate? Evidence surrounding him and real life convicted pedophiles is much more concrete than pizza logos and handkerchiefs. But when he&#39;s talking about corruption, no I don&#39;t think he&#39;s talking pizzagate. He&#39;s talking about politicians he&#39;s paid for, his cabinet, who&#39;ve all paid to him for their positions, and himself who is essentially charging rich business owners for access to him at Mar-A-Lago. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>If he is part of pedo shit I would lose all support for him that&#39;s for damned sure. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Again, there is a lot more concrete evidence that he is than that he isn&#39;t. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Also what do you think about Trumps plans to attack sex trafficking that happened today, making it known nationwide that it is a very real problem? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>I think every President in recent memory has made the same pledge. </p>

<p>I&#39;ve just found some people will refuse to believe they&#39;re not code words. So I figured the way it&#39;s worded (&quot;on pizza or pasta&quot;) makes it sound like if it&#39;s code for anything it&#39;d be drugs. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Great question.</p>

<p>As a pizzagate supporter; my concern isn&#39;t necessarily with Podesta/Alefantis but with the bigger picture of child trafficking being brought to people&#39;s attention.</p>

<p>Having said that, there is no legit evidence that Podesta likes kids. There are just several intriguing things. (his coded emails, his link to Comet with their pedo instagram &#39;humor&#39;, his and his family&#39;s art preferences, &quot;spirit cooking&quot;, his link to the Clintons and the emerging evidence of Clinton Foundation crimes, the McCann suspect sketches...). </p>

<p>&quot;Shit adds up&quot;, ya know?</p>

<p>For sure Podesta is a weirdo. Not for sure that Podesta likes or abuses kids.</p>

<p>Seems like it&#39;s worth investigating, though, doesn&#39;t it?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If it was my choice i dont think it rises to being worth investigating.  Each piece of evidence seems really shoddy.  </p>

<p>However im not bothered by anyone that wants to make an investigation happen.  I say if that&#39;s how you feel then push it.  What does seem scary to me is how many people have already concluded he&#39;s a pedo.  Im sure Podesta is fine and probably doesnt care too much how conspiracy folks feel,  but he is a human that has to go to bed every night.  The mob mentality to condemn someone with such weak evidence to me in unnerving.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I hear you; but to me it&#39;s been pretty justified by the response. There&#39;s been little attempt to address any of the evidence - and if it&#39;s so weak, this should be easy. </p>

<p>&quot;Fake news&quot; is a post-pizzagate concept. If you&#39;ve been following since the start; you&#39;ll know the response has been to just label it an &#39;absurd conspiracy theory&#39;; without even acknowledging that it&#39;s a serious topic.</p>

<p>Anyway, to each their own opinion. It&#39;s nice to have a civilized convo about it.</p>
