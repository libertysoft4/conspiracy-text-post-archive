        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>On Tuesday I noticed CNN dropped the 24/7 Trump bashing. Actually started covering wikileaks and giving trump fair coverage. NYT has been burying and spinning wikileaks for months, and they started covering it properly. Even Huffington Post released an article on the Pedesta leaks tying the HRC campaign to Saudi money. The madness continues on Wednesday. More pro-trump coverage on CNN. They have changed their tune from skewing polls with a 12 point clinton lead, and now Anderson Cooper is reporting on how the &quot;race is tightening. The timing of this change in reporting seems to coincide with the Project Veritas videos. I feel like the establishment is pulling the plug on the HRC campaign. They either know Trump is positioned for a landslide, or there is bombshell dirt on the way. Thoughts?</p>

<p>Both are very possible. The 2nd one more so than the 1st. Especially since HRC has been backed up by so much corporate money. My personal theory though is that maybe journalists are actually having integrity and are sick of being told what to say/report on.  Like Glenn Greenwald leaving to write for the intercept. Cenk uygur leaving msnbc for the young turks (who are usually good except for right now).  Amber Lyon leaving cnn for...herself.   who knows.</p>

<p>Just out of curiosity, why do you say this? Because before, I couldn&#39;t stand them, like maybe 2 years or so ago, and now I like them. It seems we have an opposite mindset.</p>
