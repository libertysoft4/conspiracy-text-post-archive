        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>The phone call is a fake. Julian Assange wasn&#39;t even on the planning 2 days ago and there were no posters of him participating to the conference before Oct 25. Who pops up on a poster of a conference and gets tweets about is participation just 1 day before the event and only when he is supposed to provide a proof of life?<br/>
 <br/>
Just have a look at <a href="http://archive.is/v1tBD">this archived copy of the Google cache of the event schedule as published on an event marketing site</a> (not the direct website of the organizers). It&#39;s dated Oct. 21 and Julian Assange was not on the program at this time. He&#39;s still not on this program in the non-cached version. Why? because this site is an event marketing site. They are not the direct organizers. They usually get the program a few weeks in advance and market the event. They didn&#39;t change the event schedule when it was abruptly changed on Oct. 25 (1 day before Julian&#39;s phone call) because the organizers forgot to communicate them the changes.<br/>
 <br/>
But the website of the event&#39;s organizers <a href="http://archive.is/hIAYq">was changed on Oct. 25 and was re-saved in google cache at that time</a>. Just when the tweets about Julian&#39;s participation at the event started to appear online. There are <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=assange%20cisl2016&amp;src=typd">no such tweets on Julian participating at that conference with before Oct. 25</a>. Julian Assange is also <a href="http://cisl.org.ar/oradores">not on the official speaker&#39;s list</a> (<a href="http://archive.is/KjjBh">archived version here</a>) of the conference.<br/>
 <br/>
<strong>That&#39;s no coincidence, people. That&#39;s a basic cover-up operation.</strong><br/>
 <br/>
Thus, I believe that this phone intervention was a diversion, like the poll on the Wikileaks Twitter account was a diversion. If you add to that an unprecedented amount of <a href="https://twitter.com/RickyBird11811/status/789577004521656320">tweets drowning Twitter with an embedded 4-year old video of Julian making a speech from the embassy&#39;s balcony</a> to prove he&#39;s fine, or a a flood of <a href="https://twitter.com/ILoveBernie1/status/790547342344777728">tweets with a video of Michael Moore</a> saying he &#39;just got out of the embassy where he spent a few hours with Julian&#39; but which is from June 2016 and which was originally tweeted by the Wikileaks Twitter account, and if one also adds to that the weird tweets from Wikileaks on their account, and also the fact that the people in control of the twitter account didn&#39;t provide any PGP-signed short text to prove they are Wikileaks (which takes 30 seconds to do), <strong>one can only come to the conclusion that all this together is proof that Julian Assange has been either captured or killed.</strong>  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t think Assange&#39;s speech could be synthesized believably. But perhaps this was a speech he gave at a prior event. Or perhaps he gave it under duress. Or it was a sound-a-like speaker who has his speech patterns and inflections down. Or perhaps he really did give that telephone interview. For whatever reason. </p>

</blockquote>

<p>I think that if things truly aren&#39;t as they seem, this is the most likely scenario. Listening to the conference, I thought at first it sounded like his voice could have been synthesized, but the longer I listened, the more convinced I became that it was really him talking and really was contemporaneous. It sounded like he was reiterating the last several days of wikileaks tweets and leaks, adding information, clarification, justification... after listening the whole way through, I heavily doubt that it was faked. </p>

<p>That said, I see no indication that it couldn&#39;t have been done under duress. Make no mistake - his continued effective incarceration <em>is</em> duress, but I mean US/UK-gun-to-his-head, convincingly-participate-in-this-phone-conference-or-else kind of immediate duress.</p>

The only thing I know is that the first event schedules or posters featuring Julian Assange at the CSIL2016 Conference appeared on Oct. 25, only 1 day before he allegedly spoke by phone. That&#39;s insane! No one pop up on on posters 1 day before the event.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I see two common attempts to debunk this. </p>

<ol>
<li><p>&quot;Conferences change all the time, and maybe he got added in at the last minute with some motivation for a need to provide some proof of life.&quot; Sure that could be. But this is the way to do it? Not a phone call to a wikileaks supporting news organization? Not just calling into a wikileaks supporter voicemail to talk about things candidly and why he&#39;s doing what he&#39;s doing? Why was this the venue to provide that proof of life?</p></li>
<li><p>&quot;They cut his internet so of course it was only via phone&quot; Okay, so they cut his internet like 9 days before this conference? Assange was added on the 25th. So they would know for sure that his internet was cut. Why then was everyone at the conference unprepared for no  video, and in fact calling for the tech support to figure out the technical issues behind having no video. IF he was added at the last minute legitimately, the phone call only would be preplanned. </p></li>
</ol>

<p>Editing in my personal agreement with your OP statement that he is dead/alive but under duress</p>

    <div class="md"><p>How do you propose they faked his speech?</p>

<p>(TL;DR: &quot;HE&#39;S OK, FOLKS!&quot;)</p>

<p>To me, his late appearance on the programme is exactly consistent with his sudden need to provide relevant evidence of his safety.</p>

<p>Given his options are currently limited, I believe Julian would have sought this kind of event to give credibility to his proof of life claim.</p>

<p>I would suggest he leveraged this opportunity off his grievances with Ecuador regarding his internet (more on that next), and based on his profile - hence the technological nature of the opportune conference.</p>

<p>Remembering his internet access has been withdrawn, Skype or any other available video telecommunication is, unfortunately, impossible for the moment.</p>

<p>A phone link at an official conference is a pretty good effort in the circumstances, wouldn&#39;t you grant him?</p>

<p>Not to mention his clear and (IMO) deliberate signaling of proof of life, with chronologically current references throughout - including reference to, and elucidation of, the &quot;Stochastic Terminator&quot; tweet.</p>

<p>Perhaps, perhaps, his speech was limited in some way with regard to content. However, he did not seem to be withheld in any way of making explicit mention of the supposed architect of his sanctions, HRC. To me this is conjecture.</p>

<p>In light of all this, and still remembering that Assange without internet may as yet be unaware of all this concern, this amounts to very solid evidence of Assange&#39;s current health and wellbeing.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know if you&#39;re over hyping this deliberately, in line with an undisclosed interest, or if you&#39;re just concerned.</p>

<p>I want to allay your fears and assure you that, although Julian has been &quot;contained&quot;, temporarily, to a degree - he has not been murdered.</p>

<p>You would represent the best of the disinformation agents.  273,876 post karma - 18,133 comment karma...so much patience...feeding the fools you loathe morsels of the &quot;truth&quot; they crave.  &quot;Hey, leave this guy alone.  He is just trying to show people the light.&quot;  So you can feed this shit to them once you have them hooked on your karma.  WOW.  So much karma, he has to be real...right?  </p>

<p>Thanks for pointing mine out.  I create new accounts and burn them all the time!  I have been here since reddits inception.  </p>
