        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>So at around 7pm in London on Saturday I visited the Ecuadorian embassy near the Harrods store and this is what happened: the lights were off except for one window. I got some pictures which I will try to attach soon. I went up to the building and rang the embassy on the intercom. After around a minute of the intercom ringing a gentleman answered speaking broken English. I asked if Mr Assange was in and he told me no. I asked him where he was and he replied that he didn&#39;t know. Then I asked him to ask Mr Assange to come to the window and he started probing me as to who I was and what my name was. I ignored these questions and left. Not much to go by I&#39;m afraid guys but I did try! I&#39;ve seen numerous posts about people asking if anyone from our conspiracy community has visited the embassy so I thought it best to update you all. I did post my experience in a previous post but I&#39;m not sure how many of you saw it. FYI there were NO police outside at the time I went, only a couple of tourists.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Inevitably if he can look out of a window, others can see in. Consequently the windows are under tight
control. At night, Mr. Assange reports that with care he can see out without being observed if
internal lights are switched off, but the constant police presence, visible from every angle has been a
reminder that he is effectively under siege by the UK authorities. After the UK government
announced in October 2015 that the uniformed police had been replaced with a “strengthened covert
operation”, Mr. Assange said “the covert operation is at times covert in name only. They
conspicuously photograph my visitors and the windows of the Embassy all day and even park in the
same places as before”.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Not sure if <em>uniformed</em> police presence is to be expected outside the EC Embassy currently.</p>

<p>The next paragraph is interesting too:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>There were and are enormous pressures being exerted upon the Embassy, the physical infrastructure of
the premises (which are a conversion of a central London flat), and the staff.
All the interviewees alluded to a shift which has taken place over time. Initially, the view was that Mr
Assange needed the protection which the Embassy could provide; this appeared to alter - to the
Embassy needing protection from the situation surrounding him. Individuals who showed him
compassion were affected. They were afraid of coming and going from the Embassy and being
approached by the UK security services.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>OP, we greatly appreciate your efforts.</p>

<p>Try to be careful, btw. Simply by visiting the embassy, you have likely triggered a government investigation into who yourself. They will want to know who you are, what you do, etc. Someone at the government has your name, and they might even know that you posted this to Reddit.</p>

<p>It is unlikely though, that they will try to take action against you, since there was no &quot;harm&quot; done.</p>

<p>Still though, keep these things in mind. And please, be safe.</p>

Basically I come on here every day because it&#39;s full of people who think the same as me and I like to see what is going on in the world but can&#39;t stand the lying media outlets. However, I&#39;m more of a listener than a speaker so that&#39;s why I rarely comment and have never made a post until this one but in this particular situation I thought I could add a little bit to the situation. </p>
