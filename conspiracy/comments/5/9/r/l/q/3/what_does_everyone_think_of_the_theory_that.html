    <div class="md"><p>We can&#39;t speculate on the financial distribution between the two. There is not evidence on that exact nature ( who got paid and what the money was for) . But of what there is evidence ( their closely <a href="http://www.infiniteunknown.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Donald-Trump-Hillary-Clinton.jpg">knit past </a>  and financial ties) we need to be asking questions.</p>

<p>Why would trump and his entire family donate to the Clinton foundation less then ten years ago? Over a half million altogether <a href="http://www.politifact.com/punditfact/statements/2016/aug/28/david-plouffe/yes-donald-trump-donated-100000-clinton-foundation/">source</a> </p>

<p>Why has trump turned so against Hillary after clearly supporting her over any other candidate in 2007?<a href="http://youtu.be/Q76rxpKm3m4">source</a> </p>

<p>How did the Clinton administration plan on using trump in 1999 ?   <a href="http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2016/04/12/fresh-document-trove-sheds-light-on-clinton-trump-ties.html">source</a> </p>

<p>What I would like a trump supporter to answer me is when did Donald trump start not supporting the Clinton&#39;s. When was that tie severed?</p>

<p>Because I can&#39;t find a legitimate time frame where Donald was no longer supporting Clinton. Consider this article from last year where trump was called by Clinton two weeks before he ran  - <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/bill-clinton-called-donald-trump-ahead-of-republicans-2016-launch/2015/08/05/e2b30bb8-3ae3-11e5-b3ac-8a79bc44e5e2_story.html">source</a> </p>

 I don&#39;t think you read this point right. The Clinton administration was very interested in trump running third party in 1999-2000 because of his tax stance </p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is what the article says since you don&#39;t have time to take what I say and do your own research</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;The documents released Tuesday also reflect the Clinton White House’s interest in Trump’s flirtation back in 1999 and 2000 with a third-party presidential run.</p>

<p>One internal White House email in early 2000 among staff notes that Trump “has his eye on the big JOB.” Another from November 1999 forwards an Associated Press article detailing then-potential candidate Trump’s proposal for a one-time 14.25 percent tax on the net worth of wealthy Americans.</p>

<p>“We may need guidance on this,” says the subject line in the email.</p>

<p>It was when they stopped holding political office with which to return favors to him in return for donations.</p>

<p>Why would a clinton plant parade Bill&#39;s mistresses, some he admitted to under oath in a court of law to having, before the second debate? why would a plant want to audit the federal reserve and impose congressional term limits?

Trump donated to her multiple times.
He got Clinton into golf clubs he was not normally allowed in. The numerous pictures of them at weddings and parties. Trumps daughter and Chelsea Clinton being best friends. They share an address for a corporate building in  Delaware. And the emails released through foia saying the Clinton administration wanted trump to run third party in 1999 .

Where First Lady clinton and trump stand or where bill and trump play golf. Apparently they still golf a lot, which is what that phone call bill made to trump last year was only about.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.infiniteunknown.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Donald-Trump-Hillary-Clinton.jpg">this</a> </p>

<p>Apparently the government decided to release these 22 pictures. After a FOIA request <a href="http://www.politico.com/story/2016/09/new-photos-bill-clinton-trump-melania-227945">link</a> 
But
Seems like people in the know are going to great lengths to cover this one up </p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;The National Archives, which operates the library and handles records requests, said it located but will not release 59 photos of Hillary Clinton at a fundraiser Donald Trump apparently attended in New York City in August 1994. It&#39;s unclear how many of the images actually show the then-first lady and Trump</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Almost seems like TPTB are covering up their past</p>
