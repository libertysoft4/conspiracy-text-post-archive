<p>I come to you today as a concerned citizen of the United States. I see how widespread the corruption is - our mainstream media is state controlled, our politicians are controlled by their donors, even Reddit, our last bastion of free speech has now been overrun by CTR shills. Assange&#39;s whereabouts and status are unknown at best. Everything we do and say can be seen by our government&#39;s surveillance program. Protesters are being arrested for exposing the desecration of our land and its people. People are literally being killed by our police and being allowed to walk free. We have prisons who are incentivized to keep people in jail. Pharma companies are robbing us blind and they are propped up by the private health insurance companies who also just want our money. I could go on for much longer but my point is this...</p>

<p>For those of us willing to help, what can we do?</p>

<p>Taking in information and verifying authenticity only goes so far. Voting may or may not work because, as we&#39;ve seen from the democratic primary, this can be fixed. There must be something that can be done to try to fix this mess that we have somehow found ourselves in.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not only is there indeed a spiritual dimension to what is going on, but the spiritual is what ultimately ultimately drives the physical.  However, prayer - especially as most humans misunderstand the term - should not necessarily be confused with the spiritual in and of itself.</p>

<p>You said &quot;We should all be praying.&quot; yet I bet you most interpret that statement as meaning getting on their knees and &quot;begging Jesus Christ to <a href="http://www.relatably.com/m/img/meme-happy-crying-face/Happy-Crying-Face-Meme-01.png">do all the work for us!&quot;</a> while we sit idly by and continue to do nothing of ourselves.</p>

<p>That&#39;s a shit kind of &quot;praying&quot; and doesn&#39;t deserve being looked upon as anything really spiritual.</p>

<p>Prayer is critical if you are intelligent enough to realize that it is ultimately really just focused intent designed to channel energy from The Greater Self (which, holographically-speaking, is literally every one of us) upon a particular task.  The intent involved, however, must be commensurate with the needed task, and the needed task in this case requires far more self-responsibility and focus than we have thus far shown as a citizenry.  As such, &quot;prayer&quot; alone - as most of us in this day and age remedially understand the term, will likely not work anywhere near as effectively as actual intelligent action.</p>

<p>Good.  Don’t just pray for it though.  <em>Exert</em> it.  Not saying you don’t exert it, but prayer without doing your part means nothing.</p>

<p>Reminds me of a joke I heard of a man whose house got flooded by torrential rains, and when he found himself desperately clinging to a floating log in his now over-flooded neighborhood and a safety raft full of people came by shouting “Come on!  Get in!  We’ll save you!”, he said “No.  I’ll just stay here.  God will come and save me.”</p>

<p>So he ended up staying there…and drowning.</p>

<p>When he got up to heaven, he was full of tears and asked God “How come you didn’t save me when I waited for you on the log!?”</p>

<p>and God said “I sent a raft full of people for you, <a href="https://cdn.meme.am/images/498x/166088.jpg"><em>motherfucker!!</em></a>  WTF!?”</p>

<p>lol.  Anyway.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeahhhhhhhhh.....no. God is GOOD. God is LOVE. Evil is not part of God. Evil is a reaction to Good, to God. It cannot stand alone or apart, it can only be an inferior mirror. That&#39;s why satanism&#39;s key iconography is an inverted cross; why black magic uses an inverted pentagram. </p>

<p>The reasoning, God is the creator, so he must also have created evil, is deeply mistaken. It thwarts the truth precisely by this breadth of a hair, and thus prepares the ground for the dominion of evil.</p>

<p>Man is created in the image of God. Man is free. Creation proceeds from the &quot;word,&quot; ie from the creative thought, from the - immaterial - idea. Matter itself is the expression of a successful idea of creation, that is, of a good idea, created by God. But the arrangement of matter, the way in which material reality is shaped, can be based on a bad idea, namely, the idea of robbery, lying, injustice, etc. </p>

<p>These ideas, while also creative, are ultimately doomed, as predicted in the prophecies. They can not be successful in the long term, because they are only inversions, only reactions, to the original creative force.</p>

<p>God and good people, who desire and obey the good voice within themselves, do not pursue evil ideas. If they perceive them, they turn away from them inwardly, withdraw all energy from them, don&#39;t give them time and in no case, neither mentally nor physically work to put them into practice.</p>

<p>The devil and evil men, who desire and obey the evil voice within themselves, pursue evil ideas. When they perceive them, they turn towards them inwardly, they invest their energy and their time and will work with all their strength, spiritually, magically, and physically, to put them into practice.</p>

<p>God, however, is not only the Creator, but also the explicit affirmation and expression of good will, that is, God is not even-handed and unbiased, when it comes to the question of what happens with Creation. </p>

<p>That is precisely, why there is a point, where God, the good will, becomes a warrior and defends his creation. The means, which are used for this purpose are guided by necessity, which is created by the devil&#39;s will and spirit of invention. God will in any case use those means, which are necessary, appropriate and successful. And we may be right about there, right about now. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>lol.  You simply don’t understand God.  And you’re not thinking logically.  Here.  I’ll break it down for you.</p>

<p>I’m sure you believe/assume/think that God is “everything”, right?  Of course you do.  After all, if God <em>wasn’t</em> everything, then God essentially wouldn’t be/couldn’t be “all powerful”.  God would essentially be an impotent little gimp that couldn’t really do all that much if God wasn’t in fact all things/everything.</p>

<p>Well…if God is indeed everything - and God most definitely is - then God, like I said, is the good, the bad, the ugly, and everything in between.  Can’t really have it any other way, broseph.</p>

<p>Sooooo.  God is either a “good” god, which would make that god <em>not</em> “all things” and <em>not</em> “all powerful” and would make it (again) an impotent gimp since there most definitely is so much demonstrable suffering that exists…which would pretty much invalidate the very thing that God stands for (i.e. “all powerful”, etc)….or God <em>is</em> indeed all things, and therefore has to necessarily be <em>all things</em> - which includes (again) the good, the bad, and the ugly.</p>

<p>Again, can’t have it both ways, bro.</p>

<p>And sorry.  I typed all this out after simply reading your whole &quot;God is <em>only</em> love&quot; statement and that&#39;s it.  Didn&#39;t read the rest of what you typed.  Just responded with this.  Didn&#39;t have to because my above comments get right to the heart of the point, and if you can&#39;t deal with/address <em>that</em>, then the rest is ultimately just fluff.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s not about whether it holds traction with <em>you</em> or not.  It&#39;s about whether what I said was true or not one way or the other.  And it is.</p>

<p>You can do <a href="http://veganamericanprincess.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/See-no-evil-hear-no-evil-speak-no-evil-monkeys-14750406-1600-1200.jpg">this</a> to 2+2=4 all you want.  It doesn&#39;t make 2+2=4 any less the case.</p>

<p>Again, it&#39;s just logic that&#39;s being used.  Deal with the logic first.  If you can&#39;t get past that, then...well...then there really <em>wouldn&#39;t</em> have been any point in reading whatever it was you posted all along.</p>

<p>You started off with a false statement.  If you can&#39;t get past dealing with that first, then there was really no point in continuing on, and I was right to have stopped.</p>

I would humbly suggest you give it a try, when you feel comfortable, when there&#39;s no one around who you fear might judge you. Just explain in prayer to God why you feel like you do and ask for divine connection. I&#39;ll pray that you get it. Let&#39;s see what happens. </p>

<p>If not, no harm/no foul. Not up to me and you can&#39;t force salvation on people. Just trying to be helpful. Best to you, either way. We&#39;re all on the same side here, big picture, if we want less corruption and more transparency and a reboot of the way the world is run. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Personally, I feel more rational than ever in my life, though I cannot deny that there are others who would dispute me on that front, LOL. </p>

<p>One thing I CAN say is that I&#39;ve become more patient, understanding, considerate, kind, charitable and...well.....GOOD. I used to have a much worse temper, my brain would hone in on your weakness and my tongue would cut to the quick. I have, in my day, literally left women and children in tears, left men stumbling for words or leaving a room while an audience laughed at their dismay. It&#39;s nothing I&#39;m proud of, a life loaded with moments I&#39;d like to take back.</p>

<p>But I can&#39;t take them back. I can only cringe in memory and apologize to those who I can find and will hear me. In many cases, I&#39;ve been able to make amends, but not all. </p>

<p>Sorry. I&#39;m getting off topic. I appreciate your engagement and it&#39;s been gratifying to get this off my chest. I have already prayed for you, &quot;Coffee55,&quot; and my prayer will linger outside time, patiently, perhaps forever (and that&#39;s okay), until you choose (or not) to pray on your own. May God bless your words, should you do so. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>So then don&#39;t be an illogical, irrational person.  Simple.  Stop listening to human religions.
