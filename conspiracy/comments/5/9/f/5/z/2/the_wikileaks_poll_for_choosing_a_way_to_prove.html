    <div class="md"><p>One point to consider is that if Assange has been extraordinarily rendered to a secret US gulag, that&#39;s not something the Clinton campaign would want made public before the election. Because it lays bare a culture of lawlessness by US officials. And since Wikileaks targeted the Clinton campaign with its leaks, she would be tainted by that sense of overt lawlessness by his illegal detention (or extrajudicial execution). </p>

<p>In other words, for her to viably win the election, Clinton needs to present an appearance of lawful propriety. The Wikileaks leaks damaged that sense of legitimacy. For the US government to then kidnap and detain Assange without due process would, by extension, paint her as partially responsible and destroy any sense of plausible respectability. She&#39;d just be another thug, like everyone else involved in the rendition and torture program. </p>

<p>So if Assange is rendered, don&#39;t expect that truth made public until at least after the election. And perhaps it may never be officially commented on at all. He might just &#39;disappear&#39;. Like one of Pinochet&#39;s political opponents, tossed off the side of a helicopter into the open ocean. </p>

<p>Bye bye. Next! </p>

<p>And since Guantanamo and Abu Ghraib, that&#39;s what the United States has become. </p>
