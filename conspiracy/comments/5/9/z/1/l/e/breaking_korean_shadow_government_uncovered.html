        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>In case you haven&#39;t heard there are country-wide protests occurring in South Korea stemming from a classified email link that essentially implicated the whole government as being illegitimate. The President of Korea is being called to resign after everyone found out their government was completely being ran by a third party which used nonprofits to cover up fraud.</p>

<p>This whole story is absolutely insane and is not being covered anywhere, there’s so much involved you have to do some reading.</p>

<p>Here’s a start: <a href="https://archive.is/uB0bN">https://archive.is/uB0bN</a> <a href="https://archive.is/P9Vt1">https://archive.is/P9Vt1</a> <a href="https://archive.is/0TgFj">https://archive.is/0TgFj</a> <a href="https://i.sli.mg/reEzki.jpg">https://i.sli.mg/reEzki.jpg</a> <a href="https://i.sli.mg/ch9LWY.jpg">https://i.sli.mg/ch9LWY.jpg</a></p>

<p>Here are some links regarding the general situation <a href="https://sli.mg/kabkl9">https://sli.mg/kabkl9</a> <a href="https://sli.mg/xmEnkG">https://sli.mg/xmEnkG</a> <a href="https://sli.mg/uLCdkg">https://sli.mg/uLCdkg</a></p>

<p>There are growing rumors online that this situation implicates the Clinton Foundation, Soros, and even Merkle as the puppeteer ran to Germany. The foundation&#39;s being used by Choi Soon-sil and the South Korean President are very similar to what we may see in the coming weeks to Clinton.</p>

<p>THIS IS LITERALLY THE CLINTON FOUNDATION PARALLEL OF KOREA.</p>

<p>And judging by the complete media blackout I wouldn&#39;t be surprised (nothing on r/worldnews even). </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is starting to get some coverage from <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/asia_pacific/south-koreas-presidency-on-the-brink-of-collapse-as-scandal-grows/2016/10/28/7639a2cc-1700-4ef7-a3a4-661b3ff989c4_story.html">mainstream outlets</a>.</p>

<p>From Washington Post:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The essence of the scandal is this: It has emerged that Park, notoriously aloof even to her top aides, has been taking private counsel from Choi Soon-sil, a woman she’s known for four decades. Despite having no official position and no security clearance, Choi seems to have advised Park on everything from her wardrobe to speeches about the dream of reunification with North Korea.</p>

<p>Calls for her resignation — and even impeachment — are resonating from across the political spectrum, and her approval ratings have dropped to a record low of 17 percent, according to two polls released Friday.</p>

<p>On Friday, Park directed all of her top advisers to resign en masse, with her spokesman saying a reshuffle would take place, the Yonhap news agency reported. Kim Jae-won, senior presidential secretary for political affairs, told a parliamentary session that Park’s chief of staff had already stepped down.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And a little bit more about this &quot;mysterious advisor&quot; further down:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Choi is the daughter of the late Choi Tae-min, who was a kind of shaman-fortune teller described in a 2007 cable from the U.S. Embassy in Seoul as “a charismatic pastor.” Locally, he’s seen as a “Korean Rasputin” who once held sway over Park after her mother was assassinated in 1974.</p>

<p>“Rumors are rife that the late pastor had complete control over Park’s body and soul during her formative years and that his children accumulated enormous wealth as a result,” read the cable, released by WikiLeaks.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>TL;DR: Our world leaders are not only corrupt but also batshit insane. More news at 8.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Great, thanks!</p>

<p>Interesting coincidences: About 1989 or 1990, I was given these two books:</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://ldolphin.org/PDFs/The_Two_Babylons-Alexander_Hislop.pdf">The Two Babylons</a></strong> by Alexander Hyslop (written in 1853), and <strong><a href="https://archive.org/details/Babylon-Mystery-Religion-Ralph-Woodrow">Babylon Mystery Religion by Ralph Woodrow</a></strong> (1966) which draws heavily on Hislop&#39;s work).</p>

<p>Later, (perhaps 1992 or 1993) was went to an outdoors/ camping/ sportsman&#39;s show and exhibition, and happened to visit a small booth where a man with a ruddy, rough complexion and a powerful personality was offering books. After talking with him for perhaps 15 minutes I was intrigued, and I bought the book that he had written, and was promoting at the event: <strong><a href="http://www.whale.to/b/cooper.pdf">Behold A Pale Horse</a></strong>. He happily autographed it for me.</p>

<p>I had no idea who this &quot;<strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milton_William_Cooper">Bill Cooper</a></strong>&quot; fellow was at the time, and frankly, I was astonished at many of the claims he made in that book. </p>

<p>I&#39;ve learned a lot since then.</p>

<p>/RIP, Bill</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks for the two books. </p>

<p>Guess i&#39;ll do some reading this Sunday . </p>

<p>Like I keep on saying to everyone willing to hear, Bill Cooper was one of the very few honest men in this whole &quot;conspiracy&quot; thing. Him and Phil Schneider. </p>

<p>It seems a bit surreal to me to talk to someone who&#39;s actually met my hero. He died when I was in high school and a few years before I started reading into this. I hope you still have that book. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>So have I - for decades. Every time I think I&#39;m starting to get it figured out, the plot thickens. The Rabbit Hole is a fucking labyrinth.</p>

<p>Are you religious? I&#39;m not - but in any case, might I recommend reading the first two 
books of the Bible - Genesis and Exodus? </p>

<p>Great starting point, because what IS there is very different  from what most people THINK is there - and these books have had a profound influence in shaping modern society.</p>

<p>Difficulty: You&#39;ll have to read them with an open mind - like they are a simple story - carefully following the PLOT. This will be especially difficult if you ARE religious, as you&#39;ll have to overcome the preconceptions that have been inculcated into your psyche since you were a child.</p>

<p>Also, <strong><a href="http://remnantradio.org/Archives/articles/William%20Cooper/Mystery%20Babylon/MB1.htm">see the link</a></strong> provided by <a href="/u/alexdrac">/u/alexdrac</a>, and those I posted elsewhere in this thread - but filter any religious preconceptions that the authors/speakers may show, and try to follow the PLOT.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is way, way beyond that. </p>

<p>A cable released by wikileaks from 2007 says that this woman controls &quot;the body and soul&quot; of the current president. For a diplomat to use such language, you know something&#39;s out of the ordinary. </p>

<p>Also this isn&#39;t some ordinary power-control scheme. It&#39;s a cult. A weird, weird cult that claims it&#39;s a &quot;buddhist-shamanistic-christian&quot; . </p>

<p>The father of the woman controlling the president took her under his wing after her father (the former dictator of SK) was assassinated in 1979 by claiming he could channel the spirit of her mother (assassinated in 1974). He was the creator of the cult in question. </p>

<p>Anyway, check out the thread on <a href="/r/worldnews">/r/worldnews</a> about it. There&#39;s a lot of Koreans there giving explanations. This is truly an insane situation. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have the opposite opinion on that.</p>

<p>There should definitely be advisors that are level headed, well spoken, and proficient of the matters they&#39;re given oversight of; being generally knowledgeable is a great plus as well. To add, they should definitely have their own agenda, separate from general politics, transparency is a plus. </p>

<p>As far as I can tell so far, this is not how Korea works, the advisors were the one pulling the strings from the get go. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Interesting read, both links, but not much I didn&#39;t already know/assume, sans some of the wiki references. I don&#39;t change my statement though. Having advisors that are knowledgeable is a great thing, as well as having personal agendas, character and transparency are key. </p>

<p>A core purpose of a government, which I&#39;m open to reconsider, is to lead people. Towards ideologies, towards a future. Simplistically, let&#39;s make a scenario: if I were in a point in time where humans were nearing the end of an alpha male dominance hierarchy, and the rise in capability of thought, philosophy, introspection, and not past the need for survival, the best way to progress towards any future would be to get others to think similarly towards a common goal; survival. It&#39;d be similar to the alpha hierarchy in that the leaders would still be physically capable and the others would follow suit, for survival purposes, but now things have meaning, be it that our leader&#39;s life is more important than ours, or that all life is sacred, or other notions. We&#39;re living in groups bigger than just family and the leader&#39;s thoughts are ours as well, his ideas are ours to follow, for survival. Not everyone agrees, and a gradual or abrupt power struggle ensues, and ideologies of the rest of the village/ population change. Transition from point before to this point would&#39;ve been gradual (and the transition to our current time is very long as well). It&#39;s the same concept today only we&#39;re more evolved and we&#39;re many more than we were before, is not easy to control/ lead a lot of people at once (media helps, but is also harmful).</p>

<p>Influence is a hell of a drug for a society... I know what sub I&#39;m in,  I love conspiracies, but even in the current transition towards a NWO (hang me now, because I actually support this (I used to be against it with a poison)), I feel that the only real way to make any progress is to get out there and influence others, but don&#39;t just say stuff and accuse others, offer a solution or ask for some and help better society. We&#39;re all individuals but we&#39;re also a collective and have to deal with each other.</p>

<p>Complacency, personal gain, and control are advocates and double edged swords for governments. It&#39;s sometimes in a government&#39;s best interest for you not to know things, for example, that life as you know can be different. Education does a great job at what it does to control, but it also opens doors to progress, it&#39;s not a bad thing at is core. To add to government interests, it&#39;s  structure could fall apart if enough people felt this way and did something about it, and that&#39;s no good, &quot;I&#39;ve spent way too much time creating this system and I benefit too much from it for you guys to tear it down. I have to get rid of this/these individuals.&quot; In a sense this is why the prison system exists... to stop individuals from going against the government. We sometimes get too complacent with how much we benefit that we create barriers for progress in certain fields (groups or corporations), I&#39;m not saying  all barriers are bad though. </p>

<p>Part of the human experience is to try different forms of government to try and progress, aside from a hive mind of sorts or a centralized collective in which all our thoughts are processed (think a giant brain), i don&#39;t think we&#39;re quite where we could be (and even then, I feel that&#39;s just a beginning).</p>

<p>Realistically in current time, a democratic republic, is a better form of government, but it has many shortcomings as well. </p>

<p>A final note,  governments are no more than a collective of people with different ideals pushing towards different and common interests. It&#39;s very hard to keep things under control. Systems, facilities, and ideals/thoughts can be and are put in place to prevent or placate groups or individuals (for uprisings or otherwise)  but they also serve other purposes, individually as well as together, you just have to look for the good in things.  The subject of money, laws and economy is a different entity that ties in, but in short I feel they&#39;re generally good for our current society (they could use a lot of work though). I don&#39;t think there&#39;s any real need to worry about a nuclear outbreak between powers (governments),  though we&#39;re very emotional and irrational beings, I could be wrong...a lot depends on the individual, you.</p>

<p>Take my thoughts as you will, I&#39;ve  rambled for long enough, I&#39;m not even sure if any of this makes sense together, I&#39;ll reread after I sleep... There&#39;s still alot for me to learn on the history of man. I&#39;ve provided no references, so don&#39;t take it as truths, but please consider them.</p>

<p>I can&#39;t find any kind of reliable sourcing on a few things.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>What were the leaks? who were they from? what did they contain? No mention this in western media whatsoever. Actually,  the omission of these basic journalistic facts makes me think this might actually be true.</p></li>
<li><p>What&#39;s the deal with the Soros links? Can someone fill me in there? Again, heard the claim, but no argument. This seems a stretch to me, but possible.</p></li>
<li><p>What&#39;s the deal with the foundations? Are they similar to the Clinton Foundations? how so? I definitely can see tptb / hillary believing that the &quot;Foundation&quot; style of government is the future of governing. That is to say, running the government like a hedge fund, returning profit and resources to investors. But again, there are just not enough links here.</p></li>

The geology of the area is highly volcanic and earthquake prone, it perfectly fits the description from Plato, and explains the sea peoples/Bronze Age collapse. Also check out the Azores flag after you reference Atlantis symbology. Granted, they might be doing that for tourism, but it&#39;s like a big flashing sign if you know the symbology.</p>

<p>It&#39;s midnight or later in the States, heading into the weekend. You won&#39;t find anyone covering shit. That said, I&#39;ve seen three rising articles on the world news sub. One of the articles came from ABC News and one of the articles you&#39;ve already linked to. I had to make sure I wasn&#39;t in this sub when I read the headline on the ABC article. Give it time. If more hasn&#39;t come out by Monday then you can start to say there&#39;s a media black out. </p>

<p>Founded on May 17, 1982 by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unification_Church">Unification Church</a> leader Sun Myung Moon, the Times was owned by News World Communications, an international media conglomerate associated with the church until 2010, in which Moon and a group of former executives purchased the paper. It is currently owned by diversified conglomerate Operations Holdings, which is a wholly owned subsidiary of the Church.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun_Myung_Moon">Sun Myung Moon</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>was a Korean religious leader, businessman, and political activist. A messiah claimant, he was the founder of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unification_Church">Unification Church</a> (members of which called him their True Father, and have themselves sometimes been called &quot;Moonies&quot;), and of its widely noted &quot;Blessing&quot; or mass wedding ceremony, and the author of its unique theology the Divine Principle. He was an ardent anti-communist and advocate for Korean reunification, for which he was recognized by the governments of both South and North Korea. His business interests included <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/News_World_Communications">News World Communications</a>, an international news media corporation known for its American subsidiary The Washington Times, and Tongil Group, a South Korean business group (chaebol), as well as various affiliated organizations.</p>

<p>Moon was born in what is now North Korea. When he was a child, his family converted to Christianity. In 1947 he was convicted by the North Korean government of spying for South Korea and given a five-year sentence to the Hŭngnam labor camp. In 1954, he founded the Unification Church in Seoul, South Korea based on conservative, family-oriented teachings from new interpretations of the Bible. In 1971, he moved to the United States and became well-known after giving a series of public speeches on his beliefs. In the 1982 case United States v. Sun Myung Moon he was found guilty of willfully filing false federal income tax returns and sentenced to 18 months in federal prison. His case generated protests from clergy and civil libertarians.</p>

<p>Critics labeled Moon a cult leader, who made high demands on his followers. His wedding ceremonies also drew criticism, especially after they involved members of other churches, including Roman Catholic archbishop Emmanuel Milingo. He was also criticized for his relationships with political and religious figures, including Presidents of the United States Richard Nixon, George H. W. Bush and George W. Bush, Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev, North Korean President Kim Il Sung, and Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan</p>

<p><a href="http://bit.ly/2dYdqaV">National Intelligence Service of South Korea</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>The agency&#39;s origins can be traced back to the Korean Counterintelligence Corps (KCIC), formed during the Korean War. The KCIA was founded on June 13, 1961 by Kim Jong-pil, who drew much of the organization&#39;s initial 3,000-strong membership from the KCIC. Kim, a Korean Military Academy graduate and nephew of Park Chung-hee by marriage, is also credited for masterminding the 1961 coup d&#39;etat that installed Park before he was elected president of Korea.</p>

<p>The KCIA is known to have raised funds through extortion and stock market manipulation, which were in turn used to bribe and cajole companies, individuals, and even foreign governments, as did happen during the Koreagate scandal on Capitol Hill in 1976. Domestically, the KCIA made itself the philanthropical arm of the government by being an avid supporter of the arts, promoter of tourism, and purveyor of national culture. Investigations by Congressman Donald M. Fraser found the KCIA to have funneled bribes and favors through Korean businessman Tongsun Park in an attempt to gain favor and influence in Washington, D.C.; some 115 Members of Congress were implicated in what became known as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Koreagate">Koreagate scandal</a>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Koreagate">1976 KoreaGate Scandal</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Such financial incentives reportedly ranged from US$100,000 to $200,000 at a time per individual. Some 115 members of Congress were supposedly involved. Speculation also focused on the role of Unification Church founder Sun Myung Moon, former KCIA Director Kim Hyung Wook, and former South Korean Prime Minister Chung Il Kwon</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Craig_J._Spence">Craig Spence</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Spence&#39;s name came to national prominence in the aftermath of a June 28, 1989 article in the Washington Times identifying Spence as a customer of a homosexual escort service being investigated by the Secret Service, the District of Columbia Police and the United States Attorney&#39;s Office for suspected credit card fraud. The newspaper said he spent as much as $20,000 a month on the service. He had also been linked to a White House guard who has said he accepted an expensive watch from Mr. Spence and allowed him and friends to take late-night White House tours.</p>

<p>Spence entered a downward spiral in the wake of the Washington Times exposé, increasingly involving himself with call boys and crack, and culminating in his <strong>July 31, 1989</strong> arrest at the Barbizon Hotel on East 63rd St in Manhattan for criminal possession of a firearm and criminal possession of cocaine.</p>

<p>Months after the scandal had died down, and a few weeks before Spence was found in a room of the Boston Ritz-Carlton Hotel, he was asked who had given him the &quot;key&quot; to the White House. Michael Hedges and Jerry Seper of The Washington Times reported that &quot;Mr. Spence hinted the tours were arranged by &#39;top level&#39; persons&quot;, including <strong>Donald Gregg</strong>, national security adviser to Vice President George H. W. Bush at the time the tours were given.</p>

<p>When pressed to identify who it was who got him inside the White House, Spence asked &quot;Who was it who got [long-term CIA operative] Félix Rodríguez in to see Bush?&quot;, agreeing that he was alluding to Mr. Gregg.</p>

<p>Gregg himself dismissed the allegation as &quot;absolute bull&quot;, according to Hedges and Seper. &quot;It disturbs me that he can reach a slimy hand out of the sewer to grab me by the ankle like this,&quot; he told the reporters. &quot;The allegations are totally false.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Gregg">Donald Phinney Gregg</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>is a retired American politician, CIA employee, and <strong>U.S. Ambassador to South Korea</strong>. Gregg worked for the <strong>Central Intelligence Agency for 31 years, from 1951 to 1982</strong>. He was a National Security Council advisor (1979–1982) and National Security Advisor to U.S. Vice President George H. W. Bush (1982–1989), <strong>United States Ambassador to Korea (1989–1993)</strong>, and the chairman of the board of The Korea Society (until 2009), where he called for greater engagement with North Korea.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>i had to brush up my korean for this one but i spent a few hours reading up on this on naver.com (korean google) and here jt goes.</p>

<p>current SK president (PGH) s the daughter of a former dictator (well respected tho, brought country out of shithole)</p>

<p>PGH&#39;s mother passes and PGH is approached by a some nut cult leader named tae min choi (TMC)</p>

<p>TMC and PGH had inappropriate sexual relationship? idk this shit is unraveling as we speak</p>

<p>PGH is a cult religious leader and his daughter from fifth wife (also bff with PGH) is his successor.</p>

<p>over their 40 year relationship? park geun hye is completly fucking brainwashed by choi soon shil (CSS) </p>

<p>PGH shared some classified documents with CSS and from what im reading CSS did pull shitload of strings for her non profit profit maximization but PGH did seek her advice on various matters and CSS advised her based on &quot;religious signs&quot; idk some complete bogus shit.</p>

<p>all this stemmed from a scandal that originated from a fake diploma from a prestige womens college in korea. CSS is belived to be filthy rich and currently residing in &quot;germany&quot;  but many korean netizens are trying to prove otherwise.</p>

<p>i asked my parents about this because there were some words i couldnt comprehend fully and their response is fucking gold. i didnt misunderstood anything and this is whats happening</p>

<p>yes people, this shit is actually fucking happening in korea.</p>

<p>a puppet government ran by some religious nut jobs. </p>

<p>the best part of all, presidnet PGH came out and apologized for it, no disputes no explations nothing. like what the actual fuck</p>

    <div class="md"><p>We are being attacked by a plethora of different methods, identity politics being just one of them. </p>

<p>The whole shabang about how islamists are great people is another. (notice how i said islamist, as in person who believes islam should be the law of the land where they live, not muslim; about half of mulsims world-wide are also islamists, this is not a small sub-sect, but the distinction has to be made every time)</p>

<p>BLM and the whole race-baiting scenario is another - that&#39;s failing too, Trump will get more black votes then any other Republican since Eisenhower most likely. </p>

<p>If you want to and have the time, <a href="http://remnantradio.org/Archives/articles/William%20Cooper/Mystery%20Babylon/MB1.htm">here is the man that puts all these things together</a>, he connects all the seemingly separate parts of the New World Order&#39;s plan and shows how it&#39;s all part of the same strategy with the same end-game. </p>

<p>This is the man that said on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CEsesnzDBvA">June 28th 2001</a> that there will soon be a great terrorist attack on the US that will be blamed on Osama bin Laden . And it will all be a goddamn show. </p>

<p>If you&#39;re interested in this whole thing , like really interested, not just in a &quot;conspiracies are cool&quot; way, take your time and listen to the series on Mystery Babylon. It&#39;s a 40+ part series. But he backs up each and every statement he makes with quotes from the people planning this shit themselves. You see , in the 18th, 19th and early 20th century (before WW1) they were not hiding their plans at all, since no one thought they&#39;d ever come to fruition - &quot;plans for 150-200 years in the future, that&#39;s crazy&quot;. So they printed their thoughts and intentions for their inner circles in books that were available to the public too, though in limited number. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>No problem man. Someone, years and years ago, helped me out and pointed me to Bill Cooper. So I try and nudge others to look into him. </p>

<p>He&#39;s the only man who lived by his word about fighting for us and against the evil empire. When he started, he used to speak to audiences of 10-15 pensioners and had to travel thousands of miles to do it. He was a kind, loving man who never wanted to get involved into any of this. But he couldn&#39;t just let it all happen and not do anything about it. </p>

<p>Take your time with the Mystery Babylon series. It will really, really blow your mind. Everything&#39;s so clearly connected, all those suspicions you might have had along the years that <em>this</em> has to be part of a bigger picture, that <em>this event</em> doesn&#39;t feel right. Well, there&#39;s the explanation for it all. </p>

    <p class="byline text-muted mb-0"><a href="javascript:;" class="score"><span class="badge badge-secondary">3</span></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a class="author" href="../../../../../../../../user/40kfreak.html">40kfreak</a> 2016-10-29</p>
    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m pretty hungover but I&#39;ll see what I can do here:</p>

<p>Firstly, reunification is an incredibly complicated issue, particularly in the disparity between development in both countries. Something close would be the reunification of east and west germany and there are <em>still</em> problems getting one of the premier warsaw-pact countries in terms of economic development up to the west German standard. Saying that Japan and the US don&#39;t want reunification cuts out the fact that reunification would be a <em>nightmare</em> for South Korea as they try to administer over the mess that a collapsed north would be. </p>

<p>As for weapons, Japan and SK are both US-aligned and very important to historic and modern US goals. The Pacific is a very important source of trade for the US, and enforcing a rules-based system of free trade with friendly nations is very much in the US&#39; interests. This means that Japan and South Korea had a lot of leverage when it came to procuring weapons. They used their position to negotiate very favorable offset deals to their industry and slowly built up their ability to build licensed versions and then their own weapons entirely. Obviously the US still sells to them, particularly aircraft, but they are increasingly self-sufficient in the weapons department and not the massive, all-encompassing source of profit for the US arms industry. </p>

<p>These two point tie together with China. North Korea is not the big scary country here, China is. North Korea is certainly a threat, but a resurgent China is what threatens the regional balance as far as most east asian countries are concerned. China doesn&#39;t like the degree of control the US has over the seas, hypothetically the US could do tremendous economic damage by blockading China. This means the Chinese have been more and more aggressive in securing its economic interests through claiming territory, building islands, building big scary anti-ship missiles, and generally attempting to muscle in on the system without triggering a war outright. SK and Japan might not like each other, but neither is particularly worried about war between them, particularly with the US there to moderate. </p>

<p>As for the nuke bit, that&#39;s ridiculous. South Korea and Japan could build nuclear weapons within 2 years they just don&#39;t feel the need to, especially against each other. What <em>might</em> happen as China continues to grow is a Pacific arms race, but that&#39;s not necessarily going to happen or be nuclear if it does happen, particularly as the other nuclear powers are extremely interested in no one new getting nukes. </p>

<p>As for the <em>insane geopolitics</em> predicted, some things here are screwy logically. Australia is going to Nuke up but not Taiwan? and Korea and Japan are going to threaten each other not seek to protect itself from China? Other powers such as the US and Russia are just going to stand around and let this happen? </p>

<p>All-in-all I think this person doesn&#39;t really understand what&#39;s going on, how countries are interacting with each other, and just wants to be a doomsday prophet. </p>

    <div class="md"><p><strong>Sounds like what is happening in the US. Watch <a href="http://documentary-movie.com/inside-job/">Inside Job</a> and wake up to the endless control of government by the financial sector!</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Inside Job demonstrates how the American financial sector brought the country to the brink through reckless risk taking, complex financial structures, and sheer greed. Banks provided mortgages to people who were unable to afford them in order to earn greater fees. Through financial engineering, these ‘toxic’ mortgages were then sliced, diced and bundled up into fancy packages and sold off to outside investors, who later lost out when house prices declined and borrowers defaulted. The repercussions were severe and spread throughout the economy. People lost their homes and investors and pension funds suffered heavy losses. The information you learn in this film will inspire both anger and outrage.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Chans in general are great for getting news out. Every post bumps a thread to the top giving it lots of exposure. There usually isn&#39;t a way to sort news other then a search bar so its a lot harder to bury a story, as users have no choice but to see it. Think about all the excellent posts here that get buried unless you regularly sort by new. The huge user base of 4chan spreads the news to other sites as well. That&#39;s why gaming companies shill on /v/.</p>
