        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>The Clinton Narrative Network really doesn&#39;t like when their wanna-be-reality doesn&#39;t stick to, well, the true reality.<br/>
 <br/>
Not so long ago in July, when The FBI Director announced that he wouldn&#39;t recommend criminal charges against Clinton, <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2016/07/05/opinions/fbi-clinton-decision-gergen/">CNN lauded Comey for all his great work</a> and stated the following:  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>So far as we can now tell, the country in this instance has been well served by a leader and an FBI that has been diligent, hard-working and fair. Embittered partisans will disagree, but for my book, the FBI seems to have gotten this one right.  </p>
</blockquote>

<p> <br/>
But today, it seems that <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2016/10/28/opinions/fbi-director-comey-should-resign-opinion-callan/index.html">CNN changed quite its mind on Comey&#39;s qualifications and just asked for his resignation</a>:  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Perhaps it&#39;s time for the embattled FBI director who seems to have forgotten how to conduct a proper investigation to resign.   </p>
</blockquote>

<p> <br/>
I love &quot;unbiased&quot; news networks like CNN. I am sure they contribute so much to the &quot;great trust&quot; people have in the MSM...  </p>

</blockquote>

<p>No they didn&#39;t. They knew about the break-in, but evidence implicating the involvement of Nixon and other high officials didn&#39;t become widely known until after the election.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The affair began with the arrest of five men for breaking and entering into the DNC headquarters at the Watergate complex on Saturday, June 17, 1972. The FBI investigated and discovered a connection between cash found on the burglars and a slush fund used by the Committee for the Re-Election of the President (CRP), the official organization of Nixon&#39;s campaign.[4][5] <strong>In July 1973, evidence mounted against the President&#39;s staff</strong>, including testimony provided by former staff members in an investigation conducted by the Senate Watergate Committee. The investigation revealed that President Nixon had a tape-recording system in his offices and that he had recorded many conversations.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Back in those days, news sources were very limited. Not anymore. Hillary&#39;s corruption has been laid bare for all to see.</p>

<p>It&#39;s like when you hold back your true thoughts about someone until it builds up and you holler the truth at them. Things can&#39;t just go back to the way they were.</p>
