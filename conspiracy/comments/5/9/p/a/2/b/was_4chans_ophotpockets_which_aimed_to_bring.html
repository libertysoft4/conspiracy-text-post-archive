<p>Someone posted a map showing Tweets made around the Embassy:</p>

<p>Assange supposedly did a conference call live on air yesterday. The conference was never announced by Wikileaks, and the proof of life poll, asking for a video, was never actually satisfied by their Twitter. A live stream with audio only and his picture is not a video, and this conference was never announced before/during/afterwards by their Twitter, never used or suggested as proof of life. Nobody close to Assange, including Wikileaks staff, have mentioned this conference.</p>

<p>Some options:</p>

<ul>
<li>Assange did a real, unimpeded conference call from the embassy, or was given the conference questions before hand and pre-recorded his answers knowing his situation at the Embassy is critical and could fold at any moment, live on air even. He&#39;s still holed up at the Embassy, petting cats, writing recipes, and having casual meetups with Baywatch stars. We heard he was tortured...by a vegan sandwich. You&#39;d think he stays in contact with the outside world using a &quot;conference call&quot; though, especially after his internet was cut to give an official update or something, right?</li>
<li>The Embassy was raided, we saw the pictures of police vehicles. Fox News reported he would be arrested in a few hours, that was on Oct 18th. They took Assange for the rape allegations or CIA rendition 9 miles away from the Embassy to a nearby airport, which coincidentally underwent a chemical attack clearing out witnesses and distracting low level airport personnel. John Kerry and Goldman Sachs may have struck a deal to bring him down any way possible. The conference was somehow forced or faked, using voice technology, or it was done under the presence and duress of multiple intelligence agents with their fingers on the mute button. Assange&#39;s whereabouts unknown.</li>
</ul>

<p>Where is Assange? In the aftermath that unfolded yesterday, this is for anyone still interested.</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE</strong></p>

<p>This story just broke. It refers to his teleconference and makes it look like Assange is back in the public eye, <em>but the image depicting him on the Embassy balcony is from August or older.</em></p>

<p>THIS THREAD IS BEING DOWN VOTED SHARPLY WHY?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Wikileaks Twitter mentioned a contingency plan being put in place, and a Stochastic Terminator &quot;algorit<strong>him</strong>&quot; being &quot;updated&quot;. Were these automated contingency plan Tweets? Does any of this relate to the &quot;dead man&#39;s switch&quot;? Maybe &quot;Stochastic Terminator&quot; is another phrase for &quot;Dead Man Switch&quot;. What could this all mean? Numerous mysteries still linger.</p>

<p>What is a precommitment?</p>

<p>Precommitment is a strategy in which a party to a conflict uses a commitment device to strengthen its position by cutting off some of its options to make its threats more credible.</p>

<p>A couple ideas so far:</p>

<ul>
<li>Project Runway could refer to a controversial project in Okinawa where airplane runways are being built. Okinawa is close to China and as you know there are tensions at sea between U.S. and China. Here is a document <a href="http://www.fas.org/sgp/crs/row/R42645.pdf">The U.S. Military Presence in Okinawa and the Futenma Base Controversy</a></li>
<li>7FG final request probably refers to 7th Floor Group (aka &quot;shadow government&quot;), as mentioned by another Reddit user. Not really sure where this leads though.</li>
</ul>

<p>Also this mystery:</p>

<p>A theory about the conference call:</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Let&#39;s rewind a bit and understand how Wikileaks works.</p>

<p>Assange has stated that he has multiple servers in data centers across Europe publishing the information on autopilot. This sounds to me like he has many redundant servers with different hosts so if one is taken down the rest continue to operate. Submissions are done automatically with CRON jobs or something. In order to take Wikileaks down they would have to get ALL of these servers, or use a blanket attack like a DDOS (which did happen).</p>

<p>Which brings us to the Stochastic Terminator algorithm being &quot;updated&quot;. If this should refer to the algorithm that drops leaks on autopilot, then wouldn&#39;t he have to update every damn one of those servers across Europe with the algorithm?</p>

<p>It makes more sense (to me) that the Stochastic Terminator algorithm is actually the Dead Man Switch, and the &quot;update&quot; that was Tweeted basically means, <em>Dead Man Switch has been activated</em> resulting in specific material (contingency) now coming down the pipeline instead of just leaks.</p>

<p>The pre-commitments (John Kerry, Ecuador, UK FCO) are, as most people have described, hashes that prove a file hasn&#39;t been modified since the time it was created. Usually these are followed by leaked document downloads so people can get the files and verify they are authentic (without even opening the docs, since they are still encrypted). But whatever the files are, they haven&#39;t been released. These hashes are like Assange&#39;s trump card. What I think may be happening here is that he is about to be tortured to make a confession for pedophilia, but the hashes on these files will eventually exonerate him at a later date and prove the confessions he made were under duress. If we align this theory with the fact that Fox News reported an arrest was going to be made on Oct 18th, and Pam Anderson visited him on Oct 16th where he said she &quot;tortured him&quot;, it all fits. Very powerful political entities have been pulling strings to silence Assange any way possible, including that CIA front company Todd &amp; Clare, we cannot forget how many cards are stacked against him. It&#39;s a wild theory, but I can&#39;t think of anything more obvious.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Someone who knows how to program algorithms and how to automate publishing of highly sensitive leaks to websites without being quickly shut down, cannot afford to make spelling mistakes. Programming requires ZERO spelling mistakes. Someone else has taken over Twitter, or there is a secret message.</p>

<p>Surely typing a misspelled word into Twitter would have underlined it and suggested a spelling fix?</p>

<p>Don&#39;t want to waste all your time either, but I&#39;m hoping you can give this thread a quick scroll. Mysteries abound, people close to Wikileaks are dead, still no mention by his team about the recent conference, and 12 days until we hit the wall on a new POTUS.</p>

<p>(many votes have already been placed early with absentee ballots etc)</p>

<p>In this final stretch, here is what Wikileaks and Assange have given the public:</p>

<ul>
<li>Podesta email leaks on autopilot</li>
<li>An audio only teleconference unrelated to Wikileaks and (still) unacknowledged by Wikileaks</li>
</ul>

<p>Is Assange ducking out to build impact for one big final drop? Is he completely AWOL? Or is he simply going about his own business as usual, not giving a rats ass about what Reddit/Twitter users think?</p>
