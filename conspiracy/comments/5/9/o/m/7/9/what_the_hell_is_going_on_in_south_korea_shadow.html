<blockquote>
<p>It is truly frightening that this confidante, with no official position in the government and apparently without any qualifications that could have given her the sort of power she apparently wielded, was allowed to continue uninterrupted.
The administration did not hesitate to pressure Culture Ministry officials to do its bidding, going so far as to remove officials who refused to toe its line.
Culture Minister Yoo Jin Ryong was fired in July 2014 after clashing with Park. A Culture Ministry official who wrote a report that was not to Park&#39;s liking was demoted and then finally asked to leave. The National Museum head was allegedly removed for refusing to host an exhibition that Park wanted to see.
The Mir Foundation was launched in October 2015 and K-Sports Foundation in January this year. Yoo pointed to then-Chief of Staff Kim Ki Choon as having ordered the resignations. Yoo further alleged the Blue House screened Culture Ministry officials&#39; &quot;ideological orientations&quot; to arrive at the list of the six officials to be sacked.
It is under this administration that a &quot;blacklist&quot; of nearly 10,000 cultural figures &quot;classified&quot; as being critical of the government has surfaced, despite Culture Minister Cho Yoon Sun&#39;s disavowal of the existence of such a list.
The president seemingly allowed her confidante to exercise power unchecked, especially in the cultural sector. It is suspected that Choi and her closest associates exploited culture-related events and organizations for personal gain. The lofty goal of cultural enrichment, it appears, was appropriated by the president&#39;s confidante and her cronies who sucked the marrow out of culture to fatten their bellies. It will be a long path to resuscitating culture and rehabilitating it back to health.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Former Mir Foundation official says power broker Choi received detailed presidential report almost daily, and led meetings on governance
Behind-the-scenes power broker Choi Sun-sil received and reviewed 30 cm-thick “Presidential report packets” from the Blue House on a nearly daily basis until as recently as this spring, a witness recently claimed.
Choi is also reported to have used the materials to hold behind-the-scenes meetings to discuss all aspects of governance. 
“Appointment issues were also discussed at the meetings, and decisions were made on who to make or not make a Cabinet minister,” he added.
“It’s a real break with common perceptions to say this, but it’s actually a system where Choi tells the President to do things this way or that way. &gt;There aren’t any issues where the President can decide on her own,” Lee said. “It’s basically only possible once Choi has been asked about and approves everything. Even the Blue House ‘door knocker triumvirate’ are basically all just Choi’s messengers.”</p>
