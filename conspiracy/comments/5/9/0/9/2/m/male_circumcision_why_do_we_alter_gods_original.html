    <div class="md"><p>There <em>is</em> evidence that suggests circumcision can prevent HIV. </p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circumcision_and_HIV">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circumcision_and_HIV</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Evidence supports that male circumcision prevents HIV infection in men who have sex with women.[1][2] In 2011, the WHO and the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) stated that male circumcision could be an efficacious intervention for HIV prevention if carried out by well trained medical professionals and under clean conditions.[3][4][5] The United States Disease Control Center states that circumcision reduces the risk that a man will acquire HIV and other STIs from an infected female partner. [6]</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Also from the <a href="http://www.who.int/hiv/topics/malecircumcision/en/">WHO</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>There is compelling evidence that male circumcision reduces the risk of heterosexually acquired HIV infection in men by approximately 60%. Three randomized controlled trials have shown that male circumcision provided by well trained health professionals in properly equipped settings is safe. WHO/UNAIDS recommendations emphasize that male circumcision should be considered an efficacious intervention for HIV prevention in countries and regions with heterosexual epidemics, high HIV and low male circumcision prevalence.</p>

It&#39;s convenient and relevant to do these studies on the African population because they have such high rates of HIV/AIDS, but as far as I know no one has suggested that lack of circumcision is the sole or major cause of the high rates. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>A blanket statement from WHO, but no mention of the science that would explain WHY snipping off a sheath of self lubricating nerve endings helps combat AIDS AT ALL.</p>

<p>Do you know why lube is a big deal in western sex? Because circumcised penises can have too much strain on the skin below the head. It can sometimes tear or cut if forced into a partner dry. This of course depends on the &#39;artistry&#39; or lack thereof of the original procedure.
And uncircumcised, unlubed  penises can hurt the partner as well. 
Foreskin not only helps lube your tip but is a more comfortable sheath for entry and initial in/out friction.
Source? My partners opinions and reactions to it vs. their experience with circumcised partners.</p>

<p>Now, why would WHO tell Africans that circumcision helps prevent AIDS when it can actually increase the chance of injury or blood exposure in a rape culture society? It&#39;s almost like they want to increase the spread of AIDS.</p>

<p>But that&#39;s something for another r/conspiracy post </p>

<p>Seems to me, evolution&#39;s plan was to protect our dongs while we&#39;re running through the jungle. Now we use pants for that instead</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t have the article, I read it a while ago. And many sites I see now have rushed to debunk it. It was just the first thing that came to mind.</p>

<p>But I can tell you from experience, at the daycare I taught at, in all the cases of children having infections on their penis (there were at least 4), 100% of them were not circumcised.</p>

<p>And sure many people will say that it&#39;s the parents job to teach him to clean out his turtle neck. But good luck teaching a two year old to do anything with his wiener other than pee out of it, or fiddle with it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Funny how no one research the effect on HIV contraction of cutting folds of skin off the female genitalia in the same sanitary conditions in which male circumcision was studied, especially since uncircumcised females are 2-3x more likely to contract HIV from unprotected vaginal sex than uncircumcised males.</p>
