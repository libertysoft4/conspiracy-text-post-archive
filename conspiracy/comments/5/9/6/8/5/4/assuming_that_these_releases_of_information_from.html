        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I haven&#39;t seen a discussion of this anywhere yet. Seriously, what should our next move be? The cat is out of the bag and the information is circling the world. Anything on any social media channel that involves HRC is completely full of people tearing into her. The only supporters left are shills or complete idiots. Although those two groups are one in the same. The most hardcore of democratic supporters (at one time I was one) are changing their stances in light of this information. I think that if she wins, the only explanation is serious voter fraud.</p>

<p>The worst mistake we could possibly make if she gets the presidency is to let this information die and go cold. If worst comes to worst, there need to be protests and unification of the people. I say we need to get organized. If there has ever been a time in the entire history of humanity for people to collectively come together, this is it. Literally, the entire world&#39;s eyes are looking at America right now. Screw the consequences. If Julian Assange and his team at wikileaks can put the weight of our freedom on their shoulders, then so can we. They provided the information, it&#39;s our job to continue their work if their plan fails.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m sick of hearing about voter fraud.  It&#39;s constantly in the news as a &quot;non-issue&quot;, but it&#39;s only in the news because so long as they keep chanting how voter fraud is non-existent, they&#39;re not covering the very serious implications of election fraud.  It&#39;s an elaborate smoke screen.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>[SEROUS]  If nothing happens to Hillary and she is elected after ALL of this information, I would seriously consider blaming the meme nature with which this information has been released.  Since almost all of this information is tied with memeing, especially <a href="/r/the_donald">/r/the_donald</a> posts (as much as I love that sub) it almost creates an inauthenticity in the subconscious.  Like the information is a joke since it is tied to jokes.</p>

<p>I can honestly say we need to stop memeing and start taking this information VERY seriously, similar to how Donald&#39;s demeanor became hyper serious debate 3 compared to debate 1.  This corruption is digusting, and the response should NOT be a meme, &quot;Lock her up or otherwise&quot;    We need to be calling for resignations right NOW.  If we don&#39;t, the FBI, DOJ and White House have already shown that they wont.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The system will only do that when it is necessary to preserve itself, like cutting off a gangrenous limb. I think we&#39;re quite a ways away from that because the leadership of this system is tied to her, both psychologically and criminally. Those on the edge can&#39;t quite bring themselves to throw her overboard.</p>

<p>If your goal is to stop Clinton, winning the election is essential. If your goals are broader, you might want her to win, because when shit does hit the fan, guess who&#39;s going to get the blame?</p>

<p>Personally, I find that kind of theorycrafting distasteful and arrogant. Who can know what will be better in the long run? Regardless, I suppose its best to keep educating people as best we can and try to tip the balance toward accountability. Sorry for the rant.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not a problem, thanks for sharing your thoughts. You bring up good points and that&#39;s what I was trying to convey as well. I don&#39;t think it&#39;s possible to get her thrown in jail, or else she would have by now</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Absolutely! Armed protestors will only incite retaliation from law enforcement. And once it starts, it will just spiral out of control. I think the best start would be the unification of all the individual activist organizations. Through all these individual groups reaching out to their members, we could reach a huge audience. On top of that would be celebrity involvement who have millions of followers we could reach</p>

<p>If a protest starts violent, you can just get labeled as a terrorist.
If a protest starts non-violent, then they&#39;ll hire violent protesters to join in and you get labeled as a terrorist.</p>

<p>F*** it then. I guess I&#39;ll be a terrorist. I would rather die for something I believe in than die quietly of old age</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Very fair point. However, the reasons for this kind of organized voice goes far beyond O&#39;Keefe&#39;s videos and does not live or die on that. The unedited versions would certainly be great, but it&#39;s hundreds of hours of video I&#39;m sure and would take more than a few hundred hours to analyze it all. I&#39;m not disagreeing with the importance of releasing it though. I personally think that the damning evidence is not just what they&#39;re saying in the video, but the tone of voice and body language when they&#39;re saying what they&#39;re saying.</p>

<p>This goes beyond this election. We need to address what the hell has been going on for the past 30 odd years. Social injustices, income inequality, corrupt high level business practices, shady international dealings, wars for resources that are paraded as freedom initiatives. It&#39;s time for America to get off its fat lazy ass, take a stand against what&#39;s going on, and demand some answers</p>
