        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>So apparently this guy is dropping hints left and right that Hillary&#39;s deleted emails are about to be dumped by Wikileaks.   This guy is either about to become a legend or the most irritating troll in history.   </p>

<p>Ten hours ago he tweeted a video of himself acting mock surprised with the audio &quot;you&#39;ve got mail&quot; @ Wikileaks.    He has been suggesting for months that the big leak would come on Hillary&#39;s birthday (today).  Trump said at one point that the leaks could have come from &quot;some 400 pound guy lying in bed.&quot;   Kim is 385 pounds.     </p>

<p>There is a lot of suspicion that Assange is either dead or has been kidnapped by the US.   The Wikleaks Twitter feed is just bizarre at this point.   However Kim is supposedly a friend of Assange, which gives me hope.  </p>

<p>Will Kim/Wikileaks come through?   Are we being trolled?   WTF is going on?  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Assange and KDC have some relationship, because Assange appeared by VC at a KDC event in New Zealand a couple of years ago. </p>

<p>The only thing is that KDC is battling extradition and also knows he was under sting-ray type surveillance once before. </p>

<p>So KDC and JA should reasonably suspect that KDC is under full surveillance, and has been for a very long time. Therefore I conclude that JA / Wikileaks would not have taken the risk to send stuff to KDC just from an opsec viewpoint. (Let alone that KDC is a bit rouge and reasonably unpredictable.) but JA likely shared the sort of thing that he had, so all KDC knows is that it&#39;s big but might not have the actual content. </p>

<p>My conclusion is that KDC is just firing people up, and he thinks JA is going to release good stuff - and is hoping that JA is still able to release it.....</p>

<p>But the clock is ticking and JA is missing, and the wikileaks director and lawyers are dead. </p>

<p>Edit minor correction over who appears via vc. </p>

<p>KDC&#39;s latest tweet says to use Xkeyscore to get the missing emails. This is the infuriating thing to most of us who are aware of current NSA data collections - nothing can truly be deleted anymore. The official narrative has ignored this fact completely. It feels like a slap in the face to those of us who know the that it is out there.</p>

<p>Maybe the idea is to get the people all riled up asking these same questions... in that case, it&#39;s not really trolling, but posturing. In any case, whether or not he has access to these files, I doubt that they see the light of the web (I would love to be wrong).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Tweeting weird random partisan political things, some with misspelled words that appear on the surface to spell out a secret message such as &quot;HELP HIM&quot;, but I think this is someone pulling our chains. They could just Tweet &quot;HELP HIM&quot; straight up, instead of hiding a secret message. Someone controlling that Twitter is having some fun, Assange would not be pleased by the recent unprofessional activity that only aims to hurt their credibility.</p>

<p>DISCLAIMER: I&#39;m not saying there <em>isn&#39;t</em> a secret message hidden in those Tweets. There very possibly could be a secret message, but so far nothing too compelling has been found. &quot;HELP HIM&quot; is not very useful. We already know he needs help, they cut his internet ffs. So what I&#39;m getting at here is the secret message could be something else, like an encryption key. Maybe the weird Tweets were his dead man switch. I don&#39;t know.</p>

<p>All these Tweets started around the same time a bunch of new mods swooped into <a href="/r/wikileaks">/r/wikileaks</a> and took over, started creating a bunch of SJW &quot;rules&quot; and banning everyone, stickying cat pics, pushing &quot;proof of life&quot; threads which are actually old content from months/years ago, shit like that.</p>

<p>The actual LEAKS are probably still legit, as they are being published automatically on timers that nobody can stop. So basically the Wikileaks Twitter and subreddit (both compromised) have to just go along with it at this point. Controlling the opposition methinks.</p>

<p>Start with these two threads:</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It makes sense that the cat account would be dark when his Internet is cut. It was cut for the purpose of not influencing the election, which means they probably also wouldn&#39;t allow anyone to see him or speak to him til after the election, assuming he&#39;s still at the embassy as Ecuador says. I&#39;m not saying I believe that story either, I&#39;m just trying to maintain a healthy level of skepticism about everything until more solid proof is revealed either way.

    <div class="md"><p>Well, for one, he&#39;s not a fucking prisoner and still has rights. Silencing him in any capacity is inhumane. The only reason they would silence him is because he publishes things they don&#39;t like. (ie. the truth). Meanwhile, you have mainstream media plastering garbage claims on a minute to minute basis. Better silence them as well because they are totally &quot;influencing the US election&quot;.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well for one, the MSM members are US citizens. Assange is not. Furthermore, Ecuador is currently accountable for Assange because they are protecting him from the the powers that be. By leaving Assange to do as he will Ecuador would, by proxy, be influencing the US election. They had to make a choice, cut off his Internet or piss off the world&#39;s biggest terrorist organization... Which would you choose? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>There are plenty of MSM sources located outside of the US. They have not only cut his internet but effectively made him a prisoner inside the embassy. Zero communication, visitors, or proof of life in the 11 days since. Plenty of ways to provide this without internet assuming he is still alive and/or in the embassy still. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I use that argument a lot against others.</p>

<p>Don&#39;t even try to use it against me. You&#39;re asking us:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>how do you ip trace a twitter post?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>My answer:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Metadata</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Which is:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>A set of data that describes and gives information about other data</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And with a little research on the topic you could perhaps</p>

<p>....find the information you&#39;re looking for</p>

<p>Maybe the idea is to get the people all riled up asking these same questions... in that case, it&#39;s not really trolling, but posturing. In any case, whether or not he has access to these files, I doubt that they see the light of the web (I would love to be wrong).</p>
