How do you get people to act? You <em>scare</em> them into action.<br/>
How do you get people to act the way you want? You only present them with actions you want them to take.</p>

<p><em>This</em> is what all the crazy news around Hillary and Trump is about. They want you the get so scared about either one of them that you vote for the other. And they only talk about these two candidates.</p>

<p>And I’m <em>not</em> saying there is no truth to the stuff leaking, but this is the reason we see it now. If you are voting in the US election, please keep this in mind.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I understand what you mean. The only reason this is going on now is to scare enough people into voting so that the &quot;winner&quot; has legitimacy.</p>

<p>And sadly, the special twist with this election is to cause civil uproar. If Hillary wins despite all the corruption she&#39;s been involved in, it will lead to that. And then the militarized police and the FEMA camps will come to use. This is their plan I think.</p>

<p>Disagree with this part.  A vote for JS is an endorsement for JS, not hillary.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Donald Trump has to fight against fraud, rigging, and the entire establishment.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Disagree with this part because little donny boy isn&#39;t going to do any of those things. He has a history of committing fraud of his own, to help himself make money, and long history of being complacent and participatory in the establishment.  Donald is just as much &quot;the establishment&quot; as any other candidate, it is naive to think otherwise.  </p>

<p>He has done nothing to lead me to believe he is honest or that his words are anything but hot air, marketing himself to the republican base.  He could have been using his vast wealth to fight the establishment for years if he really wanted to, but he was happier sitting back, participating in it, and collecting checks.  Fuck donald.</p>

<p>On that same topic, I don&#39;t know what will come of Trump&#39;s businesses if he becomes Pres. His son said they&#39;d put them in a blind trust but that&#39;s not what a blind trust is. You can&#39;t have a blind trust where you know all of the investments, property and assets in the trust. Could definitely be a conflict of interest. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I actually think less women want a woman president than initial logic would dictate. </p>

<p>Some do, on the woman card, I&#39;m sure, but many women prefer working under a male leader. Just like some males would vote for a beautiful female just because. </p>

<p>But no, just an oddly middle of the road hippatriot. I don&#39;t like Clinton. But I like trump even less. And I keep trying to find good in his policies, but it&#39;s hard. I agree with a few, to be sure. </p>

<p>I took the quiz a while back and aligned with stein 93%, Clinton and Johnson in the 70&#39;s and mr trump a mere 30%. </p>

<p>If I could agree with his ideas more on policy and tax matters, I&#39;d be able to ignore the dog whistling. I agree that she has media support, that there&#39;s a major bias. I agree that politicians need accountability, but I also think courts and Leo reform is part of that. It&#39;s not RIGHT to scape goat everything on Clinton and Obama, if we&#39;re going to start draining the swamp, it needs to be CLEANED. EVERY single one would need to be ousted and investigated. </p>

<p>And that this IMO, would be the best election chance a third party has had in years, yet neither of THOSE options is quite good enough for everyone to unite behind either. If there was 1 strong third party option, they would have a chance, but with a 4 way split, eh.. </p>

<p>And she has threatened to erase Iran from the map if they screw with Isreal.  And she is responsible for Gaddafi, which is responsible for Syria, which is responsible for the refugee crisis and European hellscape (<a href="https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=rRkFEMUDwwU">https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=rRkFEMUDwwU</a> watch the first 8 or so minutes of that and tell how you feel...)</p>

<p>And her tax policy will make an already bleak economy even worse.</p>

<p>And she truly is just a nasty woman. </p>

<p>She really is the worst candidate to run for President since W.</p>

<p>Everything leaking on HRC is actual revelation about how wicked that individual really is.  She has documents too classified for congress on her server.  That&#39;s treason.  She is guilty of multiple FEC violations.  She has a horrible personality and people generally don&#39;t like her.

    <div class="md"><p>Here&#39;s my problem with the &#39;They are in it together&#39; theory:
If this were true , then they would have effectively been done after the primaries. However, instead of winding down everything has been ramping up. Because there is pretty much no way a third party candidate can get a majority of the vote; there&#39;s simply too many older people who don&#39;t &#39;get it&#39; still. So if no majority is reached then the House of Representatives gets to decide who the president is and clearly they will vote HRC in. So why continue spending all the money and whatnot?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>They need to keep up the charade until the end because people (especially the Trump people, who are seemingly more energetic and more invested) would be <em>pissed off</em> if they knew this was happening. Most importantly they need for the majority of their campaign staff to be reasonably convinced that it&#39;s a legitimate contest; that way the campaigns&#39; output (like the &#39;ramping up&#39; you&#39;re talking about) feels more genuine and the possibility of a damning leak is minimized. When you&#39;re perpetuating a fraud on this scale you want as few people as possible to be aware of it. I can&#39;t claim to know exactly what&#39;s going on, of course, but I have a strange feeling this is all being masterminded by forces above and beyond just the Clintons and the DNC.</p>

<p>How do you intend to do that?</p>

<p>Democrats are saying the same thing - that it&#39;s okay they&#39;re voting for a neocon warmonger because at least it&#39;s not Trump, and once she&#39;s elected, they can focus on making sure Clinton delivers on all her promises.</p>

<p>But, currently, Trump is the least bad candidate we have, whether you consider possibles or long shots. I would vote for Trump over Stein, Sanders, and certainly before Johnson (I wouldn&#39;t let that guy make me supper, let alone run my country).</p>

<p>Stein is just using this election to sit back and improve her political position for the future. She&#39;s no better than any other politician. She&#39;s not saying anything that&#39;s difficult to say. She&#39;s scoring points in the awakening of the golems/goyim.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re right, he&#39;s not a normal candidate. He&#39;s a plant who got where he is because Hillary wanted an opponent she thought she could clobber. If the Republicans had picked their candidate the usual way, Clinton would likely lose due to her being a universally hated criminal, but after she got the &quot;liberal&quot; media to legitimize Trump and give him literally more free coverage than any other candidate, she got her controlled opposition. The Rs tried to stop him, but with all the free advertising Hillary had secured for her old pal Donnie, he was unstoppable. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t really buy that argument that Hillary is behind Trump&#39;s rise. The guy has been mouthing off w/o any regard for most of his life. Its only natural he does it as a candidate. Did Hillary secretly hope Trump won the nomination? Yes, I think so as he would be the easiest for her to beat. But I don&#39;t think she has much control over the coverage -- the guy is a lunatic and the media was giving him the attention he so desired.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>yes. I read that one too. Honestly you think they are not going to strategize? When lions hunt they attack the weakest in the heard....is there anything unusual about the Clinton campaign trying to promote Trump? The weakest candidate (or so they thought)?</p>

<p>To be honest, the only reason I think this may <em>actually</em> be rigged is because Trump is doing so well. He is  national disgrace and an embarassment to this country that he&#39;s even in the running. I&#39;m not even talking about his policies I&#39;m just talking about his character.</p>

<p>This is the only evidence I see that something is rigged. Hillary should be slamming him by 90% in the polls. Could it be that Americans are so pissed off that they really are getting behind this clown? That&#39;s pretty sad that we can&#39;t even put forth some candidates worth voting for.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>In a way, I feel like it&#39;s got to be rigged - the whole thing is a joke. Donald fucking Trump? Really? That guy&#39;s been a joke all his life. How can people vote for a guy that can&#39;t pull together a sentence? Who can&#39;t help himself but freak out like a baby whenever someone looks at him the wrong way? Gotta be a fix, the emperor is naked as a jaybird.</p>

<p>But as I talk to friends, family, and neighbors who support him, it becomes clear that Americans have become so coddled and are so dumbed-down when it comes to politics in this country that they&#39;ll believe anyone and anything if it&#39;s fed to them the right way and that&#39;s how we get Trump. (Trump will say, &quot;sky purple. green. yes. beautiful. I tried to fuck it. I failed. But that sky, beautiful. Integrity.&quot; and his supporters will say, &quot;Trump promised a clean blue sky for us all! And he will achieve it!&quot;)</p>

<p><a href="http://www.politico.com/story/2012/11/jindal-end-dumbed-down-conservatism-083743">Bobby Jindal called this years ago</a> and tried to warn and work against it. But the GOP was too high on popular support to right the rails and now they&#39;ve seen their entire party torn asunder by this giant mistake. Which, even for those who dislike the GOP, we have to understand really fucks us as the American people. It gives the Democrats no real opposition, and definitely no organized or intelligent opposition. Although one could say there&#39;s honestly no real difference in the Clinton platform or a Bush platform or an Obama platform at this point. It&#39;s all just words, she is, for all intents and purposes, a Kissinger-worshiping neo-conservative rubbing her hands ready for war. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ll admit i was somewhat intrigued in the beginning. Did you see Michael Moore&#39;s surmise of Trump and his rise? He hit it on the head. The middle class or (ex-middle class) are so pissed off, Trump is a human molotiv cocktail they can just toss into the middle of the system. I however thought this in the beginning. but now the guy scares me that its actually coming true. I think people are going to actually vote for this troll w/ a 3rd grade level of intelligence.</p>

<p>Nobody had any idea he was going to make it this far. There were 16 candidates to chose from for christ sake. They <em>all</em> sucked. Trump is the one we get. lol</p>

<p>You&#39;re right this will be the nail in the coffin. I do think there will be a 3rd party rise though, hopefully. I&#39;d like to see some more libertarian and independent candidates out there next time around.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah. Most of my discussions with people end with this sort of, &quot;You know, you&#39;re right about Trump, but maybe he&#39;ll surprise us! We know what we get with Hillary.&quot; And they won&#39;t, absolutely refuse refuse, to see a third party candidate as an option, no matter what. On the Trump as Clinton plant thing, they just go, &quot;Well, I don&#39;t think so, but so what if you&#39;re right? Our movement is stronger than Trump!&quot; (What movement? How will you folks get him to do what you want when he sees you as expendable rubes?)</p>

<p>And you&#39;re right - a lot people just want to see the world burn. I kind of get it for some, but if you&#39;ve got kids, grandkids, nieces and nephews, I just don&#39;t get it. &quot;Fuck my grandkids, let&#39;s destroy it all.&quot; Like they themselves could survive the loss of their social security checks? Like they&#39;d actually &quot;go work.&quot; The joke around our house is that your right to vote should be rescinded at 65. All these comfortable, well-off people we know, scared to death and gleeful about lobbing a molotov cocktail at the planet, not caring what&#39;s going to happen next.</p>

<p>It absolutely kills me because so many people are unhappy about the choices this year, I know more <em>a few</em> more enthusiastic Trump voters than Clinton voters, but that changes every day and both sides are demoralized. If everyone who believed this election to be bullshit voted third party, we could actually see a change. But everyone&#39;s so chickenshit.</p>

<p>Read that. Wikileaks confirmed that the Clinton camp actively encouraged the media that they have SERIOUS influence over to give Trump free media coverage and legitimize him. And yeah, the Clinton camp has a lot of control over the media. Wikileaks has also exposed direct collusion where the DNC chair can call up the president of a cable network and tell them to kill a story. Happened during the primaries, but with all these Podesta emails, we&#39;ve gotten an even greater peam at their collusion and the way they use &quot;friendly journalists&quot; to plant stories for them. Dont kid yourself, CNN wouldn&#39;t have been marathoning Trump&#39;s rallies and refusing to call him on his bullshit if Clinton didn&#39;t want that to happen. </p>

<p>i think you&#39;re exaggerating a bit. I&#39;ve read a lot of these emails and people are making a big deal about nothing.</p>

<p>One reporter sent his profile piece to Podesta so he could let him know if he missed anything. Its a common courtesy. Its not like Podesto wrote the fucking article, he was just getting some feedback and everyone flips out saying &quot;media is rigged&quot; and &quot;clinton owns the media&quot;.</p>

<p>They do the same thing if a reporter contacts them or vice versa which is pretty common. Everyone loses their mind. Truth is you&#39;d be a pretty shitty journalist if you <em>didn&#39;t</em> reach out for comment from people you were writing about.</p>

They&#39;re using every underhanded and illegal tactic in the book to give themselves the upper hand, and they are using the media to create popular opinion that suits  their needs, just like when they branded all Bernie supporters women haters.</p>

<p>If the republicans had picked their candidate the usual way, they would have lost. Trump is the best possible candidate they could have had. Any other candidate would have been just as destroyed by the media if not worse and they would have buckled. Also you seem to underestimate the amount of republicans that hate the GOP. The second choice would have been Cruz, and Cruz would have been a complete disaster. He&#39;s even more unlikable than Trump is and the highly religious candidates put people who aren&#39;t hardcore republicans off A LOT.</p>

<p>Now that Soros has managed to set up voting machines everywhere the election is most likely rigged on an entirely different level.</p>

As it is, her slightly craftier corruption, voluminous as it is, pales in comparison to Trump&#39;s in-your-face-stupid corruption (the rape case, the tax evasion, the mafia ties, the human trafficking, the flip-flops, the utter inability to speak coherently about anything of substance) and she becomes &quot;Well, at least she&#39;s not Trump.&quot;</p>

<p>It&#39;s a fucking fix. The Republicans failed and fell into yet another Clinton trap, they showed no moral character and we&#39;re going to end up with those gross, tacky, grifter Clintons in the White House <em>again.</em> And greedy idiots who think Trump is some kind of savior aided and abetted them. I&#39;m livid, quite honestly.</p>

<p>Now you&#39;re just full CTR. Literally none of these are true, proven, or in some cases even illegal.</p>

<p>You seem to be under the impression that the things people believe about Trump are based on reality, and aren&#39;t just media spins. They are not. Kasich would have been labeled the exact same things and he would have been destroyed by it. You seem to think Kasich wouldn&#39;t have 10 rape accusers out right now, but he would have. Trump can armor through and come out alive. </p>

<p>Not defending modern feminists either. Equal or special, not both. </p>

<p>You can post on Reddit, hate trump, and not be part of some shadowy cabal. Shills are not new, and used by ALL sides. While it is reasonable to suspect everyone, it&#39;s not reasonable to convince yourself that everyone is. All this does is deepen the rift that keeps us fighting amongst ourselves, all sure only the opposition is wrong, and that we MUSt be correct, in everything, because the other side is broken. </p>

<p>I do not think kasich would have rape accusers, no. That&#39;s just stupid. Like REALLY fucking stupid. While I think they&#39;re mostly overblown accusations, and while I think he was likely being a creep who gets away with things, I don&#39;t think trump raped a bunch of ladies. Grouped and seduced, yes. </p>

<p>And I hate that dude. In an Ohioan , not a fan of kasich either, tbh, but if there were dirt, it would be better suited to his actual misconduct. Not sexual assault. Kasich likes pink Floyd and sold weed.the narrative is t generic, it&#39;s tailored. </p>

And her foreign policy is a nightmare.  The current Chairman for the Joint Chiefs of Staff has stated that her no fly zone will result in war with Russia <a href="http://www.globalresearch.ca/clintons-no-fly-zone-over-syria-will-not-save-lives-it-will-lead-to-war-with-russia-warning-of-jcs-chairman-general-dunford/5552480">http://www.globalresearch.ca/clintons-no-fly-zone-over-syria-will-not-save-lives-it-will-lead-to-war-with-russia-warning-of-jcs-chairman-general-dunford/5552480</a></p>

<p>And she has threatened to erase Iran from the map if they screw with Isreal.  And she is responsible for Gaddafi, which is responsible for Syria, which is responsible for the refugee crisis and European hellscape (<a href="https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=rRkFEMUDwwU">https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=rRkFEMUDwwU</a> watch the first 8 or so minutes of that and tell how you feel...)</p>

<p>And her tax policy will make an already bleak economy even worse.</p>

<p>And she truly is just a nasty woman. </p>

<p>She really is the worst candidate to run for President since W.</p>
