    <div class="md"><p>the commonly held opinion here is that it&#39;s a scam and that Trump is false opposition, he is in fact a Clinton donor and family friend who has mysteriously appeared on the political scene to &quot;run against&quot; a Clinton and take over/discredit her opposition. It&#39;s the American equivalent of Putin&#39;s wife being set up to &quot;run for president of Russia&quot; <em>against</em> a Putin donor and long-time family friend/Putin&#39;s golf buddy (which is what Trump is to Clinton).</p>

<p>Sorry, as an anarchist too I have to disagree. Government by nature is not evil, it is what we make of it where the evil lies. For example, I believe in self government, where the people organize themselves for tasks that are needed. I believe this is the main difference between libertarians and anarchists. See <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org%20/wiki/Tragedy_of_the_commons">tragedy of the commons</a> for example where self government is needed.</p>

<p>On that I agree. I was only disagreeing with your original statement that by nature &quot;government is evil&quot;. It is not just semantics, but as I posted, I believe it is one of the main difference between libertarians and anarchists. Our system was in part based on &quot;the social contract&quot; (consent of the governed), which, while not perfect, still much better than what we have now.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re fucked either way actually because if you go left, you go to more government - which you&#39;re correct in saying it in point of fact most definitely <em>does</em> seem very much evil.  However, if you go far right, you get less/no government...but more (often a <em>lot</em> more) global, multinational, corporate control - which in the end is almost the same thing because the corporation is no less powerful and conniving and controlling than the government.</p>

<p>Matter of fact, more often than not, it&#39;s actually <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMNZXV7jOG0"><em>more</em> conniving and powerful than the government.</a></p>

<p>Left right, bro...left right.  <a href="https://www.subjectmoney.com/The%20Illusion%20of%20Free%20Choice%20democrats%20republicans.jpg">All leads to the same end.</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>There are two versions of anarchism.  One is authentic, and does not really advocate anything other than moral self-responsibility; although I&#39;m definitely not talking about the AnClaps, here.

<p>The second type is the travesty that exists in <a href="/r/Anarchism">/r/Anarchism</a> now; which is a Marxist hijacking that is exclusively and vindictively obsessed with minority politics to the exclusion of all else, and which also has authoritarian moderators who are more than happy to ban people who express non-approved opinions.</p>

<p>Incorrect actually.  I just posted to them about the left/right paradigm - independent of anarchy one way or the other.  I made a comment favoring anarchy, but it was separate from and unrelated to the left/right paradigm statement I initially made.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>It’s certainly not left or right, but I don’t know if it’s the bottom of the scale one way or the other.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Think of a cross. Think Feudalism at the top, anarchy on the bottom.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Seems arbitrary to me.  Don’t know what one being on top as opposed to the bottom (or the other way around, for that matter) means really.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It&#39;s not a hard concept, if you know what you are talking about</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Well, I DIDN’T know what you were talking about.  And that’s why I asked.  Mate.</p>

<p>Pretty simple.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Also, fuck Gnome (pun intended). Zionist Jew, he is.... He&#39;s for the left-right authoritarian paradigm....</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And yet everything he said about what anarchism is is correct - which was the reason I linked that video.</p>

<p>You seem to let your personal opinions blind your ability to discern validity and truth.  That’s…not good.  It’s not about Noam or whoever else.  It literally could have been anybody saying what was said.  It’s not about the speaker.  It’s about what was said and the information the video contained.  That’s it.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>which is by far the biggest portion of government and government spending</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is actually false and a common misconception. The defense budget makes up the largest portion of <em>discretionary</em> spending i.e. a set budget allocated by Congress to certain programs each year through the appropriations process. </p>

<p>The <em>mandatory</em> spending budget contains a set of programs where funding is determined by eligibility rules such as Social Security and Medicare/Medicaid. The mandatory budget is usually adjusted less than once per year and is set by reviewing enrollments, determining eligibility and adjusting benefits </p>

<p>For comparison, here are the current top three most expensive government programs with percentage of overall federal spending shown in parenthesis:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Social Security ~ 1.25 Trillion (33%)</p>

<p>Medicare/Medicaid ~ 1 Trillion (28%)</p>

<p>Defense ~ 600 Billion (16%)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As you can see, social entitlements make defense spending look like like chump change. There&#39;s a very legitimate argument for allocating some of those entitlement trillions toward defense, especially when countless high-potential DoD programs get cut every year from lack of funding and global threat analyses project a need for several multibillion dollar weapon system procurements over the next few decades to safeguard American hegemony. </p>

<p>I mean, a lot of what Trump says could almost be word-for-word out of the mouth of Noam Chomsky.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>He knows the crowd.  He knows how they are feeling, and he knows which issues they want to hear him talking about.  He also knows which opinions the people want him to <strong><em>express</em></strong> about those issues.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t think Trump is remotely sincere; although to be fair, Hillary is even less.  I just think he has fantastic advisers and handlers who give him great scripts, which accurately describe which particular set of lies is going to cause the people to believe that he cares about them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s not.  Questions such as these seem like propaganda taint against this sub masquerading as a question, so I can tell you shoud that be the case, we don&#39;t appreciate it.</p>

<p>Lets&#39; assume that&#39;s overly hypervigilant and it&#39;s an earnest question: You cannot say anything about this sub right now.  It&#39;s been taken over by a sea of people who are--let&#39;s say--guests and they are posting fluff and nonsense and quibbling about things in a way that are uncritical and jusfitying to the establishment.</p>

<p>if you see a bunch of antisemite stuff, such as holohoax or jews did 911 (wrong, cheney did), that&#39;s not the normal &#39;regulars&#39; here, although there is a contingent of people--very small percentage of &#39;regulars&#39;--that post that stuff.  Regulars have a very fair and clear understanding of what&#39;s been going on, and yes we aren&#39;t afraid of saying that there&#39;s a disproportionate number of jewish people in the media and film, but the idea that this group controls everything is just not true; it woudn&#39;t be true to say the catholic church controls the world either, but it would certainly be <em>more true</em> than the jewish world controller model of reality</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ll tell you another thing.  There are a lot of Bernie and Jill stein supporters here.  That should say something, but if you think that this sub since oct 17 is a good view of what this sub is like, I can tell you it&#39;s just not so.  We&#39;re complaining about what&#39;s happening on critical shower thoughts</p>

<p>I think my ignore list probably contains around five usernames from here, now.  You&#39;re correct that it isn&#39;t a large number of people, but unfortunately what they lack in numbers, they can compensate for with volume.</p>

<p>It isn&#39;t a Jewish conspiracy, so much as it is a conspiracy of the psychopathic and exceptionally intelligent.  Those two factors <strong><em>seem</em></strong> to have a mild tendency to intersect a little more frequently within the Jewish population than most; but there are still <strong><em>plenty</em></strong> of Gentiles in the club, and they aren&#39;t all at the bottom of the totem pole, either.  Psychopathy, tenacity, money, and political aptitude are the cabal&#39;s real prerequisites for membership; not ethnicity.</p>

They march us towards totalitarianism. That&#39;s the whole use for the &#39;dichotomy&#39;</p>

<p>When you tire of the war circus as presented, they switch to the environmental mentality that intends the same kind of slavery and death for most of us  in the end. The real battle is between  balanced human beings and psychopaths in leadership positions.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s not? It just covers the stories that get deleted and banned from the extremely left wing r/ politics.</p>

<p>Post an anti hillary story if you want. You might get hate because of what happened in politics, but I dont think it would be censored.</p>

<p>The Hillary emails are being hidden in the MSM. Trump stories are front page. Ask why the entirety of the media is so left wing.</p>

<p>Many of us arent Trump supporters or werent.
I have been banned and attacked viciously in left wing groups when i disagree, but accepted and kindly disagreed with in right wing groups. I hated on both and alwayd daid my vote would go to Stein or Johnson.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve been on Reddit six years now, and also spent three on 4chan.  Before that, I was largely a centrist.  Nihilistic and cynical, yes; I&#39;d read the Protocols and have always considered 9/11 an inside job, but I still had a fair amount of sympathy for the Left.</p>

<p>Then I came here, and actually interacted with some of them, and things changed.  I came to expect everything I wrote to be downvoted <em>en masse</em> if my statements were not what the majority wanted to hear, or violated the unwritten, unchallengeable dogma of the sub I was in, and that was everywhere.  I realised that more than anything else, the reason why the Left use silent downvoting to punish those they disagree with, is because they <strong><em>do not know how</em></strong> to engage in genuine debate.  Most progressives have virtually no genuine education; and by genuine, I mean one that was not designed by Fabian Socialists.</p>

<p>I have never seen more pure hatred anywhere in my life, than I have from Marxists of various kinds towards their opponents.  I&#39;ve seen plenty of other people do unspeakable things to each other; but I&#39;ve never seen the actual hate more intense before.  You honestly won&#39;t see anything close to it among the fascists on 4chan.  They are sick for their own reasons, yes; but said reasons don&#39;t include that.  I&#39;ve read the SCUM Manifesto.  I&#39;ve been in IRC channels where women were obsessed with creating a safe space, and found out I was male.  The patriarchy dominated women, yes.  Feminists don&#39;t want to dominate men, however; they want us to <strong><em>completely cease to exist.</em></strong></p>

<p>The other single main difference between the Left and the Right on the Internet, is that if I go to <a href="/r/Socialism">/r/Socialism</a> and express more than a single opinion that someone else there disagrees with, I will at the very least be on a five minute post timer, and will be downvoted into oblivion.  Conversely, if I am among self-admitted fascists, Objectivists, or Anarcho-Capitalists, then I can openly tell them that I consider their philosophy vile, (because I often do) and they will ask me to explain my position.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There&#39;s information about corruption due to previous positions held on one side while the other has what, probable tax evasion and offshore accounts? Exposing the former fits in the sub. Same reason leaks are so one-sided. As a result some end up looking to the other side. You can always ignore those posts along with the disinfo spam. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Do you see how this sub is being taken over by the_donald? It&#39;s really sad to see because half the shit that gets posted on here is ridiculous and a quarter isn&#39;t even conspiracy based, but finding ways to push trump propaganda. We can not be fed into thinking Reddit is being taken over by only CTR, both sides are very prevalent on here and each side takes their own subs and the people who are against both sides are stuck with shit propaganda coming from everywhere and it&#39;s nauseating. As you can tell, I can&#39;t wait for this shit election to be done with</p>
