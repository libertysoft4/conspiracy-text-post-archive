Stage 2 was the creation of the most recent and current Federal Reserve in 1913, coupled with the 1934 Gold Confiscation.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Very Few people in the South owned slaves. Only 5% of the population owned slaves.And the North to a lesser degree did as well.
Let&#39;s not forget about the Barbary Coast Pirates who enslaved Europeans for centuries, just prior to European immigrants in America enslaving North Africans. Read up on Thomas Jefferson and how/why the Navy was created to defeat the Pirates that were capturing Europeans. </p>

<p>*Update: I will check on the 5% and provide sources or change it. Might take a few days, I&#39;m slammed with school work.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, but they still owned slaves dude. And the whole point of the war was the South defending themselves (rightly so) against a foreign government imposing its will. It just so happens that this was the end of slavery. Was this perhaps by design? A crafted war to bring about some new socioeconomic change? Well, I wouldn&#39;t be surprised there.</p>

<p>A Venezuelan friend (relevant because of the non-american perspective) said it best: &quot;The South fought the wrong war for all the right reasons&quot;</p>

<p>I&#39;m not going to delve into other people who owned slaves. That is off topic from what I am discussing here.</p>

<p>Oh, and as for the racism aspect. The South was lynching blacks for a century + after the war, not to mention the institutional racism, aka Jim Crow laws.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Your information is incorrect. In the southern states, between 1/4 and 1/3 of free white men/families owned slaves. Most of the whites that couldn&#39;t afford slaves still desired them, but were simply too poor. That 5% you reference means that 5% owned the majority of the slaves, not all. They owned something like 95% of slaves - most of the slaveholders only owned two or three.</p>

<p>More than any other society on the planet, America is fundamentally about two things; money and narcissistic supply.  As long as that is true, anything close to genuine integrity is simply not possible.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>A coup happens in America every few years.  The last one was in 2000; but then again, it would probably be more true to say that it was the last one which was blatantly obvious.</p>

<p>I will admit that when I see Americans as horrified as many of you are, about what a corrupt rats&#39; nest your government is, I feel empathy for you, as I&#39;ve already known about it for more than 20 years now.  I remember the early moments for me, though; that feeling where you put your hand over your mouth or your eyes in horror, and you realise that you can probably never trust anyone again, or at least no one in government.</p>

<p>Once you learn that though, the next challenge is to avoid losing faith in humanity completely.  I&#39;m still working on that one.</p>

How about we as a nation (or at least Reddit users) demonstrate like those who marched on Washngton to inspire the end of the Vet Nam &quot;Police action&quot;? Would we now be considered terrorist?

    <div class="md"><p>The first thing, the hardest thing, is to organize and put together a centralized mission/list of demands. This is hard to do when there is so much that needs to be fixed. It is also becoming exceedingly difficult to stay on message when the nature of privatized social media allows for easily controlled brigading. And when almost all the mainstream news media is clearly a primary enemy, when it should be a tool for investigative journalists to inform the public. </p>

<p>So where to start? I believe in a successful movement you have to keep it simple and direct in the beginning: Stingrays. Kill the Stingrays. </p>

<p>Really, the bottom line is that the people no longer have control over our government. What better blatant demonstration of this currently exists? Stingrays directly violate our civil rights; there is more than enough evidence regarding their operation that there is absolutely no question that they do. </p>

<p>We thought NSA surveillance was scary, but that&#39;s nothing compared to agencies being able to perform targeted spying at the local level for whatever reasons they see fit. That is THE silver bullet of revolution, my friends. </p>

<p>Why do you think they flew over the Baltimore protests? It wasn&#39;t to protect the city. It was to make sure that riots remained riots and so no one who started saying anything important would be outside of their realm of control. </p>

<p>A glimpse of the future. If you can squash unrest surgically, at the local level, it will never become part of the national conversation. </p>

<p>So that&#39;s where we start. Kill the Stingrays. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, the big problems are lack of awareness and more importantly no incentive to broadcast and accept opposing viewpoints. It is both a symptom of the chilling effect and the emotional human desire for confirmation of one&#39;s own beliefs by peers. Take a look at the state of Facebook (but really most social media platforms). It is a free &quot;service&quot;, but the &quot;product&quot; is you, your time, and your interaction data. So of course it is designed as a time sink, where you think you&#39;re communicating freely but in reality spending time in the nice curated little echo chamber that has been created for you. If you do some experiments you&#39;ll find how true this is. My long detailed political posts barely show up, if even at all, to (most of) my friends news feeds, because they are far from click magnets. Whereas simple and riskless posts with pictures, like a fuck Trump meme, or a fuck Hillary meme, or a &quot;Hey, remember Dragonball Z&quot; are pumped up to the top because it&#39;s easy for viewers to go, &quot;Heh&quot;, click to provide some more sentiment data, and move on quickly to do some more clicking. </p>

<p>Adding to that, in general, in the last decade or so, the social walls blocking any reasonable discourse critical of government have been built up pretty high. It totally amazes me that even though most people accept that there was definitely some government fuckery involved in JFK&#39;s assassination, as soon as you mention any (very real) questions about 9/11, those same people completely shut down and stop taking anything you say seriously. </p>

<p>That&#39;s a problem. Not because of that particular subject matter; the facts of which can be debated from here to the moon, but because people still firmly believe we&#39;re being protected by the good guys. When I hear average civilians talk flippantly about how Snowden should be locked up, it frightens me. &quot;If you aren&#39;t doing anything wrong, you have nothing to hide.&quot; They are too far removed from the reality of the situation to care. If there was an unmarked van outside across the street with a satellite dish on the roof, pointing at their house, even Mister Rogers would be nervous and embarrassed, probably sing a little quieter. Since they don&#39;t need the van anymore, there is nothing imposing upon your senses to disturb you, so you just don&#39;t care they&#39;re doing it.  Looking ahead, that&#39;s so goddamn dangerous. </p>

<p>We are so distracted by things that don&#39;t matter. Race, religion, political leanings. Keeps us from organizing anything effectively. Media-driven echo chambers fuel this so hard. You can use the Black Lives Matter vs. All Lives Matter argument as a pure case study for this. Think of how much steam they would have behind their movement if they all dropped the divisive labels and became the Americans For Police Accountability. Hey, with that much focus we could&#39;ve fought against the over-militarization of local police forces, no-knock warrants for nonviolent drug offenders, racial profiling, lack of body cameras, lack of training for nonviolent conflict resolution, etc. </p>

<p>Nope. Echo chambers. All talk. It is our job to slowly break down the walls of these echo chambers. Google and their &quot;fact checking&quot; are about to make that a lot harder, and sometimes I can&#39;t believe that we are actually living during this permanent turning point of society. </p>

<p>The Constitutional system has undergone gradual erosion ever since the initial signing; although what people are realising these days is that it was truthfully overrated to begin with.  Rome proved that you can not have a legislative branch that is not perpetually corrupt.  Senates are always populated by the elderly, and fear of impending death can cause people to try and grab everything they can, while they can.  The old tend to be driven by resentment to make war upon the young, as well; at least in Western society.</p>

<p>Waco was really when the Jeffersonian party genuinely ended, though; that was a huge and chronic violation of Posse Comitatus, and in the end hardly anyone said a word.  That was a test by the government, and the public failed.  You are now dealing with the consequences, in terms of the domestic militarisation of the police.</p>

<p>The Civil War did a lot of damage and set a lot of bad precedents; that of course more or less solidified the Union as an idea.  Then there was the gold grab and the Federal Reserve act in 1914, as well.  Some cite the New Deal as a bit of renaissance, but the only real reason why FDR did that, was to keep people willing to participate in the centralised/federal economy, because for a year or two at least, the Depression had encouraged people to try alternatives.</p>
