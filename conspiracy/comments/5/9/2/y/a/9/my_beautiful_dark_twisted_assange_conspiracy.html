<p><em>Julian Assange is fine</em>. </p>

<p>If you&#39;re going to call attention to your cause, mysteriously disappearing while incredibly publicly challenging the United States is a fantastic way to do so. He wants the world to know what he has found. </p>

<p>The entire world is watching. Despite media suppression, this thing has some serious fucking legs. Everybody knows about it. It has hit the top of Worldnews despite the organization that shall go unnamed. T_D has made sure that the entire rest of Reddit knows about it.</p>

<p>Black ops work in the shadows - he is far too public to be disappeared.  Doing so would be the Streisand effect times a billion. You don&#39;t run an intelligence agency by being that stupid. This would be by far the most <strong>incredibly hamfisted</strong> thing an intelligence agency has ever done.</p>

<p>I <em>speculate</em> that the SVR is watching very closely looking for signs of fuckery. If he disappears permanently, and Putin finds evidence of wrongdoing, the entire world would know and it would humiliate the United States to a degree unmatched since the Barbary Pirates.</p>

<p><strong>As for what is going on with their Twitter:</strong> I have no fucking idea.</p>

<p>(side note, it&#39;s amusing that an organization built on transparency is not being particularly transparent)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I came to the OP&#39;s conclusion myself, but the deaths are what made me nix the idea. </p>

<p>Now that I think about it a little more...</p>

<p>The two events are NOT mutually exclusive. Wikileaks could be drumming up coverage for a big reveal, I seem to remember this happening once before but I can&#39;t put my finger on when. At the same time, the Clinton Mafia could be taking out his staff one by one with a different agenda. </p>

<p>The Twitter account is highly suspicious. Is it an attempt to hijack the method of communication? Silencing the voice can be easier than silencing the person. Less messy too. It also creates a rift. Divide and conquer. </p>

<p>We have read of the Dems using divide and conquer strategies throughout many of the leaks. </p>

<p>What other recent events have led to a split of the hive mind?</p>

<p>The <a href="/r/WikiLeaks">/r/WikiLeaks</a> takeover is one. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t what it was about the last 3-4 years. I remember saying the same exact thing a few months ago. At some point a few years back, the world went the fuck off the rails.</p>

<p>I think it&#39;s related to the global economic catastrophe and the internet. Being able to easily factually demonstrate why bullshit is wrong (the internet) has not stopped politicians from bullshitting. Secondly, being able to watch war without any censorship has shown people how nuts this world is.</p>

<p>Knowing American media this man will get more press if he&#39;s &#39;missing&#39; than if he leaked a new Kim kardashian sex tape. So when the time comes far more eyes will be in him and the facts than previously. Only a theory though. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The storyline that US pressured Ecuador to cut his Internet, and do nothing else, is bizarre - what with the DMS(es) deployed!
So yes, it is quite possible that all this drama was enacted to draw as much attention as possible to themselves - possibly before a dramatic revelation, or as a shot across the bow.
But then, I thought the Podesta Leaks were doing this job admirably - so why this additional sideshow?
It could also be that this was a smokescreen for JA&#39;s escape from the embassy.
And finally, given the file hashes released early last week, and applying the Occam&#39;s Razor, a Deal was made and executed between US, Ecuador, UK-FCO and JA.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Love it. Round of applause for you sir, you have restored my faith that JA may still be well and alive.</p>

<p>On a side note, I just had a thought that the twitter account is still safely in wikileaks control. Do you think that an American intelligence agency would be stupid enough to keep using the twitter account at this point? People have obviously caught onto the change in tone, just look at the comments on any of their posts. I&#39;m hoping beyond hope that the whole twitter fiasco at the moment is just another part of their plan to attract attention.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My thought is JA is not at the embassy and hasn&#39;t been for a while. We were supposed to see some showing/revelation a few weeks ago and it turns out it was just a anniversary special for WiKiLeaks. I do not think we&#39;ve seen a public appearance from him in quite some time and the last VTC was for the anniversary. I don&#39;t believe that his visitors, Pam Anderson, actually saw him. I do believe that he has not been extradited or taken in custody due to the efforts with the London Airport. They knew he was not there and where trying to stop an escape route. Everything so far to take him down has been evaded and we are seeing infiltration on SM. We will see more leaks and some big ones just don&#39;t expect them from WiKiLeaks. In my personal opinion the information that is yet to be revealed is not just about HRC, although the info is the deleted emails, but I believe the content is 911 related. If it was just HRC I don&#39;t see this much effort from the US to stop JA. There&#39;s some very damaging and historical defining information that is going to change they way we look at our government.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is a good theory, but I believe their entire business of wiki links has been compromised. Assange is to be permanently missing. CTR(shadow govt.) is going to keep wiki leaks open. But now the stories are going to be more favorable for the DNC. With  strong pushes that the leaks are not credible and are doctored by the MSM. Then , new leaks show that they are doctored , because the less favorable stories are OK to show the emails from the DNC now. Discrediting anything that has came out by wiki leaks. Assange, of course , is embarrassed that he has been &quot;exposed &quot; for being a liar/fraud and disappears to be never heard or seen again.  Not to mention he never was prosecuted for being a rapist( which will never happen as long as he is alive). Checkmate, little bug has been crushed and the NWO machine keeps rolling.</p>

<p>Edit: in this theory  , assange  died after the Internet was cut or around that time. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>How far back? Which incidents?</p>

<p>I think it&#39;s more than plausible that Russia hacked the DNC - but I also think it&#39;s more than plausible that the leaks were from intelligence/LE insiders.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think they&#39;ve had a heavy hand in determining WL agenda since Assange holed up in the embassy, maybe earlier.</p>

<p>Between the Russian security detail and the show on RT I think we can assume he has at least been in contact with one or more of Russia&#39;s security services for the last three years.</p>

<p>All this talk of his safety and whereabouts only serves to stir up theories of US/Western assassination plots, which serves to further throw the scent off of Russian involvement.</p>

<p>At least that&#39;s my conclusion based on the evidence available.</p>

<p>I think the DNC hacks were almost certainly Russian in origin.  Otherwise why use WL to publish?  Why not go directly to US based journalists who would be more than happy to protect your identity in return for an exclusive scoop?  Doesn&#39;t add up.</p>
