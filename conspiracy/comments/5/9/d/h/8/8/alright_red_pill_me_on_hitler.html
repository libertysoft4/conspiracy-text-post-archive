    <div class="md"><p>Here’s a story about a man that told bankers to shove it.</p>

<p>He became leader of a bankrupt nation where money was so worthless people burnt it for fuel. He fixed that by taking over all banks, by force, and making them serve his will. He started massive public works projects like upgrading roads, sewer systems, schools, housing projects and hydroelectric dams, and then hired everyone he could find and paid them in new, different money. All were paid a unit of currency for a unit’s worth of work, goods, or services.</p>

<p>His economy flourished, with money without inflation, backed by work and production, not debt. His final act sent the Rothschilds and Bilderbergs into a massive rage… What did he do? <strong>He banned interest on loans.</strong> He set up a new bank that loaned money for a small fee. Say you need $100, out here that&#39;s 25% interest, every month. But his bank? “You need 100 bucks? Sure, but you’ll pay me back $125, $25 a month.”</p>

<p>Imagine how much money you’d have if all the payday loan places were replaced with THIS. Combine this with his abolition of all sales taxes except for luxuries like cognac or diamond jewelry and you can imagine how well his people lived. This man passed a law which said that companies may only keep 25% of their profits. The rest must be spent on growing the company, hiring more workers, and providing them benefits. What happened to him? The bankers were afraid his prosperity would spread (and deprive them of their profits), so they forced him into a war and destroyed his works. The victors painted him as an utter monster so only the depraved or villainously stupid would wear his flag with pride (and even they accept the bankers’ version of events).</p>

<p>Who is this man? You probably know. You don’t need to say his name; everyone has heard it already.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sadly Walla thinks he&#39;s right so often he can&#39;t see when he&#39;s wrong. Hitler was a man of fate, and was definitely working for the banksters. After what Hitler did no one could say anything bad about Jews, even Zionist Jews. To gain leadership in Germany the banksters army burned down the parliament building, blaming it on the Russians. It gave Hitler an extra boost. Hitler put fluoride in the water. Hitler with the help of the banksters made Germany into a smaller shorter version of what USA is today. They had all the Germans against the banks. Just like today it&#39;s the opposite, no one knows banks are a problem without doing independent research.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Many people take joy in saying Wall Street and Jewish bankers “financed Hitler.” There is plenty of documented evidence that Wall Street and Jewish bankers did indeed help finance Hitler at first, partly because it allowed the bankers to get rich (as I will describe below) and partly in order to control Stalin. However, when Germany broke free from the bankers, they declared a world war against Germany. When we look at all the facts, the charge that “Jews financed Hitler” becomes irrelevant. Los Angeles Attorney Ellen Brown discusses this topic in her book Web Of Debt.</p>

<p>When Hitler came to power. Germany was hopelessly broke. The Treaty of Versailles had imposed crushing reparations on the German people, demanding that Germans repay every nation&#39;s costs of the war. These costs totaled three times the value of all the property in Germany. Private currency speculators caused the German mark to plummet, precipitating one of the worst runaway inflations in modern times. A wheelbarrow full of 100 billion-mark banknotes could not buy a loaf of bread. The national treasury was empty. Countless homes and farms were lost to speculators and to private (Jewish controlled) banks. Germans lived in hovels. They were starving. </p>

<p>Nothing like this had ever happened before - the total destruction of the national currency, plus the wiping out of people&#39;s savings and businesses. On top of this came a global depression. Germany had no choice but to succumb to debt slavery under international (mainly Jewish) bankers until 1933, when the National Socialists came to power. At that point the German government thwarted the international banking cartels by issuing its own money. World Jewry responded by declaring a global boycott against Germany.</p>

<p>Hitler began a national credit program by devising a plan of public works that included flood control, repair of public buildings and private residences, and construction of new roads, bridges. canals. and port facilities. All these were paid for with money that no longer came from the private international bankers. The projected cost of these various programs was fixed at one billion units of the national currency. To pay for this. the German government (not the international bankers) issued bills of exchange, called Labor Treasury Certificates. In this way the National Socialists put millions of people to work, and paid them with Treasury Certificates.</p>

<p>Under the National Socialists, Germany&#39;s money wasn&#39;t backed by gold (which was owned by the international bankers). It was essentially a receipt for labor and materials delivered to the government. Hitler said, “For every mark issued, we required the equivalent of a mark&#39;s worth of work done, or goods produced.” The government paid workers in Certificates. Workers spent those Certificates on other goods and services, thus creating more jobs for more people. In this way the German people climbed out of the crushing debt imposed on them by the international bankers. Within two years, the unemployment problem had been solved, and Germany was back on its feet. It had a solid, stable currency, with no debt, and no inflation at a time when millions of people in the United States and other Western countries (controlled by international bankers) were still out of work. Within five years, Germany went from the poorest nation in Europe to the richest.</p>

<p>Germany even managed to restore foreign trade, despite the international bankers’ denial of foreign credit to Germany, and despite the global boycott by Jewish-owned industries. Germany succeeded in this by exchanging equipment and commodities directly with other countries, using a barter system that cut the bankers out of the picture. Germany flourished, since barter eliminates national debt and trade deficits. (Venezuela does the same thing today when it trades oil for commodities, plus medical help, and so on. Hence the bankers are trying to squeeze Venezuela.) Germany’s economic freedom was short-lived, but it left several monuments, including the famous Autobahn, the world’s first extensive superhighway. </p>

<p>Hjalmar Schacht, a Rothschild agent who was temporarily head of the German central bank, summed it up thus... An American banker had commented, &quot;Dr. Schacht, you should come to America. We&#39;ve lots of money and that&#39;s real banking.&quot; Schacht replied, &quot;You should come to Berlin. We don&#39;t have money. That’s real banking.&quot; (Schact, the Rothschild agent, actually supported the private international bankers against Germany, and was rewarded by having all charges against him dropped at the Nuremberg trials.) </p>

<p>This economic freedom made Hitler extremely popular with the German people. Germany was rescued from English economic theory, which says that all currency must be borrowed against the gold owned by a private and secretive banking cartel–such as the Federal Reserve or the Central Bank of Europe–rather than issued by the government for the benefit of the people. Canadian researcher Dr. Henry Makow (who is Jewish himself) says the main reason why the bankers arranged for a world war against Germany was that Hitler sidestepped the bankers by creating his own money, thereby freeing the German people. Worse, this freedom and prosperity threatened to spread to other nations. Hitler had to be stopped! </p>

<p>Make, in <em>Hitler Did Not Want War</em>, quotes from the 1938 interrogation of C. G. Rakovsky, one of the founders of Soviet Bolsevism and a Trotsky intimate. Rakovsky was tried in show trials in the USSR under Stalin. According to Rakovsky, Hitler was at first funded by the international bankers, through the bankers&#39; agent Hjalmar Schacht. The bankers financed Hitler in order to control Stalin, who had usurped power from their agent Trotsky. Then Hitler became an even bigger threat than Stalin when Hitler started printing his own money. (Stalin came to power in 1922, which was eleven years before Hitler came to power.) </p>

<p>Rakovsky said: <em>Hitler took over the privilege of manufacturing money, and not only physical moneys, but also financial ones. He took over the machinery of falsification and put it to work for the benefit of the people. Can you possibly imagine what would have come ff this had infected a number of other states?</em></p>

<p>Economist Henry C. K. Liu writes of Germany’s remarkable transformation: <em>The Nazis came to power in 1933 when the German economy was in total collapse, with ruinous war-reparation obligations and zero prospects for foreign investment or credit. Through an independent monetary policy of sovereign credit and a full-employment public-works program. the Third Reich was able to turn a bankrupt Germany, stripped of overseas colonies, into the strongest economy in Europe within four years, even before armament spending began.</em> <strong>Henry C. K. Liu</strong>, <em>Nazism and the German Economic Miracle</em>, Asia Times (May 24, 2005)</p>

<p>In <em>Billions for the Bankers, Debts for the People</em> (1984), Sheldon Emry commented: <em>Germany issued debt-free and interest-free money from 1935 on, which accounts for Germany’s startling rise from the depression to a world power in five years. The German government financed its entire operations from 1935 to 1945 without gold, and without debt. It took the entire Capitalist and Communist world to destroy the German revolution, and bring Europe back under the heel of the Bankers?</em> </p>

<p>These facts do not appear in any textbooks today, since Jews own most publishing companies. What does appear is the disastrous runaway inflation suffered in 1923 by the Weimar Republic, which governed Germany from 1919 to 1933. Today&#39;s textbooks use this inflation to twist truth into its opposite. They cite the radical devaluation of the German mark as an example of what goes wrong when governments print their own money, rather than borrow it from private cartels. In reality, the Weimar financial crisis began with the impossible reparations payments imposed at the Treaty of Versailles. Hjalmar Schacht — the Rothschild agent who was currency commissioner for the Republic — opposed letting the German government print its own money. The Treaty of Versailles is a model of ingenious measures for the economic destruction of Germany. Germany could not find any way of holding its head above the water, other than by the inflationary expedient of printing bank notes?</p>

<p>Schact echoes the textbook lie that Weimar inflation was caused when the German government printed its own money. However, in his 1967 book The Magic of Money, Schact let the cat out of the bag by revealing that it was the PRIVATELY-OWNED Reichsbank, not the German government, that was pumping new currency into the economy. Thus, the PRIVATE BANK caused the Weimar hyper-inflation. Like the U.S. Federal Reserve, the Reichsbank was overseen by appointed government officials, but was operated for private gain. What drove the wartime inflation into hyperinflation was speculation by foreign investors, who sold the mark short. betting on its decreasing value. In the manipulative device known as the short sale, speculators borrow something they don&#39;t own, sell it, and then &quot;cover&quot; by buying it back at the lower price. </p>

<p>Speculation in the German mark was made possible because the PRIVATELY OWNED Reichsbank (not yet under Nazi control) made massive amounts of currency available for borrowing. This currency, like U.S. currency today, was created with accounting entries on the bank&#39;s books. Then the funny-money was lent at compound interest. When the Reichsbank could not keep up with the voracious demand for marks, other private banks were allowed to create marks out of nothing, and to lend them at interest. The result was runaway debt and inflation. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>CTND</p>

<p>Thus, according to Schacht himself, the German government did not cause the Weimar hyperinflation. On the contrary, the government (under the National Socialists) got hyperinflation under control. The National Socialists put the Reichsbank under strict government regulation, and took prompt corrective measures to eliminate foreign speculation. One of those measures was to eliminate easy access to funny-money loans from private banks. Then Hitler got Germany back on its feet by having the public government issue Treasury Certificates. </p>

<p>Schacht, the Rotchschild agent, disapproved of this government fiat money, and wound up getting fired as head of the Reichsbank when he refused to issue it. Nonetheless, he acknowledged in his later memoirs that allowing the government to issue the money it needed did not produce the price inflation predicted by classical economic theory, which says that currency must be borrowed from private cartels. </p>

<p>What causes hyper-inflation is uncontrolled speculation. When speculation is coupled with debt (owed to private banking cartels) the result is disaster. On the other hand, when a government issues currency in carefully measured ways, it causes supply and demand to increase together, leaving prices unaffected. Hence there is no inflation, no debt, no unemployment. and no need for income taxes. Naturally this terrifies the bankers. since it eliminates their powers. It also terrifies Jews, since their control of banking allows them to buy the media, the government, and everything else. <strong>Therefore, to those who delight in saying “Jews financed Hitler,” I ask that they please look at all the facts.</strong></p>

    <div class="md"><p>Poland had begun a genocide of the Germans living within their soil. You’ll hear tell from certain sources that this was a post-invasion fabrication by the Germans as a false <em>casus belli</em>, but if that was true, they couldn’t reconcile Hitler’s last (and widely-reported) <a href="http://i.imgur.com/VQfVoFI.png"><em>pre</em>-war peace offer</a>.</p>

<p>Poland, after 1933 but before the establishment of a puppet government, was allied with Nazi Germany against their common enemy, the USSR. Poland’s leadership was extremely pleased with Germany and was amiable to their requests. The term ‘lebensraum’ referred to the restoration of German soil that was taken at the end of WWI, not to ‘world conquest’ or even some of the more widely reproduced maps (which refer to wartime reorganization).

Even with their muscling out of competitors, the Nazis share of the vote shrunk because their rhetoric stopped being as interesting as it was.   Help from the U.S. was a major part of this recovery. They loved German goods and bought them up like crazy, even after the few tumultuous years following the Crash. Unfortunately, that crash hit the US hard, and thus their ability to purchase  German goods.That funny little dictator put a stop to this because Jewmerica bad. By that time, unemployment had started to fall and Red Cross soup kitchens had since closed. </p>

<p>The US liked buying German stuff so much they had reparations slashed to a fraction of their original goal just so they could keep buying German stuff. As a result, her economy boomed through the 20s. They also made available a massive amount of business loans aimed at developing the German economy.  Foreign investment flourished. The mark stabilized. God save the USA.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The Treaty of Versailles had imposed crushing reparations on the German people, </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Shoulda seen what Germany did to France and Russia a few years earlier.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>r. These costs totaled three times the value of all the property in Germany.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And her annual payments were a small fraction of her income.</p>

<p>Between around 1919 and 1932, Germany paid out 20 billion marks.</p>

<p>She received, in foreign investment alone, 27 billion in that same time period (which was never repaid). Interestingly, in 1922 among France, Germany and England- Germany had the lowest public debt. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>demanding that Germans repay every nation&#39;s costs of the war. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Actually it demanded that German <em>and all of its allies</em> pay back an amount.</p>

<p>Germany, being robust financially was the only one who could actually attempt to do so.</p>

<p>Fortunately, by 1933, because of the global depression, Germany&#39;s <em>entire</em> debt was put on hold. As in, they didn&#39;t need to pay it. And the final target was reduced by <strong>90%</strong>. They stopped paying reparations before the Nazis took power, and the world was okay with it.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Private currency speculators caused the German mark to plummet, precipitating one of the worst runaway inflations in modern times. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>German reparations weren&#39;t paid out in paper marks. So that doesn&#39;t matter.</p>

<p>But more importantly, hyperinflation was a german problem. <em>They</em> did it. <em>They</em> caused it. That was their financial mismanagement that did it. The recipients of reparations wanted them paid, they weren&#39;t encouraging Germans to print money- knowing full well the effect it would have on their ability to make said payments.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Countless homes and farms were lost to speculators and to private (Jewish controlled) banks.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Countless?  Lol. Nope.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Germans lived in hovels. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>You&#39;re thinking of Americans which the term Hoover Hovels came from.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>They were starving.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yeah that&#39;s what happens following global economic collapse.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Germany had no choice but</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Actually she had plenty of choice and readily demonstrated she wasn&#39;t interested in making those payments. And others, including the USA were more or less okay with it</p>

<blockquote>
<p>to succumb to debt slavery under international (mainly Jewish) bankers</p>
</blockquote>

<p>lol k</p>

<blockquote>
<p>until 1933</p>
</blockquote>

<p>LOL</p>

<p>So when their debt was forgiven that&#39;s... what exactly?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>World Jewry responded by declaring a global boycott against Germany.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No, they did this in response to a violent, antisemitic government specifically targeting jews. </p>

<p>Of course boycotts aren&#39;t illegal. But then again I guess technically neither is removing the pensions of long retired public servants because they&#39;re Jewish. Or refusing to let Jews use public swimming pools. Meh. Tomato tomatoe.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Hitler began a national credit program by devising a plan of public works that included flood control, repair of public buildings and private residences, and construction of new roads, bridges. canals. and port facilities.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>good thing he was given a rebounding economy to do all this with</p>

<blockquote>
<p>All these were paid for with money that no longer came from the private international bankers</p>
</blockquote>

<p>lol yeah it came from foreign investment XD. Oddly enough, it was new loans taken out in 1933 which were due up for repayment in 1939. Hey what else happened in 1939?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Under the National Socialists, Germany&#39;s money wasn&#39;t backed by gold</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And Germany, like other European countries came off the gold standard in the early 30s- <em>before</em> the Nazis rose to power.  So you&#39;re wrong here too, surprise surprise.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Within two years, the unemployment problem had been solved,  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>cut out half of your counted workforce and send the rest for military training. boom. those numbers start popping.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>with no debt,</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Which had been mostly forgiven <em>and</em> stopped payments before the Nazis took power</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Germany even managed to restore foreign trade</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Actually, that was largely an American choice. Hitler really was neither too keen on fdi, nor interested in encouraging it. Not surprisingly enough, it plummeted. Hitler couldn&#39;t buy foreign goods if he showed up himself and pleaded with the vendors. He managed to wipe out his entire savings on buying foreign goods, usually for war materiel. Hitler loved snatching up loan after loan after loan to finance his war racket.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Venezuela </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Economic powerhouse Venezuela.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Germany’s economic freedom was short-lived, but it left several monuments, including the famous Autobahn,</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Planning of which began in the 1920s.</p>

<p>Hitler however wasn&#39;t too keen on this. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>global boycott by Jewish-owned industries. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>You have no idea what this even refers to, do you?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Hjalmar Schacht, a Rothschild agent </p>
</blockquote>

<p>lol</p>

<blockquote>
<p>who was temporarily head of the German central bank,</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And wanted to steer Germany away from such unsustainable practices and building a proper economy.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>nd was rewarded by having all charges against him dropped at the Nuremberg trials</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Nah, he was &quot;rewarded&quot; for you know..not murdering anyone</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Germany was rescued from English economic theory</p>
</blockquote>

<p>They were &quot;rescued&quot; from working economic theory and plunged into piracy-dependence.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The Nazis came to power in 1933 when the German economy was in total collapse,</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Not even close to correct.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>with ruinous war-reparation obligations</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Not in 1933.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>and zero prospects for foreign investment or credit.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Not even close to correct.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>the Third Reich was able to turn a bankrupt Germany</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Not even close to correct.</p>

<p>Her colonies contributed very little.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Asia Times </p>
</blockquote>

<p>LOL</p>

<blockquote>
<p>These facts do not appear in any textbooks today, since Jews own most publishing companies. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Actually it&#39;s because they aren&#39;t fact.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>. In reality, the Weimar financial crisis began with the impossible reparations payments imposed at the Treaty of Versailles.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As show, they were quite possible.</p>

<p>Also, as shown, they didn&#39;t really need to pay them back and most people- including the USA who was one  of their largest backers, didn&#39;t really care.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Considering the Kali Yuga just very recently ended, however, I wouldn&#39;t say Hitler&#39;s death can be thought of as having any real serious bearing upon it.  I&#39;d say Ashkenazi Khazar chicanery is closer to an incarnation of &quot;the destroyer&quot; than Hitler himself ever was.</p>

<p>Additionally, the <em>real</em> destroyer isn&#39;t Vishnu.  It&#39;s Shiva.  <em>That&#39;s</em> the incarnation that brings forth real destruction.</p>

<p>Hitler wasn&#39;t as big as those behind the curtain who funded and supported him.  <em>Those</em> were the real destroyers.</p>
