<p>I wouldn&#39;t worry about nukes. Sure a couple will get detonated around the globe but it&#39;s not like it hasn&#39;t been happening already. These people want to use a weapon they haven&#39;t used since 9/11. They will roll out all their classified weapons too. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;In Hiroshima I was prepared for radically different sights. But, to my surprise, Hiroshima looked exactly like all the other burned-out cities in Japan.
There was a familiar pink blot, about two miles in diameter. It was dotted with charred trees and telephone poles. Only one of the cities twenty bridges was down. Hiroshima&#39;s clusters of modern buildings in the downtown section stood upright.</p>

<p>It was obvious that the blast could not have been so powerful as we had been led to believe. It was extensive blast rather than intensive.</p>

<p>I had heard of buildings instantly consumed by unprecedented heat. Yet here I saw the buildings structurally intact, and what is more, topped by undamaged flag poles, lightning rods, painted railings, air raid precaution signs and other comparatively fragile objects.</p>

<p>At the T-bridge, the aiming point for the atomic bomb, I looked for the &quot;bald spot&quot; where everything presumably had been vaporized in the twinkling of an eye. It wasn&#39;t there or anywhere else. I could find no traces of unusual phenomena.</p>

<p>What I did see was in substance a replica of Yokohama or Osaka, or the Tokyo suburbs - the familiar residue of an area of wood and brick houses razed by uncontrollable fire. Everywhere I saw the trunks of charred and leafless trees, burned and unburned chunks of wood. The fire had been intense enough to bend and twist steel girders and to melt glass until it ran like lava - just as in other Japanese cities.&quot;</p>

<p>I mean I have seen the <a href="http://heiwaco.tripod.com/hiroshima.jpg">pictures</a> as well. Doesn&#39;t look like a nuke went off to me. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Fission - the splitting of atoms by neutrons releasing energy and more neutrons - discovered already 1938 - works. It is only used in nuclear power plants under controlled/slow conditions using a moderator - normally water - to control the process. Energy - pure heat - is then produced (and some waste). Uncontrolled/fast fission - neutrons exponentially splitting atoms (Uranium or Plutonium pure metal) at the speed of light releasing during some nano-seconds more neutrons and enormous amounts of energy and particles in the air as an explosive FLASH - an a-bomb - creating a dirty mushroom cloud killing people - is not possible. The neutrons producing fission just fly away, disappear and do nothing else.</p>

<p>Unless you have some serious security clearance you aren&#39;t going to be able to back that up lol. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Um... the above-referenced post is quite literally conspiring to come up with a narrative. I seems like you&#39;re trying to come up with usable material against NG. I think it goes beyond &quot;hey guys, any theories as to why they&#39;re always around when shit goes down?&quot; and into &quot;let&#39;s brainstorm ways to take them down by creating a narrative.&quot; </p>

<p>I&#39;m not saying TPTB aren&#39;t doing that exact same thing to us to spin their stories, I&#39;m just saying I don&#39;t know that fighting fire with fire is something most people would be comfortable with in this instance.
