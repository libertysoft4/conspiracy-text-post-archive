        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>This is quatrain:  Century V-75 from the book &quot;Conversations with Nostradamus&quot;.</p>

<p>He will rise high over his wealth, more to the right
He will remain seated on the square stone;
Towards the south, placed at the window,
A crooked staff in his hand, his mouth sealed</p>

<p>B:  He  says  that  this  refers  to  a  man  in  the  United  States.  A  man  who  is very  wealthy.  Wealthy  to  the  point  that  anything  he  wants  done  can get  done  instantaneously,  for  he  has  the  money  to  get  it  accomplished. He  says  this  man  will  be  well  known  and  famous  because  of  his wealth,  but his  true  mission  in  life  will  be  secret,  for  this  man  will  be a  fanatic  of  sorts.  He  will  be  involved  with  such  organizations  as  the American  Nazi  Party  and  the  Ku  Klux  Klan.  That&#39;s  why  he  put  in  the phrase,  &quot;the  crooked  staff,&quot;  to  represent  the  burning  crosses  of  the  Ku Klux  Klan  and  the  swastika  of  the  Nazi  party.  This  man&#39;s  sole ambition  in  life  is  towards  the  overthrow  of  the  American  government as  it  is  presently  constituted  in  the  20oth  century.  He  says  this  man naturally  enough  will  also  be  involved  in  politics.  But  even  though  his main  ambition  is  to  change  the  form  of  the  American  government,  he has  to  stay  low-key  in  politics  so  that  he  may  continue  spinning  his webs  of  power  and  continue  making  new  contacts  and  expanding  his range  of  influence.  The  groundwork  that  he  has  laid  will  come  to fruition  at  the  time  of  the  troubles  caused  by  the  Anti-Christ. </p>

<p>D:  At  this  present time  does  anybody  know  who  he  is? 
B:  Those  who  follow  him  know  who  he  is. </p>

<p>D:  But  the  other people  don&#39;t  know  the  danger he  poses? 
B:  No,  for  he  has  been  very  sly,  very  careful. </p>

<p>D:  Would  that  explain  the  phrase,  &quot;he  will  remain  seated on  the  square stone&quot;? 
B:  Yes.  He  will  be  in  the  center  of  the  entire  organization,  but  he  won&#39;t be  the  figure  of  power  that  people  see.  He  will  have  a  puppet,  someone  who  will  appear  to  be  the  one  in  power,  but  he  will  be  pulling  the strings.  He  will  have  a  figurehead,  but  he  will  remain  seated  behind, on  the  square  stone  that  is,  in  the  center  of  this  organization. </p>

<p>D:  &quot;His  mouth  sealed&quot; would  mean  that he  is  secret. 
B:  Yes,  he  is  secret.  The  phrase,  &quot;toward  the  south  at  the  window,&quot; means  that  due  to  his  political  beliefs,  what  open  activities  he  does indulge  in  and  the  mayhem  he  likes  to  cause  is  more  often  to  appear</p>

<p>I can&#39;t think of anyone else who this could be.  Famous billionaire.  Wants to overthrow government - Obama was literally just saying the media is like the Wild West - he wouldn&#39;t have said anything unless it was a major problem.  Turner owns CNN.  Recently gave a billion dollars to the UN who is really the only present organization who can undermine the US government.  Square stone = television - prehistoric man carved rocks for communication.  South, Turner&#39;s hometown Atlanta, Georgia.  Nickname of &quot;Captain Outrageous&quot; would it really surprise anyone if he ended up having ties to the Klan/Nazis?  Crooked staff - herding - Turner owned largest herd of Buffalo in the world. Very sly, clever - uses good old boy &quot;Aww shucks&quot; attitude as cover.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I feel you,
But while I feel like I&#39;m very pro-Trump, I also like to look at things from every angle possible. His message to the public is that he wants to change the current government system. 
He managed to rise above his image of &quot;just being wealthy&quot; and became the primary republican candidate for the United States presidency. 
Clinton is the one that looks like she&#39;s in control. Like she&#39;s the one behind all the string pulling. 
What if Clinton is Trump&#39;s puppet and he&#39;s just pulling the strings with her?
I don&#39;t know. Shit just makes me paranoid. </p>

<p>Good.  Keep at it.  Make sure and preach non-racism and <em>be</em> that way as well, however.  Together we stand, divided we fall.  We must be able to support one another first before we collectively have enough courage and strength to all stand up and move against tptb.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>God your words are inspiring dude. Reading through that comment was like pulling thoughts out if my mind. I do believe divided amongst people with open eyes, and most people won&#39;t take in my words, but dammit I try.

Keep up the good work amongst this community, and any others if possible. You could seriously be looked at as the Voice of Freedom and begin a little pot stirring if you felt like it. </p>

<p>It encourages and indeed inspires me to know that there are other souls on this planet who understand some of the things I said in that comment.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Most people don’t take in my words either…but yes.  I keep trying too.  And every now and then, I run across someone…like you.  And that lets me know that not everything I say is completely lost on everyone.  And it makes it worth it to me to keep trying and keep speaking the truth as I understand it.  So I won’t stop.  And neither should you.</p>

<blockquote>

<p><em>We</em> could.  That goes for both of us - and this, as well, applies to those others (few as we might presently be) who feel this same way as well.</p>

<p>Fight hard.  Fight strong.  Fight righteously…for all of us.  For we are family (and no - not in the Sister Sledge way.  I mean it for real).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The pot needs stirring, the voice of freedom needs to be blasted through a megaphone into all the ears of the american people. There are people everywhere that feel this way, we just need to group together, we need to spur a movement and revolt against this corrupt government that is slowly gaining more control of our lives.
I&#39;m afraid of what the future holds if people continue to sit back and watch as our police turn into military and as our government tightens it&#39;s coils.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>We need to coalesce like-minded individuals together and encourage a movement of disciplined revolters - and by revolters I don&#39;t mean trigger happy rioters ready to shoot and break anything that moves.  That&#39;s horrible and counterproductive.

    <div class="md"><p>It will most definitely not be easy, however.  Heck, just today my brother in law got <em>very</em> aggressively upset when he asked me if I was going to vote, we got on the subject of the candidates involved, and I told him just how insanely corrupt Clinton is.  He literally freaked out and started yelling about how &quot;Hillary&#39;s the best choice available!&quot;</p>

<p>The fact that he likely represents a good portion of America is, again, rather disheartening where it regards the shroud of ignorance that still covers the minds of most people in this country.</p>

<p>He&#39;s otherwise quite a sane, intelligent, professional individual who I get along with well enough, but got demonstrably irate over the thought of Trump getting in office.</p>

<p>Yes.  Trump sucks balls, of course.  They both do.  Big time.  Clinton should not be in office, however.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, to be sure, these corporacrats wield a decentish amount of power on one end.</p>

<p>I think it&#39;s unfortunate that so many people seem to have their vehemence misdirected and pointed in the wrong direction - at the politicians instead of the multinational corporate money changers that <em>control</em> them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I actually had the same kind of encounter on social media with an older cousin of mine. My Facebook feed isn&#39;t necessarily pro-Trump, but it is absolutely anti-Hillary. They wouldn&#39;t even accept my evidence towards my point, as if it was an absolute lie. I don&#39;t mind having set beliefs, but at least okay with the thought before calling me delusional. </p>

<p>Exactly.  I can only worry about making sure and getting my own story straight/my own mind straight and making sure that I&#39;m not misguided, etc.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>God your words are inspiring dude. Reading through that comment was like pulling thoughts out if my mind. I do believe divided amongst people with open eyes, and most people won&#39;t take in my words, but dammit I try. I send links to friends and kind of jokingly say &quot;Here&#39;s your tinfoil ruffle of the day&quot; hoping that gets them to read it. Keep up the good work amongst this community, and any others if possible. You could seriously be looked at as the Voice of Freedom and begin a little pot stirring if you felt like it. </p>
