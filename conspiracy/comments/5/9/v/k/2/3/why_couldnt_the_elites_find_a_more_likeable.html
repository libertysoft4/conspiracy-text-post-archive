        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I think Hillary is probably one of the most despised people in the country. Sure, there are a few uncritical people who like her. But I feel that these are certainly a minority. Most of the people who vote for her &quot;hold their noses and vote for Clinton&quot; because they fear Trump so much. Lots of them even admit that Clinton is unpleasant, dishonest and corrupt, and that they are just voting for her on the basis that Trump would be so terrible.</p>

<p>The elites were seemingly much smarter in 2008. Obama was a much more charismatic puppet. Moreover, he&#39;s just as easy to control and use as a figurehead as Hillary. They just need a face on TV so that they can tell the people &quot;this person is the president, this person is responsible.&quot;</p>

<p>Why choose Hillary for this role? Why not do like in 2008? Find someone with a smile that seems authentic. And someone who they could at least <strong>try</strong> to sell as an idealist, a fresh breath of air, etc. That&#39;s what they managed to do in 2008. They actually managed to sell Obama as a person with real integrity who was going to change things. Hardly <strong>anybody</strong> believes that about Clinton. You&#39;d have to be really stupid to believe that Clinton is going to change anything for the better. Even her voters don&#39;t believe that, mostly, they just say &quot;Yes, she&#39;s pretty bad, but please just vote for her, or else Trump will be president!&quot;</p>

<p>Why would the elites push her through the primaries? Why even have her run in the first place? She has a long and extensive history of corruption and it&#39;s pretty well known. She is very unlikeable. I don&#39;t understand why the elites would even want to use her. If I was them, I would want a more likable and charismatic puppet.</p>

<p>It&#39;s true that she has a lot of experience (at being a shill), but how hard is it to be a puppet? You have to do as you&#39;re told, give speeches, lie to people, keep a straight face, have fancy dinners, shake hands with people, hold press conferences, etc. Is Hillary really the best choice the elites could find for this? IMO she does most of that rather staggeringly, if at all. She has a terrible voice, totally devoid of melody. Also, I find that she has this extreme air of inauthenticity in her whole way of being. So it makes people hate her on this whole emotional level.</p>

<p>The elites have massive resources, and a wide range of devoted shills to choose from. How in the world could they have landed on Hillary? I don&#39;t understand. </p>

<p>Next, some wild speculation. One thing that has struck me is that maybe their plan to coronate Hillary is just one more way of rubbing it in. A lot of their dealings lately are just brazenly, openly corrupt. There are a lot of things that it seems they&#39;re not even trying to hide anymore. Maybe they like it that way? The public don&#39;t seem to care that much anymore anyway. Their main response seems to be some talking, hashtags, Youtube videos and social media posts. In that sense, maybe the elites <strong>like</strong> it this way, as a way of rubbing it in? Like &quot;see, we can shove such horrible candidates down your throats and there&#39;s nothing you can do about it except for shouting at the Internet.&quot; Sort of like a dictator asserting his power, to subjugate and demoralize the population. Only without literally saying it outright. This paragraph was just some loose thoughts, I&#39;m not saying it&#39;s true or anything.</p>

<p>Finally, this is not intended as a rant. I&#39;m actually asking the question, and looking for some possible answers (speculation obviously, but anyway) from the community. This subreddit seemed like the most obvious place to ask, due to the premise of the question about the elites running the country behind the scenes and Hillary (as well as previous presidents) being one of their shills. This subreddit seems to accept that premise, therefore I determined that this would probably be the best place to ask the question. So, again, I really want to know the answer. I am trying to understand why the elites, from their perspective, could possibly think Hillary was a good choice for a puppet this year.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>They did find a more likeable puppet. His name is Trump.</p>

<p>TPTB will make sure Trump is President, to give the people the illusion that they, the people, are in control (despite obvious MSM shenanigans and FBI corruption) -- just as they did with the whole Brexit thing.</p>

<p>By making the MSM demonize Trump and make Hillary look like an angel, TPTB woke the sheeple up to the realization that the MSM is corrupt. Taking down the obviously corrupt MSM is part of the master plan of the real elite running this show. </p>

<p>The introduction of the NWO seems to have something to do with giving &quot;We the people&quot; the illusion of control, telling us that we&#39;re in charge.</p>

<p>Perhaps they give us Trump as POTUS this way, but it turns out that he&#39;s horrible. Thus, he defames the whole concept of democracy -- and the globalist-sponsored solution to democracy will be the NWO, a benevolent technocratic global dictatorship introduced in the year 2023. </p>

<p>Why chose Hillary for this role? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>IMO, it&#39;s because she&#39;s trustworthy to them, and many promises have been exchanged.  The inner circle of the power elite is small.  They know she will do what they ask, &quot;they&quot; being the Trilateral Commission, CFR, etc.</p>

<p>Clinton is on the side of the bankers, Wall street, the MIC and zionist Israel.  Those are her real backers.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I see things working as more a political game.  The rich and elite don&#39;t directly conspire together to choose a specific candidate and put them in power.  Even if they wanted to do this it would leave too much of a direct paper trail and harm their influence.  Instead, they just choose people that play by their rules and implement things close to the way the want.  They influence these people by funding them and granting then access to different arenas of society.  So they have a large pool of people that they let play the political game, and whoever comes out on top comes out on top.  That way there is illusion of choice and the world still operates the way they want.</p>

<p>I think this is a risky bet they are willing to do A) because Hillary character is congruent with someone who&#39;s going to start WW3 (so that there aren&#39;t too many questions when time comes) and B) because they want to gauge how much power they garnered so far by putting an unelectable, known corrupt lady as president.</p>

<p>They are wondering if the water is at boiling point finally... i guess.</p>

<li>She gets shit done as someone has already said, </li>

<li>Despite who she is she still is capable of fooling the sheep, potentially still a majority of American voters</li>
<li>They may want to bring in a more authoritarian regime as going softly, softly is taking too long</li>
</ul>

<p>If an Obama type started full on infringing on people&#39;s rights there&#39;d be more waking up, push back &amp; risk of failure whereas Hilary could go full Hitler, have complicit masses aiding her in her cause, secret police doing what they are told (we&#39;ve already seen that), media pushing her cause (already seen that too), laws brought in to prevent you seeing alternative information and suddenly protesting could be inconceivably dangerous, 100 times worse than now. And to top it all off, she&#39;s been proving she&#39;s untouchable, so who&#39;s going to go up against that machine once she is POTUS? </p>

<p>She might be their ugly choice, but she can win, and after that she can&#39;t lose. All the while the backers once again remain completely anonymous, because she can be blamed for absolutely everything and everyone would believe she is capable of it, all on her own. She tries to bring in NWO shit gets nuclear, she actually does get beaten by external forces, they can just point the finger at her (wasn&#39;t Hitler&#39;s trying for NWO of his own?

    <div class="md"><p>I see a lot of people commenting that they (the elite) have abandoned covert actions. This is not the case imo. I believe the apparent lack of subtlety is more a product of the general public waking up. I&#39;m pretty hard, myself, on the stupidity of our world and agree with rogan that eventually the stupid will outbreed the smart, but we aren&#39;t there yet. </p>

<p>Remember in 08 that the Democratic opposition was strongly McCain. Hilary could not have won against such a likable war hero, no chance, so the Dems went for the black vote. This did a lot for their political game and Obama was an obedient subject for his terms. It was well played.</p>

<p>After the smart people became more and more aware and the stupid learned how to internet, some of those fluoridated idiots woke up. </p>

<p>You see, the elite have never been great at hiding things, but the stupid are easy to distract and a smart person won&#39;t pursue truth if they&#39;re outnumbered by idiots who are too distracted to think. Imagine you&#39;re in high school and you catch the most popular guy cheating on a test. You confront him publicly, but he weaves an argument not based on facts, but based on your unpopularity. You&#39;d most likely concede since you can actually figure out that further protest will make you a pariah.</p>

<p>The same happens in politics, but instead of becoming a pariah, those who blow whistles become martyrs. </p>
