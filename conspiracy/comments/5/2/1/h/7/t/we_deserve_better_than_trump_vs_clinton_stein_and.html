<p>Putting down every single racial division that&#39;s been indoctrinated and brainwashed into us, come together as the one, united people that we indeed all are, and support one another as we all move together <em>against</em> this corrupt, draconian system.

<p>WHAT? Are you losing it? Do you realize the <em>only</em> reason you have the right to say a statement like that is thanks to politics. We wouldn&#39;t have any of the fantastic luxuries we do here in America today if it weren&#39;t for politics. If people couldn&#39;t debate, if people couldn&#39;t vote, if we couldn&#39;t get our ideas through to the government, our government would never be, and would never have been for the people. The idea in itself that anyone thinks this is an absolute disgrace. What, just don&#39;t vote? Don&#39;t pay attention to policies going through? Politics is an absolutely ESSENTIAL component of a functioning and healthy society.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Everyone who votes, regardless of the candidate is engaging in force against their neighbors. </p>

<p>No. This is not how this works. No, no, no, no. You&#39;re saying that if you vote for someone, you&#39;re directly working against everyone else around you&#39;s interests? No. You vote for your interests, and your interests coincide with the majority of the populous if you win. Get over yourself, you&#39;re not better or smarter than everyone around you who cares about what happens in this country because you don&#39;t agree with their political views, and they sure as hell aren&#39;t working against you, they are just working for themselves, and those who win are the <strong>majority</strong> for a reason.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Stop feeding the beast.</p>

<p>What beast? The one that decides that you can own your own land? The one that decides the way the whole economy works in this country? The one that allows you to start your own business, have a voice in important decisions, make your own money, your own wage and work almost any job you want? (if you work for it and have a little luck, of course) You should be happy to be a part of this &quot;&quot;&quot;beast&quot;&quot;&quot; and be happy that you can feed it instead of it eating you.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>

<p>I would like to change this statement slightly. I would say that an educated (not indoctrinated), critically thinking, and responsible <em>citizen</em> is what is absolutely essential to the functioning of a <strong>healthy</strong> society.  Especially where the system allows for the choosing of its leaders by the citizenry.</p>

<p>Remember: it wasn&#39;t the system of government that founded and provides the rights we all enjoy in the US, but instead it was <em>people</em> who created a system that allows for and upholds those rights. These same individuals speak at length on how important it is to have an educated, free-thinking citizens and he dangers of not having them (which we currently see unfolding).</p>

<p>No <em>one</em> candidate will change things for the better. If I were to suggest <em>one</em> thing that could make our government better (by which I mean more representative of its people than its business interests) it would be the removal, abolition, and banning of all <em>professional</em> politicians. That would be a good start, but certainly not the <em>only</em> solution.  As long as money can buy politicians, we (as citizens) will never have representation.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is a very rational argument. The problem is distinguishing well educated voters from the opposite, mostly because &quot;education&quot; in politics is very subjective, is that who is properly &quot;educated&quot; is basically who agrees with you. Of course there are people who have no idea how anything works and support someone, but generally this group is much smaller, I think. I agree with the point about career politicians for the most part, which is another reason I support Trump.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Education shouldn&#39;t be tied to politics, the subjective aspect is illusory and is only a method by which people can be further divided. <strong>All</strong> people should be properly educated in all things (not just politics) so that they better understand and can communicate their position and make <strong>informed</strong> choices.</p>

<p>I respect your choice to support whomever you choose, but two things I feel I must point out; First, no single politician will change things for the better. Stien won&#39;t change things. Trump won&#39;t change things. Hillary won&#39;t change things. Obama didn&#39;t change things. And more to the point, not <strong>one</strong> candidate truly represents their constituency (unless you consider their constituency to be business interests). You would be better off voting &quot;no confidence&quot; (or as I like to put it, &quot;none of you bastards&quot;) than casting a vote for <em>any</em> candidate. Second, <strong>every</strong> politician we see on the national stage is bought and paid for. No exceptions.</p>

<p>You may be asking, &quot;well, if that is the case, then what can I do?&quot; Easy, start by letting your &quot;representatives&quot; know that you no longer have faith that they accurately represent your views and concerns nor the concerns of their constituency. Don&#39;t vote for a person in <strong>any</strong> up coming election. Vote &quot;Odin&quot; or &quot;Ficcus&quot;, or &quot;none of you bastards&quot;, basically communicate through your vote your lack of confidence in your government.  I firmly believe that nothing short of flushing the government of <strong>all</strong> its politicians or straight up starting a new government, will change or address any of the issues and concerns we currently have.</p>

<p>Thank you for taking the time to discuss this with me and please know that, while I do not share your position, I fully respect your right to have one. If I have inadvertently insulted you, my apologies. It was never my intent.   </p>

<p>The brainwashing is strong in you. A right is not given, if it&#39;s given it&#39;s a privilege or concession. Politics didn&#39;t afford any awesome technology and distractions of tech, private companies did while &quot;government&quot; took a cut for imposing restrictions on them. Politics is no way by any stretch of the imagination essential in a healthy society. Informed people willing to stand up for themselves is essential. I have the right to say what I want because I was born able to learn language and use it to communicate. Everyone on the planet has a right to say what they want, only the consequences are different.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>That&#39;s not how you&#39;d like to think it works but it&#39;s the truth. You as an individual or part of a group have no right to restrict another individual or groups freedoms. Yeah you vote for your interest but they don&#39;t coincide with any majority interest, try to educate yourself on voter participation rates. Also marijuana laws Shit on your poor attempt at an argument. Majority of 9% is still an overall minority, but yeah keep believing mob rule isn&#39;t somehow forceful and violent.</p>

<p>You&#39;re wrong. And your response is so out of its mind ignorant that I had to reply back. A majority of people do think like this they just don&#39;t realize it. You&#39;re a brainwashed fool and you allow yourself to be exploited because you think it&#39;s in your favor to be a slave. Good luck with that.</p>
