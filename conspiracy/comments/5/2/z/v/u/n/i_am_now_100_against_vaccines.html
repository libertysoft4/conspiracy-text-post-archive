<p>I agree there are some vaccines that should be shelved permanently. But if I had a kid he/she would most definitely be getting Smallpox/MMR/HepA/DTaP/Polio/Meningococcal, and be on a high vitamin C/cilantro diet for a few years after.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I am not. Those developing countries do not have clean water and indoor plumbing for their populations. Combined with malnutrition, the lack of sanitation provided by clean water and indoor plumbing  is the biggest cause of disease in those countries, not lack of vaccinations. The decline in serious diseases in the US is positively correlated with the widespread use of clean water and indoor plumbing, and the diseases were already near nonexistent before mass vaccinations for things like measles ever started. So there is no evidence vaccines eradicated these diseases.</p>

<p>You do realize how common measles was? And it was totally normal. Children got it and would stay home and watch tv and play games. It was alike a free day with alittle rash involved!!!! </p>

<p>Measles</p>

<p>Complications occur in about 30% and may include diarrhea, blindness, inflammation of the brain, and pneumonia among others.</p>

<p><strong>Yea real tame. There is a reason people developed a measles vaccine.</strong></p>

<p>I&#39;m sorry your grandmother developed Polio, but the drastic drop in polio is directly caused from the polio vaccine.</p>

<p>Why do you think I said to increase Vitamin C? It blocks the harmful effects of heavy metals and mercury, and chelates it out of the body.</p>

<p>If you don&#39;t know WTF you are talking about then please keep your dangerous opinions to yourself lest someone actually listen to your advice and have their kids become dangerously sick.</p>

<p>I was in the Navy and operated in 3 different regions, and have had just about every vaccination known to man. Trust me when I say the risks are very, very overstated.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In the U.S., Thiomersal has been removed from or reduced to trace amounts in all vaccines routinely recommended for children 6 years of age and younger with the exception of inactivated influenza vaccine. Vaccines with trace amounts of thiomersal contain 1 microgram(µg) or less of mercury per dose.</p>

<p>(US EPA) has estimated a <strong>safe daily intake</strong> level of 0.1 µg/kg body weight per day.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>IOW the mercury risks from vaccines in children with healthy diets is negligible.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes. If you understood chemistry you would know sodium is explosive with moisture and chlorine is poisonous. Yet when elements react or are in different compounds they aren&#39;t harmful anymore. Am I really explaining this to an adult? And if you think the smallpox eradication wasn&#39;t due to vaccines I would love to know why they only brought vaccinations to India  (which still has poor sanitation) and eradicated it there? The disease was suppressed via ring vaccinations, they vaccinated around heavily infected areas and closed in on it. Maps by government and nonprofit organizations show it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Apple seeds have cyanide. People eat apple seeds all the time. Maybe cyanide isn&#39;t bad for you then. Hell, just inject it in your body, why not, it is done thimerisol (Mercury). i don&#39;t know about the study you are referring to, but I do know Bill and Melinda Gates vaccine programs in India paralyzed 50 thousand children there, which I assume all died since neither India or their families would be able to care for them. btw Bill Gates said on Ted that vaccines were intended to reduce populations, and lo and behold, that&#39;s exactly what he did. He is a mass murderer and in a just society would be hanged by the neck until dead for killing all those children.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m actually pretty impressed you grasped my argument and then immediately lost it. It&#39;s safe eat cyanide in apples because it&#39;s not pure cyanide, it&#39;s bonded in a form that&#39;s not dangerous. Guess how the mercury in vaccines are? And your argument doesn&#39;t make Sense, case studies on children with mercury poisoning don&#39;t have instances of autism.

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m sorry but if you really think a child can be born perfectly healthy, hitting all milestones, walking, even speaking words and one day just randomly stop all that and be labeled autistic and think it&#39;s genetic you&#39;re so brainwashed. Yes children can be born with mental disabilities but you&#39;ll notice when they&#39;re slow and not learning things. You&#39;ll notice if they are behind in hitting milestones.
But when a child is progressing perfectly until a round of shots, it&#39;s pretty fucking clear what happened. </p>

<p>Also, SIDS is a cover up for vaccine-induced death. 
Research is your friend. 
Vaccines aren&#39;t :)

Seriously what makes you think injecting that crap into our bodies helps? 
Especially such small humans who haven&#39;t even fully developed yet!!
They haven&#39;t even done any studies on vaccines during pregnancy but push it on pregnant women and try to scare them into it causing women to actually have miscarriages... 
My step-sister was 36 weeks pregnant and accepted vaccines from the doctor. 
Next time she went in her little babies heart was no longer beating.
She had to give birth to an almost full term DEAD baby. doctors don&#39;t know why the baby died.

Also, I&#39;ll gladly point you in the direction of my friend Natalie, who&#39;s son is severely autistic due to the MMR vaccine. She a huge vaccine advocate now and was once pro vaccine. And she spends a lot of time trying to educate other parents.
No one believe it until it actually happens to them.</p>

<p>While your at it. Research the MMR vaccine fraud. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Your one child is not enough to prove your hypothesis that vaccinations are bad for you. </p>

<p>What are your sources that doctors are taught bullcrap? I&#39;m from the UK, where there&#39;s a 95% vaccination rate. The top 5 healthiest countries in the world (Iceland, Sweden, Finland, Germany and Switzerland) all also have similar rates of vaccination. So its hardly like vaccination ultimately makes people sickly, as you suggest. In fact, all the data shows the exact opposite. 
There are plenty of sources showing examples where ignorant parents have believed the vaccine -&gt; autism link, which has resulted in their children&#39;s death. Here&#39;s just a few of countless thousands of articles which discredit the anti-vac movement:</p>

<p>Don&#39;t believe the work of a universally discredited doctor. Do YOUR research, for the sake of your kid.</p>

<p>Doesn&#39;t take a rocket scientist to notice your totally normal, healthy child regressing after a round of shots. It doesn&#39;t take one round either.. Keep taking them in every month for a round and soon they&#39;re either dead or mental. It&#39;s called the slow kill. No not every child gets diagnosed autism. Not every child has bad effects from vaccines. But I can promise you if you sit back and observe, you&#39;ll notice how much more sickly vaccinated kids are compared to unvaccinated </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I thin you&#39;re looking at this the wrong way.  Ok so the kid might not turn out how the father might have planned but there was a good chance he would grow to become a cog.  No offense.  </p>

<p>My take.  You got a test baby.  Document data, and try stuff.  Give the kid some marijuana when he turns maybe three.  Maybe now.  See if you can turn this baby into a genius.</p>

<p>Tl;Dr<br/>
If the baby is damaged really bad, consider going all in.  Try turning it into a genus or break it.  40 years with a poop smearing kid is a life sentence.  Darwinism, start over with an adopted kid.  You have a golden ticket for child experimentation.  Maybe flood in vitamin C.  My friend beat his sickle cell by flooding himself with Vitamin C.  </p>
