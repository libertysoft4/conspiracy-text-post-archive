<p>Ahmad Umar Sheikh  wrote the check that paid the hijackers. He worked for Mahmoud Ahmad. The check was traced through the infamous BCCI bank in Florida (?)  to Mexico and then on to the hijackers. Saudi Arabia had nothing to do with any of this.</p>

<p>Bob Graham and the Missing 9/11 Report Pages</p>

<p><a href="https://digwithin.net/2015/05/12/bob-graham/">https://digwithin.net/2015/05/12/bob-graham/</a></p>

<p>Associated Press item dated May 30, 2002.</p>

<p>&quot;The morning of Sept. 11, Sen. Bob Graham and Rep. Porter Goss were
doing what the two intelligence committee chairmen frequently do -
having breakfast together at the Capitol. With them was then-Pakistani
intelligence chief [Mahmud Ahmad]. [General Ahmad&#39;s] task was to
persuade Afghanistan&#39;s Taliban leaders to hand over terror suspect
Osama bin Laden. As the three men talked over the knotty problem, an
aide handed Goss a note saying an airplane had hit the World Trade
Center. A few moments later the Capitol would be evacuated, and the
following month [General Ahmad] was fired.&quot; </p>

<p>However, the Times also revealed that on September 11 -- while the attacks were in progress -- the two current Co-Chairmen of the Joint-Intelligence Committee investigating the 9/11 attacks, Senator Bob Graham (D-FL) and Representative Porter Goss (R-FL), met for breakfast with the ISI Chief who had ordered $100,000 wired from Pakistan to terrorist leader Mohammed Atta in the days immediately preceeding the attacks.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.rense.com/general28/linked.htm">http://www.rense.com/general28/linked.htm</a></p>

<p>According to the FBI, Indian Intelligence and several press reports, the ISI Head was instrumental in providing financial support to the 9/11 terrorists. General Mahmoud Ahmad had allegedly ordered the transfer of $100.000 to the presumed 9/11 ring-leader Mohamed Atta. </p>

<p>How fitting that this is the same House Intelligence chairman Porter Goss who was having breakfast in D.C. on 9/11 with Pakistan&#39;s security chief, Lieutenant General Mahmoud Ahmad—who was later revealed to be hijacker Mohammed Atta&#39;s bagman. </p>

<p><a href="http://blogs.villagevoice.com/pressclips/2004/08/food_for_though.php">http://blogs.villagevoice.com/pressclips/2004/08/food_for_though.php</a></p>

<p>A Times of India (10-12-2001) story by Manoj Joshi revealed that Pakistani ISA Director-General Lt. General Mahmud Ahmad sought retirement after the U.S. attacks -- confirmed by top sources in India, because of evidence produced by India showing his links to Mohammed Atta, the terrorist hijacking leader.</p>

<p>The Times said that &quot;U.S. authorities sought his [Ahmad&#39;s] removal after confirming the fact that $100,000 was wired to WTC hijacker Mohammed Atta from Pakistan by Ahmad Umar Sheikh on the instructions of ISI Lt. General Ahmad.&quot; Senior [U.S.] government sources &quot;have confirmed that India contributed significantly to establishing the link between the money transfer and the role played by the dismissed ISI chief.&quot;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Presidential candidate Senator Joe Biden admitted meeting with the chief financier of the 9/11 hijackers in the days after September 11 after being confronted by We Are Change founder Luke Rudkowski in the press room following Sunday&#39;s Democratic debate in New Hampshire.</p>

<p>According to the FBI and as confirmed by various news reports at the time, Pakistani ISI General Mahmoud Ahmad instructed Omar Saeed Sheikh, the alleged assassin of Daniel Pearl, to wire $100,000 to alleged lead hijacker Mohammed Atta in the summer of 2001.</p>

<p>Arriving exactly one week before 9/11, the general met with Pentagon, White House National Security Council and CIA officials, including George Tenet and Marc Grossman, then U.S. Under Secretary of State for Political Affairs.</p>

<p>On the very morning of 9/11, Ahmad was at a breakfast meeting on Capitol Hill hosted by Senator Bob Graham and Rep. Porter Goss, the chairmen of the Senate and House Intelligence committees.</p>

<p>Two days after the attack on the twin towers and the Pentagon, on September 13th, Senator Joseph Biden, Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, met with the ISI chief.</p>

<p>No adequate explanation has been forthcoming as to why top government and intelligence officials were meeting with the money man behind the alleged hijackers before and after 9/11.</p>

<p>Shortly after the Democratic debate had finished on Sunday, Prison Planet reporter Rudkowski was able to get access to the CNN spin room and confront presidential candidate Biden about his 9/11 meeting with the Pakistani General.</p>

<p>We asked him the question - what was he doing with the head of the Pakistani ISI General Mahmoud Ahmad, said Rudkowski, he told me - he admitted that he met with him - he met with the head of the Pakistani ISI.</p>

<p>He said I told them not to do it, I told them not to wire the money - I told them to stop supporting the Taliban, which shows he had foreknowledge of them supporting him.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I told him - sir, he funded the hijackers, you did business with him, you let him go - he&#39;s free,&quot; said Rudkowski, to which Biden responded, &quot;Get a life kid,&quot; after which Rudkowski was pushed away by Biden&#39;s security staff.</p>

<p>On the morning 11 September, 2001, Goss and Graham were having breakfast with General Ahmad.[9][10] Ahmad&#39;s network had ties to Osama bin Laden and directly funded, supported, and trained the Taliban[11].</p>

<p>Was it an ‘intelligence failure’ to give red carpet treatment to the ‘money man’ behind the 9-11 terrorists, or was it simply ‘routine’?</p>
