        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Just throwing out some ideas, sorry if it&#39;s not as succinct as it could be. </p>

<p>I mean, it may not be obvious to some, but it&#39;s clear why the world is the way it is. Money. Money results in power, power breeds greed, and greed breeds more greed and the hunger for more power. It&#39;s a never ending cycle. There is a finite amount of money on this planet (regardless of how much we continue to create), and as most are aware the majority of that wealth lays in the hands of just a few families. Money as a currency makes sense, but the current distribution of wealth has gone FAR beyond &quot;fair&quot; and is only getting worse by the day. We need to impose wealth ceilings for individuals. At some point, people reach a wealth that there is literally no reason that a person would ever need another cent. Kind of makes you think that the elite actually view the world as a real game of Risk. </p>

<p>I&#39;m not sure how, but it needs to be done. I believe that has been the answer staring us in the face all along, and we need to start to speak out. We need to demand it, as you can be sure the elite do not care about &quot;fair&quot; practices, and will stop at nothing unless we stand up and try to stop them ourselves. We have the numbers, never forget. </p>

<p>Just some ideas. What do you think? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Cool talk.  I have a good feel for why the irrational individualist has come to believe the way they do.  It is a pathetic self-righteous worldview ignorant to realities of human life on this planet.  When you shit for brains people try to chime in on topics like OP suggested, it is at the forefront of what&#39;s problematic.  You have no ability to think critically on this subject, but feel the need to chime in.  It is fucking embarrassing.  </p>
