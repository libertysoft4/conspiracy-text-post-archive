        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Can anyone give me any tips?</p>

<p>It&#39;s like I have become obsessed with this beast system lately.</p>

<p>It&#39;s become all consuming once I realized it. All I seem to do is want more knowledge of ancient history and esoteric teachings.</p>

<p>But the reality is I need to reinsert myself back into the system to survive.</p>

<p>I got laid off a two months ago so I guess having more time on my hands allowed me to slow down and make some realizations I have never done before. I also stopped drinking alcohol and using drugs. I think this also cleared a path to recognizing the beast system.</p>

<p>It&#39;s amazing, I realized I try to bring it up to people because I think it&#39;s interesting, like the Google Play store icon and the Seal of Satan being identical. They look at me like it&#39;s crazy what I&#39;m telling them.</p>

<p>Then they will say something like, &quot;well why would Google be satanic?&quot;. I don&#39;t really have a good answer for that.</p>

<p>So to sum up my post::</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Advice on reinserting myself into the matrix, finding a job in the federal beast matrix and not dwelling on shit I can&#39;t control.</p></li>
<li><p>Advice on what to say when asked why these companies would be satanic.</p></li>
</ol>

    <div class="md"><p>Its alright. Just, ok so you cant control anything. Like you dont control anything. Control... Thats not really how life works man. Like, ok. You want to escape the worry or mind or idea. Basically you have to be free from it. Honestly, there is no escaping it and the more you look, its there. Its just apart of this world. So, ive been living in it. We all live in it. And honestly, you dont tell anyone. Its not for them to know. If they wanted to know, they can sure as hell find it. No euphemism intended. Basically your fear wont end. Wanna get over and through it? You know the idea &quot;my daddy is bigger than your daddy&quot;? Find that. They consume the world, but they dont run it. No one runs it, but there is One with authority over all of it. You just need to find your daddy. </p>

<p>Edit: im not living blissfully ignorant, or pretending it doesnt affect me, but honestly, i roll with whatever the &quot;beast&quot; throws out. Its more along the lines of, unless im told to do otherwise, all i need to do is listen and take care of my responsibilities. Focus on my duties, just live. As well, if you want to be free, you arent going to live unless you know how to die. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Why would they be satanic?  Two words for you.  MONEY bro.  The love of money is the root of all evil, and this is satan&#39;s world we just visit.  Connect the dots.</p>

<p>And if you want to reinsert yourself in society, it&#39;s easy.  Just don&#39;t talk about this stuff with people or they will think you&#39;re crazy.  If they&#39;re interested in this kind of thing they will go online and find it here alright?  You&#39;ll see.  It&#39;s an uphill battle that you&#39;ll never win trying to tell people about this shit.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Don&#39;t look back, the key is to keep going down the rabbit hole. The first thing that many people encounter during their awakening is the evil conspiracy and satanism. The problem is that many people stop there when in fact there is so much more to learn. They get trapped and depressed. As you push through, you&#39;ll start caring less and less about the daily conspiracies. They are still interesting to follow, but they will no longer effect you emotionally.</p>

<p>The challenging part of the journey is to make the next leap of faith in belief. The next step is really crazy, but if you stick with it everything will eventually make sense. Remember, if you believe satanism and evil are real... don&#39;t forget that it also means that love, good and peace are real.</p>

<p>Watch Thrive - it&#39;s a good gateway
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lEV5AFFcZ-s">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lEV5AFFcZ-s</a></p>

<p>Watch Sirius by Steve Greer
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5C_-HLD21hA">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5C_-HLD21hA</a></p>

<p>and everthing in his channel
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TqG8Q8q8pCg&amp;amp;list=PLZpT2CX97ZILq9L3qsyP0hdG4EOt9ltGo">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TqG8Q8q8pCg&amp;amp;list=PLZpT2CX97ZILq9L3qsyP0hdG4EOt9ltGo</a></p>

<p>My recommendation is to check out David Wilcock&#39;s books. Start with Source Field Investigations, Synchronicity Key and then his latest book The Ascension Mysteries. I prefer the audio books. (note you can skip the books and watch Gaia, detailed below - I listened to the books after exhausting everything on Gaia)</p>

<p>I&#39;d recommend a subscription to Gaia.com, it&#39;s like a Netflix for out there stuff. I think they have a promotion where you can get your first month for $0.99 so it really doesn&#39;t cost much to check it out.</p>

<p>Learn about sacred geometries and the suppressed sciences
Watch Black Whole
<a href="http://www.gaia.com/video/black-whole">http://www.gaia.com/video/black-whole</a></p>

<p>The shows I recommend are:
Wisdom Teachings - It&#39;s David&#39;s show and it covers a lot of what&#39;s in his books.
<a href="http://www.gaia.com/show/wisdom-teachings-david-wilcock">http://www.gaia.com/show/wisdom-teachings-david-wilcock</a></p>

<p>Learn about the secret space programs
<a href="http://www.gaia.com/show/deep-space">http://www.gaia.com/show/deep-space</a></p>

<p>Eventually watch all of Corey Goodes stuff in Cosmic Disclosure (Another leap of faith that will pay off)
<a href="http://www.gaia.com/show/cosmic-disclosure">http://www.gaia.com/show/cosmic-disclosure</a></p>

<p>End result of all of this is that you&#39;ll learn that we live in exciting times and that there is nothing to fear. You will also learn that World War 3 is currently being fought behind the scenes by the forces of good against the satanists. You&#39;ll be able to see it play out in the headlines. </p>

<p>Also from all this research, you will also likely learn what your purpose in life is.</p>

<p>Anyway, I hope this helps you. Keep an open mind, it&#39;s gotten you this far ;)

    <div class="md"><p>Yes. The government, the UN... They are all satanists. They control everything. Sports, media, governments.</p>

<p>Once you awake to it, know the numerology and symbolism you see it everywhere.</p>

<p>33 and 666 and the pyramid symbolism.</p>

<p>A lot of it is in hand signals.</p>

<p>Shit I was watching a boxing match the other day. I&#39;m thinking I was safe from the beast system. The one announcer goes &quot;this boxer is coming out like a 2008 corvette, a 2008 model.&quot; Then the other a few seconds later says &quot;he needs to come out like 2016 model, yea 2016.&quot;</p>

<p>Since I.been studying numerology I did the count up. 6666.  8-2=6 twice. 2+1+2+1 = 6 plus the two leftover 6s.</p>

<p>Them referring to the boxer as different car models was so weird and out of place but I realized why they did it now that I recognize the beast system.</p>

<p>If you want a good primer to the system, start with this video:</p>

<p><a href="https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=mCxMDZj1-Vs">https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=mCxMDZj1-Vs</a></p>

<p>Then check out all those dudes videos. </p>

<p>Just a warning, it&#39;s quite jarring leaving the matrix and you see the world quite differently. You realize that you were completely indoctrinated since birth to view satanic messages your whole life, from cartoons to movies to news.</p>

<p>Shit, Donald Trump every speech throws up the 666 hand signal at least 100 times.</p>

<p>Hillary does the devil horns.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Blissfully ignorant to Lucifer being pushed so actively on the public.</p>

<p>A real world situation would be people getting away from smoking cigarettes and vaping.</p>

<p>A &quot;new study&quot; comes out showing vaping is more dangerous than cigarettes.</p>

<p>Right off the bat, if your disconnected from the Matrix you know the scientific community is owned by the beast system. You know the &quot;new study&quot; is bullshit and they are trying to get people back on the cancer sticks.</p>

<p>Shit like that.</p>

<p>I liked when I thought that we were up in space. I liked the idea of a space probe flying into intergalactic space. Now I know they are just deceiving and it depresses me.</p>

<p>Same with wars... It makes sense now, non stop war.</p>

<p>Why do space agencies fake space?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree.. I have been reading and looking into thing about the sky/moon holograms and stuff like that. Some guy on YouTube takes close up pictures of the moon all night  and on the footage there are things going to the moon and leaving. During eclipses he records too. I don&#39;t know if He is legit but idk why someone would lie about that stuff. Pretty sure he believes there is a hologram over the moon so we can&#39;t see what is going on on it..

<p>Something is going on up there.</p>

<p>The moon was out today while the sun was still out yet it was a half moon. It makes no sense what they tell us.</p>

<p>I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if the moon and sun are nothing like what we are taught.</p>

<p>The moon could he a hologram and the sun could be a heat lamp.</p>

<p>Edit: our psychopathic overlords are definitely involved in pedo shit (abuse and worse) too no? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>They best thing I&#39;ve found is writing about it and doing research, learning how to critically think and process.  Webbrain helps give your research perspective.  I don&#39;t think its satanists but rather alchemists ... Those who use and abuse the Hegelian dialectic because they think the ends justify then means, which gives them a sense of aristocratic entitlement caused by a love of secrecy and the elitism it fosters.</p>

<p>So really this is not about Satan, but about technocracy.  They&#39;ve built a kind of technocratic cybernetic country club and you&#39;re not allowed.  Club members get to play tennis (politics) and luxury meals for free (fundraiser speaking fees, corporate gains from lobbying that exceed the input), and exclusive privilege in other country clubs in-network (control of media TV and film to create a culture that loves the darker myths of capitalism)</p>

<p>So basically its a fifth column coup d&#39;etat of intelligence subverts that did 911 and initiated cog and created this neoliberal agape feast for the one tenth of percent</p>

<p>How to reinsert yourself back into the matrix once you awake to the beast system?</p>

<p>You&#39;re a traitor and will fall with the rest of them if you do this.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I realized I try to bring it up to people because I think it&#39;s interesting, like the Google Play store icon and the Seal of Satan being identical. They look at me like it&#39;s crazy what I&#39;m telling them.</p>

<p>You&#39;re going about it the wrong way.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Then they will say something like, &quot;well why would Google be satanic?&quot;. I don&#39;t really have a good answer for that.</p>

<p>Created, owned, and operated by jews. Actively working with Israel on most of its projects. Then you whip out Jesus&#39; quotes and Revelations about the matter and boom.</p>
