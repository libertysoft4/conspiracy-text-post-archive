    <div class="md"><p>Trump is being bribed by Putin.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>July 8, 2016 - Trump <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/politics/articles/2016-03-30/trump-russia-adviser-carter-page-interview">associate Carter Page</a> visits Moscow and receives an <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/carter-page-trump-russia-igor-sechin-dossier-2017-1">offer of equity from Russia in a massive Russian oil deal if Trump will lift US/EU sanctions.</a> These sanctions have <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/timdaiss/2016/08/19/prolonged-sanctions-rip-into-russia-causing-angst-for-putin/#2497241c4c2f">crippled the Russian economy and hamstrung their oligarchy.</a></p></li>
<li><p>July 18, 2016 - Trump&#39;s team makes one tweak to the RNC platform: <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/global-opinions/trump-campaign-guts-gops-anti-russia-stance-on-ukraine/2016/07/18/98adb3b0-4cf3-11e6-a7d8-13d06b37f256_story.html?utm_term=.bb24cd53f46b">a pro-Russia softening of our stance on their invasion of Ukraine/Crimea.</a></p></li>
<li><p>July 22, 2016 - Wikileaks dumps the DNC emails on the eve of the Democratic National Convention, helping hold down Clinton&#39;s favorability<a href="https://thenypost.files.wordpress.com/2016/07/nypost_20160726_brxp-1_001.jpg?quality=90&amp;amp;strip=all&amp;amp;strip=all"> among an incensed left</a> and <a href="https://www.digitalshadows.com/blog-and-research/rocking-the-vote-the-effects-of-cyber-activity-on-the-u-s-election/">boosting Trump&#39;s RNC bump</a> while holding Clinton to her lowest polling of the cycle.</p></li>
<li><p>July 27, 2016 - Trump tells the press that <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/news/archive/2016/07/trump-crimea/493280/">he would consider lifting sanctions on Russia and &quot;jokingly&quot; instructs Russia to continue to hack Clinton &quot;if they&#39;re listening.&quot;</a> It would be his last press conference of the election.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Now, of course, we know that:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>The hacking <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/obama-orders-review-of-russian-hacking-during-presidential-campaign/2016/12/09/31d6b300-be2a-11e6-94ac-3d324840106c_story.html?utm_term=.2431a5e9ccd1">was directed by Russia to help Trump win the election</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>Wikileaks <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/27/us/politics/assange-timed-wikileaks-release-of-democratic-emails-to-harm-hillary-clinton.html">timed their dumps to hurt Clinton&#39;s campaign.</a></p></li>
</ul>

<p>What has the Trump team been up to since then?</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Trump advisor <a href="http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2016/09/the-mystery-of-trumps-man-in-moscow-214283">Carter Page is under investigation for his ties to Russia.</a> He&#39;s <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/08/world/europe/carter-page-donald-trump-moscow-russia.html">continued to visit Moscow</a> in spite of that investigation.</p></li>
<li><p>The man who most likely offered Page the deal to offer to Trump was found <a href="https://cgrozev.wordpress.com/2017/01/14/tower-of-cards-part-1/">dead from gun shot wounds in the back of his car in Moscow in December.</a> The Russian state press has called his death a heart attack since the initial report (...in the back of his car, in an alley).</p></li>
<li><p>Trump advisor <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/15/us/politics/paul-manafort-ukraine-donald-trump.html">Paul Manafort, who left his official role as campaign chair last summer, is under investigation for his ties to Russia.</a> Manaffort reemerged after the election <a href="http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2016/11/30/torture-lobbyist-paul-manafort-still-advising-donald-trump-on-cabinet-picks.html">to advise Trump on cabinet positions...</a></p></li>
<li><p>Rex Tillerson, former Exxon CEO, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/09/us/politics/rex-tillerson-secretary-of-state-exxon-donald-trump.html">emerged as a dark horse candidate for Secretary of State shortly thereafter.</a> Tillerson has extensive <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/kenrapoza/2016/12/15/trump-russia-exxon-tillerson/#662ae3e63a63">business ties to Russian oil and lobbied for a reduction in sanctions while at Exxon.</a> He has deep ties to the company that <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/dec/18/leak-rex-tillerson-director-bahamas-based-us-russian-oil-company">offered Carter Page the equity deal, along with his own $200M stock in Exxon that would benefit significantly from the lifting of sanctions, and has been awarded the Friend of Russia honor by Putin.</a></p></li>
<li><p>Former military intelligence officer, and Trump&#39;s National Security Advisor, Gen. Michael Flynn <a href="http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2017/01/24/Why-We-ll-Never-Know-What-We-Need-About-Trump-s-Most-Important-Adviser-Michael-Flynn">is under investigation for his communications with Russia following a December increase in sanctions by Pres. Obama.</a> The Trump team have defended those calls with <a href="http://www.newsweek.com/trump-must-come-cleanflynn-secret-russian-calls-547583">various conflicting explanations.</a> After getting kicked out of the Obama DIA for his insubordination and islamaphobia, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/nearly-the-entire-national-security-establishment-has-rejected-trumpexcept-for-this-man/2016/08/15/d5072d96-5e4b-11e6-8e45-477372e89d78_story.html?utm_term=.7bd3442c0278">Flynn - the veteran intelligence office, cozied up to Putin.</a></p></li>
<li><p>Finally there is Trump advisor Roger Stone - a former <a href="http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,960803,00.html">business partner to Paul Manafort</a> who cut his teeth in politics as one of <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/lifestyle/1986/06/16/the-rise-and-gall-of-roger-stone/d8ce308b-7055-4666-860e-378833f46e17/?utm_term=.777ef7daf4dc">Nixon&#39;s  dirty trixsters.</a> Stone outed himself as a back-channel communicator <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/nov/02/trump-adviser-clinton-emails-wikileaks-roger-stone">between Wikileaks&#39;s Assagne and the Trump campaign</a> back in November. In his spare time before the election, Stone <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/20/citizens-for-donald-trump-exit-poll-roger-stone-rigged-election-claim">led the charge to cement the election as rigged in case of a Clinton victory.</a> He is also <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/19/us/politics/trump-russia-associates-investigation.html">under investigation by US intelligence</a>.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>During the campaign many described <a href="https://www.pri.org/stories/2016-12-16/former-cia-chief-calls-trump-moscow-s-useful-idiot">Trump as a useful idiot of Russia</a>. His actions since then may determine that an underestimation.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Trump is <a href="http://thehill.com/blogs/blog-briefing-room/news/316463-conway-lifting-russian-sanctions-under-consideration">speaking with Putin soon regarding the lifting of sanctions.</a></p></li>
<li><p>Leaks, unsubstantiated though given the above hardly far fetched, have <a href="http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2016/10/veteran-spy-gave-fbi-info-alleging-russian-operation-cultivate-donald-trump">identified Trump as a Russian asset cultivated over at least the last five years.</a></p></li>
<li><p>Allegations have emerged that Russia has both the carrot of the oil money and <a href="http://www.nationalreview.com/corner/443752/trump-kompromat-story-its-all-disturbing">the stick of kompromat - incriminating evidence used as blackmail - to encourage Trump&#39;s pro-Putin action.</a></p></li>
<li><p>Russia has arrested two high ranking Russian cyber intelligence officials for treason - <a href="http://wccftech.com/fsb-official-us-spy-russia/">potentially because of their role as US spies.</a></p></li>
<li><p>A third Russian hacker is currently in a US-Russian tug of war while <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/jan/27/us-russia-hacking-yevgeniy-nikulin-linkedin-dropbox">in jail in Prague, with a potential connection to the Huma Abedin</a> emails that were discovered in October and which may have tipped the election to Trump.</p></li>
<li><p>Russian officials are <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/us-intercepts-capture-senior-russian-officials-celebrating-trump-win/2017/01/05/d7099406-d355-11e6-9cb0-54ab630851e8_story.html?utm_term=.f6dff8a035e8">celebrating the election of Trump and are joyous over their efforts to elect him.</a></p></li>
<li><p>John McCain laments that <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/jan/27/john-mccain-says-us-has-no-strategy-to-deal-with-russian-cyber-warfare">we have no unified response to Russian cyber-intrusion, which he likened to an act of war.</a></p></li>
</ul>

<p>We&#39;re getting fucked, royally, by a Trump-Putin alliance that is out for oil money and the destruction of western democracies. That&#39;s potentially why <a href="http://realtimepolitics.com/2017/01/13/breaking-rep-john-storms-out-of-trump-intel-briefing-trump-not-a-legitimate-president/">John Lewis</a> and other Democratic law makers who left a recent intel briefing on the Russian interference called Trump &quot;illegitimate&quot; and part of a Russian conspiracy.</p>
