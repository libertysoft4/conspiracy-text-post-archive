        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>First, obligatory link to the continuously-updated Astroturfing Information Megathread.  Its main purpose is to <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/shills/comments/4kdq7n/astroturfing_information_megathread_revision_8/?st=iyc3jh2c&amp;sh=892c7094">categorize and archive factual information on shilling.</a> It currently has over 70 citations, mostly reports in the mainstream press detailing various astroturfing programs by many governments and corporations. We also have a <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/shills/comments/5pzcnx/shill_confessions_and_additional_information/?st=iyc3r7x4&amp;sh=fe5da973">list of shill confessions.</a> </p>

<hr/>

<p>A lot of people have the false impression that Reddit is a niche wonderland (or wasteland), unknown to the majority of the country. This causes people to question why anyone would hire Reddit shills in the first place. If there isn&#39;t much of an audience, why manipulate Reddit? </p>

<p>At least until very recently with the change in the submission vote count, a post on <a href="/r/all">/r/all</a> may have received 6,000 upvotes. Does this mean that 6,000 people liked the post, and perhaps a total of 10,000 viewed it? Not even close. </p>

<p>Comparing Reddit.com to CNN.com, Reddit is 3 times more popular. The majority of Reddit&#39;s traffic is what is on <a href="/r/all">/r/all</a> during peak traffic hours, which is around 6-10 pm EST. Shills may not be interested in most of the content of a subreddit, but you bet they will be interested in the top post, especially if it hits <a href="/r/all">/r/all</a> or has the potential to later in the day. </p>

<p>CNN.com averages about <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2008/11/05/record-traffic-day-at-cnncom-27-million-uniques-276-million-page-views/">5 million unique visitors per day</a> and 417 million per month. </p>

<p>Foxnews.com: <a href="https://www.similarweb.com/website/foxnews.com#overview">240 million per month</a></p>

<p>MSNBC.com: <a href="https://www.similarweb.com/website/msnbc.com#overview">20-30 million per month</a></p>

<p><strong>However, Reddit.com is the</strong> <a href="http://www.alexa.com/siteinfo/reddit.com">7th most popular website</a> <strong>in the United States and has</strong> <a href="https://www.similarweb.com/website/reddit.com#overview">1.2 <strong>b</strong>illion unique visitors per month.</a></p>

<p>For television, <a href="http://www.mediaite.com/online/fox-news-leads-in-revenue-ratings-cnn-gets-the-largest-surge-in-viewership/">the total average viewership over a 24-hour period in 2015 for CNN was 490,000; for MSNBC 352,000; and Fox News 1.1 million viewers.</a> (Monthly totals would be about 10 million, 15 million, and 30 million)</p>

<p>You may have seen the post on The_Donald that claimed their subreddit has more traffic than CNN. This was a shitpost, but as you can see above, they were on the right track. </p>

<p>The Donald has about 2.5 - 3 million unique IP addresses per month, and about 200 - 250 thousand unique IP addresses per day. The claim that The_Donald has more traffic than CNN is obviously wrong. </p>

<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/the_donald/about/traffic/">https://www.reddit.com/r/the_donald/about/traffic/</a></p>

<p><a href="/r/pics">/r/pics</a> gives a better picture of the kind of traffic and engagement that <a href="/r/all">/r/all</a> can receive. They have about a half million unique visitors per day and about 8 million per month. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/pics/about/traffic/">https://www.reddit.com/r/pics/about/traffic/</a></p>

<p>You can check other subreddits by substituting the name of the sub (if they allow the traffic stats to be available to the public)</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>The 1% rule states that the number of people who create content on the Internet represents approximately 1% of the people actually viewing that content. For example, for every person who posts on a forum, generally about 99 other people are viewing that forum but not posting. The term was coined by authors and bloggers Ben McConnell and Jackie Huba,[2] although earlier references to the same concept[3] did not use this name.</p>

<p>The terms lurk and lurking, in reference to online activity, are used to refer to online observation without engaging others in the community, and were first used by veteran print journalist, P Tomi Austin, circa 1990, when her presence was noticed by other users in chat rooms, who queried her reasons for not engaging in chat. There were repeated inquiries about her identity and her refusal to engage in chat. The etiquette was, apparently, to greet other users upon entry into the chat rooms/sites. At the time, (then in her 30s, surfing among users averaging in their teens and 20s) she was only identified as &quot;Bilbo&quot;, she explained that she was a mature, but computer-literate, user and novice to chat, and preferred to lurk, or was lurking to familiarize herself with the chat culture, etiquette, and the sites to which she had logged on. In some instances, she needed to explain her coinage of the term &quot;lurking&quot;, as the term was new to the online community, but others quickly understood her meaning. To her knowledge, the terms had not been used prior to that period, and there appears to be no earlier dated reference to the coinage. There appears to be no attribution to the coinage that pre-dates the early 1990s.[citation needed]</p>

<p>For example, a 2005 study of radical Jihadist forums found 87% of users had never posted on the forums, 13% had posted at least once, 5% had posted 50 or more times, and only 1% had posted 500 or more times.[4]</p>

<p>The &quot;90–9–1&quot; version of this rule states that for websites where users can both create and edit content, 1% of people create content, 9% edit or modify that content, and 90% view the content without contributing.</p>

<p>The actual percentage is likely to vary depending upon the subject matter.</p>

They will flood the internet with propaganda the same way the western world does. There are more non-western people than western people. It doesnt matter if they lie or say the truth.
