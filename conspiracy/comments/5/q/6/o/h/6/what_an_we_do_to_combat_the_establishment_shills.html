    <div class="md"><p>Okay, fair enough. I will work hard to employ all these strategies. Thank you so much for taking the time to lay them out there for me. It&#39;s been hard to not feel absolutely frustrated and angry, especially after their takeover of the politics sub and all of Reddit. When that happened I hunkered down in r/conspiracy but now they&#39;re taking over my favorite sub too and it gets discouraging. But I will fight the fine fight w/reason, sources and civility for the lurkers and keep in mind to forget about the shills. Thanks again!! Much appreciated! </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, you&#39;re so correct. I can&#39;t count the number of times I got called a cunt for defending trump as a outspoken Jill supporter-lol! It does devolve rather quickly.

<p>So what you&#39;re really saying is that you want an echo chamber.</p>

<p>Believe it or not, people critical of Donald Trump aren&#39;t all CTR shills.</p>

<p>And believe it or not, a lot of us think that the Donald Trump shills defending him nonstop <em>are the real problem</em> in <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>.</p>

<p>Trump and Obama both came in with similar messages and celebrity cult of personality, hope and change, hope and change.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Trump is already fulfilling most of his campaign promises (I think all but one now in less than 5 days!) despite the gnashing of the teeth by the real establishment (swamp) and media.  And I&#39;m already enjoying Trump every single day. I couldn&#39;t be happier I decided at the last minute to vote for him, because with each passing day, I am more and more impressed and feel more optimistic day after day in the people&#39;s America. On top of him actually working hard, getting shit down under budget and ahead of schedule, he still finds time to troll the media. I have gone to bed and wake up with a smile on my face every day since his inauguration. All I wanted for election/inauguration day was not Hillary but I got so much more!! </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;d rather not have a in-depth discussion about politics with someone who chooses to remain so uninformed that they haven&#39;t even heard of the TPP, so this is all I&#39;ll be saying about the matter:</p>

<p>I find it amazing that you&#39;d even say something so dumb as 1). Trump is a do-nothing Obama 2.0 who hasn&#39;t fulfilled one of his campaign promises.</p>

<p>Yet, he&#39;s already fulfilled several of them and you, although grossly uninformed, choose to say w/confidence that he hasn&#39;t even fulfilled one. </p>

<p>So I reply and name one, but you haven&#39;t heard of it. Then despite not hearing of the TPP, you seem to know w/certainty that Hillary or Bernie would have put an end to the TPP when we on r/conspiracy had so many threads about how Hillary was all for the TPP and that she would pass it if Obama couldn&#39;t get it through. Proof was in the Podesta emails released by wikileaks in plain English, no debate about it. So sorry, but you&#39;re uninformed and wrong again on that count too.  </p>

<p>Secondly, if you were paying attention, you would have known there was no chance Bernie could win with that lying criminal and nomination stealing Hillary and the DNC. Yes, Bernie was opposed to the TPP but he signed a nonaggression pact w/HRC, so even Bernie knew there was no chance of winning the nomination and ending the TPP. Source: wikileaks -there&#39;s tons of threads here about it. </p>

<p>The only person who could have ended the TPP did, and we all have Donald Trump to thank for that. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have eyes and can read and have past experience to remember and draw upon. Top comments from non regulars that love Hillary and the CIA and MSM?!?! And not just that, but hundreds of upvotes. We have excellent high-content posters here who never got hundreds of upvotes for their comments. In fact, regulars are getting down voted like crazy. I know who the regulars are and that is not normal. This sub has been overrun with shills, maybe it&#39;s already been taken over. I have never seen such high activity and popularity of comments that are antithetical to r/conspiracy. </p>

<p>But, I will say I haven&#39;t had my comments removed or anything like you are describing. I also keep cheerleading to t_d where it belongs, I like to come here to have rational conversations with people that might not agree with me. Shoot, I am not that huge of a fan of Trumps, it was just fun to be a fan. And we can still have decent conversations here, sometimes. It is getting more rare though, it is completely infested with people that are obviously not really part of the community, or the unfortunates that drank too much of one koolaid or the other, and aren&#39;t much use to anyone.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Excuse me, but what can&#39;t I prove? Where did I call someone a shill in this thread or others? Why are you bringing up another thread that has nothing to do with this one?? I replied to you in the other thread already. </p>

<p>Do you not think shills exist like Hillary&#39;s super PAC one that got like $6 or 7 million to shill on Reddit? I can easily provide proof for that. </p>

<p>Have you not read the OP because you&#39;re not making any sense at all. I&#39;ll write it out slower for you: this thread isn&#39;t about me losing an argument and calling someone a shill-in fact, you&#39;ll find that no where that that happened because those comments get removed and you get banned for doing that. Again, slower: this thread is solely about combating the shill army, not proving that they exist. It&#39;s obvious they exist. But feel free to lie and gaslight just like the record ctr did as they too denied the presence of shills until we had hard proof. By that time, mods and admins were corrupted-all dissent got removed/banned and you couldn&#39;t even utter the name CTR nor mention shills. </p>

<p>I know shills exist, it&#39;s pretty established ctr was a thing. The problem is people on this sub always complain about shills when it&#39;s just people who don&#39;t agree with them. Why the fuck would you even pay shills to come to this sub? If they did it&#39;d look like politics did, which it pretty clearly doesn&#39;t resemble at all.</p>

<p>I get what this thread is about, I&#39;m saying you&#39;re calling people shills when they&#39;re just regular people. I know it&#39;s not about proving their presence because you can&#39;t prove it. Know why? Because you aren&#39;t arguing with shills.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hey, do you remember what my op was about? Maybe you forgot the topic. Again, I didn&#39;t make the post to prove anything to anyone about the presence or non presence of shills in this sub. This was a post asking for tips in dealing with shills, which is something that has been a REAL and PROVEN thing that has happening on reddit for the last year or two by Hillary&#39;s super PAC CTR. I was asking for tips in how to combat the presence of shills and you came here to --what? -- harass me? </p>

<p>I&#39;m not sure why you think I think everyone that disagrees with me is a shill. Where have I said that or accused everyone who disagrees with me a shill? Where??? But I don&#39;t want to waste any more of my time talking to you, so yes, every bot, shill and human on the internet and real life who disagrees with me is a shill; that includes my Hillary supporting friends and even my husband who often disagrees with me, they&#39;ll all shills. You&#39;re so right. There. You happy? Can we agree to disagree already? I&#39;d like to get back to the actual topic of my post now, if you don&#39;t mind. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Honestly it&#39;s a waste of both our time to keep going on the first part of this argument.</p>

<p>Advice: beat them in the argument, calling them in a shill is like me discrediting you for being a Trump supporter, it just makes our argument look weaker. </p>

<p>Don&#39;t engage in distractions, especially ad-hominems. I&#39;ve been guilty of this in pizzagate threads, but when I stopped I found I actually agreed with the person on quite a few things and we were able to better debate the actual topics we felt differently on, sometimes ya gotta agree to disagree.</p>

<p>When the argument reaches a stalemate there&#39;s no reason to keep repeating yourself, if they are a shill they want you to waste your time, just say you disagree, summarize with what and why, and leave it there if no new discussion is spawned.</p>

<p>That&#39;s what I can think of off the top of my head.</p>

I guess you won&#39;t be satisfied until I get nothing but 100% anti-trump all the time? Well, no thanks. I don&#39;t like to live in the alternative fictitious reality of the MSM, which is all lies all of the time. Fuck me for being a free thinker and wanting TRUTH.</p>

<p>For what it&#39;s worth, I don&#39;t expect not want r/conspiracy to be r/the_donald or pro trump. That&#39;s why I come here: to get a neutral source, to search out the truth. The regulars of r/conspiracy realize that left v right is all political theatre. We are not partisan here but truth seekers and that&#39;s why I used to love this place. </p>

<p>There tons of shills here. Anyone saying otherwise makes me think they&#39;re probably a shill too. It&#39;s so obvious and something that upsets me greatly is feeling like my intelligence is constantly being insulted. Yeah, like I really believe that this sub overnight has become a Hillary loving, media loving, vaccine/gmo loving, &quot;experts say&quot; bullshit, and frankly, anti conspiracy. Yep, Soros&#39; shills have really fooled me. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You think people must be shills because they disagree with you. T_D doesn&#39;t just ban shills, it bans any criticism of trump, which is what you want. Can you even post examples of ctr shilling that doesn&#39;t have a Trump supporter equivalent?</p>

<p>And what don&#39;t you believe? Maybe leave your fucking echo chambers for once and you&#39;d see most people don&#39;t like him, you got fooled, guess those alternative facts work on you.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>T_D is a cheerleading sub for trump. They don&#39;t claim to be a neutral sub like the joke that the main politics sub is. So just like you can&#39;t talk shit about Bernie or Hillary in their respective cheerleading subs, you can&#39;t do it in t_d either. </p>

<p>And yeah, you&#39;re right, I should leave my echo chamber because all of Reddit except for r/the_donald is PRO trump -- and Facebook, Twitter, every single MSM and comment section, PredictIt comment section, NPR and all other mainstream radio, every mainstream magazine is PRO Trump. Then I step outside the internet to real life in wonderful liberal Los Angeles where there is a real life constant PRO TRUMP agenda. Btw, all my liberal Hillary voting friends are Pro trump, so I get so much pro trump stuff there too. Yeah, every where I turn, I&#39;m faced with so much PRO TRUMP stuff, it&#39;s unbelievable and I really need to step outside that echo chamber. You&#39;re so right. </p>

<p>Also, as far as my comment history on the inauguration photo, I stand by the fact that there are shills all over that thread. How did I form that conclusion? Probably the implicit trust and deference to MSM in people&#39;s comments, citing them as proof! as if r/conspiracy regulars have ever trusted the media!! Try again! </p>

<p>And what are you even trying to say here? Yes, leave your echo chamber and see the world is overwhelmingly anti-trump you&#39;ll see its not that weird for reddit to be anti-trump as well.</p>

<p>So because people don&#39;t think everything the msm says is a lie they are shills? Honestly that&#39;s retarded.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Your last point is a straw man argument, so I&#39;m not gonna bother with it. </p>

<p>You are correct about one thing: the world (those a part of the global MSM and all the world&#39;s government, aka the establishment, is anti-trump.) And to me, that&#39;s his best feature! But it&#39;s funny you&#39;re trying to get me to believe that regular Americans are anti-trump when he is the one America choose, mostly the silent MAJORITY. They are silent because they don&#39;t want to lose their friends, family, job, social standing, or be physically harmed or their property damaged. Have you seen the destruction, violence and hysterics from the Hillary-living left? I don&#39;t ever hear from Trump supporters for this reason; therefore, it&#39;d be pretty difficult for me to even try to live in an echo chamber. Try again. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Only the last half, the point about it being retarded to assume everything the msm says is a lie is still true.</p>

<p>Most people didn&#39;t vote for trump, you know that right? The majority did not vote for trump, the majority of voters did not vote for trump either. America is largely anti-trump no matter how far you stick your fingers into your ears and scream, and even people who did support trump can still point out when he&#39;s doing stupid shit like what he&#39;s doing with the EPA, or his many lies, or whatever else they don&#39;t like.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, you&#39;re right about this being a tough crowd to deceive. I never mind dissenting opinions because free speech is extremely important, which is why paid shills are so frustrating. It&#39;s censorship and it wastes so much time and we are never able to talk about the real important issues but stay instead debating the stupid shit that MSM and whoever sets the shills&#39; narrative want us to talk about.  TPTB through its tentacles of Msm and shills set the narrative always. How can we get around this when we&#39;re talking about politics which is a running topic through most conspiracies? How do we not fall into the traps of shills wasting our time through asking stupid questions or feigning ignorance on subjects and wasting our time pointlessly debating trivial bs? -This would have been a better question instead of my OP. </p>
