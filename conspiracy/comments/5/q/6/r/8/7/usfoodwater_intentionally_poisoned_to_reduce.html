It&#39;s also heavily subsidised by the US government, and the &quot;food pyramid&quot; was a scam with no scientific basis designed to increase consumption of sugar and other carbohydrates.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>For sure</p>

<p>The advent of compulsory education in the United States originated out of Prussia, which was within the area of modern Germany today. The Prussian Monarchy divided the education system into three groups: those who were to make policy: those who would assist the policy makers, the engineers, doctors, lawyers and architects; and the rest would be the common laborers.</p>

<p>Using the basic philosophy prescribing the “duties of the state,” combined with John Locke’s view (1690) that “children are a blank slate” and lessons from Rousseau on how to “write on the slate,” Prussia established a three-tiered educational system that was considered “scientific” in nature. Work began in 1807 and the system was in place by 1819. An important component of the Prussian system was how it defined for the child what was to be learned, what was to be thought, how long to think about it and when a child was to be allowed to think of something else. (This is where the Pavlovian bell-ringing each hour of class time comes from in our current school system.)</p>

<p>Our current education system is broken. It&#39;s still primarily designed to produce &quot;common laborers&quot;. This is of no fault of the great teachers, since they are forced to work within the confines of a system designed to fail our children, by intentionally controlling &quot;what is to be thought&quot;, &quot;how long to think about it&quot; and &quot;when a child is allowed to think of something else&quot;...</p>

<p>I believe great teachers are still very noble in their profession, but unfortunately &quot;limited&quot; by the broken education system as to how much they can inspire &quot;creative&quot;, &quot;inventive&quot;, &quot;free thinking&quot;, and &quot;critical thinking students&quot;... So we as parents must do our best to constantly inspire &quot;creative&quot;, &quot;independent&quot;, &quot;critical/constructive&quot;, &quot;inventive&quot;, &quot;free spirited&quot; thought...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have a roommate who has changed his eating patterns along with me. We both use almost all natural health products and drink on-fluoridated water. He even meditates daily, while I only do so before falling asleep. I feel amazing, and have found my mental imaging enhance a lot. I am able to vividly re-imagine childhood memories I had forgotten. Unfortunately my friend can not.</p>

<p>I have recently gone through some powerful emotional experiences (loss and the fear of loss) so my mental state, my view of myself in the world, and my lack of fear have been key to my greater awakening. My friend has not had such realizations, he claims he still does not have very good mental imaging. </p>

<p>I think it goes to always existing in your own aura of love. Not having fear of death or judgement from peers. My friend has never been as confident as I am and claims to have severe social anxiety. I have always been outspoken, curious, and indignated. Those traits along with some personal goals I know I want and which I have started to focus on have really propelled my mood. </p>

<p>In addition to all of this I have had a truly blessed upbringing and I have experienced unconditional love from my family members for as long as I can remember. I have come to this realization after coming out of what I would call an &quot;egotistical rebellion phase&quot; which I was half-growing out of. With the loss of my grandfather I went through the traditional stages of grief and it really centered me on who I have always been. </p>

<p>I also payed off the ganja.</p>

<p>Everyone has there own Dharma.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Invest in a good water filtration. One that removes fluorides and metals. </p>

<p>Read up on healthier foods, avoid fast foods as much as applicable.</p>

<p>You will notice a difference.</p>

<p>With the Internet at our fingertips, the ones who don&#39;t ask questions like you are doing, choose to remain ignorant.</p>

<p>So you&#39;re on the right path, it&#39;s not always easy, but when you see how the food is made and hear how pigs being carted off in trucks to slaughterhouses start crying 2 blocks away because &quot;they know&quot; - It changes things.</p>

<p>Don&#39;t trust anyone but yourself, do the research.

    <div class="md"><p>Agreed. Ending most of my meat consumption has been a big help to me. I think it might be that we need to know WHY we are not eating meat as feel GOOD about not doing it because you know you are RIGHT. Being a guilty social pressures vegan is not what I recommend. I have a theory that your body is better at digesting when we are in a good mood, wish I could prove it. But also don&#39;t put shitty chemicals in your body (that may come from anxious meat products as well)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There are vegan alternatives, just gotta look! </p>

<p>And going completely vegan is different for everyone. Cheese and milk are from the animals. Do what feels right for you, do what you think is best.</p>

<p>I went with soylent drink to replace meals. There was the &quot;matrix food&quot; called <a href="https://huel.com/">huel</a> but it&#39;s only sold in Europe, drats. I don&#39;t mind trying out new things like that, it sounds awesome. Soylent tastes like liquid cornflakes and freedom lol. It&#39;s really not that bad at all, IMHO.</p>

<p>If you&#39;re religious, go with the bible diet. Just gotta research and see what&#39;s best in your world :)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah... being a busy and cheap college student gives me too many excuses sometimes. LOL
I&#39;ve been interested in soylent, but never gave it much serious consideration. </p>

<p>Bible diet sounds neat too, and yes I am a believer :)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I feel confident that the reason Flint water <strong>still</strong> hasn&#39;t been properly investigated is because they aren&#39;t alone and it might blow the lid off the fact that consumer class populations have been intentionally poisoned with lead piping from the outset.</p>

<p>Regarding fluoride, I was interested to learn recently that the hospital at which the initial fluoride studies were done (and determined to be mandatory for all consumer drinking water) is actually the same naval base that most of the nazi scientists from operation paperclip were relocated to.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>r/uncensorednews is much better than only reading Google news or only watching mainstream media.</p>

<p>You need to train yourself to be a critical thinker, if you haven&#39;t already. It&#39;s also said that few people have the ability to hold two opposing ideas at the same time. As much as you can contemplate two or more opposing ideas at the same time, your intuition and the universal information field will more often guide you to the truth. Besides always eating and drinking as healthy as possible, living from peace and love within, in a balanced, happy centered way of life will help you to more frequently experience truth and elevated levels of higher consciousness.</p>
