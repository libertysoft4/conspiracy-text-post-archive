    <div class="md"><p>It is too bad that environmental issues have become so politicized as to be meaningless. It is really hard to tell if the EPA is a legitimate org just doing its best to make sure that our environment remains pure, and is just persecuted by Big Oil and the like, or if it was co-opted by the same influences that drive stuff like the crazy org that runs that anti-whaling boat team. I still think whaling is gross and needlessly destructive btw, it is just those people are lunatics.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know what to believe anymore. I used to work with the EPA though, and from my side it seemed very bureaucratic, but not necessarily politicized . Bear in mind, the way I worked with them wasn&#39;t in any area approaching controversy.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The combination of an over-regulating EPA + cheap foreign trade with countries with poor regulation makes it an absolutely deadly combination for the world, so those who care for the environment should push for more goods to be made in America with reasonable standards rather than in China with god-knows-what, because it pollutes the same Earth we all live on. I think a lot of people don&#39;t take this into consideration, particularly because when you also factor in the additional transportation pollution, it&#39;s a really bad deal for all of us. In a very counter-intuitive way, it is WAY better to cut regulations so you can make stuff at home as long as you are polluting equal or less than the competitors. If the goods you want are very toxic to make, like steel and semiconductors (hence not economical to make in USA due to EPA in part) then it is not logical to make it uneconomic at home and then exploit from another country. </p>

<p>But yeah the more we can do to stop using supertankers and container ships constantly, that is literally FREE pollution off the table. Even if it&#39;s not helping the environment, at least you&#39;re not doing MORE damage to the Earth overall by making it somewhere else with looser regulations and extra transportation. </p>

<p>Don&#39;t worry, though. The &quot;jobs&quot; are not going back to the US as long as it retains its stranglehold on reserve currency and petrodollar statuses. But once it lets go of these 2, it means that the US citizens would finally be &quot;competitive&quot;, because the US will go through hyperinflation when every country dumps the Federal Reserve Dollar.</p>

The EPA is infecting the business environment with a plague of new regulations and is compounding its affliction on the economy by denying permits for job-creating projects,&quot; said Tom Borelli, Ph.D., director of the National Center&#39;s Free Enterprise Project. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>What you and other trump fans are so slow to see or completely ignore are the tell tale signs.</p>

<p>Trumps has already broke the emoluments clause by not putting his investments into a blind trust. He is able to profit off his decisions and regulate against his enemies. This is a first for ANY us president.</p>

<p>Trump has not disclosed his tax returns. Not illegal but every president before him has agreed to this out of transparency. </p>

<p>Trump has assigned probably the worst cabinet in history. Most of the people he has assigned have ZERO experience in their department.</p>

<p>Trump is attacking the first amendment by only allowing his brand of news out of the White House. </p>

<p>Trump wants to put a 20% tarrif on imported goods from mexico. If you have no idea how disaterous this is then you never heard of this
<a href="http://capitalism.org/free-trade/what-was-the-end-result-of-the-smoot-hawley-tariff-act">http://capitalism.org/free-trade/what-was-the-end-result-of-the-smoot-hawley-tariff-act</a></p>

<p>You also wouldn&#39;t understand how badly every state would be affected by such a ridiculous tarrif.</p>

<p>The wall would also not only be a huge economic pitfall but would destroy the local environment in the area.</p>

<p>Which leads us to trump silencing the EPA. Some here believe they are corrupt but really they are a mostly independent agency. Here is a describing quote.</p>

<p>The EPA has its headquarters in Washington, D.C., regional offices for each of the agency&#39;s ten regions, and 27 laboratories. The agency conducts environmental assessment, research, and education. It has the responsibility of maintaining and enforcing national standards under a variety of environmental laws, in consultation with state, tribal, and local governments. It delegates some permitting, monitoring, and enforcement responsibility to U.S. states and the federally recognized tribes. EPA enforcement powers include fines, sanctions, and other measures. The agency also works with industries and all levels of government in a wide variety of voluntary pollution prevention programs and energy conservation efforts.</p>

<p>In reality Congress determines a regulation, the EPA provides the data to back up the regulation, then continues testing to ensure guidelines are met.</p>

<p>So why would trump want to stop the EPA? If he wanted to fight corruption he would attack the Congress for passing the corrupt laws not the governing body that reviews them.</p>

<p>Trump is silencing his opposition, he has done it with the Cia, the media and now on an agency who sole duty is to protect its citizens and it&#39;s environment.</p>

<p>Now if you believe that any of the above things are untrue, please provide me with sources. If you agree with any of these points that I have made then you are close to understanding  that trump is nowhere close to qualified to be leader of the free world.</p>

<p>All of the above are signs of a regime that has no interest in its people, land or freedom. And before I am done let me drop this little gem on you</p>

<p>No President should fear public scrutiny of his program. For from that scrutiny comes understanding; and from that understanding comes support or opposition. And both are necessary. I am not asking your newspapers to support the Administration, but I am asking your help in the tremendous task of informing and alerting the American people. For I have complete confidence in the response and dedication of our citizens whenever they are fully informed.</p>

<p>I not only could not stifle controversy among your readers--I welcome it. This Administration intends to be candid about its errors; for as a wise man once said: &quot;An error does not become a mistake until you refuse to correct it.&quot; We intend to accept full responsibility for our errors; and we expect you to point them out when we miss them.</p>

<p>Without debate, without criticism, no Administration and no country can succeed--and no republic can survive. That is why the Athenian lawmaker Solon decreed it a crime for any citizen to shrink from controversy. And that is why our press was protected by the First Amendment-- the only business in America specifically protected by the Constitution- -not primarily to amuse and entertain, not to emphasize the trivial and the sentimental, not to simply &quot;give the public what it wants&quot;--but to inform, to arouse, to reflect, to state our dangers and our opportunities, to indicate our crises and our choices, to lead, mold, educate and sometimes even anger public opinion.</p>

<p>--John F. Kennedy</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Let me say this. I am not a super Trump fan. I think there are concerns with his administration picks and with his financial ties. However, he is the president so we have to deal with that. </p>

<p>As for the EPA, I think there is much work to be done with that agency. Putting a halt on things for however brief will allow them to assess the main concerns. It is evident by the links I posted this has been an issue for sometime now. So, my original comment on this &quot;pants on fire&quot; anonymous letter still stands. People are so riled up right now, everything has become a pants on fire situation. </p>

<p>From what I have read today, they are looking to return control of the EPA to the states. They are not shutting down the EPA, they just halted parts that have already been accused of going against the rule set forth by congress with regards to communications to the public. <a href="https://www.google.com/amp/www.forbes.com/sites/henrymiller/2016/03/09/epa-remains-a-paragon-of-government-waste-fraud-and-abuse/?client=safari">this goes into that issue</a> </p>

<p>I&#39;m not here to fight, I promise. But I&#39;m also not here to join the crowd of pants on fire. I hope this explains my position a little better. If I was rude previously, I apologize, that was not my intention. It seems not freaking out pisses people off these days, and honestly it&#39;s wearing my patience thin. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Where was the EPA when Flint was being poisoned?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency had the authority and information to take decisive action on the lead contamination of Flint&#39;s drinking water in June of 2015 -- seven months before it acted, a federal watchdog said Thursday.</p>

<p>The Office of Inspector General for the EPA said the agency should have issued an emergency order to protect Flint residents from the contaminated water. The EPA didn&#39;t issue such an order until Jan. 21 of this year.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I support protecting water from pollution, but it doesn&#39;t like the EPA is currently up to the task.</p>

<p>I agree with this sarcastic comment. The amount of people in here lately thinking the government always has our best interests at heart  is truly baffling. The govt. has demonstrated over and over that they only have their own existence in mind. They&#39;d short-dick every cannibal in the Congo to keep their cushy, make-work jobs.</p>

<p>Last I checked, oil companies like those repped by Rex Tillerson ACTUALLY abuse individuls by threatening landowners who don&#39;t want a pipeline or fracking operation on their land and obtaining undeserved easements that force the landowners to accept the corporations using their land for profit and eventually poisoning their water.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Don&#39;t know about everybody else but I&#39;ve noticed a lack of planes spraying over my house since friday.  Before that nearly everyday was heavy heavy plane traffic with tons of cloud seeding especially the past few months.  Plane after plane would fly over my property in front of the suns path through the sky turning empty blue sky into grey smudge.  </p>

<p>If the EPA was running the chem trails  to block the sun maybe it got shut down with this administration.  I have to imagine the operating costs of that much air traffic is incredibly high.  And I am not seeing planes on the same path that are not spraying making me believe they were running military planes not passenger.  Heres a pic from election day <a href="http://imgur.com/S7yt9mA">http://imgur.com/S7yt9mA</a>. </p>

<p>Also something I&#39;m curious about, why is it when there is an oil spill the EPA cleans it up, the oil company/transport company pay a fine which is tax deductable and business continues. That reeks of a conspiracy to me more than them being shut down. It smells like double dipping.</p>

<p>Let&#39;s see what&#39;s going on and what facts come to light and then I&#39;ll take a position on it. For now I&#39;ll keep an open mind.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m really not sure what the story is here.   Scott Pruitt hasn&#39;t been confirmed yet.   The EPA is basically without a leader right now because the Senate Democrats are purposefully dragging out the process.     </p>

<p>We know the new leader is going to drastically change the agencies goals and mission - for the better most certainly.    So its no surprise that the employees have been told to cease and desist.   Whats troubling is that so many of them are whining to social media about.    I guess that makes &quot;who to terminate&quot; pretty easy though.    Guaranteed there is a social media clause in their employee handbooks that makes this an easy thing to do.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree with what the EPA is supposed to stand for, but don&#39;t agree with a lot of the things the EPA actually does.  It&#39;s frustrating to speak on these things just to be met with an empty, self-righteous &quot;but don&#39;t you care about the environment?!&quot;  If we can&#39;t criticize the failures of an organization just because their mission statement is agreeable, or a person just because their words sound nice, how are we supposed to call for solutions and improvements? The same corporations the EPA is supposed to regulate control the EPA, so it&#39;s not going to fix itself from the inside.  </p>

<p>Disdain for the EPA is not disdain for the environment. It&#39;s really a pet-peeve of mine when people think one means the other.</p>
