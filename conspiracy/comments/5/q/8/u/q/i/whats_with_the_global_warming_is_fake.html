<p>What makes you think the elites are sprewing this propaganada of Global Warming and how will this help them?
I have watched the Documentary of Leornado De caprio,it was quite convincing and there were indeed factual evidence which suggest that Global Warming is indeed real.</p>

<p>But one thing I don&#39;t see is how did the Elite not suppress the documetary? because it shows how policies in US are designed to counteract the solar power for the boost of Coal and petrodollar?</p>

<p>If Caprio is a Hollywood puppet why did they let him release the documentary wouldn&#39;t it Red pill the masses of the hidden power?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I literally have no idea either way. I studied environmental and physical science in college, and they really drilled into us there at global warming is real, CO2 is bad, coal plants are bad, all that stuff. Then I read on r/conspiracy and around here and there that global warming is basically something the powers that be and the elite are and will use to collectively adapt their dystopian policies, and further their one world agenda. We live in a world where global connectivity is instant now, they can&#39;t be using old 1920&#39;s tactics. They have to use global tactics, and global warming is something that affects the entire planet. </p>

<p>Is global warming real? Maybe, if it is real is it bad? Maybe. Is CO2 a major player in global warming? Maybe. Is global warming created by the elite to further their global domination? Maybe. Does the EPA and other agencies lie about their reports to bring about the global warming scare? Maybe. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Climate change is real. </p>

<p>The problem with climate change skepticism is that it assumes the heliocentric model is true.</p>

<p>We live on the inside of a <a href="https://youtu.be/25DaRKwGwNE?t=4m26s">concave earth</a> and the universe is small and at the center of the earth. There are several glass spheres hovering within the earth, which is why we have ionospheric reflection, rainbows and auroras.</p>

<p>The best evidence for this is the fact that airplanes have to fly at an upward angle of <a href="http://www.askcaptainlim.com/flying-the-plane-flying-90/1297-does-an-airplane-fly-3-degrees-upwards-or-downwards-during-the-cruise.html">3 degrees</a> in order to remain level with the ground.</p>

<p>Everything in the world is electric and driven by electricity. The sun moon and stars are all driven by electric energy.</p>

<p>Our clouds are also <a href="https://youtu.be/LUbC7i6Eu4Q?t=1:27">electric</a>.</p>

<p>So in other words, not only is our activity increasing the temperature, (although skeptics are correct in recognising that this is only a slight increase) but we are also disturbing the electro-magneto balance of our concave universe.</p>

<p>And it&#39;s already happening. The sun is <a href="http://www.nbcnews.com/id/3077334/ns/technology_and_science-science/t/strange-twists-our-spinning-planet/">slowing down</a></p>

<p>And at an increasing rate.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>By the middle of the next century, Herring says, the slowing down of Earth’s rotation will require a leap second every few months. And five or six decades from now, the atomic second will have to be adjusted as well. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Eventually the sun will stop. At this point the ice on the underside of the glass sky will melt and come falling to earth.</p>

<p>It will be like Armageddon.</p>

<p>So at the end of the day, what choice do the Illuminati have? Sure they could tell us the truth, but that would mean chaos and mass panic.</p>

<p>Once they declare global slavery, there will be no place for mass travel or meat consumption, so climate change will then be brought under control.</p>

<p>So called &#39;conspiracy theorists&#39; have to be herded in the direction of denying climate change altogether, the truth is too painful for the general public.</p>

<p><strong>Tl;dr</strong><br/>
Climate change is real, but it is much more serious than the public realises.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Many people go over the data with varying levels of scientific rigor. Science-y subs will have more of that.</p>

<p>As for the hypothetical motives people could have for faking or exaggerating it, that&#39;s easy.</p>

<p>Some of the world industrializes and becomes much more powerful and wealthy than other parts. The &quot;developing world&quot; starts to go through the same process but before they can become equals and competitors with the developed world, it turns out that more industrialization will kill the planet. Tough luck, developing world, no catching up to Europe for you.</p>

<p>There&#39;s also a lot of power in taxes and regulations. Those who control this could use it to favor certain companies or states at the expense of others. A fair system is difficult to develop even with the best of intentions. It saves energy to produce things locally, but what about countries that rely on exports? What about countries that rely on imports?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Climate has always changed. Suddenly &quot;scientists&quot; claim this time the change is caused by people. How do they do this? They started by limiting the terms of reference to determine what climate change is:</p>

<p>&quot;man-made changes&quot;.</p>

<p>So, in order to understand the changes that have always taken place, they said: man alone is doing it, show why.</p>

<p>This is nothing new. &quot;Witchcraft caused the famine, kill the witches&quot; and &quot;sinners caused the earthquake&quot;. This is just some more of exactly the same. </p>

<p>No matter what happens: Boston breaks it&#39;s snow record two years ago, and had 6 of their 10 snowiest winters after 1992, but some guy will without hesitation come along and say children may never see snow again.</p>

<p>There is no evidence that would ever convince these &quot;scientists&quot; that man is not changing the weather. Ask them, what would prove to you that the changes aren&#39;t being caused by man?</p>

<p>And that is the very gist of science is that there is some method to check if the theory is real.</p>

<p>The reality is that the warming trend is natural, is cyclical, has been going on for thousands of years, and will continue regardless of what humans do or don&#39;t do. But this warming trend is very slow, very mild, and not only harmless, but highly beneficial to life on earth. </p>

<p>Likewise, the increased amount of CO2 that is being emitted from factories and energy plants in India and China is not only harmless, but greatly beneficial to all plant life ... and what benefits the plants benefits the  plant eaters. That&#39;s us. MOre CO2 is doing us an enormous amount of good. And the lunatic alarmists want to reduce it and put a tax on it! They are totally out of touch with reality.</p>
