<ul>
<li><p>July 8, 2016 - Trump <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/politics/articles/2016-03-30/trump-russia-adviser-carter-page-interview">associate Carter Page</a> visits Moscow and receives an <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/carter-page-trump-russia-igor-sechin-dossier-2017-1">offer of equity from Russia in a massive Russian oil deal if Trump will lift US/EU sanctions.</a> These sanctions have <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/timdaiss/2016/08/19/prolonged-sanctions-rip-into-russia-causing-angst-for-putin/#2497241c4c2f">crippled the Russian economy and hamstrung their oligarchy.</a></p></li>
<li><p>July 18, 2016 - Trump&#39;s team makes one tweak to the RNC platform: <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/global-opinions/trump-campaign-guts-gops-anti-russia-stance-on-ukraine/2016/07/18/98adb3b0-4cf3-11e6-a7d8-13d06b37f256_story.html?utm_term=.bb24cd53f46b">a pro-Russia softening of our stance on their invasion of Ukraine/Crimea.</a></p></li>
<li><p>July 22, 2016 - Wikileaks dumps the DNC emails on the eve of the Democratic National Convention, helping hold down Clinton&#39;s favorability<a href="https://thenypost.files.wordpress.com/2016/07/nypost_20160726_brxp-1_001.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;strip=all"> among an incensed left</a> and <a href="https://www.digitalshadows.com/blog-and-research/rocking-the-vote-the-effects-of-cyber-activity-on-the-u-s-election/">boosting Trump&#39;s RNC bump</a> while holding Clinton to her lowest polling of the cycle.</p></li>
<li><p>July 27, 2016 - Trump tells the press that <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/news/archive/2016/07/trump-crimea/493280/">he would consider lifting sanctions on Russia and &quot;jokingly&quot; instructs Russia to continue to hack Clinton &quot;if they&#39;re listening.&quot;</a> It would be his last press conference of the election.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Now, of course, we know that:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>The hacking <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/obama-orders-review-of-russian-hacking-during-presidential-campaign/2016/12/09/31d6b300-be2a-11e6-94ac-3d324840106c_story.html?utm_term=.2431a5e9ccd1">was directed by Russia to help Trump win the election</a>.</p></li>

</ul>

<p>What has the Trump team been up to since then?</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Trump advisor <a href="http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2016/09/the-mystery-of-trumps-man-in-moscow-214283">Carter Page is under investigation for his ties to Russia.</a> He&#39;s <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/08/world/europe/carter-page-donald-trump-moscow-russia.html">continued to visit Moscow</a> in spite of that investigation.</p></li>
<li><p>The man who most likely offered Page the deal to offer to Trump was found <a href="https://cgrozev.wordpress.com/2017/01/14/tower-of-cards-part-1/">dead from gun shot wounds in the back of his car in Moscow in December.</a> The Russian state press has called his death a heart attack since the initial report (...in the back of his car, in an alley).</p></li>
<li><p>Trump advisor <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/15/us/politics/paul-manafort-ukraine-donald-trump.html">Paul Manafort, who left his official role as campaign chair last summer, is under investigation for his ties to Russia.</a> Manafort reemerged after the election <a href="http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2016/11/30/torture-lobbyist-paul-manafort-still-advising-donald-trump-on-cabinet-picks.html">to advise Trump on cabinet positions...</a></p></li>
<li><p>Rex Tillerson, former Exxon CEO, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/09/us/politics/rex-tillerson-secretary-of-state-exxon-donald-trump.html">emerged as a dark horse candidate for Secretary of State shortly thereafter.</a> Tillerson has extensive <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/kenrapoza/2016/12/15/trump-russia-exxon-tillerson/#662ae3e63a63">business ties to Russian oil and lobbied for a reduction in sanctions while at Exxon.</a> He has deep ties to the company that <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/us-exxon-rosneft-idUSBRE83H0UE20120418">offered Carter Page the equity deal</a>, may be <a href="https://www.publicintegrity.org/2016/12/18/20563/tillerson-directed-offshore-company-used-russia-deals">hiding oil assets in offshore tax shelters</a> as he <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/dec/18/leak-rex-tillerson-director-bahamas-based-us-russian-oil-company">has in the past, and has been awarded the Russian Order of Friendship honor by Putin.</a></p></li>
<li><p>Former military intelligence officer, and Trump&#39;s National Security Advisor, Gen. Michael Flynn <a href="http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2017/01/24/Why-We-ll-Never-Know-What-We-Need-About-Trump-s-Most-Important-Adviser-Michael-Flynn">was under investigation last week for his communications with Russia following a December increase in sanctions by Pres. Obama.</a> The Trump team have defended those calls with <a href="http://www.newsweek.com/trump-must-come-cleanflynn-secret-russian-calls-547583">various conflicting explanations.</a> After getting kicked out of the Obama DIA for his insubordination and islamaphobia, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/nearly-the-entire-national-security-establishment-has-rejected-trumpexcept-for-this-man/2016/08/15/d5072d96-5e4b-11e6-8e45-477372e89d78_story.html?utm_term=.7bd3442c0278">Flynn - the veteran intelligence office, cozied up to Putin.</a></p></li>
<li><p>Finally there is Trump advisor Roger Stone - a former <a href="http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,960803,00.html">business partner to Paul Manafort</a> who cut his teeth in politics as one of <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/lifestyle/1986/06/16/the-rise-and-gall-of-roger-stone/d8ce308b-7055-4666-860e-378833f46e17/?utm_term=.777ef7daf4dc">Nixon&#39;s  dirty trixsters.</a> Stone outed himself as a back-channel communicator <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/nov/02/trump-adviser-clinton-emails-wikileaks-roger-stone">between Wikileaks&#39;s Assagne and the Trump campaign</a> back in November. In his spare time before the election, Stone <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/20/citizens-for-donald-trump-exit-poll-roger-stone-rigged-election-claim">led the charge to cement the election as rigged in case of a Clinton victory.</a> He is also <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/19/us/politics/trump-russia-associates-investigation.html">under investigation by US intelligence</a>.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>During the campaign many described <a href="https://www.pri.org/stories/2016-12-16/former-cia-chief-calls-trump-moscow-s-useful-idiot">Trump as a useful idiot of Russia</a>. His actions since then may determine that an underestimation.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Trump is <a href="http://thehill.com/blogs/blog-briefing-room/news/316463-conway-lifting-russian-sanctions-under-consideration">speaking with Putin soon regarding the lifting of sanctions.</a></p></li>
<li><p>Leaks, unsubstantiated though given the above hardly far fetched, have <a href="http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2016/10/veteran-spy-gave-fbi-info-alleging-russian-operation-cultivate-donald-trump">identified Trump as a Russian asset cultivated over at least the last five years.</a></p></li>
<li><p>Allegations have emerged that Russia has both the carrot of the oil money and <a href="http://www.nationalreview.com/corner/443752/trump-kompromat-story-its-all-disturbing">the stick of kompromat - incriminating evidence used as blackmail - to encourage Trump&#39;s pro-Putin action.</a></p></li>
<li><p>Russia has arrested two high ranking Russian cyber intelligence officials for treason - <a href="http://wccftech.com/fsb-official-us-spy-russia/">potentially because of their role as US spies.</a></p></li>
<li><p>A third Russian hacker is currently in a US-Russian tug of war while <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/jan/27/us-russia-hacking-yevgeniy-nikulin-linkedin-dropbox">in jail in Prague, with a potential connection to the Huma Abedin</a> emails that were discovered in October and which may have tipped the election to Trump.</p></li>
<li><p>Russian officials are <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/us-intercepts-capture-senior-russian-officials-celebrating-trump-win/2017/01/05/d7099406-d355-11e6-9cb0-54ab630851e8_story.html?utm_term=.f6dff8a035e8">celebrating the election of Trump and are joyous over their efforts to elect him.</a></p></li>
<li><p>John McCain laments that <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/jan/27/john-mccain-says-us-has-no-strategy-to-deal-with-russian-cyber-warfare">we have no unified response to Russian cyber-intrusion, which he likened to an act of war.</a></p></li>
</ul>

<p>We&#39;re getting fucked, royally, by a Trump-Putin alliance that is out for oil money and the destruction of western democracies. That&#39;s potentially why <a href="http://realtimepolitics.com/2017/01/13/breaking-rep-john-storms-out-of-trump-intel-briefing-trump-not-a-legitimate-president/">John Lewis</a> and other Democratic law makers who left a recent intel briefing on the Russian interference called Trump &quot;illegitimate&quot; and part of a Russian conspiracy, and that the election would be <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/mark-pocan-cia-docs_us_58864a54e4b096b4a2338991">re-done if the same activities took place in other democracies</a>.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, Trump is not a sharp tool, so maybe he will report it on his taxes. If we ever see them, we would notice.</p>

<p>If he has halfway competent advisers (or a small percentage of brain function) there will be a hidden trail that leads to the money he bargained for. If he&#39;s lucky no one will ever find out.</p>

<p>There is no doubt, now, that Trump is not just a useful idiot for Russia, he is a willing and complicit member of this ongoing attempt to destroy democracy in America.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Lol, this is a great example for you. Brainwashed people siting what others say. Have you noticed the arguments used? What does it remind you? Aren&#39;t those arguments familiar? Its everything the media has been pushing the last year, isn&#39;t it? </p>

<p>Here&#39;s the thing, you first need to recognize what people are worth a second read and consideration. This post you can tell straight away is manipulated thoughts, miss information, ego and personal beliefs and mixed unclear thoughts trying to project personal beliefs. If someone is not able to provide intelligent arguments and evidence of how his thoughts came to be and justification then its a quick read and move on, waste of time. An intelligent and knowledgeable person would no attach his beliefs and knowledge in defending unproven arguments. Also, you must never be 100% set on something, we all make mistakes and we&#39;re all learning until we die. Always be willing to question others and yourself. This is a lost cause, move on buddy</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I cant write my sources, well i can but the process and time it took to get to the understanding i have now i will literally have to write a book. What i said is abstraction of years of research and filtering of miss information. </p>

<p>While if Trump has connections to Russia or not i can not say with confidence because I wasn&#39;t really interested in Trump before, and i am also not willing to take a stand on something i am not 100% sure.</p>

<p>I believe he did work with Russia to get some of his recent information. I think Wikileaks was the front of Russia and some Europeans leaders working to get Trump elected, not because i am sure Trump is legit but because i know Hillary is the puppet of the &quot;elites&quot; and if she was to get elected we were going for ww3.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s an honest answer? Although there&#39;s no law that requires it, presidential candidates release their tax returns in a show of good faith to the American people as a means of transparency. To show they have no conflicts that would impede the very crucial decisions they make and have our best interest always. We should know where the economic interests lie of those who are supposed to represent. We need to know if they are being honest about where their money comes from, and where their money is. We need to better understand their motivations for the policies that they support, so we can better determine what policies are truly in the public&#39;s best interest.</p>

<p>It&#39;s a fact that our intelligence agencies think Russia hacked us.  It&#39;s also a fact that after the briefing, Trump Admitted that Russia was &quot;probably&quot; behind the attack. </p>

<p>You really think Trump is going to get oil money from Russia? People think this a possibility?</p>

<p>Yes.  Unequivocally yes.  He has hidden his finances since day 1.  He has been one of the most secretive candidates we&#39;ve ever had.  Yet people voted for him for his &quot;transparency&quot;.</p>

<p>Russia is the one who hacked the emails and had them sent to Wikileaks.  They didn&#39;t forge votes, they hacked potentially damaging information about one party and intentionally did not hack the other party because Putin VERY CLEARLY had a favorite in this election. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Is that really all it takes? Someone handwaves away a bunch of sources without actually engaging with the content of the post?</p>

<p>Do people just come to this sub so they can be told what to believe?</p>

<p>You post this asking for some discussion and present a bunch of links from another user. I thought maybe you were looking for people to offer more/conflicting evidence, or to discuss the existing articles.</p>

<p>But all that happened is 1) Someone makes a blanket statement that all the sources are 100% untrustworthy and therefore everything should be dismissed, and 2) Someone lists some pro russian bullet points that barely relate to OP, with no actual links.</p>

<p>And your response is &quot;yes, thank you so much for the valuable input&quot;.</p>

<p>People say they come here &quot;looking for truth&quot;, but I see a lot of &quot;tell me what to think&quot;. People coming here like &quot;I support Trump, and am a little worried about X. Tell me why I shouldn&#39;t be worried about X&quot;. People looking for an echo chamber and getting one. It&#39;s a real irony.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not balls deep into <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>, I just like to lurk to see what people from all sides are talking about, but it&#39;s disturbing to see this kind of pattern. Obv there&#39;s a big influx of Trump supporters here, so it&#39;s extra important to not let a collective confirmation bias take hold. Please continue to follow stories like this.</p>

<p>There are ppl from both &quot;sides&quot; AFAICT, I&#39;m just saying the population looks like it&#39;s changing. Lots of new users, lots of people accusing each other of shilling because of new users, etc. ppl being dismissed just for discussing Trump/Russia, other people giving inane reasons or excuses for ignoring Trump issues, shit like that, idk... enough that I actually left a comment.</p>

<p>And ya ppl have been accusing each other of shilling since the beginning of time, but still. Worth mentioning for self awareness.</p>

<p>When it comes to Trump, almost every source has a strong bias against him for some reason, so much so that it&#39;s almost impossible to get any objective information about him.</p>

<p>So yes that&#39;s the problem. There&#39;s practically no one you can take seriously these days, when 6 corporations effectively own all media and all are establishment lapdogs. They&#39;re all propagandists with an agenda. And the bigger they are, the worse it is.</p>

All good things. In the end people see what they want to see. </p>

<p>As for answers, we&#39;ve had 50 years of secrecy and lies. This will be the MOST transparent Presidency ever as every move he makes will be scrutinized a million times over. His tax returns? Don&#39;t care. Mob connections?  Laughable. Bush, Clinton, Obama were dealers in war (assassins, drones, invasions) and supported regimes/countries that deny basic human rights to people, consider women second class citizens, and fund terrorism. And we are worried about mob ties or Russia? CLASSIC red herring. How could mob ties POSSIBLY be worse than the ACTUAL relationships these presidents have had?

    <div class="md"><p>Russia denies basic human rights, and has its own agenda to subvert its rivals and expand. </p>

<p>If we are to actually put America first, we need to understand our position in the world of 4d international chess. It was in our interest to align with Saudi Arabia. They only sold oils in dollars and we protected them. It is hard to explain how much the petrodollar has helped you, but know that other large powers did not like this. Sure Saudi Arabia treats people horribly, but it was a great deal for America. </p>

<p>But this puts me in an odd position because our relationship with Saudi Arabia was a mess before, they help us some areas and made a deal with radical Wahhabism for the king to stay in power. </p>

<p>We really do not share the same strategic objectives as Russia. There were areas we had to work with them, and the previous administrations did not think very carefully about what tricks they had up their sleeve if we pushed them into a corner. </p>

<p>Economically they are not very important to us, we don&#39;t have much need to trade with them, and basically the country is run for the personal financial benefit of Putin and his cronies. We don&#39;t need their oil, Europe does through the pipeline. We wanted to go around them and cut them out. </p>

<p>Stability on the world order was a good thing for America because we set up the global system to unfairly help us. Having the Middle East a mess helped keep the price of oil low. If they didn&#39;t fight and really united they would nationalize industry and harmUS multinationals. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t mean to defend the status quo too much, because there was much to criticize. </p>

<p>Russia is not really a friend in fighting radical Islam. And within Islam there is a civil war on about 100 fronts. It is a quagmire that will take generations to resolve. We mostly need to move beyond oil and focus on the future. Once we do that we can cut the saudis loose. </p>

<p>So sure I&#39;d rather live in Russia over SA but when it comes to us power, we had good reasons for the old way. I&#39;m not seeing good reasons to buddy up to Putin. And with the stunt he pulled to hack us, we are in a whole new world. Some things just weren&#39;t done in the past because they didn&#39;t think they&#39;d get away with it. </p>

<p>Do you not see your hypocrisy here? It&#39;s &quot;a good deal&quot; for us because of oil and you&#39;re willing to look the other way, but you want transparency on tax returns and hypothetical mob ties presumably because of some ethical rationale? Moreover, you yourself admit Russia doesn&#39;t mean anything to us economically or strategically yet we need to investigate Trump for his ties because it is of paramount to our national security? </p>

<p>The contortions anti-Trump folks go through never cease to amaze me. It&#39;s time to realize the red herrings for what they are. And by the way ... where did all the warmongering and hysteria in the press around Syria go? Amazing how that all disappeared once Obama left and Clinton lost. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The relationship with SA was bipartisan and in the us strategic interest. I am trying to be more descriptive, personally I&#39;ve thought we needed to rethink our relationship with SA for a while, Iran is actually a population of young people who we have more in common with. The Shia Sunni civil war is complicated and we should avoid taking any side, and use them when it serves us. Basic realpolitik. </p>

<p>What I meant is that we have real allies who help us, The EU and Australia, and it makes no sense to trade those allies for Russia. Russia presents some real threats to our interest. They want to take back as much of the Soviet Union into their sphere of influence as possible. They have very advanced propaganda techniques. </p>

<p>My primary concern is not about ethics, it is strategic. I worry that we have lost significant national power. When you own the China shop I don&#39;t see how it helps you to be a bull. </p>

<p>A leader compromised by issues that violate the ethical norms of that society is a weak leader. The deal we made with the Saudi devil was transparent. I don&#39;t like it, and I feel a concentrated investment in green energy instead of subsidies to fossil fuel special interest could have lead us to move beyond oil as the primary geostrategic  concern. The Wars of the 20th century were fought over oil, and the winners need it. </p>

<p>But honestly it is far more complicated than I am able to describe here, and yes putting America first does make us hypocrites, because the art of diplomacy is making deals that serve you. </p>

<p>Right now we have no definitive evidence. I do not know how becoming more friendly to Russia is in our interest. Good relations should never be the object of diplomacy. Good relations are good because both sides are getting something out of it. </p>

<p>Putin was in a very weak position, which did create other risks, he was being forced to show his strong arm too much, which united many forces against him. I don&#39;t know what the us gets by removing sanctions. I worry our friends and allies will no longer trust us with the soft power we previously had. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Our allies have little choice in anything. You think Germany or Denmark is going to run to our rescue? Where are they going to go? UK did something called Bexit themselves. Italy and France leaving EU soon too. You&#39;d prefer a China-Russia alliance? Seems foolish. Eight years of EU-Obama love fest didn&#39;t amount to much. Low economic growth, war and more war, increase in terrorism. </p>

<p>Trump&#39;s not a weak leader. It&#39;s the opposite. Change is hard. You&#39;ve got to break eggs, rip off band-aids, some people aren&#39;t going to like it. What I see are illy tantrums over visas and crowd sizes and words. Truth is dems have almost no power. Whipping up media frenzy is the only thing they have left ... they know this and Trump knows this and is exploiting it. The more he is in the news the better.   </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The EU was a bulwark against Russian aggression. They want to divide Europe so they can eat it piece by piece, divided yes even Germany will be held hostage or frozen in winter when Russia shuts off the gas like they did to Ukraine. A united Europe is in America&#39;s interest, divided they fall to the manipulations of our adversaries. </p>

<p>Yes Russia&#39;s divide and conquer strategy by using a whole new age of psychological warfare on the hearts and minds of foreign populations has been tremendously effective. </p>

<p>Winning election is like picking up a girl at a bar, governing is like marriage and child rearing. A master pick up artist is not the same thing as an excellent husband and father. Yes, the GOP has all the power in the system. What are they doing with it? What is the end game? Why is it a good thing? </p>

<p>Was not the tea party and birtherism a demonstration of the weakness of Obama? How does everything you say not apply to conservatives in 2009? </p>

<p>Being in the news is great when you are running for president. When you are president of the United States when you take a shit it&#39;s news. Everything he does is news. This country is divided, a great leader unites. </p>

<p>I just have to note how odd it is to me that you describe his opponents as the ones having &quot;tantrums.&quot; </p>

<p>At this point I just don&#39;t know what world events would alter your chosen reality. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Afraid of Russia are we? Swallowing the lefts narrative hook line and sinker. I don&#39;t love Trump or the GOP but hopefully this is the death of identity politics and political correctness which is so awful for society. We are overdo for real debate on a whole host of issues.  I agree on 2009 ... it&#39;s the exact same thing just the Dems are on the outside looking in. The rage is palpable.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t think the &quot;tantrums &quot; statement its odd at all. You and I don&#39;t see him the same way at all. You see a childish narcissist because you consume MSM  and are conditioned to this. It was the same playbook (condescension and derision) with Palin and Romney and the Teaparty.  I see something else entirely. I see a master manipulator deeply skilled in media relations that knows exactly what the MSM playbook is. The MSM will never let him be Presidential so is taking the fight to them.</p>

<p>For what its worth I am a believer in Assange. If Trump just continues Obamas wars he loses the benefit of the doubt from me. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have always said Trump is an expert at what he does, which is market himself. My point is that his genius is a very limited skill set that is perfect for the media environment, but that is not even close to the skill set needed to be a great leader. I would describe Hillary and Obama as manager types, not the leaders we need. We have a leadership crisis. </p>

<p>As for my personal bias, I can only assure you that I have held basically the same opinion of Trump I currently hold since 2006. I have always had a personal disdain for his business based on marketing rather than building real value. </p>

<p>If there is a bright side to this debacle, it is that we are giving him and his supporters all the role in the world. If we hang, there are no excuses. He has all the power anyone could want to enact his agenda. </p>

<p>I used to believe in Assange, but Obama called his bluff and destroyed the last remaining credibility in my mind. He is a man with his own agenda, which is not transparency. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah well you seem nice enough but its clear where you get your info. I think if you&#39;d read Wikileaks in any detail, read Assange&#39;s books, or watched any of his talks over the years there is absolutely no way you could have this perspective. Feel sorry for you actually ... but everyone is entitled to their opinion. </p>

<p>Hillary and Obama (and Bushes) are essentially mass murderers. The US has been in perpetual war for almost 30 years. We export billions in weapons whose only purpose is death. We&#39;ve raped and destroyed country after country, pilfering oil and gold. You are incredibly naive if you think those two were &quot;manager&quot; types. What you see is almost entirely fake. It&#39;s all produced for your consumption ... Trump is just a different show for a different audience. It&#39;s going to be a long and lonely few years for you.      </p>

    <div class="md"><p>If Assange released info on Russians it would go a long way to show me he was an equal opportunity releaser. He talks the talk, but I&#39;m not seeing him walk the walk. </p>

<p>All presidents since at least FDR have been mass murderers. The national security state enforces the status quo. But the status quo has benefitted me. Around 2002 I was a huge Wall advocate, and felt for years that a populist revolution was needed. Unfortunately I don&#39;t think trump is actually serving his audience. The message he sold is not the same as the agenda he is pushing. </p>

<p>The right way to help the people who elected him would be to attack the oil and gas industry and create a new green public works job program.  </p>

<p>I think you will be very disappointed in Trump. The tactics that won him the election are not the tactics needed to secure his brand of authoritarianism. If he had smarter people around he would be more dangerous. The smart way to trigger the non &quot;Muslim ban&quot; would be after an attack. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t think Assange owes you or the democrats proof of anything. What&#39;s stupid is you folks totally ignore the content preferring to instead focus on the messenger. If you focused on the content, on the democrat&#39;s OWN WORDS, and see how dispicable they were you wouldn&#39;t care if it was Russia or Donald Duck. Educate yourself : <a href="https://wikileaks.org/-Leaks-.html">https://wikileaks.org/-Leaks-.html</a></p>

<p>And like I said, I don&#39;t actually care much about Trump.  I am however thrilled the Democratic machine in ashes. Despicable party. Ruling elites and the very poor they rule over. Run by rich white men and women preying on minorities sensibilities so they can stay in power. Screaming racism and sexism at every turn while exploiting the very same identity politics and class hatred the so perfectly exemplify.  It&#39;s dirty and shameful. But they own the press so we never question it.</p>

<p>I think Trump has shrewder people around him than Obama did ... which was how he got elected. I also think he&#39;s way further ahead than people  fathom. It&#39;s the naive masses that take things at face value. A couple weeks in he already gets to claim he&#39;s fulfilled all his campaign promises. The &quot;Muslim&quot; ban? They knew the left would howl no matter what so they went straight for jugular. It&#39;s crazy bold. He&#39;s forcing courts to sort out the details,  forcing both the left and the right to show their cards, he has the initiative which, if you know anything about strategy, is where you want to be. Force other to react to you. The left can pretend all they want, can mock all they want, but in the end he will act (for good or bad) and they are powerless . Riots and protests and that&#39;s all they got. When the mid-terms come around and it gets even more republican the left will be going wtf even more. They are missing things entirely, preferring to believe they are the enlightened ones. One big echo chamber where they turn on TV daily to confirm their beliefs and go on their merry way.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Believe it or not Russia should have been our #1 ally. If you carefully look at the last couple decades Russia made great efforts towards creating a good relationship with the US and promoting word peace, but the US puppet gov has been manipulating people in thinking they are a threat to us and waging sanctions and war against them so a handful of globalists can benefit and keep people enslaved. Putin has 80+ approval ratings from the Russian people and he sometimes did try to expose the globalist agenda but was threatened for extinction along with his countrymen. Russia is controlled by the globalists and Putin is just a powerless man trying to do the best given the current situations. </p>

<ul>
<li>Putin asked to be become a member of NATO - US refused.</li>
<li>Putin threatened to expose the global agenda - US put sanctions and threatened war</li>
<li>Putin tried to dump oil into the market which would have caused economic prosperity on the planet and dirt cheap oil - US sanctions and global oil regulatory agency refused and even limited the Russian oil export keeping high oil prices and economic control.</li>
<li>Putin exposed government manipulation and human enslavement - US sanctions and the news barely made it out of Russia even though Putin hold conference meetings with all the major news channels on the planet </li>
<li>Putin offered cooperation and willingness toward the US government - US refused to hear him and refused cooperation for at least 15 years now </li>
</ul>

<p>After ww2 a deal was made with the Soviet Union and the USA. The NATO keeps distance and threats away from Russia and Russia will pull back from Germany and Europe. Also this agreement said that nuclear would not be produced. Since then NATO grew by I think 9 countries that surround Russia and even tried to include Ukraine which is literally next to Russia, we all know what happened.</p>

<p>The examples go on forever. I&#39;m not saying he is an angel, but he sure is a better leader from anyone we had in the US the last couple decades.</p>

<p>Its not as simple as that and many historical events and gov actions played a secret part on how we ended up in this situation.</p>

<p>Note: Recently Democrats accused Russia for election interference, and they might be right. My opinion this was a global effort involving multiple countries as an effort to prevent ww3 and give the true reality to the American people. </p>

<p>Next time you see the media and politic puppets complain ask yourself &quot;Is the person responsible showing the truth to blame or the actual parties involved in conspiring against the people resulting in human enslavement so a handful of globalists can live like gods?&quot; Personally do you want to know the truth or to live under false reality?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well I would suggest turning off CNN, Fox and any other news channel on tv and start digging in the web for knowledge from normal Joes and independent reporters. Its all a big deception and technically we&#39;re all slaves fed the illusion of democracy. Personally I think the last US president who was for the people was JFK. The month of his assassination he signed an executive order that was the first step on giving freedom to the people. He tried to cut out the central banks and give the power back to the people by issuing silver backed tbills. Weeks later he was killed and 5 months the law was canceled.  </p>

<p>I mean when you start understanding what is really going on you will get depressed. All human on planet Earth can live a peaceful and prosperous life. All those problems you hear in the news all day are straight nonsense. Earth has unlimited resources so everyone can live like a king, but the current kings don&#39;t want that. Ww2 was a setup, 9/11 setup, Afghanistan, Iran, Syria etc all are fake setups.</p>

<p>Year 2000: 7 countries having independent central banks.
1) Afghanistan
2) Iran
3) Sudan
4) Libya
5) Cuba
6) North Korea
7) Iran</p>

<p>I won&#39;t point out the meaning, look at the names and I know you understand what i mean.</p>

<p>Year 2011: 3 countries not having a Rothschild controlled central bank
1) Cuba
2) North Korea
3) Iran</p>

<p>How cool is that fact??? The whole and deception is so deep that is mind blowing. But know this, we&#39;re all slaves now. </p>

<p>I would also suggest reading the founding fathers and old president papers, they knew exactly what was going on and where we&#39;re going, they even warned us but no one has the time to read anything anymore. Some even went to depression of the reality and apologized of what took place during their presidency for destroying the country and enslaving the people. Some did fight really hard for the people, it now is the hidden history of human civilization and the grow/fall of the USA. At one point in history the US was leading the way for global peace and prosperity, but then it was taken over and leaded to its own distraction so the &quot;kings&quot; can stay kings of the planet.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Some food for thought from some of the best and most honest presidents that ever lived in the USA.</p>

<p>“There was abundance in the Colonies, and peace was reigning on every border. It was difficult, and even impossible, to find a happier and more prosperous nation on all the surface of the globe. Comfort was prevailing in every home. The people, in general, kept the highest moral standards, and education was widely spread.”  - Benjamin Franklin</p>

<p>“We have no poor houses in the Colonies; and if we had some, there would be nobody to put in them, since there is, in the Colonies, not a single unemployed person, neither beggars nor tramps.”  - Benjamin Franklin</p>

<p>“That is simple. In the Colonies, we issue our own paper money. It is called ‘Colonial Scrip.’ We issue it in proper proportion to make the goods and pass easily from the producers to the consumers. In this manner, creating ourselves our own paper money, we control its purchasing power and we have no interest to pay to no one.”  - Benjamin Franklin</p>

<p>-----Soon afterward, the English bankers demanded that the King and Parliament pass a law that prohibited the colonies from using their scrip money.  Only gold and silver could be used which would be provided by the English bankers.  This began the plague of debt based money in the colonies that had cursed the English working class.</p>

<p>The first law was passed in 1751, and then a harsher law was passed in 1763.  Franklin claimed that within one year, the colonies were filled with unemployment and beggars, just like in England, because there was not enough money to pay for the goods and work. The money supply had been cut in half.-----</p>

<p>&quot;I believe that banking institutions are more dangerous to our liberties than standing armies. Already they have raised up a monied aristocracy that has set the government at defiance. The issuing power (of money) should be taken away from the banks and restored to the people to whom it properly belongs.&quot;  - Thomas Jefferson</p>

<p>History records that the money changers have used every form of abuse, intrigue, deceit, and violent means possible to maintain their control over governments by controlling the money and its issuance.  - James Madison</p>

<p>“Banks have done more injury to the religion, morality, tranquility, prosperity, and even wealth of the nation than they can have done or ever will do good.”  - John Adams</p>

<p>All the perplexities confusion and distress in America arise not from defects of the Constitution, not from want of honor or virtue, so much as from downright ignorance of the nature of coin, credit and circulation.</p>

<p>I see in the near future a crisis approaching that unnerves me and cause me to tremble for safety of my country; corporations have been enthroned, an era of corruption in High Places will follow, and the Money Power of the country will endeavor to prolong its reign by working upon the prejudices of the People, until the wealth is aggregated in a few hands, and the Republic destroyed. - A Lincoln</p>

<p>“If the American people ever allow private banks to control the issue of their currency, first by inflation, then by deflation, the banks…will deprive the people of all property until their children wake-up homeless on the continent their fathers conquered…. The issuing power should be taken from the banks and restored to the people, to whom it properly belongs.” – Thomas Jefferson</p>

<p>“The Government should create, issue, and circulate all the currency and credits needed to satisfy the spending power of the Government and the buying power of consumers. By the adoption of these principles, the taxpayers will be saved immense sums of interest. Money will cease to be master and become the servant of humanity.” -Abraham Lincoln</p>

<p>Despite these warnings, Woodrow Wilson signed the 1913 Federal Reserve Act. A few years later he wrote: “I am a most unhappy man. I have unwittingly ruined my country. A great industrial nation is controlled by its system of credit. Our system of credit is concentrated. The growth of the nation, therefore, and all our activities are in the hands of a few men. We have come to be one of the worst ruled, one of the most completely controlled and dominated Governments in the civilized world no longer a Government by free opinion, no longer a Government by conviction and the vote of the majority, but a Government by the opinion and duress of a small group of dominant men.” -Woodrow Wilson</p>

<p>“When a government is dependent upon bankers for money, they and not the leaders of the government control the situation, since the hand that gives is above the hand that takes… Money has no motherland; financiers are without patriotism and without decency; their sole object is gain.” – Napoleon Bonaparte, Emperor of France, 1815</p>

<p>“The death of Lincoln was a disaster for Christendom. There was no man in the United States great enough to wear his boots and the bankers went anew to grab the riches. I fear that foreign bankers with their craftiness and tortuous tricks will entirely control the exuberant riches of America and use it to systematically corrupt civilization.” Otto von Bismark (1815-1898), German Chancellor, after the Lincoln assassination</p>

<p>“Money plays the largest part in determining the course of history.” Karl Marx writing in the Communist Manifesto (1848).</p>

<p>“That this House considers that the continued issue of all the means of exchange – be they coin, bank-notes or credit, largely passed on by cheques – by private firms as an interest-bearing debt against the public should cease forthwith; that the Sovereign power and duty of issuing money in all forms should be returned to the Crown, then to be put into circulation free of all debt and interest obligations…” Captain Henry Kerby MP, in an Early Day Motion tabled in 1964.</p>

<p>“Banks lend by creating credit. They create the means of payment out of nothing. ” Ralph M Hawtry, former Secretary to the Treasury.</p>

<p>“… our whole monetary system is dishonest, as it is debt-based… We did not vote for it. It grew upon us gradually but markedly since 1971 when the commodity-based system was abandoned.” The Earl of Caithness, in a speech to the House of Lords, 1997.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So there is no valid true source you can go and know you&#39;re getting the truth, i do know an excellent book that describes the true history of money, but id does cover the recent modern economy, then i know some old documentaries that kinda do a good job. But there&#39;s many fake and manipulated books and documentaries that are put out there just to manipulate, confuse and discredit reality so be careful, always verify. Personally i probably went through hundreds of information, i then had to find a way to clean up the mess so I started writing down only what i was 100% sure is the truth, not even including facts i was 90% sure just in case. Eventually it grows on you and you kinda get good filtering out the propaganda. I will write down the names of the books for you when i go home, i dont remember the names on top of my head.</p>

<p>This sub is called <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> </p>

<p>And yet this post only has ~20 comments, only 100 votes, and is heavily being downvoted.</p>

<p>Why?</p>

<p>Because it&#39;s about Trump. </p>

<p>As I type this comment there&#39;s a thread about pizzagate made a few hours ago that has 630 votes and more comments.</p>

<p>The partisan bias is so blatant I&#39;m not sure how anyone can deny it</p>

<p>Feinberg owns Cerberus. <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerberus_Capital_Management%20http://i.imgur.com/5HdPg7b.jpg">Cerberus owns dyncorp.</a></p>

<p><a href="https://youtu.be/xTJe3F9zmvg">Dyncorp trafficks children.</a></p>

<p>So trump has had several pedo island visits and his top advisor is THE guy who sets up brownstone operations. </p>

<p>In case you don&#39;t know, brownstone is the killing of children. They do it on a sacrificial stone, they shit their pants when they die. BROWNSTONE.</p>

<p>While they don&#39;t still kill them as offerings on stones, the name stuck.</p>

<p>On to Steven Feinberg. He own dyncorp as established above. Dyncorp is the CIAs hand that gets the children and takes pics of them with politicians and cops, ducking.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I am not familiar of the recent events concerning Trump but i know some cook history about oil, corruption and Russia. So again, i am not connecting anything here, just feeding information and maybe people would be able to make connections. </p>

<p>So its really deep and complicated but i will try my best to point out the most important info.</p>

<p>Russia has huge oils reserves that is restricted to take out and sell by the big &quot;gang&quot; that controls humanity. A big reason the US gov and media push the hatred against Russia has a lot to do with Russias ability to provide oil to Europe in which will ultimately only hurt the &quot;gang&quot;. So by keeping Russia  as an enemy they are able to push sanctions and so on. Currently the biggest supplier of oil in that part of the planet is S Arabia. The issue here though is that we say S Arabia but in reality is just a family that controls all the oil. The name of the company is Aramco and its financials are hidden because its privates. BUT, the history of how it came to be and who controls it goes really back in time that you can trace it to the USA and Standard oil. By controlling the oil they control human survival, and some of the recent wars are in fact the actions taken to keep this going. Now when it comes to Russia people don&#39;t understand that most if the things they know about Russia and hate them for it is actually lies and propaganda. This election was not about electing a US president, it was preventing ww3. Hillary was going to finish up the &quot;gang&quot; plan and global leaders which one of them was Putin warned publicly that the global &quot;gang&quot; was playing the last move and they will fight against it even if it means ww3. The leaks in my opinion came from Russia and other Europeans countries were some people tried for a last time to wake the people up. They had global conference meetings with news organizations before the election but the media around the world refused to inform people, so the information had to come to the people one way or another.</p>

<p>In my view Russia is not the enemy. Even though its banking system is controlled by the &quot;gang&quot; Putin is not. </p>
