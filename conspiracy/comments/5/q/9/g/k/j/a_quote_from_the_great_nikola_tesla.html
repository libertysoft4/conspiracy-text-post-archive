Earth would be more easily defined as a system environment. Earth is also a machine, it is a Tesla coil. The sun and moon are powered wirelessly with the electromagnetic field (the Aether). This field also suspends the celestial spheres with electo-magnetic levitation. Electromag levitation disproves gravity because the only force you need to counter is the electromagnetic force, not gravity. The stars are attached to the firmament&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not semantics homie. Calling a theory &quot;Flat Earth&quot; when you want it to encompass far more than the name suggests just turns people away from the part of the discussion that actually makes sense. It would be like me trying to explain relativity to someone and calling the theory the &quot;Pancakes Steal Your Socks&quot; Theory. </p>

<p>A bit of an exaggeration, but I honestly hope you can see what I&#39;m talking about. I want to promote healthy, rational discussion in this community and to those who aren&#39;t yet a part of it. Names like this just promote disinformation and a less-than-sane narrative for people who are being introduced to conspiracies. </p>

<p>TLDR; Flat Earth theory is a very poor name if the pertinent content has nothing to do with the Earth being flat.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think we citizens haven&#39;t been allowed to study the moon enough for me to present a solid theory about it. I find the tidal lock fascinating, as well as how perfectly it lines up with our sun during eclipses. I also find it interesting that there has been so much effort to cover up information about the far side of the moon, as well as the blurring of pictures taken by Nasa. There&#39;s a lot there and I can consider many interesting theories but I&#39;m not sticking by any of them until I have more proof. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>To you and your limited interaction with the cosmos, the earth might as well be flat, do you look up at the sky and study the motions of the stars, observe the alignments of the planets.

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m actually mildly obsessed with the universe. I have a personal telescope, have read the works of a few great astronomers, and of all my friends am the only one who ever takes the time to look up and just take it all in. I do study the movements of heavenly bodies, try to point out which direction certain constellations should lie to my girlfriend, and more than you&#39;d think. I don&#39;t know why you&#39;re being so hostile. </p>

<p>I may have a limited interaction with the universe, just as everyone else does, but don&#39;t for a second believe I don&#39;t think about it. You don&#39;t know me or what I do. The point of this is raising awareness to things that <em>actually</em>need to be made aware of. Not some petty anti-scientific garbage theory that everything you&#39;ve just listed discredits. Please take a step back and realize which conspiracies you&#39;re wasting your time with and those that need attention.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What theory proves a round earth, or a torus earth, or a bubble earth or a hollow earth? There is no proof, there&#39;s evidence, there&#39;s a person&#39;s point of view. Ultimately it&#39;s your meat sensors that tell you what this world is, and all the sensors can do is send a signal. You make sense of that signal by comparing it to what you&#39;ve already experienced. We all live in alternative realities, except each alternative reality creates it&#39;s own alternative facts.</p>

<p>Flat Earthers are a reactive neurosis of people that want to erradicate their reality of confinement. To them they want verification that their world isn&#39;t a flat plane with a dome, they want to break through their metaphorical firmament. Just as the bible is filled with metaphors that people interpret as solid reality.</p>

<p>People&#39;s concepts amount to little more than a finger pointing to something. Just like you don&#39;t buy everything being sold, you don&#39;t have to look at what everyone is pointing at. You can agree that some people are pointing in the right direction, but don&#39;t lash out at people that point in another direction no matter how misguided it seems to you.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I like this question a lot. What if you control it? Or me? Or all of us together. I try hard to remove myself from the skin and bones.  We all know we are more than skin and bones. There is something inside us all that represents us...I&#39;ll call it a soul,  you can call it whatever you&#39;d like.  Point being is our soul bound to our skin and bones (our mind) or are we free to explore everything? Can our soul move through the 4th dimension? Have other souls already accomplished this? Or are we literally skin and bones and our soul was just a bunch of chemicals...
So many thoughts that come with your question</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The matrix projects almost all of reality for you. Lets say you walk out of one room to go enter another. You leave room 1. The Matrix then projects or renders that Holographic Image of the Hallway or Room 2 that you are going towards. They are Holographic Images and only exist when projected. The Matrix basically makes decisions for people with low conscious awareness. We forgot this was all an illusion and began to believe everything around us, and so called &quot;matter&quot; to be real, with an independent existence. In true reality Cause and Effect are illusions. But they appear very real here because the Matrix can only project in Linear Motion. we have become enslaved by a Computer Program. By raising the human vibrational level and level of consciousness one can then &quot;Self Project&quot; reality. Basically it is overriding the Matrix Program and literally Remote Influencing/Outpicturing your own reality.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>As long as you identify with a Physical Body and a Physical Dimension you have to address what you put into the Body/Avatar. Non Fluoride Water and a Vegetarian Diet cause significant increase in Vibratory Rate. Dense foods such as red meat are of a very low vibration and actually absorb the energy of &quot;fear&quot; from the slaughtered animal. I am not a doctor and not telling someone how to live but meats vibrate significantly lower and denser than spinach for example. Mediation and Relaxed Deep Thought are crucial. Visualize your expected coming events in the Minds Eye beforehand. The following takes enormous effort and I am not claiming I can do this on a regular basis. Doing any of this is exceptionately difficult: At a certain point you will want to start trying &quot;Project&quot; images in your Holographic Sphere (your perceived reality). Do you try to hit your hand with a hammer? Absolutely not. The rules of the Matrix still apply until you are in control, and in a way a &quot;Master&quot;. Start small; roll a tennis ball on the floor. See which direction you want it to actually roll. You &quot;see&quot; this in your head while at the same time looking at it. The version you &quot;see in your mind&quot; is another reality. The objective is to overlap the desired direction or reality with the one being projected by the matrix. This is a &quot;Dimensional Overlay&quot;. You are merging 2 realities together by thought until you are outpicturing the dominant projection. Wim Hof can jump in a lake of Polar Ice and be completely warm. He does this by controlling his entire body by thought. Yogi&#39;s and Tibetan Masters did the same. The only thing that actually exists is thought. Does that mean I can drop a chair on my foot? No. Of course not. As long as the matrix projects my reality the Laws of a Physics apply. Do some Yogis and Tibetan masters break the laws of physics from time to time. Yes</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Newton discovered how the solar system worked and his equations described how the force of gravity might be holding everything in orbit...but there was no physical object causing any of it. Only the math predicted the correct answers. So he knew the &#39;how&#39; but not the &#39;why&#39;, and it stumped everyone for a few hundred years: </p>

<blockquote>
<p>It is inconceivable that inanimate Matter should, without the Mediation of something else, which is not material, operate upon, and affect other matter without mutual Contact…That Gravity should be innate, inherent and essential to Matter, so that one body may act upon another at a distance thro&#39; a Vacuum, without the Mediation of any thing else, by and through which their Action and Force may be conveyed from one to another, is to me so great an Absurdity that I believe no Man who has in philosophical Matters a competent Faculty of thinking can ever fall into it. Gravity must be caused by an Agent acting constantly according to certain laws; but whether this Agent be material or immaterial, I have left to the Consideration of my readers. - Isaac Newton</p>
</blockquote>

<p>He is talking about gravity. Action at a distance. That one material body in space may have an effect on another with no material in between them. This was a great concern for scientists, because their only answer to the &#39;why&#39; was that &#39;the math makes it happen&#39;. This is of course an absurd answer, but it was all they had. Math is not a physical object. It&#39;s just the logic of quantity. Logic is abstract. Saying the math makes the planets stay in orbit is logically equivalent to saying angels make them move. Indeed some people (probably laypeople) did say things like that for a long time. To many, he was basically confirming the Aristotlean view that angels made the planets move. You might have called them &quot;gravitational woo&quot; theories. Eventually scientists got fed up with it, and a new physical model was invented. </p>

<p>It began with Michael Faraday in the early 1800&#39;s with his description of electromagnetism as being caused by &#39;lines of force&#39;. A line of force is nothing more than an imaginary line connecting an object that is creating a magnetic force to an object that is being affected by that force. He suggested that this line of force be considered &#39;physical&#39;, thereby connecting the actual physical objects in space <strong>as if</strong> there were some kind of invisible string between them. Later James Maxwell developed this idea further and refined it into a full fledged theory, which came to me known as field theory. Under this model there aren&#39;t really &#39;lines of force&#39; but a &#39;sphere of influence&#39; that is described by an equation or set of equations like the inverse square law and force per unit charge, and this sphere of influence is assumed to be a real physical object even though it cannot be directly measured like every other real physical object can be measured. At first a lot of people did not agree with the lines of force or field theory, because they understood that logically they are the equivalent of what Newtonian physics said, that &#39;the math makes things move&#39;. Eventually though, since nobody had a better explanation, force fields were considered real physical objects by almost everyone. They were the best physical explanation that science had. So they stuck with it. They now believe in it. </p>

Compare the pictures of the ET he shares with <a href="https://www.metabunk.org/attachments/fark_okqyi-4il8cnabgii_we1qz14sc-jpg.9909/">this toy alien.</a> They look identical, and this has been used as evidence against him to discredit everything he discloses. I highly doubt the people working in Deep Underground Military Bases (DUMBs) such as Area 51 (more accurately referred to as the Groom Lake facility or Nellus Air Force Base) are able to take and leak photographs of whatever stuff their working on without raising suspicion and risk losing their careers and being charged and perhaps executed for treason. However, I do feel that he does share some legitimate information about ETs, ET craft and whatnot in that interview, but the pictures of the ET are fake, or, the toys were based on actual ETs so as the two would be misconstrued in the event of that photos of them are leaked to the public (which seems like a less plausible explanation in my opinion).</p>

<p>Yeah, it&#39;s a fascinating watch. I&#39;d love for someone else to publicly share the results of the experiment he claims to have done in which he tapes two magnets together, same poles facing each other, and drops it from a tall building, and it falls slower than it should due to gravity. I asked a friend with a PhD in plasma physics, and he said that shouldn&#39;t happen. It&#39;s such a simple experiment to do too, and it would be definite proof of concept.</p>

Light, gravity, magnetism are effects of electromagnetic force being propated in different quallitative states trough aether (such as water/ice/gas).
Electric current is not a current of electrons trough a medium as &quot;carrier&quot; of the negative charge. Negative charge is an oxymoron, a logical fallacy. Negative &quot;charge&quot; is a DISCHARGE. It is a release of charge, it is an opposite of a particle.</p>

<p>In that regard, modern physics shot itself in the foot concluding that forces they were unable to find the causes for are standalone forces (magnetism, gravity). Tesla ridiculed Einsteins idea of particle physics, relativity, space-time grid and was a proponent of existence of aether.</p>

<p>What is different in a piece of rock that was made from normal to magnetic? Its physical attributes are exactly the same as before it was made magnetic. You changed its qualitative attributes, as in, its effect on aether.</p>

<p>Why is light on the edges of the edges of the spectre so strong it will kill you? What is different in its quallitative attributes from normal light?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Why do galaxies rotate at much faster rates than we would infer from the light we receive? The current explanation is &quot;dark matter&quot; (ie GR works, its just that we cant see the hidden mass causing the observed velocities), and yet all of our attempts to find different candidates for dark matter have failed. </p>

<p>Why are heavenly bodies receding from our location at larger speeds the farther away they are from us? The current explanation is &quot;dark energy&quot; is causing spacetime itself to expand like the surface of an inflating balloon, but we have no idea what this dark energy is and our attempts to describe it using quantum theory have failed. </p>

<p>So in other words, we claim GR is the end all - be all of theories because it super accurately describes the motions of our satellites and the motions of planets around the sun, but wherever it fails we cover it up with ad-hoc &quot;mysterious&quot; particles and energy whose origin we cannot explain. We also conveniently ignore the fact that all attempts to unify it with our microscopic theory (the Standard Model) have failed. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The most promising theory I have read about so far is Reciprocal System theory: <a href="http://reciprocalsystem.org/">http://reciprocalsystem.org/</a></p>

<p>This theory was developed by Dewey Larson back in the 50s. In the 70s he released a three volume set of books that goes into the theory in depth and he shows how to calculate the masses of all the fundamental particles, the massess of the elements, interatomic distances, deflection of light due to gravity, critical temperatures of various substances, and many other physical quantities all from first principles with no recourse to ad-hoc physical constants. These volumes are called <a href="http://reciprocalsystem.org/PDFa/Nothing%20But%20Motion%20(Larson,%20Dewey%20B).pdf">Nothing But Motion</a>, <a href="http://reciprocalsystem.org/PDFa/Basic%20Properties%20of%20Matter%20(Larson,%20Dewey%20B).pdf">Basic Properties of Matter</a>, and <a href="http://reciprocalsystem.org/PDFa/Universe%20of%20Motion%20(Larson,%20Dewey%20B).pdf">Universe of Motion</a>. </p>

<p>The basic idea is that instead of having particles exist in spacetime, you just have motion, and space and time are reciprocal aspects of each other, creating motion. Linear motion is the photon, rotational motion creates the particles. Using these principles plus basic mathematics he accurately calculates a host of physical quantities, such as the masses of the particles. In the Standard Model these masses are measured and are part of the vast number of constants used to define the theory, and you see articles on wikipedia wondering what this mysterious theory that can explain the masses of the particles may be. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dimensionless_physical_constant">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dimensionless_physical_constant</a> Turns out its existed for over 50 years, its just scientists are too stubborn to give up on their idea of the Rutherford atom to look outside of their self imposed box.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I remember reading about Dewey Larson a number of years ago. I think Isaac Asimov said his theories were brilliant but a major flaw was the inability to explain the photoelectric effect. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>As Asimov wrote (in Chemical &amp; Engineering News, July 29, 1963):</p>

<p>&quot;If no electrons exist within the atom, as Larson suggests, I do not see how the photoelectric effect can be explained. From this I conclude that however stimulating Larson’s book might be as an intellectual exercise, it need not be taken seriously as anything more than that.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This got me &quot;Our senses enable us to perceive only a minute portion of the outside world. Our hearing extends to a small distance. Our sight is impeded by intervening bodies and shadows. To know each other we must reach beyond the sphere of our sense perceptions. We must transmit our intelligence, travel, transport the materials and transfer the energies necessary for our existence. Following this thought we now realize, forcibly enough to dispense with argument, that of all other conquests of man, without exception, that which is most desirable, which would be most helpful in the establishment of universal peaceful relations is — the complete ANNIHILATION OF DISTANCE&quot; --------Admiral Bryd who explored Antarctica alluded (I believe) to the fact that the way we perceive distance is wrong.  Could this really be a conspiracy....Is it that important to make us feel small and that space is expanding and that we are becoming smaller and smaller in a place that is getting bigger and bigger...We are going to wrong way, is it an intentional play by TPTB?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, the hangup for me with physical teleportation is that a person is not just a person, a person is a collective of billions of molecules, all of which would need to by synced perfectly at origin and re-synced perfectly at destination. It seems cumbersome and dangerous, when the alternative is to efficiently send only the necessary information while not risking the physical body. It&#39;s kind of like the benefits of digital music vs analog, over time the physical media will degrade, while the digital is infinitely replicable.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My thoughts are you are a good stimulant of this community.  Keep it up!</p>

<p>To the topic: I believe meditation, astral projection, and increasing personal frequency (love eliminating fear response) will allow better control of our pineal gland which possibly accesses the electromagnetic world.  If we are able to figure out how to harness the energy I like to believe what you are asking would be accomplished.  </p>

<p>Nostradamus predicted the event of the great genius figuring it out.  (Couldn&#39;t find a good source.  It&#39;s out there.)</p>

<p>I&#39;ve come across a YouTube video that I believe isn&#39;t faked about &quot;the electric eel man&quot;. <a href="https://youtu.be/Vnq-nNGvRe8">https://youtu.be/Vnq-nNGvRe8</a></p>

<p>He supposedly uses chi energy and lit paper on fire with his hands by balancing his positive and negative energy (yin/yang, love/fear) in his gut chakra.</p>

<p>For some reason my intuition ties all of this to holofractal (r/holofractal) theories about energy, Pythagorean geometry and the cosmos, the crazy magnet guy on YouTube breaking new ground about magnetism being energy acceleration.  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/kathodosdotcom">https://www.youtube.com/user/kathodosdotcom</a></p>

<p>Is the earth a magnet?  Are we held?  </p>

<p>You know?  Not knowing and being curious is such a fun story.</p>

<p>Somebody pure of outside toxins and influence could break new ground through meditation and manifestation. It would take knowledge of truth to not even have the wall of doubt built in the mind to overcome as most of us do.  In passing I&#39;ve seen claims that he&#39;s (the great genius) out there in protection learning.  Can&#39;t find where.  I read too much.  Probably not even true.  </p>

<p>None of us are that person though, so we can&#39;t say what magic could exist in this realm.  Maybe through belief and practice like exercising it would actually happen because we change our reality?  </p>

<p>I saw this study of people that imagined exercising intensely and got results.  <a href="http://archive.is/H2Ja7">http://archive.is/H2Ja7</a></p>

<p>Never seen footage of psychics that made me believe but I don&#39;t understand how it works.  </p>

<p>I do know that our minds are far more powerful than we know yet.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh yeah meditating is all about raising your core frequency and letting your mind take a break.  Just focus on breathing deeply and only think in and out. In and out.  As thoughts come to you go back to in and out.  Eventually your body vibrates and you can do whatever you want.  Get deeper and deeper if you want.  Use your imagination and ask questions and listen to silence in your mind and feel the answer.</p>

<p>Look up astral projection but also read into the dangers.</p>

<p>There&#39;s more out there. Researching curiosities you have will unveil many synchronicities. :)</p>

<p>Not sure I agree, but in that trench of thought, a future mars colony [when no actual mars colony exists] with random drawings/drafts for people to go there  (dissidents?) could be an easy way to get rid of people. Or maybe it&#39;s just the makings of a bad sci-fi movie.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The stars are not an illusion, they are points of light created by cymatic vibrations. Everything is created in a vortex fashion (golden ration) and everything revolves around the earth. The earth is unique in that it is the center or heart (earth anagram) separated from the &quot;outside&quot; by a solid structure or firmament which allows physical bodies to exist. The universe is enclosed and energy is recirculated in what we could call the cosmic egg or bubble. Quantum entanglement proves this closed system since they can&#39;t explain how changing one thing affects something instantaneously faster than light at the opposite end of the universe, but fractal holographic model shows this perfectly. The second law of thermodynamics also shows that energy is never &quot;lost&quot; but simply changed, this energy is recycled in a constant motion in and around and back through the singularity at the center. The flower of life holds the key to this and this knowledge has been suppressed and ignored for millennia. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>For me I learned this kind of knowledge in pieces or layers that have been building for about 2-3 years now. It is like an onion built layer by layer until a fuller picture is formed. I came at this originally from a spiritual angle while learning about ancient cosmologies and these geometric patterns that is found literally everywhere. I would say just start reading about sacred geometry and holofractal universe model. Nassim Haramein has a beautiful working model of the fractal universe but he still holds onto mainstream cosmology model and I subscribe to the ancient models . Look up stars and cymatics and magnetism and energy vibration/frequency. It was a long journey for me but there&#39;s so much information out now it shouldn&#39;t be too hard. I would say the greatest thing to come out of my research is that humans are extremely special and of divine origin and importance and all the current theories and science want people to think the exact opposite which should tell of the depth of this agenda  it is true spiritual mental warfare. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Wow I fucking love discussing/reading about these types of ideas.</p>

<p>That theory goes hand in hand with the work of Jacque Vallee. </p>

<p>He maintains that the UFO phenomenon is an elaborate cover up by TPTB in order to distract us from the understanding that our solar system is the only one. </p>

<p>Before reading your explanation I thought <em>that</em> was too out there. But after reading your perspective it makes more sense!</p>

<p>Where did you view this idea and where could I research it some more? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve never heard of him I&#39;ll check it out. There&#39;s definitely something fishy about UFO and government involvement and cover up. Either they have all this advanced technology and haven&#39;t unveiled it to the public or there are beings working with the governments teaching the tech or both. There&#39;s no question we are inundated with space and alien movies and shows all over the place to make us believe all these things so somehow all these things are connected and not by accident in my opinion. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah I personally haven&#39;t read his work yet but from what I&#39;ve heard that parallels a lot of what he says. </p>

<p>In essence, these beings all originated on earth at some point in the past (or future?). </p>

<p>I wonder then if people like Corey Goode, David Wolfpack and anybody else spreading the new age message is a part of this mission to lay the groundwork for future manipulation. </p>

<p>By conceding to a spiritual aspect of reality, while withholding the fact that our solar system, or earth, is unique, they stand to maintain control over the idea that the human race is just another evolving species in a vast ocean of life and rob us of the fact that we are unique. </p>

<p>Which makes me wonder, what makes us special? </p>

<p>I&#39;m trying to find out what you mean by asking you. I don&#39;t find anything useful when I google &quot;flower of life&quot;.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This knowledge was recorded before words like scientific came into existence and stand the test of time.</p>

<p>What knowledge? What are you trying to prove, and what is your evidence?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>What I am talking about is the notion that matter came into existence and is sustained through a dynamic energy field that we are all inside.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So basically, &quot;matter exists&quot;. So far I agree. In terms of &quot;dynamic energy field&quot;... I agree that the observable universe is a massive open dynamic system. But that&#39;s also universally supported by contemporary physics.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I am going against everything taught by modern science who won&#39;t acknowledge the existence of an aether or fluidity to all of this energy</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes, you are. Modern science carefully describes new concepts. You just throw &quot;Aether&quot; in the mix without saying what you mean, and how it relates to concepts that are empirically supported.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>but instead [modern science] form their physics models around dark matter and dark energy, terms meaning that they have no effing clue as to why particles are entangled (...)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Exactly. That&#39;s called a <em>hypothesis</em>. Scientists observe things, and they conceptualize a model that may explain it. Then, they try to falsify this model. If they manage to falsify it, then it isn&#39;t true. As long as they don&#39;t, it&#39;s viable. I don&#39;t know much about dark matter/energy, but IIRC it&#39;s a theory from the 1930s attempting to explain gravity. Gravity still isn&#39;t well understood. That doesn&#39;t mean your &#39;notion&#39; about &#39;Aether&#39; is has any grounding in reality.</p>

<p>The current theories in theoretical physics are irrelevant. We were discussing your ideas.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>(...) and why we have consciousness.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That&#39;s not what physics is trying to explain. That&#39;s philosophy of mind. I&#39;d be interested in your explanation of consciousness though.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I know why we have these things and the unified theory of everything is and has been here the whole time.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Then please, become a physicist. Physics isn&#39;t trying to push an agenda. Physics is trying to gain insight in the nature of the universe, and unexpected views are welcome as long as they&#39;re well argued.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So before I get into how paranormal experiences like the one you&#39;ve had can be related to holofractal, first I&#39;ll try and explain the theory.</p>

<p>This theory is a quantum gravity theory, that is it attempts to unify gravity with quantum physics.</p>

<p>There have been many people who have suggested that we perhaps live in a holographic universe - however we haven&#39;t had the physics or math to show how, until now.</p>

<p>This is not the holographic you may be used to, in this case the word means holos (whole) graphic (image) - the whole picture (or information) is available at every point.</p>

<p>This is not abstract - we are talking literally, in terms of quantum vacuum fluctuations.</p>

<p>The planck unit is a fundamental unit, the fundamental quanta of quantum mechanics, not defined by humans. It has a length, a mass, and a time - representing a wave fluctuation or oscillation</p>

<p>You can think of this as the absolute smallest electromagnetic fluctuation or universe does, the smallest oscillation of light. It is extremely tiny and extremely energetic.</p>

<p>The vacuum is supposed to be full of electromagnetism, i.e. the vacuum is expected to have a non-zero energy density - this is calculated by adding up all of the planck units that fit in a cubic centimeter of space.</p>

<p>This yields a number so extraordinarily high that physicists dismiss it out-hand, the number is 1093 grams / cm3 - the planck density.</p>

<p>Simply how many planck units tile in a cm3.</p>

<p>However, Nassim changes a few things. First, he sphericalizes the units instead of using cubic-packing, he uses closest-packed spheres.</p>

<p>He then tried to yield the proton&#39;s mass from these units, simply by treating the proton is an agglomeration of spherical planck units - they are both spheres so you can divide the proton volume by the planck sphere volume and multiply by the planck mass.</p>

<p>When you do this, you yield the mass of the observable Universe, at 1055 grams. There is simply the mass-energy of all protons inside of a proton if you calculate how many planck units fit inside, each with the planck mass.</p>

<p>He then used something called the holographic principle, which states the surface of a black hole can contain all of the information in the volume. Since the proton has this enormous amount of energy, he treated the proton as a micro-black hole, and divided the surface units by the volume units and multiplied by the planck mass.</p>

<p>When he did this, he got the mass of a single proton, at 10-24 grams.</p>

<p>This is telling us plainly that each protons mass-energy is represented holographically in every proton (i.e. all the information of 1080 protons is present in each individual proton), however only a tiny amount of the energy inside the volume is actually expressed locally.</p>

<p>The implications of this are astounding. These planck units can act as a bit of information, a 1 or -1 - meaning that each proton has a unique configuration of bits that make it up.</p>

<p>All protons are entangled, this is how the mass of all protons is present in every proton - an instantaneous holographic network.</p>

<p>This means that matter interacts with these holographic singularities, and time is the memory of these bit&#39;s previous states.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Tesla was light years ahead. I thought I&#39;d mention that for those interested, there exists a theoretical framework that could potentially explain all of tesla&#39;s work - the Reciprocal System theory. In this theory there are no particles, there is only motion - and that motion is that of space and time. Space is the reciprocal of time, and thus there exists 3 dimensions of time as well as 3 dimensions of space. </p>

<p>This theory has so far been used to correctly calculate from first principles (no &quot;physical constants&quot; used) the masses of all the fundamental particles, the masses of the elements, the interatomic distances of a variety of compounds, the critical temperatures of various substances, plancks constant, the gyromagnetic ratios of the leptons, and many other physical quantities. It reduces to the general relativistic equations of motion when describing planetary motions, and it calculates a similar deflection of light (but with an extra term not in the GR calculation, so this is something that would require an experiment to differentiate as current precision of measurements is not enough to differentiate the two theories). It also provides a conceptually appealing explanation for the wave - particle duality of light and small particles. </p>

<p>In this theory gravity and electromagnetism are two sides of the same coin, and has the potential to explain the &quot;antigravitic&quot; devices that tesla purportedly developed. It needs more theoretical development, though - when Dewey Larson the author of the theory tried to publish it in journals at the time (back in the 70s) they all rejected it - mostly because it was such a complete departure from the rutherford atom, rendering it incomprehensible to physicists trained with such preconceptions.

    <div class="md"><p>As long as you identify with a Physical Body and a Physical Dimension you have to address what you put into the Body/Avatar. Non Fluoride Water and a Vegetarian Diet cause significant increase in Vibratory Rate. Dense foods such as red meat are of a very low vibration and actually absorb the energy of &quot;fear&quot; from the slaughtered animal. I am not a doctor and not telling someone how to live but meats vibrate significantly lower and denser than spinach for example. Mediation and Relaxed Deep Thought are crucial. Visualize your expected coming events in the Minds Eye beforehand. The following takes enormous effort and I am not claiming I can do this on a regular basis. Doing any of this is exceptionately difficult: At a certain point you will want to start trying &quot;Project&quot; images in your Holographic Sphere (your perceived reality). Do you try to hit your hand with a hammer? Absolutely not. The rules of the Matrix still apply until you are in control, and in a way a &quot;Master&quot;. Start small; roll a tennis ball on the floor. See which direction you want it to actually roll. You &quot;see&quot; this in your head while at the same time looking at it. The version you &quot;see in your mind&quot; is another reality. The objective is to overlap the desired direction or reality with the one being projected by the matrix. This is a &quot;Dimensional Overlay&quot;. You are merging 2 realities together by thought until you are outpicturing the dominant projection. Wim Hof can jump in a lake of Polar Ice and be completely warm. He does this by controlling his entire body by thought. Yogi&#39;s and Tibetan Masters did the same. The only thing that actually exists is thought. Does that mean I can drop a chair on my foot? No. Of course not. As long as the matrix projects my reality the Laws of a Physics apply. Do some Yogis and Tibetan masters break the laws of physics from time to time. Yes</p>

Photons dont exist.
Electrons dont exist.
&quot;Space&quot; doesnt exist as a standalone constant, it is an effect.
Gravity isnt a standalone force.
Magnetism doesnt exist as a standalone force.
Aether DOES exist.
Aether is a medium in which electro-magnetism propates, same as air is a medium in which @sound&quot; propates.
Light, gravity, magnetism are effects of electromagnetic force being propated in different quallitative states trough aether (such as water/ice/gas).
Electric current is not a current of electrons trough a medium as &quot;carrier&quot; of the negative charge. Negative charge is an oxymoron, a logical fallacy. Negative &quot;charge&quot; is a DISCHARGE. It is a release of charge, it is an opposite of a particle.</p>

<p>In that regard, modern physics shot itself in the foot concluding that forces they were unable to find the causes for are standalone forces (magnetism, gravity). Tesla ridiculed Einsteins idea of particle physics, relativity, space-time grid and was a proponent of existence of aether.</p>

<p>What is different in a piece of rock that was made from normal to magnetic? Its physical attributes are exactly the same as before it was made magnetic. You changed its qualitative attributes, as in, its effect on aether.</p>

<p>Why is light on the edges of the edges of the spectre so strong it will kill you? What is different in its quallitative attributes from normal light?</p>
