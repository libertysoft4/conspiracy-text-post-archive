        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p><a href="http://archive.is/K6mx1">Article published 1/27 in Chicago Tribune</a></p>

<p>&quot;That&#39;s very frightening; it&#39;s difficult to imagine anyone less qualified to serve on a commission for vaccine science,&quot; said Peter Hotez, dean of the National School of Tropical Medicine at Baylor College of Medicine and president of the Sabin Vaccine Institute, a nonprofit that works to control, treat and eliminate vaccine-preventable and neglected tropical diseases.</p>

<p>&quot;The science is clear: Massive evidence showing no link between vaccines and autism, and as both a scientist who develops vaccines for poverty-related neglected diseases and the father of an adult daughter with autism, there&#39;s not even any plausibility for a link,&quot; Hotez continued. &quot;Autism is a genetic condition.&quot;</p>

<p><a href="http://archive.is/ZHCHJ">Article in 2014 about Baylor School of Medicine professionals accepting unethical sums of money from pharma companies</a></p>

<p>Dr. Christie Ballantyne, a Baylor College of Medicine cardiologist whose consulting got Grassley&#39;s attention 4 1/2 years ago, received the most drug company compensation among Houston physicians in 2012. In addition to funding they gave Baylor for his research, Pfizer and Merck paid him a total of $91,412, mostly for consulting.</p>

<p>Advancing patient care</p>

<p>In emails and interviews, Ballantyne defended the drug company relationships, which were approved by Baylor. He said he sees his relationships as important to advancing patient care.</p>

<p>&quot;I consult for companies because I have expertise that I hope may help in the search for new therapies,&quot; said Ballantyne. &quot;Research saves lives. I participated in a clinical trial when I was treated with lymphoma. If I had been diagnosed 50 years ago I would have lived less than 6 months.&quot;</p>

<p>But in 2009, Baylor&#39;s failure to disclose Ballantyne&#39;s consulting work for Merck at the same time he was also receiving federal research funding prompted Grassley to write the National Institutes of Health expressing &quot;serious concerns regarding Baylor&#39;s compliance&quot; with federal regulations. The NIH subsequently found Ballantyne hadn&#39;t done anything wrong - he reported the payment to the school - but faulted Baylor for failing to disclose the relationship, something it said was an oversight.</p>
