<p>Mobile phones use satellite back then as well, not just mobile towers. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>There were some satellite phones, yes, but they were expensive to own, expensive to use, had lousy coverage (worldwide, but not indoors, under ground, or, often, in areas with tall buildings), and the networks generally ran at very close to maximum load at all times.  When emergencies occur, such as 9/11 or Katrina, it&#39;s quite normal for the satellite networks to get overloaded very quickly.</p>

<p>Standard cellphones did not, and have never, used satellites directly.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Do you really think WTC was the only mobile tower as well in that area?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It wasn&#39;t, but that has little to do with why cellphones weren&#39;t working well on 9/11.  The main reason for that was that call volume swamped the available services as people tried to reach friends and family.  </p>

<p>Radios were unjammed, but if you&#39;ve ever tried to use a walkie-talkie in a large city, it&#39;s often quite difficult to reach someone if you don&#39;t have line-of-sight to them.  Again, tall buildings play hob with such things.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Maybe phones were down due to the unprecedented demand and usage going on, probably half of new York was calling 911 or family and loved ones. </p>

<p>Systems can only maintain so much workload, odds are they were working at capacity. </p>

<p>Also if any of landlines were tied in to the infrastructure located near the tower, the infrastructure was definitely damaged. Plus whatever cell phones used any hardware or technology that was on or in the towers, would of obviously failed to. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s a good question. Although I forget which one, but either short wave or long wave can be disrupted very easily. And that methods to disrupte or intercept the radio waves have been around since the 80s. I was a big issue with law enforcement awhile back. It was one of the reasons behind the big push for emergency services to have its own &#39;radio network&#39; and to make said network run off a digital system, not a analog one. </p>

<p>Radio waves aren&#39;t a topic I&#39;m particularly well versed in, but my understanding is radio waves are extremely easy to intercept and disable. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks. I&#39;m more curious about how radio could be disabled without someone purposefully doing it? The radios wouldn&#39;t go down due to infrastructure damage/too much radio traffic right? </p>

<p>I guess I just don&#39;t know how radios would be knocked out by anything in that situation short of purposeful, malicious human interference. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Your correct, radios wouldn&#39;t go down due to those reasons. </p>

<p>For radio waves to be intercepted or blocked/disabled, it would most likely have to be done with human intervention. Imo anyway. And I&#39;m talking radio waves. The new radio systems, which I&#39;m unsure if the 911 responders where using or not, would be alot easier to sabotage. Due to the fact everything would be tied in to the same system, which would ultimately have a source, and odds are the source would be easy to tamper with, example, shut the power off to the building that runs its server, or shut down the system it self. The new radio systems are run with computers, so shut those down and you shut down the radio system. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Honestly wouldn&#39;t surprise me. The amount of butt hurt people with their butt hurt feelings, running around on reddit is comical. Sad, but legit comical. </p>

<p>Its funny originally I was called a shill, one aspect of the definition is that basically people running around on reddit trying to sway the influence of certain post for political gain. Now I bet you, those same people that called me a shill and whatever else, are the actual ones going around changing votes and everything else because they are the ones butt hurt. 
I thought trump supporters which all tough and burley and they knew better so why were they gonna waste time trying to convince others. </p>

<p>Well, imo I honestly think all the reddit tampering or whatever you wanna call it comes from trump supports. The ones that claim aren&#39;t butt hurt, and claim they don&#39;t have time to convince others. Really the damage their own reputation and public standing. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>All I know is the overall content mix on this site is NOT organic. It&#39;s just another social engineering endeavor at this point. The false narratives that admins/mods try to push validate the beliefs of those users whose politics gain from it while the evidence of the fake narratives and the ensuing cover-ups and censorship further validate the beliefs of the other side of the spectrum by allowing them to fall back on the rigged system defense when they don&#39;t have a lot of support. </p>

<p>I think blaming it on Trump supporters is extremely silly when you look at the top subs like r/politics, r/worldnews, etc. They are so blatantly censored it takes a lot of mental gymnastics to conclude that Trump supporters are the ones doing the most damage. i blame the owners of the website for pushing their politics and being the opposite of transparent about it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Completely agree that the plotting doesn&#39;t originate in those subs. I think there is a strong presence of astroturfing groups on Reddit that work as partners or small groups with multiple accounts to plant and upvote stories artificially populated with comments that reinforce the narrative. They like to do things like give gold on low level comments and mass downvote and gaslight people who try to argue with them. The most memorable example recently was the BuzzFeed PissGate article that was posted in this sub. It was a coordinated effort to attack this sub, the users, and the mods and push a false narrative.</p>

<p>Are they though?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Because you don&#39;t have to dial a number each time you want to transmit, walkie-talkies are quick and easy to use. And best of all, they don&#39;t rely on finicky cell phone signals. The handsets transmit directly to each other, so they still work when cell networks fail during natural disasters or power outages. They&#39;re designed primarily for short-range communications, in which groups of people are within a few miles of each other.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I meant the whole system it self, not independent walkie talkies, but the the 911 call centres where the calls come in, to dispatch the police hear, databases, GPS, etc </p>

<p>This is hardly my forte, just going by memory. </p>

<p>Although I forget which one, but either short wave or long wave can be disrupted very easily. And that methods to disrupte or intercept the radio waves have been around for decades.</p>

<p>So how did Al Qaeda do it?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks I genuinely don&#39;t know much about the radio troubles of that day. To me it doesn&#39;t really matter because a missile hit the Pentagon. The rest of the details on that day like radios are  inconsequential. </p>

<p>I have studied 9/11 for a few years now and don&#39;t believe the radio problems were part of the plan. </p>

<p>Not to say its not possible, but I believe the radios were very problematic on their own.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Okay, so from how I remember it - There was mass panic. People calling loved ones and telling them what&#39;s going on, others of us with family in the places that were hit, well of course we&#39;re going to try and keep calling again and again.</p>

<p>The lines went down often and you couldn&#39;t get through to anyone - even states away. </p>

<p>That&#39;s my firsthand assessment of the phones being torn apart. We did the &quot;hug of death&quot; to the phones, much in the same way Reddit hug o&#39;death checking out sites can just obliterate their servers. </p>

<p>Now, with that said, I&#39;m just 1 person. There could have been EMF, there could have been interference and deliberate intention to disrupt.</p>
