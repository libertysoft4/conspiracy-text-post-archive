<p>The theory was that he was a plant not really for Clinton but for the Globalist elites, and that he existed to drive people to Clinton and make her policies look tame, when in reality her policies are more radical than Trump&#39;s.  </p>

<p>The theory was he&#39;d eventually say something so obscene and beyond the pail that he&#39;d be forced to drop out, like saying the N Word or something similar.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s all street theatre and nothing more, besides it doesn&#39;t even matter who is (s)elected president. They&#39;re just store mangers given a script by the central bankers, they have no voice in the matter, nor power unto themselves. Those who don&#39;t follow the script get fired like JFK. The truth is, is that voting provides people merely the illusion and pretence of participating in a democracy. </p>

<p>Does the store manager of WalMart set their own policies, directives and run his store as he sees fit? No, he or she gets their protocols and operational orders directly from top corporate. If you strip the veneer off of the presidency or any government leader in this manner you&#39;ll see it for what it is, nothing more than a con job. You&#39;re putting your allegiance in mortal men programmed to serve the central banking  powers and never you. Think you&#39;ll get a presidential saviour that will fix everything? Uhh, no. The fix is in and they&#39;re ONLY hiring crooks and psychopaths like themselves with AAA acting credentials.</p>

<p>You don&#39;t have to believe me at all, we&#39;ll all experience it in the next 4 years. Regardless of whom is imposed, the gains will be with the 1% and the losses perpetually siphoned off of the remaining 99%.</p>

<p>Then when you&#39;ve been abused to the point of madness, you&#39;ll be right back at the political casino pulling levers, for a new manager. Forever losing at trying to beat a corrupt casino using their house odds.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Idk i was kinda impressed with Trump in this first debate. He attacked Clinton, dnc leaks (about Russia being the one who did it), Isis, media. I&#39;m not sure what to think, but he definitely won that debate. I&#39;m surprisingly impressed by Trump tonight.</p>

<p>Edit: Also everyone here on conspiracy was screaming about &quot;Hillary won&#39;t make it to the debate, they won&#39;t ever allow this first debate to happen!!!&quot; Obviously they were very wrong, so don&#39;t take everything you read here as fact or consensus or anything like that.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>thats whats Im saying though.  The whole reason why he picked up steam in the first place, why Alex Jones listeners still support him, is that they believe Trump is speaking for the population that NEVER is given attention and is always forgotten.  And he continues to speak for them.  I believe he&#39;s a plant, but, its odd how he isn&#39;t throwing it in a more major way.  He&#39;s actively campaigning for votes.   He seems genuine about it.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>There are many more reasons for jobs leaving then &quot;high taxes&quot; and tariffs on imported goods. Such as average wages in Mexico being <a href="http://reuters.com/article/idUSKBN0ED20H20140602">around $5 a day</a> , and ecological laws being much more slack. </p>

<p>So just by cutting taxes nothing will change, except that the government will be out a load of tax money they rely on and will probably slap on top of your federal taxes.</p>

<p>So id you&#39;re willing to get paid $5 a day, live in a polluted slum, and pay more taxes because your employer isn&#39;t then we can have our jobs back.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t support either of them. But I do think he won tonight. And well he&#39;s right that she was wrong about alot of stuff, and I liked how he mostly stuck to attacking her political career instead of emails and her health or whatever and Hillary brought up a few times about his racist and sexist comments and things about his character all the while keeping her responses more general to questions such as &quot;I believe we need to rework the criminal justice system&quot; well cool anyone could&#39;ve said that Hillary. But I digress, i don&#39;t support either but Trump seemed like the more competently aggressive person tonight and i personally think he won this first debate.

<p>They are, but they are also bullet points that his demographic cares about, and that is why he mentions them.  If he was serious about doing something about the Federal Reserve, he wouldn&#39;t be where he is.  He only talks about what he thinks people want to hear.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t believe he is there to throw the election anymore.  After seeing his finalized policies and the people he has put on his staff or has said he will put on his staff, and reading between the lines of the ridiculous things he says, the only logical conclusion is that it does not matter who wins the election because both candidates are fully controlled.  They are both puppets of the ruling class.  Trump is fully owned and has agreed to all their terms.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t support either of them. But I do think he won tonight. And well he&#39;s right that she was wrong about alot of stuff, and I liked how he mostly stuck to attacking her political career instead of emails and her health or whatever and Hillary brought up a few times about his racist and sexist comments and things about his character all the while keeping her responses more general to questions such as &quot;I believe we need to rework the criminal justice system&quot; well cool anyone could&#39;ve said that Hillary. But I digress, i don&#39;t support either but Trump seemed like the more competently aggressive person tonight and i personally think he won this first debate. We will have to see what happens in the next few.</p>
