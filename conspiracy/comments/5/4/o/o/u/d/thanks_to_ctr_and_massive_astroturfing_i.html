<p>Yeah, because the political stances we have in high school should dictate what we&#39;re allowed to believe 50 years later.  Hillary campaigned for Goldwater in high school.  She&#39;s now 68 years old.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So many angry Trump supporters in conspiracy lately. They can&#39;t believe that their imbecile of a candidate propped up by 4chan trolls is going to get beat by a career politician with the support network of the establishment.</p>

<p>The pendulous nutsack of politics slapping them in the face has them completely blinded and thinking that by relativity Donald must be a good choice because Clinton is so awful. They&#39;re both subhuman filth but supporters can&#39;t maintain the cognitive dissonance it takes to recognize the farce and keep existing. Challenge their lack of substance and legitimate opinion and you get nothing but down votes and echos of,&quot;REEEE&quot; from across the internet. Because if you hate Donald you <em>must</em> be shilling for Hillary.</p>

<p>This election is a great display of how fucked we are and it has almost nothing to do with the candidates.and everything to do with the dipshits that refuse to recognize the game and how they&#39;re being played.</p>

<p>God forbid you try to make it a discussion because the best you&#39;ll get is a bunch of clucking and,&quot;lulz idc it&#39;s all bullshit.&quot;  As though their opinion of no opinion somehow justifies a blind support of whichever fuck head or makes them different from the other side.</p>

<p>It was only a matter of time before the people annoyed by that trash started fighting back. I browsed reddit with no account using <a href="/r/all">/r/all</a> for over 4 years and signed up so I didn&#39;t have to read that bullshit anymore. At this point the only thing <a href="/r/all">/r/all</a> is missing vs 4chan is a bunch of cp. Fucking disgusting all around.</p>

<p>I dont have any love for either candidate, this entire election has been a farce of unheard proportions, but blame rests on both sides and I hope that we can see that from the sidelines of our conspiracy corner.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Where did I say that?</p>

<p>I made an account so I could curate my own front page in effort to cut off all the nonsense. I have no idea what all looks like at the moment. What I do know is 3 or 4 months ago a quarter of the front page of all was cuck cuck cuck nonsense troll posts.</p>

<p>Both candidates are complete trash with identical followings.</p>

<p>Now you&#39;re pissy that it&#39;s Hilary and not Donald all over the front page? I can tell by all the down votes that noone is interested in any kind of discussion or actually touching on the problems of the ilk masquerading as leaders. You just can&#39;t stand the droning sound of your fuckwit peers clucking being drowned out by a real political machine.</p>

<p>It was my mistake for assuming that the people in <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> thought it was all equally ridiculous and a poor assumption on my part that we weren&#39;t having a pro-donald discussion.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It was underwhelming, if it makes you feel better. Read my synopsis with the understanding that I loathe Clinton as a candidate, and mildly dislike Trump. </p>

<p>Trump was on the defensive for most of the debate, which surprised me. He spent a lot of time defending his business practices and tax returns. He was pretty short of ideas and actual substance. He didn&#39;t call Clinton on a lot of the shit that he could&#39;ve, and should have.</p>

<p>Clinton managed to stand for 90 minutes and not look like a person suspected of Parkinson&#39;s. It&#39;s sad that&#39;s a highlight, but there we go. She side-stepped Trump&#39;s quips as if they didn&#39;t happen. She also made Trump look uninformed (like when he brought up stop and frisk as a legit policy option).</p>

<p>I watched the debate hoping for much more drama, but it didn&#39;t happen. I think we&#39;ve been spoiled by an election full of incredible twists and turns, but this debate wasn&#39;t one of them. It was rather boring. Neither candidate made me want to run out and campaign for them, or convince people I know to vote for either one. In terms of excitement and general bombastic rhetoric, this is on par with any election year&#39;s debate.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>To be totally honest, I am biased for Trump, but I feel like I watched a different debate than everyone else. He was active and going hard the whole time which meant he may have misstepped once or twice, but she had nothing, no game whatsoever. He was nailing her to the cross left and right: where&#39;s your thousands of emails? You staff was taking the fifth amendment, the guy who set up your private server took the fifth amendment. He even asked her if she&#39;s been working in government her whole life, why is she just having all these ideas now? He even said, you&#39;ve been fighting ISIS your whole adult life, now they&#39;re in thirty countries.</p>

<p>I think people are just responding to the fact that he came off like kind of a dick, which I&#39;m not saying isn&#39;t legitimate. Like I said I admit I&#39;m biased towards him. But if you were to just read a transcript of the debates, he had several complete and total killshots, she did not. Everything they tried to nail him with (taxes, businesses, racism) he had a solid answer to. He dodged the woman issue by talking about Hillary Clinton&#39;s stamina, they set themselves up poorly there.</p>

<p>My prediction: the moderator is obviously on Clinton&#39;s side, and she already has no game. This was the first debate. In the next two we&#39;ll see him go in hard and try and end her. This is it, this is the final battle, from the first ten minutes of this debate it was obvious he&#39;s putting it all on the line, there&#39;s nothing left after this.</p>

<p>Trump was right about stop and frisk, a judge ruled it unconstitutional and it was appealed, and just like he said, the process is still ongoing. Why is DeBlasio talking about stop and frisk if it was ruled unconstitutional years ago? Because it&#39;s still being appealed, just like he said. The rate of homicides has also increased in NYC along with other serious crimes, only petty crimes are down. Is there something else he was factually wrong about?</p>

<p>There are a thousand metrics by which to measure crime, if someone says crime is up do they mean compared to this time last year or compared to 1970? I think you can agree that it&#39;s kind of weak one, it&#39;s far from the flat out pants on fire lie that the Clinton camp is portraying it as. You know, a pants on fire lie like when Hillary said she never dealt with any classified info, or that she didn&#39;t have a private server, or that she didn&#39;t delete the emails, or like when she lied about her support of the TPP, or like when she lied about collapsing because she was overheated, and then it was because she was dehydrated, you know, like a flat out objective lie. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Should I be &quot;triggered&quot; that you called it a &quot;conspiracy theory&quot; like many others of this sub?</p>

<p>No tough on crime policies don&#39;t work, community policing does, tough on crime is all about locking people away, making money off of them if they can, and alienating the lower income areas to continue making a profit and to suppress these areas. You sound like one of these guys who still thinks marijuana is a gateway drug and should be scheduled the same as heroin.</p>

<p>I&#39;m from the inner city, you know what works? When the cops of the beat you live on know who most everyone is, know who the troublemakers are, and know how to find them. Also working with the community and hosting events does wonders to bring people together. Are there going to still be holdouts like the gangs and the drug suppliers/distros? Of course there will be but the community will be more apt to say fuck the &quot;stop snitching&quot; and actually give a crap about their community and get these pieces of shit behind bars. Also eliminating corrupt cops from being cops is a huge part of this as well, when corruption sets in these POS will work with the POS&#39;s in the community.</p>

<p>I&#39;m all about over-policing too, saturate these areas with a police presence that works with the community and you will stop having problems with the community, but show them respect, treat them like people and citizens not like possible criminals, what&#39;s the saying oh yeah &quot;innocent until proven guilty&quot; duh. Stop and frisk is unconstitutional, at least until some appeal over turns it (they won&#39;t, it&#39;s a really shitty policy), and it&#39;s disrespectful to those that are law abiding citizens, and it singles out one type of person. I&#39;m white as fuck, I can lawfully carry my pistol with me anywhere I want to go without fear of being harassed by the police, can a black man doing similar do the same under stop and frisk, no of course not. </p>

<p>And really honestly I&#39;ve had this debate so many fucking times I could care less if you agree, my dad is a cop he agrees, my cousin, cop, agrees, half my family are cops or DOC, they all agree on this one, it makes sense. </p>

<p>Don&#39;t get me wrong I realize the lower income communities have to meet the police halfway but the halfway starts when cops stop shooting people, covering it up, and getting away with it, these people are supposed to be trained professionals and most departments these days barely require a high school diploma, the standards have dropped and you can tell that clearly cops are shooting when they don&#39;t have to, they&#39;re blaming everyone but themselves and most of them aren&#39;t held accountable at all. </p>

<p>After that then we can point out to them where they were wrong about someone like Mike Brown and Ferguson.</p>

<p>And it&#39;s called paraphrasing, obviously he didn&#39;t say exactly that, but Trump did say he was wrong every time he was corrected, if a moderator in a debate corrects you then you are wrong, not the other way around, that&#39;s how debate moderation works, and they wouldn&#39;t be trotting out bullshit because of all of the viewers and possible speculation, anyone who would disagree with the corrections just aren&#39;t grounded in reality anymore. </p>

<p>Edit 2: Oh, I see. So they can ridicule Trump. FYI they&#39;re supposed to be non-partisan.</p>

<p>Edit 3: Clinton answered question 1 like a poorly read script, so far I&#39;m laughing. I&#39;m actually surprised she remembered all that, despite being off-topic as shit.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t think Trump lost any voters, Hillary probably didn&#39;t gain any. 
She brought up his (six, four) bankruptcies, he replied he used the current laws. </p>

<p>She said Russia hacked the DNC, he countered with &quot;You don&#39;t know that&quot;</p>

<p>She asked about his tax returns, he agreed to release them after she released the 30,000_ emails she deleted. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t completely support trump but I refuse to support a candidate who&#39;s attack dogs that&#39;s known as the MSM  is attacking a Candidate for having a friendly relations with a leader of a super power.</p>

<p>The same MSM that won&#39;t cover a shooting at a party in the inner city that has 5 dead bodies would use a school schooling to disarm Americans.</p>

<p>The same MSM that used the Daughter of an ambassador to plunge the US into a war in the past, is now attacking a candidate for being friendly to Putin as the MSM has been beating the war drums for Syria.</p>

<p>The same war that MSM that attacked bush for getting the US into a war, is the same war that MSM used a Little girl  to lie to get the USA involved with.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t completely support Trump, In fact I wish Pat Buchanan was the Republican candidate instead of Trump.</p>

<p>I&#39;m just glad that if Clinton does not win the WH it&#39;s retirement for her. I&#39;m skeptical of trump like everyone else, but it&#39;s obvious  to everyone that Clinton is a monster. The Polls are fraudulent,and nobody shows up her rallies where trump packs stadiums.</p>

<p>Yet please don&#39;t say that the system is rigged because your candidate didn&#39;t win . He didn&#39;t really confront the corruption whenever she stole has victories from him. Sanders should have been making noise and threatening to shove his fist into her ass when the news came out that Clinton rigged the voting machines. He had the support to make her corruption into a crusade.</p>

<p>Even Jill put up a bigger fight at the end of the day. Trump should had invited Jill to the Debates when she tried to join it. 
It would had certainly boosted his numbers by being nice like that.</p>

<p>At the debate Trump should had  offered to Pardon Snowden &amp; Assange in exchange for community service such as Auditing the entire government with the help of  Rand &amp; Ron Paul. Trump should had stated that he has suspicions of the Obama Admin torturing Bradly manning into becoming a transvestite,and if manning were to be Pardoned he would need to be sent to proper facilities to help him.</p>

<p>Everyone is begging for Pardons for Snowden &amp; Assange, so let an republican  like Trump who claims to be an outsider offer to give the pardons.
Then Clinton would look bad to the Liberal voters,and then the MSM would be forced to tell to the Liberal voters who want the Pardons to happen why Trump is crazy for offering to give Pardons to the two/three. The Conservatives would raise flags over how a normal guy like Manning wanted to become a transvestite after being held in government facilities.</p>

<p>I also wish that Trump brought up the fact that there were several hundred missiles in the Benghazi embassy.
Like really. What the fuck? Why were there missiles in a embassy? i wanted Trump to bring up those missiles and how Clinton refused to allow more guards to be stationed to guard the missiles . I wanted trump to bring up how Obama&#39;s Admin knew about the Missiles,but stopped an Admiral from sending in help.</p>

<p>I wanted Trump to say the following.</p>

<p>&quot;I&#39;ll persecute the Obama Admin,Republicans,and Dem if there&#39;s evidence that they&#39;ve been supporting ISIS in one form or another as I&#39;m not going to play the political games where I&#39;m biased toward any political party.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I&#39;ll persecute Clinton through the court system.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I&#39;ll persecute Clinton&#39;s daughter for having access to the server that had classified info on it.&quot;</p>

<p>I&#39;ll persecute the Obama admin for knowing about  the Email server but he didn&#39;t shut it down.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;My Admin will persecute the FBI for corruption.&quot;</p>

<p>This is why I see the people who still openly support Trump as either completely ignorant or they&#39;re concern trolls &quot;oh Hillary is going to do this or that&quot; when they don&#39;t really care either way they just want to make America whatever their vision of America is and it parallels things Trump has said, completely has nothing to do with Hillary.</p>

<p>And seriously after all of the bitching about astroturfing and propaganda the collective of r/The_Donald and the 4chinners that have drifted here sure as hell do a ton of it, brigading as well, it&#39;s hypocrisy same with their sub being a &quot;beacon of free speech&quot; or whatever yet it&#39;s a complete safe space that bans any dissenting thought, but sure let&#39;s bitch about the Reddit hivemind.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think Hillary probably won the debate. I guess it really comes down to how the undecideds feel. But here is my conspiracy theory for the debate.</p>

<p>Looking at the video of the debate at the 1:02:00 mark, it appears that she is speaking from a manuscript.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryp51N21vOU&amp;amp;feature=youtu.be">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryp51N21vOU&amp;amp;feature=youtu.be</a></p>

<p>This was a new question on a new subject, so there shouldn&#39;t have been notes already written. And she looked down like I do when speaking from a manuscript. At the end of nearly every sentence and when she kind of loses her thought, she looks down at the bottom right of her podium. </p>
