    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m praying but imho he could have buried her in the first one and there would be now way for her to dig out. He hit on some points but nothing that wasn&#39;t very damaging. One topic was matters of Internet security/hackers. That alone could have be a kill shot. Hillary again throwing blame at Russia for the DNC hacks ect ect. We all know her win was rigged and Trump should have said something along the lines of &quot;this debate should really be between me and Sanders&quot;. He hit DWS on something but it was just looked over. Also did anyone else hear the comment from Hillary about fact checking? Can&#39;t remember what they were discussing but it seemed odd for her to call that out.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You know I&#39;ve come to a conclusion with Hillary Clinton and her scandals. The fact that we can come together and figure out what laws were broken but the people who really have the power to do something about it failed to get her prison says alot.

If these people are too incompetent to create a scenario that would guarantee indictment then they don&#39;t need to be managing shit else.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is why third parties would be so awesome in a debate (that wasn&#39;t rigged, that is). Trump is not and will never be the type of guy to list off very specific facts and figures... Whether he&#39;s being paid to do so or it&#39;s just his personality. </p>

<p>Stein is brutal in this regard and I think Johnson would do well too, hopefully in a fantasy world if they all debated Johnson and Stein wouldn&#39;t focus on the bait (Trump) and will just tear into Hillary like she deserves. Her horrible, terrible blatant corrupt ways should be in national spotlight and more than anything I want to see this. Even better would be after Assange releases those emails he claims he has.</p>
