<p>Hi S, </p>

<p>When you get in Monday, can you please give me an update?  Because by Tuesday your department will have elapsed since the last update I received from you, which was that you informed me that you had forwarded this request to the Drugs center. So if I don&#39;t hear from you by Monday or Tuesday morning at the latest, I would be holding the FDA in breach of the 20 day legal requirement to fulfill my FOIA request.  </p>

<p>If you look at when I initiated the FOIA, it&#39;s well longer than that, so I&#39;ve proven I&#39;ve given The FDA ample time to at least give me a reasonable estimate of how long it will take to fulfill the request, which you have not done.  Effectively, I&#39;ve received no information beyond the acknowledgement of receipt of my request and that you&#39;ve forwarded this request to the &quot;Center for Drugs&quot; department.</p>

<p>Please let me know right away what the status of this request is.   Thank you.</p>
</blockquote>

<hr/>

<p>THIS POST&#39;S ORIGINAL TEXT BELOW</p>

<p>I&#39;m holding them in breach of their 20 day deadline, after this I&#39;m hiring foiaadvocates.com to go and fuck them a new asshole to rip those docs from their bureacratic reptile stonewalling fingers.  I want to pull a chaffetz and be like, ok so it&#39;s tuesday...</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;What are you doing if you&#39;re not fulfilling my FOIA request?  That&#39;s your JOB...I&#39;m going to issue a subpoena <em>and i&#39;m going to do it righnow</em>.  Can you accept service on behalf of the US Government?  Ok well you are hereby served&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I already have the forms filled out for ombudsman and some foia oversight committe and I&#39;m talking to foiaadvocates.  I&#39;m ready to storm the castle and take a wild wings postgame spinning hot shit in the air.  I&#39;m talking full satellite shartcast</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Been asking myself the same question for years, but never thought of FOIA. I feel like an idiot.</p>

<p>How can a substance be considered to have no medical value when the United States government itself is owner of the patent on its use medically, and 25 states plus the District of Columbia have changed their laws to allow use of that substance because of its medical efficacy? </p>

<p>Seriously, it defies all available logic, and apparently it is extremely difficult for anyone at the FDA to provide documentation or evidence of any sort that &#39;no medicinal value&#39; is a valid statement. I look forward to Tuesday, and what happens next if the FDA fails to comply.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Based only on the wording of the title, it&#39;s entirely possible your FOIA request would be denied for being too broad in nature.  When filing a FOIA request, you have to be specific, in that you are requesting specific documents.  For example Document XYZ in regards to ABC incident.  In your case, this might be &quot;Document 2145, in regards to the study performed about the possible medicinal benefits of Cannabis..&quot; should such a specific document exist.</p>

<p>A full detailed list and sample letter can be found at:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.arts.gov/freedom-information-act-guide">https://www.arts.gov/freedom-information-act-guide</a></p>

<p>With the letter being: </p>

<p><a href="https://www.arts.gov/foia/sample-foia-request">https://www.arts.gov/foia/sample-foia-request</a></p>

<p>Of particular note in the possible denial causes, quote &quot;The request is especially voluminous or complex.&quot;  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve considered that, but there is no indication that is the case from my conversations with them.  </p>

<p>I would be GLAD to ask for specific documents if I knew what those documents were.  However, they will not tell me what those documents are, so I cannot request what I don&#39;t know.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve raised this issue to them, and therefore I&#39;ve come to the conclusion that if they don&#39;t serve my FOIA on the basis of &quot;all documents responsive to____&quot; then they will have failed their own guidelines and I will be able to prove it.</p>

<p>You see, this is not, nor has it ever been about getting them to give me a FOIA request.  This has been both an exercise in exposing the stonewalling and foot dragging and petulant obstructionism of the US government to people here on REDDIT as much as it has been a means to throw them under the bus in terms of fulfilling the request, so that I could then take them to court and/or subpoena and/or hold them in contempt to a larger group of ombudsman and &#39;make this issue far more prominent&#39; in the news.</p>

<p>Once I get this to the ombudsman and point out THEIR stonewalling, I&#39;ll contact the Guardian and Intercept and I will give them everything, if they aren&#39;t already watching this issue now.  I&#39;ll forward all my email correspondence to them and tell them what I&#39;m doing.</p>

<p>I mean it would be NICE if they just fulfilled my FOIA like regular human beings, or like the honest, transparent bureaucracy we imagine them to be (but aren&#39;t).  But I never EVER expected that of them</p>

<p>Because you know and I know, and everyone knows, the FDA is corrupt.  We&#39;ve had at least 20 points of data to know this.  So you can&#39;t expect a group that&#39;s so obviously lying about this issue to come clean.  </p>

<p>You want to compel them to give up info, and when they can&#39;t because they say, &#39;oops cannot find records&#39; becuase they are hiding who is responsible....</p>

<p>....Then you double down and say .....</p>

<p>FUCKIN NAILED YOU BITCH HOLES, you have no evidence and therefore you are invalid and this decision is invalid and therefore the dea classification based on this is invalid and therefore the 1971 convention on psychotropic substances upon which the classification are based is INVALID..</p>

<p>and therefore it is allowed and you have to retroactively invalidate all pot arrests and pay out 1M to each person incarcerated or we&#39;ll start suing them...because they are PRIVATE PRISONS and are holding these people illegally</p>

<p>(you can&#39;t sue the government, but you can sue their contractors)</p>

<p>we start a class action lawsuit and get &#39;successful colorado marijuana investors&#39; to kickstart it and promise them a 50% return on winnings and tell them to hire erin brockovitch and daniel sheehan</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Glad to.  The FDA has--at several times apparently--declared that cannabis has no medical value, despit the US Government having a prior patent on cannabis as medicine and despite over 100 articles published on NIH clearly demonstrating cannabis&#39; medical utility (national institutes of health, a .gov site; a government institution and the highmost medical research authority in the world, or at least one of the highest).  This is then, a huge controversy, because it demonstrates that the FDA was guided by outside interests to lie to the public, and we are going to find out who did it and we&#39;re going to fuck them a new asshole by publishing their names online.  They have sovereign immunity and can&#39;t be sued; apparently the people working can&#39;t be sued either for the same immunity.  But that won&#39;t stop them from getting their asses kicked by mafias who have lost trillions for decades because of these people, or hippies whose lives were interrupted by their lies.  Or also we could take them in per RICO (racketeering).</p>

<p>Of course, I am not going to harm any of these people (well I might be able to help rico them), but we will get those names and even if I&#39;m not the person who publishes them, they will be known eventually and they will be published.  In other words, we&#39;re coming for them and it&#39;s just a matter of time. They should make plans to leave the country and change their identities.  It will be much harder for INTERPOL to RICO them</p>

<p>I&#39;m all for it, but with how passive Americans have become, especially with the whole scandal happening in the presidential race, I serious doubt people will care.  I care.  But people will upvote this on reddit and then forget about it when they see the next dancing bear gif posted...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is actually more important of an issue to most americans than a reptile versus banshee being put in office, especially since their reptile-bansheehood and this whole race has retroactively validated the fact that they&#39;ve all been reptiles and banshees back to maybe even the founding fathers.</p>

<p>regex replace freemasons with reptils and banshees with jesuits/knigts of malta</p>

<p>their chicanery is increasingly irrelevant.  They may get into their escape pods before we catch them all, but in the meantime, we&#39;re focused on making them more irrlevant by creating tools that only we can use.  We&#39;re going to be a secret society that includes the global everycitizen civilian by default, precludes all military and commercial interest by design, and uses true democracy principles and true transparnency in the open source open / everything diyethic movement.  at one point they will blink and realize they are marooned into their own insular economy and we&#39;ll be producing our own video content on our own youtube using our own monetized schemas that go to our own open source banks which are digital wallets backed up on paper using ciphers that we publish, growing our own food in our food in our own community gardens, in our own villages, etc. they will just have to kill us palestine style at that point.  But they should be careful we&#39;ll have our own robots and 3d printed bullets</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s ok don&#39;t worry.  I have a grand budgetted for this, but instead of paying for the paper at the FDA, instead it&#39;s going to lawyers as of tuesday.  They busted their deadline which means the FDA will have to pay the cost to print the paper, which means it&#39;s implicitely crowdfunded now by 100% of america :) in that taxpayers pay for fda.  So think of all those assholes who say, &#39;that damn mari-huanar makes people lazy and stupid&quot;.  Them.  They will be paying xerox fees.  In some small way, that should give you a pot boner</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thank you. It&#39;s actually getting really annoying. I called the CDER FOIA office today and it rang 5 times and then dropped me to a fast busy signal.  I couldn&#39;t reach anyone.  </p>

<p>I also want to appeal to the director of FDA but when you click email him, it pops up an browser email window (ie: he used &#39;mailto:&#39; ) but the mailto data is NOT an email address but a malformed hyperlink.</p>

<p>When I said that government employees are the most lowest form of incompetent useless person there is, I was not at all joking.  It&#39;s pretty mean to say someone is useless, but in this case I mean it 100% </p>

<p>Theyve been stonewalling me.  They are not patriots. They don&#39;t carea bout justice or truth</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I couldn&#39;t agree with you more. Everything is about money to them. If it gets out that cannabis actually wasn&#39;t found to be deserving of a schedule one label, they&#39;d lose an entire business. Which is just silly because they could start an even bigger one by legalizing and taxing it! Please post and let us redditors know if there&#39;s any way we can help you move this forward.</p>
