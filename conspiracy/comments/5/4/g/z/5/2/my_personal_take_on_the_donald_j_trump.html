        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Netizens of conspiracy, </p>

<p>There is a lot of debate within <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> about the legitimacy of Trump&#39;s candidacy.  I understand people&#39;s suspicions on Trump.  In the wake of #occupywallstreet and other similar popular movements, it isn&#39;t hard to find the neon pink elephant in the room that Trump is a billionaire, Trump is the 1%, Trump is therefore bad.</p>

<p>Unfortunately for civilization, for you, for me and for everyone that we have never even considered.  Perfect utopian equality, perfect utopian socialism, perfect utopian communism and/or perfect utopian capitalism will NEVER exist.  You can take any system and no matter how perfectly conceived it is, the common denominator of ruin is the individual.  It&#39;s YOU, it&#39;s ME! It&#39;s some fucker we have never even considered!</p>

<p>So forgive my bluntness but Bernie&#39;s social paradise will have just as many shortcomings as the American dream has.  </p>

<p>Now back to Trump, the RNC never considered that Trump would best their highly groomed (all dues paid) candidates.  They were able to ignore Ron Paul (PBUH) because Ron Paul, as genius as the man is and as much as I wish he had been our president for these last several years, Ron Paul was NOT willing to say ridiculous shit to keep tricking all the MSM cameras to point in his direction.</p>

<p>I keep hearing people say &quot;If Trump wasn&#39;t a part of the establishment, they would just ignore him like Ron Paul&quot;.</p>

<p>Wrong, the RNC ignored him just fine, they talked about how unelectable Trump is, they prophesied that this week was his last every single week for the duration of the Republican primaries.  They did everything to Trump that they did to Ron Paul, and more, and they still couldn&#39;t kill his campaign for one reason.</p>

<p>Trump is an attention whore, and if the right wing media wouldn&#39;t cover him... The left wing media would.  For all the wrong reasons but like an attention hungry child... Bad attention is just as satisfying as good attention.  Ron Paul would have never done that.  Ron Paul was village wise man, cooly composed and confident in his infinite wisdom.  Trump is the ambitious outsider who has never been in line for these coveted positions of rank in our society, he has never paid his dues. For the GOP Trump is that guy they never even considered. They didn&#39;t plan for him because they couldn&#39;t have, he was never considered.  He blind sided them.</p>

<p>Unfortunately for our society, we need an asshole to tear back the curtains and shock everyone.  The dishonest media, lying Ted, crooked Hillary.</p>

<p>For good or for bad the USA will never be the same.  Honestly even if Trump loses he has already awakened a huge segment of the population who 8 months ago would have NEVER EVEN CONSIDERED some of the conspiracy centric ideas that this community has discussed for years before anyone thought of Trump being the president.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t think Trump will be the best president that we&#39;ve ever had, but I do think that IF TRUMP WINS, he will clear a path for some fucker we have never even considered, who will be the best president we will ever have. It&#39;s always the fuckers that nobody ever considered that make history great.  They can&#39;t be planned for, they can&#39;t be controlled by ritual or right.  </p>

<p>These nobody&#39;s that we fail to consider disrupt the staleness of established orders, they move us back in favor of the individual because all the rules suddenly change.  And slowly new rules get established and refined and then corrupted again until some fucker we never considered appears and for good or ill, changes all the rules again.</p>

<p>Good luck out there fuckers. Consider this.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>40% tax cuts on the 1% would devestate this country.  That policy alone is reason enough for me to never support him.  The Bush tax cuts fucked the country for years and we&#39;re still trying to dig out of it.  He will have to slash social programs across the board, including education.  Trickle down economics is a fucking farce that has been disproven time after time.  The wealthy do not deserve another tax cut just so they can hoard more wealth while the rest of us pick up the slack for their lazy, selfish, greedy fucking asses!</p>

<p>I don&#39;t understand how you could possibly support a candidate who not only supports the patriot act but thinks it isn&#39;t good enough.  He thinks NSA isn&#39;t good enough.  Wants to give even more money to Israel!!  For fucks sake!  I want to know why you actually support any candidate who supports those policies!!  For YEARS we have all agreed that those were deal breakers, so what is so god damn amazing about Trump in your eyes???  What, that he&#39;s a slick talker?  You think the country is going to be saved by someone just because he is impolite?  Get fucking real!</p>

<p>Trump is establishment 100%.  He supports classic neocon policies straight down the board!  He is george W in different clothes.  I don&#39;t understand how anyone could not see that.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Great post. Fuck Trump. His whole campaign is part of a massive psyop in which every alternative news and &quot;conspiracy&quot; message board has been hijacked and subverted, completely overrun by pro-Trump shills. 
The Trump agenda has served many purposes. It has destroyed what was left of the Truth movement, destroyed all credibility of the Alternative news scene, polarized this scene and the country at large even further than previous his presidential bid....Trump is nothing more than a release valve for White Working Class angst, just as the equally contrived Tea Party movement was before, and the BOGUS Ron Paul &quot;revolution&quot; before it (yes, Ron Paul is nothing more than controlled opposition- just look at his son).
Trump is playing the part given him. He was never meant to win, just to corrall as many of you as possible into his bullshit cult of personality, then leave you feeling totally disillusioned and spiritually exhausted when he loses. Now, with the development of Hillary&#39;s health issues, I do feel the plan has changed and there is a possibility he may actually win, although VERY slim (i.e. Hillary drops dead or has a stroke between now and November). As much as I DREAD the prospect of Hillary as president, I dread a Trump presidency even more. He will turn out to be the most authoritarian, boot-licking, Constitution-destroying president imaginable. I think he will be worse than Bush TBH. Say goodbye to the internet and free speech. The poor will get fucked so hard under Trump that it honestly gives me nightmares. </p>

<p>All you Trump-bots...I hope you are rich, or at least upper middle class. If you are working class he is your worst enemy. Go back and watch a few episodes of The Apprentice and tell me trump is a good guy.</p>

<p>This tired old Hillary campaign rhetoric again? Trump clearly states that the top tax bracket will be 33%.  So are you saying the top tax bracket is currently 73%? <a href="https://www.donaldjtrump.com/positions/tax-reform">https://www.donaldjtrump.com/positions/tax-reform</a></p>

<p>I could make the exact same claims against you with zero facts and it would mean the exact same thing, nothing at all.</p>

<p>We&#39;ve all heard the MSMs condemnation of the alt-right, yes yes we know that Pepe is an alt-right attempt to popularize white supremacy we&#39;ve seen it on Clinton&#39;s campaign website.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.hillaryclinton.com/feed/donald-trump-pepe-the-frog-and-white-supremacists-an-explainer/">https://www.hillaryclinton.com/feed/donald-trump-pepe-the-frog-and-white-supremacists-an-explainer/</a></p>

<p>See! You&#39;re spouting propaganda while accusing me of being a propagandist!</p>

<p>The dreaded alt-right, aka people who don&#39;t support the Bushes, the Clintons or Bernie Sanders.. what will we ever do with these deplorables who have these opinions?</p>

<p>Look at you, I&#39;m sure you fancy yourself as heroic with your powerful condemnation of me and my opinions.  What you fail to see is that you immediately abandoned civil debate/discussion and immediately resorted to personal attacks and shill accusations (both distinctly against our rules, which I&#39;m ignoring because it wouldn&#39;t be fair of me to moderate my own Post&#39;s &quot;criticisms&quot;) </p>

<p>I&#39;m 100% certain that EVERYONE, without exception, has their own opinion of this year&#39;s presidential election.  Opinions ranging from Bernie Sanders to &quot;voting itself only perpetuates the system&quot; and everything in-between from Clinton to Trump and even yes... Even Cruz.</p>

<p>Are they also NWO2.0 propagandists?  Or is that designation reserved for me?</p>

<p>And if we are talking about NWO 2.0, doesn&#39;t that imply that NWO 1.0 was defeated or accomplished? News to me!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not making my white supremacist claims from this post but rather you racist soap boxing in your &quot;community outreach&quot; sub. </p>

<p>The alt-right and alt-left are just as lost as one another. Noam Chomsky v Alex Jones. They&#39;re both hacks. </p>

<p>Look at you, twisting words back on to me, trying to presume I feel heroic. I didn&#39;t abandon civil debate, I gave you two claims that he&#39;s the establishment man, him fitting out a crew of vatican men, and his sisters monetary affiliations with the Jesuits. He&#39;s history is shady as fuck, and it&#39;s obvious with only a cursory analysis that he&#39;s not an anti-establishment candidate.</p>

<p>You dodged this, and attempted to cleverly turn this back to me stifling your speech, which is the reason why I don&#39;t think you&#39;re a useful idiot but rather a paid propagandist. I don&#39;t expect you to censor my personal attacks and shill allegations because you&#39;ll probably just use a sock or some hall monitor like SM or dusty will come in here and do it for you so you keep your free speech cred. </p>

<p>The 1.0 is &quot;defeated&quot;. Check out Clinton. She&#39;s out from this week. You really think Trump is your &quot;We did it, reddit!&quot; moment? Give me a break. He&#39;s been propped us as the bonafide anti-establishment candidate from the beginning. Alex Jones endorses him ffs. </p>

<p>Bernie is. I told you that ages ago. Watch what happens when Clinton drops out as I&#39;ve said she was going to do all along. They&#39;ve got all their benchwarmers on standby. Bernie and Michelle Obama or Kaine probably. I think they&#39;ll do Michelle just for the lols when they can out her as a transgender. Probably what all the trans fuss is preparing for. </p>

<p>This one way shit, where everyone is supposed to listen to what you have to say while nobody else has an opinion that is &quot;worthwhile&quot; is cowardly, pussy bullshit.

<p>You&#39;re so focused on your little nationalistic bubble saying how &quot;Trump will be great for your country&quot; that you&#39;re missing how horrible he&#39;ll be for the world. In case you&#39;ve forgotten, we&#39;re dealing with globalists here, and you&#39;re not doing your due diligence in investigating how much of a globalist institution (the Vatican&#39;s) man Trump is. </p>

<p>He will not make America great again. He will be your false peace anti-establishment candidate. Hope you enjoy your civil war. Might even get an opportunity to lynch some minorities if you&#39;re lucky eh fly.</p>

<p>We&#39;ve been there and done that man, it didn&#39;t work out too well.  Its proven to be just as corruptible as any other form of government, and less accountable.

<p>Why are you so desperate to cling to your power in this forum?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;m not,  I&#39;m answering this question separately because its complicated and doesn&#39;t need to be confused in a pile of information unrelated to the question.</p>

<p>So here it is,</p>

<p>Once upon a time <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> seemed to be doing very well, we had adapted to the latest attempts of &quot;the cabal&quot; to fundamentally chance the nature of conspiracy via &quot;hourly crossposting from communities who were strongly opposed to what we do here&quot;,</p>

<p>These communities had all but given up, and the modqueue had calmed down a lot.  Civil discussions were being had again.  So I resigned, I decided to let go and let the newer mods who were doing great take over and run the show.  Honestly modding this community is a pain in the ass, not fun at all, and littered with assholes who go off half-cocked about nonsense like mods needing to demod themselves for having an opinion.</p>

<p>So within a month or two of my resignation we had the Solidwhetstone drama where it appeared that SWS was attempting to make <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> &quot;reddit friendly&quot; and fundamentally change the nature of the sub... exactly what the mod team had been resisting from the start of this whole thing.</p>

<p>It seems silly but that&#39;s why I came back, That&#39;s why I won&#39;t leave again and That&#39;s it.</p>

<p>As far as &quot;power&quot; goes, If you think moderating a subreddit is a powerful position to be in, well... you&#39;ve rung the bell too many times.  </p>

<p>As a matter of fact, I&#39;ve taken great steps here, such as <a href="https://r.go1dfish.me/r/conspiracy/about/log">https://r.go1dfish.me/r/conspiracy/about/log</a> &lt;---This, to make sure that no single mod can use the only power a mod has (being a gatekeeper of information) without exposing themselves to the community in the same click of the remove button.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve been the only mod that I know of to create a community outreach sub (unless there is a secret one i wasn&#39;t invite to, LOL! totally possible!), as well as trying to get non mods interested in contributing to the community&#39;s wiki <a href="/r/conspiracy/wiki/index">/r/conspiracy/wiki/index</a></p>

<p>So like tits on a hog, while I might appear useless at first glance, I&#39;m vitally important to the development of the next generation of strong and self reliant swine.</p>

Ron Paul would&#39;ve been my choice and a truly great president, but he&#39;d never be able to do anything he wanted to do, unless a strong man (a la Trump) completely cleans house, and kicks out certain interests first. </p>

<p>..and who would those people be? As for the FF, I&#39;m aware. I&#39;m merely referencing Putin turning on his handlers. I do not condone the actions of Putin.</p>
