    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t know how anyone at this point couldn&#39;t at least admit something was fishy about 9/11.  I mean it goes much deeper than that, but your average person on the street probably doesn&#39;t even know a third tower fell that day, let alone that it was obviously a classical controlled demolition.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not quite ready to say no planes were used that day yet as some people are. But it&#39;s fairly obvious no plane hit the Pentagon for example.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m entirely uncertain about the third tower or the Pentagon aspects of the attacks, but I believe that there would be a ton of whistleblowers if the government really did the attack, and there are there are very few, and the few who mention it are usually ex-government for a long time beforehand. If Snowden, for example, were to expose it, I&#39;d believe it, as he&#39;s shown himself trustworthy in the past and was freshly ex-government (I think, can&#39;t remember) whenever he exposed the NSA.</p>
