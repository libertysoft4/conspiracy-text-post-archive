    <div class="md"><p>Well why don&#39;t other races care? Black people were protesting cop killings long before BLM was a buzz word. </p>

<p>Statistics suggest it&#39;s more of an issue towards black males regarding police brutality towards an unarmed suspect. And they never once said it&#39;s not at all a problem for other races. Plus the legislation they push to fix these issues benefit everybody (body cameras for starters although that&#39;s already been proven to be easily abused)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What makes you think other races don&#39;t care? Other races are being ostracized by being segregated by the group itself, the phrase BLM in itself is offensive, as if other lives don&#39;t matter. The group should be called SPB, Stop Police Brutality, problem solved.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>IMO it&#39;s doubtful. Police brutality for ALL people is a centuries old thing.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>How else do you explain the BLM movement becoming international almost over night.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Two reasons.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Twitter was nowhere near the source of news and social sharing that it is now back in 2008. Twitter is where the hashtag #BlackLivesMatter originated and where local level protestors organized and traded information. The ease of trading information on Twitter to grow the BLM cannot be understated. </p></li>
<li><p>The proliferation of smart phones with video cameras meant that many of hostile confrontations (regardless of who&#39;s right or wrong) were now recorded and released without Police being able to completely control the narrative. The visuals helped galvanize docile people into anger and action.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Beyond that, if I can just clear up a little thought process that you have that is misguided....</p>

<p>It&#39;s not (Only) Black Lives Matter...it&#39;s Black Lives Matter (too). Hopefully you can see the difference. Blacks aren&#39;t asking for special treatment, they&#39;re asking to be treated the same as everyone else. And that&#39;s been happening long before the media gave a shit. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>But really though, do any lives matter, a single death is a tragedy, a mass death is a statistic... I guess just living where I do you don&#39;t get treated differently by your race, but rather by how you dress, like you said it&#39;s an old thing, rich vs. poor, so it should be more like poor lives matter, but do they, really, do rich lives matter.... who is to say, my life doesn&#39;t matter to you, though you may respect life in general, you wouldn&#39;t be affected by mine ending, but other would be affected... as with everything it&#39;s a case by case basis... I hate the statement that one life is not more valuable than another... Which is the same as none have value... I don&#39;t know, complex shit.</p>

I&#39;m sure there was a whole lot of behind the scenes wheeling and dealing too and obama, now 8 years later, has proven himself a warmonger worthy of the presidency.</p>
