    <div class="md"><p>Forget the conspiracy, the real scandal and tragedy of Hillary political life is proven and sadly no one is talking about it. Her direct involvement in creating the civil war in Syria. There never was a popular uprising in Syria. But guess what, if you dump a shitload of money in a region to start a war. You get this mess we are stuck in. The refugees crisis in Europe which has as an after effect the rise of the right wings party throughout all European countries. Fuck this depressed me.</p>

<p>The refugee crisis which was <a href="https://sputniknews.com/world/20150917/1027135147/gaddafi-libya-refugees-exodus-arab-spring.html">accurately predicted by Gaddafi</a> months before Clinton pushed for the no-fly zone which would ultimately bring his death and the destabilization of Libya. They knew, or very well should have known, that taking out Gaddafi would lead to a refugee crisis in Europe. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Laureate should definitely be a bigger scandal, yet the problem is that it&#39;s a lot more difficult for the average person to understand than Trump U. Trump U is clearly a scam, a money-making venture built to capitalize on Trump&#39;s name and reputation to bilk people out of their money. I don&#39;t think this can really be doubted. Yet it&#39;s pretty straightforward, and not as much outright fraud as deceptive advertising and practices. Not good, but not that bad.</p>

<p>Laureate, on the other hand, represents a much more sinister scheme, but one that&#39;s much murkier and hard to unravel.  Bill was paid $17 million dollars over 5 years to be a figurehead &quot;Honorary Chancellor&quot; at Laureate, a multi-billion dollar private company that runs for-profit colleges around the world. In 2012, Laureate received $100 million in investment by the International Finance Committee, an organization which along with its sister organization the World Bank, is heavily supported by the US government. (<a href="http://washingtonbabylon.com/six-questions-for-charles-ortel-about-the-shady-university-that-paid-bill-clinton-17-million-to-be-its-honorary-chancellor/">See this Charles Ortel interview</a>. </p>

<p>There&#39;s not as big of a smoking gun here as with Trump U, and the Clinton&#39;s spin machine has been able to deflect much criticism of it. I think for this reason, it&#39;s been much less &quot;soundbite-able,&quot; yet I think it&#39;s a much more serious charge, as it amount to influence peddling at the State Department. Trump scammed money from unsuspecting dupes, which although despicable in its own right, is quite a different thing from selling influence of the US government. </p>
