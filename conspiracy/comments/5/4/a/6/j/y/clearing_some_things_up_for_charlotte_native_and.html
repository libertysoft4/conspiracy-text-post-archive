        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Ok, so this is all BS. Charlotte is not like this. Period. It actually breaks my heart when I see videos of people causing chaos in this city. </p>

<p>Lets start out with a culture perspective. My family has been here and helped fund and build Charlotte into what it is now. My family is Old money and my entire family tree is in NC. Charlotte has roots deeper than most realize. But if you come here, you see how its culture oozes and it infectious. Now considering how deep its support goes, financially and socially (which is why you need to know people to get good jobs) there is a network that All keeps up with this city and what goes on. My grandmother is a part of this. Dont get me wrong, im not what you would call rich, depends on what you consider rich I guess, but neither is my grandmother, she just comes from old money, and she knows Everyone or knows people who know people. Give or take.</p>

<p>Now the more cultured part that ties into the old money south theme. Its Very relaxed here. Very. Ive worked customer service in some of the richest parts here. I meet All kinds of people and by that, im suggesting ive gotten input from anyone who visits or has moved here. Everyone says the same thing. Its clean here, its beautiful, its relaxed, everyone is friendly, hell, well all love the cops, give or take, theyre cops so there is prejudice. But its peaceful. And considering all that and the mannerisms, its infectious. Tons of people make this place their home. John fox still lives here, steve smith still lives here. Ive seen brent stiner here, waka flaka, others as well. Michael jordan has a house here. Just theres a lot of people that call this place home. Now not to side track, i tell you about the people coming here to live because its a nice place and the culture goes back, far back. </p>

<p>Now all that being said, i will relate an event similar that will shed an example of this bs. Not too long ago, a year or two, same or similar thing happened. Apparently out of towners came in, not sc, but people came from like distances places, and they tried to start stuff. Get everyone riled up. The community here said no, we&#39;re not about that, dont start that crap here. And it didnt really blow up like this one is. So this whole community, we just dont do that crap. A little bias towards sc, but they dont do that crap either. </p>

<p>Now apart from cultural standpoint, there is a Lot going on here. The DNC was held here in 2012. Hb2 is still a story, we went to the super bowl last year, Bank of America is head quartered here. Not to mention charlotte is the second largest financial city next to New York. Also had a huge govt. bail out. A good bit of wells fargo runs here too. There is a lot of old money here, the belks, duke, lance, just a lot of people and cooperations, big film industry here. Sports, I also recently learned of a military contracted tech and research company here, northrop grumman. Theres just a Lot going on here. Its a pretty well Lit stage....</p>

<p>Thoughts, opinions? Added details, notes, or tidbits?</p>

<p>Also, sorry for the long post

    <div class="md"><p>Look. Im glad to be poor. My family is old money, but i am not. I would rather just be another person. I work my ass off for everything i have. But again, sitting in r/conspiracy and finding out the kinds of people and companies that the government has ties with now, it wouldnt surprise me. But you know, nothing is solid. Cops can be ass holes, so can people. No ones perfect, but i know amazing people and to say all cops are the same or all blacks, white, you just have to be an idiot to think that. There are exceptions. But regardless of stance, money does rule over a lot of people and communities. I dont know whos willing to do what for money. Or power, or whatever. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>There are neighborhoods with majority blacks yes. But you find that anywhere. Its not about segregation, it has nothing to do with that. The families that are in those places have been there for generations. There are plenty of mixed neighborhoods and class. The neighborhoods with &quot;segregation&quot; are the old houses from the 50s and 60s that have been there for forever. Retired folk, or families that have own the places. Otherwise its pretty well mixed. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>What do you mean it has nothing to do with segregation? You just said the families have been in that area for generations. Wouldn&#39;t that mean that generations ago there was no integration, races were separated into neighborhoods, and that still exists to this day?</p>

<p>You have to admit the good ,bad and ugly if you want to clear up your city. Your perspective seems to be only in the good. Charlotte, if anything, probably has more separation than some other cities due to the reason that a corporate bank is headquartered there, and a bunch of super rich people inhabit the place. </p>

I have no idea, but its not about segregation, its about the communities. We have hispanic communities too. But the rest of charlotte is mixed. And as far as the super rich, they keep all the mansions whatever.

    <div class="md"><p>Maybe lower, middle, upper classes are segregation? Ever think of that?
The majority of blacks, Hispanics , are in the lower class. That is a segregated community. Segregated by race, and class.</p>

<p>Let&#39;s stop talking about your dad. Segregation, this is the overall issue. Your city is a typical segregated American city. What would you like to clear up?</p>

Stereotypes of the south combined with recent unrest and propaganda have painted the city in a negative light.

<p>Since Charlotte had this happen, that means there was enough people who feel there is an &#39;unfairness,&#39;  and this most likely has been brewing for a while. Op, only seeing the wealthy perspective, is probably not seeing all of what is happening to lead up to such a mass protest and demonstration of authority. So maybe he will understand more of what is going on.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I brought up old money to show stabilization in the culture here. Its been a lax place. The money that builds the foundation here keeps everything at bay. It means that since there is enough support in this city, it means that no one should suffer or feel out of place. Its like the foundations are laid, its a sensible place, and it stays that way because the old money were actually sensible people. Theres plenty of work here, so people can get jobs, as well, im not looking from a wealthy standpoint. Im looking from a culture that built this city stand point. Im broke as shit. I grew up in poverty if that means anything. Ive had money, ive also actually been homeless, but im grateful for the people in this city who are more than willing to love and lend an ear to whatever is going on. And no, unrest isnt building. We dont have the same problems. The issues we do have are housing. Too many new condos and housing going up, but thats a separate issue. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Segregation is a common sense observation on my part.</p>

<p>Instead of being a tour guide for the rich and famous, do you also avoid sensitive subjects in your spare time? Or maybe your just oblivious of the caste system. Regardless if there are some rich minorities, they make up the lowest percentile of the lower class. Classes being a segregation; our society is economically segregated.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I dont avoid it, im tired of seeing something that is non sense. Im not saying that it doesnt exist, some people can be &quot;racists&quot; but when you blow up the matter and make it something we should all be worried about, just stop making it the issue. There are far more important things to be concerned about. And if you actually were doing your job as a human being and stopped looking for whats wrong with everyone else and started focusing on your own duties, you might understand what actually is priority i life. The way i see it, were all humans who work or should work, and well anything i come across personally that i cant avoid or that im directly faced with, i see it as an opportunity to grow. Im not going to demonize anyone, and yes, those who are ass holes should learn the responsibilities they have to everyone else on the planet but treating people like ass holes or implicating theyre trash isnt how you change anything. It makes situations worse. It doesnt do anyone good. Actions do have consequences, but making a deal out of a &quot;problem&quot; isnt going to help. Do what you are able and move on. You cant fix people. No one can. Everyone makes their own choices. Unfortunately not all choices are right. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>So do you agree with the idea floating around here that the majority of these rioters were bussed into the town in an artificial attempt at inciting riots and civil unrest? Do you think there&#39;s an ulterior motive behind the sudden flare of chaos that may involve a concentrated effort to use this week&#39;s volatile events as an excuse to bring in more militarized police or possibly to detract from another more pressing issue that would otherwise comprise the media&#39;s time had these riots not taken place at all? I actually read in a few places that following our bombing/murder of the Syrian forces that many folks were honestly expecting another BLM-pushed riot somewhere to grab everyone&#39;s attention. Then Charlotte happened. How do you feel about that?</p>

<p>I also read that there were actually several very peaceful marches and protests that took place this week that didn&#39;t get much-- if any-- coverage by the usual major networks (CNN/FOX/MSNBC/etc.). Can you confirm this?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yea. Word was that people were coming here from out of town to stir shit up. And as ive said, it breaks my heart to see our city shown in this way. Its not who we are, period. We are being depicted in a horrible way. I see the videos of protestors on the highways doing stuff to cars... you Never see that here. As well, peaceful protests, sure. Only what people have told me. The whole blm movement or whatever. We still dont have a lot of protests either. I mean in ferguson, those protests became more mild as well. I would think we may have calmed down all the rioting, but we dont really protest much anymore as far as i know. </p>

<p>My dad just told me too, when mlk got shot and the country was in upheaval, we were calm from what he tells me. And before anyone says thats because its the south, no, the black community is Just as important contributor to building this city as well. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Im just tired of seeing this bs happen. I know my city isnt capable of this crap. We dont want any part of it. And it breaks my heart to see it honestly. I kinda feel bad now though, ferguson, all the other cities, i wonder what they are really like. </p>

<p>As far as funding goes. Who knows who directly pays for it all. Soros, sure, but who else, i have no idea. Government of parties do whatever they want. Unfortunately. </p>
