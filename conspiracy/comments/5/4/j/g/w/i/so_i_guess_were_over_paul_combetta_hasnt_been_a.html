    <div class="md"><p>Nothing will happen.  If he is a no show the house wishes to charge him with contempt of congress and votes in favor of that then the matter  is passed to the US attorney office.  The US  attorney office can then bring it before a federal judge.  The problem is that this guy was granted immunity by the DOJ.  The US attorney office  is under control of the DOJ. </p>

<p>On top of that members of Congress have threaten many witnesses with contempt citations in the past but have very, very rarely ever followed through.  Also actual convictions for contempt charges are even rarer  (rarer, is that even a word?  It looks weird). I believe the last such conviction was in the 70&#39;s or  80&#39;s and the most recent time before that was in the 50&#39;s. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, the suspect <em>has</em> to talk with the FBI, but that&#39;s different from having to testify in front of Congress.</p>

<p>In this case, those with immunity are being used as human shields for Hillary: they&#39;re taking the fall for her crimes knowing they can&#39;t be prosecuted for doing so. This is the <em>opposite</em> effect of what immunity should do (which in most cases, is to embolden the person to throwing the actual perp under the bus)... but since everyone has their story straight and people are too afraid of getting a barbell dropped on their neck, then immunity has thus far been useless.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Yes, but for court cases not Congressional inquires.  The DOJ is viewing the congressional investigation as a witch hunt.  No matter how you feel about the whole e-mail thing the DOJ is right.  Paul was given immunity during the FBI investigation in case the investigation turned in to a court case. FBI could not find enough to build a case with.  An immunity deal in this case is doing what a immunity deals are suppose to do and protecting the person.  Congress is not part of the DOJ/court system so of course the deal is protecting Paul from a political witch hunt.  What some in Congress are trying to do is the reverse of how the system is suppose to work.  They are trying to investigate a matter after the DOJ have already past on the case and trying to act as a defacto court system.  DOJ does not like it when congress pretends they are the DOJ,  separation of powers is important.  How it is suppose to work would be congress holding an investigation/inquire to uncover enough evidence  so that the DOJ could be alerted and do real investigation, but if the DOJ has already done a real investigation and found nothing to build a soild case out of then what congress is doing is completely pointless at this time. Hence political witch hunt like Benghazi.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Lol but you&#39;re basing the entire thing based off of the fact that the FBI investigation somehow managed to miss that Mr.Combetta has used the same username for likely many different things. I&#39;ve had friends that have had FBI backround checks when applying and they do not fuck around. </p>

<p>So youre saying that you truly believed that the country responsible for wiretapping there own fucking people had nooo idea Paul was (as one redditor put it) posting pictures of him smoking weed with his dog???  Using the same username as his goddamn email??? If youre willing to accept that the FBI investigation had absolutely zero backroom deals, zero dialogues left out, than I highly encourage you to open your mind. </p>

<p>I think if anything congress is fed up with its completely open corruption and partiality in this investigation. I believe one and highly respected member of congress said something like &quot;no wonder the investigation went nowhere, they gave everyone immunity!&quot;. Good for them, its time to shame these piecesof shit in front of the entire world.</p>

<p>Guess I&#39;m downvoted. How much of am obvious $hill is this?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ya know if you (everyone enraged about this shit, myswlf included) just assemble an organization and get it to be recognised by the us govt you can get a lot more done than expecting everyone else to fix this. No ONE is going to do anything. Everyone has to do something. An organization with members and employees is what is needed. All i see is outrage. Get past step one... channel that outrage. Organize.</p>

<p>If there is a civil rights issue. Theres an organization for that. If there&#39;s a breach in the law, there&#39;s a branch of govt for that.</p>

<p>When the govt runs amuk. There... uh.. &quot;lets just bitch about it online. Lets say we&#39;re trying to raise awareness!&quot;</p>

<p>Well everyone knows the system is fucked. What now? Organize. Make it your new job and live off of donations to keep it running. We pay taxes to go to bullshit. I think people en mass would gladly pay a monthly donation to help keep a legitimate organization like that in business. The trick is actually doing the job effectively and not taking the mo ey and running with it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve always thought that.  Almost like a legitimate spokesman for the people. The downside being that if even one flame of revolution started anywhere,  gov would crush everything to do with them as a warning. I think more like anonymous protests in every city in the country (maybe the world). Id donate to the &quot;mail every person in the world a guy fawkes mask&quot; in a heartbeat. The problem with organizing being its easier to single out the organizers. I think rather than convincing people to join a group, we bring the group to them. I mean, you know how idiots work. They have a v mask, their friends do too, people are protesting wearing masks &quot;HEY LETS BE PART OF THE CROWD&quot;. Its only human nature to so what everyone else is doing, the America revolution should be the coolest fucking thing going on necessary. </p>

<p>That being said i think it would be very important to have a very open discussion with everyone in the country about what we want out of it. The demands to prevent any unnecessary escalation resulting in catastrophy. Look at the ukranian revolution  (Netflix winter on fire), they handled that with more grace and beauty than i could have imagined. I would only hope the American revolution would be more about holding ground and demanding changes on the steps of congress. </p>
