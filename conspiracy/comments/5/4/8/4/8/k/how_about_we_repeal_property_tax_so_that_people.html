You can either pay taxes and get fire protection or pay a fire insurance plan. They already do stuff like this with cops. If you have an alarm system you have to pay more because of the frequent police calls.</p>

<p>But everyone has labor. Only the first person to get there (and kill off whoever was already there) benefits from the application of violence to protect property.</p>

<p>You mixing your labor with the land was basically you setting out booby traps, knowing that you could then hurt anyone who touches them.</p>

<p>What was to stop the first monkey to walk upright from blowing some dust into the wind and saying &quot;anyone who steps on this dust mixed with my labor gets killed&quot;?</p>

<p>Your logic is just terrible. Most of the world&#39;s population is landless and living in poverty, and you blithely claim that there is plenty of land for everyone. As if gutter children in Brazil can simply score some free land in the Yukon.</p>

Property taxes are NOT necessary, they are modern serfdom and people like you enable the parasitic class to get away with it. Try educating yourself on a subject before making claims about it. As an aside why is there a gas tax to fund road maintenance when state taxes supposedly fund that as well? I doubt you even realize what you pay in tax and what those taxes are allocated for.

You know the deal, we need a park so everyone should have to pay, even though I will never visit the park. When they do these votes I just want everyone in my city to vote and have their property linked with their vote. If they want the park, the ones who voted for it pay for it.

    <div class="md"><p>So basically, you want to live in a community and not contribute to the community. Let me break this down, you are not an island. No matter what you think, you share this space with others. You may not use the new park, but you damn sure benefit from value that the park adds to your community. You indirectly benefit from this. Just the simple fact that there is a nice new park in your community improves the valuations of your property.  What about the ancillary benefits, that gives options to kids who might otherwise participate in more nefarious behavior if that park was not present?  </p>

<p>I don&#39;t know where you live, but there is probably unincorporated areas somewhere near you. You could move there to lower your tax burden. </p>

<p>I have a few questions, what do you do if you have a fire? Can the closest fire department bill you directly for their services? What about the closest police department? Can they do the same? Can I assume you have a well and a septic tank as well? Also do you have 4WD, cause that dirt road is going to be pretty rough? </p>

<p>No one likes taxes, especially taxes on things that you have already paid for. However, you are getting a really good fucking deal. Imagine if fire departments and police departments billed you directly. That could get really expensive really quickly. This shit works in small towns and the reason it works is because the head of the volunteer fire department is your cousin. He&#39;d be helping your put out some random brush fire anyway and hes family so of course hes going to help you and not try to fuck you over. That park that your neighbors wanted to build, it would get built even though you don&#39;t use it. Why? Because its for your nephews and grandchildren and your neighbors are your brothers, sisters, cousins, aunts and uncles. So you are going to build that shitty rinkydink track for your nephews to race their dirt bikes and go-carts. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Property tax? Not the issue.</p>

<p>1427 NE Holland St,
Portland, OR 97211
3 beds 1 bath 1,501 sqft</p>

<p>FOR SALE: $320,000</p>

<p>Last sold: Apr 1994 for $23,000</p>

<p>Property Tax: 2013  $1,077  -25.8%  $44,630 -30.9%</p>

<p>Taxing this property as if it were $44K. As it should be. </p>

<p>Property tax rates are going down. It&#39;s the <em>price</em> of property that is stratospheric - and this is the banks doing. First they gambled with the home markets until they crashed the economy- driving up property prices along the way. And now the banks are making a killing on the interest rates being charged. </p>

<p>If I live on undeveloped land that I personally improve through my labor and capital without utilizing and public infrastructure not already funded by a tax then property tax is unecessary and serfdom. </p>

<p>And if I want to travel across that land unmolested, no one will hurt me right?</p>
