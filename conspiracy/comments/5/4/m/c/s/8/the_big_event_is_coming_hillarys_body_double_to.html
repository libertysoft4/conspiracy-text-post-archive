        <p><span class="badge badge-primary">48</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;2016-09-26 by <a class="author" href="../../../../../../../../user/CIAParadoxRocks.html">CIAParadoxRocks</a></p>
        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>It&#39;s over for Hillary Clinton. No matter how much the establishment media’s propaganda machine demonizes Trump, and no matter how much the federal government (DHS) is able to manipulate the voting machines in swing states to shift the count in her favor (as the DNC did to steal the primary from Bernie), it’s no longer going to be enough for Hillary to rig the election. HRC is in free fall, her failing health has derailed her campaign and her escalating unpopularity is so widespread now that there’s simply nothing that her corporate donors and political power brokers can do to rig the system enough to get her into the White house.</p>

<p>Moreover, it’s also clear that Hillary’s so-called “pneumonia” diagnosis was a barely concealed disguise for a far more grave and serious medical illness (e.g. her traumatic brain injury, transverse sinus thrombosis, subsequent symptoms, falling, passing out and now the obvious problem with eye movement are all fact, not speculation). Even if the corporate power elites that financed and sponsored her campaign stayed the course and played every dirty trick in the book to pull the strings in her favor, the cold hard truth is that Hillary’s dying, even if elected she’s not going to last 4 years anyway. She may not even make it until November.</p>

<p>In other words, Hillary is now a liability to the globalist agenda of her corporate donors. And if we grant that the power elites of neo-liberal globalism will stop at nothing to control the outcome of this election, then it’s only to be expected that Hillary Clinton’s powerful and well-financed corporate owners are right now figuring out how to exploit her looming death in a way that can both serve their globalist agenda, while also defeating Trump&#39;s national populist anti-establishment uprising. For who in today&#39;s post-9/11 world would still deny that the powerful vested interests in corporate and political establishment might decide to intervene in this election in a violent way to deal with the looming threat of Trump’s anti-establishment movement, and to advance their overriding agenda for a one world government?</p>

<p>So how could the globalist’s turn this crisis into an opportunity? How can they benefit from Hillary&#39;s demise and immanent death in a way that serves the political theatrics necessary to provide a further justification for the neo-liberal globalist agenda of the corporate elites?</p>

<p>The answer is both shocking and yet obvious: in collaboration with the deep state’s intelligence agencies (CIA), the globalist’s will orchestrate the public assassination of one of Hillary&#39;s body doubles in a staged or false flag event, and then blame it on one of Trump&#39;s &quot;basket of deplorable&#39;s&quot; i.e. by framing an unhinged Oswald-like pro-Trump white supremacist as their designated CIA patsy.</p>

<p>This staged assassination will then enable the neo-liberal globalist’s (in collaboration with the corporate mainstream media) to frame all those supporting Trump&#39;s national populist uprising as guilty by association, thereby ensuring that pro-Trump white nationalists are designated as dangerous extremists, and a threat to national security. Hillary&#39;s (false flag) assassination will then be used as a pretext for declaring martial law, which will result in the immediate suspension of the election, just when a Trump victory seems guaranteed – a strategic move that is designed to send all Trumps supporters into collective outrage, unleashing social chaos, and mass civil unrest.</p>

<p>But that reaction is, of course, precisely what the power elite of the globalist agenda want. Hillary is dead, Trump inspired her &quot;lone nut&quot; killer, and with the election suspended there&#39;s also mass protests and riots. The political establishment will have no choice but to call for a state of emergency, which further justifies the need to enforce the national security apparatus of a militarized police state to restore peace and stability, which comes to the rescue to console the grieving liberals and progressives in the wake of Hillary’s assassination by violently clamping down on any civil unrest from the &quot;racist&quot; and &quot;bigoted&quot; white nationalist extremists.</p>

<p>And so with the deep states almost laughably predictable &quot;problem-reaction-solution&quot; false flag event, the deep state power elites will be able to bring order out of chaos, and shift the dominant political narrative away from Trump&#39;s right-wing populism and back towards the political establishment&#39;s globalist agenda (endless unwinnable wars in the Middle East, the obscene greed of neo-liberal capitalist economics and the Trojan horse terror threat of open-border multiculturalism), free again to move ahead with their unflinching plans for a one world government...</p>

<p>In the meantime, the real and very sick Hillary has gone underground and away from the public spotlight for good, to see out her last days in palliative care as she suffers through the last stages of Parkinson&#39;s disease. But for so long as she goes along with this deep state false flag operation to assassinate one of her body doubles, then she’ll be able to live out her last days in relative peace and seclusion, with the consolation of knowing that her political legacy still intact - for her publicly staged death also constitutes an irrevocable guarantee that all the corruption scandals, criminal charges and looming FBI indictments against her have been dropped, once and for all.</p>

Fuck I remember when Obama was running for re-election he was supposedly going to all: be murdered, have members of his immediate family killed but escape himself, nuke the super bowl in Denver, suspend all future elections, take everyones guns, put us in FEMA camps, too many things to list. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Nobody realises that the secret service are essential FED cops. Their first order of business is counterfeit currency, IE ensuring that no dollars are issued except those issued by the FED.

<p>The SS. </p>

<p>The secret fucking police people. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>High crimes and treason ? If this is true then people deserves to know what are those crimes and treason you are talking about. Because in a &quot;normal democracy&quot; a candidate running for presidency  should not be taken out the presential race based on a &quot;executive order&quot;, &quot;secret service&quot; or such &quot;things&quot; without even people knowing what are the &quot;true reasons&quot;.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Puting out of the race one of the 2 major presidential candidates for unknown / non public / shady / deep state / special interest group of people / non legal (legal means based on a trial, and not a &quot;secret&quot; one) reasons is a facist (for the least) or even nazi (at &quot;worst&quot;) alike method. You cannot justify this type of behavior. Period. If HRC is/was indeed guilty of real/obvious high crimes and treason as you accuse her, I guess we would all know about those by now from the mass media, also  she would have faced a trial most probably and certainly she would have been impeached to run for presidency from the start. Her responsability in Bengasi catastrophe was bs, email server story bs too and obviously she cannot be held responsible/accountant for all the messy finance of the so called democratic party. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Many people (and I am part of them) do actualy believe that the Hillary we see since 9/11/2016 could be not the real Hillary but a/several body double. If this is indeed true, then the real Hillary has been jeopardized for some &quot;reason&quot;, thus my concerns. This is what I meant by &quot;puting out of the race&quot;. Also I personaly doubt a &quot;real Hillary&quot; would have accepted/could accept to participate a staged election even if she was forced to (unless maybe in regard to a major staged world event, something really special like aliens coming to Earth or some shit like that), so maybe &quot;they&quot; had to replace her in &quot;emergency&quot;.</p>
