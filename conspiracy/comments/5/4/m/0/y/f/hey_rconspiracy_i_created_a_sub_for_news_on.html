        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>There&#39;s a lot of good news out there that occasionally hits the front page from here that is actually quite relevant and real. But coming from a place called r/conspiracy might turn a lot of people off from the validity of the news. </p>

<p>I&#39;m hoping I can build this sub to be the next r/uncensorednews, but with less racism and bias. I want this place to be THE place for all news on Reddit, no filter, no bias, no secrets. So hopefully when news breaks out and r/politics or r/news is removing posts again our sub will show what they&#39;ve been trying to suppress. </p>

<p>So please join me in supporting this endeavor. We need numbers to make an impact. </p>

Like r/inthenews, r/betternews, r/truenews there are about a billion of them by now, and all of them were created with the same exact goal, at least until the owners bias or mod bias creeps in. Also any Alt-Right fuckhead is just going to argue that their racism/sexism/islamophobia/etc. is their freedom of speech and the next thing you know you&#39;re a &quot;shill&quot; &quot;SJW&quot; &quot;Cuck&quot; &quot;Leftist&quot;&quot;Libtard&quot; etc. for not allowing it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Why isn&#39;t racism/sexism/islamophobia/etc &quot;free&quot; speech? Offensive ideas, ideas that are &quot;wrong&quot;, speak for themselves and shouldn&#39;t be censored. If someone wants to deny the Holocaust happened, fine, good for them, because the same right that allows them to deny the Holocaust allows me to explain to them why they are wrong. By censoring &quot;offensive&quot; and racist ideas we force them underground and allow intolerance and hatred to breed behind the scenes. These ideas fester, they become like an infection, and the corruption spreads. By keeping them in the open, where the sun can shine on them, we insure the infection doesn&#39;t spread.</p>
