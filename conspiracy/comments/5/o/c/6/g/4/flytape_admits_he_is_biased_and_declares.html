<blockquote>
<p>Dusty I&#39;ve tried to remain your friend throughout your Conspiracy mod meltdown where you wanted to remove/tag every post that wasn&#39;t backed up by the MSM.</p>

<p>Since that exit you&#39;ve become increasingly hard to tolerate, let alone forgive and file in &quot;agree to disagree&quot;.</p>

<p>Now you&#39;ve pretty much fully turned on me, you may as well be <a href="/u/thefuckingtoe">/u/thefuckingtoe</a>.</p>

<p>I recused myself, without anyone else&#39;s urging, from modding anything election related for the entirety of the election. It was a principled stance and I appreciate that you recognize it as such. However, the election is over now and the stupid BuzzFeed post that was removed, was removed because it was a sewage spill of a brigade. It spilled into <a href="/r/Conspiracy">/r/Conspiracy</a> <strong>the worst kind of Reddit liberals</strong> who immediately were breaking all of our rule and not giving a shit about it because they don&#39;t plan on being in Conspiracy next week and could care less if they are banned.</p>

<p>Oh and I also tagged it a fucking hoax because I saw splinters of this report on 4chan months ago!</p>

<p>So the problem was that we suddenly had thousands of non /Conspiracy users shitting all over the place, refusing to comply with the rules and violating reddit&#39;s ToS by virtue of participation in the brigade.</p>

<p>So if you want to start acting like a pissant towards me then stop pretending like it&#39;s not because you&#39;re just another anti-trump zealot who is bent of of shape.</p>

<p><strong>Why does Conspiracy favor Trump</strong>?</p>

<p>Well let&#39;s look at the obvious,</p>

<p>He calls out the MSM on an almost daily basis,</p>

<p>He claims to want to audit the Fed,</p>

<p>He claims to want to drain the swamp (yeah yeah look at his appointments),</p>

<p>He killed two political dynasty (Clintons and Bushes),</p>

<p>He isn&#39;t politically correct (people are tired of this nonsense),</p>

<p>He talks about 9-11 Conspiracy and other Conspiracy,</p>

<p>He gutted the Republican party and caused the DNC to virtually self destruct.</p>

<p>Of course people in /Conspiracy have a little hope that he will make good on some of his promises, even you admitted that you &quot;hope&quot; he does.</p>

<p>But taking shit I said about recusing myself from modding during the election out of context and pretending like I recused myself for life is fucking ridiculous. You&#39;re trying to hold my feet to the fire for bias in removing a post that was actually removed because of a massive unending brigade that destroyed the whole sub until it was removed.</p>

<p>You clearly don&#39;t have a clue what you&#39;re talking about in this case and I would appreciate if you would not bandwagon me with the anti-trump people.</p>

<p>He adheres to dividing us between partisan lines and favors politicians instead of remaining steadfast skeptical. Does this look like a conspiracy type of person to you? A free thinker?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>But it&#39;s not gossip, it&#39;s the truth.  It&#39;s interesting to me when people choose to put people like her on a pedestal.  If you read about it, you&#39;ll find that BJs are why she had any renown in Hollywood whatsoever, and why she had a minor acting career.  She certainly wasn&#39;t a looker, not ever.  So, in a real way, she met RR because they were both &quot;actors&quot;.  She was really a consort, or someone who gets ahead by the oldest profession known to mankind.  It worked out well for her.  Sorry that the truth is so offensive.  Mankind really needs to let go of worshiping people in power.  It sets us back.  They are only people, not royalty.</p>

<p>Oh, I disagree.  Many have.  That&#39;s why, on a Saturday night no less, people behaved like prudes and downvoted the topic.  We can talk about raping babies all fucking day long around here, but no one better besmirch the memory of that witch, even if it&#39;s factual.</p>

<p>If you look into the topic, you&#39;ll find she sometimes would go cruising around with two men, and blow whichever wasn&#39;t driving.  I find that information slightly amusing because she was the &quot;say no to drugs&quot; bitch I remember from childhood.  I lived through the Reagan administration, and I feel I&#39;ve earned this one shout-out to Nancy&#39;s memory.  Also, she loved blowing hollywood execs, but the secretaries weren&#39;t fond of cleaning the condoms out of their bosses&#39; trash can after her visits.  </p>

Why do you feel it&#39;s petty unless you harbor some admiration for her?  Fuck her, she was a terrible person.  Her cocksucking days pale in comparison to her other character flaws.  It&#39;s ultimately humanizing to tell the truth.  And come on, it really is hilarious and ironic that she went on to dictate behavior of any sort.</p>

<p>That&#39;s why I posted it.  Real life is often kind of dirty.  People often get ahead, (ahem) for not-so-nice reasons in this world.  She&#39;s dead, so is he, for a nice long while now so it should be okay to talk about.</p>

<p>Why are you doing this? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Why did you try to spread disunity amongst the mods and turn the sub into actualconspiracies?<br/>
Why did you actively try to turn the users against the mods with a sustained attack campaign because you didn&#39;t get your way?<br/>
Why do you even have copies of the modlogs? That really looks suspicious if you claim to have been acting in the better interests of the sub. </p>

<p>Basically you really pissed me off man. You wouldn&#39;t let it lie and accept majority decision. The sub functions best with hands-off moderation IMO, letting the users decide what to think for themselves, and almost all of the modteam agreed with this. It&#39;s the core strength of the sub and why people like it, change that basic format and it&#39;ll be degraded and just another over-controlled reddit space. The freedom to speak your mind when your opinion is unpopular (or even wrong) is a rare thing these days and I support it wholeheartedly.  </p>

<p>I am sorry for getting a bit shitty last night though, I went too far and I really shouldn&#39;t comment when I&#39;ve had a few beers... </p>

<p>This has nothing to do with conspiracies. It&#39;s childish.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Sounds great but impossible to uphold in practice. Everyone is biased, I would prefer if that bias was at a minimum but it gets hard when your dealing with large communities of people. Especially when your sub gets flooded by people looking for a new safe space.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>He calls out anyone that doesn&#39;t like him and then cites fake news cites to back him up.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And in effect this leads to him calling out the main stream media... </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Claims =/= action. He&#39;s already lied.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>While I doubt he will, you can atleast give the man a chance to be president before saying he isn&#39;t taking action.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;yeah yeah,&quot; he lied.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes he did, but he still made the claim which resonated with a lot of conspiracy folk.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Voters did this, not him. It&#39;s not hard to win against the most corrupt dem in history. Any of the republicans would have won.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Anyone else probably could, but they didn&#39;t.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>He is on video re-affirming the msm 911 narrative about jet fuel. He won&#39;t dig into this. Only the green party digs into it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>He claimed he would release more classified documents and said something along the lines of &quot;you will find out who knocked down the towers, you might think it was the Saudi&#39;s, but you&#39;ll find out&quot;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Repubs are stronger than ever... </p>
</blockquote>

<p>I think people just like the fact that even the republicans didn&#39;t want trump to win.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The wikileaks put the DNC on blast. What the hell does trump have to do with it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Oh I must have imagined the 90% of trumps campaign that was spend bashing Hillary about her servers and the leaks.</p>

<p>Yes and I don&#39;t think they had a right to the country back then. But that was back then, like it or not what happened happened and it was at a time where doing so wasn&#39;t internationally illegal.</p>

<p>I get that you don&#39;t like Trump, that&#39;s absolutely fine! I get that I removed a hit piece on Trump and it knee jerk looks like bias because I&#39;m a Trump Supporter.</p>

<p>But what you don&#39;t get is that hundreds and people who don&#39;t like this place were pouring through the gates, breaking our rules, shit posting and &quot;pooping on our sidewalks&quot;, they had no intentions of having a conversation or even examining the profoundly exotic and unverifiable claims made by BuzzFeed.  Hundreds of people per hour that were instantly hitting our mod queue for openly breaking every rule we have.</p>

<p>I deleted the post to salvage this place for the people who actually use it and care about it.</p>

<p>Now about my bias, I recused myself during the election from moderating any presidential politics because I DID have a bias.  I stuck to that stubbornly during the election so that I wouldn&#39;t be gate keeping/shape keeping the info available here for people to base their vote on.  </p>

<p>The election is over now, Trump won.  Now I want the political penis stretching to go back to normal levels, it&#39;s no longer a contest!</p>

<p>Once Trump is the president and start inevitably doing stupid shit worthy of criticism I won&#39;t delete any of it for being against Trump.  If it fails our community for some other reason it shouldn&#39;t be immune from the rules.</p>

Because Trump has actual connections to Russia in the form of hundreds of millions of dollars in business and a shared neoliberal trade and resource extraction interest. That totally unverified story threatened to become the narrative of Trump&#39;s Russian ties and so would have been celebrated as &quot;the end of the narrative&quot; when (if? Probably when) disproven. No one needs that.</p>

<p>I will say it&#39;s a bit ridiculous that conspiracy theorists (which presumably <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> is), who pride themselves on skepticism, would go for the guy who promises revolution and then delivers authoritarian crackdown but I think what conspiracy theorists have in common is neither craziness nor skepticism (nor intelligence nor stupidity), but a feeling of loss of control over their lives. That&#39;s why the fascist shtick works with you guys, it sounds powerful and righteous because it wants a monoculture and is willing to do anything to get it and that&#39;s empowering in a sadistic, backwards, resentful kind of way.</p>
