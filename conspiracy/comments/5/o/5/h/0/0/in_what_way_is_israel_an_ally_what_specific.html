I get they are sensitive and defensive as they&#39;ve been hunted through the years but it now seems like the bullied is now the bully.</p>

<p>That&#39;s odd, I seem to recall Israeli&#39;s rather openly threatening the lives of the BDS leaders.  BDS is about boycotting Apartheid like treatment.  How is a boycott wrong.  If you don&#39;t agree with something you should be able to avoid trade with that entity.  Somehow Israel is making that illegal, in various places around the world.  So, which side is provoking?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t recall Israel threatening the lives of BDS leaders. I&#39;d like to see a link if you have it. But that is very wrong of Israel if that is true.</p>

<p>A boycott is OK, but the BDS movement takes it much further.  The group demonizes Israel and doesn&#39;t honestly describe the situation on the ground.</p>

<p>I have other issues with it. Mainly I believe that the boycott and anti Israel rhetoric the BDS movement condones will never lead to peace. It will only encourage extremism on both sides.</p>

<p>These are just three, and it took me seconds.  The last one is from Amnesty International.</p>

<p>Maybe now you could explain how a boycott is in any way &quot;extremism&quot;?  I know Jews take money very seriously, but a boycott is one of the most basic of human rights.  Maybe you could also explain how you would feel if after over 70 years of being treated as the Jews were in the Warsaw Ghetto, how you refrain from being uncivil?  There are roughly 10 killed Palestinians to ONE Israeli.  How is it Israel is always the victim?</p>

<p>PS, I always hear this touted by online defenders.  I&#39;m sorry that these people just refuse to die easily for the Israelis.  Hey, maybe they could just set up some ovens, or gas chambers?  They&#39;ve already become the nazi&#39;s, quite a while ago.  Look at how one sided our press is, and it has been since about the 1980&#39;s.  Israeli&#39;s by and large view themselves as superior, and the Palestinians as animals.</p>

<p>I absolutely know the level of questionable Israeli activity including involvement in the forming of ISIS. I&#39;m just trying to figure out if the people who are running the country aren&#39;t actually trying to sabotage their own establishment. If they are, someone else is puppeting them.</p>

He and Ehud Barak, Richard Perle etc, are also instrumental in 9/11, along with the Bush administration, to promote a never-ending war on terror, which is really a war to destroy all of Israels enemies.</p>

<p>Stop with your lies.  They aren&#39;t &quot;sabotage their own establishment.&quot;  What they <em>are</em> are zionist fascists.</p>

<p>These are just three, and it took me seconds.  The last one is from Amnesty International.</p>

<p>Maybe now you could explain how a boycott is in any way &quot;extremism&quot;?  I know Jews take money very seriously, but a boycott is one of the most basic of human rights.  Maybe you could also explain how you would feel if after over 70 years of being treated as the Jews were in the Warsaw Ghetto, how you refrain from being uncivil?  There are roughly 10 killed Palestinians to ONE Israeli.  How is it Israel is always the victim?</p>
