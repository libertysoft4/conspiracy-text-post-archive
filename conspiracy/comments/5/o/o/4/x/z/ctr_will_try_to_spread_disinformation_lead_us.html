        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>This discussion forum is a great tool for us to communicate and spread information through social media. The establishment is obviously well aware of this, and they have an internet troll campaign (as we all know) that has aggressively infiltrated this sub as of lately. My honest opinion is that once the Pizzagate stuff leaked, they kicked it into overdrive and hired a ton more units and they are becoming more sophisticated in their methods of distracting and suppressing is. </p>

<p>They are trying to turn this place into a real life ADHD of random half truth conspiracies and arguments ect. Don&#39;t let them do it. Ignore the stupid shit and the stuff that you know is purposely antagonistic (trying to start shit, purposely creating an environment where we will fight each other.) the shills are trying to split us up and pit us against each other, c&#39;mon you guys know this. Stick to your gut, you guys know what is bullshit and what is real deep down. Anything anti-Semitic is gonna be obvious trolling to make us look bad. I believe they are also trying to create the impression that this sub is <strong>half trump, half not</strong>, to create hostility between us and make us think in absolutes, for trump or not. Whether you support trump or not, we all share common ideals and a skepticism toward authority. We must work together and refine our approach toward spreading information and communicating and discussing our situation. </p>

<p>Anything that paints us in a negative light to newcomers is their goal, they want to make this place seem wacky and insane since we are getting all of this new traffic. Maintain an impression of being a well mannered, thoughtful discussion forum where ideas are exchanged in a civil and constructive manner. Don&#39;t let these fuckers disrupt our flow. </p>

<p>Keep in mind this is a business. These guys communicate with one another and they asses the discussion forum, target certain members, find weaknesses and just generally create a bunch of distractions, try to add credibility to those distractions by upvoting or down voting  comments that praise or attack certain claims they propose. There is a lot of money involved in these campaigns, these guys are organized and correlated, they network with one another and they can&#39;t be underestimated. We need to stand together against them, to try and lessen the amount of damage they can do to our discussion forum. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>And that&#39;s to be expected. We know that not everyone supports or is familiar with the details of pizzagate, especially outside of this sub. We welcome honest debate about any subject, but the actions of people like arrest_hillary_now are not normal, nor do they add to the discussion of trying to determine what&#39;s possible and what&#39;s improbable.</p>

<p>Anyway, welcome to our sub!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I look for what makes sense. Sometimes the official story makes sense, sometimes it doesn&#39;t. In the case of Pizzagate, the official story makes way more sense. I&#39;ve yet to see a single piece of evidence that didn&#39;t fall apart when I actually looked at it and applied critical thinking. Laura Silsby is a missionary caught in international politics. The photos of kids at that pizza place all seem completely innocent. The language in the emails makes way more sense if they&#39;re in reference to drugs than if in reference to anything sexual. The only thing that seems like there&#39;s smoke involves the logos, and that&#39;s an incredibly specious thing to make a case on.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I do definitely see your point. There are some articles that pop up here that aren&#39;t even conspiracies... Just oorah donald trump stuff. And I agree this is not the place, unless he was crushing conspiracies and locking people up, or something.</p>

<p>But I still disagree with your assertion that they are &quot;doing the same thing&quot;. I have yet to see solid proof that TD is full of shills. TD is in your face, but it is up front and honest about what they are doing. They shit post in the name of the donald. </p>

<p>CTR hides, their M.O. is subversion. Their subreddit is called &quot;Politics&quot;. This is intentional, it&#39;s to give the idea that this is what &quot;Regular Joes&quot; are talking about. </p>

<p>There is a lot of solid documented tax/superpac proof that CTR subverts online and has massive resources. There might be people who are stupid as hell who just post random Trump circlejerk stuff here, but I have seen no proof that it is a massive subversion effort. If you can show me good solid proof there is, I will gladly concede.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I mean it was kind of vague to begin with, I disagreed with you saying &quot;they do the same thing&quot; in the first place so it&#39;s a little ambiguous from the start. </p>

<p>Idk, do you view brigading as an organized effort? When you say &quot;they do the same thing&quot; there&#39;s just too much not stated I have to disagree. I think it&#39;s just important to remember that pretty much every single person has an opinion on it one way or another, so of course it&#39;s going to seem like there&#39;s a lot of support for both candidates that is organic.</p>

<p>Equating ctr and their subversion with  trump support is just wrong from what I&#39;ve seen. The underhanded nature of it has really put a bad taste in my mouth if you can&#39;t tell. haha</p>

It&#39;s fun to TYPE IN ALL CAPS, and call people cucks, but in the end we&#39;re all aware of the reality of the situation, and are ready to hold him accountable to his actions. There&#39;s two types of conspiracy theorists, those with hope, and those who have lost all of it. Those with hope, see promise in Trump. Those who haven&#39;t, don&#39;t.
