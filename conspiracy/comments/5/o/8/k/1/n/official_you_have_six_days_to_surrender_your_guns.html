<p>Obama is coming to take our guns. I am a proud gun owner and Obama will take it only after I empty my chamber.</p>

<p>Or, just maybe, it was all bullshit. If there is a danger looming, it is Donald Trump. He is stoking the fires of war with China and the Middle East. He is stoking a trade war with Canada (CANADA!?), Mexico, China, The EU and anyone else he can name.</p>

<p>Trump has all sorts of Russian influence penciled across his orange ass.</p>

<p>This is our new reality. And our guns are safe. For now.</p>

<p>Keep them loaded and ready. If we need them, it will be because of Trump.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Again, you just regurgitated my entire point.</p>

<p>This is the SECOND AMENDMENT. No one can change it on a whim. This is WHY we have the NRA and other groups. To inform those people who do not take an active interest in this right.</p>

<p>I happen to read every damn thing I can about gun rights. Some people do not have time for that, which is fine.</p>

<p>But NO ONE can sneak this up on us. It will be very well publicized and we will always stop and efforts to infringe on this right. It is a given. We need to stay alert, as always of course.</p>

<p>But this issue is being used t divert is from thinking about other, equally important, issues.</p>

<p>We can handle many issues at once and the past eight years of concerns about gun rights have left other issues to be decided by mere politicians rather than the people. They use the gun rights issue to divert our attention.</p>

<p>It is time to stop that.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think the growing fear now -whether rational or not- isn&#39;t so much about changing the laws, but about one incidence that triggers a domino effect resulting in mass confiscations. Like martial law being enacted for one of various reasons, and the military are ordered to go door to door.</p>

<p>But I agree with you. There&#39;s virtually no chance of legislation making its way through the motions until it ultimately gets signed by the president on live TV and liberals joyously splash and play in the flowing rivers of conservative tears. It simply couldn&#39;t make it that far without being crushed. Many gun owners pay the NRA to keep their eyes on the whole situation at all times.</p>

<p>In addition to that, I personally don&#39;t believe that too many American soldiers would follow those orders on the ground. But you know who <em>might</em> be a little more likely/willing? The biggest, toughest, drunkest guys in the whole hemisphere. Trump&#39;s burly North Asian friends.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Others have mistaken my point, which is unfortunate.</p>

<p>I think you got it.</p>

<p>Guns are here to stay. And they should be. I have my guns to protect my family in the event of a home invasion or car jacking. I do not imagine I could fight the US Military with my firearms. If it came to it, and I thought the Constitution was being threatened, I would have to give that some serious thought.</p>

<p>But as it stands now, under Obama and under the coming Trump admin, that seems silly. My guns are for personal protection of my house and family.</p>

<p>Any legislative attempts to control the Second Amendment, we will fight and will win.</p>

<p>This is not a question. It is an answer.</p>

You act like they won&#39;t strip us of that right just how we&#39;ve been stripped of our other rights. They have been &#39;trying&#39; to take our guns for awhile, but they aren&#39;t really trying, they&#39;re just conditioning the people so that one day, they will give up their own right to bear arms.

    <div class="md"><p>Disagree.</p>

<p>I think the Obama &#39;takes your guns&#39; thing was a setup from the beginning.</p>

<p>It was meant to last across presidents, so that we would get used to the idea. It may not even be Trump. I don&#39;t see Donald like that, though I think he is dangerous. Just not to us. Dangerous to other countries and only to us as a side effect.</p>

<p>The 2nd amendment is strong, it will take a concerted effort across multiple presidents to weaken it. And only then if we aren&#39;t paying attention.</p>

<p>This is why we need the NRA. To keep us awake.</p>

<p>The president in 2025 or 2030 might be able to make a real effort to do this, but not now. And Donald isn&#39;t the guy to try. He has a lot of other shit goign on and this aint that important to him.</p>
