<p>With Trump going direct to the public he keeps them playing defense. Since it&#39;s a medium they aren&#39;t as effective at using this is probably pissing a lot of folks off. </p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p><strong>Jeffrey Epstein was said to have run a sex ring, where young girls were trafficked for the pleasure of his “elite circle of friends.</strong> He served time and settled with 17 of his underaged victims.</p>

<p>Trump: &quot;    <strong>“I’ve known Jeff for fifteen years. Terrific guy. He’s a lot of fun to be with. It is even said that he likes beautiful women as much as I do, and many of them are on the younger side.</strong> No doubt about it — Jeffrey enjoys his social life.”</p>

<p>It started last month when Senator John McCain gave the FBI a dossier outlining contacts between the Trump campaign team and Russian intelligence services. The dossier included evidence that Russia had “slam dunk” material, including video of Trump proving him to be a pedophile.</p>

<p><strong>Trump is currently in a legal challenge over a rape charge involving a 13 year old (at the time), charging both Trump and Jeffrey Epstein with a “double team” sex assault</strong>. Trump’s legal team alleges that the court gag order on the case and a proposed settlement which involves a potential “non-disclosure” can be used to prohibit grand jury testimony.</p>

<p>This may well be why it is so important for Trump to get a Supreme Court nominee passed, should this decision come before that body. <strong>However, there is no confirmation that this case is the one the Russians have video on, or that there is only one case</strong></p>

<p>“I expressed my profound dismay at the leaks that have been appearing in the press, and we both agreed that they are extremely corrosive and damaging to our national security,” Clapper said in a statement.</p>

<p>“I emphasized that this document is not a U.S. Intelligence Community product and that I do no believe the leaks came from within the IC,” he said.</p>

The men who were drafted to Vietnam became slaves of the Government to be used as cannon fodder. That&#39;s just a fact. It was not an honorable war, it was not a necessary war, and it was a completely inept war that the United States LOST. Waste of time, money, and American lives.</p>

<p>OJ&#39;s civil suit that he was found innocent of? Not the best example there bud. </p>

<p>The law suits were fake filings. How on Earth would the person who made those filings think that Trump had anything to do with Russia? Those fake filings were done years ago. The &quot;Muh Russia&quot; narrative on Trump has only come out very recently. </p>

<p>In other words, we don&#39;t fucking know if it is true or not.</p>

<p>You&#39;ve been caught lying.</p>

<p>Clapper did not debunk it merely said &quot;we didn&#39;t make it&quot; and &quot;we didn&#39;t leak it&quot; and &quot;it&#39;s corrosive to society&quot;. Did not give a yay or nay whether it is true or not.</p>

<p>Trump said it was phony. But then a pedo being blackmailed would say that.</p>

<p>Guilty. It was in his criminal lawsuit he was found innocent. If you can&#39;t understand that you won&#39;t understand Trumps legal maneuvers to keep his rape case buried.</p>

Translation: It&#39;s a big ol&#39; nothing burger full of lies and deceit. Innocent until proven guilty remember? If Trump is found guilty of illegal activities, or even has charges brought upon him, then I will concede the point. Right now it&#39;s just a bunch of sensationalized horse manure that the corporate media in this country has been dying to report on for months now. It&#39;s clickbait nonsense for page views, nothing more. Possibly an attempted coup on Donald Trump by the intelligence agencies. The CIA controls the media in this country afterall.</p>

<p>So you really believe that Trump managed to track down the bedroom of Obama in Moscow, managed to sneak into the bedroom with hookers, managed to have them piss on the Obama bed, and managed to get away with it too, if it weren&#39;t for those pesky Russians. Give me a fucking break cuck. I know you can&#39;t be that retarded.</p>

<p>James Comey ade a press conference where he listed all of the illegal bullshit that Hillary 100% did. It&#39;s not a question anymore. Hillary <strong>illegally</strong> sent and received top secret classified info at the time. James Comey &quot;let her off with no intent&quot; which is bullshit because Comey accused her of gross negligence or &quot;extreme carelessness&quot; if you&#39;ll recall.

<p>Trump wasn&#39;t funded big money by Sheldon Adelson, you&#39;re right! Trump won with self-funding and small donations. Some big money went to the RNC itself but that was not connected to Trump, and it was nowhere near the amount of money Crooked was taking in. </p>

<p>Trump got a least 25 million from mob boss Sheldon Adelson.</p>

<p>Giuliani is a Neocon and a NWO puppet, he helped the 911 false flag attack. Without criminals like him, the plot would have been exposed. Interestingly, Trump knew that bombs were involved and said as much, until he retracted and said the usual mumbo jumbo about jet fuel melting steel. Was Trump an insider who knew how the false flag was carried out?</p>

<p>The entire post, not just the title, is a shitpost. The only reason it made it to the front page is because of the Trump wave.</p>

<p>This sub used to be much more serious and would never have brought a post like this to the front page. You should know this.</p>

<p>Exactly. Fuck Trump, but fuck the CIA even harder. Trump hasn&#39;t done shit compared to what the CIA has. His scam &quot;university&quot;, his business discriminating against Black people in the 70s, allegedly raping that 13 year old child, even the wacky stories about him being a Russian plant. Nothing he&#39;s done, nothing he&#39;s promised to do, nothing he&#39;s alleged to have done is anywhere near as bad as the evil that the CIA has brought the world. </p>

<p>Anti-establishment in the sense that he has the CIA&#39;s panties in a bunch.  </p>

<p>There is a Cabal in control and the only part of the Cabal that is a US government agency is the CIA.  </p>

<p>I would be more concerned if Trump got along with the CIA.  No doubt Hillary would have.  </p>

<p>Of course, you are right, but some are more establishment than others.  If we want to regain control of our government, then we need to weaken the CIA.  I prefer to dismantle it.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I thought about your response a bit more.  When you say &quot;billionaires&quot; consider this.  The real establishment is the trillionaires.  The ones you do not see on the lists of the world&#39;s richest people.  </p>

<p>$1 Trillion is 1000 times more than $1 billion.  It is like me have $1 million and you having $1000.  If I have $1 million and you have $1000, then I can easily wipe you out.  If you have $1000, then you can easily wipe someone out with $1.  </p>

<p>The billionaires that you mention are super rich to you and me, but they are only foot soldier, like pawns, to the trillionaires.  </p>

<p>The war we are waging is against the trillionaires.  </p>

<p>I am reading more about Hitler to see if he understand what he was up against.  I think he did not.  The people he rounded up and exterminated were not a threat to anyone.  He targeted the wrong people.  If Hitler would have targeted the banker class, then his place in history might be much different.  It is interesting to consider...  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh, I do not worship Hitler.  Sorry if I gave you that impression.  One of my Grandfathers fought in Europe and the other fought in the Pacific.  I think the one that fought in Europe was in the Battle of the Bulge, but I am still trying to sort it out.  </p>

<p>Hitler and the Nazis got what they deserved, because they committed war crimes and crimes against humanity.  I have read about the Nuremberg trials.  I wish Hitler would have been hung along with the others.  </p>

<p>What I am saying is that Hitler made many mistakes, and history would view him much different if he understood the way the world really works.  </p>

<p>You know that American bankers funded the rise of Hitler, right?  One of the bankers was George Herbert Walker.  Does that name sound familiar?  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re trying to convince a socialist that bankers are evil. By bringing up Hitler. I don&#39;t need to know what Hitler should have done (putting the bullet in his brain 25 years earlier is the only thing he &quot;should&quot; have done.) to know that bankers are evil.</p>

<p>The way to fight a banker is not to elect anyone from the 1%</p>

<p>Yes, I know, HRC was beholden to the very same bankers I am railing against. As a socialist, <strong>nobody</strong> ever running for office for one of the 2 parties will even come close to my economic ideals. That leaves me with social issues to make my decision.

<p>It was a REALLY easy decision for me on which candidate to support. Trump&#39;s actions and words since winning have done nothing to convince me that I was wrong. Quite the opposite, actually.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I kind of lost track of this conversation because I have had several today.  </p>

<p>I think I was not clear on my Hitler reference.  I brought it up because I am going back and relearning that part of history based on what I have learned the past year.  History looks much different to me now.  </p>

<p>You are probably aware that Helene Hanfstaengl stopped Hitler from killing himself after his failed Beer Hall Putsch in November 1923. </p>

<p>Anyways, I support Bernie, so I have Socialist leanings to the point that people label me as such.  Of course, Hitler was a fascist, and the 1%, as you call them are also fascists.  My hope is that the US will become more Socialist in the future, and I am pushing towards that.  </p>

<p>&quot;Yes, I know, HRC was beholden to the very same bankers I am railing against.&quot; --  Yes, I am also against them.  My point before is that Hitler would have been smarter to kill the bankers rather than exterminate Jews.  Of course, it is risky to say anything remotely positive about Hitler.  </p>

<p>&quot;As a socialist, nobody ever running for office for one of the 2 parties will even come close to my economic ideals.&quot; --  Bernie is closer, right?  I think he should start a Progressive party.  My hope is that both the Democrats and Republicans will be done for in the coming years.  The Democrats are hurting, and the Republicans have a President that they did not support.  </p>

<p>&quot;I like having insurance, I like abortion being legal, and I like the lgbt community having rights.&quot;  --  I am with you.  I am straight, but I have a lot of friends and business acquaintances in the LGBT community.  </p>

<p>&quot;It was a REALLY easy decision for me on which candidate to support. Trump&#39;s actions and words since winning have done nothing to convince me that I was wrong. Quite the opposite, actually.&quot; --  I look at it this way.  With Hillary as President, very little would have changed.  With Trump as President, he will either, by some miracle, do well, or he will bring down the system by shear incompetence.  He is already in conflict with the CIA, so that is a good sign to me.  I am betting Trump will bring down the system by shear incompetence.  </p>

<p>When you mention the 1% being elected, this is where I see things differently.  I think that the 1% do not run for office because they would have to give up power to do that.  </p>

<p>As I mentioned before, the 1% are the trillionaires, the Rothschilds and their ilk.  They control the billionaires and the politicians and have them do the dirty work.  These billionaires being selected by Trump are merely pawns.  If they are removed from their positions, it will not change anything.  If someone like Rothschild, Rockefeller, Soros, etc. are &quot;removed&quot;, then that will change things.  One way to remove them is to nationalize the Federal Reserve.  Another way to remove them is to take power away from the CIA.  I honestly think that we should confiscate their money because they stole it from the U.S. taxpayers, and have been doing so for over 100 years now.  </p>

<p>When the people in the Trump administration start implementing their racist, sexist, homophobic policies, I know that people will protest and push back.  I am counting on it.  The idiots in the Trump administration will not be able to see that they are undermining themselves.  </p>

<p>The DNC was not able to see that they undermined themselves with their treatment of Bernie and his supporters.  Those idiots are blaming the Russians for their election loss!  They still have no idea.  This is the mentality of the people in the Democratic and Republican parties.  </p>

<p>So, let them screw themselves, then we can jump in and take over.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, I see it differently.  To me, Hillary is more establishment than Trump.  Hillary is bought and paid for, and established Republicans turned their backs on Trump and voted for Hillary.  I recall hearing such talk when Trump started winning in the primaries, and I found it interesting.  These Republicans, who I despise, are for Hillary and against Trump.  That means I should be for Trump if those are my two choices.  Of course, I wanted Bernie...  </p>

<p>I just posted that there is a Cabal in control, which includes the Rockefellers, Rothschilds, Soros, etc.  What most people do not know is that the CIA is the only part of the Cabal that is a US government agency.  Trump is already in conflict with the CIA, which is a good sign to me.  No doubt, Hillary would have gotten along fine with the CIA, which is another reason I am against her.  </p>

<p>Does this make sense?  We need to weaken or dismantle the CIA to break the grip of the Cabal.  We also need to nationalize the Federal Reserve.  </p>

<p>You&#39;re right, it simply has thedonald constantly here upvoting anything involving Trump.  And those doing so provide nothing and are only pushing their own agenda of supporting Trump and ignoring anything negative about him.  By downvoting anything negative about him since we have a lot of conspiracies to work with.</p>

<p>So the main problem is, yes the sub is pro-Trump.  It&#39;s fucking annoying.</p>

<p>Where are the conspiracies about Trump considering god damn news stations are even talking about this shit?</p>

<p>Oh downvoted because thedonald sub downvoted it.  There&#39;s my fucking conspiracy.  It&#39;s pathetic you lie when the evidence is literally right in this sub.</p>

<p>People need to grow a pair and start voting on conspiracy shit more here.  You&#39;re lying basically and it&#39;s obvious.  Great Trump did something, now where&#39;s also my many threads about everything NEGATIVE Trump does and the possibilities behind his actions that have been hinted at for a year?</p>

It seems like <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a> is where you have to go to explore anything anti-trump, which is annoying because the comment section is just an echo chamber that eliminates any chance for possible discussion.</p>

<p>Another thing that I noticed is that anti-trump conspiracies are hard to find on youtube too, unless it is from the MSM. If you look on youtube for videos countering the MSM there are hundreds of accounts with their own videos analyzing and refuting claims, but if you look for videos of trumps ties to Russia or anything anti-trump there are not nearly as much content. It is almost as if youtube is becoming the new talk radio for the right wing.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>From a conspiracy perspective there is a valid (if small) hope that he will change things. He has many issues as a person and president and likely isn&#39;t the savior people hope he is, but it is valid to point out instances where he shows potential to take down some of the corruption and members of shadow government even if that is being brought up by a shill or fanboy and even if it could just be him bullshitting us. </p>

<p>It is up to us to hold and share our own opinions. I&#39;ve seen that the vast majority of these trump posters are open to admitting that he may not be what they were hoping for despite still posting relevant bits about how he is challenging the CIA etc. I don&#39;t see what is wrong with that. The proper course of action against that is to explain why you are skeptical or think they are wrong to believe, not try to smear the sub as a safe haven for trump supporters when it isn&#39;t.</p>

<p>I&#39;m a lefty, and I disagree. I don&#39;t get nocturnal emissions over CIA lies. </p>

<p>And even so, who would dream about that shit? It was so obviously fake that even while Buzzfeed was doing as they were told and parroting the CIA&#39;s bullshit, they felt the need to point out that it was obviously bullshit. What a fucking horrible fake, it&#39;s as if they didn&#39;t even care about their lie even looking believable. </p>

I&#39;m all for mucking up the order of things, but is Trump really the guy we want doing it? That&#39;s discounting the idea that he is an elected official. If elections were corrupt and the rules of the game so clearly defined by the higher powers, why is Trump an exception to this &quot;rule&quot;? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This has been ringing through my brain. We got good old pizzagate in the weeks before the election, Comey&#39;s letter, this grand crescendo of doubt...and nobody thought to leak this thing then...because our intelligence agencies were actually looking into it, or in Comey&#39;s case sitting on it. Nobody revisited the mother jones article where the idea of an investigative dossier was first mentioned. All the attention was on Clinton, and all of it was bad. Trump and a Russian official &quot;warning&quot; about WW3 and Trump&#39;s apocalyptic final TV ad. </p>

<p>Bringing this thing out now, if it&#39;s a total fabrication, could be used to create doubt in Trump in the public eye, but literally achieves nothing in and of itself. He will still be inaugurated no matter what, despite his half-assed attempt to divest, swirling in controversy.  </p>

<p>There just happens to be a lot of controversy around our incoming President.  That&#39;s all related to r/conspiracy, no matter what side of the political spectrum you are on.</p>

<p>Yes, it is possible Trump is doing something bad but that&#39;s another conspiracy theory. My point is this thread is still related to another conspiracy that is frankly more viable. The CIA being used for political purposes by the Whitehouse is not a new event.</p>

<p>Kinda is. Usually it works the other way around, and if the Whitehouse doesn&#39;t like it, they get a send off from the grassy knoll.</p>

<p>No. One theory is that the source is 4chan. The left has quickly changed the narrative and given credence to the MI6 agent theory.
But in regards to that:</p>

<p>In fact, you would think that if <em>Buzzfeed</em> knew all this time they would have released it before the election. The same goes for the whole leftist media. They are hardly people who hold back against Trump.</p>

<p>Mother of Jones did an article in October. Looks like the British spook leaked it to the wrong source (they were too shitscared to publish the dossier ).</p>

<p>The FBI, which had been sitting on the info, released a letter and confiscated Weiner&#39;s laptop to distract anyone.</p>

<p>Why Hillary didn&#39;t use it? According to the Mother Jones article the Russians have blackmail material on her as well. Also, she was convinced she would win anyway.</p>

<p>This doesn&#39;t make sense. Hillary was publicly attacking Russia for months and talking about &#39;economic and military&#39; responses to Russia for (allegedly) hacking the DNC. If they had blackmail info on her she and Obuma wouldn&#39;t be pushing the anti-Russia rhetoric. They were throwing everything could at Trump, hiring trolls, starting violence, hiding and faking news etc. It is inexplicable that the tabloid Buzzfeed had this all this time and kept it a secret despite their bubbling clits for Trump. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Again, Hillary was publicly attacking Russia and helped create the current narrative about them. If Russia had dirt on her then she wouldn&#39;t be doing that. So it doesn&#39;t make sense that Russia was preventing Hillary and her &#39;media&#39; from releasing the dirt on Trump. You gave it a good try but it&#39;s implausible that the media would back on Trump. Heck, even when Buzzfeed did release it was because they just couldn&#39;t hold it in despite their inability to verify.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The fake news stations are reporting Russia has ties to Trump, Wikileaks has been compromised by Russia, and the recent document leak with golden showers and shit.  <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> has had heavily upvoted threads saying that <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/5ncovs/no_trump_is_not_a_russian_puppet_no_russia_didnt/?sort=top">the former two are flat out wrong and there is no conspiracy there.</a></p>

<p>So if Obama wants a conspiracy to die he just orders CNN to report it and the CIA to go along with it and therefore the conspiracy will go away and will no longer be discussed here.</p>

They weren&#39;t intending to harm Trump by leaking that bullshit? Come on.

    <div class="md"><p>Not to get too conspiracy meta, but this looks like a false flag attack on the subreddit.</p>

<p>OP&#39;s account is 3 days old. Looks like they made it 1 day after the moderators controversially removed <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/undelete/comments/5nby2o/16168713729_reports_allege_trump_has_deep_ties_to/">the Trump conspiracy post.</a></p>

<p>Since then MAGA_1991, an obviously fake username, <a href="http://archive.is/14Toz">has only shitposted</a> in <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>.</p>

<p>The title is clickbait and there is hardly any text in the self post. Obvious attempt to make the subreddit look pro-Trump is obvious.</p>

<p>There has been a large push on this subreddit, <a href="/r/OutOfTheLoop">/r/OutOfTheLoop</a> [<a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/OutOfTheLoop/comments/5nr97r/what_happened_to_rconspiracy/">https://np.reddit.com/r/OutOfTheLoop/comments/5nr97r/what_happened_to_rconspiracy/</a>], <a href="/r/SubredditDrama">/r/SubredditDrama</a> [<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/SubredditDrama/comments/5nmchd/is_rconspiracy_altright_safe_space_version2_a/">https://www.reddit.com/r/SubredditDrama/comments/5nmchd/is_rconspiracy_altright_safe_space_version2_a/</a>] and others to paint this subreddit as &quot;taken over by The_Donald&quot;. </p>

<p>This OP is a perfect example of the lengths people will go to try and make that false narrative a reality.</p>

<p>Yes there might be a large number of Trump supporters here, and yes the removal of [that Trump post 4 days ago](the Trump conspiracy post.](<a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/undelete/comments/5nby2o/16168713729_reports_allege_trump_has_deep_ties_to/">https://np.reddit.com/r/undelete/comments/5nby2o/16168713729_reports_allege_trump_has_deep_ties_to/</a>) was wrong, but Trump supporters haven&#39;t come close to taking over this subreddit and they are just as welcome here as any other supporter as long as they remain skeptical of every politician including Trump.</p>

<p>Hopefully the MODs will remain politically neutral so we won&#39;t have more weak attempts to subvert the subreddit, like MAGA_1991, in the future.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s a tip. Anytime someone says something like &quot;this is r/the_donald2&quot; or &quot;I liked this sub better before Trump fans took it over&quot;, they&#39;re 100% FOR SURE trolling. They might be a paid shill, they might be a useful idiot, they might just be a fucking asshole, but if they&#39;re saying things like that, they are 100% fore sure not posting in good faith. Don&#39;t let the karma score fool you either, trolls use sockpuppets to upvote each other, especially when we&#39;re talking about the paid astroturf. </p>

<p>But the CIA is still filled with liars and they&#39;re using the media to spread lies about the president. Trump is a fucking piece of shit and I don&#39;t like that he&#39;s my president. But you know what I like even less? Propaganda. Lies. The fucking CIA. Our new president is so fucking terrible that you can call him an alleged child rapist and be 100% correct. We don&#39;t need to make up lies or spread the CIA&#39;s lies in order to talk shit against him. We don&#39;t need to tell lies to make him look bad, he consistently makes himelf look bad. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This comment section is a goddamned swamp.  I tried to jump in and ctr about accusations about &quot;this sub&quot; becoming &quot;the donald&quot;.  What a load of horseshit.  Any attempt to characterize <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> has totally failed, as this is one of the most diverse subs I&#39;ve seen.  Where social democrats, libertarians, ancaps and paleoconservatives can all get along.  I&quot;m grossed out by the obvious narrative pushing and counternarrative pushing to create this swamp of controversy that DOESN&quot;T ACTUALLY EXIST</p>

<p>That said, ERE is what the OP should have posted</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not to get too conspiracy meta, but this looks like a false flag attack on the subreddit.</p>

<p>OP&#39;s account is 3 days old. Looks like they made it 1 day after the moderators controversially removed <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/undelete/comments/5nby2o/16168713729_reports_allege_trump_has_deep_ties_to/">the Trump conspiracy post.</a></p>

<p>Since then MAGA_1991, an obviously fake username, <a href="http://archive.is/14Toz">has only shitposted</a> in <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>.</p>

<p>The title is clickbait and there is hardly any text in the self post. Obvious attempt to make the subreddit look pro-Trump is obvious.</p>

<p>There has been a large push on this subreddit, <a href="/r/OutOfTheLoop">/r/OutOfTheLoop</a> [<a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/OutOfTheLoop/comments/5nr97r/what_happened_to_rconspiracy/">https://np.reddit.com/r/OutOfTheLoop/comments/5nr97r/what_happened_to_rconspiracy/</a>], <a href="/r/SubredditDrama">/r/SubredditDrama</a> [<a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/SubredditDrama/comments/5nmchd/is_rconspiracy_altright_safe_space_version2_a/">https://np.reddit.com/r/SubredditDrama/comments/5nmchd/is_rconspiracy_altright_safe_space_version2_a/</a>] and others to paint this subreddit as &quot;taken over by The_Donald&quot;. </p>

<p>This OP is a perfect example of the lengths people will go to try and make that false narrative a reality.</p>

<p>Yes there might be a large number of Trump supporters here, and yes the removal of <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/undelete/comments/5nby2o/16168713729_reports_allege_trump_has_deep_ties_to/">that Trump post 4 days ago</a> was wrong, but Trump supporters haven&#39;t come close to taking over this subreddit and they are just as welcome here as any other supporter as long as they remain skeptical of every politician including Trump.</p>

<p>Hopefully the MODs will remain politically neutral so we won&#39;t have more weak attempts to subvert the subreddit, like MAGA_1991, in the future.</p>

The CIA can easily outstrip me in investigative gusto. They simply chose not to. </p>

<p>My level of incredulity is at where Milton Cooper is talking about how CNN was able to interview UBL weeks before 9/11, but the CIA couldn’t seem to track him.</p>

<p>4chan and websites like it are known far and wide as places that mega corporations and world powers use to sway and manipulate public opinion. It was true back in November. It was true in 2011. It is true now. </p>

<p>Here’s something else to think about, too: Donald Trump has been implicated in very real cases involving sexual deviancy. Now this very real connection has no credibility because of this whole fiasco. </p>

<p>Like, there&#39;s no playbook for any of this, and all they can do is have the MSM continue to throw feces at him while he continues doing the Trump thing. The people that run this country and pretend to know what they&#39;re doing are finally going up against a beast they can&#39;t kill, getting hosed at their own game, and everyone&#39;s watching.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re trying to convince a socialist that bankers are evil. By bringing up Hitler. I don&#39;t need to know what Hitler should have done (putting the bullet in his brain 25 years earlier is the only thing he &quot;should&quot; have done.) to know that bankers are evil.</p>

<p>The way to fight a banker is not to elect anyone from the 1%</p>

<p>Yes, I know, HRC was beholden to the very same bankers I am railing against. As a socialist, <strong>nobody</strong> ever running for office for one of the 2 parties will even come close to my economic ideals. That leaves me with social issues to make my decision. I like having insurance, I like abortion being legal, and I like the lgbt community having rights.</p>

<p>It was a REALLY easy decision for me on which candidate to support. Trump&#39;s actions and words since winning have done nothing to convince me that I was wrong. Quite the opposite, actually.</p>
