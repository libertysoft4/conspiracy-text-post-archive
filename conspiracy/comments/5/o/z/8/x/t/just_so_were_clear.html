History is a lie and everyone in the higher class of every country has been coerced, recruited, or killed.</p>

<p>The news is fake and there to scare you.</p>

<p>Human beings are infinitely more powerful than we are told. Your attitude and behavior towards other life forms is what shapes our perception of reality.</p>

<p>Keep fighting and learning the truth. It is painful, yet rewarding; difficult, yet fair; and harsh, yet kind.</p>

<p>The truth will come out in our lifetime, the question is if we will accept or reject it.</p>

<p>Edit 1: post got a lot more chatter than expected. If anyone wants to conversate privately or has interesting information about Ancient Mystery Religions, feel free to PM me.</p>

<p>Edit 2: from the bottom of my heart I would like to thank everyone who participated in this discourse; r/conspiracy is truly a bastion of freedom, and though our community is relatively small, each one of us can make a huge impact. Each of you has impacted me. I hope I have done the same for you. I wish the best for all of you. You are our last, greatest hope.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Doubt is a powerful deception tactic. Wether the earth is round or not I don&#39;t know. In my experience, most flat earth theories merely place doubt around the round earth rather than prove it&#39;s flat. There are even some good real world examples that prove the earth is round and what direction the earth is spinning such as the coriolis effect. If you have stumbled upon any thing that I could read about the flat earth that are convincing I would be forever grateful. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I do want to address one thing, which is that I just got done with my studies of Human Sacrifice, and, essentially, I would have to say, Human Sacrifice is within the divinity.</p>

<p>In the Old World, Human Sacrifice continued until 1000 AD, typically at a rate of ~1,000 or so person a year. In the New World, it was infinite, with the Mexican religions sacrificing the most frequent, say 50,000 a year up till 1500 AD ish.</p>

<p>Then comes war, in which the one who eats grain, prospered, and the ones that ate flesh (natives) killed and ate the flesh of their enemies, in periods of famine, and later as custom.</p>

<p>But it&#39;s the nature and causes of human sacrifice that I find most intriguing. Sacrifice, as was most practiced in Mexico, represented the differing between the societies of man and the societies of the divine. Which is to say, as the Mexicans realized the chasms so great, that that felt it was but little right not to sacrifice, near all of man.</p>

<p>And within the Hindu culture, the sacrifice of ones life was but enlightened suicide. To realize the bodily form has no meaning, and to voluntarily take ones life. In such a way, the mass sacrificial nature of Mexico and the individualistic practices of India were same. A service to divinity, not say of punishment, but of relief from punishment.</p>

<p>And then I think of christian culture. Which is to say, with Jesus sacrifice was to &#39;stop&#39;, as he paid for our sins. However, that is wrong. So wrong, as it absolves ourselves from the actions of society.</p>

<p>And that is the great danger of christian teaching, the weakness it creates, the immorality it perpetuates. The separation from life and duty, society and punishment, others and self. A christian can witness the killing of others with a clean conscious, where as the Hindu will kill themselves first, as Gandhi teaches.</p>

<p>In such a way, human sacrifice is the most noble, moral of religions. Society is to birth and rebirth until an apex, but once born, one becomes fixed, like a tool. Fixed within a primitive system.</p>

<p>Sadly, however, as OP has stated, the Old Primates of man, the ones in which the hereditary wealth has been passed done for centuries, millennia, have not changed, or kept up with Man. Confined within their ancient beliefs, mixed with the absolution of guilt that came with Christian teaching, the rulers have perverted the means up which they sacrifice, until now, where it has no meaning.</p>

<p>The Rulers of Man, in their beliefs, sacrifice in a way akin to the ancient sailors that would cast off a soul in order to change the wind. For they understood not the meanings of the world around them. And likewise, as we are unable to grow without progress, we too shall sacrifice, mostly others, but occassionally ourselves, through bombs, blood sport, discontinuity, and prisons.</p>

<p>Until at last, the mass of man learns to sacrifice themselves for the good of the whole. And the collective error is internalized, for always.</p>

<p>Lastly, to expedite this process, to reduce the failings of man, we must cycle, birth and rebirth. And no where are our failings more prevalent than in the nature of hereditary wealth.</p>

<p>When the money, the units that influence society, when some 50% of these units reside within the lives of so few, it creates a chasm, insurmountable. For they understand Human Sacrifice, but as the way of the most primitive. A prayer to an alien god. They sacrifice children, not themselves. They eat from the flesh of the punished.</p>

<p>And that will be the difference. When society is individually, and collectively prepared to pay for such crimes as war, and attrition, then the end will be near. None will settle for the accepted state of things, that so few will dictate so many. That the progress of man shall be locked into an archaic past.</p>

<p>That is to say, we shall sacrifice ourselves, for the good of all, and sacrifice those in control in proportion to their monstrosity. Collectively and individually, we will participate in the outcome, for all will accept the burden, and through such a way, the societies of man as we know them. Will end.</p>

<p>We will be as we were intended to be. An evolving species.</p>

<p>The Mayans predicted the world would end in 2012? Holy fucking hell were they close. The evolution of our species is likely less spiritual, and more calculable, than we&#39;d be prone to suspect.</p>

<p>And so will be our history. One of primates ascending to heaven.</p>

<p>I carry a gun everywhere I go, in case I need to stop an evil man from killing. And this is virtue in Christianity:</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s a bit of a dark look at it. </p>

<p>Maybe your right but I think it&#39;s much more likely given the evidence I&#39;ve seen that time and history are cyclical,and that we are <em>always approaching</em> another golden age and another Kali Yuga; or dark age. </p>

<p>All that exists is the &quot;now&quot;, the present moment. If we become spiritually responsible than happiness, awareness, and integrity become second nature; isn&#39;t that the goal? </p>

<p>...the more I see, the more I think the Hindu creation myth is the most accurate. </p>

<p>Unfortunately for your premise, that means that these cycles of history are gigantic; interglacial millenia at least. The pithy saying I took from the subcontinent is, <em>&quot;The world is many things: it is neither Good nor Bad.&quot;</em></p>

<p>Worrying about the ultimate fate of our species takes our minds away from the Now, the only time we can affect our condition. </p>

<p>I respect that you made this topic, but I cannot agree with your conclusions. The future of Truth you claim inevitable can only be found with great effort, but I would not be so bold to claim that we are on such a trajectory while the possibility of the cults you mention fully consolidating their position to the detriment of the rest of us. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I fully understand your position, and your not wrong. </p>

<p>I personally believe we are in the Dwapara Yuga or the &quot;Grey Age&quot;. Basically it&#39;s the time when there is still some good in people, before we inevitably reach a point of absolute degradation in society. </p>

<p>That being said, we may be entering the Kali Yuga very soon, which would really not be a fun experience, as all morals and goodness erode from man for an age. </p>

<p>But you have to take the long view.</p>

<p>Everything will be okay, and the sun will rise again. I personally love human life and all of its wonders and I was born very, very poor and into a strict religious household. </p>

<p>The door is open for the brave hearts to shine </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thank you!</p>

<p>As far as your question, it&#39;s the great mystery. But I do believe everything you said is correct one way or the other. I think the universe <em>adapts</em> the same way we do, on a much larger scale. </p>

<p>Perhaps a being(s) who created Earth or the physical universe originally intended something much different and, like a clock maker, wound up time and let it loose upon itself. Maybe someone (something) altered the &quot;machine&quot;; changed its &quot;programs&quot;. </p>

<p>Perhaps everything is derived from an original distortion or accident, and we are truly the only creative soul; in a universe such as this we are just infants; with aeons of discovery waiting for us beyond the atmosphere.</p>

<p>Perhaps every single cell and every single moment in life; every single sound and song, and experience and thought all come from a cosmic library somewhere in space. </p>

<p>Perhaps the mind itself creates these stories. </p>

<p>If you keep digging into yourself you see that there is a gentle, child like appreciation for the complexity and beauty of the universe, and wa la</p>

<p>You&#39;ve arrived. 
There is no more fear of anger, only bliss. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I tend to lean toward the pursuit of knowledge collectively creating the universe through the underlying human consciousness. With quantum physics, they say that a particle exists in multiple states until it is observed. What if through observation of things, both tiny and across large distances, we collectively shape our universe?</p>

<p>We discovered cells, which gave way to atoms, followed by quarks. After telescopes we found other planets and galaxies. I mean, what if Earth really was flat until someone decided to check, and then it became round when it was observed to be that way? Crazy I know lol 
On the other hand, I believe if you keep zooming in on &#39;empty space&#39; you eventually get to the Planck length, which supposedly looks pixellated, so maybe we are in a simulation of our universe, who knows?
As far as religion, I don&#39;t have one, but I do believe in an overarching &#39;cosmic energy&#39; permeating all existence. Maybe all matter is is manifestations of that energy.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Everything you just said resonates with me and I at least believe is possible, of not outright fact. It really is a wonderful mystery. </p>

<p>I think our destiny is to map our this cosmic terrain and become higher beings of intense pragmatism and benevolence. </p>

<p>If you believe there exists cycles as I do, it&#39;s possible we&#39;re the only intelligent beings <em>left</em> in the universe. </p>

<p>All the ones we&#39;ve been in contact with may be ghosts. </p>

<p>Maybe the universe will be ours&#39; for the taking; and we can create a new civilization in our image; just like &quot;god&quot; did before us. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sorry to butt in, I believe this to be true. When you think about it, the only true thing that can be gained or taken away from life is knowledge. Sort of like when you play a video game... you can build things, buy things, earn money/credits and build things but once it is turned off, all that is left is the knowledge of your experience with it that improves your next experience with it.</p>

<p>Every existence has experiences to learn from, some greater than others, but none the less there to learn from. Whether you choose to follow the &quot;story quests&quot; and advance or just &quot;mess around&quot; and not advance, is entirely up to you, but each life has certain meanings to learn from.</p>

<p>Before someone says, &quot;What about a stillborn baby, what could you learn there?&quot;, well, if you look from a mother or fathers perspective, the doctors, nurses, relatives, etc., every different perspective is affected by what in a macroscopic view can seem irrelevant or miniscule.</p>

<p>But, yeah, in a nutshell, I do believe the goal is to learn how to peacefully interact with other perspectives and ideals.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>&#39;What&#39;s the meaning of life&#39;? Hardest question in the world ain&#39;t it heh. That&#39;s what set me off years ago, still haven&#39;t found the absolute answer, but the more ya delve, the more ya learn, no doubt about that. </p>

<p>After years of reading, fooling myself, learning, guessing and hoping, I&#39;ve ended up with a bunch of answers that I didn&#39;t even know there was a question for if that makes sense? </p>

<p>I remember first starting out years back (maybe twenty), I was determined to find &#39;answers&#39; to the &#39;mysteries&#39; I&#39;d convinced myself existed from the past and also to discover wtf I was even supposed to be doing on this planet. </p>

<p>What happened for me was, I couldn&#39;t stop &#39;going back in time&#39; it was always a case of &#39;this is interesting but what did people think/do before that,&#39;. So from reading about &#39;Mysterious Wales in the 1600s&#39;, I ended up in Ancient Sumeria learning about their mysteries and religion. Not quite sure where I&#39;m going with this now I&#39;ve been papping for ages! Think I was gonna say, start with what interests you and see where you end up, you&#39;ll be amazed at the answers you&#39;ll find! </p>

<p>Must admit after years of delving, I&#39;m kinda on the right path (I think) of discovering my/a &#39;purpose&#39;. Haven&#39;t a clue what to do next but I&#39;m gonna carry on searching, even if I&#39;m just kidding myself, I&#39;ve learnt so much along the way, I can only be a better person as a result surely? Hope so anyway heh.</p>

If they are aware of the Bible and the rapture, they obviously know it&#39;s going to happen, but they rather just say no, its worth having those few years on earth to finish our agenda, then spend eternity paying for it.
I just don&#39;t get it.
But we are the end times for sure. We might get another 3.5 years, or several more years, but I don&#39;t think it&#39;s much longer than that and I DO NOT WANT to be here if I&#39;m &quot;left behind&quot; the world is going to be hell. 
Globalists getting to be public with what they do behind closed doors and inflicting it on everyone? As well as chipping people, imagine ISIS controlling every country. Islam is Satans key, it pops up during history trying for world domination, and gets crushed back down, but no, it will rise and it will be they key for all of this. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>i agree that the world is run by death cults.</p>

<p>christianity is a death cult itself, one of the most cynical, right up there with buddism?</p>

<p>the whole premise is to put your faith in an invisible messiah who will reward you with eternal happiness...the catch being you have to die first.</p>

<p>the reason death cults rule the world is because they were one of the only effective means of suppressing upprisings from the underclass, because (a) they acknowledged life is suffering (which it invariably is for the slave and underclasses), (b) it offerred a jack and the beanstick bargain to those with no bargaining power--5 beans for decades of labor, to take you to heaven upon deatn, and (c) it provided an outlet for the rage and dispair people felt caused by their unjust, inequitable treatment by promising that their persecutors would get what&#39;s coming to them when they died...and of course no one could come back and expose the fraud, because, well, they were dead.</p>

<p>the heroic religions that the death cult religions replaced, all said, &quot;death sucks, being dead sucks, the place you go when you die sucks, so enjoy life&quot;--with one exception, the only way to motivate people to risk their lives in battle when they believed being alive is infintely preferable to being dead, was to create eternal blisses for soldiers--valhalla and the elysian fields for example. </p>

<p>peoples who never developed rigid, oppressive class systems and/or were not belicose, retained animistic shamanism, being one with the world. where everything in existence is one and all time is now.</p>

<p>the one exception, the only unique religion, which is simultaneously not a religion, is confuscianism. though confuscianism&#39;s stricture on knowing and accepting one&#39;s place in society, functions like a death cult, without the bribery.</p>

<p>as more and more people become a-religious, they become harder to manage. the &quot;don&#39;t worry, it gets good once you&#39;re dead&quot; doesn&#39;t sell anymore. the &quot;accept one&#39;s place in society&quot; doesn&#39;t have traction in a democratic worldview. dying for glory died at verdun.</p>

<p>the oligarch have always been the leaders of the death cults, but the reaction of the public is no longer awe and fear, it is meh and ewww and wtf.</p>

<p>we are on the verge of returning to the eternal now, those who feel oneness with all else is growing. i think we will not achieve your goal until we embrace oneness.  </p>

In the Bible it says that after this current age ends there&#39;s 1000 years of life under the kingship of Jesus, then after that there&#39;s a second permanent death of all those opposed to life under those conditions. Then after that the entirety of the will of the creator will be complete and humans will live forever in a glorified state once again like the conditions of the garden of eden.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>Religions have been taken captive, this is true; but the kernel of truth within them is invulnerable,</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Within Christianity, it&#39;s the Bible. The church has taught all kinds of horrible, twisted distortions of what it says (sex is evil, God hates fags, etc.) </p>

<p>But if you sit down and read the text freshly, and are willing to put in the work to interpret it properly (historical context, understanding literary genre, etc.) it is remarkably different from the caricature most people reject.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s sort of a metaphor. </p>

<p>The truth I&#39;m speaking of is the knowledge of human dignity; our true history as a species, our unparalleled innovation and determination; our ability to love so purely as to envelop all other dispositions. We are creators not creations. </p>

<p>Basically, we have been lied to; many people realize this, albeit at varying degrees of understanding. </p>

<p>What I&#39;m saying is that someday we will reach that boiling point when enough people are mad and curious about enough stuff, that we tip the balance in or favor.</p>

<p>Now, on a spiritual, individual level (the most important and sacred level) this has already been achieved by many of our ancestors and constituents. </p>

<p>On a macro-level we are the first generation in known history to have access to the power of Truth. </p>

<p>I&#39;m not hinting at anything. It&#39;s all around you. Breathe in the delicate, tense air. War is coming; a war between good and evil, between the soul and the mind. </p>

<p>Now do you see what I mean? The truth is out. It&#39;s the ability to see, perceive, and <em>accept</em> truth that we are lacking. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I love this post, thank you!</p>

<p>For anybody looking for a little backup info, this video is the very, very tip of the biggest conspiratorial iceberg humanity has ever seen. <a href="https://www.gaia.com/video/message-humankind">https://www.gaia.com/video/message-humankind</a></p>

<p>I watched this and scoffed at the person who showed it to me. But then I got curious. I started watching more. Yes, theres a subscription fee. But, the first month for a Gaia subscription is 99 cents and I watched the whole series in that time.</p>

<p>The evidence just piles up. I was not much of a  conspiracy theorist before I watched these. I knew the US orchestrated 9/11, but I didn&#39;t think the mass shootings were false flags. I knew extraterrestrials existed, but didn&#39;t think they were here. I knew the politicians were corrupt, but I didn&#39;t know they were literally satan worshipping baby eaters. I went from Berniebro to Alex Jones in less than a week.</p>

<p>That said, I also had a serious hunger for the spiritual mysteries, and Cosmic Disclosure actually led me to the most incredible resource I&#39;ve ever read: thelawofone.info , a summary derived from The Law of One books.</p>

<p>These things pieced together so well, I voraciously devoured the material. I&#39;m still working through it all. One thing is certain, it&#39;s changed my life. Take a look for yourself. With an open mind, there&#39;s no limit to the truth you can discover.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Keep reading my friend, every source you named with exception of Alex Jones has <em>something</em> to offer you. </p>

<p>I would listen to Alan Watts, Terence McKenna, Manly P. Hall, Aleister Crowley (most mysterious man of the 20th century, be careful; could be a trap but great context material), Graham Hancock, David Icke (with a grain of salt), and there&#39;s like them.</p>

<p>Also go back and read Zechariah Sitchin and the early sci-fi work in the 50&#39;s and 60&#39;s. </p>

<p>More truth than fiction in some those books. </p>

<p>God bless </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, you have to realize that human brains are made to pay attention to 2 things in particular:</p>

<ul>
<li>Danger</li>
<li>Sex</li>
</ul>

<p>You&#39;ll have a hard time to ignore those 2 signals, in whatever for, they come in. Your brain will pay attention to it. The television and telemarketing people are very aware of this and purposefully using it to their advantage. There&#39;s a good reason some publicity on the radio will start with car horns so that your brain will pay attention to their publicity. Likewise, the television folks like to remind us of imminent dangers to keep us glued to their channel, to get more profit.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah I&#39;ve been having a difficult time lately feeling like everything is artificial, and finally knowing what &quot;living in a simulation&quot; ACTUALLY is. I&#39;ve always read into different theories since I was 11..and I don&#39;t know, it finally just crushed me this past week. It&#39;s making it really difficult and hard to wonder why they say -people could rise against the government - but WHY DONT WE? WHY DO WE LET PEOPLE WHO WORSHIP A SATAN CULT THAT PUT SYMBOLS UP AND RITUALS AND BUILD SHIT IN SHAPE FOR IT, LIKE WHY DO WE LET THEM DO THIS? WHY DOES IT HAVE TO BE THEIR WAY? WHY DO THEY LIVE ON A DIFFERENT REALM, CREATE A FAKE REALITY FOR US, THEN JUST DO THE WEIRDEST FUCKING SHIT THAT THEY LITERALLY PUT EVERYWHERE? 
WHY DO WE PUT UP WITH IT?
WHY DON&#39;T WE SEPARATE OURSELVES FROM THEM? WHAT IF THERE WAS A COUPE AND WE NO LONGER LIVED UNDER PEOPLE WHO WORSHIP SATANIC BEINGS AND DO THE MOST FUCKED UP SHIT.
D.C. SCARES ME THE WAY EVERYTHING IS SET UP AND WHY THEY SET IT UP THAT WAY, DENVER AIRPORT MAKES ME REALIZE ITS ALL ARTIFICIAL.
I&#39;m sorry I&#39;m just really trying the past week to find a way to compose all these thoughts.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The Order of the Quest, The Brotherhood, Illuminati, whatever you want to call these people...have engineered out ENTIRE reality. It really is mind boggling when you scratch your neurons together. Is it really just a group of people in a secret society(ies) controling the world for the past however many thousands of years? </p>

<p>One day did 5000 years ago some friends come together and say, &quot;Hey you know we have a lot of knowledge about the world, our bloodlines can take it over eventually and hoard all the information about the universe and our reality, what do you guys say?&quot;</p>

<p>Have we actually been controlled by reptilians from the lower 4th dimension? (Seriously, why do so many people discredit this? You don&#39;t even know what a fucking black hole is, how do you know there aren&#39;t being in other dimensions controlling us? I totally get people shitting on this theory, but fuck it really is annoying that people don&#39;t try to give ANY thought towards more &quot;crazy&quot; theories...they are engineered this way though!)</p>

<p>Are the Greys controlling us? Other aliens? Is it Anunnaki from Nibiru who genetically created Humans to be their slave race such as Zacheria Sitchen claims? Or are we just in a simulation, and the elites figured this out? Are we vastly powerful spiritual beings expiring a life in the third dimension, have always been and always will be? Or do we just zonk out into blackness and the non-existent when we die? Why would the elites give a fuck to do all of this? So they can live their measly 90 years on Earth kind of ruling it from behind the veil? So their kids can rule it? Honestly, it makes me think there is more to life, after death, and all that because of everything they are doing. Do they really value their offspring that much to try to make them the rulers of the world? I mean 100 years ago the elites didn&#39;t totally rule the planet, and today they don&#39;t. They don&#39;t have their one world government, one religion yet. So why do it, for their kids some day, or their kids kids? Or do they know something, do they know they&#39;ll be around after this life? </p>

<p>Are the royal bloodlines ruling us made up of the same DNA that we are, they just figured out how to rule the planet long ago and have been working on it ever since? When was that, Roman times? </p>

<p>What kind of knowledge are they hoarding? Do these satanic rituals really work? Is it simply just tradition, or is there real purpose? If there is real purpose, that means there is some kind of force the general public does not know about. Is it spiritual, magic, who the fuck knows but it sure isn&#39;t in our realm of knowledge if there really is something about it. </p>

<p>What is their end goal...everyone says its to kill off 99% of the worlds population right? Is that after they use us to build their infrastructure, or what? We know they are soft-killing us, AIDS, cancer, vaccines, wars, H1N1, etc..idk. Too many thoughts for this evening!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t know, I know all kinds of stuff about the disappearance of the American cultures. I know this because I&#39;ve read about half of 1491, a book by an American. There are Muslim scholars studying Jesus. Historians, in general, study events, and generally they are very far removed from the situation, certainly if more than 100 years have passed since, and they&#39;re often neither the victor nor the loser, who may both be long dead, and the end result is that history may not, in fact, be written by the victor in most cases.</p>

<p>History is written by Historians.</p>

<p>They will, but historians will not necessarily take their word for it. Certainly not after everyone involved is dead.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Let&#39;s just say there were no good guys in WWI or WWII.</p>

<p>There certainly were bad guys in WW2. Holy shit, they were literally Hitler.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Reading half a book doesn&#39;t make us an expert. I also don&#39;t really understand your argument. Your correct that historians are usually far removed from the periods they write about, but that doesn&#39;t have anything to do with the actual control of knowledge. </p>

<p>If tomorrow Trump and all the other word leaders decided Christianity isn&#39;t okay anymore and is punishable by death, hen bibles would burned, entire groups of people would cease to exist, and the memory of Jesus would be irreversibly forgotten over the course of a few decades; when a new generation grows up without hearing about him. </p>

<p>Do you see? </p>

<p>Entire religions and philosophies have disappeared from the face of this planet because of the winners of wars and conflicts. All we have left is whispers. </p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>I wasn&#39;t saying I&#39;m an expert on ancient American civilizations, I was saying that a book about them exists. Written by someone who is neither victor nor loser, analyzing history in an impartial way.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>that doesn&#39;t have anything to do with the actual control of knowledge.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The victor usually doesn&#39;t destroy all information about the loser. Virtually every war we know about had a losing side, and if someone who is uninvolved knows anything about the war, they know about the losing side, and if they&#39;re not actively controlled by the victor I don&#39;t see why their perception of the losing side wouldn&#39;t be impartial.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>bibles would burned, entire groups of people would cease to exist, </p>
</blockquote>

<p>As happened many a time before. We know about these conflicts, both sides of them, one was the victor but we see both sides as primitive tribal cultures, because history was written by modern historians.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>and the memory of Jesus would be irreversibly forgotten over the course of a few decades</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I doubt that very much.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Entire religions and philosophies have disappeared from the face of this planet because of the winners of wars and conflicts. All we have left is whispers.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The prominent culture would be prominent. And that would be part of history, when it&#39;s written a hundred years later, by impartial historians.</p>

<p>That being said, we may be entering the Kali Yuga very soon, which would really not be a fun experience, as all morals and goodness erode from man for an age. </p>
