<p>The only &quot;power&quot; needed to discredit #pizzagate is basic critical thinking and a resilience to extrapolated nonsense. There are many real conspiracies that deserve analysis - the gullibility of people who believe this particular heap of sick, projected bullshit is embarrassing. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is why this sub is a laughing-stock. It used to be a place where people actually engaged in an exchange of interesting ideas, now it&#39;s just a right-leaning fake news circle jerk.</p>

<p>I&#39;m a &quot;shill&quot; because I read a lot, follow politics, and don&#39;t swallow every absurd hit-piece that comes from the delusional far-right? And replying to me will just &quot;lower the intelligence&quot; of <a href="/u/Delusional_Liberal">/u/Delusional_Liberal</a> - a user who just threw a temper tantrum and called me a &quot;brainwashed faggot&quot;? Yeah, we wouldn&#39;t want to lower <em>his</em> intelligence - there can&#39;t be much left to spare.</p>

<p>I think some self-examination is in order here. Who do you want to be in this world? Are you here because you value the truth, or are you here to be a pawn in a right-wing fantasy? The real conspiracy is not pizzagate - it&#39;s the billionaires, industrialists, and Christian extremists who are gaining unchecked control of our government. This fake news shit is a distraction from an actual power grab, just like Trump&#39;s constant tweeting. They have been building this up for decades, and they are counting on the divisiveness and inaction of the public. Utterly mind-boggling how well it is working out. Nice job, America.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Let&#39;s just look at some noble quotes from <a href="/u/ApollosCrow">/u/ApollosCrow</a> - a user who tells us that he <em>just wanting to focus on the &quot;real conspiracies&quot;</em> and that this sub has been derailed. Well, aside from them being an avid and typical r/politics and r/enoughtrumpspam poster we can find, just from a few days of content, patterns in how this particular poster concern trolls:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You are so thoroughly entrenched in a conspiracy-laden internet fantasy...</p>

<p>You want a real conspiracy? Pay attention to the upcoming administration of billionaires, Christian fundamentalists, and fossil fuel cronies...</p>

<p>You are so thoroughly entrenched in a conspiracy-laden internet fantasy that you don&#39;t even notice your own capacity for critical thought shriveling up.</p>

<p>what you&#39;re demonstrating here is conspiracy-driven armchair criticism of a field you have actually no knowledge of, because &quot;the media&quot; is probably the most popular scarecrow of this moment</p>

<p>NPR ranks high on the scale of trust. It isn&#39;t just that they are &quot;not as bad&quot; as a conspiracy website or social media news, it&#39;s that they are a well-established</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No user of a board such as this would ever dare use the term conspiracy as a means of conducting an ad-hominem. We know that the term itself was originally weaponized to marginalize people who didn&#39;t buy the official JFK assassination story.</p>

<p>So you want us to believe that you simply want this sub to go back to &quot;the good stuff&quot;? <em>If only we could get passed our obsession with being T_D 2.0 and pizza we&#39;d get your seal of approval.</em> Your divide and conquer shit won&#39;t work here, sorry.</p>

<p>You may be comfortably surrounded here by Trumpster sycophants, but in truth your comments make you look ridiculous. Trump is not as much a threat to the free press, mainstream <em>or</em> independent, as he thinks he is. He is however a threat to reason, sustainability, and actual liberties - regardless of your personal ability to realize it. Worse, Trump is himself merely a tool for a longstanding far-Right agenda that has been angling for power since the 80s.

<p>If you frequent subs with political content and biases, you begin to notice that pro-Trump sentiment seems to shoot way up when it&#39;s late at night for the US, but morning for, oh I don&#39;t know, <em>Russia</em>. I see this over and over. Isn&#39;t that weird?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Think about this: </p>

<p>You rule this planet. Your slaves are easy, compliant. You almost fell empathy for them - sometimes. The great unwashed are hard to love consistently, after all. But now - they&#39;re starting to think, stating to question, starting to organize and rebell in ways you hadn&#39;t necessarily anticipated - at least not in your lifetime. You sit on the precipice of something entirely new. Do you fight them? Or do you simply reduce their numbers back down to a more manageable population? </p>

<p>It&#39;s a conundrum. </p>
