        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I have to give a shout out to vigilant citzen first and fremost. <a href="http://vigilantcitizen.com/">http://vigilantcitizen.com/</a>  The best comprehensive look at occult symbolism surrounding us through mass media. To get a great overall picture, read the &quot;Read this first&quot;, and then flick through 3 or 4 of the &quot;Symbols this month&quot; articles. You will see, if you haven&#39;t before... Anyway I have a question.</p>

<p>I was introduced to the site last night and read almost half of all of the articles. I haven&#39;t read their ebook yet, which may answer this.</p>

<p>But please, I ask anyone knowledgeable: Why? Why the illuminati symbolism throughout (every aspect of life) mass media? Why does every one of their media pawns go to the extent they do to put these occult symbols into our daily lives? Is it some sort of brand of ownership, in that they put these &quot;trademarks&quot; all over the shit that we consume so people &quot;in the know&quot; understand that they own us/ the media? I just am not sure WHY the occult symbolism is so prevalent throughout music/tv/movies.</p>

<p>I&#39;m sure I&#39;ll have follow up questions but I&#39;m in a hurry right now between classes but EXTREMELY CURIOUS!!!</p>

<p>Thanks bless you all </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree it&#39;s part of the deal, the ritual, I just want to completely understand why. And also I don&#39;t see it mocked or ridiculed very much at all...</p>

<p>It seems most of the &quot;LOL Illuminati&quot; bs that occasionally pops up in media is just to keep it as a sort of running joke.. But not to mock the group per say, more like making a little joke of the fact that &quot;no one  ( credible ) believes in this type of thing &quot;. So rather than the joke being aimed at them the joke is created by them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s kinda the point, the joke is made so that you are afraid to pay attention to what is going on or at least not talk about it out of fear of ridicule from your piers.

    <div class="md"><p>Agreed. Pretty amazing.. Everyone, kids, teens, adults know what illuminati is. Yet it might as well be nothing as far 99% of population are concerned. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Long story short, for the type of Magik that they participate in they use symbols or sigils to draw power into making the change that they want a reality. You give power to the sigils by displaying it in public and having the public conditioned to feel certain emotions by seeing that symbol (in this example). TBTB are then able to use the energy given to them by the masses, vis a vis these symbols in their magik rituals. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>For the &quot;little&quot; things, tiny signs everywhere the main reasons are (by decreased order of importance) mocking (us), bragging (among themselves), and casting &quot;spells&quot; (against viewers).</p>

<p>The big stuff, e.g. Superbowl/Grammies/Olympics/tunnel ceremonies are often giant &quot;masses&quot; celebrating their sinister cult: rituals, through which they believe they can harness the captivated attention of millions and somehow make use of it (see <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magick_%28Thelema%29">magick</a>). </p>

<p>Finally there is the hermetic belief that by imitating nature you exact more effectiveness from the universe, i.e. you have more power. (Look into Fulcanelli). So they align their deeds with dates, sprinkle them with symbols and numbers, in order to imitate/plant pseudo-synchronicities (that would naturally happen if the deed was truth-driven) to increase the effectiveness of their action. Again it is a form of magic, divination.</p>

<p>TLDR: These are highly superstitious people.</p>

<p>So basically for the same reason that aging stay at home moms subscribe to &quot;The Secret&quot;, they do what they do. </p>

<p>Like for example let&#39;s say they have some catalyst event that is likely to set into motion a desired event. Say 60% chance the desired event is triggered. </p>

<p>By channeling ancient symbols, ruins, beings and energies, the universe is naturally more aligned to create favorable circumstances for the catalyst. Now the desired event is 85% chance of being set into motion. </p>

<p>Am I knocking on the right door here? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Put yourself in their perspective: imagine you walk into a bustling toy store in New York City as a member of an immunization grouping that is in on all coding.  Look at all of the people around you looking plainly at all of these esoteric symbols and never knowing the better.  Imagine how that would make you feel....empowered.  Better.  Smarter.  Manipulative.</p>

<p>There is a tiny owl on every dollar bill in plain sight that not 1%of people know about.  Every bar code starts with a 6 bar line.  Has one in the center and one at the end.  It&#39;s everywhere around us and the point is for us to not notice.  </p>

<p>Yep never knew this stuff. Have been noticing roman and illuminati symbology non-stop though. I wonder if different groups are competing as well. Like a bunch of dogs pissing on fire hydrants trying to claim territory.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know that I see it as terribly complex.... But then again I do not know what I do not know.</p>

<p>I know they have imposed this cancer on our culture for decades. I know it drastically reduces our power in several ways. (Maybe you can add more) We are more often victim to our immediate desires, increasing predictability, lowering actual satisfaction. It keeps us dumb perpetuates weak genetics. Now that I think of it, I wonder if it&#39;s not <strong>mostly</strong> a long term plot to preserve elite bloodlines but also to perpetuate among the proletariat genes that are not favorable.</p>

<p>Feel free to add anything. very curious. Thank you </p>

    <div class="md"><p>What I meant by complexity, I meant that every topic of discussion that is shrouded in mystery has threads holding it in place from other mysteries.  They all connect and when you learn enough about different things the larger picture emerges and it suggests that we&#39;ve been the victim of cover up after connected coverup.  </p>

<p>The good thing is that this ultimately reveals their ultimate fear of us finding out.  </p>

<p>I suggest skipping around the George Webb YouTube Braverman videos because he makes sense of almost all of the absolute worst conspiracies we&#39;ve been peddling the last 30-50 years.  He ties everything together using main stream articles and facts that paint a much larger picture of how all of these atrocities interplay for the benefit of the elite.</p>

<p>Even if all turns out to be false, the style of his thinking is where we should be heading.  We&#39;ve fragmented our information into different subjects for so long that most people fail to make connections.  With our database on the Internet of history and knowledge it&#39;s all there jut waiting to be constructed into truth.  There is a ton of disinformation but there is always some truth in it and it takes strong intuition and logic to weed out the crap.  </p>

<p>It is much easier to bury the truth in lies than to try to take it away.  </p>

<p>All of this together creates the symptom of the victimized human constantly in a state of needing more to be happy.  </p>

<p>That is our choice, not their command.  We need to choose to be happy and trust our intuition that something very evil has been lurking for ages.  </p>

<p>I&#39;ve been meaning to watch more. Love the ones I&#39;ve seen. Do you recommend any over the others? Or any other quality information you recommend that may shed light on some of what I&#39;ve discussed in this thread? </p>
