        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Ever since the start of this most recent European terror wave, I&#39;ve been convinced that there was some element of the European far right that&#39;s been responsible for most of these attacks that have been attributed to ISIS and refugees. These are Cold War-style Gladio stay-behind operations, only this time NATO&#39;s boogyeman is Islam instead of communism. Its main purpose is to suppress dissent, violate civil liberties, keep control over their tax cattle, and also to use the wave of ISIS-based terrorism as a weapon against Russia, China, and Assad. </p>

<p>Another purpose served by NATO&#39;s Islamic State regional proxies is that Russian troops are much less likely to push into western Ukraine or into an EU member state if they know that they will have ISIS to deal with should they ever attempt an assault on wider Europe. This is likely the politicians&#39; main political justification for the creation of ISIS in the first place. </p>

<p>Here are some notes on Gladio:</p>

<p>Here is an alleged eyewitness account to the Paris shootings who describes three white guys in a black car as responsible:</p>

<p>As someone who has been following this peculiar phenomenon very closely for a very long time, one of my worst concerns that I have ahead of the fifteen year 9/11 anniversary is that world elites, their far right mercenaries, and a cabal of neo-fascistic political opportunists in the West, Russia, and the Middle East will use another right wing terror attack to further scapegoat Arabs and Muslims. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Since 9/11 is a Sunday, I&#39;ve been guessing (not predicting, just taking a wild horrible stab in the dark), a mass organized attack on churches by &quot;evildoers&quot; with semi-automatics, wiping out a ton of Christians. </p>

<p>This would set off a shit-storm of dominoes, from gun control to surveillance state to removing forces of goodness, etc., etc. </p>

<p>BUT....I also think that there&#39;s a lot of super secret forces pushing back against the evil plotting. I&#39;m pretty convinced there was more to that SpaceX rocket blowing up than we&#39;ve been told, and that it&#39;s payload wasn&#39;t what we were told, either. </p>

<p>Israel firsters who came up with the project for a new american century are now aligning themselves with hillary clinton. So basically nothing is going to change, there will be only escalation of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V-vEGNEtKSU">(watch)war.</a></p>

<p>Whats even more frightening is that Europe is being dragged into this. The refugee crisis essentially aligned Israeli&#39;s foreign policy with European foreign policy.</p>

<p>Another possibility is one of those democracy-bringing Invasions that they are experimenting on Libya or Ukraine in the last few years, this time on Hong Kong. I already made at least one post concerning this and it can happen very easily with Soros agents and political unions running legislations.</p>
