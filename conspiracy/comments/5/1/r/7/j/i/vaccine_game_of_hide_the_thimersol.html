        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I posted this in a response on the big feed and it&#39;s a wasted effort I am sure that will just get me roasted but I thought it might be an interesting discussion here.</p>

<p>Does anyone else see how the FDA and vaccine makers are hiding thimersol they &quot;took out&quot; of childhood vax and put instead into recommended flu shots so it ends up equal to pre-thimersol cleanse of the others?  I try to keep up to date with the vax issues but this one clicked today.  I mean I knew about it bring in flu vaccines but not the accumulative amounts being equal.</p>

<p>It&#39;s ironic they shifted the thimersol out a new door.  Truth is stramger than fiction as they say.  Remember Batman when Jack Nickelson&#39;s Joker rerouted his toxic waste to a new area and people were afraid to use products.  They should be... this has been true of beauty products, soaps and deodorats, make up and hair products for decades. People don&#39;t read the labels and it&#39;s not really a fiction at all just not so obvious.  I know I was so careful with my diet for years no MSG or corn syrup etc but it didnt occur to me to check ingredients of stuff I used on my body or even OTC drugs like Nyquil... until my HFCS reaction of puking and horrifically painful gut cramps after I took a couple doses.</p>

<p>Anyway back to the vaccines.  Sure they stopped the thimersol in end formula of most childhood vax but its not gone.</p>

<p>And they use those original vax in 3rd world countries because poor Africans or Asians etc deserve some extra mercury?</p>

<p>Some food for thought below.  My Post: </p>

<p>Read a label some time. The adjuvants are rather horrifying and it&#39;s not just mercury and aluminum.  Aluminum has strong implications in Alzheimers and other disorders btw.</p>

<p><a href="http://vaccines.procon.org/view.resource.php?resourceID=005206">http://vaccines.procon.org/view.resource.php?resourceID=005206</a></p>

<p>Sure they say trace amounts of thimersol or aluminum or aspartame, msg, formaldehyde etc but when you realize a newborn will be facing 49 doses of 14 types before age 6. The accumulated heavy metals is staggering and well past EPA recommended maximums.  Japan in contrast 12 doses of 6 vaccines. </p>

<p><a href="http://www.nvic.org/Doctors-Corner/JulianWhitakerMD/The-Truth-About-Vaccinations.aspx">http://www.nvic.org/Doctors-Corner/JulianWhitakerMD/The-Truth-About-Vaccinations.aspx</a></p>

<p>Compare also our infant mortality rate to theirs (SIDS being of &quot;unknown cause&quot; yet US has one of highest infant mortality rates - under 5 yrs old) with US ranking 6th worst in the world right below Turkey, Mexico, Chile and Slovakia while Japan is near the bottom at 29</p>

<p><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_infant_mortality_rate">https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_infant_mortality_rate</a></p>

<p>Something isn&#39;t right here.  And thanks to our newest failed Healthcare &quot;reform&quot; that just pandered to insurance and pharmaceutical companies I hope the world can begin to see a pattern.</p>

<p>The FDA is corrupt and protecting the biggest in the business because the people running it leave to very lucrative employment at these companies afterwards.  No laws against this conflict of interest.</p>

<p>They finally made some moves to &quot;reduce&quot; thimersol but they just replaced it with aluminum and put the thimersol into flu vaccines which if you follow the &quot;guidelines&quot; with 25 mcg shot while pregnant (unbelievable for what is rarely a dangerous common ailment even when pregnant) and yearly doses of children containing 12.5 mcg x 6 doses we are back at the pre-2000 thimersol levels.  It&#39;s a shell game hiding it from us.  All this while telling us not to eat fish when pregnant because of mercury contamination.</p>

<p>It&#39;s an all or nothing gamble here in the US and thanks to MSM most of yall will just roast me alive instead of stopping a moment, with an open mind and reading that pros and cons website.  MSM wants their advertisers happy and the pharmaceutical companies are some of the biggest.  In fact just about every &quot;news&quot; organization is owned by some umbrella corp that also owns a big pharma company.</p>

<p>And besides that they also own our government.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;The combined profits for the ten drug companies in the Fortune 500 ($35.9 billion) were more than the profits for all the other 490 businesses put together ($33.7 billion) [in 2002]. Over the past two decades the pharmaceutical industry has moved very far from its original high purpose of discovering and producing useful new drugs. Now primarily a marketing machine to sell drugs of dubious benefit, this industry uses its wealth and power to co-opt every institution that might stand in its way, including the US Congress, the FDA, academic medical centers, and the medical profession itself.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah they did a bait and switch. They took it out of routine pediatric vaccines, then immediately added the flu shot to the schedule, which contains 25 micro grams per dose. Other vaccines are also allowed to claim they are preservative free, but can contain up to 1 micro gram. The general public think thiomersal is long gone, which is simply incorrect. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks for this post. I had no idea they moved thimersol to flu vaccines.</p>

<p>If you&#39;re wary of OTC drugs, I just wanted to give you a heads up to be careful with skin lotions, sunscreens in particular. Transdermal drug delivery is a thing. Your body absorbs stuff you rub on your skin. My rule of thumb is don&#39;t put anything on your body that you wouldn&#39;t eat.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Vaccines are there to induce highly profitable lifelong autoimmune diseases, which make you into a customer of pharma for life.  </p>

<p>They can&#39;t make money out of you when you&#39;re healthy.  So they come out with junk science, which is based mostly on assumption, that vaccines bring more benefit than harm, they avoid and refuse all real studies to assess the good against the bad.  Propaganda gets pumped out from the top of the industry down to those below, some believe it, some don&#39;t, all they all have to repeat it or they get ostracized by the industry.  </p>

<p>If vaccines were stopped there would be very few sick people, pharmaceutical profits would be decimated from current levels, that&#39;s why they are so pushed so hard.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s actually a fairly simple concept if you think about it.  Vaccines add adjuvants like aluminum because they invoke a massive antibody response from the human body.  When testing for vaccine effectiveness they usually just test for the amount of antibodies produced.  They really want to make sure that your body knows to reject the virus that is present.  The problem is that sometimes the body can&#39;t recognize the difference between the virus and the other stuff in the vaccine.  Vaccines routinely have ingredients such as soy oil, peanut oil, MSG, egg albumen, bovine fetal serum.  Concurrently we&#39;ve had an unprecedented explosion in serious allergies to peanuts, soy, and eggs.  A lot of autouimmune conditions are related.  Almost all children with serious autism also have severe gastrointestinal issues.  There&#39;ve been some studies on the GI tracts of autistic children, and they found hugely increased measles antibodies present.  It basically looks like these childrens&#39; bodies have been tricked into thinking they&#39;re battling measles.  The result is a huge amount of inflammation in the gut, which means that nutrients are no longer absorbed and sent to the brain during a critical time in a child&#39;s development.</p>

<p>Autoimmune conditions happen when a body begins attacking itself, vaccine developers have gone too far to increase antibody response to make their vaccine appear more effective.  The problem when you use aluminum/thimerosal to invoke an antibody response is sometimes the body goes haywire and starts attacking things you don&#39;t want it to.</p>

If human cell lines were used in the development of a vaccine, that vaccine may induce some people&#39;s bodies to start attacking similar cells in overactive immune response.</p>

<p>They were like spastic kids, couldn&#39;t walk without their legs being strapped into the irons and the big clunky ankle-supporting leather boots the irons hooked into at the heels. even in the leg irons, they were jerking like marionettes and falling over often.</p>

<p>Continue to think that, most old people will. You can&#39;t teach an old dog new tricks after all. </p>

<p>Or, leave your ego behind and conduct a thorough, rigorous inquiry into the matter. If you&#39;re willing to leave your illogical preconceptions behind you&#39;ll find the world looks very different than you one imagined.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You say you have solid evidence of the causes of your cousins disabilities but you are asking me to take your word for it because you haven&#39;t provided any evidence.</p>

<p>The vaccine courts started denying a large number of claims in around 2000 when they were suddenly deluged with people claiming that mercury in thiomersal caused autism.</p>

<p>They had to make their standards more stringent and reduce fast-tracking claims since there is absolutely NO evidence that vaccines cause autism.</p>

<p>Withered and paralysed limbs due to polio have been around for thousands of years, since at least Egyptian times. In countries where there is low rates or no vaccination there is still a high death rate from polio. Polio was eradicated in Australia and the USA due to widespread vaccination. All medicines have a failure rate, vaccines included. The rate of injury due to vaccines is still a small fraction of injuries due to the disease. The difference is, if you are injured due to a medicine or a vaccine, you can try to sue for compensation. If you are injured due to a disease, you cannot.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The majority of the scientific community that advocates for vaccines is either incompetent or has not done a thorough research and trusts the bought and paid for opinions of experts.</p>

<p>I think it&#39;s important to understand that the scientific community as it exists currently is a highly dogmatic organization. Research funding is paid for by either corporations, or government. Research that violates profitable dogma is either hidden, or researchers find themselves without funding.</p>

<p>I&#39;d advise disregarding claims that the subject is too complicated to understand, it&#39;s not. Another commenter has given you a good place to start a self study, but honestly just understanding the published research is enough to reveal that vaccines as they currently exist are a joke.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;d like to offer a slightly different perspective from someone who can read the science, and has read the package inserts. The additives are put into the vaccines because they would not work otherwise. Live viruses and whole (dead) viruses used to be used almost exclusively. But they found that a person will shed live viral cells for a long time after (if you read the package inserts, you will still find this warning in the MMR...viral cells shed for 14-28 days through mucus). So they started using fractions of the virus, but that made it much less effective. So now you have to add something to &quot;prime&quot; the immune system, so it recognizes that there is something to fight. Unfortunately, aluminum is common (this can be removed slowly from the brain with malic acid). I have read some papers on neuro-immunology, which said that this also primes the immune system in the brain to respond with brain swelling as a first response, and for an extended period (3-6 months after each vaccination). So if any other illness is contracted, brain swelling will likely occur. </p>

<p>Next problem....because of the previously mentioned viral shedding, anyone who has ever read their package inserts to their chemo drugs will read the warning to stay away from any individual who has recently received a live or dead virus vaccination (I was on 4 different chemo agents that said this on the insert). This means that, even though the dead virus vaccines don&#39;t carry the viral shedding warning, this does still occur. </p>

<p>Next problem....If you read the package insert to any vaccine, it says that patients with eczema or asthma should consult a doctor before being vaccinated, as adverse events are more likely to occur. That is because these people already have an immune disorder. This would suggest, to me at least, that any individual that already has an autoimmune disorder should also not be vaccinated. </p>

<p>Next problem...Herd immunity was only ever studied for natural immunity against measles. I have read the studies for the current argument for herd immunity that include man-made vaccines and they are flawed. Actually, there are some glaring flaws in their statistics and conclusions. These become apparent if you look specifically at mumps studies (since the vaccine only works for 10 years, and most adults are not given boosters of mumps). </p>

<p>Anyway, sorry for the length of my post. I really only hoped to provide more perspective on what is wrong with vaccines (apart from the money and marketing aspect).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thank you for this, very informative!  Herd immunity appears to be a near total farce.  You mentioned vaccine derived mumps immunity only lasting 10 years.  DTaP derived whooping cough immunity only lasts 5 years and wanes significantly each year.  Tetanus also lasts less than 10.  The vaccine derived immunity from most vaccines is short lived at best, yet we have hordes of uninformed people berating &quot;anti-vaccers&quot; over herd immunity, yet these people are likely no more protected than the people who didn&#39;t vaccinate.  That is, unless they&#39;ve been getting a multitude of boosters every 5 years.. and nobody does that.</p>

<p>correction: you would have <em>tried</em> to roast us alive...you would not have succeeded </p>

<p>Letting that go I am glad that you have started to think straight. The reason I am skeptical about vaccines is simply based on the populist view of vaccines (pro-vaccine or your literally hitler) lining up with the government and big-pharma view of vaccines (if you haven&#39;t had your shots you <em>are</em> hitler). Vaccines are a medicine and we all need to scrutiinize very carefully what we put into our bodies and the bodies of our children...and mass vaccination is no exception...in fact the very reason that it a <em>mass</em> big-pharma pushing scheme is because everyone has bought into the fear. Fear of not doing something and getting a rare disease versus taking something and having your chances of getting sick skyrocket because of side effects...known or unknown.</p>

Autism is an absolutely devastating lifelong condition that also puts a massive strain on the people who have to care for you.  1 in 50 children now.. but the rates are skyrocketing.

We&#39;ve seen the prevalence increase 400x.  People are still trying to say autism is genetic.. a 400x increase in prevalence of a genetic condition over a couple decades simply doesn&#39;t happen.</p>

<p>BUT, what IS understood is that vaccines do not cause autism.</p>

<p>Thanks to Wakefield, SO MUCH research has been done into finding connections between vaccines and autism that now, the only certainty we have with autism is that it is in no way connected to vaccines, except coincidentally because the age range at which the first symptoms of autism begin to appear is around the same time as many infant vaccinations are given.</p>

<p>guillain barre syndrome</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That is complete bullshit.</p>

<p>You are trying to mislead by making it sound like a vaccine is the only cause of GB.</p>

<p>In fact, influenza itself is one of the causes!</p>

<p>Your figures are totally wrong.</p>

<p>Guillain-Barré syndrome can affect anybody at any age, afflicting only about one person in 100,000, REGARDLESS of whether they were vaccinated.</p>

<p>Usually Guillain-Barré occurs a few days or weeks after the patient has had symptoms of a respiratory or gastrointestinal viral infection. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Two thirds of people with Guillain–Barré syndrome have experienced an infection before the onset of the condition. Most commonly these are episodes of gastroenteritis or a respiratory tract infection. In many cases, the exact nature of the infection can be confirmed. Approximately 30% of cases are provoked by Campylobacter jejuni bacteria, which cause diarrhea. A further 10% are attributable to cytomegalovirus (CMV, HHV-5). Despite this, only very few people with Campylobacter or CMV infections develop Guillain–Barré syndrome (0.25–0.65 per 1000 and 0.6–2.2 per 1000 episodes, respectively).[8] The strain of Campylobacter involved may determine the risk of GBS; different forms of the bacteria have different lipopolysaccharides on their surface, and some may induce illness (see below) while others will not.</p>

<p>Links between other infections and GBS are less certain. Two other herpesviruses (Epstein–Barr virus/HHV-4 and varicella zoster virus/HHV-3) and the bacterium Mycoplasma pneumoniae have been associated with GBS. The tropical viral infection dengue fever and Zika virus have also been associated with episodes of GBS. Previous hepatitis E virus infection has been found to be more common in people with Guillain–Barré syndrome.</p>

<p>Some cases may be triggered by the influenza virus and potentially influenza vaccine. </p>

<p>An increased incidence of Guillain–Barré syndrome followed influenza immunization that followed the 1976 swine flu outbreak (H1N1 A/NJ/76); 8.8 cases per million recipients developed the complication.</p>

<p>Since then, close monitoring of cases attributable to vaccination has demonstrated that influenza itself can induce GBS. </p>

<p>Small increases in incidence have been observed in subsequent vaccination campaigns, but not to the same extent. </p>

<p>The 2009 flu pandemic vaccine (against pandemic swine flu virus H1N1/PDM09) did not cause a significant increase in cases. </p>

<p>It is considered that the benefits of vaccination in preventing influenza outweigh the small risks of GBS after vaccination. </p>

<p>Even those who have previously experienced Guillain–Barré syndrome are considered safe to receive the vaccine in the future. </p>

<p>Other vaccines, such as those against poliomyelitis, tetanus or measles, have not been associated with a risk of GBS..&quot; <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guillain%E2%80%93Barr%C3%A9_syndrome">SOURCE</a></p>

<p>Occasionally surgery will trigger the syndrome.</p>

<p><strong>In 1976</strong> there was a small increased risk of GBS following vaccination with an influenza vaccine made to protect against a swine flu virus. The increased risk was approximately 1 additional case of GBS per 100,000 people who got the swine flu vaccine. </p>

The Pharmaceutical industry is preparing to take a massive hit to their profits and are looking for more revenue streams.  Vaccines have an insanely high profit margin because they are classified as a &quot;Public health measure&quot; instead of a drug, they don&#39;t have to go through nearly as rigorous a testing phase as prescription drugs.  In fact, no vaccines at all are even studied vs placebo.  And their revenue is essentially guaranteed because they&#39;re mostly bought by governments, not people.</p>

<p>You&#39;re going to see a massive string of overhyped viruses in the next couple decades.  Zika is the first.  It&#39;s a farce.</p>

<p>As someone else mentioned, scientists need funding too.  The problem is, corporations that need studies to obscure the dangers of their products pay a lot more than non-profits trying to uncover dangers.  &quot;Science&quot; is the new buzzword used to push corporate bullshit on us, just remember: scientists have absolutely no say in the running of these corporations.  They are run by greedy psychopaths who don&#39;t give a fuck about real science.  </p>

<p>Real science is still on your side.  Check google scholar, there are a multitude of studies done by real, independent scientists that expose the dangers of certain vaccines.  It&#39;s important to not treat this issue as black &amp; white.  A lot of vaccines have done a lot of good for this world, the problem is greedy psychopaths have taken over what was once a humanitarian endeavour because they saw the profit to be made.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thank you for asking, although it may be anticlimactic.  While I am a middle aged woman, I have been your typical checked-out American who was inspired by Bernie.  That has become an epic rabbit hole that has taken me from anarchist-capitalist reddits to conspiracy sites to prepper pages.  I&#39;m trying to take in everything and judge nothing, as I THOUGHT I was a rationalist.  Turns out, I was a product of my environment above all else.  So, a difficult time, but once one accepts election fraud as a fact, pretty much anything goes.</p>

<p>Do you want to be an influencer of ideas, or do you want people to ignore your stances due to your delivery?  You are actively subverting people who are genuinely open to discussion and debate with your insulting behavior.  It&#39;s clear from the link above that I stated to u/Scroon that I never abused anyone, just ignored the issue.  Yet you continue the kind of behavior that actively discourages those who are willing to learn from you from even listening to you.  It&#39;s unfortunate that a person who has the ability to expand an important message behaves in such a way as to prevent others (who are uniquely willing to listen, as that is a rare opportunity for activists) from hearing that message. </p>

<p>You&#39;re feeding a stereotype of activism that does harm to the message, by stridently fighting issues that don&#39;t exist.  u/Scroon said to me, &quot;Welcome, and congratulations on your journey,&quot; because he/she understood the unique opportunity to sway a convert to a new belief system.  Your comment actively discourages such conversion.  </p>

<p>TL;DR   If you want your message heard and considered, DBAD while delivering said message.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks for this post, it&#39;s a touchy subject for a reason. Having kids myself, there are certainly incentives for the vaccines, as in my state, kids need them to attend school. </p>

<p>One anacdote I can share is my 12 month old daughter had a bad cold at the time of her one year visit. Since her previous 3, 6, and 9 month vaccines had made her out of it and cranky for couple days, I asked to delay the administration of the vaccines until she was better from her cold. </p>

<p>You would have thought I asked them to do something horrible. They were very defensive about the request.  I asked the doctor if the efficacy of the vaccines was dependent on such a short period of time, like a week. I asked if it really mattered if we waited a week till she was better.  Ultimately, they admitted that there is more like a few months window and that we could reschedule to bring her in another time.  </p>

<p>I didn&#39;t reschedule, but just brought her in for her 18 month checkup. We had a different doctors and nurse who said it didn&#39;t matter that we skipped 12 month administration since there are so many, the efficacy periods overlap. </p>

<p>In short, I am really on the fence about this whole process and the different information that is presented by multiple health care providers.  And how easily they get frustrated with you for asking relevant questions. </p>

<p>This is because they don&#39;t have the answers. Remember, Doctors are people who memorized and regurgitated information for at least 18 years. They&#39;ve got a lot of ego, and debt, invested in being right, but usually have completely lost any ability to think critically. </p>

<p>They&#39;ve been told that vaccines are good, because of <em>x</em>, <em>y</em>, and <em>z</em>. But, they never took the time to look into the foundations of these beliefs because they were being bombarded with a huge amount of information that they had to memorize and regurgitate.</p>

<p>Even assuming that the fundamental suppositions behind vaccine effectiveness were true, giving them to a child before 12-18 months would be worthless because before then you don&#39;t possess the sort of antibody response system used to justify the administration of vaccines.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Vaccines are first developed without adjuvants in a buffer used to maintain the product. Through development I can tell you there is nothing malicious about the formulation. We test the product, if it demonstrates the characteristics that we need then we&#39;ll produce a new formulation with adjuvant. Aluminium Phosphate is perhaps the most common and adjuvants help stimulate an immune response. Our data proves greater titer levels of IgG production with the use of an adjuvant. If there is a conspiracy anywhere in this, it would be at CMO facilities. Edit for grammer.</p>
