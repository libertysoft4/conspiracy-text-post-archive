    <div class="md"><p>Yes there&#39;s an effort to derail, obfuscate, ambiguate legitimate ideas and groups.  All the time.  They&#39;ll copy tactics and try to look like the things they&#39;re trying to subvert.  Here&#39;s the thing - when you&#39;re not acting out of fear, and with genuine care for others, you&#39;re led to the truth anyway.   If you seek the truth, you&#39;ll thank the disinfoists for any smells (often legitimate!) they send your way.   They&#39;re doing legwork for you.

    <div class="md"><p>Occasionally you find gems, and that&#39;s the only reason I come here, to get my share of affirmation. I still am completely unable to do anything about the situation. There are times I tried being vocal, but nothing good ever came out of it. Hence I stopped and am so passive to what is going on lately, putting my energy in my career and future. Sometimes I couldn&#39;t give two shits and feel like humanity deserves the fate that is coming for us. I don&#39;t really know what else to do. I see so many good people here try to wake people up and inspire and motivate the community. I really admire those people that still put up a fight, but overall its been a downhill slope.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Here is something I been working on they have really been trying to bury. I think it hits too close to home.</p>

<p>It goes like this. </p>

<p>Humanity is used for parts, blood, testing or toys.</p>

<p>In the past we were straight up slaves. Our masters used free energy ( the pyramids of Giza, the pyramids of the grand canyon ). Eventually, the slaves rebelled or weren&#39;t usable for the purpose required due to stress.. ( animals in captivity have high stress levels and don&#39;t act natural ).</p>

<p>The pyramids in the grand canyon were destroyed and the history hidden for obvious purposes. It was then gutted and we were told it was water erosion ( it wasn&#39;t ).</p>

<p>So the next iteration of slavery we were given the illusion of free will and the illusion of choice.</p>

<p>This is why all presidents are decided for us.</p>

<p>We are contained in a controlled environment. This is why NASA lies about space. Think of a huge terrarium. </p>

<p>Whomever runs this joint is able to flood it and start over again.</p>

<p>Who knows how many times this process had to be restarted with changes made to keep the illusion of free will working nominally.</p>

<p>The idea of religion and free will was most likely started by our masters.</p>

<p>I have a feeling this iteration is about to come to an end because they are losing control.</p>

<p>I also think a certain bloodline of people  are gatekeepers of this place. Maybe they have direct contact/connections with the owners of this place off world.</p>

<p>I think the gatekeepers have a guide on how this whole thing plays out ( the bible end times  ). Even though it&#39;s not true, they have to follow this storyline. It&#39;s the blueprints they were given to start the next iteration of this human zoo we are in.</p>

<p>The Masons, the satanists and the jews are pawns for something bigger. They are the curtain hiding the wizard of Oz. </p>

<p>It&#39;s a bunch of fail-safes to not see who is really running the show.</p>

<p>The pyramids line up to start constellations for a reason. These pyramids are all over the earth. Our masters tell us they are just tombs and they hide the real history.</p>

<p>Who knows how many times resets were performed. Their goal is to have a natural habitat where the human doesn&#39;t suspect containment. </p>

<p>The truth is trickling out so I suspect a reset soon. </p>

<p>Many just think this is rich greedy people behind this. I think it&#39;s much bigger than that.</p>

<p>Spit balling here, I think that CERN is a working portal device. Probably to usher gatekeepers to other areas in the universe. Maybe to areas the pyramids point to in the sky. I think off world civilizations exist and gatekeepers are in the know.</p>

<p>The whole Cern sacrifice thing is just disinformation to make people think satanists are behind this. It&#39;s a show to hide what is really going on.</p>

<p>We live on a prison planet or plane or who the fuck knows. Some advanced space terrarium that serves the needs of another advanced civilization. For some reason I don&#39;t think we can comprehend how advanced that civilization is.</p>

<p>Any current tech we have now has been around for probably thousands of years and just trickled out to us to conform to a timeline that&#39;s predetermined.</p>

<p>For some reason our masters dont want us knowing that the star Sirius was important to our past. One of the reasons the Sphinx was defaced and the dog head was replaced with a human head. They also never make mention that the pyramids are aligned with a star system. All of them, the ones in Egypt and the ones on North America.</p>

<p>Some more info:</p>

<p><a href="https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=CgOa2eccPVk">https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=CgOa2eccPVk</a></p>

<p>This info is buried because it throws off the narrative that ancient Egyptians were a primitive people. They were highly advanced and harnessed free electricity.</p>

<p>Here is a scientist explaining how the pyramids could have been used as free energy devices:</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You can also view youtube footage of many others who have done so.  There is a problem with this, however.  The video is a long range visual observation and it must be interpreted in the context of the behavior of light within the atmosphere.  When our brain interprets images it makes the assumption of straight light. </p>

<p>But light does not travel in straight lines through the atmosphere, it bends upwards and we need to interpret images with this in mind.  Here is an experiment with surveying devices which demonstrates this behavior:  <a href="http://www.wildheretic.com/bendy-light-the-evidence/#Theodolites">http://www.wildheretic.com/bendy-light-the-evidence/#Theodolites</a></p>

For proof you can take photos yourself where mountains or large building are partially hidden due to the curvature on the earth. I will gladly read you proof though and offer counterpoints. I just don&#39;t see the point of faking something like the shape of the earth. What does it achieve? I get hiding things like ufo&#39;s which I&#39;ve seen but why would they lie about that? What is the purpose? If the earth was concave we could see things from a much greater distance.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh so basically you&#39;re saying I will always feel 0 acceleration no matter if i move across the earth which also has its own net acceleration (universe is expanding remember) When I&#39;m travelling at a constant 100 mph, my acceleration is 0. But the second I start speeding up, I should feel positive acceleration, which I do. In much the same way, your acceleration technically increases when you travel up the latitudes. I have a Bach in aerospace engineering and work as a computer programmer. I would like to know your credentials before you accuse me of not knowing what acceleration is lol</p>

<p>The reason why many educated people question the status quo and turn &quot;conspiracy theorists&quot; is because we know more than the average retard that goes on gulping every piece of propaganda they read/watch/hear and confuse indoctrination they receive in school for education. The more you know, the more you know how much you don&#39;t know. Its fucking easy to parrot everything you learnt in school. Try questioning the once widely accepted facts, and thats when new discoveries are made. All the great scientists did just that. Are you also naive on how scientific and critical thinking work?</p>
