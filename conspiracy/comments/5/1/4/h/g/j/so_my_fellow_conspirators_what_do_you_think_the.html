    <p class="byline text-muted mb-0"><a href="javascript:;" class="score"><span class="badge badge-secondary">30</span></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a class="author" href="../../../../../../../../user/911bodysnatchers322.html">911bodysnatchers322</a> 2016-09-04</p>
    <div class="md"><p>There are people at the helm.  Yes.  We <em>do</em> have a direction and it&#39;s clear.</p>

<p>They want a <a href="https://webbrain.com/brainpage/brain/A4276BA6-CF6E-8995-4C91-9ED993EC7D98#-202">perfect control grid</a>, what AJ said, one-world-government.  Now it&#39;s unclear why they want it (just money / social control or something else), but they want it.  They want the population under control, resources under control, people working (whether happy or not).  <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/4n6668/globalist_grand_game_plan/">This is what I think their plan is.</a></p>

<p>It&#39;s a human instrumentality project--I propose they want to turn humans into resource, hence the term &#39;human resources&#39;.  They want to optimize human resource.  And burn the candle at both ends.  Even if we had robots running all our farming and production of goods and most services, they would simply focus on making humans either go away (by putting them on a kind of dole, and keeping them in futuristic technoshantytowns) or enhance them to the point that they produce intellectual property of high value that cannot be produced yet by an AI--music, film, art, books, knowledge, wisdom, aspiration, metaobjectives, strategies, better robots, better computers, better systems, etc.  The controllers would be--like they are now--the ones reaping the lion&#39;s share of fruits of the intellectual property producers.</p>

<p>There is a Star Trek the Original Series episode called--quite ironically, if you know anything about what&#39;s going on--<em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Return_of_the_Archons">The Return of the Archons</a></em>, which seems to whisleblow on the dark agenda of those people in control.</p>

<p>It&#39;s an episode in which the Enterprise lands on a planet inhabited by robotically mind-controlled humans.  They discover it&#39;s being run by a supercomputer that puppeteers all of society.  Essentially this is a description of the matrix, or a proto-matrix before cybernetics, VR, cryostasis are fully realized-- this was straight up mind control.  </p>

<p>This society was instructed to have daily battles for 20 minutes where they could murder and beat and steal and break things.  This was to let them &#39;let off some steam&#39;.  </p>

<p>This episode mirrors our society in many ways, particularly the &#39;mind controlled society&#39; and the &#39;allowance to let off steam&#39;</p>

<p>1) we&#39;re controlled by hyperconsumerism and the illusion of choice, which is self-perpetuating--some call this the society of the spectacle; 2) we are controlled by institutions, political apathy in the face of political impotence from limited buying power in system based on money-in-politics, 3) and we&#39;re controlled by commercial interests; 4) we&#39;re controlled by systems; 5) by culture itself; 6) propaganda rules our minds; 7) commercial interests and intelligence (/state) interests have merged and are being used to control our information; and</p>

<p>8) There are many factual historical examples (revelations), and many modern intrigues around <strong>false flag events</strong>, which seem to serve the purpose of <em>a) distraction, b) division (of people of various concerns and affiliations), c) appropriation / misdirection / redirection (steering them via provocateurs--leading from the bottom &#39;powerbottoming&#39;), d) fearscaping (causing &#39;cocooning&#39;, and &#39;the shut down&#39; political apathy; or causing &#39;stockholm syndrome&#39; of justifying the establishment with nationalism), e) causing mind injury (psychological abuse and operant conditioning; abuse of symbols; unwitting participation in cryptoreligious rite and ritual (consciousness magic -- spiritual attack))</em></p>

<p>We are allowed to &quot;let off steam&quot;--to distract ourselves--in several neutral to self-injurious ways: 1) sports events including olympics, 2) vicarious <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_petite_mort">le petit mort</a> <em>emotiongasm</em> that happens after watching a gratifying film in which we identify with the tribulations and victories of the protagonist---or the punishment of the antagonist; 3) Drinking and getting together and not talking about anything <em>real</em> but instead talking about <em>buying, spending, and hyperconsumerist concerns</em>; 4) Drugs as recreational escapism--specifically the consciousness deleting opiods; 5) Buying things just to make yourself feel better; 6) Eating things just to make yourself feel better</p>

<p>See how all these activities benefit only the people who control your access to them, and the quality and content thereof?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m actually astounded by the concise summary you put forth in your comment. It&#39;s not even overly long if you consider the massive scope and complexity of the mechanisms involved. </p>

<p>It&#39;s very difficult to use the correct terminology or even describe those concepts with analogies, but I think you did a great job. Hell, it&#39;s even hard to just be aware of one single aspect of it all, let alone to pin point it and put it into words which are obviously hardly ever used in society at large. </p>

<p>Thanks.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Chaos and destruction. History repeats itself.</p>

<p>We are at a critical juncture where a large portion of the population is aware of the deceit and lies of the establishment. If we continue to push back against the propaganda we will see that mass extermination is the next step.</p>

<p>Those in power cannot allow us to keep gaining momentum. The internet has changed the game. The information wars have backfired. The &quot;democratization&quot; of other countries have become transparent as illegal regime changes.</p>

<p>If those who control us want to continue along the path they have set they will either create a civil war or a large scale war that requires a draft. It&#39;s the only way they are going to keep their heads within the next decade.</p>

<p>What they don&#39;t know is that this time around there are those who are ready to embrace the chaos and use it for obfuscation. There are those who plan to hunt down the elite and exterminate them similar to how the Israelis hunted down the Nazi power structure after WWII.</p>

<p>We are where we are today due to a few subordinates within the power structure who are pushing for this chaos, intentionally creating the opportunity to remove their masters. This is what the whistleblower crackdown is really about. The power elite are sending a message to their own ranks, not the mere sheep.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What you first need to accept and understand is that aliens have been keeping tabs on us for a very long time. The universe is awash with advanced civilizations, and there is always special interest in &quot;emerging&quot; civs such as ourselves.</p>

<p>These interests vary. Some aliens, guided by higher ethics, wish to conserve and nurture our species. Other aliens seek to exploit our planet for material and psychic resources.</p>

<p>The balancing factor is a de facto agreement between the higher civs that direct intervention is forbidden unless the human species is under imminent threat of self destruction. If any alien civ attempt to influence humans before we are advanced enough to make our own informed descisions, then significant sanctions will be taken against the offender.</p>

<p>We saw a small amount of &quot;contact&quot; after the first atomic bombs because this was the first point when humans may have been able to totally self-destruct. Aliens intervened although some had ulterior motives.They sought early trade agreements in exchange for technology transfers. This is why there was a sudden transistor/microchip tech explosion right after the atomic age began.</p>

<p>Keeping all this in mind, the end game currently in play is to force humanity to the verge of self-extinction. This is being actively directed by elite humans who truly believe that alien intervention is the only way to guarantee human peace and prosperity. These elites also believe that the tech they will eventually be given will ensure their continued dominance over the &quot;masses&quot;. This agenda is also being subtly promoted by interested alien civs.</p>

<p>The down side to all this is that Earth&#39;s resources will eventually be raped to hell. But since the elite are already doing this, it isn&#39;t much of a concern. They&#39;ll probably establish sanctuaries just like they do now, but the rest of the world will go to crap. Furthermore, the elite will have access to off world habitats so their vacation destinations will actually be improved.</p>

<p>The 2 key steps to this end game are 1) alien interaction will be forced through imminent self-destruction and 2) humans will &quot;agree&quot; to trade agreements with aliens.</p>

<p>The greedy alien civs can&#39;t just take our resourcs because of the threat of community imposed sanctions. However, if humans agree to it, there&#39;s nothing the more &quot;well meaning&quot; aliens can do.</p>

<p>1) Are there other technological civs in the universe? (Yes.)</p>

<p>2) Are they likely more advanced than us? (Yes.)</p>

<p>3) Will all technological civs have the same goals? (No.)</p>

<p>4) Is the Earth a valuable resource? (Quite possibly.)</p>

<p>This leads to:</p>

<p>5) Why hasn&#39;t Earth been exploited by superior civs?</p>

<p>6) Why was there a kind of quantum leap in engineering technology at the start of the atomic age?</p>

<p>7) Why did UFO reports apparently begin during the atomic age?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hey Dude, I&#39;m a curious one like you, and been trying to figure out the same shit for a couple decades now. Here&#39;s what I got...</p>

<p>Yeah, aliens are a big part of the story. There&#39;s lots of different groups with different agendas, attitudes and from varying dimensions and whatnot.  Nobody knows the whole story, not even them. Its not like they&#39;re all joined together in some super group that&#39;s all powerful and knowing. The universe is like Earth, tons of variety, but on a much bigger scale :) Okay, but back to us.</p>

<p>Here the Draco rule. The lizard dudes. Seems they are really f&#39;n powerful in these parts and very militaristic. They made and run the groups we&#39;d call the Illuminati or whatever to run shit down here. The Illuminati is just a conglomerate of all the different groups the Draco got running all their programs and projects. The goal is maintain control in a way that keeps us humans producing the certain emotional and spiritual energy they like to feed on. Fear, hate, terror, shit like that makes the best so they keep that going. </p>

<p>Their end game is to get us to the point where they can get us fully inserted in an actual matrix, just like the movie. Then they don&#39;t need to manage the damn Illuminati fucks anymore. We&#39;re getting close, which is why they are trimming the fat right now so to say. More on that later.</p>

<p>How&#39;d we get into this? Seems there was some big galactic war way back and our planet got seriously messed up. Bunch of refugees showed up here and they all were fighting with each other and the planet/reality was gonna get reset to fix it all, I guess planets do that if shit gets too bad. Along come the Draco and offer us a deal where we can avoid this and fix our reality. They create some sort of holographic duality layer that is great for soul growth while they run everything for us and we all would forget everything each time our soul incarnates to keep the scheme going. We do this long enough until the planet/reality is stable again and then switch back.</p>

<p>We took the deal, the easy way out. We let somebody else take the helm and fix it for us instead of doing the hard work to fix it ourselves. </p>

<p>Thing is, being bad Dracos and all, they seriously abused this situation and have been using us like cattle and playthings ever since.</p>

<p>Other entities didn&#39;t interfere because although what the Draco have done is frowned apon, its not really illegal or whatevs. </p>

<p>Alright, I&#39;ve kinda been talking past tense because I think something major has just happened. Remember the whole 2012 deal? Seems that might have had some significance after all, for both the Illuminati group down here, and the alien dudes out there.</p>

<p>That past agreement with the Draco was suppose to end. And they were gonna have everything setup for our full matrix by then. Well apparently some big important universal court type shit went down and the Draco lost. So as of last summer, they left. Not quite all of them, but the king in charge took off with everything and left his son here to by ruler, if he could. </p>

<p>With the Draco leadership gone, there was suddenly a huge power vacuum at the top. This combined with no  more instructions, caused the Illuminati as we know it to break apart into like 5 factions who are now fighting each other for control. You can see this for yourself in what&#39;s playing out in the world right now. </p>

<p>So the son that got left here was still trying to keep his rule, which is why they are getting rid of much of the old tech, programs and cabal families. Trim the fat.  Another reason so much is being exposed right now, its part of the big plan. As for the factions, they are now also finding out that they have been lied to just as much as we have. Things they were promised that aren&#39;t getting. The big decision makers are still gung ho, but many of the workers are giving up or getting out. </p>

<p>So for the first time in forever, humanity has an opportunity right now to maybe get rid of our controllers and try building the world we all want instead of the world they want. They tech exists already to fix much of our world, its just been suppressed by them.</p>

<p>Now, all this is fine and dandy for a nice big picture view. But at an even bigger view, how about you and you&#39;re personal end game?  Well, your soul decided to come here and experience this crazy rollercoaster ride that is being human. You knew what you were getting into before you came, so no matter how its turning out, its what you wanted. To experience what it like to be human. So keep on being human, whatever that is for you, its why your here :)</p>

<p>Bonus:  If this saga is really whats happening, then here&#39;s an interview that took place a couple weeks ago with a group claiming to be the alien council from the story. Crazy shit, have a listen:</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Let me throw a curve ball into this question. What do you think is going on with Zika? </p>

<p>Before you answer, consider this. The state of Florida, under Rick Scott, passed a law a <em>few years ago</em> that allowed the governor under emergency powers to force test and even vaccinate people. Now, I hear that law made it okay for them to go door to door and take urine samples from all the people in one small section of Miami. Isn&#39;t that awfully convenient, that this one small section of Miami is the epicenter of Zika and that this place is so amiable to sampling, both economically and geographically, and that the government was so quick to zero in on it, and this was <em>very shortly after</em> the propaganda had started. Recall it began in Brazil. It&#39;s obvious the whole disease is being blown out of proportion, and no doubt many of the players involved are just looking at the money signs (chemical spray companies), but this thing in Miami smacks of a controlled release and subsequent testing ( possibly for designer DNA transference via mosquito).</p>

<p>That being the case (and I won&#39;t say 100% it is, but something is certainly fishy here), how does that fit tot he question of the endgame?</p>

People are on their own out here so we need to stop looking elsewhere for extra-terrestrial saviours. Stop being Lois Lane and instead be more like Superman in this world, meaning stop screaming for help and engage yourself in fixing this mess. The endgame is meaningless if people just stop fucking around and wake up post-haste, if they did they could stop this thing dead in it&#39;s tracks. Nothing will ostensibly change until things get regressively worse and people SEE it for themselves and personally FEEL it.</p>

Economies will collapse, wars will happen and boy there will be many gone yet through it all humanity will prevail for the next millennia. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Its all based on disease and human health. They will let the healthcare dwindle to nothing, releasing pathogens and toxic materials all designed to enfeeble the capacities of people, and claim that they are having the same problems. If the masses buy into it, they will sell a cure. If not, they won&#39;t and they will just hire people to clean up the aftermath... End game though? Control while still alive. I think humanity will exist until the end of time in some way shape or form, and right up until the very last moment, we will continue attempting to bring the starting line to the finish line. Truth is, everybody gets there, to the finish line, the great beyond where control is moot. The living are just obsessed with controlling even that. Sad really because they are just denying and delaying their destinies by insisting on driving the whole rig.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s the scariest part OP, there is no end game and no one knows what the hell is going on. Everyone is individually driven and the ego gets in the way. It&#39;s frightening really, the idea that no one is in control and its chaos. I think that&#39;s why most people like to believe in the NWO and the 1%. They need the fear. They want to blame someone and most importantly, they want to be told someone is In control. </p>
