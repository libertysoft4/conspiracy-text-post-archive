<p>Somehow this big celeb death totally escaped press here in <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a></p>

<p><a href="http://imgur.com/a/0FZnH">Wikipedia screenshot</a></p>

<p>I found out by seeing &#39;recommendations&#39; on youtube.  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRazFAK1gzE">Gene Wilder on Conan.</a>.  Published on youtube the day he died, apparently.  I watched it.  People in youtube comments were saying RIP Gene Wilder.  Then I said to myself, &quot;NO, he&#39;s not dead...that&#39;s mandela effect stuff, you guys are confused.  Others I spoke with had thought he was dead also&quot;  </p>

<p><a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/4s44lq/more_mandela_effect_gene_wilder_is_still_alive/">More Mandela Effect : Gene Wilder is still alive</a> -- published just 1 month ago.</p>

<p>So I <em>thought he was still alive</em>, that <em>these others in youtube were confused</em>.  Turns out I was the one who was wrong.  Think it&#39;s curious it was posted a month after I posted mandela effect.  <em>Coincidental but disturbing to say the least.</em></p>

<p>RIP Original and one-true-Wonka
RIP FrankenstEEN /stein (don&#39;t even get me started on that)</p>

<p>Read the Bible sometime, you stupid bint.</p>

<p>The most rabid Zionist supporters are evangelicals, so the best way to counter them is to actually teach them the Bible. Most evangelicals are cults of personality with Bible flavoring and preach utter heresy–dual covenant theology and Zionism, for starters. The following are the best arguments for debating and trumping zionist evangelicals:</p>

<p><em>Behold, I will make them of the synagogue of Satan, which say they are Jews, and are not, but do lie; behold, I will make them to come and worship before thy feet, and to know that I have loved thee.</em>
<strong>– Revelation 3:9</strong></p>

<p>This points out how the Jews, as they call themselves, are not Godly, and that their subversion was predicted.</p>

<p><em>And if ye be Christ’s, then are ye Abraham’s seed, and heirs according to the promise.</em>
<strong>– Galatians 3:29</strong></p>

<p>This destroys any notion of a Jewish right to the land of Israel based on the Bible, as the chosen people are those that accept Christ as savior–not a particular race and certainly not those that rejected Him.</p>

<p><em>Whosoever denieth the Son, the same hath not the Father: (but) he that acknowledgeth the Son hath the Father also.</em>
<strong>– 1 John 2:23</strong></p>

<p>This destroys the idea that the Jews are still the chosen people, because they have denied Christ and so have denied God.</p>

<p><em>Then said Jesus to those Jews which believed on him, If ye continue in my word, then are ye my disciples indeed; And ye shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free. They answered him, We be Abraham’s seed, and were never in bondage to any man: how sayest thou, Ye shall be made free?</em></p>

<p><em>Jesus answered them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Whosoever committeth sin is the servant of sin. And the servant abideth not in the house for ever: but the Son abideth ever. If the Son therefore shall make you free, ye shall be free indeed. I know that ye are Abraham’s seed; but ye seek to kill me, because my word hath no place in you. I speak that which I have seen with my Father: and ye do that which ye have seen with your father.</em></p>

<p><em>They answered and said unto him, Abraham is our father. Jesus saith unto them, If ye were Abraham’s children, ye would do the works of Abraham. But now ye seek to kill me, a man that hath told you the truth, which I have heard of God: this did not Abraham. Ye do the deeds of your father. Then said they to him, We be not born of fornication; we have one Father, even God.</em></p>

<p><em>Jesus said unto them, If God were your Father, ye would love me: for I proceeded forth and came from God; neither came I of myself, but he sent me. Why do ye not understand my speech? even because ye cannot hear my word. Ye are of your father the devil, and the lusts of your father ye will do. He was a murderer from the beginning, and abode not in the truth, because there is no truth in him. When he speaketh a lie, he speaketh of his own: for he is a liar, and the father of it. And because I tell you the truth, ye believe me not. Which of you convinceth me of sin? And if I say the truth, why do ye not believe me? He that is of God heareth God&#39;s words: ye therefore hear them not, because ye are not of God.</em>
<strong>– John 8:31-47</strong></p>

<p>~:~</p>

<p>The main problem stems from the fact that the word Jew/Judaism has multiple meanings, but most people don&#39;t realize this. This confusion was brought about intentionally. The word Jew was invented a couple centuries ago in English translations of the Bible as a shortened form of the word Judean. This refers to the province of Judea, which at the time of the New Testament was a multi-racial, multicultural area, whose capital city was Jerusalem, which was controlled by the Pharisees. Jesus and most of his disciples did not come from Judea–they came from Galilee–and therefore were not Jews by the Biblical definition. Judea was originally inhabited by the Israeli tribe of Judah, but by this point was quite mixed. Whereas Galilee was inhabited only by the Israeli tribe of Benjamin. The only disciple that was a Jew was Judas, who betrayed Jesus.</p>

<p>The Pharisees were the evil Talmudists who Jesus opposed, and who ultimately got Jesus killed for daring to disagree with them. Later, Jerusalem was destroyed, and some Pharisees survived and became rootless nomads. Along the way they mixed with more people who converted to Talmudism. Then, after the invention of the English word Jew, the Talmudists started calling themselves Jews, and renamed their religion Judaism. They started claiming that they’re the people who lived in ancient Israel, and that they’re the “chosen people” spoken of in the Bible. In reality, their religion completely contradicts the Old Testament–even the Torah–and they know it, but they’ll never admit it. They brought about such a deliberate conflation and confusion of the word Jew that today people now use a definition of Jew that is expanded to include everyone in ancient Israel when that’s not at all what Jew meant originally. They also like to conflate Judaism with Hebrewism, but the religion of the Pharisees (Talmudism) only began after they returned from captivity in Babylon, and the Old Testament religion of the Hebrew people before that was quite different. Today, only a tiny minority of people who call themselves “Jews” don’t follow the Talmud.</p>

<p>The modern confusion comes from the fact that most people–even most Christians–don’t realize this linguistic and historical deception. This is especially true of the English-speaking world (Protestants, foremost), due to modern, bastardized, heretical translations of the Bible, plus a divorce from the true traditions of the original Christian church. They’ve totally forgotten how the Jews persecuted Christians endlessly before Christians eventually gained power through the Roman Empire and started dishing it right back to them. Just like a nation becomes ruined when it forgets its own history, the same is true of a religion. In fact, the same arguments used to claim that Christianity is inherently weak because it has now been subverted can be used to say that Western nations are inherently weak because they have been subverted, or that white people are inherently weak because a genocide is being committed upon them thanks to their altruism. It’s just not a good argument at all.</p>
