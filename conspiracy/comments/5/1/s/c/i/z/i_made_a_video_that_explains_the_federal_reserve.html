<p>I&#39;ve been studying the Federal Reserve for a while and decided to make a video that sums it up as quickly and concisely as possible.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks, I appreciate that!  I notice a lot of videos spend most of the time talking about Rothschild, or the fact that it&#39;s a private bank, or that it was created during some secret meeting on jekyll island, but don&#39;t spend enough time explaining how they literally stole everyone&#39;s gold, or how they transitioned from gold certificates to Federal Reserve Notes, or how all of this impacts the average person!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>history — how did the fed come about? At least briefly mention the contention that was faced trying to bring it in.</p>

<p>accounting — how could the public know if the gold was there, besides a run on the Fed?</p>

<p>You explain how the dollar became a fiat currency quite well, and how this devalued the dollar and how this impacts savings, but you don’t say why it was done by the government/Fed.</p>

<p>You bring it in too briefly at the end.</p>

<p>Also, mention land as a good investment.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I like your video, I also agree with the criticisms of your microphone.</p>

<p>I disagree that a dollar needs to be tied to gold. I believe if a dollar were tied to gold it would prevent this runaway wealth, and perhaps other benefits, but I don&#39;t believe dollars being tied to gold bullion is essential.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I do not believe it is essential either.  But understanding the gold standard helps to understand how the Federal Reserve stole everyone&#39;s gold.  </p>

<p>It&#39;s not the fiat dollar I have a problem with, it&#39;s the Fed&#39;s monopoly on money that is the problem.  Or at least was the problem until cryptocurrency came along!</p>

<p>Crypto is going to do to the fed what netflix did to blockbuster! </p>

<p>Thanks for your interest in the movie!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Does holding your investments in diversified stocks generally preserve your wealth in a hyperinflation type of scenario? </p>

<p>Since you technically own a fractional portion of a companies with real competitive advantages, their stock value should increase as inflation increases, preferably at a greater rate, correct?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Possibly!  Assuming the company was able to stay in business under such harsh economic conditions!</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know what the future will bring, but If I&#39;m going to store my wealth in numbers on a computer screen, they&#39;re going to be Bitcoins and other crypto, not stocks. I&#39;m betting against the economy.  Not because I want the system to fail, but because it looks pretty obvious that it&#39;s going to.</p>

<p>Maybe I&#39;ll buy some stocks afterwords, once the dow gold ratio bottoms out again!</p>

<p>Except the bitcoin part in the end, which is no different than any other FIAT currency out there driven by how you explained it, supply and demand, which is exactly how bitcoin is priced.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Everything is priced by supply and demand!  Bitcoin and fiat are similar in the sense that neither are backed by a physical commodity, but that is where their similarities end.  </p>

<p>Bitcoin has a totally transparent open source peer to peer network and a secure public ledger known as the blockchain.   While fiat is just he opposite.   In 2006 the Federal Reserve stopped publishing the M3 money supply (broadest measure of the money supply).   So the Fed doesn&#39;t even tell you how much currency there is, or  keep a secure public ledger of all transactions.</p>

<p>The fed is completely shrouded in secrecy, while Bitcoin is completely transparent.  Not only that, but work has to be done to produce Bitcoins.  Essentially they are backed by processing power.  While the Fed on the other hand just waves their magic wand, and presto, trillions of dollars spring into existence! </p>

<p>Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are a new and exciting technology!  If you have any questions feel free to PM me!</p>
