I don&#39;t mean people like me, I mean the zionists on television committing terrorist acts under the guise of security. It&#39;s funny, every single fucking person in power is either Jewish or a Christian ultra-zionist. They realize if they are christian they have to make up for it to the Jews by going even more hard-line zionist. These traitors are fucking everywhere. Get over it, it has nothing to do with racism. It&#39;s simply reality, you just have to get over your decades of brainwashing where everytime someone on television judged someone by their skin color they were called a racist. Turns out stereotyping is a very natural human tendency because it works.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The Mafia in New York City was controlled by just five families and they were all run by Italians, then it&#39;s common sense that organized crime controlled by Italians.</p>

<p>This is true.</p>

<p>Yet there were/are plenty of Italians not all involved in the Mafia. Plenty of broke Italians getting screwed over just as hard, if not harder by the Mafia. </p>

<p>If you were to use &quot;Italians&quot; to refer to the Mafia the same was people use &quot;Jews&quot; / &quot;Zionists&quot; to refer to a handful of incredibly powerful and devious actors, then people would make the same accusations against you.</p>

<p>Another example would be &quot;Skull N Bones.&quot; There are clearly a lot of rich, influential, corrupt people involved in that Secret Society. They control a ton of things and do each other favors. However, your random Yale student isn&#39;t involved with this organization and isn&#39;t getting a favors or benefits from this organization.</p>

<p>You hurt your case by not being able to make these distinctions. A select group of Jewish people may control the media, but to assume that has anything to do with all Jews is ludicrous.</p>

<p>There are some Jews who benefit greatly from Israel existing. The vast majority though are getting elevated levels of skin cancer living in a desert hell hole because they&#39;ve been sold the idea of it as the promised land, and the cognitive dissonance is just to great for them to realize that they&#39;re simply the ~10 million person human shield for a giant military base in the Middle East.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hi, Jew here. Judaism is broken into segments. I&#39;m reform, so I&#39;ll speak from a reform perspective. There is not a reform Jew in the world who accepts what you&#39;re talking about as core tenets of Judaism--in fact, frankly, I would argue (and I bet my Rabbi would, too) that, in this day and age, anybody who thinks non-Jews are &quot;cattle,&quot; that they should be murdered, or that we should continue practicing various rituals described in our older texts, well, those people are the ones being untrue to what Judaism is. I&#39;m sorry you have such a dim view of our religion. I&#39;m not angry about it, and I&#39;d imagine this is going to go rather poorly for me on this subreddit, but I wanted to at least speak up to express the notion that, no, &quot;being Jewish&quot; is a much, much broader, diverse, and progressive concept than people here think. If you want to talk about the ultra-orthodox zionist extremists? Yeah, they&#39;re basically our version of terrorists. But they aren&#39;t me, nor do they represent me. And that goes for the vast, vast majority of Jews out there, particularly in America. If you want to actually talk about this stuff, I&#39;d be happy to talk about it. If not, no worries. Like I said: just wanted to get that out there. </p>

<p>The Khazars were from Sumeria which was the remnants from the last cataclysm. I think they were the opportunistic ones who stayed on after the cataclysm to rule the world through their knowledge of the occult.</p>

<p>I think they&#39;re the more outlaws, and the more structured hierarchy was preserved through the Vedic stuff and eastern dynasties. </p>

<p>The brotherhood of the snake play both sides of the NWO I think.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Traditional monetary usury is not clear cut forbidden <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamic_banking_and_finance#Usury_in_Islam">as glimpsed here</a>. </p>

<p>One must inspect much deeper... </p>

<p>The word riba in arabic is defined  as <a href="http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/morph?l=ribA&amp;amp;la=ar&amp;amp;can=riba0">&quot;interest, usury&quot;</a>. Money is not mentioned in the definition. </p>

<p>Riba is the root of the word <a href="http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A2002.02.0024%3Aroot%3DrbT%3Aentry%3DribaATN">ribaATN</a>, of which the definition essentially describes as usury of DNA creatures that ties &amp; binds them. </p>

<p>RibaATN is a compound word built of riba + ATN. <a href="http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A2002.02.0017%3Aentry%3DAtn%7E">ATN</a> is defined as &quot;He, or it&quot; &amp; thusly building the word ribaATN which defines <em>usury by way of bondage slavery</em> the form of usury I state is book fed to muslims.</p>

<p>Slavery or death is mandated in Islam for those not of the book &amp; <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jizya">Jizya</a> for those of the book. Jizya is extortion instead of death or slavery to those who do not submit them themselves to be enslaved by the quran while giving up their earlier abrahamic books. </p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>The term extortion is often used metaphorically to refer to usury</em> or to price-gouging, though neither is legally considered extortion. It is also often used loosely to refer to everyday situations where one person feels indebted against their will, to another, in order to receive an essential service or avoid legal consequences. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extortion">source</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Slavery &amp; extortion of individuals is usury mandated by Islam &amp; book fed in Islam, of which I SLAM!!! for the quran is a book dictating submission, enslavement &amp; slaughter as a way.</p>

<p>Thank you for asking for further explanation in a polite civilized manner. Have a nice day ;)</p>
