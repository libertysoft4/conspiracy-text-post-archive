        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Structural engineers who designed the Twin Towers carried out studies in the mid-1960s to determine how the buildings would fare if hit by large jetliners. In all cases the studies concluded that <strong>the Towers would survive the impacts and fires caused by the jetliners</strong></p>

<p>Contrary to widely promoted misconceptions, the Boeing 767-200s used on 9/11/01 were only slightly larger than 707s and DC 8s, the types of jetliners whose impacts the World Trade Center&#39;s designers anticipated</p>

<p><a href="http://911research.wtc7.net/wtc/analysis/docs/aircraftcomparison.gif">FEMA&#39;s Report shows the sizes of a 707 and a 767 relative to the footprint of a WTC tower.</a>  Flight 11 and Flight 175 were Boeing 767-200s. Although a 767-200 has a slightly wider body than a 707, the two models are very similar in overall size, weight and fuel capacity</p>

</tbody></table>

<p>Given the differences in cruise speeds, a 707 in normal flight would actually have more kinetic energy than a 767, despite the slightly smaller size. Note the similar fuel capacities of both aircraft. The 767s used on September 11th were estimated to be carrying about 10,000 gallons of fuel each at the time of impact, only about 40% of the capacity of a 707</p>

<p><strong>Statements by Engineers</strong></p>

<p>John Skilling was the head structural engineer for the World Trade Center. In a 1993 interview, Skilling stated that the Towers were designed to withstand the impact and fires resulting from the collision of a large jetliner such as Boeing 707 or Douglas DC-8.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><a href="http://community.seattletimes.nwsource.com/archive/?date=19930227&amp;slug=1687698">Our analysis indicated the biggest problem would be the fact that all the fuel (from the airplane) would dump into the building. There would be a horrendous fire. A lot of people would be killed, ... The building structure would still be there</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>A white paper released on February 3, 1964 states that the Towers could have withstood impacts of jetliners travelling 600 mph -- a speed greater than the impact speed of either jetliner used on 9/11</p>

<blockquote>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/City-Sky-World-Trade-Center/dp/0805076913">The buildings have been investigated and found to be safe in an assumed collision with a large jet airliner (Boeing 707—DC 8) traveling at 600 miles per hour. Analysis indicates that such collision would result in only local damage which could not cause collapse or substantial damage to the building and would not endanger the lives and safety of occupants not in the immediate area of impact, page 131</a></p>
</blockquote>

<hr/>

<p><a href="http://www.statemaster.com/encyclopedia/Factor-of-safety">One aspect of engineering that is not widely understood is that structures are over-engineered as a matter of standard practice.</a>  Steel structures like bridges and buildings are typically designed to withstand five times anticipated static loads and 3 times anticipated dynamic loads.</p>

<p>Anti-science?

<p>Show me an example of your calculations showing how the buildings came down in 10-11 seconds,  1/10 second per floor while there was still substantial remaining steel structure below the level of damage.    Set an example as a professional engineer.    I predict you can&#39;t,  and won&#39;t,  and will employ another diversion tactic.</p>

<p>The observed materials failure behavior on video documents something beyond jet impact,  fires,  and gravity.   Have you seen the videos?    Are you  not concerned with what you saw?    There are dozens of anomalies.    And then you apply the math,  and look at the cover up performed by NIST and FEMA,  the bogus 9/11 commission.    </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Leslie Robertson <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leslie_E._Robertson">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leslie_E._Robertson</a>
who do you think it was?
Robertson took the time to calculate how well his towers would handle the impact from a Boeing 707, the largest jetliner in service at the time. He says that his calculations assumed a plane lost in a fog while searching for an airport at relatively low speed, like the B-25 bomber. He concluded that the towers would remain standing despite the force of the impact and the hole it would punch out. The new technologies he had installed after the motion experiments and wind-tunnel work had created a structure more than strong enough to withstand such a blow.</p>

<p>Exactly how Robertson performed these calculations is apparently lost -- he says he cannot find a copy of the report. Several engineers who worked with him at the time, including the director of his computer department, say they have no recollection of ever seeing the study. But the Port Authority, eager to mount a counterattack against Wien, seized on the results -- and may in fact have exaggerated them. One architect working for the Port Authority issued a statement to the press, covered in a prominent article in The Times, explaining that Robertson&#39;s study proved that the towers could withstand the impact of a jetliner moving at 600 miles an hour. That was perhaps three times the speed that Robertson had considered. If Robertson saw the article in the paper, he never spoke up about the discrepancy. No one else issued a correction, and the question was answered in many people&#39;s minds: the towers were as safe as could be expected, even in the most cataclysmic of circumstances.</p>

<p>There were only two problems. The first, of course, was that no study of the impact of a 600-mile-an-hour plane ever existed. &#39;&#39;That&#39;s got nothing to do with the reality of what we did,&#39;&#39; Robertson snapped when shown the Port Authority architect&#39;s statement more than three decades later. The second problem was that no one thought to take into account the fires that would inevitably break out when the jetliner&#39;s fuel exploded, exactly as the B-25&#39;s had. And if Wien was the trade center&#39;s Cassandra, fire protection would become its Achilles&#39; heel.

<p>Robertson is also on record, 21 days after 9/11, with this claim</p>

<blockquote>
<p><a href="http://911review.com/articles/griffin/nyc1.html#_ednref33">“As of 21 days after the attack, the fires were still burning and <strong>molten steel was still running</strong>”</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Years later he claims that he had...</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“never run across anyone who has said that they had in fact seen molten metal.” - Leslie Robertson </p>
</blockquote>

<p>This statement is again a complete lie, the fact that Robertson himself claimed to have seen it in a published news report! This contradicts his own statement about seeing molten metal.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>so although it appears they designed the building to withstand the a 600mph jet hit they didn&#39;t design to withstand the fire.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Robertson says that the building was not designed to survive jet fuel fires, but there is no historical record of any statement made pre 9/11 that supports this quote...</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“To the best of our knowledge, little was known about the effects of a fire - Leslie Robertson”. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>This claim is suspicious for two reasons: why would they design the towers to survive plane crashes without considering the jet fuel? And more importantly, <a href="http://community.seattletimes.nwsource.com/archive/?date=19930227&amp;amp;slug=1687698">John Skilling claimed in 1993 that they did consider the jet fuel when they designed the buildings.</a> </p>

<p>Regardless, fires did not collapse any of the three skyscrapers on 9/11, there are now peer reviewed scientific papers that categorically confirm this.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Here&#39;s a lesson in how to skeptic.  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Our analysis indicated the biggest problem would be the fact that all the fuel (from the airplane) would dump into the building. There would be a horrendous fire. A lot of people would be killed, ... The building structure would still be there</p>
</blockquote>

<p>How much trust can we put into that analysis of a hypothetical situation that would have been <em>extremely</em> difficult to model?  </p>

<p>The NIST reports that the 1968 New York City building code — which the towers were intended but not required to meet when they were built - required a two-hour fire rating for the floor system.  How long and how hot did the fires burn in that analytical model that conclude they wouldn&#39;t collapse?  </p>

<p>From the NIST report: </p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;The fire conditions in the towers on 9-11 were far more extreme than those to which floor systems in standard U.S. fire rating tests are subjected,&quot; Sunder says. &quot;Our investigation&#39;s final assessment of how the floor system performed in the WTC fires also must consider factors such as the combustible fuel load of the hijacked jets, the extent and number of floors involved, the rate of the fire spread across and between floors, ventilation conditions, and the impact of the aircraft-damaged towers&#39; ability to resist the fire.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Did the model they ran that concluded &quot;no collapse&quot; effectively cover the range of possibilities?  Given that it would have been done long before widespread CAD, even before finite element analysis (aka finite difference modeling) was much known outside academic circles,<sup>*</sup> it&#39;s a safe guess that the model was entirely too simplistic.      </p>

<p>Are there any other differences between the the scenario declaring them safe and what happened in 2001?   </p>

<blockquote>
<p>One aspect of engineering that is not widely understood is that structures are over-engineered as a matter of standard practice. Steel structures like bridges and buildings are typically designed to withstand five times anticipated static loads and 3 times anticipated dynamic loads</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Those margins apply to <em>expected</em> conditions.  Which has nothing to do with the airplane crash scenario, an unexpected condition. (No, a plane crash is not that type of &quot;dynamic load&quot;)  As it is  irrelevant to the case they are trying to make, and in fact serves only to muddy the water, bringing it up only serves to arouse my suspicion. As it should yours.    </p>

<p>Next, were the buildings built <em>exactly</em> as designed?  No need to go search for the answer, I can tell you right now they weren&#39;t.  The design called for asbestos and midway through construction they changed to other materials.  That analysis mentioned earlier?  What fireproofing material did they use in the analytical model? Some of the new materials hadn&#39;t even been fully tested yet so it is <em>very</em> unlikely those material properties were in the model.  </p>

<p>Was the fireproofing properly applied?  According to <a href="http://www.fireengineering.com/articles/print/volume-155/issue-10/world-trade-center-disaster/volume-ii-the-ruins-and-the-rebirth/fireproofing-at-the-wtc-towers.html">this page at fireengineering.com</a>, no. </p>

<p>An excerpt:   </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Top and bottom chords and truss web members were exposed, and the red lead on the trusses was clearly visible in many locations. Photo 1 shows a truss with fireproofing missing from its end where it meets the outside wall. Also, the fireproofing was frequently thinner than the 3/4 inch described in the Federal Emergency Management Agency-funded ASCE BPAT report on the collapse of the towers. Many of the problems observed were clearly the result of poor workmanship.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Next, was the fireproofing material that <em>was</em> installed still in place?  Again, according to that fireengineering.com page, the answer is &quot;no.&quot; </p>

<blockquote>
<p>I inspected core columns up to the 78th floor but was unable to access them above that point. These inspections revealed that the bond of fireproofing on core columns had failed in many locations and the fireproofing was falling off the columns in floor-high sheets. Photo 3, taken in 1994, shows a core column from which the fireproofing had fallen off in a sheet that is several stories high.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That page lists several other cases of missing, damaged, misapplied, or just plain fucked up fireproofing.   </p>

<p>Additionally, the NIST report cites &quot;fireproofing material displacement&quot; which may be have occurred due to the force of the impacts, such displacement exposing even more structural elements .  Did the model account for that possibility?  &quot;No&quot; would be a very good guess.  </p>

<p>Thus endeth today&#39;s lesson.  </p>

<p>* I was introduced to FEA/FDM when working for a USDA watershed research center at a large university, in the mid 80s.  The literature at that time was full of faulty models, predicting things that aren&#39;t physically possible / unexplainable by the analytical models. People rapidly gravitated toward the computational method though, because the analytical models  are frequently ... intractable, let&#39;s say, if not downright unworkable. </p>

<p>ETA: Bonus lesson in skepticing.  So the planes might have been fairly similar, so what.  Stipulating that there were no significant differences between the planes used in the original analysis and the ones that did crash into WTC, doesn&#39;t imply that something is rotten in Denmark. &quot;WHOA it must be due to [conspiracy theory N]!&quot; is NOT a necessary or even warranted conclusion.  A much better place to look for an explanation for the discrepancy is asking whether the original analysis may have been flawed, or even applicable. IOW, if the <em>planes</em> weren&#39;t substantially different between the analysis and 9/11, <em>what else</em> <strong>was different</strong>?  To properly skeptic you address the next <em>logical</em> place where an explanation may be found, you don&#39;t go running off willy nilly on purely speculative wild notions. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>What? No, I&#39;m agreeing with you. Buildings in the 60s and 70s may lack the fancy technology that we have now, but it doesn&#39;t mean that the engineering wouldn&#39;t hold up. They&#39;re actually probably stronger with all the steel that, by today&#39;s standards, might be unnecessary because we have more efficient technology now (doing more with less, sleeker, etc). </p>

<p>Edit: ok maybe it wasn&#39;t a great analogy lol. I was thinking Smart Car vs. 1970s Charger. Smart car has more advanced technology, but it doesn&#39;t mean that the Charger wasn&#39;t a brick of steel. Buildings now might be more efficiently designed, but it doesn&#39;t mean that buildings back then weren&#39;t strong. </p>

<p>Are you insinuating if it somehow &quot;fell slower&quot; that it would be okay that it collapsed?  Gravity took over and did what it does, it pulled the structure down when the supports could no longer support it.  The supports don&#39;t need to disappear instantly, they simply need to bear a load beyond their design and beyond the strength of the framework, and then they fail and crumple.</p>

<p>If the buildings energy was used to crumple the supports, then the building would not have gone into freefall, this is high school level basic physics.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Leslie Robertson <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leslie_E._Robertson">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leslie_E._Robertson</a>
who do you think it was?
Robertson took the time to calculate how well his towers would handle the impact from a Boeing 707, the largest jetliner in service at the time. He says that his calculations assumed a plane lost in a fog while searching for an airport at relatively low speed, like the B-25 bomber. He concluded that the towers would remain standing despite the force of the impact and the hole it would punch out. The new technologies he had installed after the motion experiments and wind-tunnel work had created a structure more than strong enough to withstand such a blow.</p>

<p>Exactly how Robertson performed these calculations is apparently lost -- he says he cannot find a copy of the report. Several engineers who worked with him at the time, including the director of his computer department, say they have no recollection of ever seeing the study. But the Port Authority, eager to mount a counterattack against Wien, seized on the results -- and may in fact have exaggerated them. One architect working for the Port Authority issued a statement to the press, covered in a prominent article in The Times, explaining that Robertson&#39;s study proved that the towers could withstand the impact of a jetliner moving at 600 miles an hour. That was perhaps three times the speed that Robertson had considered. If Robertson saw the article in the paper, he never spoke up about the discrepancy. No one else issued a correction, and the question was answered in many people&#39;s minds: the towers were as safe as could be expected, even in the most cataclysmic of circumstances.</p>

<p>There were only two problems. The first, of course, was that no study of the impact of a 600-mile-an-hour plane ever existed. &#39;&#39;That&#39;s got nothing to do with the reality of what we did,&#39;&#39; Robertson snapped when shown the Port Authority architect&#39;s statement more than three decades later. The second problem was that no one thought to take into account the fires that would inevitably break out when the jetliner&#39;s fuel exploded, exactly as the B-25&#39;s had. And if Wien was the trade center&#39;s Cassandra, fire protection would become its Achilles&#39; heel.
