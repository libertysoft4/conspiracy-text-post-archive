<p><strong>Canadian Civil Engineering Researchers Disprove Official Explanation of WTC 7’s Destruction</strong></p>

<p>Noting the many shortcomings in Bažant&#39;s analysis, which have been studied and criticized extensively since 2001, Korol and his colleagues set out to apply a much more rigorous methodology for analyzing WTC 7, which, according to the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), collapsed from normal office fires.</p>

<p>Korol and his colleagues set out to apply a much more rigorous methodology for analyzing WTC 7.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Dr. Robert Korol, professor emeritus of civil engineering at McMaster University in Hamilton, Ontario, and a fellow of the Canadian Society for Civil Engineering, has led a team of academic researchers in preparing two peer-reviewed scientific papers on the destruction of World Trade Center Building 7. Both papers were published in the Challenge Journal of Structural Mechanics — the first one in July 2015, the second in February 2016.</p>

<p>Prior to publishing these papers, the team of researchers carefully reviewed the work of Zdeněk Bažant, a professor of Civil Engineering and Materials Science at Northwestern University, who had published a paper shortly after 9/11 focusing on the collapses of WTC 1 and 2. Entitled “Why Did the World Trade Center Collapse?—Simple Analysis,” Bažant’s paper presented “a simplified approximate analysis of the overall collapse of the towers of World Trade Center in New York on September 11, 2001.”</p>

<p>Noting the many shortcomings in Bažant&#39;s analysis, which have been studied and criticized extensively since 2001, Korol and his colleagues set out to apply a much more rigorous methodology for analyzing WTC 7, which, according to the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), collapsed from normal office fires. As Korol explains, “WTC 7 is a particularly useful example, because there isn&#39;t the concern about trying to predict the amount of heat generated by spewing jet fuel and having it ignited within a building. It&#39;s the materials within the building that generate the heat release.”</p>

<p>The greater certainty about the material properties involved would allow the team to evaluate whether WTC 7 could have collapsed as a result of burning materials being ejected from WTC 1 and igniting fires on the 12th and 13th floors. The team’s analysis eventually led them to conclude that even with very high estimates for the amount of combustible materials present in office buildings — using the maximum amounts allowed in the building codes — and making many other generous assumptions, such as having two floors “totally ablaze with raging inferno fires,” WTC 7 still would not collapse.</p>

<p>NIST could not have been correct in claiming that such a failure mechanism could have resulted in the collapse.</p>

<p>Korol’s July 2015 paper, <a href="http://www.challengejournal.com/index.php/cjsmec/article/download/36/19">“Performance-based fire protection of office buildings: A case study based on the collapse of WTC 7,”</a> used accepted equations associated with thermodynamics and heat transfer to determine how much heat could be generated from office fires. Studying the type of fire that would occur in a typical office arrangement with cubicle partitions, he and his fellow researchers derived the temperature that would have been reached based on the heat release rate of combustible materials identified by NIST and others.</p>

<p>Given that high burn rates do not generally last longer than about 30 minutes and that fires in office buildings do not occur over entire floors simultaneously, Korol says that the assumption of having the entire area of the 12th and 13th floors ablaze was “a ridiculously conservative estimate for the purposes of determining the consequences to the building.” Even then, the researchers showed the temperatures to be insufficient to push a girder off its seat near Column 79, thus disproving NIST’s claim that such a failure mechanism initiated the collapse of the building.</p>

<p>In the subsequent February 2016 paper, <a href="http://www.challengejournal.com/index.php/cjsmec/article/download/50/41">“The collapse of WTC 7: A re-examination of the “simple analysis” approach,”</a> Korol considered the “virtually impossible circumstance” that the building experienced an inferno on two adjacent stories simultaneously. Noting that collapses do not occur instantaneously, Korol explains that even if two-thirds of the columns in a building are somehow “wiped out by virtue of the high heat, then the remaining one-third would still be sufficient to prevent collapse.”</p>

<p>According to Korol, Bažant assumed that any possible collapse would only be localized in the form of a plastic hinge; however, Korol’s team went further in terms of assessing the capacity of the columns. “Whereas Bažant assumed that there was only bending energy, we say these columns were resisting load axially — and Bažant ignored that.”</p>

<p>Robert Korol 2Dr. Korol has done extensive research on the axial loading properties of steel columns and beams. He appeared in the documentary “9/11 in the Academic Community,” and is seen here in his laboratory in Hamilton, Ontario, Canada.</p>

<p>Korol’s team painstakingly analyzed what would happen if WTC 7 experienced fire-induced failures of more than two-thirds of the columns on both floors 12 and 13. The researchers performed lab tests to determine the amount of resistance for the upper block of WTC 7 to come down to the floor level of story 13. Assuming that the floor slabs of floors 12 and 13 were so hot that the concrete was pulverized without any applied load (an unrealistically generous assumption), the only energy associated with the structure in those two stories would have been that of the 26 columns that had not yet failed. Accounting for the remaining amount of resistance in the building, Korol et al. found that while the 11th story would collapse, there was still enough remaining energy in the building that the structure would not fail below that point.</p>

<p>Korol and his colleagues also undertook tests at McMaster University with regard to pulverization of concrete that is typically specified for floors incorporating ductile steel to restrain lateral motion. He explains, “Crushing is not an effective way of transforming brittle material into pulverized material. When you combine that with the 82 columns, there is no way the building is going to come down.”</p>

<p>Dr. Korol and his team are not yet done with their work. They are now conducting a study of the potential for fire-induced collapse of steel-framed office buildings in general, using a 50-story building as an example. The study will examine eight different fire scenarios, four of which will consider 4 adjacent stories experiencing raging fires as might be conceived from airplane strikes at various height locations. This work builds on the research described in the two papers discussed here — and none of the scenarios being studied has resulted in a complete building collapse.</p>

<p>The question that remains to be answered is whether Korol’s peers in their engineering community will begin to pay attention — or if they will, instead, continue to accept on blind faith NIST’s fantastical explanation for the destruction of WTC 7. - <strong>by Mike Bondi, P.Eng.</strong></p>

    <div class="md"><p>Dear moderators,</p>

<p>I think this submission would be a great sticky post for the 9/11 anniversary. I think almost every 9/11 skeptic can agree building 7 is a glaring issue. I, along with many other dedicated subscribers, put a lot of time and effort into the science behind the NIST reports. The fraud in these reports is undeniable in a debate, and that&#39;s why we choose to focus on their flaws. These peer reviewed papers are priceless tools to help dismantle the official report considering NIST will not allow for peer review. The 9/11 faithers always resort to <em>well then show us your peer reviewed work</em> -- and now we have just that. </p>

<p>Thank you for the consideration. This is probably the most exciting work I&#39;ve come across in years. </p>

<p>Yes, when it falls through a vacuum. Not when it falls through an atmosphere, then a little or a lot of friction occurs, depending on the atmosphere. In a liquid, even more friction occurs, which slows down the fall even more. </p>

<p>So calling the free fall of an object through tons of structural, solid steel &quot;normal&quot; betrays an epistemology of physics that leaves much room for improvement. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>There are three meanings of &quot;free fall&quot;: it can mean moving in a vacuum where only gravity is acting on the object- wherein the acceleration is totally constant- it can mean falling at terminal velocity- wherein the velocity is constant and the acceleration is zero- or, more colloquially, it can mean falling without the resistance of forces besides air pressure, like in skydiving before deploying a chute. I assumed he meant the last one since the first two wouldn&#39;t make any sense here even in the case of sabotage.</p>

<p>You asked, wrt WTC7&#39;s free fall:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>is falling at free fall from gravity not normal? isn&#39;t that what gravity does</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So no, it is not &quot;normal&quot; for a building to fall without the resistance of forces besides air pressure unless all forces besides air pressure have been removed simultaneously. For typically, a building <em>consists</em> of forces resisting gravity - it is the whole frigging point. </p>

You can&#39;t have a few localised fires destroy entire floors at exactly the same time to achieve this. At least, it has never happened before. And it seems very unlikely as the fuel requirements are just be too big.</p>

<hr/>

<p>For anyone reading, here&#39;s the thing about the importance of all this information coming recently, and I will try to be as short and focused on the most important aspects without going all technical:</p>

<p>NIST claimed that the fires in WTC7 wouldn&#39;t last for more than 30 minutes under the fire loads they contained. Their analysis results showed that those office fires caused the steel temperatures to reach about 570 ºF and as a direct result the thermal expansion caused the displacement of a vital support and resulted in total collapse of the building.</p>

<p>Using the same base data (fire durations, fire loads, structural elements) another study revealed that the steel temperatures didn&#39;t even reach 400 ºF. Not only that, but they went as far as simulating the two entire floors completely burning up and even then steel temperatures were below 570 ºF which resulted in an insignificant thermal expansion, which as consequence <em>could not</em> cause the fatal displacement of the support.</p>

<p>As of now NIST&#39;s results have been scientifically proven to be incorrect, and because the thermal expansion was not enough to cause fatal displacement their claim is also untrue.</p>

<p>On top of that, a top forensic structural engineer (which also arrived at the same results as above) has stated a huge problem with NIST&#39;s model simulation: <a href="https://youtu.be/_7IVCSpalbA?t=1224">https://youtu.be/_7IVCSpalbA?t=1224</a></p>

<p>While it would be <del>pusing</del> pushing a bit much (but not totally unacceptable provided with valid reasons) to model the girder and the surrounding structure differently from the rest of the building, it is absolutely wrong in every sense of the word to conduct a <strong>full building</strong> simulation with <strong>partial structure modifications</strong>. What this means is that NIST simulated their model with the far left section of the building having <strong>different properties</strong> than the rest of the building. The resulting simulation is derived from a completely incorrect build model that does not represent anything realistically valid.</p>

<p>Hope I didn&#39;t drag this too much.</p>

<p>Exactly. The debunkers haven&#39;t even paid attention to what is going on and they have already started claiming that <em>if</em> he is right about what he says doesn&#39;t mean anything because the collapse initiated somehwere else.</p>

<p>The researchers were already expecting them to move goalposts when they started their research and their next step is to study all possible cases in which fire could be constructed as a trigger of the collapse. At the end, if their results are negative, the debunkers will not have any straw left to grab inside the scenario of fire induced collapse. They will try to discredit the <del>reseach</del> research and claim that everything is wrong, but by then they will be arguing words against data.</p>

<p>Data brought up by a respectable forensic structural engineer which will not be ignored.</p>

<p>Data that is not being withheld because it might jeopardize public safety.</p>

<p>It is far easier for them to see because they did not felt the terror like americans did, a shock as terrorizing as that one will shape most people to their core. It does not matter their train of thought after that, comfort was found on the official version of events, the hate towards an enemy gave a purpose and most became completely closed to any sort of discussion that might contradict the official version of events.</p>

<p>David Chandler was <a href="https://youtu.be/AALp7S8BjDA?t=5470">mocked, insulted, threatened, harassed and marginalized</a> when he spoke out proving that WTC7 reached free-fall acceleration. He never gave up and neither did another engineer (IIRC). Eventually NIST could not continue avoiding the obvious fact when it was brought up during their live QA and they finally admitted to free-fall acceleration, even though they kept their fictitious starting time which they still to this date. No one apologized for what they did when he was trying to explain them the errors in NIST&#39;s report.</p>

<p>This is a very hard process, but little by little, through the years, more and more people are listening and seeing the official story for what it really is: a hole filled with problems.</p>

<p>How is that relevant with the subject of this post? Even the reply chain is related to refute the two linked papers:</p>

<p>&quot;<em>Not a single debunker has even bothered to try refute these two peer reviewed published scientific papers.</em>&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;<em>What&#39;s in it for them? Would it make a difference?</em>&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;<em>Where are your critics of the two peer reviewed published papers?</em>&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;<em>Would it make a difference?</em>&quot;</p>

<p>There&#39;s nothing in there related to conspiracies, who committed the attacks or anything beyond the study focused on WTC7 fires, its collapse and the claim made by NIST.</p>

<p>Did you actually bothered to read what was in that article you just linked? Do you even understand to which &quot;magazine&quot; they are even &quot;debunking&quot;?</p>

<p>Perhaps you should pay more attention:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>This is the <strong>magazine</strong> that the article is discussing: <a href="http://www.europhysicsnews.org/articles/epn/pdf/2016/04/epn2016-47-4.pdf">http://www.europhysicsnews.org/articles/epn/pdf/2016/04/epn2016-47-4.pdf</a></p></li>
<li><p>These are the <strong>papers</strong> being discussed in this entire thread, it is literally the first two links in OP thread: <a href="http://www.challengejournal.com/index.php/cjsmec/article/view/36/19">http://www.challengejournal.com/index.php/cjsmec/article/view/36/19</a> and <a href="http://www.challengejournal.com/index.php/cjsmec/article/view/50/41">http://www.challengejournal.com/index.php/cjsmec/article/view/50/41</a></p></li>
</ul>

<p>You didn&#39;t even bothered to read anything, you just googled &quot;debunked 9/11 inside job&quot;, slammed here and went with it. And I am already ignoring the lot of logical fallacies (mixed with continuous attempts at discrediting the authors of the magazine instead of their arguments) the linked article contains when attempting to refute the magazine.</p>

<p>At this point you can no longer be taken seriously.</p>

<p>(...)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In other words, <strong>when faced with a high-stress event such as 9/11, people embrace beliefs, perhaps religious or perhaps simply a <del>conspiracy</del> fabricated government story</strong>, as an attempt to explain it, and so gain some degree of control over the emotional trauma. Because it is embraced at an emotional level, any debunking of the idea will be ineffective.</p>

<p>We can’t tell people what is and is not actually true, <strong>but if we equip them with richer set of cognitive tools</strong>, then there is a good probability that they will be able to rise to the challenge of this new age of myth-information and work out what is really true.</p>

<p>I only changed one word and it fits the description of debunkers perfectly. Best of all is that it fits debunkers even better because at least the &quot;truthers&quot; make use of the scientific method, while debunkers only stop at the &quot;congitive tools&quot;.</p>

<p>So you even confirm that you didn&#39;t bothered to read anything at all related to the subject of the conversation you decided to participate. On top of that you commit the association fallacy because for you, if someone doesn&#39;t seem like a reliable sort to you then everything else associated to that person becomes irrelevant, or in the case of this discussion, refuted.</p>

<p>That&#39;s what I meant in my reply: &quot;<em>And I am already ignoring the lot of logical fallacies (mixed with continuous attempts at discrediting the authors of the magazine instead of their arguments) the linked article contains when attempting to refute the magazine.</em>&quot;</p>

<p>The blog creates a global context in which they ridicule &quot;truthers&quot;, associate it with the men from those magazines, calls all the points wrong based on those preconceptions and even goes as far as making rebutals with nothing corroborating.</p>

<p>It&#39;s like watching someone saying that the building had air, the building collapsed, therefor the building collapsed because of the air. Evidence? Corroboration? Anything supporting their claim?</p>

<p>And then they link to <a href="http://screwloosechange.blogspot.pt/2016/08/jones-co-beclown-european-physics-news.html">another blog</a> which they claim to have debunked it, and that blog too commits the same errors when debunking.</p>

<p>It was hard to read it, but I did read it and I wish I won&#39;t have to talk about it ever again. It is just too ignorant of basic rebutal concepts. Make a claim? Provide corroboration. No corroboration? Then don&#39;t make the claim. Simple.</p>

<p>Fortunately there are some people that actually debunk correctly, sadly most of the blogs are of the wrong kind of debunking. It is inevitable: the world is filled with more ignorants than educated people, and I include both truthers and debunkers here.</p>

<p>It really is a pathetic mindset. &quot;If anyone disagrees with the official story (even qualified professionals) then they are truthers. And if you are a truther, anything thing you say/do/research you produce is invalid. So therefore, there are no rebuttals to the official story!&quot; </p>

<p>Much like the moronic mindset of the faithers:</p>

<p>Person 1: &quot;So many first responders and workers at Ground Zero reported seeing molten steel beams. But how can that be if the official story fires aren&#39;t hot enough?&quot; </p>

<p>Person 2: &quot;Jet fuel can&#39;t melt steel beams??!!1111 It didn&#39;t have to! The steel only needed to be weakened!15833412&quot;</p>

<p>Person 1: &quot;That&#39;s not what I said. And NIST even states “No conclusive evidence was found to indicate that pre-collapse fires were sever enough to have a significant effect on the microstructure that would have resulted in weakening of the steel structure.” NIST NCSTAR 1-3C, p. 235</p>

<p>Person 2: &quot;Steel fuel can&#39;t melt jet beamz lolz!&quot;</p>

<p>Person 1: &quot;yea..nevermind&quot;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Given that high burn rates do not generally last longer than about 30 minutes and that fires in office buildings do not occur over entire floors simultaneously, Korol says that the assumption of having the entire area of the 12th and 13th floors ablaze was “a ridiculously conservative estimate for the purposes of determining the consequences to the building.” Even then, the researchers showed the temperatures to be insufficient to push a girder off its seat near Column 79, thus disproving NIST’s claim that such a failure mechanism initiated the collapse of the building.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So they say that because high burn rates don&#39;t last more than a half hour and that the entire floors of 12 and 13 couldn&#39;t have been on fire that the building couldn&#39;t have collapsed from fire?</p>

<p>I mean, sure, if you focus your test on 30 minutes and two floors, of course the building will survive. Now, try more than two floors on fire for 7 hours. Perhaps not high burn rates, but by that time the building has become an oven. </p>

<p>Their tests covered the same parameters NIST covered in their publications, and even further as well. NIST and video/photo evidence clearly show that there were no fires persisting at any given location for more than 30mins (location, not floor). There were no fires at any place in that entire building that covered an entire floor, let alone fires that had a duration of 7 hours. Stick to the research, just because the building could be a oven (even though the steel frame would dissipate the heat preventing this, something that has already been researched) doesn&#39;t mean the entire building would demolish itself completely.</p>

<p>Can you imagine how many buildings would be destroyed during summer if that were true?</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>No. They used the conservative extremes that NIST used as well and found that it wasn&#39;t enough to trigger a collapse. They also added that they even went as far as considering the entire 2 floors (12 and 13) completely burning and even then it was not enough to cause trigger the collapse.</p>

<p>They not only covered NIST&#39;s parameters, they went as far as going to extreme scenarios. Neither were enough to cause the collapse. And that isn&#39;t even the problem here. The real problem is confirming that even an unrealistic scenario would not be enough to trigger the collapse, then how could NIST assertain that the lowest case scenario (in comparison to the extreme) was more than enough to trigger the collapse.</p>

<p>And along with the above conclusions and with NIST refusing to release the 80% data they used for their model simulation which they claim to prove their claims, the only logical explanation is that they dry-labbed.</p>

<p>Because those floors were the ones NIST claimed to have been the main focus for the collapse initiation (office fires, thermal expansion, support walk-off). Any other fire at that time was either already extinct or too weak to be considered.</p>

<p>NIST did cover how many floors had office fires, there weren&#39;t just 2 floors. Go to slide 29: <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/bootz15/nist-wtc-7-technical-briefing-082608">http://www.slideshare.net/bootz15/nist-wtc-7-technical-briefing-082608</a></p>

<p>There were at least 7 floors with office fires (some very small, a few large, others that appeared to be big but just moved from one side to another). But all of that doesn&#39;t mean anything if their claim was proved to be incorrect.</p>

<p>Office fires are not enough to collapse a building such as WTC7, it never has before or after 9/11: <a href="http://911research.wtc7.net/wtc/analysis/compare/fires.html">http://911research.wtc7.net/wtc/analysis/compare/fires.html</a></p>

<p>Did you even read the NIST report?

<blockquote>

<p>The research documents in this post and this discussion have already literally showed that even if the fires were unrealistic (covering two entire floors at the same time instead of a few pockets of fire that moved from one fuel source to another) the building would not collapse. I even took the trouble of pointing out the obvious of this all for you to understand and you still circle around to the same argument: &quot;They not only covered NIST&#39;s parameters, <strong>they went as far as going to extreme scenarios.

<p>You didn&#39;t even bothered to research the fires I linked to see whether or not &quot;nearly all those buildings&quot; had a concrete core structure, you just outright ignored them:</p>

<p>One Meridian Plaza: No concrete core</p>

<p>First Interstate Bank: No concrete core</p>

<p>1 New York Plaza: No concrete core</p>

<p>Caracas Tower: No concrete core</p>

<p>Windsor Building: Concrete core - suffered partial collapse</p>

<p>Beijing Mandarin Oriental Hotel: No concrete core</p>

<p>And not only did you ignore them but you also ignore the fact that even if &quot;only a few&quot; office fires happened on buildings similar to WTC7 they also did not collapse completely, not one of them.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>How is that different from anything that has been said in this entire conversation? Has there been any point in which it was said that NITS&#39;s claims did not depend on fires, which is literally their claim? </p>

<p>At this point it has become very clear that you are not interested in anything related to this subject, but to circle around the same arguments, ignoring information that is provided and keep insisting on a detail that you decided to be the most important thing without ever providing any valid scientific reason/corroboration.</p>

<p>What you are doing right now is not being a devils advocate, you are behaving like someone that just wants to waste other people&#39;s time, and I have no intentions on continuing with this charade.</p>

<p>The researches are publicly available, both the ones linked in OP and NIST&#39;s. The focus here is not the fires, how they acted or how many you think would be enough to transform a building into an oven, but the fact that the fires, even unrealisticly extreme fires, could not cause the collapse of WTC7.</p>

<p>If you still don&#39;t understand something as simple and obvious as this then stay well and have a nice day.</p>

<p>You seem to misunderstand the point I&#39;m trying to make. Their response is that they took NIST&#39;s data and went even further and the building didn&#39;t collapse.</p>

<p>I&#39;m asking whether or not they&#39;re interpreting what NIST reported properly, not whether or not they agree with it. Considering that it&#39;s stated that something around 80% of the data on the simulation for WTC7 is not available, how can they reliably interpret and/or replicate NIST&#39;s tests?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>One Meridian Plaza</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_Meridian_Plaza">Wiki page</a>. The fire was being combated against by firefighters and sprinkler systems were active in the building. The fire <em>did</em> cause damage to the steel structure, but it&#39;s design was able to withstand the stress.  </p>

<p>WTC7 didn&#39;t have firefighters paying attention to it, nor did it have sprinklers due to damage to the water main from the collapse of the towers.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>First Interstate Bank</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Interstate_Tower_fire">&quot;Unusually good fireproofing&quot;</a>. Something WTC7 didn&#39;t have. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>1 New York Plaza</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1_New_York_Plaza">Wiki Page</a>. Fire is barely a footnote, which leads me to believe it wasn&#39;t even remotely as dangerous as examples like the Meridian or FIB. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Caracas Tower</p>
</blockquote>

<p>From the Wiki:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The fire affected regions from the 34th floor to the 50th floor. The tower sustained major damage because firefighting efforts were hampered by non-working automatic sprinkler and standpipe systems. <em>It was feared that the</em> <strong>concrete</strong> <em>-and-steel structure could be damaged severely enough to collapse</em>, and internal firefighting efforts were pulled in the interest of safety. Two steel decks partially collapsed, and deflection in some steel beams was later found to be severe. The fire burned itself out in the early morning of October 19.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Concrete was part of the structure and even then there was fears of it collapsing, and from a structural standpoint, it nearly did.  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Windsor</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windsor_Tower_(Madrid">Here&#39;s an image form the wiki page</a>#/media/File:TorreWindsor1.JPG). The steel has melted out of the building and the concrete structure remains. This one supports my point that concrete in the support structure is much more resilient to fire. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>And not only did you ignore them but you also ignore the fact that even if &quot;only a few&quot; office fires happened on buildings similar to WTC7 they also did not collapse completely, not one of them.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The problem is not many buildings are similar to WTC7 except the other WTC buildings, as they all shared very similar architectural and structural design. Two of those did collapse, and WTC5 partially collapsed <em>from fire</em>.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>How is that different from anything that has been said in this entire conversation?</p>

</blockquote>

<p>You&#39;re saying that fires on the other floors didn&#39;t matter because NIST&#39;s explanation of the collapse was incorrect. In a steel building, fire anywhere matters. Unless you meant something else by this?</p>

<p>Which is possibly not true, because of the sheer lack of data on the part of anyone outside of NIST. Not to mention the multiple examples we have of steel structures failing under fire. WTC5 also failed partially from fire. WTC1&amp;2 failed from fire. </p>

<p>Ultimately if it helps at all, I believe the WTC buildings in general were cheaply built. Focusing on Steel to support the near entirety of the structures. In the case of 1&amp;2, the fireproofing material was destroyed by the impacts, and in the case of WTC7, the sprinkler system could not function. WTC5 had a fire and had it&#39;s sprinkler system intact as far as I can tell. </p>

<p>One of the buildings you provided is an example, Windsor. In the images it&#39;s clear to see that the steel structure failed while the concrete held, which kept the building from collapsing completely.</p>

<p>The commonly held explanation is that the impact knocked off and/or damage the fire proofing material that surrounded the steel structure of the towers.

    <div class="md"><p>There is no controversy about the amount of fuel in these buildings. The science has been done, cross-checked, printed and distributed. There simply was not enough fuel in any of these buildings to cause the kind of collapses we all saw. No amount of bluster or incredulity will change that. As gayunicorn pointed out, you&#39;re not here to have an actual debate, but to do some kind of damage control to the official conspiracy theory. That&#39;s fine. It&#39;s your right. But you&#39;re not making a real argument, nor are you taking into account all the evidence available.</p>

<p>If you want to make a good theory about what happened, and it involves office fires alone as the culprit, then how do you explain all the other evidence of extremely high temperature by-products? Do you dismiss them as &quot;insignificant&quot; or &quot;not real&quot;? What do you make of the surface temperatures that exceeded 1000C for several weeks after the collapses? Office fires don&#39;t do that. Do you just ignore that fact? That&#39;s what I would do if I was trying to sell a bill of goods.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Feel free to tuck tail and run, but it&#39;s not because I&#39;m not open to another argument, it&#39;s that your logic is weak. And I see how and why it&#39;s weak. I&#39;ll entertain this conversation until the internet shuts down. It&#39;s makes not a wit of difference to me what you do next.</p>

<p>As for the surface temps exceeding 1000C for several weeks after the collapses, there are certainly no other instances of this that I&#39;m aware of. Regardless of the circumstances of fires &quot;allowed to burn unchecked for hours,&quot; a fire still needs fuel and air. The problem with this information, from the perspective of the official conspiracy theory is that you only get 1000C in ideal situations: i.e., ideal air supply, flow and fuel. Is that your understanding of the rubble pile? Do you actually believe the conditions in the pile were <em>better</em> than the open structure at 500+ feet?</p>

<p>Of course they weren&#39;t. And that&#39;s far from the only evidence of extreme temperatures you must incorporate into your &quot;office fire induced collapse&quot; theory. Some of the others include:</p>

<ul>
<li>molten steel</li>
<li>molten molybdenum</li>
<li>vaporized lead</li>
<li>molten rock wool</li>
<li>more than 5% iron microspheres in the dust by weight</li>
</ul>

<p>Office fires simply cannot account for these known phenomena. In order to face reality, one must make a theory that explains the evidence. Not make the evidence fit the theory, which it seems you&#39;re trying to do.</p>

<p>I can name a similar situation where temperatures heat up that much: Ovens. </p>

<p>When you have a bunch of concrete sitting atop still burning material which burns slowly but for long periods of time due to airflow being blocked by debris, you certainly can get the temperature that high. </p>

<p>For perspective though, can I get citation on the 1000C figure? I want to be sure we&#39;re not confusing it with 1000F.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>For a long slow burn? Yes. As for the temperature reaching 1000C, unlikely. 1000F, highly probable.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Depends on the materials burned. When they simulate office fires they always throw in carpet, chairs, furniture, etc. Essentially what you&#39;d expect in a newly furnished office. They rarely ever account for materials that the employees bring in of their own accord, some of which can be highly flammable and/or burn for a very long time. </p>

<p>Do we have citation on how many styrofoam cups they burned? How about Polaroids? Computers? Laptop batteries? CDs? Books? Filing cabinets full of paper and folders? Plants? <em>Fake</em> plants? I mean check, rubber can burn for a damn long time. </p>

<p>700C? Maybe a smelting oven. Not one for food. And strangely, according to the official conspiracy theory, ovens, made of thin gauge steel, don&#39;t melt! </p>

<blockquote>
<p>When you have a bunch of concrete sitting atop still burning material which burns slowly but for long periods of time due to airflow being blocked by debris, <strong>you certainly can get the temperature that high.</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>No you cannot. Not even close. Ever sat around a campfire and watched it burn out, despite the abundance of open air? Now, what happens when you shovel some dirt onto the pit? Does it get <em>hotter</em>? No. It goes out. That&#39;s because it needs oxygen it&#39;s not getting from being smothered under dirt. Hence the term &quot;smothering a fire.&quot; </p>

<p>That&#39;s the primary problem with the surface temp data: It&#39;s the opposite of what we should expect from the official fuel sources. There isn&#39;t anything in the official documentation to explain why a smothered fire would maintain or get hotter than an open air fire with the same fuel. </p>

<p><a href="http://pubs.usgs.gov/of/2001/ofr-01-0429/thermal.r09.html">Here&#39;s the NASA AVIRIS data</a></p>

<p>But, of course, you&#39;ve seen this already. To be fair, you&#39;re right about the temperature scale: It&#39;s not 1000C, it&#39;s more like 1000K or 1341F or 727C. However, that doesn&#39;t fix the thermodynamic gap that the official theory must overcome in order to make any sense whatsoever.</p>

<p>In the UL burn tests, contracted by NIST, the hottest temps were about 1000C for about 10 minutes. They burned out, as expected, within a few hours at most. The AVIRIS data show <em>surface</em> temps in excess of 600C <em>for weeks</em>. </p>

<p>And that&#39;s just one body of evidence for extremely high-temperature anomalies that the official theory cannot account for. The best you can hope for is to try to ignore this data or make it seem like it&#39;s normal, or just throw your hands up and say &quot;well, can you prove it doesn&#39;t do that in other fires?&quot; Which are all attempts to ignore or sully the significance of this body of evidence. </p>

<p>Then you have to do the same thing with:</p>

<ul>
<li>molten steel</li>
<li>molten molybdenum</li>
<li>vaporized lead</li>
<li>molten rock wool</li>
<li>more than 5% iron microspheres in the WTC dust by weight</li>
<li>hot surface corrosion attacked steel </li>
</ul>

<p>At a certain point, you have to stop believing you can epicycle your way out and actually revise your theory. A theory is not something to be protected. It should be thrown to the wolves to see if it can survive.</p>

<p>Oh, looks like you didn&#39;t ignore it... then why did you feel the need to say it&#39;s not possible with the wrong context and then immediately address the proper context?</p>

<p>You&#39;re implying that 400C less in temperature is not sustainable compared to 1000C for <em>hours</em>? Really? It takes far less material to maintain that 600C than it does 1000C, <em>especially</em> when the debris acts as an oxygen choke, possibly allowing fires like that to burn for much <em>much</em> longer, maintaining the lower temperature.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not saying this is the case but this is absolutely wihtin the realm of possibility and is the basis of the design of material burning ovens/furnaces/etc. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Then you have to do the same thing with:</p>

<p>I don&#39;t have anything to address that. I&#39;m not trying to address that. I&#39;m not saying NIST is correct. I <em>am</em> saying that those who are challenging NIST seem to be doing a poor job at it in my opinion. How many different ways do I need to try and explain this to you?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The NIST theory is a poor one. It ignores a huge amount of the forensic evidence, eye witness accounts, spectroscopic analysis, etc. in favor of an untestable, arm-chair hypothesis. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>It takes far less material to maintain that 600C than it does 1000C...</p>
</blockquote>

<p>All of the temperature analyses that NIST produced showed that the hottest any piece of steel they analyzed got was about 250C for about 15 minutes at most. To see temps of 700-600C sustained under megatons of debris, without ventilation, doused with millions of gallons of water just doesn&#39;t make sense with the known fuel sources.</p>

<p>The reason this is significant is that there&#39;s no faking a thermodynamic gap. Paper, plastic, wood and other hydrocarbon fuel sources simply cannot bridge the thermodynamic chasm that the evidence of extremely high temperatures betrays. There&#39;s no getting around physics. </p>

<p>In order to make sense of the evidence, there must be another fuel source. Period. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>NIST hired UL to perform burn tests. They built offices and loaded them with the same materials that were in these buildings. In some of the tests, the materials were mashed together to simulate areas in which the planes disrupted the material distribution. They sprayed fuel over these faux office spaces and recorded the caloric output. </p>

<p>The &quot;trashed&quot; offices were the hottest fires. The hottest they got for the longest was about 1100C for roughly 10 minutes.</p>

<p>The big takeaways from these tests are that:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>There wasn&#39;t enough time for fires to get hot enough for long enough to cause the steel to fail in any catastrophic way.</p></li>
<li><p>It didn&#39;t matter whether the materials were paper, wood or plastic, they all produced the same results.</p></li>

    <div class="md"><p>So TL;DR the first paper is trying to assert that there is no possible way the structural member NIST determined to have failed with their computer model could not have heated sufficiently in the time estimated based on the estimated fuel load.</p>

<p>The first paper assumes the fuel load, assumes that only heat or fuel from a normal office environment, and that the fire insulation was completely intact (on a building that was damaged when a skyscraper fell on it) and worked as designed.</p>

<p>Of course part of the NIST findings were that the insulation on the floor panels was not performing as expected (not just in computer simulations but in actual physical test). Also the fires in the building burned considerably longer then 25 minutes (the whole building did burn for 7 hours).</p>

<p>Neat paper. Let people know when you actually have evidence that supports your claims of a controlled demolition.</p>

<pre><code>                              Conclusions
</code></pre>

<p>Our objective at the beginning of the study was to simply investigate whether there was enough energy dissipative capacity in the 47 storey WTC 7 high rise
steel frame structure to offset its gravitational potential energy for the case of an extreme fire loading event. </p>

<p>As noted by NIST in their NCSTAR 1-9 report, very hot fires are claimed to have been present in the 12 th and 13 th floors for several hours during the late morning and afternoon of 9/11 sufficient in fact to cause the total collapse of the building.</p>

<p>The authors decided to revisit the problem to ascertain for ourselves whether the structure’s demise could have happened under conditions of two storeys being substantially weakened by the heat.</p>

<p><strong>Regarding our focus on gravitational potential energy versus the dissipative energy possessed by the structure, we found that the former was insufficient to cause a total collapse scenario to occur by a factor of 4.</strong></p>

<p>The question then morphed into a more detailed analysis whereby we
wanted to know the extent of a partial collapse. Indeed, our assumptions and analysis <strong>based on Newtonian mechanics clearly show that a very limited partial collapse would have been possible but that it would have been restricted to the storeys in which the fires occurred and to the one below.</strong> </p>

<p>Some might argue that an upper storey would have been more vulnerable, however, the column sizes involved were so little different, we decided to
adopt the Bazant hypothesis that crush-down would take precedence over crush-up. As noted, our progressive collapse investigation involved a storey-by-storey analysis that was initiated with Block A, the base of
which was presumed to be the 14th floor. It was presumed that a crush-down descent would begin with the equivalent of only 27 columns capable of resisting the
column and service loadings that the design engineering firm, Irwin Castor, prescribed in their loading schedule for dead and live loads. This number was based on the design possessing an overall factor of safety of 3, a not unreasonable factor that is consistent with building code standards in general. </p>

<p>As well, we treated perimeter and core columns as being equally loaded across floor areas that were vulnerable, since WTC 7 is known to have
come straight down as observed by video cameras.</p>

<p>Sounds like, despite what ReallyBigDeal says (useless opinion indeed), that the authors do make very specific claims. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was just supporting the earlier remark made by someone about the journals lack of renown, and explained why such a thing can be a problem. The intent of me was less to call the paper into doubt, but more to point out that such is indeed seen as a demerit to some.</p>

<p>And since I (nor most likely you) do not have education in civil engineering, I am not fully equipped to properly review and criticise the merits of this paper. That is why there&#39;s peer review, so that the peers with proper education can review it before it is published.</p>

<p>And this whole argument is that because the journal is less renowned (combined with the open access nature), there is less certainty that this process was done properly. But it is also no indication that it hasn&#39;t been properly done. It is just something to keep in mind when judging the whole thing. (or any paper really)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Your &quot;analysis&quot; of the journal as a harbinger of the quality of the paper is an artifact of your lack of critical thinking skills. One need not be a civil engineer to evaluate an argument, nor to otherwise judge the quality of logic employed in making a sequence of thoughts.</p>

<p>If I&#39;m a particle physicist, and I say &quot;the quantum foam structure relies on a 17-dimensional coconut fiber,&quot; you, not being a physicist, still have very good grounds for calling bullshit on my conclusion. That&#39;s because you don&#39;t have to be a physicist to see that sentence doesn&#39;t make any sense.</p>

<p>Likewise, if the argument and its conclusions do appear to cohere under a logical analysis, you can say, &quot;I may not be a specialist in (xyz profession), but the structure of the argument is solid.&quot; The structure of an argument is what makes it valid or invalid. Just because it&#39;s valid doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s true, but if it&#39;s invalid, it&#39;s definitely worthless, and you have every right to trash it.</p>

<p>Believe it or not, this same structure of analysis is true for any field in the world. </p>

<p>joke 1 - Calling Popular Mechanics a renowned science journal</p>

<p>joke 2 - Popular Mechanics</p>

<p>But the biggest joke is still rolling: NIST&#39;s research and the debunkers demanding for all of the data and peer-review of any paper that contradicts NIST&#39;s claims.

<p>I mean, sure, if you focus your test on 30 minutes and two floors, of course the building will survive. Now, try more than two floors on fire for 7 hours. Perhaps not high burn rates, but by that time the building has become an oven. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Their tests covered the same parameters NIST covered in their publications, and even further as well. NIST and video/photo evidence clearly show that there were no fires persisting at any given location for more than 30mins (location, not floor). There were no fires at any place in that entire building that covered an entire floor, let alone fires that had a duration of 7 hours. Stick to the research, just because the building could be a oven (even though the steel frame would dissipate the heat preventing this, something that has already been researched) doesn&#39;t mean the entire building would demolish itself completely.</p>

<p>Can you imagine how many buildings would be destroyed during summer if that were true?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>So they say that because high burn rates don&#39;t last more than a half hour and that the entire floors of 12 and 13 couldn&#39;t have been on fire that the building couldn&#39;t have collapsed from fire?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No. They used the conservative extremes that NIST used as well and found that it wasn&#39;t enough to trigger a collapse. They also added that they even went as far as considering the entire 2 floors (12 and 13) completely burning and even then it was not enough to cause trigger the collapse.</p>

<p>They not only covered NIST&#39;s parameters, they went as far as going to extreme scenarios. Neither were enough to cause the collapse. And that isn&#39;t even the problem here. The real problem is confirming that even an unrealistic scenario would not be enough to trigger the collapse, then how could NIST assertain that the lowest case scenario (in comparison to the extreme) was more than enough to trigger the collapse.</p>

<p>And along with the above conclusions and with NIST refusing to release the 80% data they used for their model simulation which they claim to prove their claims, the only logical explanation is that they dry-labbed.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>NIST hired UL to perform burn tests. They built offices and loaded them with the same materials that were in these buildings. In some of the tests, the materials were mashed together to simulate areas in which the planes disrupted the material distribution. They sprayed fuel over these faux office spaces and recorded the caloric output. </p>

<p>The &quot;trashed&quot; offices were the hottest fires. The hottest they got for the longest was about 1100C for roughly 10 minutes.</p>

<p>The big takeaways from these tests are that:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>There wasn&#39;t enough time for fires to get hot enough for long enough to cause the steel to fail in any catastrophic way.</p></li>
<li><p>It didn&#39;t matter whether the materials were paper, wood or plastic, they all produced the same results.</p></li>

<p>Depends on the materials burned. When they simulate office fires they always throw in carpet, chairs, furniture, etc. Essentially what you&#39;d expect in a newly furnished office.

<p>Do we have citation on how many styrofoam cups they burned? How about Polaroids? Computers? Laptop batteries? CDs? Books? Filing cabinets full of paper and folders? Plants? <em>Fake</em> plants? I mean check, rubber can burn for a damn long time. </p>
