<p>Yes, we should be watchful of the future and not always looking back, but it is by studying the past that we can remain informed of efforts to mislead our attentions.</p>

<p>AFAIK:  The Trump administration&#39;s focus on opposing drugs is more about opposing deep state mechanisms which use drug trafficking to subvert or avoid democratically-controlled appropriations procedures.  It isn&#39;t about suppressing pot.  Statements by the AG have indicated that state and local laws will determine enforcement priorities.</p>

<p>Do some reading up on the relationship between Tom Price, Trump&#39;s appointee to secretary of health and human services and McKesson.</p>

<p>Why do profits have to boom? It&#39;s already fucked up what they&#39;re doing <strong>now</strong> (regardless of who has been in power), so it seems like you&#39;re ok with the status quo so long as your guy is the one doing it?

<p>All he has to do is leave legal weed alone and the problem will begin to resolve itself. I don&#39;t know enough about the pharma scam to see any easy, legal, ways out of there price gouging. I feel that any price controls by the government would be hard to enact.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ok, I&#39;ll bite.</p>

<p>While not as much as Clinton, <a href="https://www.opensecrets.org/industries/recips.php?ind=H04&amp;amp;cycle=2016&amp;amp;recipdetail=P&amp;amp;mem=N&amp;amp;sortorder=U">he did receive some money from the pharmaceutical industry</a>.</p>

<p>Also, <a href="http://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/1/31/14453740/trump-medicare-prescription-drugs">this happened</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This event with PhRMA lobbyists explains why. On most of the big public policy issues of the day, Trump is a very conventional Republican. And on those issues where he hasn’t been conventional, Republican Congress members and business executives feel confident they can turn him around. On some issues, they probably won’t. But on this issue, it seems like they did.</p>

<p>I should acknowledge that some reporters who cover this beat don’t agree with my read of these remarks. But Trump <a href="http://talkingpointsmemo.com/livewire/tom-price-medicare-drug-price-negotiations">picked an HHS Secretary who’s opposed price negotiations</a>, and other ideologically orthodox Republicans to run Medicare and Medicaid and his Office of Management and Budget. When congressional Democrats tried to get an amendment supporting price negotiation into the senate’s budget resolution, Trump didn’t lift a finger to stop them. It seems to me that Trump is now aligning his statements with the actual policy he is pursuing, namely to speed drug approvals at the FDA and not change anything about Medicare pricing. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s a stupid thing to hope for.  Big pharma spends hundreds of millions on R&amp;D, clinal stuidies, and marketing.  By slashing prices all your going to do is stop them from developing new drugs, because it won&#39;t be worth it to them to do the investment.  Instead encourage legislation to help generic drug makers and stop authorized generics (big drug makers screw with generic drug companies by partnering with another company, then they come out with an authorized generic, so the original company loses less money from generics).</p>

A company has to get a return on their investment.  Cut regulations to make them more common sense, and drug prices will fall dramatically.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ok, I&#39;ll bite.</p>

<p>While not as much as Clinton, <a href="https://www.opensecrets.org/industries/recips.php?ind=H04&amp;amp;cycle=2016&amp;amp;recipdetail=P&amp;amp;mem=N&amp;amp;sortorder=U">he did receive some money from the pharmaceutical industry</a>.</p>

<p>Also, <a href="http://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/1/31/14453740/trump-medicare-prescription-drugs">this happened</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This event with PhRMA lobbyists explains why. On most of the big public policy issues of the day, Trump is a very conventional Republican. And on those issues where he hasn’t been conventional, Republican Congress members and business executives feel confident they can turn him around. On some issues, they probably won’t. But on this issue, it seems like they did.</p>

<p>I should acknowledge that some reporters who cover this beat don’t agree with my read of these remarks. But Trump <a href="http://talkingpointsmemo.com/livewire/tom-price-medicare-drug-price-negotiations">picked an HHS Secretary who’s opposed price negotiations</a>, and other ideologically orthodox Republicans to run Medicare and Medicaid and his Office of Management and Budget. When congressional Democrats tried to get an amendment supporting price negotiation into the senate’s budget resolution, Trump didn’t lift a finger to stop them. It seems to me that Trump is now aligning his statements with the actual policy he is pursuing, namely to speed drug approvals at the FDA and not change anything about Medicare pricing. </p>
