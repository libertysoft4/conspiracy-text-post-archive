    <div class="md"><p>A large amount of other people around the world who do ADVANCED LUCID DREAMING and ASTRAL PROJECTION have the ability to visit other dimensions. The Astral Dimension is where people go after the die. Numerous living people around the world have the ability to visit this dimension. It is similar to here, and has houses, bars, roads and at least one ENORMOUS MALL. People who are still alive and can visit this mall. To keep it simple they call it &quot;MALL WORLD&quot;.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I just dreamt about a mall and in that mall there was a talent show. A family walks into the talent show. It&#39;s a father, mother, son, daughter and dog. The father says to the talent agent, &quot;We have a really amazing act. You should represent us.&quot;</p>

<p>The agent says, &quot;Sorry, I don&#39;t represent family acts. They&#39;re a little too cute.&quot;</p>

<p>The mother says, &quot;Sir, if you just see our act, we know you would want to represent us.&quot;</p>

<p>The agent says, &quot;OK. OK. I&#39;ll take a look.&quot;</p>

<p>Immediately the father removes his clothing revealing a massive penis fully erect. The daughter goes over and places his balls in her mouth as the massive cock continues to grow. The mother removes her clothing and the son begins to suck on her pussy. She moves over toward father, who is cock slapping the daughter so hard she has a bloody nose, and brings out a large funnel.
The tip is about a half an inch in diameter and the shaft about 8 inches long. While the daughter eats the balls, Mom shoves the funnel into dad&#39;s cock hole. She then backs up toward it while the son continues to munch on her twat. She squats over the funnel and releases a huge torrent of diarrhea.
As she fills the funnel, dad&#39;s balls begin to swell, soon the size of large coconuts. Mom yanks out the funnel and shoves it down the son&#39;s equally impressive member. Once again she sends a river of runny shit into the funnel swelling the son&#39;s nuts to the size of casaba melons.
Once done She starts furiously sucking on the son&#39;s cock while the daughter does the same to dad. The both suck hard, deep and fast until both cocks spew forth a tremendous fountain of come and diarrhea. Mom and sis take the massive loads in the mouth slurping down almost every vile drop. What they don&#39;t eat the faithful dog does, licking the floor clean. As the father and son finally finish there horrific display, mom and daughter stand up and wipe their mouths and reveal twin shit eating grins, They all in unison look at the agent and say, &quot;Taa Daaa!&quot;</p>

<p>For the longest time, the agent just sits in silence. Finally, he manages, &quot;That&#39;s a hell of an act. What do you call it?&quot;</p>

<p>And the father says, &quot;The Aristocrats!&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ok. Therefore you must read Robert Monroes 3 self written books as well as his autobiography. Get Buhlmans book also. Sylvan Muldoon wrote of his experiences long ago. All these books can be bought used very cheaply. There is much that can be learned as well some of the wildest experiences you will ever read. Monroe did work very similar to myself in which he would go deep into the afterlife. His books are a must read for anyone with an awakened mind : )</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What worked for me was meditating everyday for like 6 months and 6 hours a day with a lot of weed, using divination methods like I Ching and what you read/think of before you sleep is very important. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t think I&#39;ll ever be able to do it again as they torture me with advanced tech whenever I meditate or between sleep/wake state when I want to astral project :( </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was going to laugh at this because of the name... but I&#39;ve actually had many dreams in this kind of future-mall-theme park environment. Very interesting.</p>

<p>Many times these dreams are encoded to hide the true location that our astral-dream body travels to... but it is interesting to imagine that there is a dream space that we could share through the collective consciousness, that is more or less like a &#39;mall&#39;.</p>

<p>I think there is something to this.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve definitely projected before, but do not remember a mall world.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Interesting, I&#39;ve astral projected before and had this mall dream twice, it always stuck out to me, my friend also has strange dreams and she had the mall dream once too. Another common dream we had when we were a lot younger was that we were lucid and had big angel like wings and started to fly over a city and everyone in the city turned against us and were trying to shoot us down with tanks and everything then we woke up. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hi. It is actually a very common experience. Many people around the world agree that MALL WORLD is real. If this subject was seen by most of the population instead of a small sample, my guess is an extremely large amount of people worldwide actually go there. It is also very common for the Astral Inhabitants to be hostile towards the living visitors. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yea, AP sounds so interesting. I recently heard a podcast that interviewed some people who made a living as <a href="https://www.astonishinglegends.com/al-podcasts/2017/4/10/ep-68-bonus-flight-19-and-remote-viewing">remote viewers</a>. I had looked into it and have never accomplished it. I end up falling asleep. I will keep trying though! BTW I saw a lot of your post and you seem like a sister/brother soul! cheers</p>
