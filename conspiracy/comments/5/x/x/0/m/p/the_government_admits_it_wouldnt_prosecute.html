<p>In testimony in front of the Senate in March, Holder, who is now the U.S. attorney general, seemed to lament the position government enforcers had found themselves in [when deciding whether to prosecute bankers for the 2008 financial crisis]. “I am concerned that the size of some of these institutions becomes so large that it does become difficult for us to prosecute them when we are hit with indications that if we do prosecute — if we do bring a criminal charge — it will have a negative impact on the national economy, perhaps even the world economy.” - <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/05/04/magazine/only-one-top-banker-jail-financial-crisis.html">http://www.nytimes.com/2014/05/04/magazine/only-one-top-banker-jail-financial-crisis.html</a></p>

<p>(Holder returned to the law firm that he was at prior to becoming attorney general, where his client list included the banks that he declined to prosecute. <a href="http://www.rollingstone.com/politics/news/eric-holder-wall-street-double-agent-comes-in-from-the-cold-20150708">http://www.rollingstone.com/politics/news/eric-holder-wall-street-double-agent-comes-in-from-the-cold-20150708</a>)</p>

<p>To be clear, the decision of whether to indict a corporation, defer prosecution, or decline altogether is not one that I, or anyone in the Criminal Division, take lightly.  We are frequently on the receiving end of presentations from defense counsel, CEOs, and economists who argue that the collateral consequences of an indictment would be devastating for their client.  In my conference room, over the years, I have heard sober predictions that a company or bank might fail if we indict, that innocent employees could lose their jobs, that entire industries may be affected, and even that global markets will feel the effects.  Sometimes – though, let me stress, not always – these presentations are compelling.  In reaching every charging decision, we must take into account the effect of an indictment on innocent employees and shareholders, just as we must take into account the nature of the crimes committed and the pervasiveness of the misconduct.  I personally feel that it’s my duty to consider whether individual employees with no responsibility for, or knowledge of, misconduct committed by others in the same company are going to lose their livelihood if we indict the corporation.  In large multi-national companies, the jobs of tens of thousands of employees can be at stake.  And, in some cases, the health of an industry or the markets are a real factor.  Those are the kinds of considerations in white collar crime cases that literally keep me up at night, and which must play a role in responsible enforcement. - <a href="http://www.justice.gov/opa/speech/assistant-attorney-general-lanny-breuer-speaks-new-york-city-bar-association">http://www.justice.gov/opa/speech/assistant-attorney-general-lanny-breuer-speaks-new-york-city-bar-association</a></p>

<p>Criminal proceedings were brought against Wachovia, though not against any individual, but the case never came to court. In March 2010, Wachovia settled the biggest action brought under the US bank secrecy act, through the US district court in Miami. Now that the year&#39;s &quot;deferred prosecution&quot; has expired, the bank is in effect in the clear. It paid federal authorities $110m in forfeiture, for allowing transactions later proved to be connected to drug smuggling, and incurred a $50m fine for failing to monitor cash used to ship 22 tons of cocaine.</p>

<p>More shocking, and more important, the bank was sanctioned for failing to apply the proper anti-laundering strictures to the transfer of $378.4bn – a sum equivalent to one-third of Mexico&#39;s gross national product – into dollar accounts from so-called casas de cambio (CDCs) in Mexico, currency exchange houses with which the bank did business.</p>

<p>&quot;Wachovia&#39;s blatant disregard for our banking laws gave international cocaine cartels a virtual carte blanche to finance their operations,&quot; said Jeffrey Sloman, the federal prosecutor. Yet the total fine was less than 2% of the bank&#39;s $12.3bn profit for 2009. On 24 March 2010, Wells Fargo stock traded at $30.86 – up 1% on the week of the court settlement.</p>

<p>The conclusion to the case was only the tip of an iceberg, demonstrating the role of the &quot;legal&quot; banking sector in swilling hundreds of billions of dollars – the blood money from the murderous drug trade in Mexico and other places in the world – around their global operations, now bailed out by the taxpayer. - <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/apr/03/us-bank-mexico-drug-gangs">https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/apr/03/us-bank-mexico-drug-gangs</a></p>

<p>NEW YORK — British banking giant HSBC agreed to pay a record $1.92 billion settlement Tuesday after a broad investigation by U.S. federal and state authorities found the bank violated federal laws by laundering money from Mexican drug trafficking and processing banned transactions on behalf of Iran, Libya, Sudan and Burma .</p>

<p>The settlement, a combination of forfeitures and civil penalties, shows the London-headquartered financial powerhouse for years deliberately channeled hundreds of millions of dollars of the prohibited transactions through its U.S. arm.</p>

<p>&quot;HSBC is being held accountable for stunning failures of oversight — and worse — that led the bank to permit narcotics traffickers and others to launder millions of dollars through HSBC subsidiaries, and to facilitate hundreds of millions more in transactions with sanctioned countries,&quot; said U.S. Assistant Attorney General Lanny Breuer in announcing the largest settlement of its kind.</p>

<p>&quot;The record of dysfunction that prevailed at HSBC for many years was astonishing,&quot; said Breuer.</p>

<p>HSBC shares were up 0.5% to $51.82 in afternoon trading Tuesday. The shares also traded higher in London.</p>

<p>&quot;Obviously, $1.9 billion is a very large number, but it&#39;s very manageable&quot; without affecting HSBC&#39;s bottom line, said Ian Gordon, head of bank research for Investec Securities in London. &quot;It&#39;s clearly within market expectations.&quot; - <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/story/money/business/2012/12/11/hsbc-laundering-probe/1760351/">http://www.usatoday.com/story/money/business/2012/12/11/hsbc-laundering-probe/1760351/</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>All image and illusion over substance. Like the Vatican shuffling deviant priests into some other parish to wreak more harm and havoc on those parishioners until they have to move them again rather turning them into the police and having them prosecuted for their crimes because they wouldn&#39;t want anyone to lose faith in the church; or government officials, military or police officers that are guilty of sexual harassment or egregious misconduct simply transferred somewhere else in the organisation because they wouldn&#39;t want anyone to lose their faith or call any of any of those institutions into disrepute by prosecuting them, and so it goes with all kinds of so-called &quot;respectable&quot; institutions, including hospitals, orphanages, old age homes, you name it, it has victims whose known assailants were never brought to justice for fear of what it would have done to their precious reputations so they covered those crimes up, paid victims or their surviving relatives enough to keep quiet about it, and simply lied to everyone else.</p>

<p>And the truth and doing the right thing? These are the folks that will tell us that what we don&#39;t know can&#39;t hurt us while the world around us is slowly falling to pieces and we&#39;ve run out places to look where we don&#39;t see some kind of rot and corruption staring us smack in the face.</p>

<p>If they prosecuted bankers other bankers would take their place. It would have zero negative impact on daily operations at the bank. </p>
