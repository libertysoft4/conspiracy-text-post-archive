<p>The DNC emails last July proved that the DNC was colluding with the Clinton campaign to undermine Sanders&#39; candidacy. They exposed election fraud and other criminality. The later emails belonging to Podesta? Not only did they expose the fact that Podesta is a sick fuck, but it also exposed various campaign finance laws that were being broken and other evidences of corruption/criminality. Have you forgotten that Bernie Sanders was cheated last year? Have you forgotten that Podesta revealed his password was &quot;password&quot; through a grade-school level phishing attack? If so, that&#39;s your bad memory at fault, not the quality of the leaks. </p>

<p>They exposed election fraud in the 2016 Democratic primary elections. That&#39;s pretty fucking big as far as leaks go. I can&#39;t make our government put these criminals away for the crimes they&#39;ve committed, but Wikileaks still exposed those crimes. It&#39;s one thing to say &quot;these huge crimes being exposed didn&#39;t result in those criminals actually going to prison&quot;, but it&#39;s a completely different thing to say &quot;these leaks have been disappointing&quot;. The leaks have been fucking HUGE in reality, what more do you want when our corrupt government refuses to act on the crimes being exposed?</p>
