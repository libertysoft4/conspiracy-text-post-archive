    <div class="md"><p>One example: Most of my friends have no idea that the Soviet Union and China fought in WW2, let alone lost well over 15 million people each. But all of them -- and I mean <strong>all of them</strong> -- &quot;know&quot; that 6 million Jews died in Nazi Germany.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>People go to high school to be told what they learned in elementary school was bullshit. Then if they go to college they learn what they learned in high school was bullshit.</p>

<p>A good example of this in science is the notion that electrons orbit an atom but they actually just kind of vibrate with varying probability regarding their location.</p>

<p>That&#39;s just one lie you&#39;ve likely been told all your life and unless you looked into science at all, you likely have never heard of that. Another is that light travels as a photon. It also travels as a wave, and scientists have to remember and how they treat light depends on what they are working on. My opinion is that the photon generates the wave, but that&#39;s just me.(This is just conjecture on my part)</p>

<p>Some of these things are simplified because most high school students wouldn&#39;t be able to grasp the concepts without focusing on it way too much. Other things, like what&#39;s being discussed in this thread, are glossed over or left completely unmentioned on purpose.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Terrorism? You should ask the Koreans or the Chinese. Is burning the Queen of Korea alive terrorism? What about the chemical warfare committed by unit 731? Or the live vivisection of pregnant women, children and peasants? Or how about conducting frostbite experiments on innocent Chinese people, or spreading viruses which are still affecting people in 2017. Have you researched the games the Japanese played, there were competitions of who could behead the most POW&#39;s within a certain time frame. What about the 100&#39;s of thousands of people expected to die by putting boots on the ground in Japan at the time, on both sides. You&#39;re proving my point, the bombs killed less people than an invasion would have. Clearly, you have zero knowledge of what was happening at the time. </p>

<p>Odd. In elementary and middle school we were taught that around 10 million people died in Nazi Germany including 6 million jews. Its one of the reasons I balk at Holocaust deniers because Jews were NOT the only ones to die in the camps. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>A lot of people seem to care about the credentials that decorate our government workers. A lot of people also seem upset by how shit our country is right now and has been for decades. I think a reasonable person would agree that when things aren&#39;t working out, change is needed to continue or restore momentum towards the desired goal.</p>

<p>So with the established operative failures we have within our government, what is the source of the failure? Is everything wrong with our country right now merely the result of genuine accident and unavoidable misfortune? Cause and effect... There&#39;s a reason for everything that transpires, intentional and unintentional..</p>

<p>I would rather see big changes in a failing pathetic educational system rather than admittance and continued usage of said system. I truly hope others do as well. But that&#39;s not to say I am a supporter of Betsy Devos, but rather I am a supporter of outsiders entering new systems, as I see the value in what they can bring. What I know about Betsy Devos is the same as the people who support her and dislike her: I don&#39;t know her or her goals</p>
