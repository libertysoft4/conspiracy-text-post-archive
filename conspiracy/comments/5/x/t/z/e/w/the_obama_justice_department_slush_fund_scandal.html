        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Originally this was meant to be a response to a comment but I felt it deserved its own post.</p>

<p>At first I thought the slush fund thing was a non-issue and that the Justice Department was employing discretion explicitly granted by Congress, but apparently this is not the case.  The Justice Department has been systematically reducing the amount of fines during settlement on the condition that the defendant agreed to donate some or all of the penalized amount to preferred interest groups.  The Justice Department does this by exploiting a loophole in the Miscellaneous Receipts Act in a way that is a clear violation of Congress&#39;s appropriations power under the Separation of Powers doctrine.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In particular, DOJ has the power ‘‘to short circuit the Miscellaneous Receipts Act by agreeing to settlement terms that require the viola- tor of a Federal statute to undertake certain responsibilities or ac- tions that might inure to the benefit of the executive branch.’’ Thus, the Department could effectively ‘‘augment the appropria- tions of the Executive Branch without running afoul of the tech- nical requirements of the Miscellaneous Receipts Act—although creating an unconstitutional interference with Congress’ appropria- tions power.’’ (see under <a href="https://www.congress.gov/114/crpt/hrpt694/CRPT-114hrpt694.pdf">Background and the Need for Legislation</a> in the bill passed by the House in September 2016).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is a practice that Democrats have wanted the executive power to employ since the 1980s, for the purpose of funding &quot;community service projects&quot; using funds that had not been expressly appropriated by Congress.  Nor had Congress expressly granted authority to the executive branch to use its discretion in choosing how those funds were to be allocated.</p>

<p><a href="https://hensarling.house.gov/media-center/press-releases/hensarling-votes-to-stop-obama-s-settlement-slush-funds">According to Rep. Hensarling</a> (who introduced the legislation passed by the House), a Congressional investigation has revealed that the Obama Justice Department has systematically abused its settlement authority &quot;allowed&quot; under this loophole in order to funnel money to certain activist groups.  At that point the total funds amounted to $800 million, but more has been identified since then to bring the total to <a href="https://www.google.com/amp/www.foxnews.com/politics/2017/03/01/gop-wants-to-eliminate-shadowy-doj-slush-fund-bankrolling-leftist-groups.amp.html">over $3 billion.</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>In 2014, Bank of America was able to reduce a multi-billion dollar mortgage fraud penalty imposed by the DOJ by giving millions of dollars to liberal groups like National Urban League, The Neighborhood Assistance Corporation of America, and National Council of La Raza.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The scandal here is not whether this activity was expressly illegal.  To be clear, it was not.  The scandal arises from the clear partisan intention revealed by the practice of accepting fine reductions in exchange for donations to certain activist groups (whose activities the Democrats would have a political motive to support).  These deals were made at the expense of higher fine payments that would have been received by the Treasury.  These were politically-motivated settlement deals reached at the expense of the American public.</p>

<p>What a colossaly stupid argument. The executive branch is inherently partisan... therefore it can act in as partisan a way as it wants? that&#39;s not how it works, obviously. For example, the President can&#39;t order the DOJ to start targeting groups that oppose the administration, nor can it order federal procurement to stop buying from companies that donate to the other party. Likewise, diverting billions in taxpayer money from settlements to politically sympathetic groups is appalling and worthy of a banana republic, if that.</p>

<p>If the groups do legitimate work It&#39;s not how you are making it out to be</p>

<p>You keep repeating as if it&#39;s a problem. I&#39;d they do legitimate work I don&#39;t care if they are left or right leaning</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Your argument is that the DOJ can not find in the whole of the United States a single politically neutral or right-leaning qualifying charity? because the statistical likelihood of that isn&#39;t exactly stellar.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>your argument is just that they have to go through as many right leaning groups as left leaning groups? I don&#39;t see the point. </p>

<p>Setting up a charity to do &quot;legitimate work&quot; which also <em>purely coincidentally</em> does a shitload of political campaigning too is the easiest thing in the world. The National Council of La Raza is exactly that, for example.</p>

<p>Is a Latino advocacy group &quot;purely coincidentally&quot; helping the party that&#39;s for immigration reform? No. It&#39;s not coincidence. </p>

<p>Is a African American Civil rights group just by chance left leaning? Or is advocating for civil rights of minorities pretty much synonymous with being a leftist at this point?  </p>

<p>Especially considering the specific examples actually given by Fox news:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>For example, in the FY16 Enacted Congressional Appropriation, Congress allotted $47 million for the HUD Housing Counseling, but the Citi and Bank of America settlements shipped in an additional $30 million in funding.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Similarly </p>

<blockquote>
<p>The recent Volkswagen settlement, which requires a $1.2 billion investment into zero emission technology, was not only twice denied by Congress but is now expected to receive four times the amount originally requested by the Obama administration.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That sounds great to me. I don&#39;t know why they chose not to include any of the specifics on how money went to la raza or the urban league. </p>

<p>The scandal here is not whether this activity was expressly illegal. To be clear, it was not. The scandal arises from the clear partisan intention revealed by the practice of accepting fine reductions in exchange for donations to certain activist groups (whose activities the Democrats would have a political motive to support). These deals were made at the expense of higher fine payments that would have been received by the Treasury. These were politically-motivated settlement deals reached at the expense of the American public.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is quite a lot of things to unpack here.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>The money from the bank settlements should have gone back to the people to help with their foreclosures but did not. (Obamas administration supported banks over people FACT).</p></li>
<li><p>Banks were instead incentivised to pay to third party groups instead</p></li>
<li><p>The money did not pass through and had no transparency through congress, who is responsible for appropriations.</p></li>
<li><p>The money was collected as a slush fund (black money) to fund activist groups and god knows what else.</p></li>

<p>Seriously though, I&#39;m completely on board that shills have too much of a presence on Reddit.  However, I don&#39;t see the benefit of spending time trying to identify individual shills.  Just be constantly aware that people are trying to influence how you think, as well as your voting behavior, and trust your ability to think critically and realize when you are not getting the whole story.</p>
