        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>We have to start organizing. We&#39;re the only defense left against the real tyranny here. We have knowledge, yet we lack conviction. I&#39;m not even saying we start the revolution, I&#39;m saying we plan it. If we&#39;re really serious about exposing war crimes, scandals, and human trafficking, we can&#39;t rely on Anonymous or some hero to come unite us, because WE ARE THAT FORCE. We can figure out how to take down the most powerful force this world has ever seen, and literally change the course of humanity. But we can&#39;t ever operate online, which is, in my opinion, what holds us back. We have to work in the shadows as they do, we have to workin secrecy as they do. Not only do we have to continue to red pill people, but we have to find ways to break the system aside from eliminating debt or sharing edgy articles. You might not think this is a war because there aren&#39;t any soldiers in your city or gun shots at night, but thats because the war isn&#39;t just on an actual front anymore. We have to seriously think about our future goals and what our solution is to the system we have currently. If we can&#39;t all focus on the solution, what we want to do instead, then all this work is for nothing, and all the people who die from wars, police, occupation, everything, all die in vain. I would like to suggest we create a code to discuss topics in secrecy, especially if we are to draw the least suspicion.</p>

<p>EDIT: Some of you fail to understand that I am not claiming to be the leader of this rebellion, I am not claiming I have an in-depth analysis of the government&#39;s weaknesses and how to exploit them, and I am not your Messiah with god-like hacking abilities with the leadership capabilities of Martin Luther King Jr. and Jesus of Nazareth himself. You are primarily the reason we are so divided, weak, and non-cohesive, as looking at individuals is exactly how NOT to unify. Every time someone tries to step up and unite us as a group, you attack that person individually, and try to discredit them, instead of focusing on the important ideas being talked about. Of course my argument has flaws, every argument does. I&#39;m here to discuss and move towards viable, feasible solutions that we can actually act upon, rather than arguing about my credentials and previous posts on unrelated subreddits.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>who said that I was going to single handedly lead this sub into an organized rebellion. And I have prior knowledge on programming &amp; coding, political theory, world history, American history, Public Policy, Economics, and psychology. I&#39;m not Albert Einstein, but who said that an expert in the field has to lead a revolution. Our founding fathers were slave owners and you want to tell me I&#39;m not qualified? The majority of us are unqualified, and the majority of us are probably weak both physically and mentally, but that shouldn&#39;t matter. The idea we are fighting for should transcend beyond who we are individually. And the majority of the time, revolutions are overtaken by stronger powers within the organization. What experience do you have? Probably the same as mine, if not just a little bit more in comparison to the overwhelming power of the most complex government in history. You think any of us, individually, have a chance at reversing this system, then you fail to understand that it is the group as a whole, and not the individual, who can bring down a corrupt system. Why should I have to be Alan Turing, JFK, Martin Luther King Jr., and Ghandi in one fucking package just because it doesn&#39;t fit your vision of a revolution. We&#39;re in it together, and if you fail to see that you might as well work for the government and wish to see us fail</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think you&#39;re mistaking my criticism for a lack of endorsement when in reality that couldn&#39;t be further from the truth. No one is saying you need to be all of those individuals rolled into one. To be an expert in all of their respective fields is unrealistic, but to be an expert in one field is necessary. There are however issues with each proposed method of implementation that could put yourself in danger. Rather than to nay say, I posted to voice caution to a half-cocked idea that will in the very least reflect poorly on this community when it comes out the plan was orchestrated on Reddit.</p>

<p>Our founding fathers being slave owners or not had nothing to do with their qualifications. They were qualified because they were businessmen, lawyers, and the landed gentry. They were wealthy and influential; the only true requisites for such a position.</p>

<p>You speak of fighting but can you even give a name or face to your enemy? You advocate violence or vigilante action without speaking of the direction it should be aimed or laying out some form of moral code. While those in power now may be completely malevolent as you state (though to assume all government workers wish to see you fail would require the same naiveté required to make the original post in the first place) to openly call for revolution, let alone violence, is to put an enormous target on your own head, as well your co-conspirators&#39;.  </p>

<p>Unless this post was designed to rally a bunch of conspiracy nuts in an attempt at fostering a bad image of the sub, I&#39;m not sure this is the best way to accomplish what you&#39;re speaking about.</p>

I am drawing attention to the fact this whole post is a pointless feel-good call to action. It offers no ground work, no direction to move into, no guidance. The only thing this offers the reader is the ability to agree and feel good for agreeing. People&#39;s lives are on the line, so why waste time with fluff and nice words?

    <div class="md"><p>My opinion on this matter is simple: stop making calls to action, start taking action. If you want change stop asking others to make it for you. I suggest you establish your own basic concepts and ground work for how we can move forward, and post it as a comment on this post for the community to run with. It&#39;s  just like in an emergency.

    <div class="md"><p>the problem is that lies have been revealed multiple times, and they quickly fade just as quickly as they were spread. People&#39;s memories are short and the ones who need convincing are in particular more susceptible to persuasion and thus useless in terms of making any real change. The American revolution was highly unpopular up until blood was spilt. Blood has been spilt now, and we&#39;re still questioning whether or not to act upon it. Lies will be exposed regardless while we work for justice, peace, and accountability, but if we do not make moves, the elite will always be one step ahead. I&#39;ll state it again as well, even if we publicly declare secrecy, they will still only see this as our primary source of communication, and automatically assume, due to hubris, that no organization could operate without being dependent on the web. Odds are, we live in a simulation with other life forms, and the rabbit hole goes further than even we can sometimes comprehend, so I think regardless you&#39;re always going to get people who go &#39;crazy&#39; and resort to violence. I think chaos in this sense, and violence, are positive, because it disorientates everybody, including the elite who thought they had things under wraps. You put everybody on the same playing field with the same level of knowledge and information, regardless of if they believed it prior or not, and you will get a somewhat fair outcome. We will never fully red pill society to the point where we will have the majority, we have to initiate our plan to make them realize they are fighting the same fight we are, and that we have a common enemy. That alone will put the ones either on the fence or in the dark on our side. And the ones that don&#39;t? Well only god can save them now.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ignore the negative comments, OP. I truly love your enthusiasm. Nothing makes me happier than seeing posts like this. It truly is time to stand up. NEVER go with people&#39;s suggestions of violence. And fuck secrecy, fuck the NSA. You think I give a shit if they know our plans? It is so important to remember to NEVER use violence. That&#39;s what they want. </p>

<p>Our goal: Stop playing their game.</p>

<p>I&#39;m really serious OP, never mention violence, or a revolution. Think about it, that&#39;s treason. They take treason very seriously, can you imagine why? They will lock you up. Please take my advice. NEVER mention violence, and NEVER mention a &quot;revolution&quot;. </p>

<p>Again, I love your post. Never take attacks personally. People are just discouraging you. They don&#39;t think it can happen. However, YOU think it can happen, along with many others. We, the people, have more power than we could possibly imagine. </p>

<p>REMEMBER: WE NEED TO STOP PLAYING THEIR GAME. It&#39;s that simple. No violence needed. I&#39;m PMing you.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The only time I believe violence is necessary is when it is inevitable. If they start slaughtering us, I won&#39;t hesitate to use violence. They have the power, and what seems like the will, to take us all down with them, and I won&#39;t let that happen. Whether it&#39;s destroying our environment, our health, or our lives, they will find a way to break us, and the only way we can break them is through vengeance. These people feel no pain unless it&#39;s in their pockets, they feel no remorse unless it is their own kin, they feel no empathy unless you are them, and we aren&#39;t. They aren&#39;t just going to say &quot;oh yeah, we fucked up&quot; they&#39;re going to rewrite the game, change the rules, and change the type of slavery they try to enforce. Look at how the world reacted to physical slavery, and then look at how that physical slavery changed into mental enslavement. They will manipulate the game, whether we play it or not. Destroy the console, and there won&#39;t be a game to play. It&#39;s important not to play their game. Which means not being materialistic, not giving into corporate consumerism, and remaining skeptical. Everything in your world and mine is set there in place for a reason, and you&#39;ll react unconsciously whether you know it or not. Non-violence will only lead to a change in the rules, not us winning the game</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well if they start slaughtering us, that means they&#39;re already in the very final stages of their plan. By not playing their game, I&#39;m talking about mass protests. I&#39;m saying mass protests to get them to disclose 9/11 and all of that shit. But yeah I see what you mean :/</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Nobody is ever going to admit they&#39;re the devil, not even normal citizens who have only done a few bad things in their life. We have to get that information, disclose it ourselves, and publicly embarrass them. They&#39;re powerful to the point where they can manipulate the MSM, they simply would discredit us and that&#39;s all they would have to do. If we don&#39;t provide concrete evidence and a platform to solve it in the future, no one will stand with us</p>
