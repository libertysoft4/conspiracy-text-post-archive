    <div class="md"><p>Clapper and intelligence reports actually place blame on RT for propoganda. Hahahahaha. Really?  Here&#39;s a nice little exercise: go to RT website or watch RT America.  It will be foreign to most readers to read REAL, unbiased journalism. Now compare those news reports in RT to MSM in America.  The difference in unbiased truth based reporting is staggering.   All the Russians have to do is report the actual truth and sit back and watch as America tear itself apart.    It&#39;s brilliant really</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Is a government funded news agency really considered unbiased? RT is funded by the Russian government, and I imagine it is hard to distinguish the actual direction of news the government does or doesn&#39;t push on RT. But I do believe one of the cornerstones of democracy is to have government free media agencies. And that being said I have seen more than one rt article that can be claimed as &quot;propaganda&quot;. That isn&#39;t to say RT doesn&#39;t have truth to plenty of their articles, it is always good to get foreign input on how they see developments inside one country. </p>

    <div class="md"><p><em>Exactly.</em> The accusations are so vague and nebulous...what the fuck is there even to debunk? I mean, how could you possibly claim that there was <em>no</em> Russian involvement in the US election? For example, pro-Putin media outlets tended to lean towards Trump in the 2016 election - does that constitution interference to these people? I don&#39;t even know what we&#39;re arguing about...</p>

<p>Certainly I have seen absolutely ZERO evidence that Russia in any way interfered <em>improperly</em> with the Presidential election. But I&#39;m sure there were many in the Russian government who reached out to Trump during his Presidential campaign, just like there were probably many who reached out to Hillary, too. </p>

<p>This whole Russia shit is just so asinine. The very idea that people would seriously be discussing whether &quot;Russia hacked the election&quot; in fucking 2017 is just so god damn stupid. I can&#39;t believe it. <em>Leftists really are useful idiots.</em> There, I said it. These people are fucking bottomfeeder tier retarded. Fucking idiots. They will literally believe anything they see on the TEEVEE regardless of how ridiculous it is or how scant the evidence.</p>

<p>We are past the tipping point in our nation; the government is safe from retaliation by those of us who know because our voices are drowned out by the fucking idiot masses. I can only speak for myself, but personally, Trump is the siren song of a lost America. </p>

<p>Give &#39;em hell you fucking glorious bastard.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s a good question. </p>

<p>On the one hand, I take it for granted that the governments of the world attempt and occasionally succeed in tampering with each other&#39;s governments. </p>

<p>On the other hand, to make such a big deal about something that is common place makes me call into question the people making all the fuss.  While I think Trump as president is an awful shame I have yet to see any evidence that our government is any worse off.</p>

<p>It was a corrupt mess and continues to be so.  </p>

<p>So, evidence to me would consist of not only actually see or hearing the collaboration between trump campaign and Russia but, perhaps more importantly, the consequences of that action.  &quot;Trump as president&quot; in and of itself sucks balls but if that is all Russia can do then it&#39;s really not worth getting worked up over. </p>

<p>Just because the hacker used a Russian keyboard and that malware was used that was developed by a Russian military official is not PROOF that the Russian government hacked the DNC. Also, a hacker wouldn&#39;t be that dumb to leave those kinds of traces behind. If anything, they would leave traces behind that are meant to intentionally mislead the party that was hacked. As far as the Podesta emails, we know that was simply a phishing scam. Could&#39;ve been done by anyone.</p>

<p>But at the end of the day, none of this is proof of anything. It&#39;s just a political tactic being used to turn the American public against the Trump administration and part of a larger plan to get him impeached and get Pence in. Because we know that Pence will protect the deep state.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>When CrowdStrike investigated the DNC hacks they identified <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cozy_Bear">Cozy Bear (A.K.A. APT-29)</a> as one of the actors in the hack. Cozy Bear is a group of Russian hackers who are largely suspected to be hackers associated with the Russian government.</p>

<p>CrowdStrike found that Cozy Bear were inside the DNC computer systems for over a year before the election. This actually provides even more possibility that the hacking group was involved in a nation-state outfit (like the Russian government) as they were sitting inside the DNC&#39;s computers with full access to internal communications for months without a trace. </p>

<p>You can read more about their findings in the blog they made public, <a href="https://www.crowdstrike.com/blog/bears-midst-intrusion-democratic-national-committee/">here</a></p>

<p>And since you brought up John McAfee it&#39;s worth pointing out that the person responsible for identifying the Cozy Bear hackers at CrowdStrike is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dmitri_Alperovitch">Dimitri Alperovitch, the Vice President of Threat Research at McAfee</a> and that John McAfee has not worked at McAfee since 1994. </p>

<p>If that is what happened you will never in your lifetime have proof of it.

<p>You are asking reddit users to give you proof to something that is imppossible to do. While at the same time using the lack of proof in your argument that Russia wasn&#39;t involved.</p>

<p>Not only does that ignore all of the circumstantial evidence but it&#39;s really disingenuous on your part. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The media operates to influence public opinion, not inform it. Sessions met with a Russian ambassador in his capacity as a US Senator as did other senators like Sen. Mary Landrieu (La.) and Sens. Maria Cantwell (Wash.), Bob Casey (Pa.), Amy Klobuchar (Minn.), Jack Reed (R.I.), Sheldon Whitehouse (R.I.) and Claire McCaskill (Mo.). Suddenly, the day after Trump&#39;s speech to congress (after he gains some momentum) headlines appear everywhere: Jeff Sessions met with Russian Ambassdor and lied about it under oath.</p>

<p>Then suddenly there are calls for him to resign. Headlines calling for him to resign. It&#39;s a witch hunt. It&#39;s not as simple as &quot;multiple people from trumps campaign resigned, facts are facts.&quot; If you can&#39;t see that then you aren&#39;t looking deep enough into the situation. Suddenly the story isn&#39;t about who he met with (which is completely normal), but it&#39;s about how he lied under oath. It&#39;s all semantics. Where was that outrage when James Clapper lied under oath about the NSA spying on American citizens? Liberal media ignored it. It was clearly a coordinated and carefully timed attack. With Flynn it was the same thing. The liberal/conservative elites are working with the media with the goal of influencing public opinion and ultimately impeaching Trump. So you are right, there are many facts. But the headlines and the way in which the media presents the information is key to controlling public perception. It happens from multiple directions. CNN, Washington Post, NYT, MSNBC, CBS, TYT, and more are on the side of the liberals. Fox News, Breitbart, Infowars, RT and more are on the side of conservatives/Trump. But each source varies from one another in certain ways. You can&#39;t get caught up in one side or the other and you must watch all of them with an open mind. I&#39;m not a Trump supporter, and I didn&#39;t vote for him. But I am willing to defend him and call bullshit where I see it. I am seeing a lot of bullshit from these so called journalists. I am a member of the working class, not a member of the Washington elite. If you don&#39;t think that liberal/conservative media directly coordinates with Washington to influence public opinion, and they are all apart of the same club, then you are in for a rude awakening. </p>

<p>He alluded to it all coming from insider leaks but I think that&#39;s bullshit. </p>

<p>Looking at some of the findings from cybersecurity companies and reading the ODNI reports there&#39;s no doubt in my eyes that there were hackers. Who the hackers were? I have no way of knowing </p>

<p>But if it were coming from inside leaks that would mean the insiders hacked themselves and purposely left behind code and an entire trail of bread crumbs? And they somehow posessed enough knowledge to throw off some of the best cybersecurity experts in the world and fool them into thinking the insider leaks were actually being committed by nation-state hackers on the other side of the world? I mean I like a good conspiracy and all but that just seems ridiculous</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Cozy Bear and Fancy Bear are actually malware familys--not &quot;hacker groups&quot;--despite what the media and wikipedia has asserted. From <a href="https://arstechnica.com/security/2016/07/clinton-campaign-email-accounts-were-targeted-by-russians-too/">Arstechnica</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Fancy Bear is the malware family tied to &quot;Operation Pawn Storm&quot; and other recent breaches targeting members of the media, US and NATO allied military organizations, government agencies, embassies, and defense contractors, as well as Russian political dissidents and opposition political parties.</p>

<p>Also typically installed by a phishing attack, the Cozy Bear implant is a combination of remote access backdoor, keylogger, screenshot capturer, and password stealer. It can also be used to remote-install other malware on the victim&#39;s Windows computer. If Cozy Bear captures the right credentials, it can connect to other systems and spread laterally through a network.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It fits the MO of a Russian operation, but as other security experts have noted, any significant, state-sponsored, hacking event would be almost impossible to attribute. It also doesn&#39;t make sense Russia would use keyboards and timezones within Russia (or Russian-made malware with the eponymous Bear in the name for that matter) for the attacks if they were truly responsible. </p>

<p>The XAgent app is fully functional malware. After being installed on iOS 7, the app’s icon is hidden and it runs in the background immediately. When we try to terminate it by killing the process, it will restart almost immediately.</p>

<p>Installing the malware into an iOS 8 device yields different results. The icon is not hidden and it also cannot restart automatically. This suggests that the malware was designed prior to the release of iOS 8 last September 2014.</p>

<p>On the &#39;command and control server bulshit:</p>

<p>Here are the IP&#39;s from Crowdstrike:</p>

<p>185.100.84.134 is a Romanian broadband server.</p>

<p>58.49.58.58 is a Chinese broadband server.</p>

<p>218.1.98.203 is another Chinese broadband server.</p>

<p>187.33.33.8 is a Brazil broadband server.</p>

<p>185.86.148.227 is a Swedish server</p>

<p>45.32.129.185 is from Choopa LLC in San Jose, California</p>

<p>23.227.196.217 is a corporate server associated with Swiftway Communications from Wilmington Delaware</p>

<p>So... where is the evidence that these are only used by Russian intelligence?</p>

<p>Here is the WordFence analysis of the malware from the Joint Report:</p>

<p><a href="http://archive.is/KiX1w">http://archive.is/KiX1w</a></p>

<p>The found the malware to be:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>By viewing the source code, we could find the name of the malware and the version. It is P.A.S. 3.1.0.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Which is produced in Ukraine:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>We googled it and found a website that makes this malware. You can find the site at this address: <a href="http://profexer.name/pas/download.php">http://profexer.name/pas/download.php</a></p>

<p>In their concluding remarks we find this:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The PHP malware sample they have provided appears to be P.A.S. version 3.1.0 which is commonly available and the website that claims to have authored it says they are Ukrainian.</p>

<p>Mind you Crowdstrike is the same company which blamed the Sony hack on North Korea. </p>

<p>Here is a MicroTrend analysis of Pawn Storm.  Read the report. No attribution to groups like apt 28 or 29 and certainly no claims that it was Russian Intelligence.</p>

<p>Read your own report by welivesecurity which does not attribute apt 28 and 29 to Russian intelligence. </p>

<p>So please, do provide some evidence that links these groups.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>From the Fireeye report we really see that the emperor has no clothes. </p>

<p>There are 3 points the report tries to make. One is that primary language setting of 103 pieces of malware was &#39; consistently&#39;  Russian:  </p>

<p><a href="https://i.imgur.com/IYbZkUg.png">https://i.imgur.com/IYbZkUg.png</a></p>

<p>We can see the breakdown 59 Russian, 27 US English, 16 Neutral and 1 one from Great Britain.   No implication of Russian Intelligence here!</p>

<p>Point 2 is that supposedly 89 percent of the malware was compiled during Moscow Business hours:</p>

<p><a href="https://i.imgur.com/cCjM1Au.png">https://i.imgur.com/cCjM1Au.png</a></p>

<p>Look at the distribution of  time. UTC +4 or Moscow time starts at 3 UTC, but no Malware is compiled then.  If we wonder how many have been compiled at UTC +3, where the business day starts at 7 we get the exact same amount.  Look at the frequency of compilation:</p>

<p><a href="https://i.imgur.com/TjG2R49.png">https://i.imgur.com/TjG2R49.png</a></p>

<p>For all we know this could be compiled in Ukraine in the summer time giving us safe margin for UTC +3.  The time zone argument is so vast it offers very weak support that it was compiled in Russia, and no support that it was compiled by Russian Intelligence. </p>

<p>The third point that this report makes is that the phishing attacks are consistent with targets that Russia would be interest in.  So US arm dealers, NATO websites, etc.  This is the strongest evidence of Russian government involvement, and it is no evidence at all. </p>

<p>So to repeat, do you have evidence that APT 28 or 29 are Russian Intelligence?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, I want evidence of which you are yet to provide any other than insertions like Apt 28 is Russian Intelligence.    I want to make my bias clear.  I don&#39;t think Russians hacked the DNC and I don&#39;t think you provided any evidence for it.  But there is a lot of BS like trying to pass of Ukranian Malware as Russian, or claiming Guciffer 2.0 is Russian, etc.  So far there is plenty of evidence that evidence provided for the Russia hacked narrative is fraudulent, and zero evidence that APT is connected to Russian Intelligence.  </p>

<p>Trump, himself, says Russia hacked the DNC.</p>

<p>There&#39;s evidence Flynn spoke to the Russians about sanctions. He stepped down.</p>

<p>Manafort worked for a known Russian puppet. This info got out, and he stepped down.</p>

<p>Sessions met with the Russian Ambassador during the campaign. He lied about it under oath. Why would he lie about it?</p>

<p>He then recused himself from the investigation. Why would he recuse himself?</p>

<p>The GOP changed their policy on Ukraine right after Sessions met the embassador. That&#39;s an odd coincidence.</p>

<p>Is that enough evidence to convict? No, but any reasonable person can see something&#39;s up. And the investigation is ongoing. Stuff is gonna keep coming out. </p>

<p>What evidence do you want? It&#39;ll probably be released soon.</p>

<p>The real question here is not whether or not Russia helped Trump, it&#39;s whether or not it you are Okay with the CIA going after a democratically elected president, even if he&#39;s clearly on Russia&#39;s cock.</p>

<p>What evidence do you have this scandal will lead to a war?</p>

<p>That&#39;s a very inflammatory thing to say with no evidence.</p>

<p>Yes. This is important and we should focus on this as well, but it should not be used to deflect from Trump&#39;s issues, and it&#39;s not the subject of this post.</p>

<p>But, yes. Fuck Hillary Clinton.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Or that there is no need to go to war with Russia over some stupid bullshit with no evidence at all</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The fact you don&#39;t grasp the irony here is hilarious. You say there will be war with Russia, something you have no evidence of, while complaining about a lack of evidence in this instance.</p>

<p>What evidence d you have this will lead to war with Russia?</p>

<p>You are just fear mongering.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What do you think pursuing all this Russia nonsense leads to?  Patty cake?  War, numskull!  By skipping over due process right to the part where we accuse and act against a foreign state, IS advocating escalation (war).  We played that game with Iraq, already.  Let&#39;s learn from our hasty decisions and use caution this next time, eh?</p>

<p>Also, have you not noticed the idea that US wants to make Russia the bad guy because Russia isn&#39;t playing with US&#39;s monopoly money, and teaming up with other countries to follow suite?  And what a surprise, US is in conflict with all those other countries (Lybia, Syria, Iraq...)</p>

<p>You mean twice, not several?  One lied to his boss, not Congress or the public.  The other accidentally answered a two part question in a way that was spun into &quot;blatent lies&quot;.  Neither were found of wrongdoing.</p>

<p>Trump, himself, says Russia hacked the DNC.
There&#39;s evidence Flynn spoke to the Russians about sanctions. He stepped down.
Manafort worked for a known Russian puppet. This info got out, and he stepped down.
Sessions met with the Russian Ambassador during the campaign. He lied about it under oath. Why would he lie about it?
He then recused himself from the investigation. Why would he recuse himself?
The GOP changed their policy on Ukraine right after Sessions met the embassador. That&#39;s an odd coincidence.
Is that enough evidence to convict? No, but any reasonable person can see something&#39;s up. And the investigation is ongoing. Stuff is gonna keep coming out.</p>

<p>I&#39;d also add, if all these anonymous sources are fake, why is Trump complaining about leaks?</p>

<p>Leaks mean people in the know are releasing information, not the media just inventing things. In complaining about these leaks, Trump indicates there is accurate information getting out.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;m not saying any of this. I don&#39;t know how deep it is, but I doubt Trump is a Manchurian Candidate.</p>

<p>What I am saying is that there are way too many coincidences for Trump and Russia not to be in bed in some way.</p>

<p>The DNC gets hacked by Russia, as Trump acknowledges. </p>

<p>Trump&#39;s inner circle seems to have all these weird connections with Russia.</p>

<p>Trump has taken a really soft tone on Russia, and, specifically, Ukraine.</p>

<p>This is basic logic. This has legs.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Say Trump&#39;s cabinet members had contact with Russian diplomats. So fucking what? Again - Obama in 2012 before he was reelected told a Russian diplomat to tell Putin he&#39;d be &quot;more flexible&quot; after the election. So were you out there in 2012 screaming from the rooftops like a retarded child about how &quot;OBAMA IS IN BED WITH DAH RUSSKIES!!!&quot;?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is a ridiculous comparison. We aren&#39;t just talking about Trump being nice to Russia, we&#39;re talking about Trump making a deal with Russia to hack his political opponent in exchange for lifting sanctions and taking a soft tone on Ukraine.</p>

<p>These are not at all the same.</p>

<p>That being said, I don&#39;t like Obama. I&#39;m sure there&#39;s lots of dirt on Obama, but we aren&#39;t talking about Obama or Clinton, we&#39;re talking about Trump.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It does sound like the dems are completely lost trying to do anything to delegitimize the trump presidency, however I don&#39;t think it&#39;s a complete smoke screen.  trump is a billionaire who has most definitely been intertwined with russian business deals. He&#39;s a billionaire, putin is a billionaire, the real scandal, and I guess it&#39;s not really that big of a surprise is that the world has already become a globalist government. The world is a playground for billionaires and only looks like a world of nations to us little people.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>honestly, noticing the push back is the thing thats kept me most interested even as the stories ebb and flow. &quot;Users&quot; come in loud and in numbers saying its NOT a conspiracy, which is literally the least likely thing for conspiracy fans to say (IF they didnt have an agenda). Also, whenever there is breaking news on the topic (Flynn, Sessions, Dossier etc) this place goes NUTS. Weird things start happening. Front page flooded with human trafficking busts (if you go in the thread its prostitution stings) and self posts reminding people that pizzagate is still a thing that deserves attention. </p>

<p>Its so fishy I love it.</p>

<p>Plus reading &quot;The Agency&quot; and other stuff about these state sponsored trolls who seek to change public opinions is fascinating.</p>

<p>Where did I say the US is good. I think the US is way shittier than it could be but Russia is just on another level.

    <div class="md"><p>Flynn was cleared of all wrongdoing and criminal activity by the FBI after the fact - meaning whatever he said about sanctions was perfectly legal and allowed. His only crime was in not reporting everything back to Pence, which may have been inadvertent.</p>

<p>You cannot prove Sessions lied about anything. He attended his meeting with the Russian ambassador as a Senator on the Senate Armed Services Committee and was not involved with the Trump campaign at the time. He is being attacked on semantics and context - he took the question as whether he had met as a Trump campaign member, which the answer was &#39;no&#39;, but he didn&#39;t include his time as a Senator before then. That&#39;s fairly understandable, but ultimately he should have clarified or remembered. Either way - its a pretty weak reason to call for someone to resign. Their meeting was scheduled by the Obama administration - it wasn&#39;t even set up by his own people.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>If the Russia/Trump stuff is completely fabricated by the media working along with the deep state, why wouldn&#39;t he respond with outrage? Trump using twitter is no longer a valid point - we all know he uses Twitter. It doesn&#39;t mean anything, and half the time his tweets are true but the media keeps parroting lies anyways.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Saying there are no indications that he has ties to Russia is ridiculous, more investigations have to be done though before we know for sure either way.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The investigations have been done. Do you think Obama and Hillary weren&#39;t looking high and low before the election? Do you think people are sitting on evidence? It&#39;s a joke. They are making all this shit up, and they have NOTHING to substantiate it. According to Wikileaks and Julian Assange, they got the DNC hacked emails from an insider (some think Seth Rich (RIP), Guccifer has singled out Warren Flood) and not from the Russians, but hey - they&#39;re just the people who released the hack.</p>

<p>Have you wondered why the international community hasn&#39;t even commented on this? Because there is no proof. You cannot go to the  international community without some evidence of wrong-doing, and the deep state can&#39;t come up with a single thing. That should say enough.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Golden shower stuff? </p>

<p>Trump gives Putin some material to use as propaganda?</p>

<p>What is an absolute gold mine for Putin?</p>

<p>I can&#39;t make any sense of what you&#39;re saying. I also can&#39;t make out a single viable threat or motive. It&#39;s not like Trump and Putin can do whatever they want because he&#39;s president - if they are linked into making shady business deals, the ethics people will be on top of them like flies on shit. </p>

<p>The only motive I can make out for Russia to get Trump in power is purely to try to dodge a third world war that Hillary was talking up the entire campaign trail as tensions grew in Syria. I don&#39;t blame them for not wanting to start an armed conflict in their backyard over long-held assets in the middle east. </p>

<p>Really? That is the only motive you can come up with? Like nothing about sanctions, oil prices etc. (not that I claim this to be the true motives but surely an option)?</p>

<p>Clinton talked about a no fly zone, that&#39;s hardly a WW(in fact the opposite). Nobody wants an actual war with Russia, Russia is already beaten in almost every way.</p>

<p>Why does Putin matter? Trump is who matters on the US side of things, no?</p>

<p>Putin doesn&#39;t need Trump to do that. Putin&#39;s already a pretty popular guy in Russia.</p>

<p>The sanctions were in place over the disagreement in Syria. As soon as Trump and Putin agreed to fight ISIS together, they fell off as they should have. Now - are you going to argue that having a united front against ISIS is a bad thing? Or are you one who thinks we should arm and fund terrorists so we can get rid of the terrorists?</p>

<blockquote>

<p>You don&#39;t seem to understand how geopolitics plays out. Clinton also started with no-fly zones in Libya - do you remember how that turned out?</p>

<p>Because that is what Putin does. Whenever a critic of him is being shot he just points at the US and says &quot;They are bad too&quot;. It&#39;s an old soviet tactic called whataboutism. Now the President of the United states literally made the same argument. The opposition uses the US as the example of how better and democratic Russia could look, Trump saying it&#39;s just as bad is a huge blow to the opposition.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Putin doesn&#39;t need Trump to do that. Putin&#39;s already a pretty popular guy in Russia.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Indeed he is. Though that is mainly due to the annexation of Crimea and the current economical situation is eroding that jump(though more of the government as a whole). It&#39;s only so long that the patriotic fervor he inspired can make up for the ongoing recession.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>I don&#39;t remember it ending in a nuclear World War.</p>

<p>Kind of like how Hillary Clinton should be locked up and everyone knows her husband is a rapist, but nobody does anything about it.</p>

<p>As far as the topic at hand. The Kremlin uses typewriters and the democrats are desperate to continue war in Syria, Ukraine, Yemen etc. something Russia does not want.</p>

<p>I choose to side with the people helping remove ISIS From Syria (a DNC funded terrorist group) and giving the land back to their legally and democratically elected leader.</p>

<p>Trump&#39;s opposition Clinton, was integral in the destruction of the country of Libya, one of the most prosperous African nations of all time. It amazes me that BLM supports her, when she clearly does not support them. They also recently took the Clinton Foundation out of Haiti, but everyone paying attention know that&#39;s because they didn&#39;t want to get busted for human trafficking ;)</p>

<p>Speaking of human trafficking! Did you know thats what arguing about refugees and immigrants is? Mainstream corporate human trafficking!</p>

<p>Shut the borders down and stop these sick fucks and the process of bombing people out of their homes and telling them where to live and assimilate. It&#39;s fucking nonsense.</p>

<p>Those are facts.  They are objective and you cannot argue them.  However, the subjective part is the link between Fancy Bear and the Russian Government.  A lot of people believe that there are strong ties to the Russian Government.  I really don&#39;t have an opinion on this link.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Absolutely the only people I&#39;ve seen bringing up the concept of &quot;WAR WITH RUSSIA!!!!&quot; are pro-Trump talking-point repeaters and critics of those trying to figure out if the Trump campaign colluded with Russian ops and/or Assange in order to win the election. Glenn Greenwald warns of Dem hypocrisy and the potential dangers of red scare 2.0, but even he won&#39;t claim that anyone is pushing for real WMD-type war initiation. Ditto anyone from the intelligence community or any gov official. Well, besides that Putin-surrogate Russian official and Trump himself. </p>

<p>Also, whenever WAR WITH RUSSIA!!!! is suggested (by Trump devotees and critics of those considering/investigating conspiracy) no attempt is made to debunk the ties between Trump and co and Russian oligarchs, banks, former mobsters, etc, we just get the general refrain of NOTHING TO SEE HERE. </p>

<p>If Putin tried to influence the election, that&#39;s fair game as far as I&#39;m concerned. If Team Trump played a role in it, that&#39;s collusion and/or treason, and that&#39;s what this conspiracy theory is all about. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not sure you read my comment. </p>

<p>Your question</p>

<blockquote>
<p>What is an absolute gold mine for Putin?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Part of my last comment </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Trump saying Russia isn&#39;t any worse than the US for example is an absolute gold mine for Putin.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>How does that not answer your question?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>if they are linked into making shady business deals, the ethics people will be on top of them like flies on shit.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>They will be over Trump, they won&#39;t be over Putin. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>The only motive I can make out for Russia to get Trump in power is purely to try to dodge a third world war</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Really? That is the only motive you can come up with? Like nothing about sanctions, oil prices etc. (not that I claim this to be the true motives but surely an option)?</p>

<p>Clinton talked about a no fly zone, that&#39;s hardly a WW(in fact the opposite). Nobody wants an actual war with Russia, Russia is already beaten in almost every way.</p>

<p>What does the Ukraine thing have to do with the topic? </p>
