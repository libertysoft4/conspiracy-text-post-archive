For example, I disagree with his position on Snowden.  However, that being said, he literally said in his inaugration speech that a small group of people were running the country (the elites, the bankers, the globalists, you know the people were supposed to be against on this sub?) and that he was gonna take them down and hand the country back to the people.  There&#39;s many other reasons I can cite saying he&#39;s anti-establishment, yet that right there should be enough proof.  Wake the fuck up conspiracy</p>

<p>Trump has his issues and has an ego, but there is no denying that he measures his ego and success by what people think of him. It is actually refreshing to see a president bitch about negative opinions and lies about him rather than pretending that it doesn&#39;t exist.  President who keeps score by seeing how many people like him and criticising those skewing those numbers is better than a president that only cares for his donors, influential friends, and deep state buddies. </p>
