    <div class="md"><p>Your question is basically political and not about conspiracies.  The problem isn&#39;t that you have bias.  The problem is that this is not a politics-based sub where it would matter if you have bias.</p>

<p>But because Trump supporters aren&#39;t finding freedom of expression anywhere else, you are running rough-shod over this subreddit, trying to turn it into your political forum.  Please go somewhere else.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The long-time denizens of this sub know better than to think there is a good party and a bad party.  The newcomers tend to frame the situation as &quot;Obama and democrats are bad, Trump is good.&quot;  Some of them are actual conspiracy theorists who mistakenly believe that Trump has been prosecuting child sex trafficking.  We know that Epstein met Roberts at Mar-a-Lago.  </p>

<p>The typical Trump supporter doesn&#39;t test well in logic tests where both outcomes are false.  They tend to think in either/or reasoning: if this thing is false, the opposite thing is true.  They have a limitation in considering the possibility that two opposite things could be simultaneously true, or simultaneously false.</p>

<p>Yep.  To the people with the limited either/or mentality, it seems like it <em>is</em> impossible.  Brain scans (fMRI) show that they don&#39;t conceive of the duality possibility, they only conceive of the exclusivity in the either/or possibility.  So they literally don&#39;t know it&#39;s possible that Trump and Hillary are both scumbags.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There are more of us here than you think. We just aren&#39;t as vocal and understand that we probably aren&#39;t going to change anyone&#39;s personal political affiliations or ideologies. And there&#39;s just too many on both sides to try to redpill, it would take too much energy.

    <div class="md"><p>Is anyone but me starting to feel like Trump might have been °chosen&quot; by the shadow gov and powerful wealthy people? The amount of help he got was insane and he went against MSM and more powerful people. </p>

<p>Not to be an anti-zionist, but could they have anything to do with it? Netanyahu was quite pleased by him winning and the dems loosing.</p>

<p>Also, the biggest thing Obama did before leaving office was letting the UN vote on settlements go through. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Obama didn&#39;t start these programs he was just the latest to take advantage of the rules. If I recall bush gave money to extreme religious right wing groups Clinton did the same as Obama. I m pretty sure this tradition started with either Reagan or Nixon. When I&#39;m doubt the trail usually leads to those bums. That&#39;s why it&#39;s not a story. It&#39;s wrong and unethical but that&#39;s how it works. I don&#39;t hear many trump fans complaining about the money trump is making off taxpayers or his pay to play schemes.... you can&#39;t have it both ways </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not only is this story old, but it&#39;s fundamentally misleading. </p>

<p>Obama didn&#39;t directly oversee any slush fund. What he did do was allow the DOJ and State Department to run wild without being held accountable. </p>

<p>But the cause of that is beyond Obama. It can be accredited to the establishment democrats that played behind the scenes for 8 years.</p>
