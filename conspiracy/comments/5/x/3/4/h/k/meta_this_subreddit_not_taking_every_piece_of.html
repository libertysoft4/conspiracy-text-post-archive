        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>EVERY god-damn top comment in a Trump-related submission in <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> is a variation of:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I just came here to see how much this would be downvoted. <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> has become a shitty pro-Trump circlejerk. Shame on the_donald.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is ALWAYS the top comment. Meanwhile the thread is usually around 70%-80% upvoted, which is completely normal. The comments are filled with debate, with people on both sides of the issue hashing it out.</p>

<p>STOP with this bullshit that <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> is a Trump circlejerk. Every thread on Trump has people complaining about how pro-Trump everyone else is, and these comments are highly upvoted, which means that at least a large portion of <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> is not pro-Trump at all.</p>

<p>I get it, reddit is a place where each community espouses only one view and everything else is downvoted to oblivion, so  people seeing opinions they disagree with not being immediately downvoted assume that the subreddit must be a circlejerk of those opinions. But it&#39;s time to stop and look at the evidence: every Trump-related submission in here has debate, not agreement, which means the opinion here is split. Stop with this &quot;waaah it&#39;s a circlejerk because not everyone agrees with meeee&quot; bullshit and stick to discussing the facts.</p>

<p>If that were the case, we&#39;d see more posts about Russian involvement</p>

<p>Forget about Trump at the moment, and lets analyze several instances of a media blitz.</p>

<p>Russia hacked our Electric Grid - False claim.</p>

<p>Trump met with a Russian Oligarch in Charlotte - false claim</p>

<p>Micheal Cohen met with Russians in Prague - false claim. </p>

<p>Russia  hacked our election - false claim. </p>

<p>Russia leaked emails to Assange- false claim. </p>

<p>Russia hacked the DNC - false claim. </p>

<p>You don&#39;t care about the fact that every week or so there is a media blitz anti-Russia story that turns out to be false. </p>

<p>Russia is a nuclear power. It is dynamic capitalist country now.  Tensions between our two countries are increasing with a proxy war in Syria already playing out. The Baltic states are having increased military presence on the border. Ukraine is unstable.<br/>
War is a real possibility, and I mean a real war. One where the opposing state can damage our country in a real way.  Maybe you don&#39;t know these things, and just see this as  politically strategic trajectory to get rid of Trump, or setting up 2020 election strategy. I don&#39;t know. What I do know is you are not serious about influence of foreign nations on our government. If that is the case you would be railing against Israel and Saudi Arabia.  At this point the anti-Russia campaign is Propaganda only.  </p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>I will give you my assessment of the situation.  If they did discuss Russian sanctions, which we don&#39;t know if they did all we have is anonymous sources, then I think Pence knew, and he lied about it.  Flynn had to take the fall.</p>

<p>But suppose Flynn did talk to the Russians. Obama administration just threw out Russian diplomats. Obviously attempting to increase tensions.  If Flynn got on the phone as said, &quot; Listen guys, don&#39;t react. Don&#39;t kick out our diplomats out of a country. We need to decrease tensions. Once we are in power that is going to be our policy&#39;.  I say give this man a Nobel peace prize. It is probably the only good policy decision he has taken.  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Can you, without a doubt, prove all of that to me?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>First, proof belongs in math and logic. I can provide some evidence and arguments.</p>

<p>Second certainty is a matter of degree that one can&#39;t induce in another. </p>

<p>What I can do, is provide evidence for these claims, and then you can use your faculty of judgment to evaluate them.  Let us start with the Micheal Cohen story.</p>

<p>Ask any atheist what it&#39;s like to debate a Creationist and they will say exactly the same thing: you cannot force someone to change their beliefs. Conspiracy Nuts are absolutely no different to the fundamentally religious because they <em>are</em> fundamentally religious. They have a worldview that has been shaped by preachers, reinforced by echo-chambers, and they so obstinately refuse to listen to anything that goes against their narrative that detractors become enemies.</p>

<p>Franken: CNN just published a story alleging that the intelligence community provided documents to the president-elect last week, that included information that “Russian operatives claim to have compromising personal and financial information about Mr. Trump.” These documents also allegedly say “there was a continuing exchange of information during the campaign between Trump surrogates and intermediaries for the Russian government.” Again, I’m telling you this as it’s coming out, so you know. But if it’s true, it’s obviously extremely serious, and if there is any evidence that anyone affiliated with the Trump campaign communicated with the Russian government in the course of this campaign, what will you do?</p>

<p>Sessions: Senator Franken, I’m not aware of any of those activities. I have been called a surrogate at a time or two in that campaign and I did not have communications with the Russians, and I’m unable to comment on it.</p>

<p>Flynn was doing his job. Didn&#39;t tell Pence he mentioned sanctions. </p>

<p>Also, it&#39;s a total false equivalency to equate pizzagate and Clinton corruption posts with Trump support.

I support exposing corruption nomatter what political realm.  </p>

<p>Also, how long have you actually been here? For years this sub has been accepting of Russia for a lot of reasons.  They banned a lot of GMO produce.

    <div class="md"><p>I think it&#39;s amusing how leftists always ignore the issues and instead try to attack people with guilt by association or just engage in character smears.</p>

<p>&quot;You said a, but because of b no one should listen to you because that proves you&#39;re bad.&quot;</p>

<p>Progressives are like the religious fanatics of old that used to go around accusing women of being witches. </p>

<p>In any case, didn&#39;t you read the Vox.com article? I&#39;m the alt-right guy that used &quot;PUA&quot; and advice about getting chicks to brainwash and entire generation of young white males into saving Western civilization and building a space base on the Dark Side of the Moon using Nazi Technology.</p>

<p>The Red Pill worked! But they figured out my evil plan and banned me for posting satire. Thankfully leftists aren&#39;t smart enough to recognize satire.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There is a loyal brigade of pro-Trump people  in this sub from T_D and a small  pro-Trump element organic to this subreddit that blindly upvote and downvote all the Trump related posts. This appears to be a very diligent group of voters that seems to make sure to always vote on Trump posts, upvoting if the submission appears to be positive towards Trump and downvoting any and all submissions that are even tangentially questioning and less than positive in their critique of Trump. </p>

<p>Unfortunately, this brigade outnumbers the longtime regulars of the sub who are more or less apolitical and completely understand that our country&#39;s elected government is an illusion designed to fool the majority of the population into believing they actually have a say in what our government is going to actually do. These longtime regulars of this subreddit are the people who understand that, in their lifetime, it has always been the unelected  shadow government of the oligarchy and deep military-corporate complex that make all the important decisions in our country. Unfortunately those of us who clearly understand this and are not  true believers in the political illusion or fooled by the theater are in the minority here right now.</p>

<p>I see 10X as many posts claiming &quot;<a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> is just T_D 2.0, this place sucks now.&quot; than I see posts actually espousing Trump uncritically.  And, like OP said, all the posts bashing this sub for being like T_D are highly upvoted where blind Trump support almost always goes into the negatives.  </p>

<p>Another thing these detractors conflate is anti-DNC or Clinton corruption posts automatically being pro-Trump.  It&#39;s ridiculous, I can&#39;t even count the amount of times I&#39;ve been called a T_Der even though I&#39;ve never gone to that sub and my political views more often align to the left.  I&#39;m not a fucking Trump supporter just because I&#39;m skeptical of the media narrative of &quot;evil Russia&quot; being forced down our throats.</p>

That skepticism is almost never applied in a major way when it comes to anything non-Trump. Yeah, in every thread you have debunkers and what not, but to have Trump-Russia threads disappear and no one talking about Rosneft on a FUCKING CONSPIRACY SUB is all the evidence you need to know that this place has no interest in furthering knowledge and discussion, only more partisan hackery.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yupp. Every day. And I distinctly recall when the Sessions thread was actually up, people peddling the exact same t_d logic of &quot;HE DIDN&#39;T PERJURE HIMSELF, HE SAID HE DIDN&#39;T TALK ABOUT THE CAMPAIGN! HE DIDN&#39;T LIE!&quot;</p>

<p>yeah. I&#39;m not a child. &quot;Not talking to the Russians about the Trump campaign&quot; is a laughable excuse for a man who admitted to being a surrogate of the Trump campaign at that time and just so happened to meet with them at the same time. </p>

<p>&quot;OH HE WAS MEETING IN A DIFFERENT CAPACITY FOR THE ASC-&quot;
&quot;ASC: Our members don&#39;t meet with Russian ambassadors.&quot;
&quot;OH WELL LOOK AT MCCASKILL&#39;S TWEET SHE MET WIT-&quot;
You can be on multiple committees. Homeland Security meeting with the Russians is perfectly normal.</p>

<p>What&#39;s the excuse now? He met with them, sure, but in a different capacity. Oh, what&#39;s that? That capacity also doesn&#39;t have a reason to be talking to the Russian ambassador? Interesting.</p>

It feels organized in that is a constant flood that consistently keeps anything trump/russia related off the front age of this sub. Where is the sessions stuff? there are signs of an actual conspiracy with national security implications going on and we are hearing about local prostitution busts.</p>

<p>AGAIN, watch what happens. Today sessions is in the news. Just like the flynn scandal before, we will see an uptick in pizzagate, podesta, and hillary stuff even though there is NO movement on those subjects. We will see self posts thrown in, denying pro trump movements on here, asking why the shills are trying to disprove pizzagate. we will see more posts with some variation of &#39;still dont believe pizzagate, watch/read this&#39;.

<p>The plus side, in my view, is despite the schism between the Trump haters and the child-fuckers haters, people on both sides are looking at the rich and elites as the enemy, rather than the people who love people we don&#39;t approve of, or the people who look different from us, or the people who believe differently from us.</p>

<p>The Russia thing isn&#39;t a Trump issue in here, it&#39;s a media issue. They lie. They feed the public lies, half truths and distractions on behalf of the government and the rich who hold its chain. And if only the media is saying that Trump is in league with those inhuman Reds... it is a pretty good bet that almost anything else is the truth.</p>

<p>Would the reaction be negative or positive? Is his stance on Russia the single issue that unites them all?</p>

<p>I guess I dont get how Trump is any different, his actions are the same, his appointments are the same. Literally the only difference is he isnt a career politician and the shit he says sounds great but he isnt doing it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Fox News was one outlet (in a much much different media environment) that was out to capture the far-right vote. They were the equivalent of the National Equirerer at this point, so you&#39;re not making a very strong point. This era of Fox News led to ridicule and shame for the network. They reeled it back in after because of how poorly this attitude came off.</p>

<p>Look at the current media - they are united except for half of Fox News and Breitbart Media. Nobody else is even trying to be nice to Trump. I love how you have created this huge conspiracy that Trump is getting the media to attack him on purpose as if we weren&#39;t watching the last year of election coverage play out. Trump was a &#39;pied piper candidate&#39; and he punched them in the mouth and stole their lunch money. The media is still trying to do anything they can to remove him. Again, your take on reality is a joke.</p>

<p>Money, my friend. Going 50/50 makes sense because the market is split similarly. That&#39;s what makes it so strange that they are unifying - Trump is a true threat to them. &#39;The establishment&#39; hasn&#39;t been challenged since JFK, and what we&#39;re seeing now if the new-age version of it all.

<p>I don&#39;t think his trademark had much to do with that, to be honest... I think he just didn&#39;t realize the pecking order as it is right now. He was picking a fight with the biggest kid on the playground, and I think his counsel let him know to shut the hell up very quickly. Trump is pro-Taiwan because of his business dealings there, but he did not understand the serious nature of the &#39;one china&#39; policy in terms of international geopolitics. He had to play nice with China. He didn&#39;t really have any choice unless he wanted to provoke China unlike any president has before.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re right. They fear that if they voted for Trump, and if what the media says about him is true, then that makes them just like Trump. So they refuse to believe the stories about him, or even at the very least listen to the stories about him. Sadly, the ones that refuse to see the truth are the ones that vote the most often. So that keeps Trump and the GOP in power that much longer.</p>

<p>I mean he spends every weekend at a resort or playing golf, he sticks his foot in his mouth every 5 minutes, has reneged on multiple campaign promises, received a stone cold stunner from a pro wrestler, hosted a reality TV show, first military engagement was a huge failure, then blamed the military, made it legal to dump coal refuse into public rivers, accused the previous president of being foreign born (Never showing his proof), repeated interactions with Russia, backpedaling on one China, removing the EPA, backpedaling on federal legalization, increasing support for private prisons, the first lady did softcore porn. </p>

<p>The list goes on and on. </p>

<p>Obama definitely didnt get enough shit for silencing whistle blowers or his illegal drone strike campaigns, not closing gitmo but overall he never tweeted out celebrities saying they were overrated. </p>

<p>No... What Im saying is judge him by his actions. Dont hide behind the idea &quot;The media is unfair, quit being so mean to him&quot;</p>

<p>I know you guys hate this site but its a fairly comprehensive list of the things Trump has said and his efforts to make those things happen. </p>

<p>Im glad he implemented his plan to get rid of ISIS within the first 30 days... Glad he hired wall street execs for his cabinet when he said he was going to drain the swamp... Suspend immigration from countries that engage in terror attacks against the US... Sure Iran has never once attacked us but SA sure as shit has, but they have Trump property so we cant ban them. The guy is a mess. </p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>And that private healthcare costs 2x the amount as the next industrialized country. If the ACA wasnt hamstrung during its conception it would have worked much better. </p>

<p>All Im saying is hold him accountable, thats it. The calls for fake media are bullshit and its used to discredit people that criticize him. </p>

<p>Hold him in his own chamber, dont compare him to other presidents... yet. </p>

<p>Just look at what he says and does. </p>

<p>As a side note, i haven&#39;t seen many anti-trump arguments that hold water, and i consider myself a skeptic. He was very clear about what he was going to do, and so far i&#39;d say that, like it or not, he is doing that. He is supporting israel, he is expanding the military, he is reducing regulations on coal, etc. These were all known ahead of time, and many here don&#39;t like those actions, but they weren&#39;t a bait and switch or a conspiracy.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>A small disclaimer: &#39;I won&#39;t(can&#39;t) go too deep into it, and by all means don&#39;t take my word for it. I still haven&#39;t researched deep enough and my focus isn&#39;t the U.S.A. or contemporary times&#39;</p>

<p>He&#39;s remarkably clean, but focusing in on him is one of the ways to be mislead. The Unites States are a huge machine led by think tanks filled with very well educated people.  Not only that but this machine has been refined over a very long period of time. Some people say that the perfection started in the 1950s but personally I would say that it was already at a full blast well before the unites states were founded. Then again I haven&#39;t researched enough.</p>

<p>But disregarding that completely there are some fairly clear signs (to me) that he is in on the same action they all are. f.e. the democrats and the globalists cheat a 70 year old woman who is being investigated for major war crimes and who knows how much shady work into the front of their list like they want to lose. Then she and her cronies overstate their odds so no one really gets worried and the cheat machine doesn&#39;t run at full power. And during all of this, they&#39;re supposed to have full access to the NSA and yet are felled(partly) by some run of the mill email accounts.
If I was the establishment I would put some real smart people into figuring out how much dissent there was among the people at all times using metadata acquired from my insanely huge spy machine, and then play up a hero supposedly from the other side when it was time. This is an old strategy.</p>

<p>So over to trump himself, he is insanely easy to misunderstand until you&#39;ve made up your mind and either way you swing- after you&#39;re set he reinforces your belief with everything he says, not only because of the staggering amounts of propaganda against him but because he relies so much on power words and little on content. He gets away with saying things that most politicians couldn&#39;t dream of and yet never really cuts to the core. If he had come out in the start with a list of known pedophiles in the government, and other clear lists of crimes that could be verified that would have been one thing. But politician or not, he comes in playing their game and the banks are still doing their thing. Corporatism is a financial duality to fascism after all.</p>

<p>This is just from the top of my mind but as I&#39;ve seen during the campaigns it came clear to people once they started focusing on the things he and Clinton don&#39;t say over what they say.</p>

<p>I&#39;ll agree with the sentiment of him being the best chance of ridding the globalists away, but that <em>strongly</em> feels like level 2 brainwashing. Being a Hillary fan would in that sense be a level 1 programming but there isn&#39;t so much difference. Then there&#39;s always the point that globalists care for the globe, not lines drawn on it.</p>

<p>Not a good answer but hope it makes some sense.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I wholeheartedly agree that the hate is misplaced and should go into real investigation, it&#39;s one thing being against trump for being president and another thing to be against him as a part of the establishment- the former being as brainwashed as any clinton supporter. Personally I haven&#39;t seen much trump hate here but more intolerance for any pro-trump rhetoric which I suppose is seen as state propaganda. I&#39;d gander that few people dedicated to this sub actually believe the U.S.A. to be a democracy so believing in an elected hero of any kind would be equivalent to burying your head in the sand. Heck even a straight up violent revolution wouldn&#39;t be believable.</p>

<p>Yes I would go as far as saying that that kind of push back from the establishment would almost be a prerequisite for trusting someone. But the real power behind the U.S.A. understands this as well, better than any citizen. You can say that trump &quot;hacked&quot; his way into the presidency by manipulating the press, laying new ground rules, and feeding on the hate so to speak. You could also say that he was made president using the tools of the establishment. Trump was as much elected in, as Clinton was elected out after the primaries and Clinton got a free pass past the primaries. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I can understand being anti Hillary but the pro Trump thing is crazy to me. This is the perfect time to take them all down but instead people are just moving from &quot;Government and media are against us&quot; to &quot;So we&#39;re gonna let this other government and media control us!&quot; is ridiculous. Both sides play for the same time why denounce one side and let yourselves be played by the other?</p>

<p>Plus Trump is highly suspect, supported by Russia, wanting to move the Israeli embassy to Jeruslam, talking about bringing more christians to the country. I don&#39;t understand how a place about conspiracies became pro government.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Trump is fucking awful, Sessions too (and I sincerely hope he goes to jail for perjury), but at the same time all this Russia sabre-rattling is circuitously tied in on itself. Trump Admin people talking with Russians only matters because of the &quot;Russian Hack!&quot; accusations and saber-rattling, but there is, was, and has never been a shred of evidence beyond &quot;anonymous sources say!&quot; tying Wikileaks&#39;s release to Russia. </p>

<p>From someone who has been keeping up with pretty much everything getting posted on the subject, it seems like the media told a lie to deflect from the DNCLeaks/Podesta Emails and their role in Hillary&#39;s loss, doubled down on that lie, created elaborate theater to enforce the perception of the truthiness of that lie, and now are demanding resignations and criminal prosecution for lies that only matter if the Russian Hack shit is true in the first place.</p>

<p>The media has shifted from (not, lol) proving allegations that &quot;Russia hacked the election!&quot; into merely having to prove that Trump officials were in contact with Russia, and equating the two as though they are proof of the same conspiracy. </p>

<p>p.s. it is interesting to note that if Trump is &quot;friends with Putin&quot; I&#39;m pretty sure that that would make him the only President since fucking FDR advocating any kind of friendly relations with Russia.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thank you for this. This should be pinned at the top. There is a reason why people don&#39;t believe these Russian stories. We have had tremendous evidence showing how corrupt the Democratic party is:
1.)No coverage about Putin&#39;s warnings toward the media over the summer of a potential war that the U.S. is stirring up.
2.)No coverage of the Guccifer hacked emails that showed pay to play, and rigged elections. Same with the leaked Podesta and leaked Soros emails.
3.)The Project Veritas videos with VIDEO PROOF of people being paid to protest and plot attacks against Trump and his supports as well as frame them. Scott Foval and Robert Creamer lost their jobs because of this but the MSM still discredited and ignored everything.
4.)Nobody cared that the debate questions were leaked to Hillary and the woman who leaked them, and admitted to it, still has her job</p>

Post-election, there&#39;s a bunch of people completely uneducated on the level of deceit, the age and depth of &quot;the big picture&quot; and much of the discourse feels like I&#39;m hanging out in a townie bar, overhearing  skull-numbing conversation... </p>
