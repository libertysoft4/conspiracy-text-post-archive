    <div class="md"><p>We can always try, but if you refresh anything that has touchy information within you can see the vote count change every time you refresh. You would be fighting a battle hardly anyone would see to be honest with you. The internet is conscious.</p>

<p>Try your idea I will be down to see how you guys do, but until you have thousands of up/down votes at your disposal I don&#39;t think you really stand a chance.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s a youtube channel of the current craziest theory that I find not so crazy.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I say we just keep contributing content and convince more actual people to vote in the new queue. I gave it a shot yesterday: <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/5xp0us/what_you_need_to_know_about_trade_secret/?st=izyo0cie&amp;amp;sh=360bcae2">https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/5xp0us/what_you_need_to_know_about_trade_secret/?st=izyo0cie&amp;amp;sh=360bcae2</a></p>

<p>Of course it was largely ignored. </p>

<p>I do my best to vote in here. </p>

<p>The other thing would be stickies. If we could come up with a collaborative post with tons of information, maybe the mods will be nice enough to sticky it. </p>

<p>Finally, don&#39;t forget to venture out into the normal side of Reddit and contribute there. I spend way more time out there than here because there are more people on the fence you can reach. Your efforts will have more impact. </p>

<p>If we see a post that has been posted, and is being massively shill downvoted, we can piggy back on top of it to boost you to the top (considering your post is a good contribution). Same with downvoting shill comments and posts.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Here&#39;s a random idea. We could put our heads together, maybe in this thread, and try to find all of the posts that get buried, then only include information that has bipartisan support so there&#39;s no bias involved. Put it all in one thread and ask the mods for a sticky. We could do this on a weekly basis. Or I&#39;ll do it myself if noone is interested.  I&#39;ll be digging. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think people are just really passionate about different things. Confirmed conspiracies are great because they reinforce the point that these things are worth studying, but I think what gets people really passionate are the ones that remain unsolved. The frustration is that I think a lot of people feel the government and authorities are compliant with some of the worst behaviors - Corruption is the real issue on this planet. </p>

<p>If people are to fight corruption, it requires one to question reality and the status quo because corruption starts with complacency. When people look back over history and see that - in general - anybody with any kind of power or influence get off from all sorts of crimes, do we expect any different moving forward?</p>

<p>This is what people get passionate about. Confirmed conspiracies are great, but they are books that have been written. A lot of people here want to see a book being finished themselves - they want to see a story ended. I think that&#39;s what you&#39;re coming up against here. Just my 2 cents.</p>

<p>Trump happens to be a byproduct of the establishment, and I would very much like to reverse the establishments progress towards a new world order. </p>

<p>I will remain skeptical of him, just as I would have if Hillary had been elected. Government officials and People in power don&#39;t care about you regardless of their party affiliation. That&#39;s the message here. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Over 70 links on astroturfing <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/shills/comments/4kdq7n/astroturfing_information_megathread_revision_8/">can be found here.</a> A lot of governments do this. Corporations do it. Superpacs do it. It&#39;s not a theory or unproven. We are talking about verified, admitted to, factual information. There are Trump shills and Hillary shills. Everything is in that link. If you are interested in shareblue and CTR, here ya go:</p>

<p>There are three ways you can obtain evidence of astroturfing. 1) Publicly admitting to it. 2) Confessions from the workers. 3) Leaving behind evidence on social media. </p>

<p>We have all 3 of these from CTR and similar operations. </p>

<ul>
<li><p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160618091140/http://correctrecord.org/barrier-breakers-2016-a-project-of-correct-the-record/">Correct The Record</a> publicly admits to astroturfing on Reddit. </p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://www.wired.com/2007/12/clinton-staff-a/">Wired: Clinton Staff and Volunteers Busted for Astroturfing [in 2007]</a></p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/technology-37684418">BBC: More than four times as many tweets were made by automated accounts in favour of Donald Trump around the first US presidential debate as by those backing Hillary Clinton, a study says.</a></p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/56u8vz/new_evidence_of_ctr_on_reddit_from_podesta_emails/?st=izz0om62&amp;amp;sh=ab761d81">Reddit users received talking points from CTR via email and copy pasted those to Reddit before the emails were public, proving they are shilling on Reddit.</a></p></li>
</ul>

<p>That last one isn&#39;t all that surprising. They admitted to it on their own website, but it&#39;s kind of weird they left actual proof behind. </p>

<p>Confessions. These also should not be surprising. If all of these governments and corporations hire shills, some will obviously go online and admit to it. Due to the fact that some people have signed non-disclosure agreements and fear repercussions, most confessions don&#39;t come with proof of identity. I&#39;m not going to fluff this evidence up and make it something it&#39;s not. Some could be trolls for all we know. Make up your own mind for each one. </p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/shills/comments/5pzcnx/shill_confessions_and_additional_information/?st=izz0ga8r&amp;amp;sh=43621acd">Shill Confessions</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Additional information:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><a href="http://www.politico.com/story/2016/11/david-brock-donald-trump-donor-network-231588">Correct the Record is winding down, but David Brock says &quot;a number of its functions and personnel likely will be absorbed by his other groups,&quot; such as ShareBlue.</a></p></li>
<li><p>Leaked Shareblue memo discussing <a href="https://www.scribd.com/document/337535680/Full-David-Brock-Confidential-Memo-On-Fighting-Trump">ways to manipulate the press and social media</a>.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Here they don&#39;t specifically say &quot;we are going to shill on Reddit&quot; like CTR did, but it&#39;s a reasonable conclusion based on reading the memo and the fact that Shareblue and CTR have the same personnel and funders. They probably learned from CTR&#39;s mistake of publicly declaring your specific intentions. </p>

<p>OR</p>

<p>I&#39;m not suddenly going to stop supporting the only man who seems as if he might make a change BEFORE HE DOES ANYTHING TO GIVE US CAUSE TO DOUBT HIM.</p>

<p>Yes, if he suddenly starts talking about gun restrictions, open borders then YES! </p>

I could post about my saggy balls on r/2xchromozones &amp; get more support than from some of the &quot;old guard&quot; here. Maybe instead of your crusade against shills you should look around. Example since this is conspiracy... &quot;is pizza gate simply CTRs way of discrediting this sub &amp; running off casualy intrested people?&quot; It did pop up around the same time &amp; makes utter nonsense.

If I feel up to it Ill usually bat them around a bit with some bullshit rhetoric and they just go nuts. Looking at it from the outside it seems most are extremely paranoid and deluded, much of the time not rationally thinking things through. This is not to say I don&#39;t believe certain things I&#39;m fairly red pilled but many of these people grasp at straws on many things and I believe much of the shill paranoia can be attributed to your run of the mill troll that do it for the lolz cause it sure as hell doesn&#39;t take much.

    <div class="md"><p>Well, we have identified several of their motives (and like I said, having the support and help of you guys would be great on this, chime in).</p>

<p>-disrupt, annoy, clutter any discussions that are disruptive to TPTB</p>

<p>-Push the idea that this discussion platform is dead, and has been taken over by Donald trump supporters, an has morphed into a conservative political echo chamber being repair </p>

<p>-In addition to #2 <sup>,</sup> also make liberals feel unwelcome here, by making many snarky comments attacking the left political ideology</p>

<p>-Push an anti-Jewish narrative, and possibly even a racist narrative </p>

<p>-Show unwavering support for Donald trump, to give the illusion of community support for conservative values.</p>

<p>-disrupt any and all discussion of child sex trafficking by the elite, BURYING &quot;Pizzagate&quot;, and <strong>crediting the trump administration with all of the sex trafficking arrests</strong></p>

<p>We simply need to slap down any attempts to push this shit. Downvoting comments, upvoting GOOD submissions that encourage free thought and non-political views on important news. It&#39;s not that hard, but some of you guys are WAYYY SMARTER than I am, and could help out a LOT. </p>

<p>Also, in b4 someone quotes the way smarter comment and says &quot;that&#39;s for certain&quot;...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, and great question by the way!</p>

<p>This is why.</p>

<p>They allow a small circle of posters to exist here, that try to rally the idea that Trump and Sessions are going to pursue the pedophilia and human trafficking. Most of them are shills, many of the organic posters here know that no credit should be given to trump for any of these recent arrests, and that these arrests are all part of a &quot;limited hangout&quot; anyway, where only small time/mid level busts will happen, leaving the higher ups secure and the integrity of the GLOBAL ring intact and secure. </p>

<p>By allowing posts in support of Donald trump and his administration&#39;s &quot;pursuit of the pedophiles&quot; to reach the front page, it gives the ILLUSION of community support for the new regime,  and makes it seem like the trump administration is earnestly and honestly going to criminally pursue these people (which is total fucking horseshit obviously). </p>

<p>This perfectly makes the sub appear to be a conservative leaning forum, and sets them up for these kind of comments,</p>

<p>&quot;God damnit, this place is such a trump fuck fest...I swear it&#39;s the Donald 2.0 these days&quot;</p>

<p>They want to politiciZe and make this sub appear to be a republican echo chamber. This totally whitewashes our TRUE stance and message of rejecting the two party system; and makes it harder or lurkers and new visitors to take us seriously.</p>

<p>They are essentially doing whatever they can to mesh the &quot;conspiracy culture/community&quot;, which is picking up steam, with conservative and alt right politics. Politicization is a key to keeping your message from reaching the masses. This is how they operate. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Good luck with that. I don&#39;t think you actually understand how the Shilling process works. Its not just getting a group of individuals together and upvoting something. Its also &quot;TEXT&quot; based subterfuge.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve already admitted to being a shill on a post i made here and i can tell you that this sub has been &quot;compromised&quot;. It will never return to how it was prior to the &quot;T_D&quot; coming here.</p>

<p>I actually come to this sub to laugh at whats happening.</p>

<p>I used this account to Shill on r/the donald for 4 months before they banned it. I&#39;m still shilling on r/politics as a liberal and am on r/twoxchromosomes pretending to be female.</p>

<p>What you&#39;re planning on doing will bite you in the ass.</p>

<p>still, good luck </p>

<p>Just makes people sound like immature children, to me. Also, I&#39;ve literally never heard someone use it IRL, ever. It&#39;s like calling people &quot;faggot.&quot; Sounds edgy on the internet, makes you sound like a fucking moron in real life.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh, most definitely. If he would have tried to act like a &quot;professional politician&quot; he would have been ignored by the media.</p>

<p>I honestly believe that Hillary handlers arranged for him to be her opposition, because they thought he was such a clown that no one would actually vote for him. And it backfired on them, which is why their media lap dogs are attacking him incessantly. People forget that Trump ran for president in 2000 as well for the reform party. And if you read his books, he&#39;s had the EXACT same views about politics for decades. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, we have identified several of their motives (and like I said, having the support and help of you guys would be great on this, chime in).</p>

<p>-disrupt, annoy, clutter any discussions that are disruptive to TPTB</p>

<p>-Push the idea that this discussion platform is dead, and has been taken over by Donald trump supporters, an has morphed into a conservative political echo chamber being repair </p>

<p>-In addition to #2 <sup>,</sup> also make liberals feel unwelcome here, by making many snarky comments attacking the left political ideology</p>

<p>-Push an anti-Jewish narrative, and possibly even a racist narrative </p>

<p>-Show unwavering support for Donald trump, to give the illusion of community support for conservative values.</p>

<p>-disrupt any and all discussion of child sex trafficking by the elite, BURYING &quot;Pizzagate&quot;, and <strong>crediting the trump administration with all of the sex trafficking arrests</strong></p>

<p>We simply need to slap down any attempts to push this shit. Downvoting comments, upvoting GOOD submissions that encourage free thought and non-political views on important news. It&#39;s not that hard, but some of you guys are WAYYY SMARTER than I am, and could help out a LOT. </p>

<p>Also, in b4 someone quotes the way smarter comment and says &quot;that&#39;s for certain&quot;...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>All im saying is when someone is spreading disinfo, make a claim and post a source that refutes it. If someone makes a post that attributes the sex trafficking arrests to trump&#39;s presidency, remind them there is no evidence to support that he has even ACKNOWLEDGED our investigation, let alone criminally pursuing elite pedophiles.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Political bots exist. That&#39;s already a fact. This was they decide to estimate the ones supporting trump and Hillary. Normal people don&#39;t tweet 50 times a day, so it&#39;s weird that there is a cluster of these abnormal people who tweet about a politician. </p>
