    <div class="md"><p>Bernie Sanders was a true left. He was a socialist through and through, a champion of the people! He has the history to back it up, too.</p>

<p>But the DMC showed their true values when they pointedly ignored him, denied him any media coverage at all despite his campaign being surprisingly popular all the while, promoted solely online through social media and the like. Hillary was instead given the spotlight, and unsuccessfully made to seem appealing.</p>

<p>The people were so desperate for a change, they elected Donald Trump, an egotistical sociopath who&#39;s best friends with Russia, who denies climate change, who can&#39;t actually run a company despite his claims (he would have made more money through investing that loan, has run numerous corporations into the ground after buying or making them, and his biggest sources of income are a &#39;university&#39; that takes your money and gives you nothing in return and various golf courses and the like designed to extort money from the rest of the 1%).</p>

<p>They wanted change. Whether they were fed up with the Republicans never delivering on their promises or just didn&#39;t give a shit anymore, they voted for him.</p>

<p>Sanders would have won, had he been given a chance. Instead, the DMC threw the race in a vain effort to put another puppet in the white house. Now we have a wild card who only gives a shit about lining his own pockets and has zero idea how to actually do his job.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The Establicrats are overplaying how much the hacking affected the election.  Their livelihoods moving forward depend on the idea that Clinton was a &quot;good candidate&quot; who was screwed and their ideology is popular and sound.  It also takes the heat off of the content of the emails which were disturbing.</p>

<p>Yet, there is something to the relationship between the Trump campaign and Putin that the hacking story is the window into, the same way that Benghazi was the window into the illegal Clinton email server story.  The Russian ambassador meets with several Trump campaign officials in the lead-up to the Republican Convention, and then all of a sudden, the Trump campaign gets some language about defending Ukraine from the Russian backed insurgency pulled from the party platform?  Christopher Steele&#39;s salacious dossier goes public and within the next two months half a dozen high ranking Russian Government officials turn up dead?  The NSA has already been forced to resign after lying to the Vice President about his meetings with Russian officials, meetings that the President was breifed on weeks before?</p>

<p>There&#39;s a fuckton of smoke for no fire here.</p>

No, you&#39;re sitting here trying to figure out what&#39;s true like the rest of us. But I know inherently trusting the state to tell the truth is a slippery slope.

<p>Please learn to notice when you are about to talk out of your ass and stop doing it.</p>

<p>That&#39;s aside from the fact that your argument is just dumb. Oh wow! Countries work when they have economic activity and they stop working when they don&#39;t? Geez, I never would have thought! /s Economic activity is economic activity. It doesn&#39;t matter if it&#39;s achieved through natural resources, manufacturing, tourism, technologies or whatever. It generates revenue for the state.</p>

<p>Venezuela was too dumb to invest to diversify their economy when they had the money. Same thing has happened with Alberta in Canada which is a province that relied heavily on oil. Scandinavian countries don&#39;t have that issue. They are smart enough to invest in other sectors of their economy before their natural resources run out.</p>

<p>Why is everything &quot;the left&quot; does so fake?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It is mostly the MSM, and now astroturfing efforts that are fake.</p>

<p>If you look at the size of Sanders following, a very big part of the left are actual real progressives concerned about economic justice both as a major left issue in itself, as well as a solution to many social injustices.</p>

<p>But MSM and astroturfing efforts only give voice to Trump hate and social justice talk completely devoid of any attempt to make a connection with economic justice.</p>

<p>This serves both as a way to make left look silly to the right and re-enforce the divide, as well as an attempt to change the way the left thinks of itself.</p>

<p>It is disgusting, but the silver lining is that they&#39;ve been trying too hard during last election season and now it looks even more idiotic because at least during election season they had a candidate to promote. Now it is hate-hate-hate every time all the time.</p>

<p>It is backfiring. At least with people paying attention, the kind of people who actually vote and influence others.</p>

Of course, the point of the MSM and astro turfing, is to make democrats look good and the republicans look bad.  The problem is,  the DNC no longer represents leftist causes.

<p>Yep. They lost because they let Trump be the only one saying he was for the workers, saying he was going to protect social services, etc. It&#39;s so weird, in 2016 while Trump was praising universal healthcare and saying we need it here, Clinton was out there bragging about how single payer healthcare will &quot;never ever come to pass&quot;. So fucking stupid, the Democrats aren&#39;t even willing to lie to the people like Obama did in order to get their votes. The only rational explanation I can offer is that they don&#39;t actually want to win. </p>

<p>There is a lot more left leaning redditors who hate Trump so I can see why they have more dedicated anti trump subs. I usually avoid all these places as they don&#39;t usually allow any dissenting opinions. </p>

<p>I personally find it more valuable to talk to one person who disagrees with me than 10 that do. Those who only surround themselves with like minded people will be forever ignorant. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The corporate overlords who control Reddit want to keep the site going as a containment vessel where shills and bots can pepper the poor souls who find themselves here with propaganda on any politically oriented subject.

<p>If they knew the truth, why would any sane user of such an abominable site continue staying here?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Boy, did he let so many people down. And i hear that from a lot of Democrats. Obama has to be one of the worst presidents in the last few decades; the scandals, secrets, and cover ups were too much. Its insane how people perceive someone with the media on his side compared to the media being against someone. Trump smashed the media in the mouth and proved for the first time that the big MSM bully could be taken down and defeated. Also, your statement wasnt true, people really started hating Donald Trump after he announced he was running for POTUS, people actually loved him before that. And if Hillary had won, it would be an absolute disaster for the USA, she has done so many horrible things, thank God she lost.</p>

<p>I&#39;m a good judge of character. Obama isn&#39;t an asshole. Even Bush doesn&#39;t appear to be an asshole (I was a little too young to care about US politics pre 2008). Hillary though, has fakeness written all over her face. Wouldn&#39;t trust her. Trump is a petty buffoon. Don&#39;t trust him either. But the fact that shit things happened under the presidency of what appears to be very fine people really makes me doubt that they have as much as say in things as their position suggests. Or as powerful as they are, they are still human and amenable to suggestion and manipulation. Plus we never really, really know the real reasons they are doing things. Like yeah we can posit that the whole war about WMD was really about oil interests. But we don&#39;t know if that&#39;s how it was presented to Bush back then.</p>

<p>I didn&#39;t and would never vote for the guy, but i find myself playing Devil&#39;s advocate on his behalf just to be fair.  The overwhelming majority of the time, those in a frenzy about something Trump did were totally silent when Obama or Clinton were doing something comparable.  You&#39;ll get no argument from me about Trump&#39;s damage to civil liberties, but the pundits/media outlets complaining the loudest haven&#39;t said a word on NoDAPL/Standing Rock.

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s pretty easy to just look objectively at what a goddamn baffoon clown child he is and hate him for that. </p>

<p>I hated his stupid lying ass when he was an idiot fake billionaire host of a shitty reality TV show. </p>

<p>Hated him when he was jerking his Twitter off over Obama&#39;s birthplace and then pretended he never did any of that, even though the tweets are still there. </p>

<p>Hated him for his idiotic scam products that he&#39;d slap his gaudy golden font name on and shill for them until they failed, then he&#39;d like and say he never cared about them and other people fucked up. </p>

<p>He doesn&#39;t need any media pieces to convince me he&#39;s an asshole. He did a fine job of that himself when he took out a newspaper ad to convince a couple men of a crime in the court of public opinion and then never apologized when he was wrong. Asshole still won&#39;t admit he was wrong. </p>

<p>So stop this bullshit that you either love him OR the media told you to hate him. There are a billion examples of what a shit he was before he ever even suggested he was going to run for President. I&#39;m talking about things from thirty years ago. </p>

<p>This is such a shit argument. Trump has low likability ratings, yes.. but he also has higher ratings for the things he&#39;s actually doing. Most Americans, believe it or not, agree with his travel ban. More people think he&#39;ll change the country for the better than for the worse. </p>

<p>Those are just two examples. This overall &quot;approval/likability&quot; rating is kind of pointless. Who cares if someone approves of Trump the man, what matters is if what he&#39;s doing for the nation is what the nation wants him to do. And so far, it seems like it is. </p>

<p>Do you approve or disapprove of the way Donald Trump is handling his job as president?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>On that metric, Trump currently has a 51% disapproval, twice the disapproval of Obama at the same time in 2009.</p>

<p>Support for the immigration ban is a bit uncertain, polls are split:

    <div class="md"><p>That question is very vague, which was my point. You gotta look at the more specific questions about specific policies and more pointed questions, such as the direction of the nation. </p>

<p>As I said, &quot;handling his job as president&quot; can be interpreted numerous different ways. As a trump voter and a big supporter, I&#39;d actually answer no to that question. While I enjoy his tweets, I think that is a bad way to handle the office. The same goes for his constant attacks on Clinton. I love them but I don&#39;t think that&#39;s what the president should be wasting breath on. </p>

<p>With that said, I do think he&#39;s doing good things for the nation. I like most of his policy proposals and EOs (as much as one can like EOs). My overall approval rating for him would be rather high. </p>

<p>Well, the travel ban yielded split polls, as I posted above. When the ban was worded more specifically by mentioning the timing disapproval was more likely.</p>

<p>And if we want to get even more specific, more Americans think Trump&#39;s EO <strong>Increases</strong> the chance of a terrorist attack than decreases. Even among Republicans who support him bigly, only half think the EO decreases the chance of a terrorist attack.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.people-press.org/2017/02/16/in-first-month-views-of-trump-are-already-strongly-felt-deeply-polarized/2_3-10/">http://www.people-press.org/2017/02/16/in-first-month-views-of-trump-are-already-strongly-felt-deeply-polarized/2_3-10/</a></p>

<p>I can&#39;t find any major poll that shows majority support for the wall.</p>

<p>A majority oppose ACA repeal.</p>

<p>A majority oppose repealing regulations designed to fight global warming.</p>

<p>People DO see him as someone who keeps his promises, but I don&#39;t see any data that suggests a majority actually wants him to.</p>

<p>I just don&#39;t see polls that support what you&#39;re saying, but if there&#39;s some I haven&#39;t found I&#39;d like to see them.</p>

<p>All that said, the OP and most of this thread was about antipathy towards Trump, and the broad question of approval rating is enough to show that people don&#39;t like him. The Pew studies also show that those who don&#39;t like him are very likely to feel that strongly.</p>

I dont want a president to run for office and only have to speak in NYC, LA, Chicago, and Houston.

He was pretty popular his first couple of months with a 68% approval rating. Even when he started to fuck up with wiretapping and drone strikes he remained neutral to most redditors so not enough anger to create multi anti-obama subs. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You make an excellent point regarding the forces agenda being DNC and not left leaning. I would venture that about 70% of my legitimate friends (not acquaintances) are left leaning and we are always able to discuss politics with civility. The forced DNC motive is increasingly more apparent than ever before and it greatly inhibits honest opinions without ridicule.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>LMFAO yes they absolutely are! Theyve both been caught lying an insane amount of times since the beginning of the election cycle. Along with many other media organizations. The fact that you think only the POTUS thinks they&#39;re terribly fake is also pretty insane, it&#39;s known to everyone outside of r/politics to be extremely left-wing biased media that has been caught lying and selectively editing many of their articles. Look more into it, theres tons of proof and evidence and it just shows you how biased the MSM is nowadays and what little they do to hide it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Basically everything, from his tendency to use superlatives all the damn time (I am the best wall builder / I&#39;m the best with women / etc), which are just weird and dumb and really only just confirm his Narcissistic Personality Disorder. To the things where he is hopefully just ignorant about, like thinking that enacting a tariff would help the US economy or about how the American economy is basically Greece on steroids. Things which if he asked any economist, and paid attention to their answer, he might learn a thing or two about how amazingly wrong he is. </p>

<p>I could go on and on. He blames Obama for the mess he&#39;s inherited, but most of the jobs that have been created so far are due to his policies. Not that they&#39;re anything special, just that they are the tail-end of things that happened in Obama&#39;s term. He praised almost 230k jobs created in January as his work, but either he&#39;s stupid or he&#39;s lying or he&#39;s just in it for the media spin, because that was Obama&#39;s work. The wall and other immigration issues will only hurt the economy, but really these aren&#39;t economic fixes, they&#39;re feel good fixes. They&#39;re for the closet racists of America who think to &#39;Make America Great Again&#39; we need to &#39;Make America White Again&#39;. He wants to capture the feeling of America after WW2, but little does he know that the job and housing boom during this period was in part due to some pretty high taxes. </p>

<p>How about the &#39;terrorism threat&#39; from people who come over our border, when almost every single &#39;threat&#39; over the past few years was either planted by the FBI or a homegrown white supremacist who has gone crazy on his own, or now has gone crazy because of the Trumpian rhetoric of hate and racism. </p>

<p>Essentially, when he says things like, &quot;Nobody reads the Bible more than me&quot; / &quot;Nobody knows the system better than I do.&quot; / &quot;Nobody understands the horror of nuclear more than me.&quot; it&#39;s so obvious how he&#39;s just grandstanding that it simply cannot be true. Especially how he says he knows the system, but then things he says show how he has barely a grasp on how it works, let alone what some of the key acronyms even mean. </p>

<p>He&#39;s a moron, pure and simple. And many of my fellow Americans have been duped by him, just like so many got duped by Obama. Because they think he&#39;ll be a breath of fresh air into the stangnant and disgusting Washington Swamp. Which, of course, he&#39;s going to drain by hiring Wall Street cronies and others of the 1%.</p>

<p>I dont even remember him ever saying our economy is basically Greece on steroids? well ok. </p>

<p>Well I must say this comment is about as ignorant and assholish as you get. </p>

<p>As for paying attention? Maybe you need to get out of your hugbox, Hillary literally fucked all Democrats over. You don&#39;t give a shit though. </p>

<p>The same people who fund her and funding coups in other countries INCLUDING THIS ONE. You want a person like that for president? Do you not see the corruption? </p>

<p>Why the fuck are you in the conspiracy sub when you really believe everything the media tells you? </p>

<p>Holy shit you dumbass.. You need to think for yourself. The media is LYING TO YOU. They want you to ignore everything the DNC is doing while casting aspersions on the Trump campaign. 75% of the opposition is paid for, its a way to divide the country. </p>

<p>Why? Clinton lost and the corrupt are scared. You want to defend the corruption to keep hold of the Obama status quo? </p>

<p>Just stop. You aren&#39;t intelligent or informed. You just think Dems good = Trump bad = Nazi. </p>

<p>Maybe you should have been around when the DNCleaks were going on. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>While i am sure that these shill sites are seeding the internet. You must remember that trump remains highly unpopular especially with the average dem of reddit user. It might be easy to fall into an echo chamber and think everything is fine but regardless what shills say he is not well liked. I think what is more damaging is the divisions we are seeing not only on reddit but in society as a whole. I think these paid shills exist on both sides to further exasperate the divisions and troll people. People need to realize that trump clinton ctr are all on the same side its all about the money. People are just manufacturing fake outrage and anger against opposing viewpoint.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I live in the UK and I hate going on r/all there&#39;s constantly atleast 3 related articles bashing him for things that shouldn&#39;t even reach the Trump hate subreddits it lacks any substance, it&#39;s normally taken out of context and could be put on the same level as clickbait where if you invested 5minutes of your time you can find out they really dramatiscized it or took it out of context, the only two things I disagree with Trump on is getting the Feds involved in legal marijuana and the mission which a soldier lost his life, the weird things are the comments they are so anti trump always making fun of r/thedonald the people there actually seem to like Trump instead of just preferring him to Hilary which I find crazy how anyone can genuinely like the guy but they are nowhere near as crazy as the pro Hilary lot, to support Hilary you gotta be one of those people that do literally 0 fact checking.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t like Trump I think he&#39;s a smug egotistical cunt, but I think wayyyyy worse of Hilary and for that reason would of voted for Trump or maybe some 3rd party candidate but I was so passionate in my hate for the Clinton&#39;s that I probably would have voted Trump.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Why would anyone believe a poll after the election predictions? For me a certain degree of bias has always been evident in the press, sure it has become more blatant, but it was always there. And we&#39;ve got the lying press game news narrative. But there&#39;s nothing about the polls. Nothing. All the main polling organisations had Hillary clearly in front. It was going to be a near double digit drubbing. How could they all have got it so wrong? I&#39;ve said it before, the only two answers to why, is that they are all inept or are all complicit in spreading a biased narrative. </p>

<p>I post anti trump stuff constantly not because I&#39;m paid to, but because he is a fucking terrible president. I know hundreds of people personally that do that same thing on their various social media networks, for the same reason. I think it is entirely possibly that this is a situation that happened on its own. He is terrible. He lies, he implicates the press(they&#39;re not great but they&#39;re not any worse then they have always been). </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Lmao. He has been president a little over a month and a half. It&#39;s not possible for any president to be &quot;good&quot; yet. He has repealed numerous common sense laws, like not dumping coal waste into our fucking streams, for one. He lies, constantly - when there is video proof of the lie. There is audio of him bragging about barging in on young, undressed girls because he &quot;can get away with it&quot; due to the fact that he ran the pageants. He takes credit for shit he had nothing to do with. Anyone with any amount of sense knows he is terrible. Most people, including my own family, voted for him because he wasn&#39;t hillary. I would have never voted Hillary, but I damn sure wouldn&#39;t vote trump. One is the stereotypical slimy secretive backstabbing politician, the other is a slimy, money grabbing, lie to your face and fuck over everyone because his ego is the only thing that matters type. </p>

<p>And no Obama wasn&#39;t the best president, he did lots of shady shit. But he did care about the environment, or at least passed legislature that protected it. </p>

<p>Or is climate change a conspiracy too? </p>

<p>And you are an idiot if you believe he is allowing coal to be dumped in water. He deregulated the carbon emissions for several industries. Nothing in that allows the dumping of pollutants in the water.</p>

<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>

<p>Undressed girls? You mean adult females? Your spin is weak.</p>

<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>

<p>And Obama didn&#39;t care about the environment as much as you imply. If he did, he wouldn&#39;t push the extremely toxic to manufacture photovoltaic products. But then, most on reddit don&#39;t care to put effort into knowing what they are talking about.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Personally, I&#39;m even more shocked about the flood of pro-45th potus subreddits and users that have appeared in the last year. </p>

<p>According to all metrics, reddit has been heavily left leaning since its inception, and all of that changed around summer last year. </p>

<p>And it can&#39;t be explained away by simple growth. </p>

<p>Lastly: there was a post on how almost all of the frontpage pro-45th material submitted during the early growth was all created by a handful of new users. </p>

<p>Forum sliding at its best ladies and gents. </p>

<p>And now we have jokers like OP trying to revise reddit history. </p>

<p>And don&#39;t for a second think I&#39;m denying shareblue&#39;s involvement. Their blatant acts to support a toxic candidate is part of what is ruining reddit. </p>

<p>I hate shills of all kinds, and only an idiot would think that just one side is trying to manipulate consensus. </p>

<p>Even this sub has become infected by both red and blue shills, and for some godawful reason it seems red won here. </p>

<p>I really have no fucking clue how that is even possible, we&#39;re supposed to be free thinkers, not the sheep we so despise. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Lmao. He has been president a little over a month and a half. It&#39;s not possible for any president to be &quot;good&quot; yet. He has repealed numerous common sense laws, like not dumping coal waste into our fucking streams, for one. He lies, constantly - when there is video proof of the lie. There is audio of him bragging about barging in on young, undressed girls because he &quot;can get away with it&quot; due to the fact that he ran the pageants. He takes credit for shit he had nothing to do with. Anyone with any amount of sense knows he is terrible. Most people, including my own family, voted for him because he wasn&#39;t hillary. I would have never voted Hillary, but I damn sure wouldn&#39;t vote trump. One is the stereotypical slimy secretive backstabbing politician, the other is a slimy, money grabbing, lie to your face and fuck over everyone because his ego is the only thing that matters type. </p>

<p>And no Obama wasn&#39;t the best president, he did lots of shady shit. But he did care about the environment, or at least passed legislature that protected it. </p>

<p>Or is climate change a conspiracy too? </p>
