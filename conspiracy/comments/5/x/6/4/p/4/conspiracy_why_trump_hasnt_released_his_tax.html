        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>It&#39;s been mooted that the reason Trump is so cagey about his taxes isn&#39;t that people will realise he isn&#39;t a billionaire (a lot of people in his business probably already know that), but because there&#39;s a lot of Russian ties, which mean a lot of ties to Putin. This will likely not be incriminating, but Trump believes people will take it the wrong way. Hence the ham-fisted cover-up. And because so many people are caught up in this web, this thing will just run and run. Too many people close to Trump are on record as saying that they&#39;ve never had any dealings whatsoever with any Russian officials. </p>

<p>The whole thing is fishy. Far too many people are being less than honest about meeting Russians, and you really have to ask why? It&#39;s not as if it&#39;s illegal to meet Russian officials. In fact, it&#39;s perfectly sensible to do so. On the other side, the mere whiff of a Russian sends the MSM, the Democratic establishment and certain senior Republicans into meltdown and hysterical cries of &quot;treason&quot;, &quot;Kremlin agent&quot; or &quot;Putin stooge&quot; are heard.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>the problem is was there collusion between the Trump campaign and the Russians.</p>

<p>I think meeting them is not a problem after getting elected, but meeting them before the election was over was iffy at best.</p>
</div>

    <p class="byline text-muted mb-0"><a href="javascript:;" class="score"><span class="badge badge-secondary">n/a</span></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a class="author" href="../../../../../../../../user/Chimp444.html">Chimp444</a> 2017-03-02</p>
    <div class="md"><p>But there was in fact nothing secret about either of Jeff Sessions’s meetings with the Russian ambassador, only one of which was held in private.  It is not disputed that Sessions on both occasions met with the ambassador in his official capacity as a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee.  There was nothing irregular about these meetings, Sessions insists that the Trump campaign was not discussed over the course of either of these meetings, and there is no reason to doubt his word.</p>

<p>It has been suggested that Sessions misled the Senate during his confirmation hearings by denying contacts with the Russians during the election campaign.</p>

<p>There are two occasions when this is supposed to have happened.  The first was during a Senate hearing on 10th January 2017 when Sessions was asked how he would respond if he learned of communications between members of the Trump campaign and Russian officials during the election.  He replied as follows</p>

<p>I have been called <em>a surrogate at a time or two in that campaign</em> and I did not have communications with the Russians
(bold italics added)</p>

<p>The second occasion was in a response to a written question put to him in a questionnaire prepared by Senator Patrick Leahy.  The question and Sessions’s answer read as follows</p>

<p>Several of the President-Elect’s nominees or senior advisers have Russian ties. Have you been in contact with anyone connected to any part of the Russian government <em>about the 2016 election</em>, either before or after election day?
RESPONSE: No.
(bold italics added)</p>

<p>It is clear that both questions concerned contacts with the Russians in relation to the election campaign and carried out on behalf of the Trump campaign.  Sessions denied having contacts with the Russians in relation to the election campaign or on behalf of the Trump campaign.  Since his meetings with the Russian ambassador did not concern the election campaign and were not undertaken on behalf of the Trump campaign Sessions told the Senate the truth.</p>

<p>It has been suggested that Sessions should have volunteered information about his two meetings with Kislyak even though these took place whilst he was working in an official capacity as a United States Senator and a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, and even though these meetings had nothing to do with the election campaign or the Trump campaign.  Given the fevered atmosphere involving any contacts with Russians at all, however routine or innocuous they might be, perhaps it would have been better had he done so.</p>

<p>Having said this, since no one is disputing that the meetings took place as part of Sessions’s work as a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, it is nothing short of bizarre as well as being frankly sinister that no less a person than a United States Senator is now being called upon to volunteer information about routine aspects of his work in order to avoid suspicion.</p>

<p>the russia thing is moot because it&#39;s already being insinuated he&#39;s a russian puppet handpicked and installed by putin himself. everyone has made up their minds regarding russia. russianconnections in his taxes aren&#39;t going to change anyone&#39;s mind at this point.</p>

<p>if there was a real problem, the IRS would be handling it themselves. even al kapone found out you don&#39;t fuck with the IRS. fwiw the post office is pretty serious too. my neighbor was putting notes in my mailbox saying he was going to kill my cat, i told my mail carrier, and that cat hating POS got charged with a felony for tampering with a mailbox.</p>

Good looking
Well liked
Cool Headed
Takes Direction Well
Articulate
Speaks Russian (I don&#39;t know for a fact that Trump doesn&#39;t, but he can barely speak English at times so it&#39;s a safe assumption)
Diplomatic</p>

<p>Pretty much the opposite of Trump</p>

<p>The only person that had a worse chance of winning the election must have literally been Hillary Clinton. Many people would have rather voted for neither of them then have to pick one of them. Not the type of odds you want to bet on. </p>

<p>If I hired a consulting firm to help me pick a puppet to overthrow the United States government and they suggested Donald Trump, I would fire then immediately, on the spot... and probably report them to the Better Business Bureau. </p>

<p>Somewhat reminiscent of the &quot;Vote Your Conscience&quot; movement to pressure electoral college voters into betraying their oaths.

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s amazing to me that on a subreddit called <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>, most of the commenters here seem to be saying that there&#39;s nothing interesting about the tax returns of the richest POTUS in history, and how that POTUS is the only one in modern times to refuse ot release his tax returns.</p>

<p>Seems pretty odd that the same people who never seem to trust the government about anything are suddenly so quick to say, &quot;oh nothing to see here, i&#39;m sure trump has nothing to hide but just doesn&#39;t want to feed the opposition.&quot;</p>

<p>I doubt the tax returns are little more than a cheat sheet for a qualified forensic accountant. If tax returns were so important to uncovering fraud or other financial crimes, it would be much easier to illegally hide earnings.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I just remember reading something like that but I can&#39;t find it... I think it&#39;s not the fault of the individual to exploit tax loop holes, it kind of sucks but it&#39;s the fault of the tax code.</p>
