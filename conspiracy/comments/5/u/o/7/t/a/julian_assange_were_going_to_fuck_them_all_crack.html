<p>Edit: I think I should have clarified by saying that this quote is from We Steal Secrets which came out in 2013. This isn&#39;t a new Assange statement so don&#39;t be disappointed if they don&#39;t drop anything... but if I remember correctly Feb 19 might be the day we get the info on Vault 7... not getting my hopes up but that would be prettttty sweet. </p>

<p>How is he going to do that without NSA listening in? See the problem</p>

<p>Its a game of strategy. For example he leaked DNC stuff slow to ruin Hillary cause if she won it would have been another vicious globalist puppet screwing the country. And now, there are other factors going on: deepstate/mossad/Saudi&#39;s/MSM Propagnada/PedoGate and all sorts of stuff, he has to pick his releases wisely</p>

<p>My point exactly...</p>

<p>Hillary might be shady as fuck, but she can comport herself in the manner befitting the POTUS. Instead, we get twitter rants, a white supremacist as an adviser, along with a cabinet full of so much conflicted interests its gone way beyond irony. He tweets like a petulant child, willing to be drawn into the most childish disagreements. He still has the Spice Worm arguing that his inauguration crown &quot;was like, wayyyyy bigger than anyone elses. Also Hillary rigged the election.&quot;</p>

<p>Political viewpoints aside, what we&#39;ve seen of trump thusfar are not the actions of someone who has a clean bill of mental health. Listen, I was admitedly happy when I heard he won, hoping against hope that he would drop his &#39;
campaign persona&#39; and do a great job running the country. It became immediately apparent however, that what many mistook for a persona was, in reality how he is. He clearly suffers from Narcissistic PD. He became addicted to holding his rallies and hearing people cheering his name. In fact, he&#39;s holding another one in the upcoming week! I wish it were different man, I really do, but he is so far out of his depth, and it&#39;s becoming increasingly more obvious. </p>

<p>This doesn&#39;t even touch upon Russia, Flynn, lies lies and more lies, as well as the debacle at the airports, trying to deny entry to people with greencards. But according to God Emperor Cheeto II, it was flawless. A well oiled machine.... And the SCARIEST PART, anyone who says otherwise is spreading &#39;FAKE NEWS&#39; trying to make him look bad. All those polls about 55% of the country strongly disapproving of his actions thus far? FAKE NEWS. I honestly believe that&#39;s the only way his fragile ego can remain intact.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There is no God. 
Authority is an illusion.
Governments exist to make money off the people and keep them from uprising. 
Money is an illusion, a trick played on us all. 
Some agency, somewhere, has records of everything you&#39;ve ever done or said on the phone or online. 
This is the only life we have, and we let soulless old rich men set policies that effect us but not them. 
The police exist as the strong arm of the government. 
The water we drink has unnatural additives that mess with out brain chemistry, much like our food.
We have been conditioned to think we are in competition with one another, but the elites have long known that when the people work together and take care of each other, we have no need for their version of authority. 
The wars that we fight in are really about population control, money, and resources.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Of course there isn&#39;t. </p>

<p>But you know what? </p>

<p>Religions and ideologies that claim things such as the existence of souls were created by charlatans who didn&#39;t believe their own bullshit and sold it to everyone else who eagerly bought it because it justified their existence. It gave them meaning and saved them from nihilism. </p>

<p>So for the sake of pragmatism- is it better to believe in such things, or not?</p>

<p>Well the people the people who don&#39;t believe- the nihilists- are the ones running the world. The people who do believe are their pets. And there IS PLENTY of evidence to support that.</p>

<p>It&#39;s like gravity. You do realize that gravity is just a theory? We can&#39;t prove gravity does or doesn&#39;t exist, at least not at this point. But the functionally practical thing based on all evidence we do have is to work as though gravity <em>does</em> indeed exist.</p>

<p>We can&#39;t prove souls do or don&#39;t exist but what we can do is look at the people claiming to have proof to know that they exist and we can look at the evidence they. As you said, there is no evidence they do. And there is evidence that they people who want to claim they exist are charlatans.</p>

<p>With this knowledge it&#39;s more pragmatic to go through life as if it&#39;s the only one you&#39;ll ever have. Waiting for a better existence after life is exactly what keeps people from making the biggest impact they can in <em>this</em> one.</p>

<p>First and foremost, &quot;Theory&quot; in scientific contexts does not mean &quot;hypothesis&quot; like it does in layman usage.  A scientific theory is a rigorous model which aligns with experimental observations and makes accurate predictions.  Nothing in science gets the label &quot;Theory of X&quot; without a mountain of supporting data.</p>

<p>Furthermore, you&#39;re not even right in saying gravity is &quot;just a theory&quot;.  Gravity is a natural law.  We directly observe the effects of gravity literally everywhere we look in the universe, from things falling out of our hands to the movements of heavenly bodies.  We have even correctly predicted that gravity affects the path of a beam of light, and a wealth of observation backs that prediction.</p>

<p>What is a theory - and not &quot;just&quot; a theory, mind you - is the Theory of Gravitation, which is our explanatory model for how gravity works.  So far we have not been able to disprove this model.  There is still the matter of directly observing a force mediator for gravity, as all other known fundamental forces are mediated by some particle, but the current model is backed by so much experimental data that it is highly unlikely that it will ever be overturned, only modified.  Even still, the finite probability that the model may be overturned by some radical observation doesn&#39;t change the fact that the phenomenon of gravity itself is a natural law, not a theory.</p>

<p>In closing, read a book.</p>

<p>You literally don&#39;t.  You&#39;re trying to claim gravity is a theory.  It isn&#39;t.  It&#39;s a natural law.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>This has to be the single biggest bullshit backpedal I have ever seen on this site.  &quot;Uhhhh clearly I was talking about this tying I never mentioned nor alluded to that can not in any way be inferred from the text of my post!&quot;</p>

<p>In any case, GR is so well-supported that even if that&#39;s what you meant (it wasn&#39;t), you&#39;d still be wrong in the argument &quot;it&#39;s <em>just</em> a theory!  We can&#39;t know!&quot; because its predicated upon a complete misunderstanding of what a theory is in scientific contexts.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Missed a big one: The true shape of the plane-t. Sounds fucking ridic but all you need to do is just a little research with an open mind. Forget the indoctrination, the mind control since birth. Globes are pushed on us even before we can read. Symbols are power and we are run by occultist who know this. I offer one proof and it should be enough evidence for YOU to do your own research. No matter how high you go on the plane, the horizon always stays flat and stays at eye level. This is it. This is the only evidence anyone should need. This is an impossibility on a sphere. If we believe the ancients had higher technology and a better understanding of our world then why not believe them on this? Egyptians, mayans, they all knew it. Before you call me retarded, stupid, imbecile, look for yourself. Search weather balloon flights on YouTube. Make sure that they are not using a fish eye lenses. Even if they do use a fish eye, the horizon with flex. It will go from concave, to flat, to convex and back again. This is only possible with a straight line. I never thought I&#39;d say this publicly, but search it for yourself if you think I&#39;m wrong. And again, remember that the globe symbol goes deep in you. All the way back to birth. Keep an eye out and check out how often you see it. It is pushed on us from everywhere. </p>

<p>Also, there is a lot of misinformation out there to keep you off track. The flat earth society is just that. You find one piece that doesn&#39;t fit or isn&#39;t right and you say, see! This is bullshit! And you go back to your old way of thinking. This is a psy-op on a massive scale. Yes there are holes, no I have no clue what the model of our world really looks like. But I do know what I&#39;ve researched. Operation high jump, operation fishbowl, Antarctica being off limits, multiple countries (including US &amp; Russia) signing a treaty to keep Antarctica off limits during the Cold War, Russia &amp; the US sending nuclear warheads straight up for something like 5 years. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not talking about passenger airliners. Look at high altitude weather balloons. There are videos on YouTube where they get up to 121k feet. By simple geometry that should be enough height to see the curve. There isn&#39;t one. It&#39;s perfectly straight. Or, if you do see a curve it&#39;ll flex. Going from concave, to straight, to convex and back and forth. The only way that is possible is with a straight line. In fact, if you take the high altitude Red Bull jump video and compare it side by side with a weather balloon video at the same altitude you can clearly see manipulation. Fish eye lenses work wonders for creating curves</p>

<p>Why would &quot;they&quot; work so diligently and tirelessly to keep the entirety of humanity convinced that the world is round? What purpose would it serve?</p>

<p>The wikileaks twitter tweeted on 8th october, at the beginning of their release that &quot;We have published 1% of the #PodestaEmails so far. Additional publications will proceed throughout the election period.&quot;</p>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/wikileaks/status/784787441437859840">https://twitter.com/wikileaks/status/784787441437859840</a></p>

<p>On 8th oct there was only 4146 emails released - if such is 1%, then 100% is <strong>414600.</strong></p>

    <div class="md"><p>Why would the CIA even kill Assange? Let&#39;s say the CIA hates leaks - seems reasonable enough - and hates leakers in particular. The last thing they&#39;d want to do is kill Assange or do away with Wikileaks. Someone might replace it with some sort of transparent, anonymous, open-source solution. Instead, we&#39;ve got Assange and Wikileaks - people subject to criticism, people with agendas, no transparency, one well-known organization to monitor diligently, etc. Assange and Wikileaks present an opportunity to governments around the world - leaks are going to happen, may as well know who is most likely to receive them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah but - consider the other highly likely possibility at the time:  all that mess was created in order to make Julian Assange seem less credible by making it seem like he was compromised/captured.  That was done so at a critical time when the integrity of wikileaks was hugely important.  As he puts it (and as was said at the time by other conspirators) it was a &quot;black PR campaign&quot;, and one which he had no control over (no ability to definitively give proof that couldn&#39;t be countered by black-PR trolls that didn&#39;t involve him having an active internet connection for live-streaming).  There&#39;s a strong case for a group associated with the Clintons cutting his internet and causing all that mess in order to discredit him at a critical time - for little consequence (nothing illegal or dangerous PR e.g. killing him).  It was an easy win - all the discrediting, minus the martydom.  Once he&#39;s finally back, all people can whine about is how the poor guy didn&#39;t have internet for a few months.  Big human rights complaint, there.</p>

<p>I dunno.  With the livestream, I&#39;m convinced he&#39;s alive and well.  <em>Maybe</em> compromised still, but... eh, he always could have been.  He continues to say and do important things, that&#39;s all anyone can hope for.</p>

<p>But disinformation is disinformation, and it&#39;s always harmful. Saying he was standing, saying there was a table. Wtf? And that post had UPVOTES.

<p>And by the way, I get that you&#39;re excited, but attributing straw man arguments always makes you look bad to those with decent reading comprehension. Did I say a thing about the RT interview? Or, the overall validity of any interview? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Certainly a strange interview. I just hope assange is OK but naturally I am skeptical.</p>

<p>I suppose an explanation could be, that it&#39;s a small room, limited space in the embassy, and rather than have two of the same chairs in the study, it&#39;s better to have two different chairs. That&#39;s about all I can think of as far as why the interview was filmed like that.</p>

<p>BUT that&#39;s not even to mention all of the other questionable things around Julian. All of it, taken in the context that we have, certainly presents us with a very very odd body of evidence to draw conclusions from.</p>

<p>Look at rogue one and the CGI admiral, that was super expensive, I doubt the government would be able to pull off convincingly what even Lucas arts couldn&#39;t.</p>

<p>Maybe they could make a mask, have someone wear it and create his voice convincingly in software but I work in production and the timeline to pull that off between when Hannity went to London and the interview would be tricky unless they made it well in advance so maybe someone can rewatch it and see what the most recent event he discussed was and extrapolate how much production time they would&#39;ve had to pull something like that off. </p>

<p>I&#39;m skeptical for those reasons. By the was the first one was suspicious as all fuck I don&#39;t know what was going on there.</p>

I did not say his phone was cut off or he had restrictions placed on his calls, I said it&#39;s entirely possible though, as we know he had some serious restrictions. I never defined what they were because I don&#39;t know. I&#39;m also not trying to convince you he was obviously okay. I&#39;m saying he is okay <em>now</em>. At the time I believed something was up, I followed r/WhereIsAssange from the start. It was only after his Live AMA that I was reassured he was okay. And then look back to see it now makes sense what was going on.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Traditional communism was a world of the people and not the elites, though the right (rather astutely in many cases) have always asserted its a big con, the ultimate con, in that it&#39;s a system in which all aspects of life are determined by the &quot;new bourgeois,&quot; usually in dictatorial, monarch-like fashion, and the people must play entirely along or else be destroyed. Freedom = slavery, the dictatorship of the proletariat heavy on the first part. Judging by how Marxism was politically utilized for many years, its detractors had a point. </p>

<p>I guess I&#39;m weary of a claim like Assange&#39;s because it could easily be another form of &quot;control by the people,&quot; this time in the realm of intelligence. We just cannot know if Wikileaks&#39; curation includes withholding or burying submitted information for Assange&#39;s own ends. It&#39;s not that hard to conjure-- a scenario in which one man essentially has the ability to topple governments or systems at will, depending on what he chooses to deploy. I hope I&#39;m not right, that Assange doesn&#39;t view himself as some kind of savior or world-builder in this vein. His power and influence are unparalleled in human history, really. It&#39;s staggering to consider. </p>

<p>Maybe it&#39;s the monopoly of trust Wikileaks has gained over the years, the lack of competition? I don&#39;t know. The world needs whistleblowers more than ever, and it is great to consider a more transparent political planet, even if it has to happen by informational force. We&#39;ll see.</p>

<p>If you really hate Trump</p>

<p>The reaction to Trump doesn&#39;t even compare to the loud conservative wail during the Obama years. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>you really think he&#39;s an idiot and all the other things you call him, why the hysteria?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Believing that your leader is an idiot who may do harm to your country or to the things that you care about is the exact reason anyone would want to protest, create hashtags, T-shirts, etc. BTW, do you realize that conservatives have done all of these things?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>death threats, slander, viciousness?</p>

<p>Those are the sort of things liberals have faced for years -- even more so today when right wingers are declaring liberals and leftists to be enemies of the state.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>don&#39;t ACTUALLY, TRULY believe in your heart of hearts that he is the demon you keep apoplectically insisting he is</p>

<p>Compared to right wingers actually calling Obama a Satan worshiper or an agent of Satan? </p>

<p>BTW, the problem here is that even disagreeing with Trump has become &quot;hate&quot; to people such as you.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>you&#39;re just throwing a fit because you&#39;re FUCKING BRAINWASHED,</p>

<p>You don&#39;t even seem to understand the Trump&#39;s opposition, so I don&#39;t see how you can fucking claim to be a &quot;freed mind&quot; or something if your beliefs are predicated upon cliches and tropes.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Wikileaks claimed that the reason the PGP keys didn&#39;t match because they were signed for the files within the archive, not the archives themselves. That is possible, but it&#39;s not how they did it before. Some people have explained away no release of Phase 3, by saysing something they did release was that..sort of a moving target.</p>

<p>The eye catcher to me though is the Yemen emails. Wikileaks has always said they would never edit the content of any documents, because there would then be no way to verify if ANY of it was real. (would not pass DCIM for one thing) But when they released those emails, they had email addresses like &#39;<a href="mailto:sender@sender.com">sender@sender.com</a>&#39; or no recipient , which CANNOT be the real info. And they were cut in mid sentence many times as well (which could be explained somehow, I guess).</p>

<p>Could have been a corrupted email archive, but the explanation could really be anything.  Very interesting nonetheless.</p>

<p>And if you&#39;re too lazy, 34 journalists who were critical of Putin were killed in Russia, not including journalists killed in other countries or journalists who didnt have sketchy deaths. For comparison two journalists have died in U.S in simular circumstance in the same time frame and three have died in China (EG: that one video where the reporter got shot by a stranger during an interview in public) Not to mention there are far less journalists in Russia than in America, and yet you&#39;re literally 3,000 percent more likely to be murdered as a journalist in Russia. </p>

<p>Judge from actual citizens who love Putin? I&#39;m sorry can you link me a single interview? You&#39;ll also literally find the same thing in North Korea bro, I can link you hundreds of videos of North Koreans crying when their previous leader died and the people of North Korea absolutely &quot;love&quot; their current dictator, doesn&#39;t mean they are right or that they&#39;re just simply lying so they don&#39;t get put on a list. </p>

<p>It also doesn&#39;t seem sketchy how Putin had blatantly overstayed his legal limit as leader? He literally changed the amount of terms you could be president as president and you don&#39;t think that&#39;s dictator like? Not to mention the fact that he blatantly rigs his own elections and murders his opponents. </p>

<p>You can defend Trump, Obama, Hillary or whoever, but the moment you defend Putin is when you cross the line. Please research the history of Putin and what he does before you defend him, interviews with random citizens only will prove my point TBH. You know when Putin came into power he arrested the guy who ran Russias central media companies and forced him to give up the entire company to the government? </p>

<p>The people in Russia love Putin because any journalist who speaks against him is killed, thus discouraging any other person from doing the same. find me a Russian journalist who is critical of Putin, alive and lived in Russia and I&#39;ll legit delete my Reddit account. </p>

See America always talks about Russia infiltrating but it never even dawns on them that America infiltrates pretty much anywhere they please.

<p>Anna Stepanovna Politkovskaya wrote many articles being very critical of Putin, she was assassinated in the elevator of the apartment a few days later. It doesn&#39;t help the fact that 24 other journalists who were MURDERED had extremely critical views and articles of Putin.</p>

My thoughts are: maybe there is an abundance of land and resources beyond Antarctica. Like what admiral Byrd talked about. Or to hide our divinity? To worship science instead of realizing that we are &quot;god.&quot; That we have more power then anyone could ever dream? To make us feel small, insignificant &amp; alone. To play god? Pillage the earth, change/splice DNA, create hybrids, to try to imitate the creator? I don&#39;t know. I am not a religious person by any right. If you search flat earth vids on YouTube you will come across a shit ton of people who believe in the Bible and Jesus. Nothing wrong with that but it just turns me off. Especially because the Bible/Jesus are just assimilated or stolen stories from generations upon generations before. Honestly I have no fucking idea why anyone would want to hide it. That is my biggest hang up with the whole thing. My guess? That the reason is a lot bigger than anything I could imaging</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah but - consider the other highly likely possibility at the time:  all that mess was created in order to make Julian Assange seem less credible by making it seem like he was compromised/captured.  That was done so at a critical time when the integrity of wikileaks was hugely important.  As he puts it (and as was said at the time by other conspirators) it was a &quot;black PR campaign&quot;, and one which he had no control over (no ability to definitively give proof that couldn&#39;t be countered by black-PR trolls that didn&#39;t involve him having an active internet connection for live-streaming).  There&#39;s a strong case for a group associated with the Clintons cutting his internet and causing all that mess in order to discredit him at a critical time - for little consequence (nothing illegal or dangerous PR e.g. killing him).  It was an easy win - all the discrediting, minus the martydom.  Once he&#39;s finally back, all people can whine about is how the poor guy didn&#39;t have internet for a few months.  Big human rights complaint, there.</p>

<p>I dunno.  With the livestream, I&#39;m convinced he&#39;s alive and well.  <em>Maybe</em> compromised still, but... eh, he always could have been.  He continues to say and do important things, that&#39;s all anyone can hope for.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So if Russians came here and spouted Russian propaganda and Trump ordered them to be killed you would think that&#39;s perfectly fine? You think if Trump stayed as president for SIX terms that&#39;d be fine? </p>

<p>Anna Stepanovna Politkovskaya wrote many articles being very critical of Putin, she was assassinated in the elevator of the apartment a few days later. It doesn&#39;t help the fact that 24 other journalists who were MURDERED had extremely critical views and articles of Putin.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not talking about passenger airliners. Look at high altitude weather balloons. There are videos on YouTube where they get up to 121k feet. By simple geometry that should be enough height to see the curve. There isn&#39;t one. It&#39;s perfectly straight. Or, if you do see a curve it&#39;ll flex. Going from concave, to straight, to convex and back and forth. The only way that is possible is with a straight line. In fact, if you take the high altitude Red Bull jump video and compare it side by side with a weather balloon video at the same altitude you can clearly see manipulation. Fish eye lenses work wonders for creating curves</p>

    <div class="md"><p>First of all, I know what a theory is. Calm your tits.</p>

<p>Secondly what I was actually referring to was the general theory of relativity, which is how we <em>describe</em> gravity. </p>

<p>Finally, you&#39;re missing the point entirely because you&#39;re stuck up your own ass.</p>

<p>In closing, grow up.</p>
