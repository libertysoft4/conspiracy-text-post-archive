        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>While the title essentially speaks for itself, I think it&#39;s important to note that this is clearly part of their strategy on this discussion forum. </p>

<p>Pizzagate has been branded as an &quot;alt right&quot; radical movement since its inception, and the CTR are attempting to brand this place as some kind of Donald Trump fuck fest republican hee-haw...We want to be able to reach people from ALL parts of the spectrum, and by them brigading and painting us as this conservative based echo chamber, we will not be able to be taken seriously by the left/liberals. </p>

<p>They will be just as pissed and disgusted as you and I are regarding this stuff once they learn about it, but we need to expose the CTR strategy to try and nip it in the bud. Try to spread this along, just keep in mind, I&#39;m extremely confident that this is their agenda. There is no doubt that they are convening and plotting to carry this out on any discussion platform talking about Pizzagate. They wanna make this look like some ficking Salem Withc Trials hunt type of shit against democrats. Don&#39;t let them do it. </p>

<p><strong>SPEZ: This Russia shit is being shoved down our throats here by the shills as well. They are trying to make it seem like this Flynn Russian connection is a &quot;legit conspiracy&quot; worth looking into and that Pizzagate is nonsense and that we are wasting our time and ruining the sub by discussing it. They want us To divert our attention into Flynn/Russia. Don&#39;t buy the horseshit. We all know the Russia narrative is a crock of BS...</strong></p>

    <div class="md"><p>The entirety of reddit has turned into a shit show since about two months before the election.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve been here a long time, I up voted the Trump&#39;s plane on the tarmac the same as a Russian diplomat before the election. </p>

<p>However, taking a look at the sentiment outside of this sub right before the election and now, it is difficult for me to believe that their isn&#39;t an effort to push Trump supporters into doubting their vote and to make them feel embarrassed for voting for him.</p>

<p>They should investigate Russian claims, but just like with Pizzagate we shouldn&#39;t take anything as a beacon of truth.</p>

<p>Investigate everything equally.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Because there has been a clear difference in this subs substance since <a href="/r/pizzagate">/r/pizzagate</a> was banned and the election.  Dissenting opinions now result in calls of being a corporate shill rather than a real consideration of the discussion. </p>

<p>Im sure youll probably look at my history and say the same.  But that could be because there are still people in this sub who believe any conspiracy should be discussed.  Not just ones that fit a certain group&#39;s agenda. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>For years in hear dissent or disagreement has often been followed by accusations of shilling. One thing this last election cycle taught us is that there is a documented army of shills out there and we know who&#39;s message they are pushing.

    <div class="md"><p>I dont see anyone considering the real possibility though?</p>

<p>Basically false flag shilling.  After tracking the ctr and brock efforts extensively during the election i noticed a shift towards the end. </p>

<p>The initial ctr stuff was clearly clumsy but then became more advanced. Began with brand new accounts but then progressed to purchased and aged accounts that would collect karma by making highly agreeable posts in sports, sports team, music, band, etc subs. Subs that were smaller and more welcoming. </p>

<p>The first i found was one that posted in an sub which provided support for homosexual males. The first comments for the account were &quot;hi im new here&quot; and &quot;i just came out&quot; which garnered a good bit of karma.  Then the account went dormant for two months, and then bam huge amounts of pro clinton activity all over the place with phrases and comments and daily arguments straight from the super-pac mailers combined with vociferous attacks. (I know about the mailers because i signed up for them as well on a hunch). </p>

<p>Is it so unreasonable that the same group(s) havent just switched focus and now masquerade on reddit as trump supporters to sow dissension and divert discussion, all the while trying to portray trump supporters in a progressively worse light? And along the way they pick up actual supporters in their wake, because they have created accounts that display support for trump and so their concerted efforts are given more credence by actual followers. </p>

<p>Just a thought but it follows along with documented online propaganda efforts. </p>

<p>Maybe <a href="/u/Nutrition_Research">/u/Nutrition_Research</a> can link in some of the &#39;playbooks&#39; that have been discovered and discussed in <a href="/r/shills">/r/shills</a>. </p>

<p>Also, one reason there are a lot of Trump supporters here is because we have been pushed out of other forums that were either removed r/pizzagate, or co-opted by an echo chamber operated by shills (v/pizzagate and the_donald)</p>

No doubt there is a lack of evidence presented to the public but if he was innocent then why not fight it? Trump even said &quot;the leaking of info is what the real issue is&quot; on Twitter which makes it seem that the leak is true. Does it not?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Because he spoke with a diplomat before being in office. That&#39;s why he resigned/fired. I think he was called out and his resignation is justified, I&#39;m not sure if it is evidence of corruption or Flynn jumping the gun on his job.</p>

<p>I kinda lean towards the latter based on Flynn and his son, they are more outspoken and anyone months ago could have called that they were the strongest link to the Russian narrative. Trump having him resign is probably the best course of action if he was trying to keep the administration corruption free, but it also fits if they are trying to hide ties to Russia.</p>

<p>My hope is that Flynn knew his goose was cooked and he messed up and took the resignation for the betterment of the administration.</p>

<p>Of course, I&#39;m probably being hopeful.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There are many different angles involved in social media astroturfing.  These services are utilized on the right and the left in political campaigns, but they are also used in long term ideological power struggles.  There are services pushing movements that are anti-EU, anti-NATO, anti-US, anti-globalist anti-Russia, anti-China, anti-Islam, anti-ISIS.  There are also services just pushing pro-country propaganda (ex: bots posting pro-India spam).</p>

<p>These services are not all equal, in quality, funding, or success.</p>

<p>These services also do not make up a marge percentage of the social media conversation.  The most successful technique is seeding natural conversation and recruiting people close to the desired views.  Twitter bots are garbage, they have no real followers and just spam shit comments.</p>

<p>The most successful services wouldn&#39;t utilize bots too often, maybe just stat pumping.  They also don&#39;t have 500,000 paid employees typing at keyboards.  They utilize data analytics for targeting strategies, and utilize multiple platforms to influence trending for propaganda aimed at a receptive audience.  </p>

<p>Consider any honest political person who&#39;s trying to influence their local democratic party, via facebook/twitter/newspaper comments.  They are trying to get 50 people to see their view and begin pushing it alongside them.  This is the same for astroturfing operations, except the people behind it are doing it for dishonest reasons, and they have massive amounts of funding and capital.</p>

<p>In this subreddit, it seems like people think 75% of &quot;the other side&quot; are paid shills.  In reality, it&#39;s more likely that 1-5% are.  The real shilling happens before the people are arguing here, when they&#39;ve read 30-40 articles linked by people in the same group, supporting the same positions, and changing their opinions on the topic.  </p>

<hr/>

<p>Since this post is in response to astroturfing services that are not the ones used by the left in the 2016 election, I&#39;ll post some solid sourcing and articles on different examples.</p>

<p>Please take the time to read this article, it documents a very relevant trial run of this in 2015.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Dozens of journalists, media outlets and politicians, from Louisiana to New York City, found their Twitter accounts inundated with messages about the disaster. “Heather, I’m sure that the explosion at the #ColumbianChemicals is really dangerous. Louisiana is really screwed now,” a user named @EricTraPPP tweeted at the New Orleans Times-Picayune reporter Heather Nolan. Another posted a screenshot of CNN’s home page, showing that the story had already made national news. ISIS had claimed credit for the attack, according to one YouTube video; in it, a man showed his TV screen, tuned to an Arabic news channel, on which masked ISIS fighters delivered a speech next to looping footage of an explosion. A woman named Anna McClaren (@zpokodon9) tweeted at Karl Rove: “Karl, Is this really ISIS who is responsible for #ColumbianChemicals? Tell @Obama that we should bomb Iraq!” But anyone who took the trouble to check CNN.com would have found no news of a spectacular Sept. 11 attack by ISIS. It was all fake: the screenshot, the videos, the photographs.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Cambridge Analytica (CA) is a privately held company that combines data mining and data analysis with strategic communication for the electoral process. It was created in 2013 as an offshoot of its British parent company SCL Group to participate in American politics.  In 2014, CA was involved in 44 U.S. political races.  The company is heavily funded by the family of Robert Mercer, an American hedge-fund billionaire.  In 2015 it became known as the data analysis company working initially for Ted Cruz&#39;s presidential campaign.  In 2016, after Cruz&#39;s campaign had faltered, Cambridge Analytica started to work for Donald Trump&#39;s presidential campaign.</p>

<p>SCL Group calls itself a &quot;global election management agency&quot; known for involvement &quot;in military disinformation campaigns to social media branding and voter targeting&quot;. SCL’s involvement in the political world has been primarily in the developing world where it has been used by the military and politicians to study and manipulate public opinion and political will. SCL claims to have been successful to help foment coups.</p>

<p>CA&#39;s involvement in the 2016 Republican Party presidential primaries became known in July 2015.[7] As of December 2015 CA prided itself to have collected up to 5,000 data points on over 220 million Americans. At that time Robert Mercer was a major supporter of Ted Cruz. The Mercer family funded CA directly and indirectly through several super-PACs as well as through payments via Cruz&#39;s campaign.</p>

<p>In September, the Trump campaign spent $5 million with CA to target potential voters.[24] Eventually, the Trump campaign spent about $15 million.</p>

<p>After Trump&#39;s win of the presidential election on November 8, 2016, Matthew Oczkowski, Head of Product for CA, indicated that &quot;(o)ur internal data showed the race tightening in the last few weeks of the election because of previously hidden trends within voter sampling and demographic abnormalities in absentee ballots and early voting (particularly in rural areas). These trends, in part, were responsible for the boost towards the president-elect in the industrial Midwest. Our models predicted most of the late movement correctly.&quot; Alexander Nix indicated that CA&#39;s involvement took an &quot;instrumental part&quot; in the win.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Tapping a network of Trump-friendly technologists in Silicon Valley, Kushner enlisted Brad Parscale, a San Antonio marketing strategist who sports Trump ties and Zegna suits, to run the campaign’s digital task force, dubbed “Project Alamo.” Parscale’s 100-person crack team reportedly spends $70 million a month to take people who are leaning toward Trump and turn them into the candidate’s most ardent fans. At the same time, Parscale’s San Antonio-based team is engaged in a wide-ranging effort to discourage Democrats from supporting Hillary Clinton. “We have three major voter suppression operations under way,” a senior official told Businessweek. Specifically, the campaign is aiming to turn off young women, African Americans, and millennials, using targeted campaigns designed to make them too disillusioned to vote.</p>

<p>For the people who do support Trump, the team has figured out how to reach them on Facebook and keep them hooked, even after the election is over. It’s that upside that drew Stephen Bannon, the former Breitbart News executive who came up as the Trump campaign C.E.O. this summer, in. “I wouldn’t have come aboard, even for Trump, if I hadn’t known they were building this massive Facebook and data engine,” Bannon told the magazine. By November 8, Businessweek reports, the Trump campaign will have collected up to 14 million e-mail addresses and personal information—including credit cards—for some 2.5 million people.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>An automated army of pro-Donald J. Trump chatbots overwhelmed similar programs supporting Hillary Clinton five to one in the days leading up to the presidential election, according to a report published Thursday by researchers at Oxford University.</p>

<p>“They’re yelling fools,” Dr. Howard said. “And a lot of what they pass around is false news.”</p>

<p>In some cases, the bots would post embarrassing photos, make references to the Federal Bureau of Investigation inquiry into Mrs. Clinton’s private email server, or produce false statements, for instance, that Mrs. Clinton was about to go to jail or was already in jail.</p>

<p>The Oxford researchers had previously reported that political chatbots had played a role in shaping the political landscape that led to Britain’s “Brexit” vote.</p>

<p>The researchers have coined the term “computational propaganda” to describe the explosion of deceptive social media campaigns on services like Facebook and Twitter.</p>

<p>Pointing out conspiracies from the emails is NOT Hillary bashing, that is a lie the media told you. Most of the regulars here are people who didn&#39;t support Bush, Clinton, Obama and only like Trump because for the first time ever the media who we believe is controlled (emails show this) has done nothing but attempt to a) stop his presidency and now b) create scandals and destroy ties with Russia?</p>

<p>Is he controlled opposition? Maybe, and that&#39;s a valid argument, but don&#39;t let your hatred from Trump (created by the media and groupthink) stop you from thinking critically and actually analyzing the situation.</p>

<p>The Dossier, flynns connection to russia.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The Dossier is complete nonsense full of grammar and spelling mistakes along with mention of the wrong person with the same name as someone on Trump&#39;s transition team, and was &quot;leaked&quot; by someone who was paid specifically to find &quot;dirt&quot; on Trump.</p>

<p>All Flynn did was talk to the Russian ambassator (part of his job description, especially considering it was soon after &quot;sanctions&quot; were put in by Obama in regards to &quot;election hacking&#39; a.k.a. &quot;b.s.&quot;) before he took the job. He did nothing illegal, it was a trust issue that he did not enclose that to Pence. How is there some Russian connection there? I don&#39;t see it looking from my perspective.</p>

<p>Listen the media has been talking nonstop about Russia since Ukraine, there is a clear narrative being construed here with millions of people blindly following it. I mean they even went as fair as to fabricate the claim  that &quot;Russia hacked the electricity grid&quot; in Virginia. The whole thing is a collaborated effort to a) get Trump out of office and b) destabilize relations with Russia for the deep state&#39;s gain.</p>

<p>Literally if Trump we&#39;re to be called by a Russian phone number, the media would post something like, &quot;Russians attempt to call Trump to blackmail him,&quot; it&#39;s just sad that they have so much control over the narrative. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Because they do want it, they&#39;ve been anti-trump since way before the election. </p>

<p>Does no one find it strange that the Russian narrative stemmed from unnamed sources in the CIA and NSA before the election? Now it&#39;s the full truth based on the MSM?</p>

<p>Now there is apparently a Russian spy vessel 15 miles out from the north eastern coast of America. That&#39;s weird right? That&#39;s almost convenient after Flynn&#39;s resignation.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not saying it isn&#39;t true, I haven&#39;t been presented with evidence that makes me confident in kickstarting the second half of the cold war.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Nice over-exaggeration.</p>

<p>I believe that when the news starts creating phrases that don&#39;t represent the reality of the situation and resort to emotional based fear-mongering articles to get their point across they are intentionally manipulating people to herd to a certain though. </p>

<p>Mainstream news isn&#39;t inherently false, actually the majority of it is true, but they do spin the &quot;truth&quot; to achieve certain political/business goals. It&#39;s the difference between saying something like &quot;The Russian government hacked the election,&quot; vs &quot;John Podesta&#39;s email server was allegedly hacked by Russian based hackers according to CIA.&quot; One of those is clearly further from reality than the other (though the evidence is weak that Russia was involved in the first place), but which one became the widely used phrase? It&#39;s not that it&#39;s false, but dishonest if that makes sense.</p>

<p>You&#39;re still completely ignoring the basis of conspiracy, that the media is in on it.  You&#39;re completely trusting their coordinated reports without questioning their motives, something a typical conspiracy poster would never do.</p>

<p>&#39;by working every day to spread Kremlin propaganda, the paid trolls have made it impossible for the normal Internet user to separate truth from fiction.</p>

<p>“The point is to spoil it, to create the atmosphere of hate, to make it so stinky that normal people won’t want to touch it,” Volkov said, when we met in the office of Navalny’s Anti-Corruption Foundation. “You have to remember the Internet population of Russia is just over 50 percent. The rest are yet to join, and when they join it’s very important what is their first impression.” The Internet still remains the one medium where the opposition can reliably get its message out. But their message is now surrounded by so much garbage from trolls that readers can become resistant before the message even gets to them. During the protests, a favorite tactic of the opposition was making anti-Putin hashtags trend on Twitter. Today, waves of trolls and bots regularly promote pro-Putin hashtags. What once was an exhilarating act of popular defiance now feels empty. &#39;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think you&#39;re confusing Neoliberal with Progressives (adding the word leftists seems redundant). Many establishment neoliberals have been claiming they are progressives (ahem, Clinton anyone?) simply to get votes. A good percentage of people just believe what a politician say outright, so I can see why you&#39;d assume this, but you&#39;re wrong.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, you&#39;re just trying to confuse the issue. The elite in America is &quot;progressive&quot; - there is not point in trying to sow confusion over labels. That is how they label themselves, and that is how their fellow travelers label themselves.</p>

<p>&quot;True Progressivism&quot; is exactly what the corporate elite and the globalist imperialism pushes. That <em>is</em> their agenda.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You seem to be ignoring reality and creating your own definitions - the Clintonites are progressives - self-described. They are not classical liberals, hence the term &quot;neo-liberal.&quot;</p>

<p>The term &quot;progressive&quot; was originally used to describe people like Teddy Roosevelt, then later was adopted by the softer parts of the Communist party, and when the Soviet Union fell, the former Communists virtually all rebranded themselves as &quot;progressives.&quot;</p>

<p>Hillary Clinton is a self-described &quot;progressive.&quot; Her famous line against Bernie Sanders was, &quot;would reforming Wall Street end racism? No! Would reforming the banks end sexism? No!&quot;</p>

<p>That&#39;s progressivism - cultural Marxism, promoting &quot;Social Justice&quot; instead of economic justice.</p>

<p>I&#39;m sorry you&#39;ve been a victim of propaganda for likely your entire adult life and never once looked passed the boogey-men you were being fed.</p>

<p>If there is an investigation into Trump&#39;s Russian connection then by all means post with all the evidence you have. I&#39;ll question everyone of your sources, which is common.

    <div class="md"><p>It happens to pizzagate posters too, quit acting like it&#39;s only Trump apologists. </p>

<p>Just post something political charged from each side of the issue and watch the upvotes and downvotes battle. I&#39;ve seen dramatic shifts of 30 points up or down in less than a minute.</p>

<p>The Russian narrative started from CIA insiders and James Clapper, who have been heavy criticized on this subreddit and always have because of PRISM, NSA spying, and MKULTRA. It&#39;s not like one day everyone decided that Trump is the second coming of Jesus. They believe that the deep state is trying to save their interests.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You seem to be ignoring reality and creating your own definitions - the Clintonites are progressives - self-described. They are not classical liberals, hence the term &quot;neo-liberal.&quot;</p>

<p>The term &quot;progressive&quot; was originally used to describe people like Teddy Roosevelt, then later was adopted by the softer parts of the Communist party, and when the Soviet Union fell, the former Communists virtually all rebranded themselves as &quot;progressives.&quot;</p>

<p>Hillary Clinton is a self-described &quot;progressive.&quot; Her famous line against Bernie Sanders was, &quot;would reforming Wall Street end racism? No! Would reforming the banks end sexism? No!&quot;</p>

<p>That&#39;s progressivism - cultural Marxism, promoting &quot;Social Justice&quot; instead of economic justice.</p>

<p>I&#39;m sorry you&#39;ve been a victim of propaganda for likely your entire adult life and never once looked passed the boogey-men you were being fed.</p>
