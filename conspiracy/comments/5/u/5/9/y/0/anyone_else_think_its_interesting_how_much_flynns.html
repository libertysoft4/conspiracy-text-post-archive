    <div class="md"><p>I just noticed when I woke up today(12 hours ago) this story was literally #1-6 on r/all/top(including 1 r/conspiracy post) and now on every comment thread discussing it all the top comments are basically saying how stupid everyone is who doesn&#39;t believe Donald is a Russian shilll.

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s a major news story. To me, it makes perfect sense that it would be high up in <a href="/r/all">/r/all</a> considering that it could turn into one of the biggest scandals ever.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I mean trump never denied that he knew what Flynn discussed, possibly because he can&#39;t  deny it because he ordered Flynn to contact them? White House counsel to trump was given the info about the call by attorney general Yates but they never briefed the incoming president that his national security adviser was in a position of compromise by the Russians? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>One of the biggest scandals ever? Bro, do you even deep state?</p>

<p>So what is proven is that he talked about sanctions with a Russian ambassador before inauguration but after Trump won the election.</p>

<p>That doesn&#39;t sound like the biggest scandal ever it sounds like... ...nothing. If there <em>was</em> some kind of potential pay to play (bribery) thing going on then that is a scandal and deserves attention but still not even close to the biggest scandal ever. And yet it gets spammed over and over here and no doubt in over more mainstream subs.</p>

<p>Meanwhile 3 Muslim Brotherhood connected young men were caught illegally accessing a senate intelligence committee computer system and o didn&#39;t even hear about it until 3 days later. That seems like a bigger deal. There are so many more crazy things going on right now that it&#39;s just laughable to inflate the importance of this.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, they are stating that it&#39;s because Flynn lied to Pence, and they could no longer trust him. It could be that there is more to the story of why they can no longer trust him, and that he was possibly working for the other side. It could also be a possibility that Trump is under the mentality that he can afford zero fuck ups right now in his war against the CIA/deep state. Time will tell, I guess.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not against the idea but I would think the government has more info and cannot just spill the beans completely.    I&#39;m not buying a conspiracy here, I think Trump is just that stupid and his people he put around him are that stupid .   You&#39;re dealing with mega rich people who have screwed others to get even richer.  Then they just give some money as donations and get prime spots on the president Trump cabinet.     Drain the swamp hahahaha..</p>

<p>Anyone who can still sit here and justify Trump is just refusing to admit it now.  He&#39;s a joke, he can&#39;t even give proper handshakes to other foreign leaders!  And yes I know it&#39;s nuts that it&#39;s even a topic but that&#39;s just how bad it&#39;s become with Trump.</p>

<p>He impulsively pulls this travel ban shit with no evidence to make it look like he needed to do it.  Whomever he has hired has severely let him down because that was such a huge fucking botch by him and furthermore he does all this shit in a few days after coming into office!  There&#39;s no plan thought out for anything he does, look at the wall he wants!  He can&#39;t even negotiate with Mexico to help build it and help pay, master negotiator my ass man.</p>

<p>I wanted to have hope he would do the right thing but that&#39;s not who he is.  He&#39;s just a power hungry, money loving , narcissist who bullshitted his way into the white house because he had a horrible opponent who is just as bad as him.   I voted Johnson and everyday lately I feel good I did.    </p>

<p>I honestly think Russia is blackmailing him, I really do.    I think what they have on him could be so bad for him that he&#39;s so deep in this he can&#39;t get out unscathed....   the conspiracy is there, wtf did Trump do or what deal did he make that has him labeled Puttin&#39;s bitch ?!      If the dossier is true, he made that oil deal and the pee pee is gonna flow all over him unfortunately this time it won&#39;t be for pleasure.</p>
