    <div class="md"><p>Someone else on reddit explained this decriminalization;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Keep in mind that decriminalize means that offence was moved out of the criminal law and into administrative one. It&#39;s still illegal. But instead of long jail times, administrative offences are limited by 15 days of jail and no criminal record, they also don&#39;t go through the court (unless the accused wants to challenge the accusation). So a person will sit their 2 weeks in jail or pay a fine and can live normally afterwards. If you get a criminal record in Russia, you&#39;re pretty much janitor for life - you won&#39;t get any skilled labor job.
Even the first offence (and with no serious harm) will still get an offender an administrative punishment and is still considered an illegal act.
If it is serious abuse then it is treated like a criminal act and up to 15 years of jail time can be given for that.
Russia is basically changing the basic law applicable to minor domestic violence (and only minor and only if no more than 1x a year) to be the same as for minor violence outside a domestic relationship (which changed a few years ago, but excluded &quot;domestic&quot; violence) - i.e. the &quot;regular&quot; Russian standard is if you get drunk and get in a fight with your cousin. Up to 15 days in jail + a fine + potential community service. Now, do major domestic violence OR minor violence 2x in any year - you are back to full penalties. Sort of makes sense - and goes both ways.
For example, some Russian woman throws a plate at her cheating husband and the cops are called to break it up and decide for some reason to make an arrest, it would result in a lower penalty and technically an &quot;Administrative&quot; one without the full standard legal process and also not necessarily result in a full-blown criminal record.
This law was pushed forward initially by 23 women of the Russian state Duma</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It&#39;s not really a bad thing. Removing this from criminal law isn&#39;t bad persay. Makes it way easier to actually report domestic abuse as it doesn&#39;t have to go through criminal court. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not every culture is the same as yours. This only affects minor domestic abuse. Previously lets say you grabbed your spouses arm, and left a bruise, your life would have been ruined under the current laws. This stopped married women from reporting these types of scenarios because it doesn&#39;t deserve the harsh punishments. </p>

<p>It&#39;s not a perfect solution to the problem, but the statistics of double domestic abuse being reported could either be more people are being abused, or more people are coming out about abuse. I don&#39;t have the answers but under the majority of circumstances, this change of law helps. </p>

<p>Minor abuse is bad, but open handed slapping your wife one time doesn&#39;t deserve 15 years in prison. The laws before were worse. Like i said before, women wouldn&#39;t report their husbands because they would get severe punishment. </p>

<p>I&#39;m a woman. I would much rather live in Russia than any Muslim (Sharia Law) country. So to me, Russia and Putin look good.</p>

<p>You responded to that with this.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This makes no sense at all. You are not in a position where you need to make such a choice. Nobody is.
That&#39;s like saying I&#39;d rather get beaten by Joe than raped by Jeff so getting beaten by Joe looks good to me.
Joe is awesome!
What is wrong with you people?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Reading comprehension?</p>

<p>I explained why it makes no sense to talk about Sharia. So why do you want to talk about Sharia with me? There&#39;s literally no point to talk about Sharia in this thread.</p>

<p>It is only being used as a distraction from the actual topic.</p>

<p>Why are you trying to make this about Sharia? Unless you want to distract fromt eh actual topic, it makes no sense at all.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Allow me to post a comment I just made in a previous post, Edits and all:</p>

<p>Russia and America need each other if they are to deal with the terrorism threats flooding into Europe from Syria and Libya and the like, its not some big conspiracy like everyone would have you believe, the destabilization of Europe will effect both Russia AND the United States.</p>

<p>Russia and America need to work together, not against each other, this is for the benefit of the entire planet, even better if we can get China on board as well.</p>

<p>I am sick of everyone demanding we all be enemies, maybe we don&#39;t want to be enemies, maybe, just fucking maybe, some of us just want everyone to be friends, The planet would be a whole lot nicer place if we could.</p>

<p>It&#39;s time to stop spreading fear and hate, it&#39;s time to learn to work together, because if we cannot do that, then the Human race is doomed.</p>

<p>Edit: tell me why you downvote me? I want to know what the issue with 3 major superpowers working together is? at this rate my great grand kids wont get to be the space explorers I hope for them to be, at this rate, we are all fucked. Be better then that, you can help make this change, we the people can do this, it is not impossible.</p>

<p>Edit2: [Listen to this] 9<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAQbD3bxPrM">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAQbD3bxPrM</a>) and think about everything I said, I don&#39;t waste my time commenting to spout bullshit, I am trying to help you understand, this is bigger then one nation, this is bigger then one conspiracy, this is our planet at stake, please help me out here, I cannot do this by myself.... I cannot be alone here....</p>

<p>If you want the short version, your pipedream is only possible in a world under a central authority (as that is the reigning champion currently). They&#39;ve plotted it all awhile. The final threat to their power is geurrila warfare, which means the war on terrorism, which is an eternal war, of such importance to TPTB, that they are willing to play the Op4 (Opposing Force), in order to garner an advantage over the enemy (the people). </p>

<p>Like the east and west walls of the early Roman Empire (which was divided but never fell, but merely continued under the construct of a social mechanism, the Pontiffs ;), the east and western hemispheres will align, to promote a new form of order, that we practiced in the middle east, and have now brought home to all the rest.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I worded that poorly and was thinking to fast, also I am getting a lot of comments its hard to keep track of all this, getting a little overwhelmed here, sorry.</p>

<p>I am just speaking my mind, I am trying to keep it all as a whole, but I am not very good at writing like this, so I may contradict myself sometimes, I just hope the heart of my message is getting through, I don&#39;t usually comment on things in this manner, but I have to step up and say something, none of this is right and its only seems to be getting worse, I fear for our future, and am speaking out of worry, rather then logic, something needs to change, someone needs to step up to lead the charge, and I have no idea if that&#39;s going to happen, or if we are just going to watch as the world burns.</p>

<p>I am not trying to contradict myself or start an argument, I just don&#39;t know what to say anymore, we are running out of options here, fast.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m with you only all your points, but you forgot to mention the problem of the ongoing economical sanctions on Russia over the invasion of Crimea and East-Ukraine. </p>

<p>International sanction do work, and are mostly the only method against rogue state actors, but only if all parties do work together on this goal. If one threatens to leave the community on this we do have a problem.</p>

<p>Trump is signaling to weaken the US sanctions. This destroys the international pacts on rogue states, and we don&#39;t know what will happen then. But we can assume that Russia will just take Georgia or more as it pleases. Russia needs to get its gas to Europe.
Russia already split Turkey from the US. 
Turkey is the next rogue state. The next will be the kurd territory, as this has the biggest gas reserves. Turkey only listened to the US/western community so far (the current Mosul liberation).</p>

<p>As a deal Trump will probably get Snowden.
Are you happy with this?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, Russia invading other nations is not ok, there could be more too it then that which we do not know, but from what we do know, they are being particularly aggressive in that regard.</p>

<p>BUT...</p>

<p>Crimea has massive oil and natural resource reserves, trillions of dollars worth, if the US had not imposed so many sanctions, Russia may not have felt the need to invade another nation to keep itself afloat.</p>

<p>I am not saying what they did what right, but they may have done what they needed to survive. Again not saying it is right by any means, but Russia is not the soviet union anymore, the more sanctions that get imposed on them, the more they will be forced to revert back to their old ways to keep themselves and their people alive and living semi comfortably, the US would do and has done the same for decades, Russia just does not hide it. </p>

<p>That&#39;s why you WANT another one? No, you dont? Then why is hating russia and provoking them for decades with nato and trying to fight a proxy war against their troops with isis, why is this the answer?</p>

<p>Russia has been invaded with major major losses 3 times in the last fucking century, then collapsing and getting raped for parts on its rise back up. In 16 years putin brought to relevancy and some strength. So...hate them and start a cold war with much more technology in nuclear delivery...okay. </p>

<p>God forbid we say &quot;okay, let&#39;s see how we can coexist and benefit from this&quot;. Must hate, must kill. </p>

<p>Shouldnt we hate people that hate us? How bout islamic terrorism that uses our own money to kill our people and europeans? And they dont even belong to a nation, and they commit inhumane crimes, they are the new nazi&#39;s, we can kill em in any movie with no blowback. </p>

<p>How bout it? No nuclear death and Yes killing Jihadists?</p>

<p>Now given this particular situation, I would definitely expect Russia to try to get the candidate who didn&#39;t want to impose a no fly zone over where they&#39;re trying to help Syria stop isis to get elected. If Donald trump repeatedly said that he wants to be allies with them,  I don&#39;t doubt that he would try to gather some people to try to make that happen. </p>

<p>Yes, Hillary proposed a no-fly zone in Syria, I still don&#39;t know why you guys interpret that as an act of war against Russia. You do know USA fights ISIS also? Why exactly is Russia a country we want to be buddies with? Putin is an elected dictator, they murder journalists and ban protests, invade neighboring countries and claim their land. </p>

Even if the worst was true, how is it much different from the Clinton foundation taking loads of checks from Saudi Arabia, Qatar and other states?

<p>Russia is a country proven to want to actively divide us, they would bomb the fuck out of us if they knew they could get away with it with absolutely no repricusions.</p>

<p>I wouldn&#39;t be so sketched out if it wasn&#39;t for the fact that three people in Trumps administration were exposed for having heavy Russian ties and all three of them stepped down. Also the fact that Trump has continued to lie about his involvement in Russia.</p>

<p>If you want the short version, your pipedream is only possible in a world under a central authority (as that is the reigning champion currently). They&#39;ve plotted it all awhile. The final threat to their power is geurrila warfare, which means the war on terrorism, which is an eternal war, of such importance to TPTB, that they are willing to play the Op4 (Opposing Force), in order to garner an advantage over the enemy (the people). </p>

<p>Like the east and west walls of the early Roman Empire (which was divided but never fell, but merely continued under the construct of a social mechanism, the Pontiffs ;), the east and western hemispheres will align, to promote a new form of order, that we practiced in the middle east, and have now brought home to all the rest.</p>

<p>International sanction do work, and are mostly the only method against rogue state actors, but only if all parties do work together on this goal. If one threatens to leave the community on this we do have a problem.</p>

<p>Trump is signaling to weaken the US sanctions. This destroys the international pacts on rogue states, and we don&#39;t know what will happen then. But we can assume that Russia will just take Georgia or more as it pleases. Russia needs to get its gas to Europe.
Russia already split Turkey from the US. 
Turkey is the next rogue state. The next will be the kurd territory, as this has the biggest gas reserves. Turkey only listened to the US/western community so far (the current Mosul liberation).</p>

<p>As a deal Trump will probably get Snowden.
Are you happy with this?</p>
