        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Ok, so we&#39;ve all seen this link, right? </p>

<p><a href="https://youtu.be/HsgAq72bAoU">https://youtu.be/HsgAq72bAoU</a></p>

<p>I believe this was spread on social media intentionally to acclimate us to this new &quot;war on human trafficking&quot; we are going to see. Also, remember the DHS public service announcement regarding trafficking? </p>

<p><a href="https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=PNkl4B7rvHY">https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=PNkl4B7rvHY</a></p>

<p>I think we are being primed for something, it seems like they are acclimating us to human trafficking and putting the spotlight on it for a reason. The establishment, in a desperate fit, needs to somehow shift the attention from them and their involvement in child abuse, and instead, find a way to brand them as part of the solution to this problem.</p>

<p>We&#39;ve been seeing arrests all week for low level scumbags, and this Kutcher video will only add more publicity and attention to the topic. So, as we see more and more arrests regarding human trafficking happen, the media will report them. They want the masses to <strong>trust</strong> and <strong>believe</strong> that the system largely works in busting these people, and that they are on our side. The higher ups could NEVER be implicated in this, right? They want the people to see examples of traffickers being busted, so they can say, </p>

<p>&quot;Whew, ok, I&#39;m glad the problem is being taken care of, the system DOES care about me and the children&quot;.</p>

<p>They are trying to get that reaction out of people ^</p>

<p>It will divert our attention from exposing the pedophilia that is rampant within DC right under our noses. If they give the impression that they are on the offensive to stop pedophilia/trafficking, and sincerely are trying to raise awareness, then nobody will suspect THEM of it. </p>

<p>So as you see people on social media sharing that video, copy the Pizzagate hashtag in there or share the Ben Swann video. Red pill as many people as you can. We need to associate this viral video, with our findings regarding Pizzagate and our investigation. </p>

<p>I agree with you, as there are people zealously posting this past week stories about people arrested for &#39;Sexual trafficking&#39; when they were simple one offs, one was a statutory rape of a 15 year old by a 24 year old guy.  Seems a lot of over-reaction with the term.  it is unclear to my why.</p>

<p>When describing the posts about busts made in here the past week, did you include the posts where dozens and hundreds were busted in yes, sexual trafficking (why did you put that in quotes?), or did you just mention two small individual incidents? Why did you only talk about those two small non stories when there have been huge busts happening in this past week? </p>

<p>I personally do not consider small cases like that, especially when it&#39;s a guy and his girlfriend &#39;sexual trafficking&#39;.  </p>

<p>There were a lot of posts about the large busts too!  I do not want anyone to think I am saying there were not.</p>

<p>But my point that you missed ages ago was that I was saying there are people here that are trying to dilute the use of the term &#39;sexual trafficking&#39; by using it for small busts.  You should be dogging them and not me.  I am the guy really trying to work with you.</p>

<p>Nah, there&#39;s more than a few blind Trump supporters here. Still others who don&#39;t like him but believe he&#39;s not involved in that stuff too. I think people like you and me are a minority even here. There was a woman who accused Trump of raping her when she was 13 years old and I&#39;m willing to believe it. Not sure if he&#39;s directly in the same circles as the pizza lovers we&#39;ve been looking at, but I think he&#39;s probably done horrible things of a similar nature. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Trump supporters will tell you that Trump hates Epstein. They love telling an anecdote about Trump catching Epstein creeping on a young girl and they say Trump kicked the guy out of his establishment. I&#39;m not so sure about all that. That said, it is worth noticing that although Bill Clinton shows up literally dozens of times on the flight logs for Epstein&#39;s &quot;Lolita Express&quot;, Trump isn&#39;t on any such list. At the very least, I think it&#39;s safe to say that Trump isn&#39;t deep into the same exact social circles even the guy likes pizza just as much the rest of those sick freaks. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Right that&#39;s what I&#39;m saying. He may not be part of the DC ring, but I&#39;m always thinking big picture, I wish the shills would understand that sometimes (not that it really matters, they&#39;re going to attack me regardless).  But, he is a wealthy and powerful guy, who clearly has a sexual appetite, and there is no doubt in my mind that he is not only aware of child abuse, trafficking, and sex with underage girls, but I&#39;d be willing to bet Trump has definitely at LEAST had sex with underage girls 12-15 on Epsteins Jet. Remember, he&#39;s in the black book. This needs to be talked about more. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>(Just sharing a comment from a post on TIL that got locked)</p>

<p>Ashton Kutcher once hosted a 3 day hackathon in San Francisco to develop software to aid the fight against human trafficking a couple years ago, which I went to.</p>

<p>I thought people would be star struck, asking for autographs, and Ashton would leave after delivering some opening remarks and posing for photos. Since it was a Friday evening, maybe he&#39;d have some fun in the city before flying back to Hollywood and Mila I thought. To be honest, I went partially because I&#39;ve never seen a celebrity before.</p>

<p>But no. His opening speech was full of emotion and passion, and everyone listened intently. He stayed the ENTIRE fucking weekend, sitting all day(s) long right in the middle of the devs, ate with them, talking with them and basically being a bro. And we&#39;re talking about a diverse crowd filled with people with backgrounds from all over the world. I kid you not he almost didn&#39;t seem to leave the building except to sleep for those 3 days.</p>

<p>Not a single person asked for an autograph to the best of my knowledge. I didn&#39;t see him pose for any photos. Not a single off topic question was asked. Ashton effing Kutcher set the tone that he was here to get down to business, to help the victims of the sex trade, and everyone followed his lead.</p>

<p>Then when time came to judge the projects, he didn&#39;t pay attention to the abstract, flashy ones, but awarded prizes to &#39;boring&#39; yet really helpful software that would actually help police. First prize was software that could track bitcoin payments made by sex traffickers. Second prize was a simple service that aggregated terminology and slangs sex traffickers and pedos would use.</p>

<p>And at the end, he was so amazed by how quickly people made progress, that he announced on the spot, 3 grants worth a 100K each for a year, for 3 people to come work with him on this project, funded by him. A line of people signed up.</p>

<p>To this day I still remember the emotion in his opening talk, and his heartfelt gratitude in his closing one. Pretty sure there were some tears. No matter what anyone says, Ashton Kutcher completely changed my perception of him that weekend.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, we were all surprised at how little tools there were for law enforcement. Ashton said we&#39;d made more useful tools the past 3 days than his organization had done the past 2 years. Mainly because they didn&#39;t have dedicated software engineers.

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, but this was 2~3 years ago, and the first prize team was simply reading the open bitcoin transaction records that everyone else could see. I&#39;m sure theres better tools now?</p>

<p>As for the second one, the slang/term aggregator was useful cause criminals change their terminology all the time. With the tool, law enforcement could easily add new terms that popped up. Honestly I&#39;m not sure how exactly it helped. It seemed like the tool was just complex enough that you needed a software engineer to develop, but not ground breakingly useful to get the government to spend budget and build it themselves.</p>

<p>And I&#39;m not even sure if the winners created companies. Was wondering how do you monetize those projects. Only thing I remember is that first prize were some young asian american students or engineers. Second prize was a guy from India, and a two Americans.</p>

<p>The people--mostly non-entities--who do the trafficking (ie. the procurers of children) are one component, the customers who pony up the big bucks to use the children are another.  Celebs with all their money and &quot;illuminati tastes&quot; are members of this second club.  Don&#39;t be naive.  Don&#39;t let them reframe the issue of the existence of powerful paedophile networks as being only about muh &quot;people trafficking&quot;.

    <div class="md"><p>I want everyone to carefully consider the public mood that got Trump elected against any and all odds and how it was that every conceivable effort that was made to prevent that from ever happening had just the very opposite effect in the end.</p>

<p>So how long does anyone here suppose it will be before those at the very top of this human trafficking and pedophile network that exists within the government, mass media, and among the corporate and old money elites who all play their part in this multi-billion dollar criminal activity can last by trying to throw their minions and street level customers to the lions in order to deflect attention away from themselves? </p>

<p>Or perhaps I should ask how long it will be before some of their minions and customers who actually have some solid evidence against them get desperate enough to trade that information to escape having them do the same thing to them or else get caught in the ever expanding network of people that are all now hunting high and low for them and leaving no stone unturned as they go about it? </p>

<p>Isn&#39;t it apparent that the more that are arrested the larger and more prevalent both the problem and the public outrage and determination to see all these creatures hunted down and brought to justice wherever they may be is simply going to grow rather than be comforted or placated in any way by any of it? What are a few hundred arrests when we not only know there are thousands involved but at every conceivable level right up to the very top of this gigantic globalist pyramid scheme? Is it really separate and distinct from any of their others, or is it the true evil that all the others rest on and holds them together? </p>

<p>Isn&#39;t it obvious that P-gate has hit a nerve that these arrogant and nervy bastards never expected after having gotten away with so much of this for so long and profited so handsomely off of it in countless ways that they thought they were invincible and could continue to do it with absolute impunity? </p>

<p>And what are we to make of the divine irony of the man whose middle name is &quot;Achilles&quot; of all things being in the very eye of this out of control firestorm that can consume them all if they can&#39;t manage to stop it? And they can&#39;t, you know. The hit on Achilles is a mortal wound. A stray arrow or perhaps something more that they and their whole criminal enterprise have been struck by and are already falling off the chariot that is going to flatten and finish them as they just as unexpectedly hit the ground... and at the very moment they were in the midst of celebrating their victory lap around all those they thought could never possibly touch them.</p>

<p>Although it is always in round-about ways or held out at arms length so we can see it and ourselves more objectively, art always imitates life. Within the vast complexity of human nature with all of it&#39;s competing and conflicting motives there are only seven actual narratives at play and it&#39;s worthwhile to both know as well as see them at play in our own everyday life as well as in the world around you. If that possibility interests you enough a good place to get started is here...

    <div class="md"><p>There is no way Ashton has become as successful, popular and wealthy as he has in Hollywood (how many Teen Choice Awards/MTV Awards has he gotten even into his 30s?) AND ALSO been a genuine, vocal advocate for anti-child trafficking. If he was sincere about his desire to help police track and arrest pedophiles his career would be DONE.</p>

<p>I think he is illuminati all the way and this cause of his is just controlled distraction. </p>

<p>He started his career in male modeling for Calvin Klein (which has long used its advertising to normalize child pornography)</p>

<p>He then started his acting career on That 70s Show. He is currently married to Mila Kunis who was his costar and love interest. She &quot;lied about her age&quot; in order to get the job and was only 14 and playing Ashton&#39;s love interest (who was 20 at the time). </p>

<p>Mila Kunis got into the industry very young and she dated Macaulay Culkin for 8 years. Macaulay Culkin has long been rumored to have been abused as a child actor and he currently has a band called Pizza Underground.</p>

<p>Ashton&#39;s co-star Wilmer Vladerrama and his co-investor in Dolce restaurant has always dated young celebs, including demi levato when she was 17 and he was 30. He also dated Mila Kunis while they were costars on That 70s Show. Oh, and he also dated Mandy Moore when she was 17 and he bragged about taking her virginity on Howard Stern.He also dated Lindsay Lohan before her 18th birthday. It&#39;s pretty clear that Ashton&#39;s close friend and business partner likes to sleep with underage girls and isn&#39;t shy about it.</p>

<p>Then, add the fact that Ashton took over for Charlie Sheen on Two And A Half Men (Sheen is a psychotic degenerate and has long been accused of raping Cory Haim). The fact that Ashton took over the role doesn&#39;t mean anything really. But since the show focused on two men and a kid living together, and Charlie is a murderous, raping pedo, I am highly suspect of anyone involved in that show.</p>

<p>Then there is the fact that he was into Kabbalah, the weird stuff between him and Demi Moore&#39;s daughters and the fact that he is also connected to Silicon Valley pedos - it all starts to seem a little fishy to me.</p>

<p>Plus, there is also this from his Wiki:
On April 16, 2009, Kutcher became the first Twitter user to reach more than 1 million followers, beating CNN in the site&#39;s &quot;Million followers contest&quot;. However, there have been several reports that Twitter manipulated the contest&#39;s results by preventing users from &quot;unfollowing&quot; Kutcher or CNN.</p>

<p>In November 2011, Kutcher received much criticism for his tweet in response to the Jerry Sandusky child sexual abuse scandal, calling the firing of Penn State football coach Joe Paterno &quot;in poor taste&quot;.[70] </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ah I meant the actual words being aggregated. I think there were words that pedos used for sex or child and some other really nasty stuff that they didn&#39;t feel comfortable putting it up on the screen.</p>

<p>But yeah come to think of it we were all adults, should have shown.</p>

<p>And I&#39;m not even sure if the winners created companies. Was wondering how do you monetize those projects. Only thing I remember is that first prize were some young asian american students or engineers. Second prize was a guy from India, and a two Americans.</p>
