<p>Antonin Gregory Scalia was an Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States from 1986 until his death in 2016. Scalia died in his sleep at age 79 on the night of February 12 or the morning of February 13, 2016 in Shafter, Texas. He was pronounced dead of apparent natural causes. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antonin_Scalia">(source)</a></p>

<h1>Possible assassination and involvement of John Podesta</h1>

<p><a href="http://pizzagate.wiki/images/d/d0/Scalia-wetworks.png">John Podesta referencing wet works days before Scalia dies</a></p>

<p>The above image is of an email, discovered in the Podesta emails provided by Wikileaks, which shows John Podesta talking to a Steve Elmendorf about &quot;wet works&quot; at &quot;the Vineyard&quot; just 3 days before Scalia&#39;s death: <a href="https://www.wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/6008">https://www.wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/6008</a></p>

<p>Famous Reddit informant <a href="http://pizzagate.wiki/FBIanon">FBIanon</a> has suggested that Justice Scalia was looking into something the Clinton Foundation did not want seen.</p>

<p>A few hours after Scalia&#39;s body was found, John Podesta received an email from Chris Stone of George Soros&#39; Open Society Foundation discussing a possible replacement for Scalia: <a href="https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/48389">https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/48389</a></p>

<p>Podesta receives another suggestion for a replacement Justice at this time from a Brent Budowsky: <a href="https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/3789">https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/3789</a></p>

<h1>Potentially coded email describing the plot</h1>

<p>There is another email sent to John Podesta from a &quot;viejojoe&quot; in which a &quot;2016 political, game changing film project&quot; is discussed almost exactly a year before Scalia&#39;s death: <a href="https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/1459">https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/1459</a></p>

<p>This lengthy email includes a single link to the Smithsonian&#39;s website which is a map of Texas can be seen: <a href="http://www.smithsonianeducation.org/educators/lesson_plans/borders/map1a.html">http://www.smithsonianeducation.org/educators/lesson_plans/borders/map1a.html</a></p>

<p>There is a single area which specifically has a line drawn to it, titled &quot;Claimed by Mexico and the Texas&quot;. This location, as can be seen by our image comparison seen below, is almost identical to the location of Scalia&#39;s vineyard. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>I have the script, the budget and a producer for this 2016 political, game changing film project - funding is needed. You would be in charge of the content and selecting the producer.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There is speculation that this email is a lengthy coded message, which seems to be supported by the mysterious nature of the sender, the sender&#39;s use of false personal information like being &quot;Joe Patterson&quot;, and the &quot;plot&quot; of the movie discussed. Who would need to ask John Podesta to read a movie script anyway?</p>

<h1>Events after death which hint at a cover-up</h1>

<p>In addition there were many unusual events following Scalia&#39;s death which hindered any further investigation:</p>

<ul>
<li>No autopsy</li>
<li>No medical examiner on site to decipher cause of death</li>
<li>No U.S. Marshal protection detail accompanying Scalia</li>
<li>No functioning CCTV cameras on day of death</li>
<li>Scalia was found clothed on bed with pillow over face</li>
<li>Scalia’s body was mysteriously cremated before it could be examined

<p>That&#39;s a reference to Clinton losing the NH primary.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;didn&#39;t think wet works meant pool parties at the Vineyard.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That&#39;s a reference to <a href="http://i.imgur.com/BkspUIS.png">this picture</a> of Bernie Sanders by the pool at a party on Martha&#39;s Vineyard.</p>

<p>Back in February of 2016, Bernie Sanders was attacking Hillary Clinton on all the big money donations she had accepted. The Clinton campaign tried to paint Sanders as hypocritical, pointing out that he had participated in big money Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee fundraising events.</p>

<p>This is how the story was playing in the media that week:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.cnn.com/2016/02/05/politics/sanders-democratic-fundraisers/">2016-02-05 CNN: Bernie Sanders: Prolific Democratic Party fundraiser</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/sanders-campaign-finance-purity-not-always-possible">2016-02-07 MSNBC For Sanders, campaign finance purity not always possible</a></li>
</ul>

<p>So, on the night of Saturday, February 6, Tina Fournoy, Bill Clinton&#39;s chief of staff, <a href="https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/32693">sends an email</a> to the Hillary Clinton campaign with an attachment, <a href="http://i.imgur.com/BkspUIS.png">IMG_0692.JPG</a>, and the description &quot;Bernie at the DSCC retreat&quot;. The campaign staff <a href="https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/?q=DSCC&amp;amp;mfrom=&amp;amp;mto=&amp;amp;title=&amp;amp;notitle=&amp;amp;date_from=2016-01-01&amp;amp;date_to=2016-12-31&amp;amp;nofrom=&amp;amp;noto=&amp;amp;count=50&amp;amp;sort=1#searchresult">discuss what to do with it</a>: &quot;Omg&quot; &quot;Can we tweet it?&quot; &quot;I think we shd give to NY post&quot;. <a href="https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/34299">&quot;I got it from a friend who took it. Do what you will with it - probably better if we got someone else to do it&quot;</a>. &quot;DSCC event in edgartown [Martha&#39;s Vineyard] last July.&quot; &quot;Will send briefing for the event with attendees.&quot;</p>

<p>So this leads to the email <a href="https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/14833">&quot;MV DSCC 2015 guest list&quot;</a>: &quot;Guests at the retreat. will have briefing in the am or later tonight&quot;. Attached is a spreadsheet with a list of guests. <a href="http://i.imgur.com/AKrZylJ.png">Number 88: Steve Elmendorf</a>, a Hillary supporter, &quot;low dollar&quot; fundraiser, and a partner in a <a href="http://teamsubjectmatter.com/">public relations firm.</a>.</p>

<p>The following afternoon: <a href="https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/9394">&quot;Thank you. We are on this.&quot;</a></p>

<p>So Steve Elmendorf —who can honestly say he was at the party, even if he didn&#39;t take the picture— delivers the photo to Perez Hilton. Perez Hilton runs the photo on <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ThePerezHilton/photos/a.428041364018074.1073741828.424686427686901/555226774632865/">Facebook</a> and <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BBk-2XqoauL/">Instagram</a> with the message &#39;I wonder what @MikeBloomberg would think about this??? &quot;@BernieSanders lounges at elite Martha&#39;s Vineyard pool, summer 2015, after helping raise money from Wall Street lobbyists.&quot;&#39;</p>

<p>There&#39;s not that much reaction to the photo, but it may have helped keep the fundraising story alive one more day:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/bernie-sanders-regular-luxurious-dscc-fundraising-retreats">2016-02-09 MSNBC: Bernie Sanders a regular at high-dollar donor retreats</a></li>
</ul>

<p>John Podesta <a href="https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/56753">emails Steve Elmendorf</a>: &quot;Thanks. Didn&#39;t think wet works meant pool parties at the Vineyard.&quot;</p>

<p>Do you think it&#39;s a coincidence that Podesta thanks Elmendorf the same day that Perez Hilton runs the photo?</p>

<p>So it doesn&#39;t matter what the pool party is. Because they&#39;re not referring to it.</p>

<p>Yes, they <em>are</em> referring to it.</p>

<p>You&#39;re unable to entertain the idea of the Clinton camp doing anything bad</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Nonsense. Hillary Clinton illegally used a mail server in an attempt to evade the strict requirements of federal records laws. She lied about it later. Her interactions with foreign governments, businesses, and individuals via the Clinton Foundation were highly improper and may well have been illegal. People were right to criticize her accepting huge payments for speeches and for keeping the contents secret, even though there was nothing illegal about it. <em>Some</em> of the allegations of the DNC/Clinton campaign &quot;rigging&quot; the primaries are true. Bill Clinton is a rapist.</p>

<p>There are plenty valid criticisms of her character, her job performance, her associations.</p>

<p>And then there&#39;s tons of fucking nonsense about the Clintons, like they send assassins around to kill off their enemies.</p>

Just an old guy dying.  Fully clothed.  With a pillow over his face.  Perfectly normal.</p>

<p>Maybe he did die of a stroke or something.  My dad was in great health and had a sudden stroke because he was just old.  Same thing could have happened to Scalia.  But we will never know.</p>

<p>Ranch where Scalia died was owned by satanist/luciferian:</p>

<p>CIBOLO CREEK (‘RENT BOY’) RANCH IS A 30,000-acre VIP resort located in west Texas, 100 miles from the Mexican border, in the Chinati Mountains.  Guests arrive by private jet at the Ranch’s own private airport.  Rooms cost $500+ per night.  Guests of the ranch typically include Hollywood figures, politicians and businessmen. Previous guests include: Mick Jagger, Bruce Willis, Tommy Lee Jones, Randy Quaid, Dick Cheney, Charlie Sheen.</p>

<p>The Cibolo Creek ‘Rent Boy’ Ranch is also frequented by an international 17th-century hunting society called the ORDER OF SAINT HUBERTUS. This all-male Order was founded in 1695 by Austrian Count Anton von Spork in the Kingdom of BOHEMIA.</p>

<p>The owner of Cibolo Creek ‘Rent Boy’ Ranch is John Poindexter.  He obtained the property in 1988. A 3rd-generation Texan, Poindexter runs a Houston-based manufacturing company, J.B. Poindexter &amp; Co. Poindexter is a leader in the ORDER of SAINT HUBERTUS.</p>

<p>The Bohemian Club owns BOHEMIAN GROVE, a 2700 acre property located north of San Francisco.  Bohemian Grove is the location of elite pedophile parties attended by international male politicians and businessmen.  Both places feature images of the pagan god Molech which is depicted as an owl.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I will have a look.  I liked your post, though.  You provide a lot of good and accurate information.  I just was not sure about the world &quot;pagan&quot;.  Maybe I am being picky.  It is like some people say Satan when I think they mean Lucifer.  It is Lucifer they worship, too, the Morning Star that feel to Earth, just like the Super Bowl halftime show.  </p>

<p>I think what these people believe is in the Talmud because the Talmud provides rules for having sex with underage children, some as young as three.  Pretty fucking sick.  There is probably more than just the Talmud, but I think the Talmud is at least a part of it.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>While those unused to these Talmudic discussions might be taken aback by the use of euphemisms, the discussion here relates to the dowry for virgins and non-virgins. It has nothing to do with what acts are allowed, encouraged, forbidden, or discouraged. It is, indeed, ironic that this passage has been manipulated from its original context of a financial discussion into one of a religious discussion. While there are numerous talmudic passages of a religious nature, this one discusses dowries and not forbidden and permitted relations!</p>

<p>The Talmud relates that a virgin is entitled a higher dowry. While the tell-tale sign of virginity is the release of blood due to the breaking of the hymen on the wedding night, there are occasions when the hymen has already been broken such as when the woman suffered an injury. The Talmud here quotes Rav Yehuda in the name of Rav that a sexual act with a male minor is not considered to be a loss of virginity because one of the participants is not fully active. While the female&#39;s hymen may have been broken, she has not engaged in what can be classified as a sexual act (although it is certainly child abuse).</p>

<p>The Talmud continues and quotes Rava as saying that a sexual act between a male adult and a female under the age of three is also not considered a loss of virginity (although it is child abuse). Since the girl is too young for her hymen to be broken, she is still considered a virgin.</p>

<p>Nowhere is the Talmud permitting such behavior. Sex outside of a marriage is strictly forbidden (Maimonides, Mishneh Torah, Hilchot Ishut 1:4, Hilchot Na&#39;arah Betulah 2:17; Shulchan Aruch, Even HaEzer 26:1, 177:5) as is this obvious case of child abuse. The Talmud is only discussing ex post facto what would happen if such a case arose.</p>

<p>So in the case that a young girl has her hymen broken through something non-sexual (which can happen), the Talmud is explaining that the child is not to be considered a non-virgin. I&#39;m not sure if there are some sick Orthodox fucks who have interpreted this in their own way, but that is not the intention of the Talmud. For sure I&#39;m going to get blasted for &quot;posting a wall of text&quot;, because many people on the internet have the attention span of a young child, and couldn&#39;t be bothered to do proper research or do anything that might contradict their viewpoint. The Talmud gets into very specific situations, as some people are religious crazies and need specific answers to situations. Once again, the Talmud does not permit sex with minors. This goes against Jewish law. It&#39;s pretty fucking simple.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Man, I really don&#39;t believe so. I think I am a 1/4 Ashkenazi, and everyone from that side of my family is pretty damn normal. If the Ashkenazi were truly descendent from Edomites it would have likely been lost in the stream a long time ago, and now they are just regular people like you and I.</p>

<p>here is an article regarding the topic, though this would require much more research, which I don&#39;t have the time for right at this moment:</p>

<p>DellaPergola said that “serious research would have factored in the glaring genetic similarity between Sephardim and Ashkenazim, which mean Polish Jews are more genetically similar to Iraqi Jews than to a non-Jewish Pole.”</p>

<p>He noted the “great genetic similarity” between Ashkenazim and the Jews of Rome, who came from the Land of Israel and later from the Mediterranean. “In no way the explanation that Elhaik gives of the origins of the Jews in Europe can apply to the Jews of Rome. Therefore his explanation is wrong,” DellaPergola said.</p>

<p>Even though I&#39;d like to agree with this article, I&#39;d take this with a grain of salt though. Most of this shit is really confusing and requires time and patience. There is a whole bunch of misinformation out there, so it requires a lot of analysis to sniff out the truth. I really am curious about this, so I will need to dedicate time to this subject.

<p><strong>&quot;IMPROTANT: Jews are not the enemy. Jews are the good guys.

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;d agree with this. Though I think it is important to remember that Hitler may have very well been just a tool used by those who lurk in the shadows (I&#39;m guessing people like Rothschilds, heads of massive multinationals). They likely saw a charismatic guy, and manipulated the situation in order to create more instability in the world and more financial prowess for themselves through slave labour and other means. For instance, it is crazy to think that Ford motors were building Nazi tanks, but yeah it is true...</p>

<p>I must admit though, I am heavily influenced by that documentary from JFK to 9-11 (everything is a rich man&#39;s lie). I think that is what it is called. While not all of it may have been true, I think there are some interesting ideas in there. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This was very sketchy and definitely needs more attention called to it. The whole thing seems like a very calculated effort to make sure that when Hillary won, she had a clear path to secure democrat control of the Supreme Court, by offing the old conservative guy prematurely.</p>

<p>Except she lost and now he&#39;ll get replaced with another conservative, so now they just murdered a man for no good reason. Kinda like they did to Seth Rich and others. These people need to burn.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Or scalia was an obese elderly man whose time had come. I am all for conspiracies but lets be a bit more creative. Scalia was in the pocket of big business and crony capitalism why the fuck would the clintons or any of the elite want to take him out. They were on the same team... I understand fox/right wing news ran with propaganda about much of a strict orginialist he was but look into some of his decisions for yourself, he only cared for the constitution when if fit with the interests of his special interests. This country is in a better place with this man no longer on the court; whether assassinated by podesta and clinton or cheeseburgers and time, its merely a question of who to thank. So long as men die, liberty will never perish. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks for this post. It succinctly cover the evidence of Scalia&#39;s murder.</p>

<p>The pillow over the face says it all. It&#39;s a clear reminder to people, who know what&#39;s going on, not to fuck with them.</p>

<p>He died of natural causes, laying like at a funeral, but with a pillow over his head.</p>

<p>Okay 👌  Clintons.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not reading all the comments, so not sure if anyone brought this up or not. But I looked into that guy who sent that movie script when that shit first came out and it looks to me like it&#39;s just a guy who has ideas for really shitty movies and sent an unsolicited email to John Podesta. Dude probably know Podesta is a connected dude with similar political ideology so thought he could get it funded.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This connection has been noted in the past, but there are also some subtle differences between the script in Podesta&#39;s email and the script seen in Viejo Joe&#39;s facebook scripts. Definitely a few aspects of that guy are suspect.</p>

<p><strong>&quot;IMPROTANT: Jews are not the enemy. Jews are the good guys. It&#39;s a group of devil worshiping people who are not Jews but claim to be Jews that are the problem.&quot;</strong>  Yes, I agree with you.  If only Hitler saw who the real enemy is, his place in history would be much different.  I think that the group you mention is very skilled at misdirecting people&#39;s anger at other groups, such as the Jews.  </p>
