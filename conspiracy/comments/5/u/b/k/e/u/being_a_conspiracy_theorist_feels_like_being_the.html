    <div class="md"><p>There is truth in this. So many good people want to think others are just as good as they choose to be. Yet, it seems to me, that people are averse to looking at the demons within, or rather the seemingly unwanted or unpleasant aspects of our thoughts, feelings and actions, because they don&#39;t want to have unpleasant feelings. Yet, tolook at these shadow aspects of ourselves is to demystify them, to understand them, to then perceive them on a regular basis, not just within, but outside of oneself. In coming to <em>know thyself</em>, we come to know how others work too.</p>

<p>This knowledge of self, of its darkness, allows us to navigate around much of the darkness created by others around us. It&#39;s a study of self-interest. Self-interests that conflict with others are what tempt beings toward evil. Evil is simply self-serving behavior at the expense of others. Self-serving beings chase gain, avoid loss and calculate risk. They are very predictable. Those know know more about themselves can predict and utilize such beings. This is how evil beings form into hierarchies. They often avoid the selfless ones, because their behavior deviates from that script, so it is less predictable, and it could easily throw a spanner into the works of their organization. </p>

<p>The other path you can go with this knowledge of self is to help others and even yourself, provided it is not at the expense of others. Things like avoiding drama and entangling situations are easier and often harmless to so in relation to others. Indeed, avoiding their drama can even help them sometimes. They may just be seeking a cheap emotional high instead of fixing their own issues. You can sometimes see exactly what&#39;s wrong in another person&#39;s situation and if you are able to adequately articulate it to them, in a tactful enough way, you can help them help themselves to do very real good for them. This is significantly harder, but far more fulfilling, than choosing to manipulate others to serve yourself.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sorry, I guess I have to be more literal here. It&#39;s astounding that someone on a conspiracy forum can&#39;t connect the dots as to why I posted that. I linked to a subreddit about people who think they&#39;re smarter than they actually are and act pretentious about it. The post above me makes it sound like anybody who doesn&#39;t believe in conspiracies is &quot;asleep&quot; which is also meant to say that they aren&#39;t conscious.</p>

<p>Your view that I&#39;m simply throwing shit for no reason is an alternative fact.</p>

<p>For example, you guys are currently sure that Podesta tortured some kid on video. Using the statistical history of your predictive ability, I can say with a 99% certainty that it&#39;s completely false. Nothing will come from it, yet that won&#39;t stop your future confidence. It should.</p>

<p>We are Critical Thinkers, and therefore, this is what we live by:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It is the mark of an educated mind to be able to entertain a thought without accepting it. – Aristotle.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So we &#39;entertain&#39; the idea/possibility that Podesta is a Pedo because of a TON of clues, Spirit Cooking, the &#39;artwork,&#39; Hastert, codewords/wikileaks, and, you know, stories like this:</p>

<p>Thant get covered up and swept under the rug.</p>

<p>Personally, I&#39;d bet $10K that Podesta will eventually be outed as a Pedo, but that&#39;s just me. I admit I could be wrong about it, but that&#39;s the beauty of being a &#39;thought/possibility entertainer.&#39;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It really is quite lonely. I am slowly trying to wake my girlfriend up. I had my first experience of seeing someone brain literally REFUSE to listen to the information I was providing.</p>

<p>I have gotten her to agree that we at least knew about 9/11 and let it happen and probably demolished the buildings. She believes in some of pizzagate as far as the highly organized international trafficking of children.</p>

<p>Then, I tried to red pill her on the Boston Bombing. Being from Mass, she was really affected by it. As I am telling her all of the inconsistencies, I could see it on her face and in her eyes that she literally could not go any further. Her brain hit a wall. </p>

<p>It was a strange sight but now I can see that that really happens to people and they literally just can&#39;t believe some of this shit to be true.</p>
