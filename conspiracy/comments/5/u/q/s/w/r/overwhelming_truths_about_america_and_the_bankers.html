        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>There exists a bank called the Bank for International Settlement&#39;s, which the central banks of the world have accounts in and their reserves are backed by gold, while ours are backed by nothing. The current member from the US&#39;s privately owned Federal Reserve is Ben Bernanke. Members of the BIS are subject only to international law. They facilitate trade from one government to another and allowed for Germany to transfer money from the Austrian gov when they invaded Austria in WWII. A portion of the bank is owned by undisclosed private shareholders whom many believe to be members of the Rothschild family</p>

<p>As soon as our parents sign the original version (not any copies) of our birth certificate, we are owned by a company called UNITED STATES INC which is our federal government (not actually a government, its a corporation owned by the Federal Reserve banks) and was made possible by the (Act of 1871). Our birth certificates are on the stock market right now in mutual funds. I found mine in a Fidelity fund. Supposedly the UCC1 form (Universal Commercial Code) allows us to purchase our birth certificate, releasing us from the legal control of the gov. (I havent proven this part yet)  </p>

<p>These documents are NOT secret! They ARE a matter of Public Record.
HERE ARE TRUTHFUL FACTS MOST PEOPLE DO NOT KNOW, .... BUT SHOULD…  </p>

<ol>
<li><p>The IRS is Not a US government agency.  It is an agency of the IMF (International Monetary Fund) (Diversified Metal Products v I.R.S et al.  CV-93-405E-EJE U.S.D.C.D.I., Public Law 94-564, Senate report 94-1148 pg. 5967, Reorganization Plan No. 26, Public Law 102-391)  </p></li>
<li><p>The IMF (International Monetary Fund) is an agency of the U.N. (Black’s Law Dictionary 6th Ed. page 816)  </p></li>
<li><p>The United States has NOT had a Treasury since 1921 (41 Stat. Ch 214 page 654)  </p></li>
<li><p>The U.S. Treasury is now the IMF (International Monetary Fund) (Presidential Documents Volume 24-No. 4 page 113, 22 U.S.C. 285-2887)  </p></li>
<li><p>The United States does not have any employees because there is no longer a United States! No more reorganizations. After over 200 years of bankruptcy it is finally over. (Executive Order 12803)  </p></li>
<li><p>The FCC, CIA, FBI, NASA and all of the other alphabet gangs were never  part of the U.S. government, even though the “U.S. Government” held stock in the agencies. (U.S. v Strang, 254 US491 Lewis v. US, 680 F.2nd, 1239)  </p></li>
<li><p>Social Security Numbers are issued by the U.N. through the IMF (International Monetary Fund). The application for a Social Security Number is the SS5 Form. The Department of the Treasury (IMF) issues the SS5 forms and not the Social Security Administration. The new SS5 forms do not state who publishes them while the old form states they are “Department of the Treasury”. (20 CFR (Council on Foreign Relations) Chap. 111 Subpart B. 422.103 (b))  </p></li>
<li><p>There are NO Judicial Courts in America and have not been since 1789. Judges do not enforce Statutes and Codes. Executive Administrators enforce Statutes and Codes. (FRC v. GE 281 US 464 Keller v. PE 261 US 428, 1 Stat 138-178)  </p></li>
<li><p>There have NOT been any judges in America since 1789. There have just been administrators.  (FRC v. GE 281 US 464 Keller v. PE 261 US 428 1 Stat. 138-178)  </p></li>
<li><p>According to GATT (The General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade) you MUST have a Social Security number. (House Report (103-826)  </p></li>
<li><p>New York City is defined in Federal Regulations as the United Nations. Rudolph Guiliani stated on C-Span that “New York City is the capital of the World.” For once, he told the truth. (20 CFR (Council on Foreign Relations) Chap. 111, subpart B 44.103 (b) (2) (2) )  </p></li>
<li><p>Social Security is not insurance or a contract, nor is there a Trust Fund.  (Helvering v. Davis 301 US 619 Steward Co. v. Davis 301 US 548)  </p></li>
<li><p>Your Social Security check comes directly from the IMF (International Monetary Fund), which is an agency of the United Nations. (It says “U.S. Department of Treasury” at the top left corner, which again is part of the U.N. as pointed out above)  </p></li>

<p>14.You own NO property!!! Slaves can’t own property. Read carefully the Deed to the property you think is yours.  You are listed as a TENANT. (Senate Document 43, 73rd Congress 1st Session) </p>

<ol>
<li><p>The most powerful court in America is NOT the United States Supreme court, but rather the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania. (42 PA. C.S.A. 502)  </p></li>
<li><p>The King of England financially backed both sides of the American Revolutionary War..   (Treaty of Versailles-July 16, 1782 Treaty of Peace 8 Stat 80)</p></li>
<li><p>You CANNOT use the U.S. Constitution to defend yourself because you are NOT a party to it!  The U.S. Constitution applies to the CORPORATION OF THE UNITED STATES, a privately owned and operated corporation (headquartered out of Washington, DC) much like IBM (International Business Machines, Microsoft, et al) and NOT to the people of the sovereign Republic of the united States of America.  (Padelford Fay &amp; Co. v The Mayor and Alderman of the City of Savannah 14 Georgia 438, 520)</p></li>
<li><p>America is a British Colony. The United States is a corporation, not a land mass and it existed before the Revolutionary War and the British Troops did not leave until 1796 (Republica v. Sweers 1 Dallas 43, Treaty of Commerce 8 Stat 116, Treaty of Peace 8 Stat 80, IRS Publication 6209, Articles of Association October 20, 1774)  </p></li>

<li><p>Britain is owned by the Vatican. (Treaty of 1213)  </p></li>
<li><p>The Pope can abolish any law in the United States (Elements of Ecclesiastical Law Vol. 1, 53-54)  </p></li>
<li><p>A 1040 Form is for tribute paid to Britain (IRS Publication 6209)  </p></li>
<li><p>The Pope claims to own the entire planet through the laws of conquest and discovery.  (Papal Bulls of 1495 &amp; 1493)  </p></li>
<li><p>The Pope has ordered the genocide and enslavement of millions of people.(Papal Bulls of 1455 &amp; 1493)  &#39;</p></li>
<li><p>The Pope’s laws are obligatory on everyone.  (Bened. XIV., De Syn. Dioec, lib, ix, c. vii, n. 4. Prati, 1844 Syllabus Prop 28, 29, 44)  </p></li>
<li><p>We are slaves and own absolutely nothing, NOT even what we think are our children.  (Tillman vs. Roberts 108 So. 62, Van Koten vs. Van Koten 154 N.E. 146, Senate Document 438 73rd Congress 1st Session, Wynehammer v. People 13 N.Y. REP 378, 481)  </p></li>
<li><p>Military dictator George Washington divided up the States (Estates) in to Districts  (Messages and papers of the Presidents Volume 1 page 99 1828 Dictionary of Estate)  </p></li>
<li><p>“The People” does NOT include you and me. (Barron vs. Mayor and City Council of Baltimore 32 U.S. 243)  </p></li>
<li><p>It is NOT the duty of the police to protect you. Their job is to protect THE CORPORATION and arrest code breakers. (SAPP vs. Tallahassee, 348 So. 2nd. 363, REiff vs. City of Phila. 477 F. 1262, Lynch vs. NC Dept. of Justice 376 S.E. 2nd. 247)  </p></li>
<li><p>Every thing in the “United States” is up for sale: bridges, roads, water, schools, hospitals, prisons, airports, etc, etc… Did anybody take time to check who bought Klamath Lake?? (Executive Order 12803)  &#39;</p></li>
<li><p>“We are human capital” (Executive Order 13037)  The world cabal makes money off of the use of your signatures on mortgages, car loans, credit cards, your social security number, etc.   </p></li>
<li><p>The U.N. – United Nations – has financed the operations of the United States government (the corporation of THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA) for over 50 years (U.S. Department of Treasury is part of the U.N. see above) and now owns every man, woman and child in America.
The U.N. also holds all of the land of America in Fee Simple.
The good news is we don’t have to fulfill “our” fictitious obligations. You can discharge a fictitious obligation with another’s fictitious obligation.  </p></li>

<p><strong>much of the following cannot be proven, but hours and hours of research through dozens of websites in a few different languages as well as online books suggest its true</strong> and if so, the net worth of the Rothschilds is trillions of dollars, all in one family. They would have no trouble erasing most records of themselves considering they took power in the early 1800s and could control what was taught in textbooks as well as tv. You will definitely not see them on any Forbes lists</p>

<p>Most of the world is already owned unfortunately. Our Federal Reserve Banks are privately owned by the Bank of England and the Bank of France which are owned by the Rothschilds. Nathan R crashed the British market when he sold all his gov bonds based on knowing the outcome of the war against Napoleon before anyone else. Everyone panic sold and he bought most of the bonds in circulation, but nobody know how large his share is. In 1830 the French had a revolution and Nathans brother James, already having paid for the railroads in France, Loaned the new government and unknown amount of money as well as in 1834. The French had been selling bonds government bonds through London and back to French investors and James supposedly made his move but there is no proof. He also become the banker for King Leopold of Belgium before marrying his niece and passing the bank on to 2 of his sons who did the same
James and Nathans brothers were: Amschel of Germany, Carl of Naples, and Salomon of Austria. Their father literally changed the world by sending his sons off with the goal of owning a centralized bank in every country. They have funded every war since, both sides if possible like they did the civil war and the war of 1812 which is how we owe them both. They loan our federal gov, which is literally a corporation called UNITED STATE INC. look it up (Act of 1871), all federal reserve notes to our gov with interest. Woodrow Wilson sold us to the Fed with the Federal Reserve Act of 1913 and later apologized for it. Income tax was created the same year, and is used to pay the interest on the loans the Fed gives the government.</p>

<p>Also, oil is supposedly not an organic compound and the idea of fossil fuel was promoted in a meeting in Geneva in 1892 by Rockefeller and his hired scientists (funded by rothschild). Colonel L. Fletcher seems very genuine to me and likely has no reason to lie. He says that petroleum is abiotic and contains no organic compounds and it is the second most common liquid on earth. I believe him considering weve had the technology for alternative fuel sources for almost a century. Tesla even had a method of free energy that was derived from the sky in the ionized layers above the clouds I believe as well as a few other discoveries that were kept hidden when he died by one of the bigger families (cant remember if it was rockefeller, rothschild or who) <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LWuWqscwhb4">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LWuWqscwhb4</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>Indeed. The countries weve been conditioned to dislike are all countries that have resisted letting banks in. Russia, China, Iran, N Korea, etc. The reason were in the middle east is to create centralized banks where there were none. Iraq and Afghanistan now have private central banks. We are letting Palestine get bombed to pieces because Israel is in charge of the banks. They profit of the biggest military in the world while we protect them. They make money on every aspect of everything. Its really quite a feat if you think about it. Less than 250 years and not that many generations to achieve world control</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There were also PoW camps in the US for captured Axis power soldiers. I doubt the Holocaust was faked, though there is a possibility that the Rothschilds groomed and cultivated the Nazi party. There are plenty of opportunities for it to have been carried out. </p>

<p>The art board that denied Hitler schooling could have easily been payed off, and not for financially significant numbers. This isn&#39;t an unheard tactic, it&#39;s what caused the start of proxy wars in the ME between Russia and the US. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>6 Britain is not owned by the Vatican. 1689 Bill of Rights redefined the monarch&#39;s role and emphasized Parliament&#39;s. It also barred any future Catholic monarch from taking the throne. The current monarch is head of the Church of England,  which King Henry created when he told the RC church to fuck off. The Vatican most definitely owns valuable chunks of the UK through its land holdings and other interests but it does not own the country - that would be the banks I reckon</p>

    <div class="md"><p>but if the same bankers who control the Vatican are also in England then what does it matter? I see the point youre making, but the details of who owns who is irrelevant because its all the same. I dont mean to take any shots at the British. Americans are just as owned as you are. Were all heading towards this bizarre form of fascism disguised as superior morality. Instead of understanding natural human behaviors like racism and hatred (natural meaning these behaviors contributed to our evolution) and educating people on ways to overcome it, there are a growing number of people who believe suppressing it through laws and regulations, so they dont have to see it themselves, will actually solve any problems and not just force these behaviors to be done in privacy or away from media</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No shots taken! I do see what you are saying and I will be honest and say I really have no idea - this shit gets so murky over the centuries I doubt it&#39;s possible to get a clear idea. You could argue that corps run the show, but then who owns them? Do the chains of control go back centuries to monarchs and popes borrowing cash and then making all kinds of concessions to the lenders?</p>

<p>Probably - although with the reputed wealth of the Vatican I would be surprised if any mere banking house could own them... except perhaps for the biggest of them all - those of the red shield?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I can see no reason to not believe its the red shield. No other family exists whos past is claimed to be a myth. Its not that hard to find out how they got into each central bank, but its impossible to find how they got out like they claim. Jacob said the great mistake his family made was not following up on their operation in America and thats a load of shit right there even if you dont count loans from the Bank of England. His family invested heavily in industry through our tycoons like Rockefeller, Carnegie and Morgan. So for him to say that makes his case even weaker. Just watch how disingenuous he sounds during <a href="https://youtu.be/KWuegjAUBxQ?t=24m21s">this documentary</a> when this (painfully awkward) American interviewer sympathizes with him for whatever reason. That sounds to me like an old man trying to create an emotion he has never truly experienced before</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh I agree - those fuckers would clearly fit the bill no worries. Its impossible to estimate their combined wealth as they&#39;re too clever to end up on any &#39;top x&#39; rich list but recent guesses were up to $2 trillion, but only educated guesses at that. I don&#39;t know if they own Rome but since I was harping on about the UK monarchy I&#39;ll just leave this here <a href="https://m.imgur.com/reLdwNx?r">https://m.imgur.com/reLdwNx?r</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>I believe there are family members with holdings in central banks and there are family members with business holdings not involved with central banks. Mayer Amschel was so successful with his sons because they spread out so losses by one could not bring them all down.

<p>I have seen that picture before and I believe there a similar picture/video with the queen too. The royal family believe they have divine right is that correct? If so then what does that say about Evelyn&#39;s own belief of where his place is in the system? It would be one thing to do this in private, but in person? Thats world gangster status.

    <div class="md"><p>Considering that the solution already exists and ready to be implemented, I&#39;m still hopeful.</p>

<p>Just as the ecosystem recovered after the fall of gox and became resilient to disasters like that (mtgox handled about 80% of the fiat/btc trade before it collapsed), and the fall of SR1, which was the first real world use case of Bitcoin and it&#39;s fall gave way to a myriad of DNMs, I feel the destruction of the tyrannic and compromised Core implementation will net us diverse and resilient development scene which cannot be influenced by petty politics.</p>

<p>Currently Core&#39;s 2 leverages are the temporary 1MB limit and the censorship of the theymos owned forums.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Very interesting post. I think it will take a lot of time to verify some of the things you&#39;ve said but I can totally see most of it being true. I&#39;ve always been skeptical of central banking for a few reasons. 
As a economics student no one has ever been able to adequately explain to me why our currency must continually inflated each year and this is considered &quot;healthy and normal&quot; for the economy. Furthermore every professor ignores the debt massive of the US and justifies it by saying that deficit spending is good for the economy and that decreasing gov&#39;t spending will ruin the livelihoods of normal people. Never mind that it&#39;s normal people who will suffer when the US finally defaults. Where does the majority of government spending go anyway? The military who seems to have no goal in mind but to destabilize the middle east. The interests of the people and the military have long since diverged. Why does everyone ignore the fact that we&#39;ve been at war for 15 years? Who is benefiting from bankrupting our nation. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Great list. I know they like to think they &quot;own&quot; me, or whatever. But, what does that mean? I tend to think that ownership over a person can only be granted to another by the person themselves, otherwise it&#39;s meaningless. What good is it to &#39;own&#39; a car that only started when it felt like it, only turned left if asked politely or threatened with destruction.</p>

<p>It&#39;s meaningless unless both parties are aware and agree to it, and even then it&#39;s meaningless. Domination on the other hand seems more relevant, but yet I remain not dominated. I&#39;m only pretending to be a citizen &#39;on board&#39; in order to avoid any hot conflict with the cubby-house kings who think their saying things makes them true.</p>

<p>It&#39;s all moot. In my movie, TPTB are more like actors in a play for dumb people, and within its mighty scope, more like a hornet&#39;s nest that looks foreboding, but can be avoided easily.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Both parties do not have to be aware to agree. Look at the birth certificate stuff. </p>

<p>Either way you may like to think youre avoiding being owned, but unless you live entirely independent of everything (like no property, no fuel use, no under the table money, no contribution to society whatsoever) then you still are owned. Slavery today means something entirely different than before. This is intellogical slavery</p>
