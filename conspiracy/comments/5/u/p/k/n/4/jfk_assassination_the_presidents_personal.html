        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Dr. George Burkley was the personal physician of John F. Kennedy, as well as Dwight D. Eisenhower and Lyndon B. Johnson. He witnessed Kennedy&#39;s autopsy, and verified the <a href="https://www.history-matters.com/archive/jfk/arrb/master_med_set/md6/html/Image0.htm">death certificate</a> and <a href="https://i.imgur.com/HdrCpBY.jpg">the autopsy face sheet, which is stained in his blood</a> (that&#39;s his signature on the bottom-left corner). </p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_F._Kennedy_autopsy">Wikipedia article - John F. Kennedy autopsy</a></p>

<p>Dr. Burkley was not called to testify to the Warren Commission or the House Select Committee on Assassinations. The following comments made by him may show why. </p>

<p>1967 oral history interview:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>McHUGH: &quot;I see. Do your conclusions differ at all with the Warren report of the circumstances or cause of death?&quot;</em></p>

<p><em>BURKLEY: &quot;My conclusion in regard to the cause of death was the bullet wound which involved the skull. The discussion as to whether a previous bullet also enters into it, but as far as the cause of death the immediate cause was unquestionably the bullet which shattered the brain and the calvariurm.&quot;</em></p>

<p><em>McHUGH: &quot;I see. The brain and the what?&quot;</em></p>

<p><em>BURKLEY: &quot;And the skull, calvarium.&quot;</em></p>

<p><em>MCHUGH: &quot;I see. Do you agree with the Warren Report on the number of bullets that entered the President&#39;s body?&quot;</em></p>

<p><em>BURKLEY: &quot;I would not care to be quoted on that.&quot;</em></p>

<p>1977 HSCA interview report:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>...<em>The doctors didn&#39;t section the brain and if it had been done, it might be able to prove whether or not there were two bullets. Dr. Burkley thinks there was one but concedes of the possibility of there having been two.</em></p>

<p>Burkley&#39;s affidavit to the HSCA:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>Had the Warren Commission deemed to call me, I would have stated why I retained the brain and the possibility of two bullets having wounded President John F. Kennedy&#39;s brain would have been eliminated.</em></p>

<p>Here is an official memo from HSCA staffer Richard Sprauge:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>From: Richard Sprague
To: File
March 18, 1977</p>

<p>William F. Illig, an attorney from Erie, Pa., contacted me in Philadelphia this date, advising me that he represents Dr. George G. Burkley, Vice Admiral, U.S. Navy retired, who had been the personal physician for presidents Kennedy and Johnson.</p>

<p>Mr. Illig stated that he had a luncheon meeting with his client, Dr. Burkley, this date to take up some tax matters. <strong>Dr. Burkley advised him that although he, Burkley, had signed the death certificate of President Kennedy in Dallas, he had never been interviewed and that he has information in the Kennedy assassination indicating that others besides Oswald must have participated.</strong></p>

<p>Illig advised me that his client is a very quiet, unassuming person, not wanting any publicity whatsoever, but he, Illig, was calling me with his client’s consent and that his client would talk to me in Washington.</p>

<p>Author Henry Hurt wrote in his book <em>Reasonable Doubt</em> of a short interview with Burkley:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>It is significant that Dr. Burkley had been with the President in Dallas, with him in the Parkland Hospital emergency room, with his body as it was flown east, and present during the autopsy. It is also significant that even though he was the only doctor present both at Parkland and at Bethesda, Dr. Burkley&#39;s testimony was never taken by the Warren Commission, nor was it taken later by the House Select Committee.</em></p>

<p><strong>In 1982 Dr. Burkley told the author in a telephone conversation that he believed that President Kennedy&#39;s assassination was the result of a conspiracy.</strong></p>

<p><em>This startling statement, after so long a silence, amplified an obscure exchange Dr. Burkley had in an oral-history interview on file at the Kennedy Library in Boston.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>And also wrote in an endnote:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>When he originally telephoned the author, Dr. Burkley expressed his willingness to discuss various matters concerning the assassination. He asked for a letter detailing the areas the author wished to discuss. Dr. Burkley acknowledged receipt of the letter with a letter of his own. Two months later, the author proposed a meeting with Dr. Burkley to discuss the points. The doctor responded with an abrupt refusal to discuss any aspect of the case.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>In Michael L. Kurtz&#39;s book <em>The JFK Assassination Debates: Lone Gunman Versus Conspiracy</em>, it also says this (I do not have a link to the full ebook), this is excerpted from <a href="http://krusch.com/books/Impossible_Case_Against_Lee_Harvey_Oswald.pdf">Barry Krusch&#39;s 3-volume series on JFK</a>: </p>

<blockquote>
<p>... <em>When informed that if this were true, then the assassin who fired that shot must have been located in front of the president, Burkley stated that he always believed in a conspiracy, a remark that he had previously made to another assassin researcher, Henry Hurt. However, he quickly terminated the conversation without providing any details.</em></p>

    <div class="md"><p>I mean, there was no evidence of toxins in his system. And no evidence of any dart injury to the exclusion of a bullet or a fragment. I think it&#39;s more likely that his injuries were severe enough at the beginning of the shooting that he couldn&#39;t duck. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Seems they were not as complete as they should normally be at the loss of head of state.  This article mentioned that the brain quadrants were not all searched.  Yesterday&#39;s article mentioned the dart to the neck was lost and any damage to the next was obscured by the damage of the autopsy.  The original receipt mentioned the wound but the transcript did not.  The dart found was lost.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, the brain was not properly sectioned, however I think you can prove two headshots with just the head X-ray and brain photographs. </p>

<p>The receipt you mention is here: <a href="http://aarclibrary.org/publib/jfk/arrb/master_med_set/md69/html/md69_0001a.htm">http://aarclibrary.org/publib/jfk/arrb/master_med_set/md69/html/md69_0001a.htm</a></p>

<p>It simple refers to a &quot;missile&quot;. When questioned about this decades later, the FBI agents Sibert and O&#39;Neil claimed that by &quot;missile&quot;, they just meant two small bullet fragments. </p>

<p>There is no way of knowing the throat wound was an entry of a dart, to the exclusion of a bullet entry or a fragment exiting. Some are convinced that a whole bullet could exit and leave the wound a tiny 4-5 millimeters like that. </p>

<p>The Parkland hospital doctors performed a tracheotomy at the location of the bullet hole, by Dr. Perry&#39;s statements he incised it <em>below</em> the throat wound. There is some controversy over whether the large neck incision noted at the autopsy was the same incision the doctors at Parkland hospital made. According to researcher David Lifton, Dr. Perry was shown an autopsy photograph of Kennedy&#39;s face and neck for a CBS interview, to which he shook his head and said &quot;<em>I left the wound</em> <strong>inviolate</strong>&quot;, meaning that you could still see the basic outline of the throat hole beneath the neck incision. A copy of the audio tape for this CBS interview was allegedly altered by someone to make Dr. Perry sound like he said &quot;<em>I left the wound</em> <strong>invalid</strong>&quot;, meaning the exact opposite. Lifton has a new book coming out soon so maybe he&#39;ll tell the full story and prove all of this then. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve been a believer that while Lee did take two shots from his nest (one hitting the road, the other hitting JFK), the third bullet which killed JKF was from an SS agent that had stumbled in the car behind him, causing him to accidentally squeeze the trigger of his rifle. I&#39;ve seen a CG rendering of the positioning of the car, the SS agent, and the angle that third shot came from, and some video of the agent in question and it all lines up. </p>

<p>There&#39;s no way the gov&#39;t would admit that JFK was killed by one of their own, and due to an accident of all things. Especially not when they have Lee in custody.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I mean, no offense to you, but what kind of country do we live in when people could reasonably believe that rather than believe there are other gunmen at large? Fancy computer cartoons like that are designed to make the average viewer believe stuff like that. It&#39;s the Television equivalent of Nestle hiring people in white overcoats to convince poor villages that baby formula is better than breastfeeding. </p>

<p>The expert who proposed that theory believes that the entry wound on the back of the head was 4 inches higher than the autopsy report, the testimonies of the 3 autopsy surgeons, and autopsy witnesses place it. The entry wound was low in the head, and from the official films and x-ray I think it&#39;s easy to gather than it had no relation to the large wound on the top-right side of the head. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Here are the people that saw Kennedy at Parkland hospital:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.whokilledjfk.net/Navigation/b%20O%20H.htm">Doctors and Nurses at Parkland Hospital</a></p>

<p>Can we agree that they indicate back of the head. San&#39;t get better evidence that thar.</p>

<p>They all say that JFK had a big gaping hole in the back of his head. That would indicate that the big hole was an exit wound. This means that the head shot came from the front, not the back. You don&#39;t have a big gaping entrance hole and a little exit hole.</p>

<p>Discovery Channel did a recreation of the magic bullet trajectory. They said it proved the magic bullet was possible. The reality is that it proves that the magic bullet is impossible.</p>

<p>Please look at this still frame from that show:</p>

<p><a href="http://i1.ytimg.com/vi/Hgec6oCdIvE/hqdefault.jpg">http://i1.ytimg.com/vi/Hgec6oCdIvE/hqdefault.jpg</a></p>

<p>Notice that the bullet hits Kennedy in the back where it should, and it hits Connelly where it should. Then look at where the bullet exits Kennedy&#39;s body. The official theory said it exited Kennedy&#39;s neck as all the photos show. In the recreation their bullet exits Kennedy at the sternum. This is where the bullet would exit Kennedy from a shot from the book depository. Their recreation inadvertently proves that the official theory is impossible. And of course they declined to comment on this proof.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I understand how the witnesses are pretty unanimous in describing the head wound as being posterior. I&#39;m wondering if so many of them could have thought the wound was behind the ear because it <em>was</em> behind the ear- from their point of view, with Kennedy laying down, head tilted back. I think you can prove a conspiracy either way. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hi there! Great post! If you see the footage from Parkland the doctors all give an example of the exit wound. They&#39;re all talking (one by one) and when they mention the exit wound they all point to the same place. The back of the head. Always found that interesting.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Such a widespread conflicting description of the head wound could be explained by either a massive cover-up or some kind of optical illusion. I think that perhaps if Kennedy was laying down and had his held tilted back, the Parkland and Autopsy witnesses could&#39;ve thought that the wound was behind the ear, involving the occipital area. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Could be. I wasn&#39;t there so I can&#39;t say for sure! I do find it odd that so many medical professionals would point to the exact same place though. </p>

<p>That said, I saw a documentary that would back up your claim. It was guys who developed (not sure that&#39;s the right word) the Zapruder film. They actually worked for the government and said that the Zapruder film we see is not the original footage. The witnesses seemed very credible and claimed that a large piece of skull flew upward on the fatal shot. </p>
