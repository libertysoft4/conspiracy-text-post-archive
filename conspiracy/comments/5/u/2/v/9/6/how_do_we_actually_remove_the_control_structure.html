        <p><span class="badge badge-primary">30</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;2017-02-14 by <a class="author" href="../../../../../../../../user/meat_for_the_beast.html">meat_for_the_beast</a></p>
        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>You and I both know that we&#39;re living inside a system of complete control... Since the internet has come around, we have been able to access information that has been kept secret and see real things that have been distorted and lied about by those in control. We are basically able to see the actual system of control in action... For me, it&#39;s been since 2007.</p>

<p>For nearly 10 years now I have been seeing the world through different eyes... and especially in the last couple of years I have noticed the wave of &quot;awakening&quot; happening more and more. Now, since the night of the US Election, the wave has increased even more! We all go through those phases (denial, anger, bargaining, depression and finally acceptance) and I would say this recent surge is in the anger phase but aren&#39;t really scaling it back to the full picture yet... I see so many rants back and forth about the left or the right or the whatever but forget it is all within this system of control.</p>

<p>The whole damn system needs to change and especially the people running this system... But how do we actually do anything about this. They (sort of) allow protesting but that can easily be manipulated by provocateur groups. They have petitions that they look at if a certain amount of people sign them and can easily dismiss and delay and avoid actually doing anything significant...</p>

<p>What I think we need to do is... no longer participate. Now, you don&#39;t just quit your job and walk off into the forest... but you work way out of this system at a decent gradual pace to a point where you are no longer dependent on it:</p>

<ul>
<li>Start to phase out your connection to banks. Get rid of debt, start using cryptocurrency instead of your debit card or cash. Eventually build relationships with your local community to barter/trade goods &amp; services you need.</li>
<li>Research and invest in self-generating energy and storage. Lower your electrical bill to almost nothing and reach the point where you have a surplus of stored power. One example is solar panels and salt water batteries.</li>
<li>Research and invest in water storage and filtration. Lower your water bill to almost nothing and reach the point where you have a surplus of clean, drinkable water. One example is rain barrels into a large cistern and finally into a water filtration system.</li>
<li>Research and invest in climate-controlled greenhouse technology. Start growing and producing your own food. Again, barter/trade with your local community to get the rest of the food you need. One example is an underground aquaponic system where you have fish and vegetables supporting each other and you harvest as needed.</li>
</ul>

<p>Basically, if we all spent more time on being actual human beings living off the land, utilizing technology to produce and manage resources, and participate in a local community to fully support one another... all of these major issues would dissipate into the nothingness that it all really is.</p>

<p>We have countless meaningless jobs that allows us to live in disconnected and toxic cities where everyone is in everyone else&#39;s way. We have completely lost touch with our humanity and what it means to be a living human being on planet earth. We have made our way of life too complicated and filled with meaningless stuff... so that we all just play along in this current shit-show while this tiny group of elite get all the abundance of wealth from our hard work.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is true, certainly. But bad government is directly related to subversion. It&#39;s not that we are evil people. We haven&#39;t even rebelled or used violence, because we are not evil, unlike our government.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Agenda 21 is trying to destroy every good point you made. They don&#39;t allow people to have gardens in cities, it&#39;s illegal to burn wood for heat, and collecting rain water is illegal. Hell the government of Wyoming claims they own the wind and are taxing wind energy. </p>

<p>We need to do exactly what you posted but they have already been fighting to bring that down before we get there. These elite fuckers are smart</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Great post op. This has been on my mind for quite awhile actually. One of my buddies and I have been discussing everything in your bullet points, and he actually bit the bullet and does all of the above. He&#39;s pretty much off the grid completely now. I would be too, but my wife is blissfully ignorant and enjoys the concrete jungle lol. </p>

<p>I think alot of people are waking up, but I could be totally wrong since I&#39;m always in this sub or YouTube. I was just watching a Nasa press conference and the comments section was 100% shit talking them for their fraud, so I have hope. Either way, in time everyone will be awake. Once the baby boomers are all gone probably. I don&#39;t think they could take or censor the net too much without a revolution. The cabal will probably just double down and be even more obvious imo. </p>
