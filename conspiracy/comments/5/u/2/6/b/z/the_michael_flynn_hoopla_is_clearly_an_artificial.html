    <div class="md"><p>Memes? Buzzwords? Like Flynn being the third guy associated with Trump to resign over allegations and connections to Russia, and how he lied to Mike Pence about it? What do you say about his nomination of Ajit Pai to the head of the FCC (openly going after net neutrality)? Is that a meme or a buzzword that&#39;s worth being critical about? </p>

<p>He&#39;s appointed a <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/donald-trumps-pick-for-health-secretary-traded-medical-stocks-while-in-house-1482451061">corrupt</a> politician (Tom Price) as head of health and human services. Is that a meme I missed on r/Clinton (a subreddit I was banned from)?</p>

<p>His economic team is filled with <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-12-22/goldman-is-back-on-top-in-the-trump-administration">Goldman Sachs</a> executives (which he openly railed against during his campaign). </p>

<p>...He&#39;s come out in support of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6CsSiD2hHM&amp;amp;feature=youtu.be">civil asset forfeiture</a> without a conviction. Is that not a travesty to every self-respecting citizen?</p>

<p>Yes, he&#39;s shit all over himself these last 4 weeks and his Cabinet appointments are trash. Here is just a few of the complaints I have on him and his administration that I&#39;ve posted elsewhere:</p>

<li><p>Trump&#39;s <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/donald-trump-not-in-situation-room-yemen-raid-30-civilians-killed-us-navy-seal-dead-first-military-a7561596.html">botched raid</a> in Yemen was done with poor intelligence &amp; planning, leading to the death of war hero(Navy SEAL Chief Petty Officer William Owens) and failure to capture Al Qaeda Leader <a href="https://www.counterextremism.com/extremists/qasim-al-raymi">Qassim Al-Rimi</a>.

<li><p>His Secretary for Health and Human Services, Tom Price, has an insane history of political corruption that was swept under the rug: <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/donald-trumps-pick-for-health-secretary-traded-medical-stocks-while-in-house-1482451061">1</a> <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2017/02/02/hhs-nominee-tom-price-bought-stock-then-authored-bill-benefiting-company/97337838/">2</a></p></li>
<li><p>He ousted the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/29/us/stephen-bannon-donald-trump-national-security-council.html">Joint Chiefs of Staff &amp; Director of National Security</a> from his National Security Council. (This one caused a huge uproar.)</p></li>
</ol>

<p>TL;DR= I&#39;m a Trump voter. Trump fucking blows and his die-hard supporters keep deflecting to Hillary, Obama, the Liberal media, MSM, or any reason as to why Trump is an insanely flawed President. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Become President and snatch the victory away from Hillary. This has revitalized our distrust of the Executive Branch, and will allow all voters to be critical of the President. Obama put everyone to sleep. He is the reason why Trump has so much power. He&#39;s accelerated the Bush/&quot;Wolfowitz&quot; Doctrine. Trump is now at the helm and we can all start seeing the system for what it really is. The American people are waking up to corruption on all sides, and I hope that leads to us fight the corporate oligarchy in Washington. </p>

<p>Trump&#39;s election proved that you don&#39;t need more money than your opponent to win an election. You don&#39;t need the media to be your friend to win an election. You don&#39;t need to be a politician to win an election. The American people are waking up and realizing that we can beat back the corporate lobbyists, the oligarchy, and the political elites in Washington D.C. to enact actual change we probably all agree on.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>no I love hearing opinions that differ from my own actually; every time I come across one, I get to put it in a cage match with my own opinion, where the two conflicting opinions battle it out with logic and reason to the best of my mind&#39;s ability. whichever one better fits reality with the least number of contradictions wins in the end, and I adjust my worldview accordingly.</p>

<p>I nearly never completely reverse my opinion on an issue from reading or hearing just one alternative viewpoint, but I&#39;m open to exploring avenues of thought that I previously hadn&#39;t considered, because I do everything in my power to consciously detach my understanding of the world from my identity. when I&#39;m proven wrong about something, it doesn&#39;t hurt my feelings; I&#39;m grateful that I&#39;ve been provided with deeper insight into how the world works and a better understanding of everything.</p>

<p>that said, when I notice that a certain user keeps popping up thread after thread, regurgitating the same buzzwords that stick out like sore thumbs, like &quot;God Emperor&quot; (as much as people want to say that <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> has been &quot;overrun&quot; by <a href="/r/The_Donald">/r/The_Donald</a>, I haven&#39;t seen anyone unironically refer to him as such here), I RES-tag them with a pink &quot;maybe shill&quot; tag.</p>

<p>if I continue to see the same user continue the same pattern of behavior, which will often include shaming people for not subscribing to the mainstream media&#39;s &quot;conspiracy theories&quot;, then I change the tag to a fuschia &quot;shill&quot;, so I can safely ignore anything they have to say.</p>

<p>it&#39;s a pretty good system that helps me separate the wheat from the chaff. this subreddit is far from perfect and, in fact, its quality is rapidly going downhill, but there are still a few users who post quality content here, and I continue to subscribe because of such content.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t suddenly believe everything bad about him. I&#39;m being objective dude. I seriously was a Trump voter, supporter, and r/T_D shitposter. I don&#39;t mind his travel ban, nor his stance on reducing tensions with Russia. </p>

<p>I&#39;m just saying that he has also made ALOT of mistakes than no one else seems to want to talk about. I can&#39;t talk on r/politics about it, because that sub hates Trump without reason, and I was banned from r/the_donald once I stepped out of line. At the end of the day he&#39;s the President, and I hold the Constitution and anti-corruption above all politicians </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Give me a fucking break.

He&#39;s appointed <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/05/technology/trumps-fcc-quickly-targets-net-neutrality-rules.html">Ajit Pai</a> as the head of the FCC (who will oversee the dismantling of Net Neutrality).

He approved a botched <a href="http://legalinsurrection.com/2017/02/yemen-raid-targeted-al-qaeda-leader-qassim-al-rimi/">Yemen raid</a> with terrible intelligence information leading to poor execution.

    <div class="md"><p>I will explain how the Obama administration has almost brought us to the brink of WW3. Firstly, we must understand the Russian mindset before Obama&#39;s presidency, and why (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE6rSljTwdU">geopolitically</a>) Russia has always pushed its influence westward.  </p>

<p>Then we must look at initial sources from the very beginning of the Obama administration and the Obama foreign policy doctrine with Russia. Ever since the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlDlzP6fDMs">first two years</a> of his administration, Obama (and NATO) have worked hard to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNCkfhc7mWQ">encircle</a> Russia and stir unrest in countries that border the Russian Federation, like <a href="http://www.sfgate.com/news/article/Georgia-s-oil-pipeline-is-key-to-U-S-support-3201499.php">Georgia</a> and our <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russo-Georgian_War#cite_ref-104">war games held in the Caucasus during</a> the start of Obama&#39;s presidency.</p>

<p>It didn&#39;t help that we fomented civil strife in Ukraine against Yanukovych (once he <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukraine%E2%80%93NATO_relations#cite_ref-48">declared</a> his nation non-aligned with Europe). Yanukovych was later ousted from power and Western <a href="http://www.globalresearch.ca/washington-was-behind-ukraine-coup-obama-admits-that-us-brokered-a-deal-in-support-of-regime-change/5429142">loyalists</a> who collaborated with Washington were put in his place. And now NATO is actively <a href="http://www.nato.int/nato_static_fl2014/assets/pdf/pdf_2015_12/20151130_1512-factsheet-nato-ukraine-supportr_en.pdf">supporting Ukraine</a>.</p>

<p>Here is a <a href="http://www.abc.net.au/cm/lb/5297962/data/ukraine-eu-russia-map-data.png">map</a> of Ukraine&#39;s borders with Russia. If our national policies and our NATO encirclement of Russia doesn&#39;t stop, this will only <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8PgSX-WD96Q">lead to war.</a> Russia has survived the Napoleonic invasion, WW1, and nearly collapsed in WW2 when Hitler&#39;s war machine <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Front_(World_War_II">murdered tens of millions of Serbs</a>#Casualties) in order to create Lebensraum. Russia has lost many millions of people during the last two centuries, more than any other European country. There is a reason why Putin is so hostile to the West. The Russians have been invaded many times from the West, and will <a href="http://www.dw.com/en/putin-promises-countermeasures-in-response-to-nato-expansion/a-36465534">retaliate</a> if we continue with Obama&#39;s policies.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Then why would this be the third person associated with the Trump administration to resign over connections to Russia (Manafort, Carter Page, and now Flynn)? </p>

<p>All during the election campaign &amp; during these last 4 weeks, Infowars (and a vast majority of my fellow conspiracy guys) were talking about how the patriots within the government were actively working against Hillary and the Dems to bring down the globalists/Islamists within the government. Trump purged hundreds of high level staff and put a trusted GOP, former Marine at the helm of the CIA (Pompeo), and is fighting against the pedo&#39;s. Yet, now (all of a sudden), all of these people are creating an artificial scandal? Really? Artificial?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Reposting my comment from another thread:</p>

<p>Here is what I don&#39;t understand. First, let&#39;s assume the following is true:</p>

<p>A) The DNC leaks were insider leaks and not a Russian hack</p>

<p>B) The Podesta leaks were a result of a fishing campaign that was not Russian sponsored</p>

<p>C) The Steele Dossier was based on unverified claims</p>

<p>D) The Democratic party and the MSM blitz-pumped the Russian narrative (both hacking and dossier) as a smear campaign post-election</p>

<p>E) Part of the smear campaign was to increase sanctions as a result of hacking (that for the purpose of this argument, we are assuming is not true)</p>

<p>F) Steele and Russia both know the above is true so they had a conversation to the extent of OPs post</p>

<p>So, assuming that the Trump admin and supporters would be comfortable in the above being true, why on earth would:</p>

<p>1) Flynn lie to Pence about it</p>

<p>2) The Trump admin not make the above rationalization public long ago</p>

<p>3) Why resign given the above rationalization</p>

    <div class="md"><p>not familiar with US politics so could someone please ELI5:</p>

<p>can Flynn stay as an advisor to the Pres in a new diff role some point down the line? understandable that he wont have same SC but id assume he already has a pretty high one that hasnt expired.</p>

<p>how much contact / advise can Pres have with Flynn as a private individual over issues that his current non NSA / WH SC allows? would this be a massive scandal? it seems loads of private individuals come see Pres either way (as seen with Obama) so maybe not even that discreetly but via official visits.</p>

<p>Whats preventing Flynns/Trumps foreign policy vision continuing to be in place with Flynn recommending his replacement? Is this Kellog guy a globalist? Or seemingly same view of world as Flynn?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Give me a fucking break. What about the war mongers in Trump&#39;s administration who have their eyes on Iran, and won&#39;t fall out of line with Wahabbist Islamist states like Saudi Arabia and Bahrain? The left is fucked, but be objective of what&#39;s happened to Trump. He rode the wave of populist anger and took advantage of the Infowars audience to propel himself into power. He&#39;s appointed <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/05/technology/trumps-fcc-quickly-targets-net-neutrality-rules.html">Ajit Pai</a> as the head of the FCC (who will oversee the dismantling of Net Neutrality). His economic team is filled with <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-12-22/goldman-is-back-on-top-in-the-trump-administration">Goldman Sachs</a> executives (which he openly railed against during his campaign). He&#39;s appointed a <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/donald-trumps-pick-for-health-secretary-traded-medical-stocks-while-in-house-1482451061">corrupt</a> politician (Tom Price) as head of health and human services. He ousted the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/29/us/stephen-bannon-donald-trump-national-security-council.html">Joint Chiefs of Staff &amp; Director of National Security</a> from his National Security Council. He approved a botched <a href="http://legalinsurrection.com/2017/02/yemen-raid-targeted-al-qaeda-leader-qassim-al-rimi/">Yemen raid</a> with terrible intelligence information leading to poor execution. He&#39;s even come out in support of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6CsSiD2hHM&amp;amp;feature=youtu.be">civil asset forfeiture</a> without a conviction. </p>

<p>If he wasn&#39;t going after pedo&#39;s, then he&#39;d be a true travesty.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The Trump administration is trying to make peace with Russia after Obama brought us to brink of WW3 with his provocations. Why is it now a crime to want to make peace with Russia. When did the LEFT become America&#39;s war party?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Memes? Buzzwords? Like Flynn being the third guy associated with Trump to resign over allegations and connections to Russia, and how he lied to Mike Pence about it? What do you say about his nomination of Ajit Pai to the head of the FCC (openly going after net neutrality)? Is that a meme or a buzzword that&#39;s worth being critical about? </p>

<p>He&#39;s appointed a <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/donald-trumps-pick-for-health-secretary-traded-medical-stocks-while-in-house-1482451061">corrupt</a> politician (Tom Price) as head of health and human services. Is that a meme I missed on r/Clinton (a subreddit I was banned from)?</p>

<p>His economic team is filled with <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-12-22/goldman-is-back-on-top-in-the-trump-administration">Goldman Sachs</a> executives (which he openly railed against during his campaign). </p>

<p>...He&#39;s come out in support of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6CsSiD2hHM&amp;amp;feature=youtu.be">civil asset forfeiture</a> without a conviction. Is that not a travesty to every self-respecting citizen?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ahhhh yes. Then why don&#39;t you advocate for Jeff Sessions &amp; the Justice department, the FBI, and a Congressional inquiry investigate the President and his team. I mean, he has nothing to hide. No reason why we all can&#39;t publicly know about it. It would probably improve his ratings as well. Let&#39;s agree to investigate the President between three different agencies. I mean, there is nothing to hide, right? It&#39;s all a Hillary and Obama ploy, right?</p>
