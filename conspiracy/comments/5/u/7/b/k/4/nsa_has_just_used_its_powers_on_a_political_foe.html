    <div class="md"><blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Funny you should ask that. Republican administrations before Trump did - in fact - engage in illicit communication with foreign adversaries for partisan gain. For example:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Richard Nixon&#39;s 1968 campaign colluded with the Viet Cong to extend a war Johnson wanted to end, with the inducement Nixon would truly end it. And Johnson knew that. But he decided not to act in public for fear it would cause a constitutional crisis. Nixon, for those who know their history, then proceeded to drop the most bombs of any administration prior, in a quixotic effort to win a war that ultimately proved an unwinnable quagmire. </p></li>
<li><p>Not to be outdone by Nixon, Ronald Reagan&#39;s campaign colluded with Iran to extend the Iranian Hostage Crisis right up to Reagan&#39;s inauguration day for partisan benefit. And then was later proved to have traded arms for hostages with Iran to illegally fund Contra rebel operations in Nicaragua in direct opposition to the will of congress. Thereby creating a public constitutional crisis. </p></li>
</ul>

<p>These facts of intervention in public policy by campaign members to subvert official policy were revealed after those administrations left office. </p>

<p>So, yeah. The only difference between Flynn and Trump&#39;s abuse of authority here is that they were caught red handed. Which makes them not just crooks, but also <em>incompetent crooks</em>. </p>

<p>Yet given the clown show in display by this administration, that level of incompetence shouldn&#39;t be surprising. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>What are you talking about? I was asked the factual question, &quot;And not a single person before Flynn has called a &quot;foreign adversary&quot;?&quot;</p>

<p>I answered. Two Republican administrations before did - IN FACT - do exactly the same thing. The only difference here is that this was was caught in the act. </p>

<p>I happen to think Eisenhower ran the best Republican administration of the twentieth century. I also think Hoover did a pretty good job in dealing with the aftermath of the crash of &#39;29, given congressional constraints at the time. And that Roosevelt&#39;s first term was built on implementing Hoover&#39;s policy proposals. </p>

<p>None of which equates to &#39;hating Republicans&#39;. But I sure vehemently disagree with what Nixon and Reagan did in colluding with foreign powers for partisan gain. And I sure disagree with Trump&#39;s clownshow in this administration. </p>

<p>(Sept. 2008) The New York Post has Iraqi Foreign Minister Hoshyar Zebari, on record, stating Barack Obama tried to interfere with ongoing negotiations with Iraqi leaders while on his trip to Iraq recently. While telling his supporters his plan to withdraw troops from Iraq within 16 months, Barack Obama was doing something far different while he was in Iraq. He was trying to talk Iraqi officials into delaying the agreement on a draw-down of the American military presence from Iraq, Zebari said in an interview with the New York Post. According to Iraqi Foreign Minister Hoshyar Zebari, Obama made his demand for delay a key theme of his discussions with Iraqi leaders in Baghdad in July. &quot;He asked why we were not prepared to delay an agreement until after the US elections and the formation of a new administration in Washington”.

<p>The cynic in me can’t help but believe that Obama wanted the Iraqis to hold off on sending American troops home until – presumably – he is in the Oval Office next January and can take credit for “bringing the troops home” as per his campaign platform. It’s nice to know he’s thinking of keeping one of his many campaign promises, but a little disconcerting to think that he’d try to undermine the current president in the process.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>... </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Not only should the media be making more of a fuss about this, but so should the Bush administration. Seals and fancy planes aside, Barack Obama is not yet President of the United States. And if this is how he thinks foreign policy should be conducted – on the sly – is he really the man we want officially directing such policy for the next four to eight years?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>OK, so there was one statement on the record by the then Iraqi Foreign Minister who made the claim. A denial by the then upcoming administration. But it&#39;s unclear exactly what was denied. And no substantial press followup in the years since. It&#39;s now water under the bridge as that administration is now gone. Much like similar revelations by the Nixon and Reagan administrations. </p>

<p>I&#39;d certainly like to see a historian dig through archives and conduct interviews and try to tease out a story there. It&#39;s one for historical context anyway. </p>

Yea, I am sure digging through history would uncover many of the same. 
Bottom line for me is our country is not functioning properly. Hasn&#39;t been in a very long time.Everyone is busy trying to take the other guy out. It&#39;s not healthy for the country and the only ones that will suffer are the citizens. This will not end well, IMO. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>There&#39;s a very big difference between Kennedy and Flynn, Kennedy was a sitting Senator on the Armed Services Committee. That is, he held a high role in government. But Flynn did not. Furthermore, Kennedy was not a candidate for President. Nor did he win and attempt to derail policy of a sitting President right before transition of power. </p>

<p>Here&#39;s a fairly reasonable article on the accusations of Kennedy&#39;s intervention:</p>

<p>I count this as perhaps true but not a Logan Act violation. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s the CIA, but yeah, you&#39;re right. This isn&#39;t new, we&#39;ve been subverted since they killed Kennedy.</p>

<p>You might not like Trump, but I think anyone in this sub should like Flynn. He blew the whistle on the US funding ISIS.</p>

<p>Are there any followups to this? One story is pretty thin. But I sure wouldn&#39;t support that conduct from Obama either. </p>
