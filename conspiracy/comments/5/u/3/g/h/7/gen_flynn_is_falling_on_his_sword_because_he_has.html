        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Anyone doubting Flynn spoke to Russia about the sanctions is very naive. Trump almost certainly knew about it as well. I will explain it:</p>

<p>First, the sanctions are bullshit! Obama placed those sanctions on Russia for &quot;HACKING THE US ELECTIONS&quot;. Something that NEVER happened. Most sane people know and understand those sanctions were put in place to take the heat off of the DNC, after they got caught fucking Sanders over in the primaries. It gives all the angry snowflakes some place to direct their fury other than the DNC and his administration. The angry left snowflakes are more than happy to comply, because none of them want to face the ugly truth of just how fucked up the DNC is! YOU MUST NOT FORGET THAT! ITS KEY TO WHAT IS HAPPENING!</p>

<p>Trump and everyone close to him, has known without doubt that Russia had nothing to do with hacking our elections. Everyone in Trumps Group knows the sanctions are bullshit. THAT is why Trump had Flynn talk to the Russians to figure the best way to ease/lift the sanctions without looking like a tool. </p>

<p>Gen Flynn is only being a good soldier, and is falling on his sword for his commander in chief. Just like with Iran/Contra; Col Oliver North fell on the sword for HIS commander in chief. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you use terms like &quot;snowflakes,&quot; your non-partisan, objective credibility kind of evaporates. Your whole argument reads like Sean Spicer bringing down the hammer. Regardless of whether or not the sanctions were valid, Flynn made his first calls the day they were announced, then you&#39;ll Trump ended up dropping them anyway last week. Why was it so imperative to have those distinct sanctions dropped? I believe they were entirely FSB related. Why the rush to have the conversation? Then, why lie about it in the first place, to the press and to Pence? </p>

<p>As he has become the last beacon of truth for some folks around here, I&#39;m pretty sure the last time Trump mentioned Russia snagging DNC/Podesta material HE SAID HE DID BELIEVE THEY WERE RESPONSIBLE, then softened it by mentioning China, other countries, &quot;everybody hacks us&quot; sort of thing. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The Russian election interference plot is total bullshit.  Did Putin dislike HRC sure, but in all honesty being that Clinton promised to be Obama 2.0 and he only gained power while Obizzy was at the helm he probably couldn&#39;t give a damn.   The only reason I could come up with regarding a preference for Trump would come directly from the debates.  HRC indicated a desire to enforce a no fly zone in Syria that could have led to a actual war between us and them.  He wouldn&#39;t want this just as any other sane person we are talking about a WW3 scenario.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>HHHHmmmmmmm.....maybe I just imagined that Putin became Premiere of Russia in 1999. Later that same year, when the alcoholic Yeltsin resigned (likely forced to by Putin with charges of corruption), Putin became President. He was President of Russia from 2000 until 2008 (two terms). The Russian Constitution limits Presidents to eight years at a time in office. So, Putin stepped down and placed his &quot;Sock Puppet&quot; Medvedev in office. The entire time Medvedev was in office, Putin was pulling his strings in his old office of Premier (2008-2012). As soon as he was legally able to, Putin took back the office of President, where he sits today (2012-present). Putin is not just a thug. He is HIGHLY INTELLIGENT. He is an attorney, and he wrote two scholarly papers: &quot;The Most Favored Nation Trading Principle in International Law&quot; and &quot;The Strategic Planning of Regional Resources Under the Formation of Market Relations&quot;.</p>

<p>Putin didn&#39;t dislike HRC at all. At least, not until he found out that HRC/Obama were funding ISIL to try and overthrow Russia&#39;s Good Friend and best Ally in the middle east...ASSAD.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Kind of a decent reason to dislike them.  Putin saw an important base for him being compromised.  Lybia had already descended into A jihadist playground, and our government was looking to make Syria the same.  Honestly our involvement in Syria has massacred a host of different groups within the country.  The arming of salafist groups has not worked out and is a disgrace.  It is unbelievable that Obama had a Muslim CIA director who furthered Islamic interests worldwide, but was never confronted about it by the press.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Firstly you quote &quot;HACKING THE US ELECTIONS&quot; as if Obama said that. Officially the reasons that the sanctions were put in place was because this actual quote: &quot;Russia&#39;s cyberactivities were intended to influence the election, erode faith in US democratic institutions, sow doubt about the integrity of our electoral process, and undermine confidence in the institutions of the US government,&quot; a White House statement said. &quot;These actions are unacceptable and will not be tolerated.&quot;</p>

<p>Intelligence agencies have confirmed that Russia tried to influence our elections with cyber programs  aimed at spreading fake news. Fake news which T_D eats up on a regular basis and proves their point. Nothing was said about &quot;HACKING THE US ELECTIONS&quot; because nothing was proved. But Russians actively trying to support Trump and hurt Hilary, that has been proved. </p>

<p>On top of that, the sanctions are justified even without Russian interference in our elections due to their actions in the Ukrainian Crisis. Of which the EU and Australia have sanctioned them.</p>

<p>Flynn has known Russian ties. Allegedly and now being looked at seriously by all intelligence agencies, Trump and team were offered 19.5% stake in Russian owned oil company in exchange for lifting sanctions. Flynn discussed lifting of sanctions. Then lied about it. He resigned to damage control the possibility of a treason charge, of which it might still come. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh right: U.S. intelligence officials have concluded that hackers working for Russia hacked into the Democratic National Committee&#39;s computer network, as well as the private email of John Podesta, a top adviser to Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton.</p>

<p>Oh and still Obama did not say hacking explicitly:
President Obama says the United States will respond to Russian cyberattacks that the intelligence community has concluded were part of an effort to influence the 2016 presidential election.</p>

<p>In an interview with NPR&#39;s Steve Inskeep that is airing Friday on Morning Edition, Obama said, &quot;I think there is no doubt that when any foreign government tries to impact the integrity of our elections ... we need to take action. And we will — at a time and place of our own choosing. Some of it may be explicit and publicized; some of it may not be.&quot;</p>

<p><a href="http://www.hasjamesclapperbeenindictedyet.com/">http://www.hasjamesclapperbeenindictedyet.com/</a></p>

<p>Yeah, remember the guy that said UNDER OATH:</p>

<p>On March 12th, 2013, during a United States Senate Select Committee on Intelligence hearing, Senator Ron Wyden asked Director of National Intelligence James R. Clapper the following question:</p>

<p>&quot;Does the NSA collect any type of data at all on millions or hundreds of millions of Americans?&quot;</p>

<p>Director Clapper responded &quot;No, sir.&quot;</p>

<p>Incredulously, Senator Wyden asked &quot;It does not?&quot;</p>

<p>Director Clapper responded &quot;Not wittingly. There are cases where they could inadvertantly perhaps collect, but not wittingly.&quot;</p>

<p>Is that the guy you want us to take his word over Wikileaks and Assange, who have NEVER been proven to have lied about anything. </p>

<p>Like I said, keep trying. You may earn your pay eventually.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have never made any claims that I am/was unbiased. Those are your assumptions. Anybody wishing to peruse my previous posts is welcome to do so. I use the term snowflakes, precisely because it is true and a perfect descriptor. I despise snowflakes and political correctness. I have said for many years, that NO POLITICIAN has any of your interests in mind. NONE of them give a flying shit whether any of you can pay your bills and put gas in your cars or not! When the election was over, we went back to our lives, and Clinton and Trump went back to their billionaire buddies and country clubs. I don&#39;t know any of your ages, but I have watched the Clintons since the early 1980s. HRC (and BILL) are degenerate criminals. Trump is a non-politically correct billionaire fratboy. </p>

<p>The only downvote that is accurate was Eric Carver&#39;s. I don&#39;t believe this is any kind of a conspiracy (unless you want to call Trump letting Flynn take all the blame a conspiracy). </p>

<p>The evidence has been clear since the Wikileaks Releases that show all the complicity between HRC, MSM, and the DNC during the primaries and the election itself. Anyone who denies it, is a shill, naive, or stupid.</p>

<p>.........and its not just the DNC. THE RNC IS JUST AS FUCKED UP! Remember when Ted Cruz approached the DNC/HRC for money to fight Trump? HAHAHA </p>

<p>See, by hating on me for using WORDS that accurately describe you, you are proving my point precisely! Instead of looking inside yourselves and seeing your Party Establishment for what it is, you attack someone for calling you out on it. <strong>&quot;If I see my party for what it is, then I might have to admit my faith was wrongly placed!&quot;</strong> </p>

<p>So, argue against this:</p>

<p>In 2008, when Obama stole the DNC Primary from HRC, who was Clinton&#39;s campaign co-chairperson? Debbie Wasserman-Schultz. Who was the DNC Chair from 2009-2011? Tim Kaine. Kaine wasn&#39;t voted out of office. He resigned, and HE NAMED Debbie Wasserman Schultz as his replacement. Why would he do that? Schultz was just a nobody co-chair of a campaign! Simple, put Schultz in a position to coordinate the DNC to fuck over everybody except HRC. Why would Kaine do that? Maybe his payback came from HRC&#39;s CERTAIN Presidential bid in 2016?</p>

<p>So, if you snowflakes can&#39;t see the simple truths of your own party, then you don&#39;t belong in modern society. Same thing for republican snowflakes. See you pack of idiots, SNOWFLAKES are from all parties and all walks of life. All races and religions. All sexual orientations. If you are defensive about being called one, then that says more about you than me?</p>

<p>aaaaaawwwwwwwwww, you mad bruhs?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks for this comment. It&#39;s important to remember both republicans and democrats are corrupt and stuck neck high in the vile putrid cesspool that we call Washington DC. Time to clean house. This is why Trump who isn&#39;t really a republican won. People were sick of the establishment after 8 years of Obama and what do the democrats do? Run the most establishment candidate ever in history against the outsider. I certainly wasn&#39;t surprised he won. People wanted change and with Hillary it would have been a whole lot of the same old shit.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks. Anyone that has read more than three or four of my posts, should be able to figure me out pretty easily. I have never worn two faces, and I have never tried to hide who I am. I love my country more than I love myself. I have zero tolerance for stupidity or bullshit. I have no political allegiances, and most importantly, I could give a shit who you vote for, who (or what) you like to fuck, what you choose to do to YOUR body, what sex you are, what color you are, or to whom you pray.</p>

<p>I have a problem with anybody who has a problem with me. I treat others according to how they treat me...........and I am also man enough to admit when I fuck up. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t think there was anything noble about this, it is really very simple. I think it was too much bad press and complication at a time Trump doesn&#39;t have the time or political equity to spend on him, so he was told he could resign or be fired. </p>

<p>This was a tactical business decision.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ummmmm, I don&#39;t recall ever using the word NOBLE? Maybe I missed when I typed that? </p>

<p>See, I don&#39;t ascribe motivation to a person or event, unless it is blatantly obvious or overtly stated. Flynn may never say out loud that Trump knew all along. It may be absolutely true that Flynn did this on his own, and Trump knew nothing about it. I doubt the last though. Anybody that knows anything about Narcissism, knows that Trump wouldn&#39;t let anybody under him do something that big without asking him first.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>HHHHmmmmmmm.....maybe I just imagined that Putin became Premiere of Russia in 1999. Later that same year, when the alcoholic Yeltsin resigned (likely forced to by Putin with charges of corruption), Putin became President. He was President of Russia from 2000 until 2008 (two terms). The Russian Constitution limits Presidents to eight years at a time in office. So, Putin stepped down and placed his &quot;Sock Puppet&quot; Medvedev in office. The entire time Medvedev was in office, Putin was pulling his strings in his old office of Premier (2008-2012). As soon as he was legally able to, Putin took back the office of President, where he sits today (2012-present). Putin is not just a thug. He is HIGHLY INTELLIGENT. He is an attorney, and he wrote two scholarly papers: &quot;The Most Favored Nation Trading Principle in International Law&quot; and &quot;The Strategic Planning of Regional Resources Under the Formation of Market Relations&quot;.</p>

<p>Putin didn&#39;t dislike HRC at all. At least, not until he found out that HRC/Obama were funding ISIL to try and overthrow Russia&#39;s Good Friend and best Ally in the middle east...ASSAD.</p>
