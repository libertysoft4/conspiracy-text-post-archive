        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>So there&#39;s been a huge amount of pedo takedowns lately. Looks like we now know exactly why and it has apparently nothing to do with Trump or Pizzagate. Here are some facts:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Ashton Kutcher&#39;s organization THORN, founded in 2009, have identified 2000 child victims in the past 6 MONTHS.</p></li>
<li><p>THORN developed a program called Spotlight (now in Beta) for tracking down pedos. This program is in the hands of 4000 law enforcement officials, 900 law enforcement agencies, and is used in ALL 50 states. </p></li>
<li><p>THORN&#39;s spotlight reduces investigation time by 60% for law enforcement. Can reduce investigation time form 3 years to 3 weeks!</p></li>
<li><p>Kutcher testified in front of Senate to ask for funding in fighting human trafficking through its programs. THORN is currently not being funded by the government. </p></li>

    <div class="md"><p>My guess is that it&#39;s more of a combination of the two (Pizzagate and Kutcher), rather than one thing being the source of it, but I&#39;d bet THORN is a huge contributing factor for the takedowns. Good on him for doing something about it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>A combination? What takedowns has PG been directly responsible for? All I see are video analysis of some weird video on worldcorp. All while real law enforcement individuals and real activists that spend their time and money on the issue like Kutcher are doing the actual work. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I meant that more as the growing awareness of Pizzagate. Not direct responsibility. People are paying more attention to the pedophilia problem in our country which attracts more attention to organizations like THORN, which further encourages people to donate, help out, and do what they can, ultimately aiding THORN in their mission and what they&#39;re capable of doing. THORN is the core of it, but the awareness of PG could be a factor in more and more of what&#39;s happening. Just my guess.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s a good guess. But one thing to remember is that Thorn has been around since 2009, collecting information on human trafficking and developing software to combat it. This all happened before Pizza Gate. And I doibt PG proponents have even heard of Thorn until Kutcher just this last week went before Senate to talk about it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Without acknowledgement from the enforcement agencies involved, this is complete speculation that could be considered dangerous considering they are a front that takes money. I&#39;d be more interested in seeing some hard data or hearing an enforcement agency commend them for their help and service. Otherwise you could just be trying to draw a false correlation to help an ineffective charity... </p>

<p>i think the hundreds if not thousands of people working on this stuff are the biggest catalyst. Kutcher has been doing this for years, but only after PG hit did we see an acceleration in arrests. I think it has more to do with the internet than Kutcher, PG, or anything else. The internet is bringing people&#39;s intelligence together, and they&#39;re starting to get &#39;professional&#39; level results.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You want acknowledgement from law enforcement officials to prove that THORN is working? The fact that Kutcher testified in front of senate that 4000 law enforcement officials and 900 law enforcement agencies use it isn&#39;t enough proof for you? Okay here&#39;s more, current law enforcement users of Spolight were surveyed as to the effectiveness of Spotlight, in the last 12 months they said 1980 children id&#39;d and 2186 traffickers were identified. 
Source: <a href="https://www.wearethorn.org/spotlight/">https://www.wearethorn.org/spotlight/</a></p>

<p>Spotlight (still in beta) only this year has been in widespread use by law enforcement officials. This explains why the impact is NOW happening and not before. Before that, research and development into the problem was the main thing THORN was doing. PG hasn&#39;t actually identified anyone and lead to arrests to my knowledge(please show me one example). On the otherhand Spotlight and law enforcement have helped 2000 children in the past 12 months!</p>

<p>This is a REAL tool against REAL trafficking and you are trying to downplay it so that PG can continue its internet sleauthing and acting as if its actually making an impact. It&#39;s pretty irresponsible of you. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Again, all hearsay and theory. Testifying to the Senate doesn&#39;t prove shit. As I said, if THORN was a key part of an arrest, I&#39;d assume enforcement would thank them and ask the public to give more resources. I haven&#39;t seen anything like that. Sorry.</p>

Law enforcement with the help of cutting edge software designed to catch Pedos developed over 3 years of research into the problem is ALOT more effective than watching a worldcorp video over and over until it sounds like Podesta. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not totally dismissing THORN. It could well be as effective as you claim it to be. However, for you to absolutely claim that it was THORN that led to all those arrests and for you minimize the work of people who are digging to find connections is wrong. You can&#39;t say that these people haven&#39;t made a difference - if anything, all of these sources work in concert. That&#39;s what i&#39;m responding to - your diminishing of other sources of effort. Also, hard facts go a long way. Acknowledgement is kind of a huge thing. You see - you can just make things up on the internet. Half-truths that sound real are the best ones. I try to look out for those. I think it&#39;s better to give everyone credit.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, THORN has been around for 8 years, the busts started up with increased intensity since November. Their have been more arrested in the last two months that 2014&amp;2015 combined.

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks, that fits more what what I have witnessed and tracked as well. THORN seems scary to me because of the circles it is plugged into and the fact that they were put in front of congress does not stand out as a plus for me right now. If there were open calls for pedophiles in government right now, I&#39;d be more willing to believe it, but the fact that it&#39;s still tooth-and-nail to me means that there is a chance that THORN is controlled opposition. Hopefully not tho.</p>

<p>Compare that to PG has not identified child victims and has not identified any traffickers. Also Trump hasn&#39;t done ANYTHING policy wise to lead anyone with rational thought to think he could have anything to do with it. Finally got the green light from Trump. WTF?  You think law enforcement needs a green light from the President to go after people breaking the law? How exactly do you think the Presidency works. Jesus Christ. </p>

Is endorsed by law enforcement officials in all 50 states and has been commended by Senate for its work. </p>

<p>What credit does PG deserve? How many pedos have they caught directly? How many child victims have they identified? ZERO. So why should we act like PG deserves equal credit to law enforcement and THORN. </p>

<p>It PG advocates actually cared about the problem they would stop wasting their time chasing ridiculous leads and just donate to Thorn. An actual organization with a actual research and development into how to tackle this problem realistically.  </p>

<p>It&#39;s great that kids are being rescued. This does not mean that Pizzagate is rendered moot. If anything, this group (led by Kutcher, a Clinton stool pigeon btw) could be knocking off the small fish or the competition. Making us feel all warm and fuzzy while not affecting the major players. Akin to how the DEA serves to destroy the CIAs competitors in the drug trade.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeh I did. By design I posted that 3 times. Yes it is great that children are being rescued, and they are being rescued by effective and well-thought out strategies instituted by THORN. And THORN should be commended and supported for their work so they can continue stopping traffickers. Yet all I see in this thread and including you are people who want to attack THORN&#39;s credibility based on ZERO EVIDENCE. You say it yourself, you accuse THORN founder Kutcher as being a Clinton stool pigeon (where you got this idea I don&#39;t know, because you probably don&#39;t have evidence of this). It&#39;s the baseless attacking of organizations like THORN that will do more harm than PizzaGate will ever do good for children. You act as if PizzaGate is some sort of awesome grass roots movement to catch pedos. While I&#39;m sure PG people are well-meaning, you can also see that they have a political narrative where they already believe the things they have no evidence of. And could possibly lead to innocent people being hurt for no reason. And let&#39;s not act as if PG has been effective, they have caught ZERO pedos in all their months of investigations. </p>

<p>It gives the impression that PG advocates don&#39;t actually care about pedo arrests.

<p>Exactly. Global pedophile rings exist, and Podesta/Clinton may well be involved, but I&#39;ve always considered Pgate to be the controllable distraction. The narrative is too easy to manipulate with disinfo/misinfo, and I feel that it has been from early on. The narrative has been designed to make its proponents look and sound ridiculous, regardless of whether or not there is any truth in their claims.</p>

<p>Kudos to THORN, and Ashton Kutcher, for putting the resources together to be able to do something about it, while respecting what good there is left in our justice system and allowing the proper officials to handle it through legitimate legal channels.</p>
