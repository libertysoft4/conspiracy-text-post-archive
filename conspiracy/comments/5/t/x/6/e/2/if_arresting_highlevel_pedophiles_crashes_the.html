    <div class="md"><p>As the OG FBIAnon said, this shit is spread like a spiderweb through government and it&#39;s connected to every major lever of power. If they yank it all at once, all the levers go off and we&#39;re &quot;justice bombed&quot; back to the Dark Ages. The assumption was that they are seeking out the right segment of the operation to destroy that will have the maximum effect of stopping this sort of shit from going on while minimizing the damage to the nation. </p>

<p>I&#39;m honestly pretty skeptical it&#39;s even possible. </p>

<p>If even the most vanilla version of the theory about what&#39;s going on is true, we&#39;re still dealing with a hundred+ year old cabal that has managed to consolidate power, take over our financial institutions, the justice department, police departments, FBI, CIA, major corporations, industrial fixtures, the pharmaceutical industry, and so much more. They&#39;re using blackmail to keep their cabal insulated, sure, but that&#39;s only their internal defense mechanism... the strategy they use to shut people on the inside up. Their actual defenses are far far more robust than could be defeated by jailing 2, 3, 10, 20 or even 100 pedophiles... it&#39;s a Jack the Ripper machine and it&#39;s pervasive through the system with members at every critical point and a &quot;by any means necessary&quot; level of commitment to their greater cause. </p>

<p>Now, the problem is that we still have no seen any legit hard evidence or ANY modern whistleblowers. Why? Are the PTB really that powerful at stopping leaks across this vast network? Or is the foundational theory about what is going on wrong? How, in fact, do you compel thousands of Satanists (who profess to place their own will above all others) to stay in line for so long? </p>

<p>Something just isn&#39;t quite adding up here. </p>

<p>These are actual questions - I don&#39;t have the answers to them and they aren&#39;t rhetorical. </p>

<p>Now to be clear, I am NOT suggesting that this stuff isn&#39;t happening. I believe that it is... I&#39;ve seen the documentaries and all sorts of other evidence to convince me that this has happened in the past, in other countries, and in fact in our own country... but the effectiveness at which this coverup is working is baffling to me. Even the mafia had leaks and rats. Either every single member of this cabal is terrified beyond comprehension, or some other mechanism is at work here... such as that this isn&#39;t one massive organization that we are looking at, but rather a loosely organized cell structure with anonymity built into every level. (That&#39;s my own personal opinion) this would allow the flexibility and secrecy needed for such an operation to exist without any single person being fully aware of what is <em>actually</em> going on outside of their own cell. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was wondering how they would crash it - I&#39;m sure that there are plenty of ways that people that are filthy rich (billionaires /trillionaires(?)) could forcibly crash the economy - but this is definitely another option.</p>

<p>By the way - you should watch george webbs investigation - the market wouldnt crash because these people are simply pedophiles - the market would crash because it would be uncovered that major fortune 500 companies&#39; upper tier personnel are funding and participating in the illicit trade of organs/humans and drugs.  There are probably money laundering operations going on in the form of foundation or campaign donations in order to lay out the infrastructure to systematically make these trades possible.  I&#39;m sure the people involved would have taken part in the sexual services thing, but that is actually such a small piece of this whole thing - that is now the equivalent of trying to bust hillary for sending a &#39;classified&#39; email on her private server; absolutely dwarfed in comparison to the overall operation</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not every single one is a pedophile, let&#39;s not jump to conclusions here. It definitly happens (at <em>every</em> level), but that is not the ONLY problem. Instead of plainly focusing on pedophilia, let&#39;s also focus on the enslavement of the citizens and our lack of freedom and WHAT WE CAN DO ABOUT IT. People have always expected someone else will do it, and look where <em>that</em> has gotten us! Nowhere. It&#39;s time to take action, people.

    <div class="md"><p>I never said everyone in wallst, only the most influential, so let&#39;s not jump to conclusions here.  Also, I use the term &#39;pedo&#39; to include all sorts of crimes, not just CP or pizza but also child sex trafficking and police gangrape in sex sting operations.</p>

<p>The fundamental problem is these people have too much money.  This means they get tired of even fortune 500 prostitutes shipped in from around the world.  They then move on to more and more taboo areas of human pleasure, because doing so reinforces to themselves this innate need to cast themselves in a different category from other humans.  That&#39;s why they are behind merging with robots and such also.  They think humanity is ugly and gross and they want to be sterile, plastic fasttwitch people that are living artforms of six-sigma perfection without the messiness of human emotion--this is the thinking behind their eugenicist ideology as well.  So with this in mind, they have no problem seeing people as meat or as sex robot dolls to be used for their pleasure, after all, they&#39;ve worked hard to deserve to engage in taboos disalowed to the underclass. Privilege in this way makes them special; makes them better than you.  They worship the double standard.  They think the ends justify the means and therefore whatever they can conceive and believe they can achieve if they deceive in order to receive a reprieve.  And that&#39;s nasty.</p>

<p>SO my point is they do these pedo things to feel special about themselves because they fundamentally are so hollow inside they have to have perversion and  money to fill it up.  I feel sorry for those stuck in the psychopathic control grid matrix called the  upper class.  They have no legitimate authentic joy, they&#39;re stuck in their own mirror on the wall and trapped in their phantom zone</p>

<p>Not just by their own pathetic defects of empathy but by the law as well. Because it turns out, there are subverts in our government who know how to exploit this unique form of childrape-based narcissism: by blackmail.  They use &#39;brownstone operations&#39; or rather &#39;sex stings&#39; using low light hidden cameras and operatives to entrap these people into the same.  They lure these people--sometimes over years time--into increasing levels of perversion into having sex with a kid.  Then they show these people the tape, the photos and they are controllable then.  It&#39;s the same thing Saul Bernstain in Homeland does, use sex stings to control Turkish or Iranian diplomats.  </p>

<p>Now this is saying nothing about other forms of childrape-based classism in secret societies such as freemasonry, but I&#39;ll save that for another day.</p>

<p>Rise of the National Security State
The CIA’s links to Wall Street
By Mark Gaffney
February 21, 2012 &quot;Information Clearing House&quot; --- One of the most successful frauds ever perpetrated upon the American people is the notion that the CIA exists to provide intelligence to the president. In fact, the CIA’s intimate links to Wall Street strongly suggest that the CIA was created to serve the perceived interests of investment bankers. The well documented links to Wall Street can be traced to the founding of the agency.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;I spent 33 years and four months in active military service and during that period I spent most of my time as a high class muscle man for Big Business, for Wall Street and the bankers. In short, I was a racketeer, a gangster for capitalism. I helped make Mexico and especially Tampico safe for American oil interests in 1914. I helped make Haiti and Cuba a decent place for the National City Bank boys to collect revenues in. I helped in the raping of half a dozen Central American republics for the benefit of Wall Street. I helped purify Nicaragua for the International Banking House of Brown Brothers in 1902-1912. I brought light to the Dominican Republic for the American sugar interests in 1916. I helped make Honduras right for the American fruit companies in 1903. In China in 1927 I helped see to it that Standard Oil went on its way unmolested. Looking back on it, I might have given Al Capone a few hints. The best he could do was to operate his racket in three districts. I operated on three continents.”</p>

<p>What? How is this &quot;Republican propaganda&quot; and why are you turning it into a partisan issue? Both sides are involved with pedophile crimes against children, and other global elites. Remember the Whitehouse Callboy ring during HW Bush, etc.? Have you heard of the Discovery Chanel documentary that was canceled from being air and leaked by a former Nebraska senator called Conspiracy of Silence, or the book called The Franklin Coverup, or that 60 Minites Australia episode on UK government pedophilia, or that documentary called An Open Secret on pedophillia in Hollywood, or the movie Eyes Wide Shut, or the recent movie on pedophile preists called Spotligh, or the convicted pedophile billionaire with his pedo Lolita Express plane and pedo island where he hosts orgies and has hidden cameras in rooms for blackmail, or the many people coming forward claiming to be raped by politicians and other global elites, or Jimmy Savile, etc, etc, etc.</p>

<p>There are many pedo rings that get busted all the time. There are also rings protected by police forces and government agencies that also have connections with global elites.</p>

<p>There is the work of a fellow redditor (Post regarding: In light of the recent Pizzagate revelations, let us all remember one of the best posts of all time in <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>; &quot;[ORIGINAL RESEARCH] The Mountain of Evidence for a Massive International Pedophile Ring Protected by Police and Intelligence Agencies&quot; by <a href="/u/LawOfAttraction33">/u/LawOfAttraction33</a> (<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/5hq1j3/in_light_of_the_recent_pizzagate_revelations_let">https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/5hq1j3/in_light_of_the_recent_pizzagate_revelations_let</a> )) that used to go by <a href="/u/LawOfAttraction33">/u/LawOfAttraction33</a>, and now, <a href="/u/Love_And_Light33">/u/Love_And_Light33</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>I never said everyone in wallst, only the most influential, so let&#39;s not jump to conclusions here.  Also, I use the term &#39;pedo&#39; to include all sorts of crimes, not just CP or pizza but also child sex trafficking and police gangrape in sex sting operations.</p>

<p>The fundamental problem is these people have too much money.  This means they get tired of even fortune 500 prostitutes shipped in from around the world.  They then move on to more and more taboo areas of human pleasure, because doing so reinforces to themselves this innate need to cast themselves in a different category from other humans.  That&#39;s why they are behind merging with robots and such also.  They think humanity is ugly and gross and they want to be sterile, plastic fasttwitch people that are living artforms of six-sigma perfection without the messiness of human emotion--this is the thinking behind their eugenicist ideology as well.  So with this in mind, they have no problem seeing people as meat or as sex robot dolls to be used for their pleasure, after all, they&#39;ve worked hard to deserve to engage in taboos disalowed to the underclass. Privilege in this way makes them special; makes them better than you.  They worship the double standard.  They think the ends justify the means and therefore whatever they can conceive and believe they can achieve if they deceive in order to receive a reprieve.  And that&#39;s nasty.</p>

<p>SO my point is they do these pedo things to feel special about themselves because they fundamentally are so hollow inside they have to have perversion and  money to fill it up.  I feel sorry for those stuck in the psychopathic control grid matrix called the  upper class.  They have no legitimate authentic joy, they&#39;re stuck in their own mirror on the wall and trapped in their phantom zone</p>

<p>Not just by their own pathetic defects of empathy but by the law as well. Because it turns out, there are subverts in our government who know how to exploit this unique form of childrape-based narcissism: by blackmail.  They use &#39;brownstone operations&#39; or rather &#39;sex stings&#39; using low light hidden cameras and operatives to entrap these people into the same.  They lure these people--sometimes over years time--into increasing levels of perversion into having sex with a kid.  Then they show these people the tape, the photos and they are controllable then.  It&#39;s the same thing Saul Bernstain in Homeland does, use sex stings to control Turkish or Iranian diplomats.  </p>

<p>Now this is saying nothing about other forms of childrape-based classism in secret societies such as freemasonry, but I&#39;ll save that for another day.</p>
