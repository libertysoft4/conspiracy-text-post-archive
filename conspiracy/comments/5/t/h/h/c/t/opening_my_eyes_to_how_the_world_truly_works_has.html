    <div class="md"><p>A couple of days ago i read this giant thing <a href="https://veilofreality.com/2011/04/18/organic-portals-soulless-humans/">https://veilofreality.com/2011/04/18/organic-portals-soulless-humans/</a>
It basically goes into detail about what you are saying. Apparently about 50% of the population are incapable of activating their higher chakras, and they are basically just robots. They are 3D service to self beings. The other half with a soul are the same but have the potential to connect to their higher selves. A long time ago the beings with souls have fallen from the &quot;4D service to others&quot; state of being and memories still remain within them and this is why some people have the existential internal conflict. The soulless beings do not have that internal conflict, their only inner conflict is related to needs like food and water, and sexual impulse. The soulless and souled beings have been interbreeding for so long that they could be both within the same family.</p>

<p>There&#39;s a lot more detail in that article so if you&#39;re curious or skeptical I would check that out, I&#39;m not saying its true but it&#39;s very interesting.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was just about to type &quot;We&#39;ve all been there.&quot; </p>

<p>You gotta remember--all these people have been getting programmed literally since the day they were born. Some of them probably aren&#39;t very bright to begin with. Others have been brainwashed into believing that material goods will bring them happiness. </p>

<p>Some people can break past it, but it isn&#39;t easy and it usually requires some level of pain, and the brain is trained to avoid pain.  </p>

<p>The best way to take these people is with bemused detached fondness for whatever their better points may be, and everyone has them. I have friends who I can&#39;t really discuss anything but baseball with, but the baseball conversations are pretty good, LOL.</p>

<p>Good luck to you!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I understand your frustration.  I try to focus on what I can do to help.  Hatred slows down advancement and at best is a low vibrational motivational force.  Most people need to learn for themselves in order to be convinced.  People don&#39;t want to be told what to believe and some will even just try to play devil&#39;s advocate.  I try to steer people in the right direction depending on the person.  :)  I think certain people are better off not knowing the truth.</p>

<p>Have a nice day everyone.  :)</p>
