        <h3 class="title">The Longitudinal Coordinates Of The Great Pyramid Match The First Few Digits Of The Speed Of Light. My Theory: Not A Coincidence, Big Implications, The Pyramid Builders Aren't Responsible</h3>
        <p><span class="badge badge-primary">68</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;2017-02-13 by <a class="author" href="../../../../../../../../user/benedictFocker.html">benedictFocker</a></p>
        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>The people who set the British meridian <em>are</em> responsible.</p>

<p>The coordinates of the longitudinal location of the pyramid are: 29.9792 E, and the speed of light is: 299,792,XXX meters per second.</p>

<p>Some people claim that the Egyptians could have known about the meter and so forth.  I think while that&#39;s possible, including the possibility that they could have known of the speed of light, what&#39;s more likely is that the people who chose the prime meridian knew of the speed of light.</p>

<p>The first &quot;setting&quot; of the meridian was in 1721 because that&#39;s where the British royal observatory was.  Okay, we all know England had its share of alchemists and astrologers.  You&#39;re telling me the guys running the Royal observatory wouldn&#39;t know exactly where Giza is?</p>

<p>So there are two implications of this:
First- the meter that was introduced during the French Revolution would have already been known to alchemist/Rosicrucians for at least 100 years.  That makes sense.  The British astronomers would have most likely been a branch of French Rosicrucians from a couple centuries prior - who themselves established a meridian or &quot;rose line&quot; through Paris.  This was the basis for the meter eventually.  It&#39;s very likely that the French Revolution was undertaken with the intent of bringing things like the meter into public use.  I doubt the rationalist Rosicrucian/mason/illuminati types waited until they had power to suddenly wonder about more rational units of measure.</p>

<p>That&#39;s very believable and consistent with the history of who was involved in that era of science.  </p>

<p>What&#39;s more remarkable is that they could have known the speed of light by 1720.  Officially, it was calculated by around 1950.</p>

<p>So it&#39;s very believable that when choosing the location of the royal observatory that they would look for significant metrics.  The location of Giza, the meter as 1/100,000 of the earth&#39;s half circumference, that would all be known very well to astute astronomers of the day (not the meter per se, but they&#39;d have had the skills to easily calculate it and it&#39;s not exactly random).  Also, they&#39;d have cared about weird things like coordinates of mythical structures and whatever.</p>

<p>The fact London is remotely positioned so that this coincidence is possible is sort of a coincidence.  And I suppose Greenwhich is near the London docks, and the observatory&#39;s purpose would be to deal with navigation science which is a boat thing - well it explains why the observatory wasn&#39;t built on the other side of London.  So a couple of coincidences.</p>

<p>But there&#39;s at least plausibility here.  The only weird part is: could they have calculated the speed of light back then?</p>

<p>Assuming this would have been logistically possible (i.e.: they might have had the know how but wouldn&#39;t have had like modern materials like vast quantities of radioactive minerals), it implies that there are secret scientific societies that trickle out knowledge in a manner that allows them to control society.</p>

<p>This theme is present in games like Wolfenstein the new order, but also in movies such as Tomorrowland.  It&#39;s also a common conspiracy theory related to Antarctica disclosure theories.</p>

<p>David Seaman and Alex Jones have both been hyping a Trump technology disclosure and 100 year leap forward.</p>

<p>And there are news crews headed to Antarctica this week to cover &quot;climate change&quot;.</p>

<p>Wikileaks vault 7 should drop any day now.  And pizzagate is supposedly happening.</p>

<p>Good night!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There&#39;s an earlier one that was set by the French is France (of course).</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris_meridian">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris_meridian</a></p>

<p>This one was called the Rose Line as is well-known to those who read or watch The Da Vinci Code.</p>

<p>Another tidbit...</p>

<blockquote>
<p>A French astronomer, Abbé <strong>Jean Picard</strong>, measured the length of a degree of latitude and computed from it the size of the Earth during 1669–1670. In 1666, Louis XIV of France had authorized the building of an observatory in Paris to measure longitude. On Midsummer&#39;s Day 1667, members of the Academy of Sciences traced the future building&#39;s outline on a plot outside town near the Port Royal abbey, with Picard&#39;s meridian exactly bisecting the site north-south. French cartographers would use it as their prime meridian for more than 200 years.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I mentioned this.  The meter was based on some pretty simple astronomical geometric principles that would have been scientifically known in 1700.  And the French Revolution was almost certainly tied to Bavarian illuminati and Rosicrucian groups.  There&#39;s no reason to think the meter couldn&#39;t have been invented as he metric of science cults much earlier.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Correction, OP. It is the <strong>Latitudinal</strong> coordinates of Giza which match the speed of light in m/s. Giza is 29.979° above the Equator.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/3em6ts/til_the_speed_of_light_in_ms_is_the_exact_same/">https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/3em6ts/til_the_speed_of_light_in_ms_is_the_exact_same/</a></p>

<p>This relationship is unconnected to the Longitudinal Prime Meridian.</p>

<p>However, I have argued previously that there is also a separate relationship between Giza and our longitudinal system, and that Greenwich may have been chosen as the Prime meridian (influenced by freemasons) because of its spatial relationship to Giza. I discovered this myself using Google Earth: <strong>the Prime meridian is 299,557,000 cm West of Giza, which is only 0.07% different from the speed of light/100.</strong> Astonishingly close.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/3em6ts/til_the_speed_of_light_in_ms_is_the_exact_same/ctgm2ku/">https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/3em6ts/til_the_speed_of_light_in_ms_is_the_exact_same/ctgm2ku/</a></p>

<p>However, I also discovered another latitudinal/longitudinal relationship to Giza. Go to Google Earth and post in the 9 first digits of the Speed of Light in the latitude column and then type in the first 9 digits of Pi in the longitude column (31.4159265°).</p>

<p>You will find location marker is not far from the Great Pyramid, but if you measure it, this new grid coordinate is precisely 27,000 metres from the Great pyramid, at angle of 270°. Strange, no? </p>

<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/2i66ih/if_you_type_299792458n_into_google_maps_you_will/ckzfxy9/">https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/2i66ih/if_you_type_299792458n_into_google_maps_you_will/ckzfxy9/</a></p>

<p>When you also consider that the external dimensions (specifically the circumferential relationship of the corners to the sides) of the Great Pyramid itself contains the equation for the speed of light, one has to conclude that none of this is a coincidence - it is by design.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Okay, but why did those astronomers think that the pyramids in Giza had anything remotely to do with light? Why choose the meridian in such a way to give that very important number to &quot;tombs&quot;?</p>

<p>Rather, have you heard of genetically encoded knowledge? Basically, there was a study done where they bred a bunch of chickens for 10 generations, all in captivity, all indoors where the baby chicks could not encounter predators. They then would fly kites that looked like hawks over the chickens, and they wouldn&#39;t express fear. Then they had a live hawk fly over, and the chickens, without any prior encounters knew to fear the hawk. This has lead to the conclusion that some bits of knowledge can be passed on genetically. Its a stretch for sure, but what if humanity was once more advanced, and this information was passed on from our more advanced ancestors? Probably not, but something to think about. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The pyramids, and many other sacred sites on earth, are part of a grid that has to do with higher dimensional technology that we don&#39;t understand.</p>

<p>They were constructed by higher dimensional beings who are guiding the human race towards love, to help us survive the upcoming polar shift.</p>

<p>The grid is metaphysical, and it has recently been activated. It has increased our collective psychic capabilities and enabled us to build a lower technology grid within it (the internet) in order to clearly communicate as a species.</p>

<p>The internet makes available the spiritual and higher dimensional knowledge YOU will need to survive the upcoming consciousness shift.</p>

<p>Other people can give you the techniques and point you in the right direction, but ultimately YOU are connected to the universe and the answer is within YOU.</p>

<p>Find real meditations that have you chant the syllables for each chakra and learn to activate your Kundalini.</p>

<p>Learn to meditate and silence your consciousness for long periods of time. Dig deep into your Akashic knowledge buried deep in your DNA.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What makes more sense to me about the numeric synchronicities within the pyramids.  Is that its mathematically based or &quot;composed&quot; in a matter that can be checked (like all good math) through another measurement or equation within the pyramid complex that matches something else in the universe.  </p>

<p>So its not did they know about the meter because the term &quot;meter&quot; is a label that our evolution/generation of intelligence has created. What it does mean is that we&#39;ve reconnected with an intelligence thats existed before but previously lost to us, that can be checked through measurment within the pyramid complex.</p>

<p>Its a sign of a reconnection with lost intelligence and an indicator of a common manner of thinking in the creative process between us and the evolution that created the pyramids.</p>
