        <h3 class="title">r/worldnews, a default subreddit, is now censoring all news related to muslim refugees (unless it paints them as victims) after recently adding almost a dozen anti-trump/anti-conservative moderators</h3>
        <p><span class="badge badge-primary">510</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;2017-02-13 by <a class="author" href="../../../../../../../../user/Sara_Solo.html">Sara_Solo</a></p>
        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I&#39;ve been pretty controversial on r/worldnews over the past 5 years. I&#39;ve bashed israel over the 2014 gaza conflict, called out idf for their propaganda on the subreddit, and more recently defended assad and argued against an american government that clearly wanted to ruin that country long before the &quot;civil war&quot; broke out. </p>

<p>However, to my surprise, I never once had a comment deleted in all these years. Until today when I made the comment &quot;WTF i love hezbollah now...&quot;. As you can see in my user history the comment is right there at the top, and when you permalink it nothing comes up because it was deleted. This style of commenting was popularized on the trump subreddit and is a well known indicator of a trump supporter to people who obsess  over that stuff. Ironically, I am a Sanders supporter.</p>

<p>If you look at r/uncensorednews the big story all week has been unwarranted <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/uncensorednews/top/?sort=top&amp;t=week">censorship</a> in r/worldnews. The accusations largely stem from the systematic removal of any mention of refugees (but only if it paints the refugees negatively; if the refugees are being victimized the story is allowed to stay) including r/worldnews moderator replies indicating that the moderators have chosen to approve only one side of the discussion on the north african/middle eastern refugee crisis in europe and north america. </p>

<p>It was at this point--having my comment deleted for the first time--that I decided to look to see if there was any recent activity that may explain why this subreddit had clearly become openly biased in its moderation. Just a quick and random look at some of the moderators added recently shows them modding/commenting in subreddits like:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>White_Fragility</p></li>
<li><p>presidentbannon</p></li>
<li><p>the_donald_circlejerk</p></li>
<li><p>fuckthealtright</p></li>
<li><p>Alt_Right (a subreddit dedicated towards exposing trump&#39;s nazi past)</p></li>
</ul>

<p>And most have comments within the first page of their comment history of things like &quot;this is what it&#39;s like arguing with a trump supporter&quot; and wild conspiracy theories such as &#39;kkk supporters planning to prevent blacks from voting in the recent election.&#39;</p>

<p>My point is that this is a default subreddit, whose majority of moderators are openly biased against trump, and whose moderation proves that they are incapable of leaving out their political biases/ideology when moderating. The reddit admin argument is that people are allowed to create subreddits where they censor opinions they dislike, but my counterargument is that they shouldn&#39;t be allowed to be a default subreddit if they do that. It is pretty clear that after many years of being a neutral subreddit--at least when it came to censorship--r/worldnews has been compromised and become another r/politics.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I understand your point.  From what I understand, you believe that the moderator eliminating posts that do not subscribe to a particular worldview.  You believe that this is censorship.  I honestly do not know if your claims are accurate, so I will just assume that your beliefs are correct.</p>

<p>Personally, I don&#39;t know if you have much grounds on which to complain.  From what I understand, the subreddits do not have to be democratic.  The moderators have the power to decide what is and is not on topic.  Since the number of subreddits is limitless, denying you a platform on one subreddit does not deny you the ability to say what you would like.  No one is entitled to the platform of their choice nor is anyone required to take your message seriously.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Something interesting to note, after a quick search of my user history, it seems that r/worldnews has deleted all of my comments questioning validity of the &quot;13,000 hanged by assad&quot; that made headlines there <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/5si7zo/syria_conflict_thousands_hanged_at_saydnaya/ddffdu1/">last week</a>. Curious to hear what all of you think about the legitimacy of the story in the context of videos like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DfyZTM5OiUY">this</a></p>

<p>Notice how all of the comments on the r/worldnews are extremely emotional and basically jump the gun wherein they are incapable of questioning the legitimacy of the information that is being presented to them. All these &quot;holy shit this is awful, I&#39;m crying&quot; comments...well what if what you&#39;re crying over isn&#39;t even real. I get a similar vibe from this to the iraq warmongering days where we would see those 3d renderings of saddams chemical labs and all the sob stories. Remember how people felt about that without questioning? According to the video I linked amnesty international was behind the 3d renderings for both stories--assad and saddam.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>they ARE the victims in this crisis dummy, victims of the west, thats why they hate the west. simple math really.  </p>

<p>its funny most of the farm animals here keep mooing and hee hawwing about how to keep safe from the refugees that they helped to create, financed through their own sheepishness and subservience to their governments and owners, yet so few from these same <em>brave</em> minions complain about the random hypocritical wars against who? muslim nations. oh and btw the same <em>nations</em> the west created.  the very same nations and leaders of those nations the maniacal bomb and pedo-loving government, YOUR government, used to support, arm and eventually stab in the back just so they can have an excuse to destroy the lives of the poor suckers had to endure those shitstain leaders the u.s. imposed upon them.</p>

<p>the reason alot of these &quot;justice warriors&quot; as you call them are &quot;welcoming refugees in with &quot;open arms&quot; because they feel the guilt of blowing them up with &quot;military arms,&quot; not that they&#39;re not being used as useful idiots to counter the other useful idiots but at least their position is moral albeit more than a bit underinformed.  </p>

<p>you want them to stop acting like cavemen, stop &quot;bombing them into the stone age&quot; as you <em>advanced</em> tiny-dicked n6rph6ettes love to repeat to eachother.</p>

<p>oh and btw, you want to see primitive behavior, just wait for the bullshit dollar to collapse, for your institutions that bring you your food, water, electricity, etc. while your beloved occidentalists start stealing from, killing and raping eachother in the states.  you love to fancy yourselves as advanced, nah not really, retarded actually.  </p>

<p>oh wait, theres never any violence or injustice associated with the united states of angelica, or the west. we&#39;re sooo wonderful, no sins... our movies and tv shows prove that.</p>

<p>karma is a bitch, and she&#39;s on her period assholes.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It is hilarious when you see people talk logically and provoke a decent point of view that get downvoted to oblivion. That says it all. The most upvoted comments are filled with vitriolic hate and show the intellect of a 5yr old. Even when generating discussion that is neutral and promotes free thinking, it is often ridiculed and again heavily downvoted. The trick is make a decent comment that is true and honest and wear your downvotes with pride. I believe that we will look back at these days (soon I hope) as a case study in mass brain washing and hysteria all generated by the MSM and the echo chambers on social media. It&#39;s actually an interesting phenomenon and in time those heavily downvoted comments that I mentioned will be looked at with dismay. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Nope, improper application of my logic. I merely advocated &quot;digging deeper,&quot; especially on a subreddit like r/conspiracy - due to the fact that there are indeed a high concentration of (often newer) posters who have a fairly obvious agenda.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, I totally get why people like Trump, despite him being probably a massive nutter. People had enough of PC stuff, lies and calling bad things good and good things bad. There was nobody else but Trump. In desperation people take the next best thing. This should teach extreme lefties a lesson [listen to what the majority of people want, explain to them without lying, don&#39;t take the piss out of the people you are there to serve], but like usually they still haven&#39;t learned to listen. And that&#39;s is how people like Trump, Hitler and others come to power. Desperation.</p>

Trump should go down with the rest of them he&#39;s pretty shit and his views on veterans, handicapped and most people is disgusting. I&#39;m happy he got voted in because now there&#39;s a president without celebrities, media and the party 100% on his side like all the previous ones, the fire that people have wanted to hold under politicians feet should be raging under Trump instead of letting him do what he wants just because he won. Any politician should be treated the same but Obama got a pass because of all that stupid Hope crap.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>As much as we all love Reddit, it is not and never will be a bastion of free speech. In fact it’s more the opposite, it’s designed to be an echo chamber where users with similar beliefs can gather and share those beliefs, it’s very easy for those users to then silence or ignore dissenting opinions. </p>

<p>Personally I think it would be great to get unbiased info on Reddit, but I don’t think it has ever actually been that way, or ever will. </p>

<p>I think the only way to oppose this is to create your own subreddits in opposition to those you disagree with.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>holy war? Well I hope both sides lose then. Meh go shore up your soldiers are r/uncensorednews or 4chan I don&#39;t see the &quot;muslim&quot; part as much as a problem and the constant finger pointing just brings about the worst people. Screw the over zealous religious people of any culture, there&#39;s still backwoods people in north america and europe who have child brides and they are christian or catholic. Fuck their anti homosexual, anti abortion, anti contraception stance. Go help out a Jesus camp they&#39;re militarizing children if you care so much.</p>

<p>In my opinion this is more of a class war against us then a holy war. They get to bring in these refugees who they hope will keep voting them in, an excuse to throw more big charity events and drinking champagne behind their gated houses while lambasting the rest of us for not wanting to live among uneducated people and using our tax dollars to help them. They probably take a little bit of the refugee money as kickbacks because hey they are doing a good thing. It seems more to me like these pro refugee politicians are so disconnected from the rest of us they think we should be taking care of the rest of the world because its not like our middle and lower class already have problems. Making this a Muslim/brown person thing is just unnecessary and I don&#39;t see any angle why our own politicians would want us to be more Muslim. I see if more as letting in more refugees to just benefit their egos and pockets while eroding the lower and middle classes.</p>

<p>I&#39;m don&#39;t think Reddit should censor but there is a lot of pro Trump propaganda out there that advances a racist agenda. </p>

<p>Here&#39;s a good example of Anti Muslim and anti immigrant propaganda:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/5trbad/georgetown_islamic_studies_professor_slavery_ok/">https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/5trbad/georgetown_islamic_studies_professor_slavery_ok/</a></p>

<p>The anti Muslim propaganda is very effective at getting the U.S. to engage in perpetual war the last 20 years or so. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I always remembered it as a struggle where real users occasionally won--at least to the point where you could get both sides of a story if you stuck around long enough. I remember when the israeli brigading would get so bad, and then you&#39;d get a thread where all people would do is talk about how they were surprised the brigade hadn&#39;t gotten there yet and laugh how maybe they were sleeping. </p>

<p>But now that I know the moderators are intentionally pushing their sjw refugee nonsense it really suggests that there&#39;s no hope left. Because it&#39;s destined to become like bestof, pics, technology, science, news where the posts are specifically crafted to make a specific homogeneous political statement every time they hit r/all.</p>
