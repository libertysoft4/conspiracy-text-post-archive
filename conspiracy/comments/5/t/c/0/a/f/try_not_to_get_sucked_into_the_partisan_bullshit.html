        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>So its easy to get caught up in the partisan drama that is permeating all facets our lives. It seems almost everyone on reddit, and almost everyone in  my real life is angry at half the country. You&#39;re either angry at &#39;trumptards&#39; or you&#39;re angry at &#39;libtards&#39;. What a lot of people dont realize, and what a lot of us here tend to forget is that this fighting is all intentional and planned. They want us to be at each other throats. If we are at each others throats, then we aren&#39;t at <em>their</em> throat. The vast majority of &quot;normal&quot; people are not happy with the government, yet they take it out on individuals. IDK, none of this stuff is a new or novel idea to most of you and I don&#39;t really know where I&#39;m going with this. Just stay strong, never practice hate, even against those hating you. And remember, it&#39;s not D vs R, it&#39;s us vs them, the peasants vs the elite, the slaves vs the masters.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Definitely, the shills on this sub are actually using party politics to their advantage. </p>

<p>I believe their tactic is to &quot;republican-ize&quot; this subreddit, so that nobody on the left gives us a chance or subscribes and has a chance to be redpilled.</p>

<p>If they give the impression that we are a bunch of Trump loving, racist sexist hillbilly conservatives, and our platform consists of mainly republicans (which is not even close to being true, most people here reject the two party system because it&#39;s a scam), than they limit the audience we can reach. </p>

<p>SO many new people are visiting this sub, we are gaining popularity everyday, especially since the explosion of Pizzagate. </p>

<p>Don&#39;t let the CTR try and push away new readers, and don&#39;t allow them to give the impression that this sub is full of &quot;crazies&quot; and &quot;racists&quot;, this isn&#39;t a Trump echo chamber (unlike the shills will have you believe). The majority of users here share a healthy skepticism of ALL government and politicians. </p>

<p>Black, white, Asian, Latino, Christian, Muslim, Hindu, transgender, WHATEVER. We don&#39;t give a fuck at r/conspiracy ! You are all welcome here! We just seek the truth! </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve already encountered some. I told them I was a Trump supporter, but on this subreddit I don&#39;t talk about him (unless the subject calls for it). And even then, I keep it professional.</p>

<p>One kind of asked, &quot;So you aren&#39;t going to bash me?&quot;</p>

<p>I replied, &quot;No, this is not the the place to do that. This is a place to discuss conspiracies.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Excellent dude, you did a good job there and handled that perfectly. You probably brightened up that guys day. </p>

<p>It boils down to the fact that the REAL news and what is actually Happening in regard to global affairs is discussed in only one sub, and that&#39;s this place. This place isn&#39;t just a &quot;conspiracy&quot; gathering, it&#39;s a news source. </p>

Once you&#39;ve separated yourself from it you are able to see things from a perspective that allows you to see that both sides are right in some ways, both wrong in some ways, and both so nasty to each other that they actually convince themselves of the things they are each wrong about because they can&#39;t be associated with the other side.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>While I agree with a lot of leftist ideals, the problem is a bit deeper. Specifically in the American left, there were two major MAJOR infiltrations. The first was 2008 with Obamas Wallstreet/banker sell-outs and cabinet picks.</p>

<p>The second was 2014 Soros&#39;s social justice takeover.</p>

<p>Unfortunately while the right has corruption too, on the left those two examples are intolerably massive to me.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I never thought a republican would win again in my lifetime.  Hillary was that bad of a candidate.  Abortion is a dividing issue .  I cannot understand why pro-life people are willing to throw their vote away on issue, one that has already been decided.  It is not like the pro-choice are going to force them to have abortions.  I can u sees tans the fight, under the color of religious beliefs, to not pay for abortions through taxes.  That is a valid argument.  The rest is just crazy to me.  I am 100% pro-choice, but voted against globalism.  I figured having a country left at all was the most important thing this election.</p>

She utterly disintegrated as things progressed. I can&#39;t imagine how torn up she is Trump won. This is a woman who went from being unable to keep off my bones to sitting across the room ignoring me in 4 months over the time it took her to realize just how conservative I actually am (I&#39;m a RINO-tarian).</p>

It&#39;s pathetic. I can&#39;t tell what&#39;s worse, the sheeple or the do nothings but god damn it drives me batty.</p>

<p>My only respite is that I&#39;d like to believe I see through it. But anyways it&#39;s embarrassing to us all that this is the level we&#39;ve devolved to as a result of the last election. If dumbing down the masses last year was the PTB&#39;s goal, they sure won big this round.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have no respect for my sister.  She is the least informed person I know.  Watching her jump on the trump bashing Facebook bandwagon makes me physically sick.  Really.
