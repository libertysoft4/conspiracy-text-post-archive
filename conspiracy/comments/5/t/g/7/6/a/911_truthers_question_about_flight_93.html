    <div class="md"><p>I mean, it is entirely possible. </p>

<p>I at one point was so deep into the 9/11 truth thing (this was around 2005 or so) that it&#39;s all I could see. At some point it becomes nearly crippling, with the paranoia that comes with it, etc.</p>

<p>I decided at one point the following;</p>

<ul>
<li>The official story of 9/11 is bogus</li>
<li>I have no idea who the major players are or motivations</li>
<li>I will probably never know (though, with this latest Vault7 thing, who knows?) the truth of that day</li>
<li>I have to be okay with never knowing, and I need to get on with my life, if only for myself</li>
</ul>

<p>Again, it is entirely possible that you are correct. But know that theories about that day are a hydra; for every one that you think plausible, ten more open up. The noise to signal ratio increases nearly exponentially with the &quot;what ifs&quot;. Hammer down what you do know, and guard those axiomatic truths with your life. </p>

<p>My two pennies. Good luck.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ive wondered it a lot, that maybe the plane went down into the ground in PA out of script.  #7 is so much shorter though, so I wondered how easy it would have been to fly into it.</p>

<p>But I am with you OP, seems like it was the loose wire of the story.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Interesting idea but I doubt it. The whole point of terrorism is symbolism--the wtc represents global capitalism and the pentagon represents US military imperialism, both of which are things that real terrorists despise. If a plane had actually struck building 7 I think it would have made more people question the attack because Americans would have been like, what does building 7 represent? It wouldn&#39;t have fit in with the official narrative. Flight 93 was supposedly headed for the white house because as a target that would have made sense, but the planners of the attack didn&#39;t want to blow up their own home so they made sure to shoot the plane down and relied on just telling everyone that the White House was the target in order to get everyone worked up about it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Could be. There are a few loose ends that could be the result of busted plans, media miscues, etc.</p>

<p>There was also a car bomb at the State Dept building in DC -- mentioned <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D290n9pvUsE">once on ABC</a>, all over 2-way pagers (wikileaks), then never again. I kinda figured 93 was meant for that, but who knows.</p>
