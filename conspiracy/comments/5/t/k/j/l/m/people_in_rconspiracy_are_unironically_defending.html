    <div class="md"><p>Sigh....Can we all keep in mind that the length of a person&#39;s account doesn&#39;t always signify that they are a shill or ctr or spawn of some entity??<br/>
I&#39;m a forty-five year old single mother of three who avoided tech and tech-related sites/gadgets for decades because frankly they don&#39;t interest me much.<br/>
I like libraries with books that I can turn the pages of while my phone is &quot;dumb&quot; rather than &quot;smart&quot; and still has a qwerty keyboard [also has to do with being, for the most part, &quot;the working poor&quot;, the 99% and what my priorities are regarding food, bills and shiny new non-essential toys])<br/>
I was inspired by Bernie and wanted to help, to find like-minded people and rage at the machine so I struggled and stumbled through available platforms and &quot;survived&quot; attacks by shills and sh<em>tty mods by taking &quot;breaks&quot; and continuing to search for a place where people are thoughtful; open-minded enough to LISTEN to what someone is thinking about while not IMMEDIATELY being threatened by it; always, ALWAYS questioning the machine/tptb and that is aware enough to know that &quot;we the people&quot; are the answer and not pin our hopes on one person. (</em>note* save yourself the trouble, never thought Bernie could do it &quot;all&quot; or &quot;all alone&quot;)<br/>
So...my account isn&#39;t that old and your point is?<br/>
A cursory review of my posts and comments clearly and apologetically reflect what I believe and I have no trouble defending any of it.<br/>
Stop using the length of an account to discount what the person is trying to say; stop using it as a way to keep people from engaging and stop trying to divide the 99% instead of listening to them and their perspective (they might have a new angle on something YOU hadn&#39;t though of yet.)    </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s not just length, but frequency. A normal person doesn&#39;t give a fuck to comment a million times on something no matter how passionate they are on a subject. </p>

<p>But for a &quot;single mother of three&quot; to have the time to comment so often (~90 days ago) it is suspicious. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I can&#39;t figure out if this is an attack or not.<br/>
As I said, I get worn out and am worn out (donnie, russia, seaman...etc) ...I check and lurk and when I feel compelled to reply I do...end of story.<br/>
I do not have a super new phone or tech on me at all times or my head bent over one all the time while driving or walking or when standing in front of someone who&#39;s trying to have a conversation with me so that might explain the frequency question?? not sure<br/>
Again, something super creepy about people going through a person&#39;s history and making judgments and accusations but hey, whatever floats your boat.<br/>
As I said, I have nothing to hide and could give a rat&#39;s... what you think you know about me and who I am and the why of any of it...<br/>
My point was and is that the length of a person&#39;s account doesn&#39;t negate a person&#39;s thoughts or questions or ideas... it also is an inaccurate way, I think, to figure out what a person&#39;s motivations are but its definitely a way to disenfranchise a person from a group quickly and stifle any real OPEN discussion and thought.<br/>
That being said, creep...creep away... and please if you want to attack me in any way, try to grow a pair and come out and say straight out.    </p>

    <div class="md"><p>ALSO - a review of my comment history reflects I commented 11 days ago and 15 days ago....so you proved my point - you accused me of something and were wrong...why are you doing that?<br/>
Why are you making statements (or more accurately, sort of, kind of alluding to...??) about people&#39;s character/motivations that aren&#39;t even accurate??!!<br/>
WHY would a person do that do you think??<br/>
Why would a person try to divide people and disenfranchise people from thinking and speaking freely within a group?<br/>
WHY would the length of time of an account determine the value/worth of a thought or idea??<br/>
I am not threatened by another person&#39;s ideas, if I&#39;m not interested in the subject I move on, I don&#39;t creep around in their account and make false allegations or vaguely insinuate things.<br/>
If you&#39;re going to accuse people of something make sure you have your facts right...mmkkkay?</p>

Trump hasn&#39;t been president even a month yet, while millions are still suffering from actions that Clinton and Obama supported and carried out. Trump has a long way to go to get as many innocent people killed as Hillary has, yet her butthurt supporters, incapable of comprehending irony or hypocrisy, still think they occupy the moral high ground.</p>

<p>Criticizing the actions that Trump will take is encouraged, but this early in the game, anyone who was willing to tolerate Hillary Clinton and does so is a hypocrite, period.</p>

A large majority of the right arent really Trump supporters, as much as theyre just anti what the left has become. I more concerned with how 25 million oblivious people seem to all be thinking and behaving almost exactly the same way. I hate using the term brainwashed, but it is what it is.

    <div class="md"><p>I dislike but voted for Hillary and I don&#39;t usually defend her but it&#39;s not out of the realm of reality, I just like reading about conspiracy and I am seeking the truth.  There is no reason why there couldn&#39;t be someone who can do both.  Just saying, this isn&#39;t really a conspiracy.  Also, where and from what attacks are people still defending Hillary, or even still talking about her?  The CTR funds have certainly dried out by now since their influence peddling power has dropped by a ton.</p>
