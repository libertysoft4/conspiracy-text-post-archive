<p>If any thread of merit or possible robust, free-thinking dialogue pops up, 15 new posts hit the sub, and the thread is trashed by people that you know are not neutral.</p>

<p>It&#39;s funny, because no matter how hard you try, you just can&#39;t fake being genuine, even over the internet.</p>

<p>No amount of money in the world compares to being just who you are, and thinking about exactly WTF you want to.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m noticing this too. People are downvoted for asking for sources now??? Saw someone downvoted just for replying to a pro-religious comment &#39;allah akbar.&#39; Seriously? It means &#39;god is good,&#39; and it&#39;s not just a cry of radicalisation, it&#39;s the same as anyone else saying &#39;praise be&#39; or what have you. The amount of narrow-mindedness and seeking of confirmation bias in this sub is staggering. It used to be a great neutral discussion ground, but it&#39;s been flooded by folks with agendas. Research and sources, acceptance of others, and new views used to be welcome here. God damn sad.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree. Vocal fools will seek to confirm their bias and discount any source for any reason. It sucks. But if someone is asking to be educated, I think we should try and help them with that even if the anti-intellectuals shout their fallacies from the ailse. Some people you just can&#39;t reach and can&#39;t convince, and that&#39;s unfortunate, but it&#39;s also fine. It shouldn&#39;t get us so jaded that we can&#39;t help someone who&#39;s actually asking for help, you know?</p>
