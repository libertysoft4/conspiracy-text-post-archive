I went so deep down that rabbithole I dunno what to think about them anymore... </p>

<p>Here&#39;s my research after a few hours if ya want a jumping off point... they say to question everything... so I questioned that &quot;Scientologists are evil&quot; narrative pushed by nearly everyone...</p>

I don&#39;t let it feed on my brain... I deal with the root causes, but I&#39;m not exactly a &quot;normal&quot; person by any stretch of the imagination... I can see how it would take a normal person a lot of work to attain that level of mastery of their own mind... and I can see how it would be very very difficult if they experienced childhood trauma or suffered from a terrible event in their life...

<p>Did you watch the recent 20/20 episode on Scientology? One of the guys they interviewed was quite fucked up emotionally because they were trying to suppress his negative thoughts. Eventually he left the Church and sought the help of a therapist and seemed to be quite grateful of the help he received from one of Scientology&#39;s #1 enemies.</p>

<p>I get what you&#39;re saying, though, about routing out negativity. It&#39;s just that I personally know some ex-Scientologists who grew up in the Church and they have nothing but bad things to say about it. :/</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh man. I&#39;m down for anything Scientology haha it&#39;s so creepy but fascinating. My friend and I went to the Ron Hubbard museum in Hollywood. We didn&#39;t even know who Hubbard was, but the museum was free and we were broke so we went. That was some weird shit. The people there were just trying to recruit us, and Hubbard was just over glorified in this large two-story building. Bizarre. I don&#39;t regret it though. It&#39;s one of those cool stories that you get people&#39;s attention with. Haha </p>

But with how much Scientologists fluff him up, I wouldn&#39;t put that claim past them. According to that museum I went to, Hubbard did everything spectacular.

They are in league with the banks to keep us divided and at war. This keeps us dependent on their expensive weapons and fossil fuels. </p>

<p>I assume all people are racist, because, humans.</p>

<p>Don&#39;t discount my laziness. </p>

<p>All I knew about it last night was blood libel is some terrible thing neo-nazis like to throw around and probably some Jewish people kidnapped that congressman&#39;s toodler back in the day. My background is a very politically correct community. </p>

<p>Well, I spent several hours reading about it and I&#39;m kind of torn between thinking that it&#39;s strange such cases occur over such a widespread geographical area throughout history and wondering how much can really be known about historical accounts written by majorities about scorned minorities. It also seems like a hell of a way to set your religious group up for being hated by outside communities--I mean why not allow for more discrete disposal of the bodies if you&#39;re going to kill children regularly--whether it&#39;s an insult to your concept of gentiles being animals or not, it&#39;s seem tossing bodies on a trash heap is a sure fire way to make life living hell for your community. It&#39;s the most ridiculous scheme for practicing sacrifice I&#39;ve ever heard of. And why do they need Christian gentiles? Why humans at all? I don&#39;t know, it&#39;s just so far out there.</p>

<p>So, why the Jews are so hated...because of what they do or what we say they do? I really don&#39;t know what to think. Chicken vs. egg. Who knows what is true and what is rumor born of hatred? That&#39;s why I wanted modern cases, preferably in America, where I would understand the people involved (their culture, how they investigate crimes, the level of corruption in their justice system). Everyone on here thinks the worst of you when you are the least bit critically minded. It&#39;s so tiresome. Do you really expect me to accept this ritual sacrifice occurs without any question? </p>

<p>Hey, question for people who know about this topic.....are vampires supposed to represent the Jews who are said to drain the blood of people? I always thought the old fashioned vampire depictions look sort of like a racial stereotype of Jewish people. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Let&#39;s see, there are a few &quot;levelheaded&quot; conspiracies you should look into that aren&#39;t all that fabricated like others, and have plenty of historical merit:</p>

<p>-Eugenics societies of the 1920&#39;s (start at Francis Galton)</p>

<p>-Back to Africa movement of early 1900&#39;s ( or even late 19tg century civil rights, Booker T. Washington, W.E.B Du Bois[founder of NAACP)* not really a conspiracy, but interesting still.</p>

<p>-Operation Paperclip <a href="http://www.wallpaperup.com/568303/IRON_SKY_action_comedy_sci-fi_nazi_war_comics_futuristic_cgi_disney_military_horror_1ironsky_apocalyptic_fantasy_astronaut_flag_moon_space.html">obligatory</a></p>

<ul>
<li>The Huxley family (where Sci-fi, UNESCO and Darwinism collide)</li>
</ul>

<p>Soo many more out there, but it&#39;s 3am and I best be getting some shut eye.</p>
