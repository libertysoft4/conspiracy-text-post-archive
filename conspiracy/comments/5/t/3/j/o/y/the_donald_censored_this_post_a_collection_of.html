        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>We&#39;re all concerned about Pete&#39;s Zagayt, and all signs point to progress.  </p>

<p>Based on his Tweets, we know <a href="https://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/255294883680632833?lang=en">how Trump feels about child molesters and the like</a>. </p>

<p>We also know <a href="https://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/266276897305026560?lang=en">he&#39;s in the know on the Weiner case</a>. </p>

<p>We know Steve Bannon was basically in charge of Breitbart after Andrew passed, and since <a href="https://twitter.com/andrewbreitbart/status/33636278100561920?lang=en">Breitbart clearly knew about PeaszahGait</a>, we can assume Bannon does and chats with the president about it.  </p>

<p>Today <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2017/02/09/presidential-executive-order-enforcing-federal-law-respect-transnational">an executive order was passed</a> to eliminate human, drug, arms, and wildlife cartels and to prosecute all those involved and profiting off of them to the full extent of the law.  </p>

<p>So it seems coming indictments are likely.  FBIAnon suggests high profile arrests are incoming, as does journalist David Seaman, and our beloved crazy person, Alex Jones.  </p>

<p>Alex also says that behind closed doors, the outer rings of the larger abduction and sex trafficking rings are being shut down, and that some of this has been released to the media.  </p>

<p>Since Trump has been in office, we&#39;ve seen: </p>

<ul>

This one factors in Illinois and Texas, so it&#39;s another net 464 arrested on top of those.  <strong>February 5th, 2017</strong>. </p></li>
</ul>

<p>So far a total of 1,287 relevant arrests since Trump took office, 1,278 of which were on US soil. </p>

<p>Also, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/5swe5d/theyre_downvoting_this_like_crazy_here_it_is/?st=IYYXLXU8&amp;sh=510fecdb">a curious connection between 51 busted in Norway, the 9 busted in Haiti, and the Clinton Foundation</a>. </p>

<p>Any that I&#39;m missing? It&#39;s very curious to say the least.  I hope that before long, there is a worldwide purging of these monsters.  It certainly seems like there&#39;s reason to hope for that end!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>In regard to Traci Lords, she was 80s pornstar (quite popular at the time) who made a ton of movies before turning 18, and only 1 right after turning 18. Though all the early stuff was &quot;banned&quot;, it can still be found quite easily on the internet, without the need to crawl into any deep, dark, scary places.  But...unless the vid is from her last movie, it&#39;s all CP. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t know what can be done as far as instagram, etc., particularly with age being an obvious question...better parenting? An effort to make it clear the actions are illegal, perhaps by prosecuting a few underagers? It&#39;s the same issue involved with sexting, to a large extent. </p>

<p>Looks like the numbers since Trump took office exceed the total numbers from <a href="https://ucr.fbi.gov/crime-in-the-u.s/2014/crime-in-the-u.s.-2014/additional-reports/human-trafficking-report/human-trafficking.pdf">2014, for example</a>.  </p>

<p>The boom started in November of 2016, which was when he was elected, so I wonder if there was an internal &quot;go-ahead&quot; once it was known that Trump would be getting in with a house and senate majority.  </p>

<p>I posted it as an all text post without links to sources, and that stayed.  So I&#39;d wonder if it were an auto-removal of one of the link sources, but the mods never got back to me and that doesn&#39;t explain why the comments talking about the removal were removed.  </p>

<p>Also note how they are all being conveyed as &quot;sex trafficking&quot; when they give almost no evidence that most of these aren&#39;t just typical prostitution busts.

<p>the problem is that ISN&#39;T all the people getting arrested.  The majority of the people getting arrested in these stings are adult prostitutes- people who likely are already victimized.</p>

<p>This is an injustice, and the low information circlejerk by these MAGA heads which drinks the LEO koolaid is indicative of what&#39;s going down right now.</p>

<p>Arresting of-age sex workers and civilian clients is absolutely ridiculous, on the same level as the war on drugs. It shouldn&#39;t be illegal in the first place. If it was, you wouldn&#39;t have the sex-trafficking problem in the first place!</p>

<p>They dont have bosses.  They dont answer to anyone.  At least not you typical pimp.  Asian apartment massage parlors have bosses which likely are organized crime.</p>

<p>Even if we arrest say, 50 politicians, I think we&#39;re in the clear if the evidence is sufficient, that they&#39;re political enemies is irrelevant at this point, especially since historically bipartisan arrests and convictions have been made.

    <div class="md"><p>I agree. </p>

<p>Punishing pedophile rings is far more important than politics. If Trump or anyone chooses not to pursue a politician pedo because they&#39;re allies then that&#39;s as bad as the pedos themselves. </p>

<p>Disclaimer: this is all just speculation at this point. For all I know, Congress gets together and plays Settlers of Catan on weekends. </p>

<p>I&#39;m curious about this one, since that&#39;s a lot of arrests. According to the article, 128 arrests plus 28 arrests were accounted for (iirc, on mobile). What were the other ~325 arrests for?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>In regard to Traci Lords, she was 80s pornstar (quite popular at the time) who made a ton of movies before turning 18, and only 1 right after turning 18. Though all the early stuff was &quot;banned&quot;, it can still be found quite easily on the internet, without the need to crawl into any deep, dark, scary places.  But...unless the vid is from her last movie, it&#39;s all CP. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t know what can be done as far as instagram, etc., particularly with age being an obvious question...better parenting? An effort to make it clear the actions are illegal, perhaps by prosecuting a few underagers? It&#39;s the same issue involved with sexting, to a large extent. </p>
