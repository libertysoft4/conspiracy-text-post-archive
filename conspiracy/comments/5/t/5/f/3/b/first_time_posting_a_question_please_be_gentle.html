I have never felt confident posting, because it seems like the &quot;new&quot; posters are accused of being ctr and/or shills.  I am neither, I have just been too timid to comment.  I am trying to find my courage to ask a question that I have not found an answer to.  If we are all looking for conspiracies, why is no one talking about all the leaks out of the White House ?  Is no one else but me frightened by this?  In my entire life, I have never seen/ heard so many leaked phone calls with foreign leaders.  I may be a child of the Cold War, but it scares me to think what secrets are being handed to &quot;our enemies.&quot; Am I all alone in this thinking?  If so, can you tell me why I shouldn&#39;t worry about this?  It is really bothering me.  Thanks in advance.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>IMO the leaks are coming at the direction of the Administration itself to get the mainstream media to report on it, then the truth comes out (which is quite a bit different than the &quot;leaks&quot; suggested), then you point out those news organizations of being &#39;fake news.&#39; It seems like a blatant attempt (successful so far) to discredit specific news organizations. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Don&#39;t be afraid to post.  I think most people come here posting without having lurked and learned.  You put in your time.</p>

<p>(going forward is my opinion only, no facts unless stated)
As for the leaks, it seems it isn&#39;t leaking for the sake of going to our enemies so much as being leaked to embarrass Trump.  </p>

<p>A common defense Hillbots threw at Wikileaks was that WL was biased against Hill as they only released anti-Democrat leaks.  I suspect it was more that there just wasn&#39;t anything leaked yet for Trump.</p>

<p>So now he is in office and you have people loyal to old system wanting to shame him or make a name for themselves or possibly get a reward.  </p>

<p>I wouldn&#39;t worry about the leaks.  Trump seems to be the kind of guy that assumes he is being watched and listened to.  He doesn&#39;t like it, but plays it that way.  Things will calm down over time.</p>

<p>Be at peace, don&#39;t let the MSM convince you it is as bad as they say.  Come here daily and lurk to get your news.  </p>

<p>I am glad you took the time to post and ask.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>honestly our image looks awful around the world.  It seems like Trump impresses some with his strength but also offends some with that same strength and stance.  Maybe in time it will calm and he may work out to be a great patriot.  Or he may end up making things worse.  Time will tell.</p>

<p>I&#39;d recommend you turn to ways to focus on calm, and let things be that you can&#39;t control.  I meditate, I yoga, and I come here.  As you&#39;ve ditched the MSM, great.  Come by here when you can to check the TOP and the NEW, and then go about your day.</p>

<p>So just relax, everything will be ok, one way or another.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>When Trump won the presidency, he inherited a host of enemies from within that Obama was happy to give to him. The problem for Trump is that he is not really a partisan politician - he is probably more of an anti-establishment candidate than anything else. He took the republican nomination on the back of the people&#39;s interest, and the republicans had no choice but to take their best shot.</p>

<p>I think the result is that Trump needs to delegate a lot of responsibilities and I think he&#39;s in bed with a bunch of people who don&#39;t really love him. I think you have Obama people who haven&#39;t been replaced who hate his guts, I think you have republican staffers who wish he had never stolen their nomination, and I bet he has loyal staffers who are getting paid off or are jaded enough to turn on him. On top of this, the media has united into a single front and is transmuting every single action he makes or they can imagine into the worst possible version of what it is or could be. It&#39;s pretty nuts right now. It makes you question if he really is threatening &#39;the establishment&#39; as we know it, and if so, we need to be a little more mature in how we deal with all of this IMO. I truly think there is a mass psychic operation going on against people - we are being shown the worst version of reality right now. Nothing is good. Everything is bad. I say beware of the magician who lives in your TV.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Our own POTUS as much as it may pain some in this sub believes in conspiracies. </p>

<p>Never be afraid to have a voice! </p>

<p>I think people don&#39;t talk about it cause some of it seams unbelievable. I personally brought up a twitter account by the name of RoughPOTUSStaff and it just looked off. They said stuff that made no sense. Now I&#39;m not saying it can&#39;t happen but with the fake ones it really makes the real ones look off so it&#39;s hard to say anymore. You have people like CTR or whatever they call themselves now trying to create havoc and raising money to do it. You have a current POTUS issuing a ban a previous POTUS issues but no one objected then. Again I&#39;m not saying some can&#39;t be true but wow what a time we live in. Hillary herself made conspiracies real by saying Lawinsky and bill was a conspiracy and look at how that played out. That&#39;s just one example. </p>

<p>Voice what you think but pose it as a question or back it up by research! It could be an eye opener. We all welcome it!!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, you are right.  What is happening is that the people in charge are incredibly incompetent...so much so that thgthgey know they can&#39;t fight stuff like everyone using encryption, so they make it illegal and force backdoors in your devices and software.  They roll out a healthcare system website that is the worst website rollout the world has seen, an ongoing disaster for a system that is also a disaster</p>

<p>They pretend to know technology, and try to tell us it will be used to manage society, but they are lawyers who only legislate it while criminals within a &quot;secret government&quot; (the CIA) which took over on 9/11 are very good at using technology...most to globally manage various crime cartels and ratlines ...and to manage false flags to embroil us in wars as a false cause to use taxpayer funded public military to  engage in profiteering, colonialism and other vicious crimes.</p>

<p>These disclosures younare seeing OP, are the fruiting of karma, the people around the world have had enough banker&#39;s wars, enough expropriation of less sophisticated brown people&#39;s god given natural resources, enough child sex trafficking, enough illegal organ harvesting and human experimentation, enough weird military-intelligence caste occultism and psychological,  nonlinear warfare</p>

<p>So you are seeing them revolt by shining light and creating a mass awakening.  They can&#39;t fight with violence or they are greasgreastly outmatched.  So they are fighting with information.  In a fiat, virtual digital currency based world, money is simply information too, as much as it is potential for sea change</p>

I think I understand what your saying.  But if the contents of the links don&#39;t matter, wouldn&#39;t our &quot;image&quot; be hurting we the people the most?  I.E. looking weak and foolish?</p>
