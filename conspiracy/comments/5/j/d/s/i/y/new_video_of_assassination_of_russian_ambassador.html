    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ll ignore your childish comment. You ask &quot;why is it surprising that a Syrian would assassinate an enemy ambassador&quot;. Your statement is inaccurate on its face, as Russia is not an enemy to Syria. Therefore the Russian ambassador cannot be labelled an enemy ambassador to Syria. The particular Syrian (if in fact he is) that carried out the assassination is not representative of the Syrian nation since Syria and Russia are politically allied. What <strong>is</strong> surprising is that a person like that could get so close to that situation. This &#39;Syrian&#39; is in actuality an enemy to his country.</p>

<p>The way he yelled snackbar snackbar made me chuckle, it was like he wanted us to believe he was a muslim, the whole thing felt forced. </p>

<p>Camera guy just stands there taking pictures with steady hands, makes me believe he knew it would happen and he was safe all the time.</p>

<p>Israhell is always in mood for a good war, and seeing the increasing support for Russia and decreasing support for us/israhell it would make sense that they want to conduct a false flag at this time trying to force Russia into a conflict. </p>

<p>He seemed like a professional not a radical.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know how easy it is to get a job as a security guard for an ambassador but I bet mossad could get you that job, I don&#39;t think al snackbar could get you that job.</p>

<p>Screaming &quot;Don&#39;t forget Aleppo&quot; while killing a Russian government employee is to push the western propaganda that Russia is enemies of Syria and the mercenaries trying to overthrow the legitimate government is actually &#39;the good guys&#39;</p>

<p>Syria and Russia are friends, this is trying to make a split between them. Divide and Conquer. </p>

<p>Where is the blood? I can&#39;t see a single drop.</p>

<p>The killer and the whole event resembles all the useful idiots I have read about, from Gavrilo Princip to Jack Ruby.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Question though. If Turkey just had a violent coup attempt, and is very very antagonistic towards Russia, then WHERE THE F*CK were the guards for the Ambassador? I mean they (the Turkish guards) apparently &quot;knew&quot; the cop so let him in.(Which is suspicious enough anyway...) But how and why did this Ambassador not have heavy Russian personal security considering recent events? </p>

<p>I don&#39;t think it&#39;s Mossad. I think its Russia. That&#39;s my gut.</p>

<p>Especially considering another diplomat in Russia was found dead the same day, in his home. (Perhaps retaliatory by some other agency? Who knows...)</p>

<p>Putin was &quot;taking care of business&quot; in some way. And killed two birds with one stone. Think geopolitically, how it is to his advantage to further demonize/destabilize Turkey (Turkey is an asshole enough anyway but digress.)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Never take your eyes off the ball lol but I always found it crazy how people just dart in a straight fucking line away.</p>

<p>People are really shit at shooting. Cops manage like 1 hit a mag, because they all train on stationary targets or rigid movement and use handguns.</p>

<p>Training for conflict regions has people moving like a game of dodgeball. You running away in a straight line is as good as you standing still as the shooter can keep their eye and sights moving together. It doesn&#39;t work when moving unpredictably.</p>

<p>Why do you think in WW1 they chose rifles and bayonets when we&#39;d had revolvers for a long time. Rifles lock your eyes and sights by connecting it to your torso with the shoulder stock, and the longer barrel means a truer shot. Take a 4ft straight edge (level or something) and a pop straw and try and point them at something 100 yards away. If you traced the line almost any idiot could get the 4ft within inches of the target, but the straw being 1/32nd of an inch out of line would have a miss by yards.</p>

<p>The faster firing the weapon the more spray and pray it is. Weapons like the P90 empty 50 rounds in 3 seconds as they&#39;re hip fire full auto. It&#39;s a personal defense weapon designed for like a humvee or truck driver if they get ambushed. Spray, pray, and run.</p>

<p>So learn to run half spasticated, it could save your life if the world goes to shit like we all half expect.</p>

<p>Proclaiming otherwise is dumber than dumb.</p>

<p>EDIT: that guy was supposedly special forces trained. He had rigid trigger discipline, and clearly was trained, with his squared stance, correct two hand stance, and just business like execution.</p>

<p>That trigger discipline...that&#39;s gross motor memory. Equals training. That was a fairly dangerous man.</p>

<p>This assassin had pretty good training, with trigger and muzzle discipline like he displayed. I don&#39;t think he ever even covered the AP photographer.</p>

<p>I&#39;m doing my best to stay ahead of a few other things lately, and I have lost some perspective on Syria as of late. I&#39;m not sure yet who could have set this guy in motion.</p>

<p>His name has Jewish heritage. Photos of his mother and sister show them without any kind of hijab. IMO muslims cherrypick their faith anyway, but very very little about this guy really says &quot;radical islamist&quot; to me. Could be mossad, putin, turkey...

<p>that trigger discipline.... I can&#39;t stop thinking about that.
 I&#39;m twice his age, and been shooting competitively for twenty years. I was a certified range officer at 11. I have trigger discipline, twenty years of it. I still catch myself, once in a while, with a timer going, riding the trigger when I know I shouldn&#39;t. </p>

<p>He&#39;s twenty two years old, kills an ambassador, but has that discipline, in the face of oncoming assailants? My finger would&#39;ve been all up on that trigger.</p>

The killer didn&#39;t kill them simply because he was shocked at the sight.</p>

<p>I think your premise might be right at distance with a sniper.  Versus running away from one, random movements seem possible to increase survivability if there are multiple targets.  But figure a shooter like this guy in a small room and his obvious training would kill whomever he wants.</p>

<p>Yes someone was murdered and my condolences go to the family. I still find funny the way the shooter acts, it&#39;s interesting.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The camera from the front that was aimed at the podium, in wide angle mode, where you can see the shooter move back and forth and take up his position at the side and back of the ambassador, was on a tripod. It was zoomed in and out and jostled out of its original position immediately upon shots being fired, but remains steady otherwise.</p>

<p>You must have seen another video. I saw another video where the camera is zoomed in closer up (head and shoulders) on the ambassador and was apparently handheld.</p>
