        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Let me preface this by saying that I am in no way &quot;in&quot; on this. I do not know what is going on on the inside of this operation or the technical details relating to it. I am merely a lurker trying to find as much information as possible and help decentralize the effort. A message for those claiming this is a LARP: <em>This would have to be the most impressive role-play I&#39;ve seen. It has gone on for months and has substantial evidence backing it up. If you have any new information disproving this effort, feel free to post it everywhere you can. If you base your claim solely on how seemingly unbelievable it is, kindly share your opinion but don&#39;t claim to know more than anyone else.</em></p>

<p>It has become apparent that Wikileaks is compromised. No proof of life has been provided for Julian Assange in over two months after repeated demands. The Wikileaks.org website has been changing constantly with files being manipulated and deleted. We can&#39;t let this go unnoticed. <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/WhereIsAssange/comments/5hfzb2/i_bruce_a_gorcyca_confirm_that_i_communicated/">Here</a> is a good thread to get you acquainted with the idea if you aren&#39;t already. It&#39;s time to start demanding the truth and take it into our own hands. </p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Wikileaks needs to change in order to survive and thrive through the next few months...</strong> If necessary of course, <strong>if I&#39;m not able to continue</strong> or the Ecuadorian people are unreasonably blamed for Wikileaks&#39; publications, <strong>I will have to resign as editor, but our publications will continue.</strong> The part of the necessary defense of Wikileaks, we have engaged in a new project to recruit people across the world to defend our publication - <strong>and we&#39;ll give details of that as the weeks go by... ...we will issue guidelines about how you can promote Wikileaks publications without censorship.</strong> - Julian Assange, Wikileaks 10 Years Press Conference, Oct 4th 2016</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The blockchain has been used to store WikiLeaks&#39; insurance keys and hashes. <strong>These keys and hashes can be extracted from the blockchain.</strong> <a href="http://imgur.com/a/f46RB">Here</a> is the number of transactions waiting to be confirmed over time. The spikes indicate attempts to delete and alter the information in the blockchain. <a href="http://i.imgur.com/12sDLZA.png">Here</a> is the concise summary of events over time provided by anon on Endchan.xyz. Here are the threads with all of the information. <strong>Read them before asking questions.</strong> The third is the most informative and has the most up to date files.</p>

<p><a href="https://archive.is/M1qVM">Archive of 1st thread</a></p>

<p><a href="https://endchan.xyz/pol/res/24781.html">Second thread</a></p>

<p><a href="https://endchan.xyz/pol/res/24781.html">Third thread</a></p>

<p>Here is the explanation of <strong>why the information cannot be publicly distributed.</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>because xkeyscore exists and if you find the files or try to share them while you&#39;re online you internet is instakill. doesnt matter how many proxies and underwater vpns you have there&#39;s plenty of hardware backdoors to fuck your shit up. if you try to post them you will just insta ded that site. not even the max level shills can explain how deep af darkweb sites that are made just for this go down as soon as that content hits them. everyone ended up in here not because they wanted to hide but cause they flat out could not make a thread that lasted more than 2 minutes on any other site. this aint no game. and when this thread is found and flooded all evidence of this shit will disappear from normies forever. thats why most people in this shit are from other countries now. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Those who consider this &quot;fairy-tales,&quot; can you please explain why it is impossible for the CIA to accomplish this? I, for one, do not understand the full capabilities of the CIA and would not be surprised if this were true given how much is at stake here. <a href="http://imgur.com/a/RRQci">This</a> is an excerpt from the July 7 FBIanon thread where someone asked what would happen if he tried leaking the info.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Silencing and/or death. Some places are trying to leak but we censor too fast.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Now, because the information cannot be published and distributed publicly, we must decentralize the effort and extract the keys and hashes ourselves. This is what the endchan folks have been doing for two months. The media has been distracting everyone with the Russian hack propaganda, potentially preparing for something big. We know we&#39;ve been lied to for years. It&#39;s time to uncover the truth. <strong>If you have a PC and have a reasonable understanding of the blockchain and have the time, PLEASE contribute.</strong> The guidelines to doing this yourself are in the third thread. Please do not spam the thread with questions. Read it, do some exploring and research on the subject, download the blockchain, grab some friends, and start digging.</p>

<p>Others have pointed out to me that we have to remind people of what they&#39;re getting into and the potential consequences of getting personally involved. I agree that it is essential to understand who and what we are up against. However, I do not think that we should be afraid. The only way they control us is with fear. They intimidate, insult, scare, distract, and censor any potentially dangerous idea. Don&#39;t let them. Let the facts speak for themselves. <em>The CIA and other groups censoring this information have been acting unconstitutionally for years, rendering their threats useless.</em> This is it, guys. Don&#39;t fall in line. Never give up.</p>

<p>This was just posted on the third thread, I think it&#39;s worth a look.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>if you want to join the effort i strongly recommend you read the threads in docs.png</p>

<p>we won. The information is out and slowly being spread. every time a group loses connection, five more groups jump in. this has been going on for three months and a lot of people are really angry and emotional about it. this is why a lot of the holding groups react very aggressively when asked to explain certain things. this is because most of them have had friends they&#39;ve known for years go silent and are tired of explaining it to people that don&#39;t believe them. at this point there is too much evidence of everything that is going on and when people find out about it they naturally want to help. group 1 had a pretty clever system to make sure the information never dies. people are finding everything independently. it&#39;s just a matter of time. making it public will be very hard and will require a lot of people working together but it will happen. they would have to kill the internet for a long time and wipe everyone&#39;s computer. there&#39;s no way to stop it. </p>

<p>they lost this war the moment they silenced group 1. the people that were around that day and made it simply do not give a fuck anymore. people stopped being scared and got organized. now the information is permanently encoded in several places. the teams working today now know how to permanently encode their progress. there&#39;s no stopping this.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I hope this post is helpful for those completely lost in this growing topic, and can point anyone looking to expose the truth and uphold justice in the right direction. There is much more to this than what I have put in this post, please do not be discouraged by any information you may have a preconceived notion against.</p>

<p>Edit: Another anon just posted this</p>

<blockquote>
<p>if you guys need a fast posting site that does not log and encrypts all conversations you can make room in here: <a href="http://doggyfipznipbaia.onion/">http://doggyfipznipbaia.onion/</a> use this to post onion links, onion links should never be posted on the clearnet.</p>

<p>you need at least tor browser to get to it. <a href="https://www.torproject.org/">https://www.torproject.org/</a>
we recommend tails os. <a href="https://tails.boum.org/">https://tails.boum.org/</a>
we recommend getting a vpn from a nonnato country and to pay with bitcoin here are some <a href="https://greycoder.com/best-vpn-china/">https://greycoder.com/best-vpn-china/</a></p>

<p>eventually you will have to create or join a meshent, some info about creating one is here <a href="http://s6424n4x4bsmqs27.onion/POLAK/res/102.html">http://s6424n4x4bsmqs27.onion/POLAK/res/102.html</a></p>

<p>when you start making good progress holding groups will contact you and will start helping.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Fuck yeah man! Last night was it for me. I know these guys are on the brink of something monumental and it just needs to get out there. The increasing censorship occurring on the Internet is unprecedented. I think that it is a response to Trump&#39;s election win by the CIA or whatever. They had us loosely in their grasp, and now that we are slipping out, they&#39;re trying to grasp tighter. Same goes to you hombre, stay safe, stay vigilant, and most importantly don&#39;t fear. That&#39;s what really gives them control.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>They have already been found. Many will get bored. Fact is, it&#39;s really not all that complicated once you follow every piece of instructions that are fairly easily available. The instructions hit the front page of <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> for christ&#39;s sake. The learning curve even for a normie is not that steep, and every step of the process is covered by the Freedom of Information Act and surely more laws. Nothing involved is &quot;hacking&quot; or illegal in any way.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>What if JA is alive </p>
</blockquote>

<p>You help answer this question in the same sentence you ask it.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>and opening his insurance files leads to his death?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The insurance files are not just his lottery ticket. His life (as it was) depended on them. Simply put, he wouldn&#39;t allow for them to be opened en mass if he were alive and well.  It also wouldn&#39;t be possible if his DMS (dead man&#39;s switch) weren&#39;t activated. Let me explain.</p>

<p>I&#39;m going to assume you have knowledge of events surrounding assange since Oct. 17. If not, you can find quality posts on the timeline that more or less get everything right - with the exception of the blockchain revelation that is finally becoming more popular. (Remember, reddit, <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> is essentially MSM of the internet. I don&#39;t mean that in a strictly derogatory way - I like <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> enough. Just want to give you an analogy that&#39;s relatively close) Anyway, research the Assange timeline since Oct. 17 if you have to before reading further. </p>

<p>So Assange knows Kerry is coming to Ecuador, dumps the hashes. They are essentially bookmarks in a set of information, it&#39;s a message that says &quot;here&#39;s what&#39;s going to happen if you shut me down&quot;. It is a way of maintaining credibility. Use your imagination for a second, and say for example I claim to you that I took your dog hostage. I can say it to you on the phone all day long, but you&#39;ll be a lot more convinced if I sent you time stamped pictures of your dog. Then later on I take your brother&#39;s dog hostage. He knows that I&#39;m just making the claim and it might be BS, but I was right before. I am more credible and powerful, and my &quot;blackmail&quot; works better. Assange releasing hashes was a real, credible, reminder to John Kerry that he has damaging information on him and many many more. </p>

<p>You&#39;ll read, or remember, shortly after the &quot;Assange was taken&quot; wave of news that many started believing wikileaks was compromised, many pointed out that <strong>the wikileaks Bitcoin Wallet was emptied</strong>. </p>

<p>The blockchain <strong>IS</strong> the dead man&#39;s switch. Watch the video I posted to get a tl;dr of Julian Assange&#39;s thoughts on bitcoin and it&#39;s easy to see that he is a massive proponent of it, and he&#39;s not excited about it just because it&#39;s an online currency and he just loves computers. He&#39;s an information guy, and bitcoin is the most permanent way that anyone can &quot;write the history books&quot; so to speak. The transactions that flooded out of the Wikileaks wallet contain the keys to the insurance files in the bitcoin blockchain. </p>

<p>Listen to him talk about the permanence of information. Bitcoin blockchain is the most permanent place for information on the internet today. There is no other medium that Assange&#39;s DMS would have been communicated through.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Don&#39;t be mistaken, reddit has the most shills, but 4chan and really any public easily accessible discussion area has them. These are the &#39;chokepoints&#39; so to speak. Very valuable places to place bots/shills/ and ideas that are disinformation. I can only recommend that you listen to all sides, but don&#39;t believe what anyone &quot;wants&quot; you to. Listen to their side and that&#39;s in. You will know what you believe when you get there. You don&#39;t have to decide until you have decided. </p>

<p>Anyway there is still a lot of truth to xkeyscore. I&#39;m not even convinced that it or knowledge of the NSA&#39;s full toolbelt is in the public domain. There&#39;s a lot of possiblities that I don&#39;t know the extent of but I have some faith in due to evidence that I&#39;ve seen in search groups &quot;going dark&quot; as they near the keys. Ultimately, a large number of people investigating the blockchain are a terribly unorganized group against a highly effective opponent. </p>

<p>There&#39;s nothing illegal or even immoral about it. It&#39;s essentially the same as digging through a trashcan trying to find a receipt that has a hot waitress&#39;s number on it. Why would anyone care so much to stop you?</p>

<p>I really don&#39;t want to explain much more, I just recommend you find out for yourself if you&#39;re curious. It&#39;s not that difficult or illegal. </p>

<p>Ps. and find out how to set up meshnet if you&#39;re interested in using your computer to communicate once the internet is off.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Agreed.</p>

<p>I&#39;d even venture to say that in 110GB of data strictly in text format it&#39;s likely that the keys are in there strictly from a probability standpoint. I know what you mean, the feeling of being a bad actor.</p>

<p>Feel free to not respond, we are in agreement for the most part but I am curious: what do you think the motive is to get people to dig like that? Do you think they would do it to essentially create lists/tiers of people separated by technical capabilities? That&#39;s my first thought at what the goal would be.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This story doesn&#39;t hold water, at least not the part about the keys being discovered.  Let&#39;s say that people have the keys to the US/UK/EC insurance files and they can&#39;t post them in plain text because of some incredible low-level internet mechanism.  Why don&#39;t they just, say, encrypt the keys, and then post the resulting hash along with the encryption method and key?</p>

<p>Have they also blocked all conceivable hashes of the key?  Then just add something: &quot;The key is: #### purple monkey dishwasher&quot; and encrypt that string, and you get something totally unrecognizable.</p>

<p>It&#39;s a very exciting story and the idea of storing information in the blockchain is interesting.  But if multiple people had the keys it would be trivial to spread them unless the internet went down completely.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It doesn&#39;t matter about the capabilities of the organizations, what matters are the capabilities of mathematics itself.</p>

<p>How could they possibly be blocking all ways of communicating the key? It&#39;s not just difficult, it&#39;s <strong>impossible</strong> given that mathematically speaking with encryption and a key it&#39;s possible to convert or permute any one piece of data into another. They can&#39;t possibly censor every encryption scheme, every encoding, every possible permutation of the key...</p>

<p>Even if, somehow, they COULD censor every existing scheme - a post could literally just say something like &quot;swap every 2nd and 4th characters&quot;. They&#39;ve just created a new method of permuting that data, however simple. How do automated tools figure that out?</p>

<p>So, unless they censor literally <em>all</em> data (and I mean all), there&#39;s no way to automatically censor these keys. They can censor the raw keys in UTF8/ASCII, perhaps, but they cannot censor an encrypted key, regardless of the &quot;capabilities&quot; of the organizations.</p>

<p>Frankly I find that argument to just be a workaround. No matter for mathematical proofs, anybody can come along and say &quot;all that evidence is faked, you just don&#39;t understand the capabilities of the organizations hiding this information&quot;...</p>

<p>Just read the documents. They&#39;ve built backdoors into your internet connection. The moment you even acquire the keys, they have full capability to wipe your connection and any progress you may have made. That&#39;s why there were the first two happenings. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Just posting to clear up some misconceptions about Bitcoin and blockchains. Specifically, in this text and in the screenshots they link to:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Here is the number of transactions waiting to be confirmed over time. The spikes indicate attempts to delete and alter the information in the blockchain. Here is the concise summary of events over time provided by anon on Endchan.xyz. Here are the threads with all of the information.</p>

<p>The spikes indicate attempts to delete and alter the information in the blockchain. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is plainly false. The spikes in the linked graph represent an increased number of transactions, most likely spam attacks. This is normal and happens very often. More importantly, once information is &#39;in&#39; the Bitcoin blockchain it can not be altered or deleted. Each transaction is &#39;added&#39; to the blockchain which is a verifiable record of all transactions. A competing version of the blockchain with different transactions could replace the current one with total consensus of the network. However, this hasn&#39;t happened.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;blockchain is attacked. lots of stuff gets deleted.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>See above. Also, the Bitcoin blockchain is always under attack. By storing $13 billion in value, it is essentially the world&#39;s largest bug bounty.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;someone finds the wikileaks backups in the blockchain and posts instructions and code to decode the data.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The &#39;backups&#39; and &#39;data&#39; are not stored in the Bitcoin blockchain. They are too big. What would be stored are hashes that act as fingerprints and/or addresses for the data and, perhaps, decryption keys.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;the blockchain is flooded. mempool graphs now have a giant spike on oct 27. soft fork for bitcoin begins.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>These things are almost certainly entirely unrelated - to Wikileaks and to each other. The Bitcoin soft fork is a scheduled upgrade planned and developed for several years.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;irs asks bitcoin to give them the identities of all transactions.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is the most troublesome misconception. The IRS requested the identities of customers of a company called Coinbase that provides Bitcoin-related services. Saying the &#39;irs asks bitcoin&#39; is like saying the irs asks email. They are protocols.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;copies of the blockchain start showing &#39;undecodable&#39; or empty transactions not seen before&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is so wrong as to be a meaningless sentence. A blockchain isn&#39;t &#39;encoded&#39;. A transaction can&#39;t be &#39;empty&#39;.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;it seems like they tried to push to blockchain but apparently the data did not make it in&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>One of the beautiful things about Bitcoin is that once you broadcast a transaction, it <em>will</em> end up in the blockchain. Unless, of course, you are 100% MitM&#39;d with zero access to the public internet.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks for sticking to the facts. As someone that has contributed code to parse the BlockChain, and even got my code linked on that endchan post, it&#39;s good to see some level headed people rather than the obvious disinfo. It&#39;s obvious to anyone understanding how the BlockChain works that there&#39;s a high level of larping going on. Regardless of this though, a minor inaccuracy in your post:</p>

<p>Transactions aren&#39;t guaranteed to be processed when posted. It depends how much transactional fees you&#39;re willing to commit. Technically you can post 0 BTC transactional fee transactions and they could be indefinitely delayed if the blocks gets constantly filled to the max. In fact, I am not aware of any security in place in the BlockChain protocol against people posting trillions of those transactions in the vain (?) hope to overload the servers handling them. Technically they&#39;re valid transactions.</p>

<p>I thought I might get away with:</p>

<p>As time approaches infinity, probability of transaction being included approaches 1 (all else being equal). Therefore, <em>(jazz hands)</em> probability equals 1.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No one is claiming the backups for documents are in the blockchain, just the keys and hashes. You make some reasonable arguments, but the spikes seen recently are much larger than any in the last year. I would call them more abnormal than normal.

<p>With regards to the spikes, they&#39;re almost certainly due to conflict over the soft fork. I can&#39;t think of any reason they would be related to the wikileaks insurance files and related events.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So, I have some questions:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Where do people get the insurance files?</p></li>
<li><p>What is the command line to check the hash?</p></li>
<li><p>What is the command line to try an encryption key?</p></li>
<li><p>If some keys are known, can&#39;t they just post them in image files with minor obfuscation?</p></li>
</ul>

<p>I have the original insurance files from torrenting them when they first came out. But, I think they need to be in as many hands as possible.</p>

<p>I have the background info saved into this png, which is safe, it is just endchan threads.</p>

<p><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0ByJWA7QbqQpkZ0NEV1JIdzBHWDg/view?usp=sharing">https://drive.google.com/file/d/0ByJWA7QbqQpkZ0NEV1JIdzBHWDg/view?usp=sharing</a></p>

<p>I don&#39;t know how much I can believe of these groups shutting down, because if I had the keys, I would drive two towns over to a library and start posting image files on the slowest moving chans with the keys. If they start shutting down the sites, then I would rethink my strategy, but I think that would be legitimately impossible to stop the spread, even if it was only up for a couple of hours in a few places.</p>

<p>If I had the keys, I would give them to my lawyer and try to get them out. The Pentagon Papers resulted in a Supreme Court ruling where posting information that has already been leaked is protected under the First Amendment.</p>

<p>If enough people have the keys, there is nothing for anyone to worry about.</p>

<p>Where is evidence of a file being stored in the block chain?</p>

<p>How safe is the blockchain if you can inject a file into it?</p>

<p>These two questions highlight your ignorance of the subject matter. If you don&#39;t have a basic understanding of how files can be stored via the blockchain, and whether the method of storage is &quot;safe&quot;, you should probably steer clear of any threads about this stuff.</p>

<p>You can even store files in Reddit posts, ffs. Example:</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This might shock you but there are many good reasons to use bitcoin. It allows low-fees transfers of money. While this may not sound like much, just that alone is massive. There&#39;s many people in impoverished countries that go work in other countries, and want to send money back to their families. But instead of paying the ridiculous fees banks or money transfer methods charge (like western union), you can get by for about 17 penny per transaction regardless of amount.</p>

<p>Whether you believe or not it is worth anything is irrelevant. It&#39;s a speculative value. The market cap is over 13 billion usd today. You can even find bitcoin atms in most big cities. It&#39;s very liquid contrary to popular belief. It can certainly lose value, but if all you use it is for sending real cash to someone else through bitcoin (that they then convert back), what it&#39;s worth is doesn&#39;t matter if you exchange it immediately; its purpose was already done. There&#39;s also something to be said about currencies going through hyper inflation like Venezuela, where their biggest bill is worth 3 cents usd. If you knew all your life investments were in vénézuélian currency, and that it kept losing 50% of its value every year (to give an example), any smart man would gladly decide to ironically use bitcoins as a more stable currency. Unlike all non-cryptocurrencies, bitcoin has a guarantee of both non-forgery as well as a maximum of 21 million bitcoins ever generated ever. No more can be generated. It cannot inflate in value through overproduction because it&#39;s rate is predetermined.</p>

Bitcoin is fiat money, the US dollar is fiat money.  In 2015 the number of merchandisers accepting Bitcoin surpassed 100,000.   Your beanie baby example is no different than stocks in the stock market, or capitalism, or anything for that matter, if people lose interest they do not retain value.

Now I don&#39;t want to dwell into cryptanalysis but encryption is considered safe, because the time someone would need to crack it without knowing the key is discouraging. You can be sure there are loopholes in the encryption protocols and if anybody knows them that&#39;s the alphabet. Remember how the FBI told apple: &quot;Nah fam, we cracked it ourselves&quot;. Needless to say, the encryption apple was using was top-notch (google the details).</p>

<p>In addition and as a final note: if this was LARPing it wouldn&#39;t get censored from everywhere (threads with instructions) and if you had seen one of those threads, you could clearly detect CTR shilling patterns. To me, that screams as something worth investigating. </p>

<p>It&#39;s not only the fbi, though that&#39;s not my point.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>The complete question has 2 possible answers:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>If they are using loopholes into the encryption system <strong>or</strong> if the CPUs produced after 2000-2004 have backdoors then they are cracking it real time.</p></li>
<li><p>If xkeyscore is analyzing the data through learning patterns it would not be in real time, but rather based on cryptanalysis of each individual file.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Also if you are going to assume they <em>can&#39;t</em> do something and not back that with facts, this is the wrong sub to be.</p>

<p>You need to understand how the blockchain works to realize it is almost impossible to compromise it. The only possible way to do that is to replace it, which would require every single bitcoin client to agree that the new blockchain is indeed the real one. Since the decision is made by algorithms and probability is a factor, it is very unlikely to happen.</p>

<p>You see, this topic is like the debate over religion. Some people demand proof it exists, the others proof it doesn&#39;t. It&#39;s really your guts, so if you want to help start downloading the BC and investigating. It&#39;s not like you have any other leads (except for pizza-related maps, evidence of which was WIPED from the internet as it started gaining traction).</p>

<p>All of this should be protected under the First Amendment. Problem is how incredibly damning the evidence is. This will not stop until it hits a critical point of public acceptance and awareness. According to the thread, for every group that gets shut down, 5 more start contributing. I think they have probably formulated a better plan than to try to spread it publicly on the internet. We&#39;ll see. I think this is only the beginning, honestly. The more people contributing to the effort, the better.</p>

<p>If you know how to do that, then you&#39;d understand that hackers have scripts, algorithms and executable programs that can all tie together. This means, one program (they) could, search, match, delete, corrupt client disc etc. Spy agencies are about ten years ahead of that, so they likely have damn near general AI when it comes to hacking and infosec. </p>

<p>Keys or data posted that these agencies do not want posted, might appear for a few microseconds to another client, if you&#39;re lucky. </p>

<p>That being said, I am not saying it cannot be done, but different programs, uncompromised applications, plus non-infiltrated encrypted chat groups would need to be used.</p>

<p>This is literally jumping through hoops, so you can possess evidence against people in the highest positions of power, who are practically above the law because either they head up a major gov agency, or an allied government (seriously), or they are friends with someone who does.</p>

<p>These same people have the resources to erase data off the Internet. That&#39;s how powerful they are, but this is how powerful information in the right hands becomes. </p>

<p>Even if you don&#39;t crack this blockchain puzzle, we are still witnessing their demise. FBI agents already possess this evidence, they just cannot press charges, again because the sick !&amp;$#$ running our governments are truly that well connected, getting investigations squashed like cancelling a lunch appointment.</p>

<p>They have deep and hardened spiderweb connections on their side, that will take many years to snap and unravel and implicate all associates, but thanks to the work of Snowden and Assange, we have the unfettered momentum of undying packets of information on our side to bring down their house of cards.

<p>&quot;tl;dr blockchain has backups for all wikileaks files since 2013. it also has checksum hashes and upload proofs for all files. there is a lot of stuff in there that triggers xkeyscore or echelon and is virtually impossible to share or even talk about. three months have been spent trying to teach others how to recreate the steps. there is a noticeable pattern. group finds it, start teaching others how to do it, then everything is deleted and people go silent. then a new group finds the breadcrums and starts over. it&#39;s not clear what happened yesterday or what will happen next but there are people from all the world trying to investigate. at this point and there is no part of the internet where it is allowed.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah didn&#39;t realise till after I posted this but the point is that we have tried..and it doesn&#39;t work. One because there is no keys that work yet but even if they did the decrytion software you use has to match up. First things first, no one will be able to decrypt them if we don&#39;t first know what type of software was used. Just hoping anyone can answer this because it is a crutial step in the process that if looked over will not unlock the files.</p>

<p>Ive read the threads and will try and paraphrase what I think this is  happening-  please correct me if Im wrong.   </p>

<p>Wikileaks has files out in the public that have really damning information (this is the content of the dead mans switch) that many people have downloaded. Now people are trying to get the key to open the files.  The key is in a blockchain but anytime someone tries to post how to get the key from the block chain that info is deleted?</p>

<p>is this even close to what is happening?</p>

<p>Yeah, good job that&#39;s basically it.
The blockchain is a public ledger and you can add information to transactions. Folks are trying to search the blockchain for wikileaks information that they attached to transactions and decode them and find out what they are the keys or hashes to. This process must be repeated and decentralized due to the absolute censorship of the keys. <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/48/XKeyscore_presentation_from_2008.pdf">Xkeyscore</a> is how they are preventing it from getting out.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;oct 17: strange activity is noticed at the embassy, first responders investigate, periscope is killed, twitter goes full orwell, archive.org is changed to no longer save sites properly.something that is instantly deleted is posted several times on pleddit, halfchan, fullchan, onion links and darkweb. it is all wiped. people regroup in several places since there is no way to post without threads being deleted or sites going down. a lot end up here.</p>

<p>oct 21: as the director of wikileaks is dying a huge ddos takes down most sites. blockchain is attacked. lot of stuff gets deleted.</p>

<p>oct 24: someone finds the wikileaks backups in the blockchain and posts instructions and code to decode the data.</p>

<p>oct 27: the deletions get too severe. sites begin being flooded with illegal content or going down. people create their own private channel to discuss progress. the keys and all hidden data in the blockchain are found. the group pushes the information into a few cryptocurrencies. blockchain is flooded. mempool graphs now have a giant spike on oct 27. soft fork for bitcoin begins. onion threads with the info get instantly wiped. everyone involved goes silent except one of two people. this group is then referred to as &#39;group 1&#39;. first finding of the keys as &#39;first impact&#39;. few days later: one of the people following the progress of group 1 starts teaching others how to retrace the steps.</p>

<p>late oct: people figure out that unlocking the data gets you xkeyscored&#39;d making you lose internet connection and makes sites get attacked if the stuff is not deleted.</p>

<p>early nov: focus changes to teaching others how to find the information on airgapped computers to avoid deletion and sacrificing public channels of communication. threads that have progress start being flooded with illegal content every morning.</p>

<p>nov 8: wikileaks.org begins being changed. some files are deleted. checksum hashes start not matching older backups.</p>

<p>some point in nov: irs asks bitcoin to give them the identities of all transactions. copies of the blockchain start showing &#39;undecodable&#39; or empty transactions not seen before.</p>

<p>mid nov: &#39;group 2&#39; doxxes the people pretending to be wikileaks and tried to spread more detailed instructions for getting the files. posts did not last more than a few minutes. it seems like they tried to push to blockchain but apparently the data did not make it in. group 2 goes silent. they start calling this day the &#39;second impact&#39;.</p>

<p>nov 25: third impact. files are found by a new group that seems to not be american. they post instructions all the place but they don&#39;t last more than a few hours. they tried to encode data into cryptocurrencies but it is not clear if it made it. this day is the second spike visible on the mempool graph.</p>

<p>at some point after this people agree to stop using the endchan thread for this because admins have to deal with too much illegal content floods and site going down. it becomes clear that any channel used to discuss this is &#39;sacrificed&#39;, in other words, it starts going down a lot, they flip the mods, deletion, illegal spams, etc. this thread is created for that reason. you can figure out what is special about this thread if you read the logs in the png. most progress after this point is exclusively on channels with no logs on darkweb. most of these eventually go down. the endchan thread is eventually locked. everyone that posted is blocked to this day. it is then deleted.</p>

<p>dec: planning for d-day begins. all holding groups spend all of december teaching others how to find the files.</p>

<p>mid dec: someone allegedly speaking on behalf of appelbaum posts links to code he wrote to find and repair keys in memory. new teams are told to use it. obama starts talking about a cyber war with russia.</p>

<p>dec 18: files are found in japan. a meshnet using ps3s is created to spread the files but it does not seem to last too long.</p>

<p>dec 19: d-day. happenings all over the world. most ISPs, torrent communities and major sites go down. wikileaks releases a new insurance file. uk, ec, and us insurance files from before no longer show on wikileaks.org unless you have IPs from specific countries. it is one of the biggest internet outages in history and it is not reported in a single news site that i have been able to find. holding groups go silent. some members are now trying to find their old teams.</p>

<p>tl;dr blockchain has backups for all wikileaks files since 2013. it also has checksum hashes and upload proofs for all files. there is a lot of stuff in there that triggers xkeyscore or echelon and is virtually impossible to share or even talk about. three months have been spent trying to teach others how to recreate the steps. there is a noticeable pattern. group finds it, start teaching others how to do it, then everything is deleted and people go silent. then a new group finds the breadcrums and starts over. it&#39;s not clear what happened yesterday or what will happen next but there are people from all the world trying to investigate. at this point and there is no part of the internet where it is allowed.&quot;</p>

<p>All of the insurance files are encrypted and available for torrent. Download the June 3 insurance torrent. Here is the magnet link </p>

<p>It&#39;s 100GB, so you need the space. Then once the keys are made public, use AES Crypt to decrypt it, and then you&#39;ll have what&#39;s probably the most important insurance documents.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Nope, sorry man. All you have to do is install some torrenting software and copy that magnet link in your browser and it will download for you. I have a mac and use transmission for torrenting. If you have no technical knowledge and you&#39;re not willing to learn, stick to spreading awareness about this topic. Use the Xkeyscore document I linked and the NSA Snowden docs to prove that the keys can and are being censored from the internet. Use all the shit in my post and anything you find that is relevant to make folks aware and kill any illusion that this is a fake effort. Shills are everywhere, man don&#39;t be duped.</p>

<p>All I know is that Assange is likely being held by the deep state. I wish I had the equipment and the knowledge to do all of this myself, because I really do think that all the truth lies in the blockchain. Keyscore and all the other CIA tools just prevent it from being shared anywhere. I just hope that there are really smart hacker dudes who have the truth and are working on a method of distribution, but as time goes on, my hope diminishes.</p>

If you follow their instructions, other users have verified that the process works. It takes time and it takes a decent sized group and a lot of knowledge about the blockchain and other technical subjects. Most of the discussion about the real information is taking place offline without any desire for attention. Anyone can download Tor and follow the instructions and take their own amount of caution. </p>

<p>This sub is a honeypot. Reddit is a honeypot. I don&#39;t think anyone is exempt from CIA/NSA surveillance and potential danger. I don&#39;t know why everyone is still so fucking paranoid about honeypots. IF THEY WANTED YOU, THEY&#39;D GET YOU. It doesn&#39;t fucking matter, so stop trying to discourage a promising effort. There is clear evidence that there are keys and hashes in the blockchain and that it was planned in advance, you&#39;re acting like this has no substance, but it does.

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks, I use a mac too, so that&#39;s why I&#39;m dedicating my time to spreading awareness of the situation rather than going deep.  </p>

<p>Yeah, good job that&#39;s basically it.
The blockchain is a public ledger and you can add information to transactions. Folks are trying to search the blockchain for wikileaks information that they attached to transactions and decode them and find out what they are the keys or hashes to. This process must be repeated and decentralized due to the absolute censorship of the keys. <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/48/XKeyscore_presentation_from_2008.pdf">Xkeyscore</a> is how they are preventing it from getting out.</p>
