    <div class="md"><p>Providing information should not be considered a conspiracy unless it obfuscates other information.</p>

<p>It is the onus of the redditors to determine the legitimacy of conspiracy information, posts shouldn&#39;t be removed on an individual&#39;s belief of the information. </p>

<p>And I&#39;m not sure where you are getting off saying they aren&#39;t conspiracy? They relate to the hidden (or not so hidden) social construction of the modern world.</p>

<p>The multiple posts are consolidated into a single post. But that post quickly shuffles to the bottom of the list and I am grateful that it is linked in the relevant posts.  Also, much like with the Wikileaks and other major political developments, having a single thread when multiple issues arise from a single event dilutes the conversation on those individual problems as users are forced to sift through unrelated content to find information about singular issues.  I, personally, think that having single posts for each issue is a good way to have a discussion on the relevant topics without the white noise of other conversations.</p>
