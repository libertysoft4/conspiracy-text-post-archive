        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I think it&#39;s time to realize that they&#39;re different people in this world. Everyone has their own personality, habits, and sexual orientations. You would think by now we as intellectual species would realize this and stop fighting over race,sex, and other completely idiotic none sense. We go to wars with other countries with thousand of people dying everyday to fight for what? Freedom? Pride? I don&#39;t get how killing another soldier brings pride. That same soldier is in the same shoes like you,fighting for the same illusion so called freedom.   It makes no sense how one is fighting for freedom on one side and the other one is fighting for freedom on the other side. So what I don&#39;t get is, how are we so stupid to not realize that we&#39;re being put against each other. Freedom is for all, not for one side of the planet and no the other. A white BMW is same as black BMW just a different layer outside!!!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>People don&#39;t trust each other. </p>

<p>Our brains are designed to learn from our observations, and to learn what is a threat and what is not from this process. We aren&#39;t born with the knowledge that bees sting people, but we don&#39;t have to be stung, ourselves, to learn early in life that bees can you sting us and it hurts (and is possibly fatal if you have a severe allergic reaction).</p>

<p>It&#39;s the same between different demographics. People can read about history, look at statistics, etc and our brains are wired to form logical conclusions about the probability of threat based on the details of a situation (and more specifically the details of an animal or person, etc). </p>

<p>So then one&#39;s brain is neurologically programmed to learn this way, and once a perceived threat is identified, it activates the fight/flight/freeze response, a physiological survival mechanism meant to respond to perceived threats.</p>

<p>Then those emotions make it even more difficult for us to think clearly, which is just part of being human. It will take time and those who lead by example to create new learning experiences/observations significant enough to override the previous learning of most people. It would also need to get enough media coverage, which is very challenging when the whole of the MSM is just a big propaganda factory.</p>

<p>For example, there are organizations of Jewish people who oppose the way that Israel treats Palestinians and oppose funding the destabilization of the Middle East, but you will have to actually go online and search for them, because the MSM isn&#39;t going to show you. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You nailed it with soldiers by calling it illusion. I was in the U.S Army. In basic they drill you to be obedient, disciplined, and to follow orders without question. The last live fire exercise in my basic was a course where they were blasting Islamic prayer incantations over a p.a. while they shot live rounds of .50 cal, and 5.56 m4, m16s over our heads. We had to low crawl under barb wire through sand and make it to the end without standing up/ freaking out. I understand the reasons for this. But the illusion comes in when you think the voices coming through the speakers are inherently the enemy, not fellow humans. </p>

<p>The point is, soldiers are fed the illusion of the current &quot;enemy&quot; at the time. </p>

<p>Now, and i may need a tl:dr after this, i was in basic with a great soldier.... actually the best soldier there. He was an Iraqi man who served as an interpreter during the Iraq war for a unit of Marines. He was Muslim. Had a copy of the quaran which he let me read a bit... it was VERY similar to the christian bible, but he was the most loyal and impressive soldier there. All of the drill sergeants loved him. I could go into his firefight stories another time, but not here.</p>

<p>So. Tl:dr, every war that the u.s. is involved in, the soldier is fed propaganda and made to hate/fear the opposing side. This makes sense for war, but is an illusion and detrimental for human evolution. The best soldier in my basic training was basically the enemy of what they were trying to prepare us for.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is all due to the system of control and domination that the elite have placed this world under, and its effects run deeper than most people care to imagine or admit. </p>

<p>It has conditioned the vast majority of people into negativity, whether that be negative outbursts of violence or emotion, or negative thought patterns, or negative desires, or negative beliefs about oneself and reality. </p>

<p>People have bought into and firmly believe the narrative that the elite have told everyone and they continually defend it and thus defend the system of the elite, since the narrative is the life support of the system.</p>

<p>I made a post about one thing that could bring down the system of the elite and undo all of the damage it has done to people&#39;s minds (exactly what you are describing here), and that thing is Atlantis. When we, as a species, truly know where we have been, then we no longer believe the narrative that the elite have forced upon us and that in turn will lead to its destruction. That then leads to the destruction of the system of control and domination of the elite.</p>

<p>So read <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/5jq50l/i_think_some_day_soon_something_about_atlantis/">my post on Atlantis and the elite</a> and read all of my other posts regarding this topic, including the replies to other people on that thread.</p>
