    <div class="md"><p>They do it in so many ways now. </p>

<p>I could almost write a paper on this shit. It&#39;s interesting to me. </p>

<p>As well as being obvious. Not only from a profitability standpoint, but obviously from a manipulative and agenda standpoint as well. Or just from a simple information standpoint. </p>

<p>It&#39;s literally ALL connected. Facebook. Snapchat. Email. Debit card purchases. Internet search history. Audio from your microphone. Video from your camera. Gps signal. Wifi connection. Who&#39;s wifi you&#39;re connected to. Who you are sending a message to. Why. How long you talk. The context of the conversation. Where you were during, before, and after said conversation. What apps were used while the conversation... and so on and so forth. </p>

<p>And with the power of cloud computing and analytics, you can start to piece together BIG data. </p>

<p>Cross analyzing trends amongst other users by matching data points over a period of time. </p>

<p>Then, throw in a simple variable. Say for example.... oh idk... how about, withholding positive Facebook posts and only showing the negative ones.. and watching how that impacts absolutely everything else. </p>

<p>There is no stopping this now. We let this happen.  </p>

<p>MAYBE. Maybe... if we stopped using the internet.. </p>

<p>Seriously, I did away with CIA book when I went thru my divorce because so many of my friends were my spouse&#39;s friends and I figured I&#39;d start a new one when I got around to it. This was back in 2012. </p>

<p>Yes, sometimes I miss getting to see some family pics, but if I really want to see them I work it out by actually contacting that family member. But seriously, there is no amount of free service that makes me want to give up that amount of privacy. Not anymore.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I mean, yes. Definitely stop using Facebook. Glad to hear you did as well. Now if we could just get everyone else to stop too.. and bring that horrible person zuck back to just being a normal everyday person. That would be cool. </p>

<p>That said, the entirety of the internet is built of the backbone of the government. </p>

<p>Even tor browser is well known to not actually be private. </p>

<p>There is somewhat of a stalemate going on here. Criminal activity is completely monitored and tracked. Analyzed. Stored. Used. </p>

<p>The reason nothing is done about it or before, is because it will kill the effectiveness of. If TPTB took down a ring of criminals using the internet, they would be acknowledging that they are in fact listening at all times... then regular people would be scared. They would come to their senses and leave the internet alone. </p>

<p>But that isn&#39;t what they want. So it doesn&#39;t happen. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I noticed this a while back. My take on it is with data mining and big data, they can correlate so many things that often you have already &quot;telegraphed&quot; this yet to be had thought on-line or subconsciously in conversation by using pre-cursor keywords to the actual thought. In other words, the same pre-cursors keywords that eventually lead you to having the thought, before you have it, are correlated from existing data points and the same potential conclusion arrived at by automated systems as is arrived at by your brain. </p>

<p>Or it&#39;s magic thought stealing, which actually sounds more likely, after reading my weak-ass attempt to explain my logic above.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Whoa, that&#39;s nuts because I was just recalling yesterday how this has happened to me a few times. I&#39;ve thought of something I needed to google, just typed the first and/or second letter and BOOM! It auto-completed the word.  Yes, I know google does this but the fact that it was just one letter or two at the most when it was some obscure, random thing I thought about..??  It&#39;s also happened with ads and something I thought about, and then holy shit, there it is! Coincidence?  Honestly I hope so because anything other than that would be terrifying.  And all of a sudden I&#39;m wondering about those &#39;crazy&#39; people who are &#39;allergic&#39; to wifi.  Maybe they&#39;re onto something.  Wifi is everywhere now too. </p>

<p>Turn a web radio talk station to a language you don&#39;t know (e.g. if you are an English-speaking American, find a Spanish or French station) and leave your phone by the speaker overnight and see what kind of ads you get the next day</p>

    <div class="md"><p>When our mexican house cleaners are over I get spanish ads on youtube.  When I&#39;m near my middle eastern neighbor&#39;s house the ads are in their language.  The other day at work someone said they want to buy wireless xbox controllers, and the first ad in the corner of a webpage was wireless xbox controllers.  I&#39;ve had more coincidences than this, but these examples are all from the past 2 weeks.

    <div class="md"><p>I have had this happen to me. I use an iPhone (yeah I know..) and don&#39;t have Facebook installed, I only use it through Safari. What I do have installed is Instagram and I believe it&#39;s this app that is picking up on my conversations. I know this because its one of my few apps that I allow use of the microphone and its where I see a lot of correlation between my conversations and the ads I am shown. It&#39;s very eerie and I haven&#39;t figured out how to stop it other than ditching smart phones all together. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I honestly believe if it is running as an ad targeting mechanism (which is primarly what I believe Facebook would use it for), they would simply run the voice recognition locally and fire off text based queries to the ad server. </p>

<p>It would have virtually zero effect on your data and produce the same result for Facebook and their advertisers. </p>

<p>Wrong subreddit to downplay a conspiracy I know but I don&#39;t genuinely believe they&#39;re recording us. Could they? Probably, yes, it&#39;s definitely something of a slippery slope but I don&#39;t think we&#39;re at that point. The data transfer would easily be measurable. </p>

<p>Myactivity.google.com</p>

<p>For most people this is probably enough and will make them shit their pants once they realize what they are looking at.</p>

<p>But if that&#39;s not enough, go ahead and search for your &quot;Voice Searches&quot; or whatever its labeled as. (If you have been using &quot;Ok Google&quot;)</p>

<p>Play one of the recordings and you will find that it begins before you even say &quot;Okay Google&quot; </p>

<p>You also hear the vibration and the noise that always made you think THAT is when they started listening.</p>

<p>Like, &quot;Okay Google&quot; you can start listening</p>

<p>Little did you know, you gave them that right a long time ago.</p>

<p>If this is actually a thing and not just anecdotal then it&#39;s almost certainly a locally run word recognition service that just returns ads based on phrases that it identified and queried to the ad server. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Recording with the mic is nothing special coding wise as it&#39;s one of the most common things apps do, so this is all basically set up for developers with code examples in the sdks for devices. The recording part isn&#39;t a conspiracy really. What is a conspiracy of sorts is the other frameworks available to developers that let you record a sample and then analyze certain ranges of frequencies for codes. The conspiracy part is TV ads have these codes embedded in them. Also youtube and other online videos. Ever heard of shazam? The app that you can record music and it identifies it? That algo and similar ones are used to parse recordings and identify these signatures. So of course speech is pretty common and it can pick up key words and forward the information to the company that then sells that info. Pretty sneaky, but to me the embedded signatures in tv ads that these tools can identify is the collusion part. I think one toolkit was called silverfox or something and there was a list of apps that had it so people could uninstall them. Of course these days they all have something. </p>

<p>Is it possible you could elaborate or point me in a direction to research what you&#39;re talking about here?</p>

<p>I agree with what you&#39;re saying I just don&#39;t understand 100% what you mean by these tv adds having &#39;codes&#39; embedded in them. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>When I&#39;m not on mobile I will present you some good info/articles. It works like this. </p>

<p>Human hearing range is from 20hz to 20khz roughly. It varies and gets worse with age. High frequencies are very distant sounding and mostly just sound like a high pitch whine. </p>

<p>1) A TV ad is made and in post production a high frequency sound out of human hearing range is added to the audio with a unique signature. This plays over the TV, but you don&#39;t realize it&#39;s there, because you can&#39;t hear it.</p>

<p>2) A software company is approached to add some functionality to their software to gather marketing information. In exchange, they get paid based on the info they gather. It becomes part of their business model to make money on their free app, just like regular ads. </p>

<p>3) A developer making an app at this company is provided a software development kit for implementing this market information gathering. They implement it as per the instructions provided and it&#39;s pretty straight forward. They don&#39;t need to know the internals of how it actually works. They test to make sure it works, and then they deploy their app as usual. </p>

<p>4) You install this game. On iOS you just install and don&#39;t care. On android you give it permission to use your mic because you don&#39;t care to read the prompts. So you&#39;re playing this game, Candy Crush or whatever, and you&#39;re sitting in front of your TV watching a show. Candy crush is listening. An ad comes on and candy crush hears the signal. It records that you&#39;ve watched that ad and it sends a message to say you&#39;ve watched that ad. </p>

<p>So what&#39;s the point? Well on top of the fact that they record and listen for key words of your actual voice, they now know everything you watch everywhere you are. These codes are in movies, tv shows, ads, the whole shebang. </p>

<p>There are lots of articles on it. Search &quot;high frequency tv apps listening&quot;. It&#39;s not even a &quot;conspiracy theory&quot; it&#39;s fact. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Coincidence? In your case, I would say probably yes. If you said &quot;I was talking about <em>obscure product X</em> and then got an unusual ad for <em>obscure product X</em>!&quot; then it might have been from listening in. I can&#39;t imagine anyone would bother listening in to tell someone who MIGHT be coughing that lung cancer treatment is available. I don&#39;t know if a computer could even accurately tell when someone is coughing versus when someone is clearing their throat or merely rubbing fabric up against the microphone.</p>
