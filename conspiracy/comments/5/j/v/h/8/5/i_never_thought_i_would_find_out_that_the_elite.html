    <div class="md"><p>When you take the claims of Podesta being involved in the Temple of Set, it does make sense.  At that point you&#39;re talking about Egyptian Mythology that goes back to the time of Genesis (considering the book of Genesis wraps up with Joseph, the Pharoah and saving Egypt from famine -- circa 1750 BCish).</p>

<p>It&#39;s not as though these belief systems died with a culture, and then were found in a dusty old book and someone said &quot;Hey guys, this looks like fun!  Let&#39;s give this a try!&quot;  It&#39;s been passed along for centuries...  For millennia....</p>

<p>For all the depictions in movies and literature of the Illuminati or &quot;secret societies&quot;, among the elite controlling and manipulating the Matrix-like reality in which we exist, there&#39;s never been a real threat to them.  Even if one or two fall, there are others furthering the cause right in front of our faces that we&#39;ll never suspect.</p>

<p>It makes me wonder their endgame.  Their motives.  For something to have endured for so long, it requires some mutual benefit for the disciple.  What do they gain?  Power?  Money?  Why do they further the agenda?  Where is it all going?</p>

<p>Perhaps this is the sort of thing that we are to consider when it was asked &quot;What does it profit a man to gain the world but lose his soul?&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>i am pretty sure all evidence points to the  God of the old testament being a demi-God worshiped by Jews. Not the Divine creator. Jesus says he came to fulfill the prophecy of the Law not to continue it or validate it. The prophecy was that a messiah would come. He contradicts the Law many times. stoning, eating pig meat, retribution, the after life, hell and damnation. Certainly if the Law of the old testament  was divine Jesus would never have to come to dissolve it. In fact, what he does is refute all the barbaric shit of the old testament , because it was not divine but just barbaric human bullshit. He also freed the masses from the control of the greedy rabbis who take from poor in the name of God, and fill their temples with their goods. Jesus retored the Divine Law from demi-God law. Divine law  was mercy and love. No fucking Hell and damnation. Jesus retored Law of the creator for all. No church or Rabbi needed. No temple needed. No middleman or Guide needed. </p>

My theory is very controversial and usually met with skepticism or ridicule. I genuinely believe this to be true: When you die you will be pulled into the &quot;Fake Heaven&quot; which is actually an Astral Holding Area. After a period you will be judged by the &quot;Archons&quot;. They will then say you must return for &quot;More Lessons&quot; and to remove &quot;Karmic Debt&quot;. Both are complete scams. Your memories will be erased and you will be reinserted into this hellhole. We are used over and over as &quot;Energy Slaves&quot;. The Archons are Parasites, and the Earth Global Elite work for them.. Google: 1)Archons White Light 2)Archons Reincarnation 3)Archons Lords Of Karma 4)Archons Reptilians 5) White Light Trap 6)Gnostics Archons 7)Illuminati Archons 8)Illuminati Lords Of Karma 9)Reincarnation Memory Erase. If you take the time and google search all these, you will come across a large amount of information.. It is much worse than you could imagine. If you google search what I have listed, you will come across an enormous amount of information. Watching &quot;David Icke&quot; videos on youtube will explain everything and is something everyone should do. Much of what is considered &quot;insane&quot;, later proves to be happening.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes. Humans currently live in a state of egoic consciousness. Meaning, we believe we are our thoughts, which make up an image of ourselves. The best way to explain it is by using pride as an example. Pride, to me, was my dad telling me I needed to be a certain someone, so I spent my life trying to be that someone, and would be offended when someone said i wasn&#39;t that someone. Eventually, after a bunch of suffering, I let go of that pride because I realized it was an illusion. It was a collection of thoughts and memories and ideas, which hold no basis in reality. The truth is that we are the consciousness, the awareness, that sits behind our entire experience of existence and silently watches, hears, tastes, feels, and smells. What we are on the inside is energy too. The &quot;I&quot; feeling is really just an energy field but we have allowed our brains to associate the &quot;I&quot; feeling with memories and thoughts. That energy has no center. There is no &quot;I&quot;. There is no personal will. Rather, there just is what is. Consciousness is God. We are God.</p>

<p>Edit: I actually agree, but use an entirely different reasoning. Thermodynamics. Which states: </p>

<p><em>&quot;The law of conservation of energy.
This states that energy can be neither created nor destroyed. However, energy can change forms, and energy can flow from one place to another. A particular consequence of the law of conservation of energy is that the total energy of an isolated system does not change.&quot;</em></p>

<p>Life, consciousness, is in itself, energy. It has to go somewhere when you die.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yezzir. So funny how we all understand intellectually that we are energy, which is neither created nor destroyed. Yet, we deeply fear death. I will say...I&#39;ve been pursuing enlightenment for some time now and there is undoubtedly a more intimate form of consciousness once you understand that the thing for which you think is an illusion. We all think for an ego, which is a collection of memories. It isn&#39;t real. All that&#39;s real is the energy that is. </p>

<p>No matter what reasoning we use, we&#39;re going to arrive at the same answer if we&#39;re devoutly honest. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>There are indeed people who do terrible things in the name of Judaism that have nothing to do, in my opinion, with being actual Jews.</p>

<p>As for &quot;the real Jews&quot;, I don&#39;t know what your friend means, but yeah the rest are normal people (except for Orthodox) with a shared cultural heritage trying to figure out how to fit an aging religion into a modern framework. </p>

<p>The shared cultural heritage allies many of this group with the first group, as they see the first group protecting all Jews. And that allows the first group to hide behind cries of &quot;anti-Semitism.&quot; But many others (like me) see what&#39;s going on and want to have nothing to do with it. But when you or anyone talk about &quot;Jews&quot;, you&#39;re still talking about me. And I&#39;m not a psycho. </p>

<p>So yes, your friend&#39;s analysis is basically correct. But there are subtle in-group dynamics of deception, fear, and in-group loyalty that are very difficult to talk about, for many reasons. </p>

<p>Bottom line is, though, I think (EDIT: know) the vast vast majority of Jews are not at all what the other Jews paint them to be. </p>

<p>Fully agree. But that is an awakening journey many have yet to go on. </p>

<p>And yes, any unawakened group is merely a piece on the chessboard. But Jews don&#39;t deserve extra hate for being similar in that way. Disappointment, maybe. Because of the potential. But the disincentive to action is also higher, for many reasons. </p>

<p>We are the Christ that saves it. The mystery behind the 2nd coming is that the 2nd coming refers to the return of our senses (a departure from insanity). </p>

<p>Jesus is the Creator Son of this sector of the universe and he might become visual for us but the 2nd coming refers specifically to the return of human senses. For ages, we have been thinking insanely but this is all about to change and lead to the Golden Age or we will suicide the planet. It&#39;s up to us. </p>

<p>Our modern world has changed so rapidly from how people used to live that we look at history books or even black and white photographs and they seem like a different world.  But human nature has not evolved in step with the technology.  Human beings physiologically have remained largely unchanged for at least 200,000 years.</p>

<p>Human beings today are no different than the tyrants and barbarians you read about in past times.  Many have just gotten better at hiding their true nature.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Huh, and here I learn that many people in this community actually believe in a God and Satan.</p>

<p>When you&#39;re dead, you go into the ground and you&#39;re dead. That&#39;s it, in my opinion. No more, no less. People are assholes and commit horrific crimes and abuse because that&#39;s what humans have done for thousands of years. The worship of a nonexistent idol is nothing new. I think people being monsters because that&#39;s who they are deep down is far more frightening than most of these theories here.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t fault anyone ever for having hope of something beyond this world. I, personally, find a lot of issues with most religion.</p>

<p>For instance: I think when people say others are doing fucked up things because of their worship of Satan/Lucifer (whichever is the correct term depending on the person in this sub) it hides the fact that the only truly evil thing is that specific individual or group and instead places blame on an imaginary figure. </p>
