<p><strong>Why doing this is important:</strong></p>

<p>This sub has a serious problem with the mod-team not doing what it&#39;s tasked with doing and <em>the only thing they seem to respond to is a critical-mass of user feedback</em> <strong><em>via modmail</em></strong>. </p>

<p>If you are displeased with the continual drop in quality of the sub and the rise in sensationalism and source-free disinformation (aka misrepresenting opinion, &#39;conspiracy theory&#39; or editorial as definitive fact in post titles) then please take a moment and tell the mod-team that you would like for the rules to be enforced uniformly and without bias or exceptions. </p>

<p>(And <em>thank you</em> to the couple/few remaining mods who still try to uphold the rules by the letter.)</p>

<hr/>

<p><strong>Story time:</strong></p>

<p>I resigned as a moderator here last month because I had exhausted myself trying to reason with the dominant/loudest mods who, I am sad to have to conclude, simply don&#39;t understand the purpose of the rules here. I despise hypocrisy and wasn&#39;t comfortable with my name being associated with it.</p>

<p>For a long time I gave them the benefit of the doubt. I politely tried for <em>months</em> to get them to understand the point of the rules or to get them to explain why they believe that the rules should be selectively ignored and undermined and why they thought that that kind of hypocrisy benefited the sub. When mods such as myself actually applied the rules (or merely just added &#39;misleading&#39; flair) to &quot;front page posts&quot; (an arbitrary catch-all term that was strangely never defined) they were often met in internal modmail with childish outbursts, angry demands, base &quot;conspiratard&quot; style intelligence insults and other personal attacks. It&#39;s become like <em>Lord of the Flies</em> since 4chan invaded The_Donald and swarmed in here too, and all because the vocal majority of mods seem to think that post karma (brigading be damned) trumps the rules. I have proof of all this but won&#39;t be leaking modmail discussions due to reddiquette. <a href="/u/9000sins">/u/9000sins</a>, the second oldest mod here, also quit last week for similar reasons. </p>

<p>I <strong>love</strong> this sub and have been an active member since 2008. In late 2015 I was asked to help mod due to my participation here and elsewhere on reddit in combating trolls and defamation propagandists (see: <a href="/r/NolibsWatch">/r/NolibsWatch</a> and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/search?q=author%3Atheghostofdusty+subreddit%3Aconspiracy&amp;sort=relevance&amp;t=all">my post history here</a> - <a href="https://www.reddit.com/search?q=author%3Acrackduck+subreddit%3Aconspiracy&amp;restrict_sr=&amp;sort=relevance&amp;t=all">2</a> - <a href="https://www.reddit.com/search?q=author%3Akingcontext+subreddit%3Aconspiracy&amp;restrict_sr=&amp;sort=relevance&amp;t=all">3</a>). I modded diligently and fairly for nearly a year before I quietly quit in disgust/protest. In that time I saw some great teamwork in modmail discussions and modding, but I also saw and some terribly naive, nonsensical behavior and witnessed outright insubordination be rewarded with unilaterally made rule-changes to retroactively protect the rogue mods who actively modded against the rules (behavior which rapidly undermined all the <em>years</em> of hard work the mod-team had put into educating the community about why the rules make the sub a better place).</p>

<p>This sub is governed by mob-rule among the handful of active moderators. There is no leadership. Emotions and &#39;truthiness&#39; steer the ship. The only way things are going to get better is if you, the community, can convince the &quot;screw the rules&quot; faction that they are ruining the sub with their unwillingness to do what they are supposed to be doing. In modmail discussions relating to this I repeatedly asked if they would like to remove or modify the rules that they disregarded so that the hypocrisy wouldn&#39;t be so glaring, but I was conspicuously ignored every time.</p>

<p>It&#39;s up to you guys, the longstanding active members of this sub, to steer the ship. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s already happening, OP specifically has argued disingenuously and then had a mod remove my comment when they &quot;claim&quot; they were attacked. The traction this post has is deeply concerning. </p>

<p>OP will call you a Trump supporter and regurgitate MSM newspeak, while using all the steps in the book and then starts crying censorship when someone points out that a duck looks an awful lot like a duck. </p>

<p>I&#39;m sure this post will get removed, because apparently pointing at someone&#39;s actions and letting people draw their own conclusions is considered a &quot;personal attack.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think you are freaking out for no big reason. The mods are running this place with the spirit of rules in mind. If an OP makes a mistake by putting few caps, Mods can react hysterically or responsibly. If a post has many comments then taking down becomes a form of censorship. Rules are there, but they don&#39;t have to be followed blindly if all they do is cause more harm. It&#39;s like charging an old senile lady with theft when she accidentally  walked out with a store item in her hand. You can&#39;t always follow orders just cause they are given to you.</p>

<p>Black and white. They were quietly approving posts with half the words in all-caps when the rule was this way. When called out for it they whined and lobbed personal attacks. Almost like they were trying to make the sub look like two-faced hypocrites.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Looks like we&#39;re getting closer to the root of the issue.</p>

<p>/puts on mediator cap</p>

<p>I&#39;ve had a post deleted for containing two or three CAPS words at the end of the title, while another post with CAPS got to stay up. It seemed like a mod took the opportunity to troll me just for breaking a petty rule, so I decided not to re-post it without the CAPS. I viewed it as the mod hurting his own sub and userbase. So I can agree with you here that selectively enforcing the rules can lead to problems and upset users. Removing a post someone else spent time writing is going to come off as a negative action almost every time. Every time it happens to me, I come 1 millimeter from unsubscribing this sub and deleting my account to stop wasting my time here. But at the end of the day life goes on, it&#39;s really minor in the music of everything happening. Drastic measures are usually not necessary.</p>

<p>You have some soul searching to do my friend. Are you familiar with zyklorpthehuman at all? I don&#39;t know him, but he&#39;s a regular contributor here. Why not take a more pleasant stance towards him to figure yourself out and the situation at hand? Moderators are not immune to criticism, they should expect it and react gracefully. Users might feel miffed over your actions in the past, do you not care?</p>

<p>Mods have to use discretion. Once rules are set in stone and strongly enforced, people will just find a way to skirt the rules and submit low quality content another way, or use the rules to annoy mods and get people banned, or whatever.</p>

<p>Rules should assist with keeping low quality content to a minimum where necessary <em>to empower the users</em>, and this is a human process which makes it open to interpretation, but when moderation is heavy handed and starts infringing on users&#39; time spent here you&#39;re going to have problems. Chances are that a user spent more time putting together their thoughts and self post than the mod who had to flex a muscle to hit the &quot;remove&quot; link. Maybe not, but you get my point.</p>

<p>Why piss off a user who had good intentions and wanted to be part of this sub? To favor rule enforcement? Even when some misleading post title makes it to the top, it&#39;s not going to stay there <em>forever</em>. Flair is all you need for that and it seems to be working so far.</p>

<p>Not everyone here wants to see you or others get frustrated to the point they have to bail out. Relax about petty personal attacks, quit telling others to message the mods and steer the ship, stop worrying so much about rules, and check out the authentic user interactions and conspiracy theorizing happening all over this sub; it is a great thing that I hope you can be part of.</p>

<p>Maybe that&#39;s the problem, not participating enough with the actual users here. That&#39;s a problem for a lot of mods. Try it sometime. Show us some of your theories and critical thinking skills. Impress us. Show us some failure. Feel humiliated sometime. Nobody can be right about everything. It&#39;s life man, just live it. If something bothers you, it&#39;s easy to express your concern or avoid it and find something else to focus on. If you feel like you&#39;re not making an impact or whatever, try another approach, another topic or subreddit for a while.</p>

<p>Is this before or after the rule was changed? Do you remember when you posted it? Some mods were ignoring the rule and purposefully approving violations that they subjectively liked, and in doing so making us all look like wishy-washy hypocrites.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Are you familiar with zyklorpthehuman at all?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes, he lobs personal attacks at me regularly. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Why not take a more pleasant stance towards him to figure yourself out and the situation at hand?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You don&#39;t think I tried? I&#39;m always respectful and pleasant until someone proves themselves beyond any doubt to be malicious and uninterested in civil discourse. If a guy on your way to work tried to spit on you every day would you continue to walk by him and wave?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Users might feel miffed over your actions in the past, do you not care?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Every action I took was completely justified by the rules of the sub. The mod-log is public.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Mods have to use discretion.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Then why have rules? Double-standards are hypocritical and hypocrisy reeks of deceit and/or foolishness. This sub is fundamentally against that kind of behavior.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Why piss off a user who had good intentions and wanted to be part of this sub?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;m not psychic and neither is anyone else. Their intentions are <em>irrelevant</em> if they break a sub rule. That&#39;s the crux of this problem IMO. Most mods seem to think that they&#39;re psychics. Subjective enforcement muddies everything and makes having mods at all pointless.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Flair is all you need for that and it seems to be working so far.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The vocal majority of the mod-team viciously and angrily reacts to a mod applying flair. &quot;Let the votes decide&quot; they say. &quot;Let the comments call out the lies&quot;, despite not recognizing the fact that the vast majority of redditors site-wide only read headlines. Sad but true.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Try it sometime.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Again, been here for 8 years as a user. The vast majority of my comment and post karma comes from here. </p>

<p>So the gist of this seems to be &quot;the rules are just for show&quot; and should rather be called etiquette suggestions, correct? Isn&#39;t that hypocritical? Does hypocrisy not strike you as disconcerting?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Because I think what you said is important and increasingly relevant, I&#39;m going to xpost a comment I shared with <a href="/r/WhereIsAssange">/r/WhereIsAssange</a> the other day.</p>

<p>Users need to understand how subs and forums can get <em>compromised indirectly by rule zealots</em> because it always creeps up at some point. I saw attempts in <a href="/r/WhereIsAssange">/r/WhereIsAssange</a> and also /v/Pizzagate.</p>

<hr/>

<p>Typical formula, easy way to trash a sub.</p>

<p>Make throwaway accounts you use to attack other users, create a problem for the mods to solve by enforcing a new rule (no personal attacks), then make more throwaway accounts to further antagonize those same people you previously attacked (by acting like a master shill) into breaking said rule. A valid word (shill) becomes a bannable offense and the sub has been degraded into political correctness territory with selective censorship. Mods gain power and authority over others, because now they have to enforce new rules and take a stance against things they shouldn&#39;t have to. Before you know it, a system of authority is established, and then these same shills start to abuse it even more by annoying/overworking the mods and then comes their offer to join the mod team and help out with all this hard work (mod takeover).</p>

<p>There&#39;s a fine line to draw, I think the line should come between calling people names like idiot or retard or shill, and harassment and spam. No reason to throw freedom of speech and expression out the window in favor of political correctness, especially on internet forums where people are mostly anonymous.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t mod subs though, so I don&#39;t know the first thing about how to run one successfully.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think you guys are seeing this way different than everyone else, literally everything getting voted up is trump propaganda, if anyone says anything about it &quot;they&#39;re a shill&quot; if anyone says they&#39;re getting tired of it &quot;they&#39;re a shill&quot; if anyone makes a post like this &quot;shills are trying to kill this sub&quot; believe or not, not everyone is a fucking shill, </p>

<p>We get it, reddit took the trump cults megaphone away and not being able to ruin reddit for everyone anymore really bugs them, but it just sent them on a war path to kill the fringe subs; you guys are killing subs that other people use to enjoy........... </p>

<p>It&#39;s probably a safe guess to assume that everyone like OP, use to come here for more than just reading  made shit up about democrats and are honestly just tired of all the trump cults shit......... </p>

<p>seriously, go to the new post, more than half the stuff showing up isn&#39;t even conspiracy related it&#39;s news articles that you guys want to make wild and unsupported links back to Hillary or podesta or Obama or the DNC honestly just stop, try talking about chemtrails or Bigfoot or aliens from the 8th demension of mars or literally something besides all dem bashing all day, keep that shit I&#39;m t_d where people actually enjoy it because we all don&#39;t want to sit here and eat the shit coming out of t_d like you guys do 24/7.......... </p>

<p>but noooooo now I&#39;m shill, and it&#39;s not you guys  ruining the sub it&#39;s all the shill&#39;s and who are the &quot;shills&quot; oh yea literally everyone questions the cult&#39;s narrative or doesn&#39;t jump in these circle jerk,  </p>

<p>I seriously hope the mods start cracking down on all this shit, and then this trump cult can be so butt hurt about being censored that maybe it&#39;ll inspire them to go to finally just leave and go to Voat, then this page can go back to normal finally.......</p>

<p>Maybe just start a /MAGAconspiracy sub or even DEMconspiaracy you guys are truly ruining this one for everyone else and I look forward to it getting corrected </p>

<p>The NY Times feels that way too. They do a bit of hand-waiving, say some magical words, and PRESTO! Magical-debunking took place (ala Snopes) and now, we have &#39;official&#39; facts. Anyone who&#39;s not in the special club doesn&#39;t get to approve (or disprove) facts. </p>

<p>Your definition of &quot;debunked&quot; may be a VERY different that mine.

If you&#39;re obstructing the public quest for truth (in ANY way) then you&#39;re part of the problem too. The only way to debunk something is to do a thorough investigation -- the kind journalists used to do before they were bought and paid for by Corporations.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>JFK, Pizzagate, and Sandy Hook have been debunked --by the fact finders (investigators and conspiracy theorists). They&#39;ve debunked the &#39;official&#39; story and provided evidence of what really happened. The truth always has a way of coming out.</p>

<p>But flat earth is debunked. Accept it.</p>

<p>I never believed that to be a true &#39;conspiracy&#39; anyway. Kind of like Nibiru... </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Bravo. Thanks for the well written piece brother!</p>

<p>I&#39;ve been enjoying this sub for like six years and it&#39;s only gotten toxic in the last couple of months and we all know why, or at least where it&#39;s coming from. I hope you all can find a way to make it better and keep it a good place to speak freely. </p>

<p>I&#39;m a progressive who is very anti gov but shit it sucks to be getting so many death threats on this sub lately because I&#39;m also anti orange billionaires. Being told that trump dick riders are making a list and will track is down and kill us is lame. I&#39;m not scared at all and just reply with an invite over for beers as I know damn well these kids are all talk but it still is lame that it&#39;s gotten to this point. </p>

<p>Best of luck. </p>

<p>Shit is fucked up around here and while I don&#39;t care what happens on Reddit if it stays in Reddit, what we are trying to contain here is real world shit. I saw someone on this sub post dozens of people&#39;s personal instagram accounts here the other day just because they were in the same social media circles as a pizza shop owner in DC and made crude jokes. That shit is real world shit. Hell I had to defend some really good people who I know and have worked with just because they have a built a really popular restaurant and the clintons had pizza there. </p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>When it comes to Rule 10, it&#39;s a tricky one. There is a grey area.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Not really. If someone attacks an individual redditor or the sub as a whole then it violates the rule. Simple rubric.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>But I&#39;ve reported on others for personal attacks dozens of times, for MUCH worse stuff and they always seem to be ignored by the mods.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>From my perspective when I was modding, very few mods bothered to check the mod-queue and only responded to modmail reports. Even then, we&#39;re all just volunteers and can&#39;t be expected to catch every single instance of a personal attack. That said, the mod-log is public (if you don&#39;t care about browser security), and if you notice that someone engages in rule 10 and you report it, check back a while later to see if a mod <em>approved</em> the violation. Then you&#39;ll have something to show. Sadly a <em>lot</em> of mods disregard the rules when they agree with the person who violates them.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>...there is a lot of money made because of this sub.</p>

<p>I think the mods need to go on record whether or not they maintain a financial incentive to push any conspiracy theories (do they have an adsense account) and if so, step-down. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>AFAIK there is no mod that has any monitary conflicts of interest. An ex-mod Orangutan was even de-modded a couple years back because it was discovered that he was posting links to something that he had investments in.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I&#39;m not a fan of rules 2</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Me neither. I think too few people are aware of the rules in the first place and allowing users to discuss and point out violations in comments would help fix that situation. I don&#39;t see the reasoning behind rule 2.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>...and 9.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Rule 9 is mostly for banning people who link <em>here</em> from brigade subs like TMoR or SRD. Usually they are already banned for rule 10.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Any actual attempts at brigading should be covered under existing site-wide reddit rules and is redundant here. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>That would be nice if it were true. Admins rarely take the time to discipline brigaders who aim here.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It makes no sense to me that flat-Earth conspiracies are tolerated in this sub. Enough evidence has been provided to establish this conspiracy theory as busted.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This sub is about conspiracy theories, no matter how inane or unbelievable or how well debunked. If the poster wants to discuss the theory of Flat Earth then they can here. We shouldn&#39;t ban/forbid <em>any</em> subject matter no matter how absurd. What should be banned/forbidden (and technically is via rule 11 which is ignored by the mods) is to make blanket assertions in post titles and misrepresent theory or opinion as fact. Simple semantics. Mods don&#39;t care about that since the Trump kids flooded in though. Lies are welcomed with open arms, as the front page is a testament to <em>right now</em>. </p>

<p>Everything else you say I agree with. But if you don&#39;t send this comment to mods via the modmail link then you&#39;re wasting your time. They won&#39;t read it here. </p>

<p>Not true. Rule 6 was changed unilaterally (presumably to avoid having to discipline the rogue/incompetent mods who undermined it). You might recall that it was directly contradictory at one point during this transition.</p>

<p>I disagree. There was no vote, just a thread where the underminers were whinging and frothing and <em>I</em> fixed the contradiction to make the new rule 6 express what the unilateral changer intended it to say. There was never a vote. </p>

<p>There <em>was</em> a vote, unanimous in favor (except for one mod who basically called me a &#39;retard&#39; in the thread, you know which one), that no mod can approve a rule violating post. Remember that? Voting is a <em>fucking joke</em>. The rogue mods blatantly ignored that unanimous vote.</p>
