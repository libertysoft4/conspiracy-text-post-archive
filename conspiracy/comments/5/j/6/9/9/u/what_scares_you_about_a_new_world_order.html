<p>Are they corrupt sadistic psychopaths looking out for only their own? Then no that&#39;s no good </p>

<p>I think the US could be a true utopia at this point in time, but our capitalist system has been corrupted, taken advantage of, and needs to completely be rethought. Instead of progress and growth, it&#39;s maintaining the status quo and maximizing profits, enriching a very privileged few. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I wasn&#39;t too familiar with that publication I&#39;m afraid, I was just going by the more &quot;mainstream&quot; view of the NWO.</p>

<p>When you label it as &quot;world wide fascism with no possible route of escape&quot; then it does sound slightly more insidious than the concept I&#39;ve envisioned. </p>

<p>Until substantial proof is discovered, it is open to interpretation anyway.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It will be.  I&#39;m not assuming. </p>

<p>Their plan is out in the open at the link provided.</p>

<p>The speech is understated because a full voiced announcement of their goals is explicitly treason. After saying sovereignty is old hat because &#39;other actors&#39; (the CFR for instance)  are  a threat that cannot be beaten by sovereign entities.</p>

<p>Hidden inside the TPP was a tipoff  their goal  to have corporations be international powers that could sue governments that did anything to reduce the corporations Potential profits that would relegate governments such as our own secondary to the international power of the corporations and leave the US government as a local jurisdiction. </p>

<p>If you don&#39;t fear the greed of the psychopaths who lead us I can&#39;t help you.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>As a result, new mechanisms are needed for regional and global governance that include actors other than states. This is not to argue that Microsoft, Amnesty International, or Goldman Sachs be given seats in the United Nations General Assembly, but it does mean including representatives of such organisations in regional and global deliberations when they have the capacity to affect whether and how regional and global challenges are met.</p>
