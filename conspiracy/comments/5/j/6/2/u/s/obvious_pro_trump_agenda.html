<p>come on! is that a joke? i&#39;m not HRC fan, but this sub has been completely ignoring the huge amount of shady shit from Trump&#39;s past..not to mention it won&#39;t even fucking consider the weird shit going on with Russia. ya&#39;ll need to take your Trump blinders off. seriously...i&#39;m disturbed that so many people seem under Trump&#39;s spell.</p>

<p>yep, reddit trying to deal with T_d was a lose-lose situation, yea they finally solved the brigading issues, but now the cult has bled over to fringe subs and essentially claimed ownership, its ridiculous how in /conspiracy we can only have discussions which they personally approve of or agree with, otherwise we face being down voted into oblivion..... even this post is already being derailed </p>

<p>but since this is /conspiracy and we like to openly discuss all kinds of crazy theories, ill throw my 2-cents in </p>

<p><em>&quot;Russian trolls? that&#39;s dumb only the CIA or Clinton has armies of paid trolls, no one else in whole wide world is capable of doing that&quot;</em>
(except of course the people they selective accuse of that exact thing right? if you google paid trump trolls you&#39;ll find way more about this also):</p>

<p><em>&quot;yea right shill, what even makes you think that is true?&quot;</em> 
well i think stuff like this is interesting......</p>

<p><em>&quot;but what about CTR, at least trump isn&#39;t paying for his online presence......&quot;</em>
-except for the $15m he has paid to 3 different agencies to manage his <em>&quot;digital outreach&quot;</em></p>

</ul>

<p>i know that, since we are in the middle of a hostile takeover, i should expect to be told i&#39;m retarded or a shill or CTR or some other nonsense and that none of this matters, it&#39;s all fake blah blah blah, i&#39;m being gas-lighted by fake MSM- i should read more russia-insider, i was even told i was CIA in another post...  but at the end of the day, all this is, is an interesting <strong>CONSPIRACY</strong> theory on r/conspiracy (where we discuss these things) that maybe we are being brigaded by paid trump supporters or that we are being used as a propaganda machine?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No don&#39;t twist my words. I read some of your comments. They are disturbing to say the least. And yes you did say people need to be killed. And I proved it already. And honestly, you are also extremely racist. </p>

<p>Another one of your comments ex:blacks do quite frequently have my more children than they can afford.</p>

<p>You actually came on this sub and started calling people dumb who don&#39;t agree with your opinions. You think you are open minded but you are not when you make comments like that. Go back to playing with your chaos magic and insulting people. Maybe you were not such a mean person and insulting maybe they would take you seriously. But you can&#39;t be. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The only thing you proved is that you have poor reading comprehension. The whole point of that thread was if you HAD to reduce the population, what would be the criteria. It&#39;s a huge leap to claim that I said we NEED to start offing people. I have plenty of black friends. I also know plenty of white people who can&#39;t afford kids. However, in my area, the poorest most corrupt town on Long Island, yea it is largely the blacks having too many kids on welfare. Making an observation =\= racism. And the whole point of this forum is to get people to open their eyes, I&#39;d you&#39;re gonna get Butthurt because I pointed out a way that I feel many are failing to do so, then so be it. You really have a way with twisting words and making hyperboles, I&#39;ll give you that.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I never said anyone needed to be killed, the entire point of that thread is based on a hypothetical situation. Look up hypothetical, that might clarify. And any girl I sleep with, I make very clear that were not having kids, so yeah if she tries to have my offspring without my consent I&#39;m gonna do something about it. Now please remind me how any of this is in any way relevant? Oh wait, you just came here to derail this, I forgot.</p>
