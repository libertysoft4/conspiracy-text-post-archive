Am I the only one who feels like Trump winning the nomination pretty much throws a wet towel over a majority of them, especially the ones that are large in scale? I&#39;m sorry but if something 1/10th as powerful as the Illuminati existed they would have been able to rig the election with ease. What am I missing here?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>imo both are zionist puppets, trump had a meeting with head of mossad like two days ago and said they discussed syrian civil war(which means the whole friends with putin fighting isis narrative likely down the drain), numerous ties to israel most rather explicit, one of main campaign points was iran nuclear deal, general mattis has a hard on for iran as well. i have a more specific theory as to what&#39;s going on but this somewhat gets at it minus strategy.</p>

<p>also may be a little tinfoil but that whole simpsons prediction with the escalator announcement, matt groening is tied to epstein i do believe</p>

<p>i think under trump we&#39;ll likely fuck up the middle east for the benefit of israel, iran the primary one on the shitlist, and with russia and iran getting friendly, well, should be some crazy shot however it unfolds</p>

    <div class="md"><p>but yeah if anything we do get a wall and the likes, infrastructure, etc. reminds me of hitler&#39;s rise with the infrastructure/military buildup(not in a bad way, currently reading mein kampf). my theory honestly goes pretty tinfoil, trump being a zionist puppet using hitleresque very effective nationalism and will manifest in destroying islamic countries that benefit israel, trump&#39;s good friend netanyahu and the likes were likely behind 9/11 which escalated islamic tensions initially</p>

    <div class="md"><p>hitler building up his military and creating jobs via infrastructure wasn&#39;t based on hate for jews, it was to revive the economy, to keep it short. i touched on how they ended up losing ww1 via zionists getting america involved in the war, prior to that in 1916 not a foot had tramped on german soil and they would&#39;ve obviously won, they offered essentially a reset to prewar conditions to britain. the versailles treaty was an utter raping of germany and hitler&#39;s role was natural, if they obeyed the rules of the treaty they would&#39;ve been slowly destroyed via bad economy and no military. i said not in a bad way to say that i&#39;m not trying to demonize the economics of it or else you would assume i&#39;m comparing trump to hitler through the lens of the average person who starts to feel guilty if you even mention anything against the narrative of the nazis solely being a product of some demonic amoral one nutted lunatic screaming in german.</p>

On paper he&#39;s someone who she should easily beat, and if he ever picked up steam they would sink him with scandals.</p>

<p>But somewhere along the way Trump broke the script and decided he really wanted to win and out-campaigned her, out-rallied her, and somehow became the more likeable candidate and won fair and square. Thus why the MSM all got it so wrong: they were probably assured all the way back from the primary that Clinton had it in the bag, so that was their narrative all year.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah I freaked out when that happened. There&#39;s no way that was a coincidence. Look at the history of that account. Inactive for a year and then they post about Fred Trump and Tesla. They were referencing this meme: <a href="http://imgur.com/EVdeMRP?r">http://imgur.com/EVdeMRP?r</a></p>

<p>And then Nov 1 posting about the foundation, just like he was saying in the threads.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The powers that be don&#39;t care if there was a gorilla in the White House. Only if the gorilla causes them trouble do they resort to either a Carter derailment or a Kennedy assassination.</p>

<p>The 1% already own the majority of the Congressmen and Senators by funding their multi million dollar election campaigns for a job whose salary starts at $174,000 per annum. Democrat or Republican doesn&#39;t matter.</p>

<p>The 1% own the Secretaries, the senior Bureaucrats, and military brass by the fact that after retirement they will put THESE RETIRED PUBLIC SERVANTS either on the board of their companies or as an advisor to board earning multimillion $$$ salaries.</p>

<p>The 1% own the Fed and therefore  control credit.</p>

<p>The 1% now own private companies contracted to NSA, CIA, etc.. whom deal in the surveillance of U.S. citizens (Edward Snowdon worked for one) giving them access to the greatest database in history with the ability to locate and silence anyone, their family, and friends. </p>

<p>They have already rattled Trump&#39;s cage over the electors college and now have Obama digging a hole for him over Russia. Trump has appointed former Rothschild &amp; Co in his cabinet which is an ill wind for the future. Indeed bar his stance against regime change, many of his policies will echo that of Clinton/Bush/Obama. As for free trade Trump never said he was against it just that he would renegotiate.</p>

<p>However should Trump cause problems for the PTB and it comes down to the worse scenario, they have Pence ready to move in.</p>

<p>Sorry for editing but the phone i am using is junk</p>

    <div class="md"><p>but yeah if anything we do get a wall and the likes, infrastructure, etc. reminds me of hitler&#39;s rise with the infrastructure/military buildup(not in a bad way, currently reading mein kampf). my theory honestly goes pretty tinfoil, trump being a zionist puppet using hitleresque very effective nationalism and will manifest in destroying islamic countries that benefit israel, trump&#39;s good friend netanyahu and the likes were likely behind 9/11 which escalated islamic tensions initially</p>
