<p>No you don&#39;t. The below will show why. </p>

<p>The ruffling of his shirt appears to be some sort of small explosive charge, evidenced by it being a flash of light</p>

<p>If it&#39;s a flash of light, why isn&#39;t it brighter than the light reflecting off of his forehead? </p>

<blockquote>
<p>The actor also flinches in a way that indicates he knew it was coming.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>How does his flinch look any different than how someone would flinch that got shot or head a loud noise right behind them? </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Ballistics expert has told me these rounds sound like BLANKS. There are also no sounds of shell casings hitting the floor</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Does your ballistics expert know that blank rounds have casings? </p>

<blockquote>
<p>There is also no sound of the bullets hitting him.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Why would there be? The gunshot would overwhelm any squelching of flesh being torn. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Most importantly, THERE IS NO BLOOD COMING FROM THE AMBASSADOR&#39;S BODY?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>OMG thank you. I saw the small puddle under his head (at least that&#39;s what I think it is) and the thing about there not being casings from blanks? XD 
And the shot didn&#39;t make a sound when it hit his body? Someone has been playing to much Cod. I kiiiinda thought it might be fake first because it looks too good. He&#39;s got the filming angles, he&#39;s got the poses and he&#39;s standing behind him, how the fuck did a man like that end up standing behind a high up person, I heard he&#39;s am off duty officer but that&#39;s exactly what&#39;s wrong, off duty. The collar getting flicked up looks fake  not because it looks mechanical buy because since its such a bright shirt there should be some trace of blood since the bullet came out. The assassin getting shot looks kinda bad to because there&#39;s bullet holes EVERYWHERE I&#39;d expect more precision but then also it&#39;s and extremely heated hostage situation with a person already being killed.</p>

<p>But since its probably not fake, staged I do believe but not fake where going to see shit go down maybe.</p>

<p>Ambassador gets shot 9/10 times, no blood. </p>

<p><a href="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/C0D4G61W8AA_adx.jpg">Assassin gets shot</a>, blood everywhere? Also, I cannot find any other photos/video of assassin getting shot. Why not? The cameras were already there and in place. </p>

</ul>

<blockquote>
<p>It&#39;s blown open by the force of the bullet hitting his body.. Not some wind/gas.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>there has to be some blood in the front of his shirt, because of the exit wound. If the shirt wasn&#39;t blown open/puffed up because of the bullet, what caused it? </p>

<ul>
<li></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
<p>According to witness at the site, the gunman suddenly rushed behind Karlov and shot, then Karlov fell to the ground. The gunman also shot at spectators at the site, according to a witness.</p>

<p>“He (the gunman) firstly pointed his gun to the ambassador, then turned his gun to us. We lay prone on the ground because of panic. I saw the gunman pointed his gun to the ceiling, and the ambassador fell down,” said a witness. <a href="http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/live-russian-ambassador-shot-dead-9486164">Source</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>The <a href="http://www.trbimg.com/img-58583691/turbine/chi-ambassador-assassination-wre0045340148-20161219">expressions</a> on their faces reminds me of other false flags. Some are not even looking at the gunman, and some look bored. </p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://i.imgur.com/UJprFOG.jpg">This photo</a> (credit u/teslasmuse). Is this how you would behave if there was a gunman/assassin (who just killed someone) behind you? They look like they just got out of a boring work meeting while the shooter is still talking behind them AFTER KILLING SOMEONE.</li>

Doesn&#39;t it fucking suck being POOR? It really limits your ability to do research so you end up spreading misinformation and looking like a goddamned fucking lightweight amateur.</p>

 It doesn&#39;t pass the eye test, this looks like a television production from the way the body falls to the way the alleged gunman holds his gun and gestures, etc.  

 It looks like a scene from a spy movie.  The terrorist moves like he has been rehearsing for the lead in a musical all month. 

 It&#39;s all a little too perfect, they haul the ambassador away in an ambulance and after a staged shootout (again, no blood) then they do the same with the gunman.

  Mission accomplished.  Even 911 did not have as perfect a video as this. I smell a rat with a Russian accent.

  &quot;If it seems too good to be true, it probably is.&quot;

After being shot from behind consecutively with 9 bullets? Wouldn&#39;t the Ambassador be pushed forwards or to the right/his left? Am I wrong in expecting the force of 9 bullets in a row at point blank range would thrust him forwards and knocking over the podium? In the video it looks like he falls straight down and back somehow with all limbs stretched out. Looks very wrong to me. Also you can see his glasses on the floor behind the Ambassador somehow in one of the photos? How does this happen? </p>

<p>Why is there no video of the assassin getting shot? Obviously the camera was still recording as he was shouting. So did someone switch off the camera and then shoot the gunman? If so, why?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It is a weird set up but let&#39;s look at both sides: </p>

<p>For: 
* Camera set up, especially the one next to him. 
* Lack of blood anywhere to be seen 
* The room itself is &quot;awkward&quot; or not very convincing. 
* The flinching of that one guy
* No blood absorbed to be seen on white shirt 
* No other public photos or video of the deceased (not really too suspicious) 
* Very clean kill 
* Very clean everything!
*The odd fall and the jumping of the collar </p>

<p>Against: 
* No movement of the shot (who&#39;s weight would be a strain)
* The shot individual is not an actor
* Weight can absorb small bullets</p>

<p>Now I personally think he is dead, but he was set up to die, meaning the entire things feels and is awkward because it was a set up not by just the shooter to kill the ambassador but others who support the shooters agenda. It was very clean, documented and a professional assassination which involved multiple individuals. </p>

<p>The collar thing I think is due to the shirt being pulled by one of the bullets. </p>

<p>If he didn&#39;t die and was able to not move like that with that weight, props! Though the dark shadow under his head does appear to be something like fresh blood. </p>

<p>Either way, I think multiple people were involved and that also explains why the gun man was able to even to give their message. The shooter was a scale goat for some agenda. </p>

<p>Well planned assassination with the area, timing etc. not just some cop could have killed him in this fashion. Almost... Artistic.... Which is ironic with it being done in a gallery... Or intential... </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Even I thought this entire scandal seemed a bit off, and hence got to this post by googling &quot;was the assassination fake&quot;. Another thing I noticed was that he seemed to hold his stomach/abdomen while he was shot, even though he was being shot at from behind (with no visible exit wound). Also, if someone shoots me on the back, I think I would fall on my face, rather than on my back. Thoughts?</p>

Situation about assassin:
His legs are shot couple of times by the police to get him alive but he insisted on fighting. When he tried to get something from his pocket police though of explodes and killed him. That was probably the magazine and it was shot also.</p>
