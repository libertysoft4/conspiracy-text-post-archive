<p>Note I considered Dec 24th originally, however the sun isn&#39;t in position for this, and the 5-5.5&#39;s range / magnitude quakes in the following weeks, I expect will be for-shocks to the current situation unfolding on the Solar disk. </p>

<p>To expand on that, there is a current flare exhibiting a moderate amount of activity at this time. (present time), however were in 600&#39;s / low 700&#39;s, km/s (Solar wind speeds). </p>

<p>This was expected in what I call a holding pattern, and these sunspots are grazing now into / with the suns geo-effective coronal holes. <a href="http://sdo.gsfc.nasa.gov/assets/img/latest/latest_1024_0131.jpg">(beginning to flare current date).</a> </p>

<p>When the magnetic&#39;s from the coronal holes dissipate into the solar lens, it will add fuel to the fire. (After 2 weeks time), when the sunspots themselves return, id expect the now negative polarities of the existing coronal holes to add &quot;fuel to the fire&quot; in reference to the current sunspot region 47 on the solar lens. </p>

<p><a href="http://sdo.gsfc.nasa.gov/assets/img/latest/latest_1024_0131.jpg">Essentially if you look at the angstroms diagram.</a></p>

<p>There is a bright spot. (i.e. sunspot). This is typical and again, creating today&#39;s heightened <a href="http://www.hamqsl.com/solarcycle24.php?heline=eve">solar wind speeds.</a> 
(579 at time of post respectively)... <a href="http://earthquaketrack.com/quakes/2016-12-21-16-43-58-utc-5-9-16">which also lead to the increased earthquake activity in the mariana islands today.</a></p>

<p><strong>However:</strong>
In two weeks time that sunspot will cool and recede into the dark area (coronal hole)I.e. <a href="http://services.swpc.noaa.gov/images/synoptic-map.jpg">reigon 47</a> 
, <a href="http://solarham.net/regions/map2.htm">2</a></p>

<p>The combining magnetic&#39;s will likely lead to associated bursting in solar winds, which will then rock our planet into near 850-950 km&#39;s solarwind range. (creating the seismic energy needed for the above predicted 8.0+ range Earthquake I&#39;ve predicted (weeks ago). </p>

<p>But, what do I know-</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I believe California may see some associated 5.0 scale events following shortly after the initial quake series that will occur in Japan come January. (in terms of seismic activity). Should the event be a near 9.0 magnitude these could be as high as 6.5 range. However California&#39;s recent seismic episode should have stabilized the plate from large scale EQ&#39;s until march; When I see a 7.5 quake will promptly take place. </p>

<p>In terms of tsunamis; for your region (Which I presume is why you are asking). I am expecting nothing more then rouge waves, and maybe 2 inch tide breaks for the January / Japan quake series. </p>

<p>However one thing to consider in this is the Godzilla submarine volcanic chambers, which could likely situate into a small series of 3.5 - 4.4 range Earthquakes throughout the January events. </p>

<p>Essentially, there will be a &quot;feeling&quot; of tensions in the area at that time, with the rumbling, but past earthquake records show that your largest events are harbored between Mar 10 - April 10. And June 16th - June 28th. As well as August 1st. - August 18th. </p>

<p>So if we took historical records into context. You will be rumbling, in January. Yet in march, i&#39;d be in a heightened state of alert, in comparison to large scale, Juan de fuca, and san andreas events. Respectively. </p>

<p>Note solar winds are in position to charge the earths magnetic core with radiant energy that will massively dominate the seismic wave frequencies here on earth. Essentially buckle up your seatbelts. NZ will likely have a swarming of mediocre events; But Japan is about to get a bell ringer; The largest EQ since 3/11/2011 Mark my words-</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If it makes you feel better is should be a smaller event then 3/11;</p>

<p>Big. But not as big. Which should say that the more we weigh into this science the more it will help in the future. (That&#39;s why I write these updates). Note I actually have talked to the author of this video (Dutchsince). He is a cool guy. I suggest you follow him as well. 
Maybe someday me and him could collaborate more. I&#39;d like that. 
Until then, just know people care and are attempting to make a difference; and that should give you a reason to turn that frown upside down :)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There are a lot of people out there who &quot;predict&quot; EQs but actually are just fearmongers with nothing to back it up. It&#39;s a particularly sore point in NZ after the Canterbury EQs, when some people were making some extremely fantastical claims and terrifying people. Your research is actually backed by scientific theories that already exist and you definitely don&#39;t &quot;report&quot; in a fearful way which I really appreciate, so thank you for your work!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ty!!!!! </p>

<p>I have to say that the current users that do it seem to have fallen off the collaborative research perspectives, and are quite full of themselves. I don&#39;t think I will ever make a dime; Maybe its best I haven&#39;t because money clouds your vision? </p>

<p>Essentially I&#39;ve literally done solar obsevation for nearly 6 years now; I&#39;d even go as far as saying that I am slightly an original in the extent of meriting these concepts into a workable algorithm. </p>

<p>But I feel like my earlier work was cherry picked, and used by these others whom literally made a killing in profits; I just want to change the world and make it a better place. If anything I do it for my daughter. While I am a poor man, I want to leave her an example of what you can truly do with your time; </p>

<p>I mostly make this public again cause my situation probably will never allow me to forward it much. So I am hopeful it is of some use to the future generations making strides at completing where and when I myself will leave this world; </p>

<p>Someday it may really help to prove the connection that I fell is valid; and of all things that is exactly what compels me to move forward. So Ty sincerely for taking me for what I am. </p>

<p>No fear mongering here. Just a guy that gets a kick outta science, and feels everyone should play their part in it; </p>

<p>Ironically what got me into space was the study of time travel and ufo&#39;s. lol that was me as a kid; More excited about the unknown than the most popular brands of shoes and jacket. </p>

<p>Now I am just a 32 something online poster that is trying to make since of it all :)</p>

<p>Thanks again sir or mam; I can see your humble and have been through alot; So I apologize for the sensationalism of others. </p>

<p>Rest assured regardless of others; I just want to say; Hey look lol. 
Other then that; I suppose its the future of the results I hope at some point I can sign my name to. To make my family proud of the things I attempted to solve in my limited time here on earth. </p>

<p>People like you help me stay motivated; So again. Ty So much. </p>

<p>It makes every bit of the difference!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh lol. I already addressed the rising activity in this thread. </p>

<p>But He can confirm the updated elevation in 6.0 range. This is due to the sunspot region 48 having compacted beautifully, in the last weeks time. We should see highly elevated solar winds with associated g5 solar storming. High latitude observers will likely see some beautiful peeks at the solar lights this week. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I just hope people will consider to donate if a tsunami impacts the nation. Try to research the areas of impact and who your donating too. (Maybe see what companies helped in the march 2011 incident) use it as a working model. This may be larger than I myself am anticipating. Note that I am going off the data I have on person. 
So When I say I expect a tsunami. I mean it; Fully. </p>

<p>Not a huge omg one. but one that may lead to loss of life; So Lets just hope that the gods are fair to the nation. :)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think we&#39;ll be lucky if the whole Universe doesn&#39;t fly out from under our shoes this time.  You know how if you&#39;re an older person you remember times when all seemed lost and the government had gone insane and there was so much war and suffering in the world you couldn&#39;t stand it but life still went on?  I think everyone can agree that this time feels different.  I just &quot;have a bad feeling&quot; all the time, and I know how self-reinforcing that can be.  People like Abramovic and Podesta operate in the open now.  I don&#39;t know how to take that.  Do they know their time is coming so they have no shame, or is it a final blowout before the end?  I imagine God has already sorted this out in earthquake form.    </p>
