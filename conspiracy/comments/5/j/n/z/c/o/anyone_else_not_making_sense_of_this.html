    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s a woman that was standing in the towers when it was supposedly hot enough to melt steel(&lt;~1700C). Where she was standing her skin would have literally ignited, and she would have been a human torch. Much less would she have been able to lean against any steel without excruciating pain.</p>

<p>In other words it&#39;s just more proof that they lied about the cause of the collapse.</p>

I expect that your factory has safety measures to ensure that all employees near heat sources are kept to a measurably safe level with various safety equipment.

    <div class="md"><p>There&#39;s a pretty big difference here.</p>

<p>The difference is that supposedly a large fire caused the heat that somehow melted steel, and not propane or whatever contained heat source they use in a foundry.</p>

<p>Source: Cast my own metal before, didn&#39;t die. Stood 30 feet away from a bonfire, felt like I was melting.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I figured in the recent Berlin truck case that the suspect was just dropping a fake ID that obviously wasn&#39;t useful anymore. That might also tie into how the police wound up arresting the wrong person in this case. It makes sense that a terrorist would steal someone&#39;s ID, use it to cover their own identity, and then make the getaway with their true identity undetected. </p>

<p>Now, I wonder if the guys who did 9/11 were using fake IDs, and wither we identified their real identities... </p>

<p>Spez: GODDAMIT!!! Why do I always find the typos long after I&#39;ve posted! If anyone dinds more typos, please point them out. I&#39;m really trying to improve on this matter. </p>
