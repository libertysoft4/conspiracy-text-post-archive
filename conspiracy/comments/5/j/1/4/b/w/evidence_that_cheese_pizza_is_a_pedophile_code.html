<p>Photos of &quot;cheese pizza&quot; were used on 4chan to solicit, tongue-in-cheek, &quot;C&quot;hild &quot;P&quot;orn, to taunt 4chan mods since a photo of pizza does not justify banning.  Actual child porn on 4chan does justify banning, however, and so &quot;Cheese Pizza&quot; was not actually code for Child Porn, but a &quot;Fuck You Mods&quot; taunt.</p>

<p>The rest of Wyand&#39;s code is fully invented as far as anybody has shown, and nobody is showing pre-existing examples of such code words as &quot;walnut sauce&quot; or &quot;pasta&quot;, etc., being used to prove the validity of the code and thereby the validity of the claims.</p>

<p>The self-description of Wyand is telltale, though.</p>

<p>We live in a nation with Secret Police.  There is no such thing as &quot;one of us&quot;.  Especially online.  Even more dangerously, on &quot;Reddit&quot;.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I posted about Wyand earlier in Pizzagate hysteria, but there&#39;s no point on a website where any police agency or private enterprise can simply flood Reddit with unlimited numbers of fake accounts to manipulate &quot;consensus&quot;.</p>

<p>There are many possibilities to Pizzagate that have not even been mentioned.</p>

<p>Pizzagaters couldn&#39;t care less about child victims if they don&#39;t care about such proof as whether the alleged &quot;code words&quot; were accurate.  Or Pizzagaters don&#39;t really believe in catching criminals since they are so casual and flippant about keeping evidence untainted.  Why wouldn&#39;t a real Pizzagate pedo join Reddit &amp; drop new &quot;code words&quot; into the mix to destroy all credibility?</p>

<p>Pizzagaters don&#39;t give a fuck.  Or should I say &quot;so-called Pizzagaters&quot; since it&#39;s also an effective intel trick to infiltrate, and pose as, a Pizzagater whose standard of evidence is what his dog told him.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It is slang from a subculture. I agree with your point that it is not universal. Slang is variable based on time, location and networks within the wider subculture. </p>

<p>Concerning the Podesta emails I see two issues. First would be is there evidence that slang is utilized.  The second whether it is consistent with what is found in pedophilia subcultures.  </p>

<p>I think the answer to the first point is yes. </p>

<p>I am agnostic to the answer to the second point.  However, there is enough circumstantial evidence to be suspicious. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Keep in mind that pedophiles have been around and using code words for longer than any of the chans, longer than the Internet, and longer than computers. There&#39;s going to be &quot;traditional&quot; pedocode mixed in with newer &quot;chan&quot; pedocode.</p>

<p>&quot;Cheese&quot; has a better chance at being more &quot;traditional&quot; pedocode but I&#39;m pretty sure 4chan invented &quot;Cheese Pizza&quot; on their own. For one, cheese doesn&#39;t mean the same thing.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m a paedophile and I&#39;ve never seen &quot;pizza&quot; as codeword before t_D inventing a lot of shit and use those to connect shit to create a conspiracy theory.</p>

<p>None of my pedo friends has ever seen it used either.</p>

<p>There is a code word that I think originated from imageboards like 4chan, &quot;cheese pizza&quot;, which stands for &quot;child pornography&quot;. Child pornography -&gt; cp -&gt; cheese pizza.</p>

<p>You guys are idiots.</p>

<p>I bet you guys don&#39;t even know what sink threads were really for.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The term didn&#39;t come from pedos talking in code. That&#39;s what people don&#39;t get. It started being a thing when a pedo on HTCAP actually offered the host a pizza to let him go. From there it became a meme and this was between 2004-2007 when the show was in syndication. I posted the video a couple of weeks back but Google can help you find it. Is it being used for CP now? Yes, due to it becoming a meme. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>No that&#39;s not correct. Code words are used to avoid prosecution. No one uses code words the police know. Cheese pizza has nothing whatsoever to do with children and there is no proof it did. It&#39;s an absurd speculation from people who don&#39;t leave their parent&#39;s basements. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Code words are used to relay information. Some of their effects are to avoid prosecution.    Concerning your second proposition, its false in a trivial manner. Lots of people use code words that are familiar to the police. The question is this; Is asking for child porn on line enough to constitute probable cause? How about asking for cheese pizza 9-10 slices? What is easier to establish from a judicial perspective? </p>

<p>You state there is no proof that Cheese Pizza has anything to do with children.  Proof belongs in the realm of deductive sciences and the courts. However, evidence that supports a premise adds justification to our inferences. There is evidence provided that Cheese Pizza stands for child porn and child porn has a lot to do with children.   </p>
