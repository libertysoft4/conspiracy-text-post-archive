    <div class="md"><p>Do you have a link to this FBI documented code, from an official source?  The only thing I&#39;ve seen about this code is from an anonymous post on 4chan where someone tells people to look for certain code words without actually explaining where the code words came from.  So if you have a link to a verified FBI document I&#39;d love to see it.</p>

<p>As for the cheese or pasta email, there&#39;s nothing weird about it beyond it being a little overly dramatic.  Playing dominos on pasta or cheese is obviously a joke on the level of a crappy dad joke, wondering if they&#39;ll do better at the game after eating pasta or cheese.  That is an incredibly weak example, and requires a bit of stretching or lack of reading comprehension to make it fit some nefarious agenda.  I&#39;m a skeptic, and this whole thing is more flimsy than a wet tissue.</p>

<p>Out of all the emails I&#39;ve seen relating to this there is one that stands out. Even if you wish to believe it has nothing to do with pedophilia it is still disturbing.</p>

<p>Using unaccounted tax payer money for private parties, no thanks. Flying in pizza/dogs from Chicago, even though <em>no food can be brought into the WH from elsewhere</em> is suspicious. </p>

<p>What channels are they referring to? Why put quotes around the word waitresses?  This email stinks to high heaven. </p>

<p>There isn&#39;t necessarily a connection. It&#39;s just Stratfor people using their Stratfor emails to talk about this.</p>

<p>As for the hot dogs, it wouldn&#39;t be out of character for Obama to want Chicago hot dogs for a party.  The outside food thing is interesting, but they do have to bring food into the White House somehow so it&#39;s possible it was a special order and/or for some kind of official gathering.  The timing of that email was around Obama&#39;s inauguration wasn&#39;t it?  Sounds like a celebratory party possibly.</p>

<p>All the food is purchased from the exec chef through secret sources, and must be cooked in house. They can&#39;t just &quot;fly in&quot; food from Chicago (or anywhere) for anything. It&#39;s a security/safety issue. </p>

<p>True, but still there&#39;s the matter of using unaccounted tax dollars. </p>

<p>And Chicago deep dish pizza is a big deal too, so it also fits the party theme. </p>

<p>I would guess, from the emails there, that at some point they&#39;d had &quot;hot dog Friday&quot; (however they defined it) before, and decided this time, they actually wanted food from Chicago brought in, as they&#39;d heard Obama had done, and they could talk to whoever hooked that up to get the food (the channels).</p>

<p>But...I think in their last &quot;hot dog event&quot; the waitresses they hired were models and/or hookers, really. Which doesn&#39;t connect at all to Obama&#39;s party. I think the hot dog importation is just food, while the hookers are separate issue related to a separate event in the group&#39;s past. No pedo-ness necessarily involved at all.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t really know if you people are really shills, brainwashed, or simply won&#39;t accept the uncomfortable facts. But I&#39;ll tell you one thing -- we&#39;ll keep posting about this forever. This will <em>not</em> be buried. We&#39;ll keep shoving those pictures in your face until you open your eyes. You can ban us, threaten us, call us crazies -- but this will not stop us.</p>
