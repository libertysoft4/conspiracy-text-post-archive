<p>We lost some major players when reddit did some maneuvers over the summer. And many to Voat. Some are over in CST or more niche or private subs, I think. </p>

<p>Idk, I need to take a break from here for a bit. All this Pizzagate bullshit is both annoying me, but also triggering shit from my own childhood. I got friends dropping like flies from depression or addiction this holiday season and this place has become like some kind of toxic self-abuse ritual for myself.... goddammit. Imma go eat carbs and Netflix. </p>

<p>Of course, the EC votes tomorrow and I will be here with popcorn....</p>

<p>This sub got taken over by the alt right white supremacists about eight months ago, at the least! I used to come here and read posts about GMO, bankers, and the surveillance state. </p>

<p>Then it suddenly turned into &quot;HITLERY IS LITERALLY CONTROLLING EVERYTHING.&quot; And watch what happens when a post mentions crime or drug use. All the &quot;race realists&quot; come out of the fucking woodwork. I&#39;ll probably get banned for saying this, but dissent isn&#39;t allowed in a fascist state. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I understand that since the election, this sub has been inundated with folks from T_D. I disagree that it was &quot;taken over&quot; by the &quot;alt right&quot; then or now. Disclaimer: not a Trump supporter.</p>

<p>You have to give some credit/blame in the uptick of anti Hillary posts during the election to jilted Bernie supporters. The leaks proved they got fucking railroaded so I don&#39;t blame them (I am one of them). Also, HRC is no stranger to scandals before this election. It was like tearing off a band-aid and dumping barrels of gas on the fire underneath that had been burning and smoldering on and off for years. She knew this. But her hubris tanked not only her, but the entire DNC. She took money that if used for the downticket races could have changed the legislative branch outcome. </p>

<p>The DNC got cocky and dug their own grave. I hope they never recover. I lean left. I will never vote Democrat again now that the curtain has been removed.</p>

<p>That being said. I have no problem with folks digging in <em>doing their due diligence</em>. If you like Trump? Fine. Don&#39;t let it cloud your judgement. Want to research something like pizzagate? Sure. But <em>do not</em> view it as a partisan issue. If you can&#39;t rationalize that Republicans, if it&#39;s true, are most likely fucking the same kids? Then you are nothing but a pawn and a useful idiot. The power struggle isn&#39;t &quot;left vs right&quot;. It is &quot;top vs bottom&quot;.</p>

<p>Sorry, this post got more intense than my intention. TLDR: Take down all the bad guys. There is no left or right. There is &quot;us and them&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Notice that the list of proven conspiracies include Hillary but not Donald.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not going to insult you in the form of a personal attack, but the reason is obvious.</p>

<p>Hillary is the epicenter of organized crime in America beginning with tainted prison blood, having her staff registered as Russian foreign agents while selling off US uranium to Russia and being directly tied to human trafficking in several nations for the purposes of forced labor (mining), organ trafficking  (Serbia), domestic and sexual servitude by Saudis by supporting their diplomatic immunity while enslaving women on US soil.</p>

<p>Name one thing about Trump that comes close to that?</p>

<p>Nevermind funding and arming ISIS.</p>

<p>Do you see the pattern? Create an enemy we all hate, build them up, and divert everyone&#39;s attention from the corruption.</p>

<p>And then, there is Pizzagate, which has successfully tied Saudi slave trading to Comet Ping Pong through Andrew J Kline.</p>

<p>These Saudis are selling white women on the Internet and, because you think the conflict is between Trump and Hillary, you fail to ask the obvious question...</p>

<p>Where are the Saudis getting the young white boys and girls to sell? And why is James Alefantis laundering their money through at least a dozen businesses?</p>

<p>So you think his cabinet picks are good???  I&#39;m confused, because I guarantee if hillary had been elected by the establishment, not by the people, and chosen the exact same cabinet that trump has, this sub would be flooded with angry threads about it daily.  But morons are fully brainwashed by the cult of dumbfuck donald that you excuse all his shitty choices.  It&#39;s disgusting.</p>

<p>Everyone would freak out if HRC was picking them cause it would be very uncharacteristic for <em>her</em> to do it. </p>

<p>Really? I think his choices were made based on who kissed his ass during the election, minus those who sensibly replied &quot;Hell no&quot; when they were offered a position.</p>
