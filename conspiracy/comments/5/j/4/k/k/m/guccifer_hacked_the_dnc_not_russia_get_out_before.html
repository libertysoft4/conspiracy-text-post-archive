        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>The HRC hack was really performed by Guccifer and Company (romanians). SURE NICE TRY MSM!</p>

<p>In May 2016—one month after being extradited to the U.S., and while jailed in Virginia awaiting trial—Guccifer claimed to have repeatedly hacked Hillary Clinton&#39;s email server. This claim occurred in the midst of an ongoing FBI probe of Clinton&#39;s use of a private email server while serving as United States Secretary of State.</p>

<p>Lehel claimed that the server was &quot;like an open orchid on the Internet&quot;[22] and that &quot;it was easy ... easy for me, for 
everybody.&quot;[12]</p>

<p>RIGHT FUCKING THERE!!!</p>

<p>Lehel provided no proof of his claim, and U.S. investigators found no evidence to support the claim.[23][24][25] U.S. officials have also said that if Lehel had obtained information from Clinton&#39;s servers, he would have publicly released such information, as he did when he obtained access to other high-profile individuals,[25] such as Sidney Blumenthal[26] and George W. Bush.[27]
Note this is the backdoor exploit they used on HRC who opened Guccifers email = LIES PROPAGANDA and that is the real truth.
The other &quot;leaker&quot; via the DNC PARTY was Seth Rich- Likely paid by Trump, and Killed by DNC- For treason within the party.</p>

<p>THIS IS THE EXPLOIT: On March 20, 2013, USA Today reported that Lehel had successfully hacked the e-mail account of Sidney Blumenthal, a former aide to former president Bill Clinton.[10] He distributed private memos from Blumenthal to Secretary of State Hillary Clinton involving recent events in Libya, including the September 11, 2012 Benghazi attack.[11] Before distributing the memos, he copied and pasted the text into his own new documents, then reformatted them with pink backgrounds and 
Comic Sans font.[11]</p>

<p>The hacker&#39;s IP address was traced to Russia, however there was no certainty as to whether this was his actual location or whether 
he had used a proxy to hide his true location.[12]
THE PROXY WAS RUSSIA. NOT THE USER. I&gt;E&gt; IT WAS GUCCIFER</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guccifer">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guccifer</a></p>

<p>THAT MEMO WAS A BACKDOOR. That is why it was coded dumb ass politicians are trying to blame Russia - To start a war. Because their own crimes are out-</p>

<p>Its already been confirmed. Dnc was a leak. Hrc was a Hack. THERE IS NO RU INVOLVEMENT!</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE</strong>
We didn&#39;t succeed. The following morning the RU ambassador was killed. Hmmm... </p>

<p>i think it&#39;s fairly common knowledge that guccifer was the one who publically recognized as &quot;the hacker&quot; of clinton&#39;s emails.</p>

<p>do we know if he is still alive, in fact ?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I am more concerned that this is the official narrative.</p>

<p>Starting tomorrow the US election will be swayed to HRC because the ELECTORAL college will use the RU hack - (Bogus claim) as a narrative to give HRC the Popular vote. </p>

<p>IMO assange was killed in october. 
This is the damage control plan. Fake the RU narrative. State RU helped Assange escape the Embassy. Call it a cordinated assault on western values. Begin War with RU. </p>

<p>This is the full narrative of tomorrows events. 
People need to know that the compromised hack was actually a leak, and the only person that could have confirmed that was JA. </p>

<p>Guccifer is in a hole - No clue if alive, (but where he is) I doubt he would want to be - </p>

No connections exist between the gru and guccifer. Mainly he was a paranoid nutter (consciously) and he would have outsmarted any agents attempting to affiliate with him. Paranoid&#39;s don&#39;t take on sabo&#39;s. He didn&#39;t need outside help because he was already capable. So throw the hammond motive out. </p>

<p>The main point is that there were several hackers there. That is basic of a majority which means that it was likelier that a USA state party was investigating HRC. Not RU. Russia wasn&#39;t even aware of the server until post guccifers takedown. (no one was). 
This would be more practical being both the illegality of the  situation as well as the Huma Abedin connection. </p>

<p>They likely are using the RU narrative to hide their own presence on the server in the first place. Not the other way around. As if russia had possessed the actual crimes they would have taken great pride and credit in releasing them via a state media channel. Putin has no problem embarrassing HRC. Think about it. 
If the NSA is pulling the strings, who do you think was inside HRC&#39;s computer. (Other magic hackers that have no papertrails (when guccifer was already caught). Or the Nsa. There is your answer. </p>

<p>So How would you explain that? </p>

<p>This is a last minute attempt to steal the election -
Nothing more and nothing less. There is and never was a conspiracy. </p>

<p>I know. Gucc2 is APT 29, and APT 28 is an otherwise unknown (apparently) Russian group/person, that could be GRU (or not.) APT 28 was present inside the DNC, as was APT 29 (Guccifer2).</p>

<p>I agree that APT 28 could be a false flag group, operating through .ru VPNs to indict Russia, but smarter people than me have implicated them as Russian.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t doubt that the NSA was inside as well.</p>

<p>To be clear: I&#39;m not sold on the Russia-got-Trump-elected story; I was clarifying that there was an (apparently) Russian presence inside the DNC (APT 28).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Based solely on proxy...</p>

<p>The real point is that they are an anon. Being the severity of the issues at hand, and the implications of the situation itself we should factually conclude that A. This anon is Either &quot;more powerful&quot; than the bulk of the NSA&#39;s reaching intelligence community. 
or was the community itself. </p>

<p>I think that being the severity of implicating their own agents in an undercover investigation of the DOJ; Would discredit the magnitude of the initial work ethic involving these parties. What I don&#39;t hear the media parading about is the more then obvious isis and muslim brotherhood connections within the white house itself at this time. 
Coincidence? or motive?</p>

<p>So To kill a mockingbird there is a coup; Or there isn&#39;t; I doubt there isn&#39;t one being that the NSA doesn&#39;t work for the WH. They work for the people. Hence their silence and otherwise undeniable knowledge to the integrity of the situation in the first place. </p>

<p>Essentially. They know, and they aren&#39;t talking. 
Sure it was russia lol. Think what ever you want to avoid seeing the real truth. Hiding in plain site or so they say. Factually its genius.</p>
