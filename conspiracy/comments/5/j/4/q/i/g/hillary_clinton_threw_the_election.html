        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Just wondering, because I haven&#39;t seen it discussed literally whatsoever. Is it at all possible that Hillary Clinton purposely threw this election? Before you dismiss, doesn&#39;t it seem odd that a career politician and so many people we thought were aligned with her, slipped up and &quot;exposed&quot; themselves so often leading up to the election? I mean, as someone who became very interested in politics for the first time this past election cycle and tried to look at everything objectively, it seems like almost everything she did from the primaries to election day worked to alienate, disenfranchise, or build a false sense of security in enough people to allow Trump to win (and possibly carry out her/the elites agenda) much more easily than she ever could have in office.</p>

<p>Disclaimer: I&#39;m not saying I believe these things to be true, I just think it&#39;s odd that no one has contemplated this possibility before. What I&#39;m looking for is a discussion on the possibility. This subreddit seems to have been flooded with people that are seemingly obsessed with these DNC conspiracy theories that are lacking on hard evidence. Well, what if it&#39;s all a rouse to get the conspiracy theorists (those of us who would actually put the time and effort into exposing something like this) looking the wrong way? Meanwhile you have a public that either blindly supports Trump (and is seemingly unwilling to question anything he does), aggressively opposes Trump (who are made out to be &quot;liberal babies&quot; who are just whining because their side did not win), or those that are so fed up with all of this that they&#39;ve stopped paying attention a long time ago. Isn&#39;t that exactly what these elitists would want? A public that has given up, or is too busy fighting with each other that they don&#39;t see what&#39;s really going on? Anyway, I&#39;m relatively new to all this and I figured I&#39;d let you all weigh in. Peace &amp; Blessin&#39;s</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Part of what plan?  To have Clinton throw the election?  Why?  To put Donald Trump in?  Why?  So that the public could put its guard down thinking <a href="http://www.clipartbest.com/cliparts/Rid/g8G/Ridg8Ga6T.jpeg">&quot;The people finally won!&quot;</a> or whatever tf and <em>then</em> TPTB can swoop in and use DT to put in even worse legislation than Clinton would have?  I mean...I don&#39;t understand why TPTB would have wanted Clinton <em>not</em> to get in.</p>

<p>And no...I didn&#39;t actually read what you posted under your OP.  Gonna do that now.  Maybe you answered all this there.  :)</p>

<p>EDIT:  Just read everything.  First and foremost, let me say that I don&#39;t like Trump, but I <em>really</em> don&#39;t like Clinton - so I&#39;m glad she didn&#39;t get in.  That said, I think TPTB might have been able to control the masses better w/Clinton in because she could have put everyone to sleep a bit more.  Trump - though he might raise racial tensions and cause a civil war in the US - might also cause people to &quot;gun the fuck up&quot; a lot more and stir some vinegar in folks enough to not stand for the establishment&#39;s b.s.  Clinton would have <em>taken</em> those guns - which TPTB are absolutely salivating to make happen.</p>

<p>I think TPTB absolutely wanted Clinton to get in, and the leaks fucked up their whole plan and they&#39;re still scrambling hard as hell right now to STILL somehow get that bitch in office actually (smfh).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah,  i can totally see it.  In fact,  i don&#39;t know how i didn&#39;t see it.  They propped Trump in the media from the beginning.  Then they rigged the primaries so Hillary had to be against him.  But then she literally had the worst presidential campaign of all time. Before the election people were saying the Republican party was over.  Now it looks like the dems are over.  At least for another 8 years. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>lol I would argue the opposite actually. Hillary (or some higher power) is still running the show and donald is still the plant. See Hillary has been championing certain issues that don&#39;t necessarily make it easy for her to carry out her true objectives. All these lobbyists/ceo&#39;s/1% who she would have been catering to all while trying to put up this facade to the public that she was not, well donald can just blatently get away with it apparently. He doesn&#39;t need to hide it, he can just appoint these people to his cabinet and cut out all the bullshit of trying to make it seem as though they care about the common people.</p>
