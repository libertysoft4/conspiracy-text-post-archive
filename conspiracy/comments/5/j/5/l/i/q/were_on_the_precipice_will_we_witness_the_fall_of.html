<p>To be honest, the only non-shill split I see here is whether Trump is in on &quot;the plan&quot; or not. If he&#39;s not (and so far, if the MSM&#39;s panic-mode are any indication, he&#39;s not), and I honestly can&#39;t even believe I&#39;m saying this... there is a very real possibility that we&#39;ll see HRC... and, the Creator and Its reflection within us willing... those around her, brought to justice for their crimes. Exciting times, to say the least.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Any new administration from an opposing party to the one leaving office could accuse and convict the previous administration of crimes and it could become customary for that last administration to be punished most severely. </p>

<p>The civilized but deeply flawed  plan of protection is to always allow the former administration  to get away without any kind of charges or convictions. This kind of tradition insures continued &#39;dignity&#39; to government  and allows a continuous &#39;harangue&#39; of criminal activity by each new administration. </p>

<p>You can readily imagine the only kind thing that would stop this &#39;continuity of government&#39; style of crime.</p>

<p>It will escalate until it breaks.</p>

<p>The feeling of hopelessness sticks with you for life. </p>

<p>The people that refugee their country because of war are on complete different level from the people who make a concious choice to become immigrants in search of better life.  They never truly left. </p>

<p>They feel like they betrayed those who they&#39;ve left behind, and they feel like their country betrayed them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I just had an idea. Maybe it&#39;s naive but here goes...</p>

<p>All countries and all religions meet and agree to teach the importance of one principle above all others... The Golden Rule. </p>

<p>Treat other people the same way you&#39;d like to be treated... or else just let them be.</p>

<p>If everybody agreed to this and taught this to their kids, a generation would grow up that wouldn&#39;t need a military or intelligence agencies and much of the government that exists right now.</p>

<p>I&#39;m also thinking that even in a Golden Rule world, you&#39;d still have a few rule-breakers trying to get ahead at other&#39;s expense. So you&#39;d still need an honest justice system.</p>

<p>If people really wanted to live this way, it could happen. But I really suspect that, at some level, people <em>enjoy</em> trying to pull a fast one on someone else... whether they get away with it or not.</p>
