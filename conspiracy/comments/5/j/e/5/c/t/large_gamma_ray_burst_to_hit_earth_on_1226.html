        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I&#39;ve been following this Gamma Ray burst that is suppose to hit earth with its final wave on 12/26. 
I figured I would post info here bc the ripples of waves continue to hit. If this is true then we are looking at some major destruction Christmas. </p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/shared?ci=vNvfBz96790">Gamma Ray to hit 12/26 </a></p>

<p>We have felt a few ripples of this Gamma ray of energy in the last few months, and it looks like the final wave is gonna do some damage. </p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/shared?ci=CfB26Tv0XII">Ripples of the Gamma Ray </a></p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/shared?ci=kz3-4D4vyvE">Ripples of Gamma Ray 2</a></p>

<p>First off, our protective shield collapsed a few months back when Obama signed the executive orders to <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2016/10/13/executive-order-coordinating-efforts-prepare-nation-space-weather-events">Prepare for space weather </a>
So, we have no protection when this Gamma ray hits us. All of the Radiation will hit us full force and most likely cause major earthquakes.  </p>

<p>Since then we&#39;ve  had waves of energy hit earth, quakes have doubled and <a href="https://www.google.com/amp/www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-4028306/amp/The-dramatic-moment-giant-flaming-METEORITE-lights-sky-hammers-earth-hard-terrified-witnesses-Costa-del-Sol-felt-ground-move.html?client=safari">meterors have smashed into the planet at 45,000 mph</a></p>

<p>Has anyone heard of this?? Is this something we need to prepare for? Wth is NASA doing? They need to get off their ass and actually do something instead of floating in pools hoaxing moon landings. </p>

<p>i&#39;ve prepped, and yet i&#39;m hopeful that nothing will happen, but my soul tells me something terrible is about to happen. yeah, i know that sounds kooky. but if someone wants to dissect all this crazy shit happening, please do. those noises from the sky in spokane are the creepiest. they evoke a feeling of overwhelming doom for me, i can&#39;t explain it. they give me the feels.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have the same feeling... I feel as the universe is at war, a spiritual war.  These elites want to open the gates of hell and welcome Lucifer. They been opening up the 4th dimension with CERN. Christmas is a celebration for Satan and the pope and queen  Elizabeth said our last Christmas was last year. 
I prepared too bc I&#39;m not about to go to FEMA camps if SHIT went down lol it&#39;s good to stay prepared. 
That sounds like haarp they use to cause natural disasters. I&#39;m sure they are using the haarp for these gamma rays. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Haarp works by heating the atmosphere in conjunction with certain types of cloud seeding. It is only capable of creating storms and if half the crap out there about it is to be believed, it hardly ever works the way they want. The only affect it could possibly have related to this is the destruction of the atmosphere, not the magnetic field. Also hell isnt real. Their motivations have nothing to do with lucifer, the annunaki, or whatever crazy pseudo theological beings that keep getting stuck to these actual events</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have google and Wikipedia at my fingertips, which I use when in doubt. It seems like doubt for some people means the least likely possibility is the most possible. </p>

<p>If you don&#39;t want to believe wikipedia, several documentaries about what harp can actually do have been released since the military admitted they use it for weather control. I&#39;m sure you&#39;ll be hard pressed to find a single one talking about its ability to destroy the magnetic field surrounding earth. 
From Wikipedia: The most prominent instrument at the HAARP Station is the Ionospheric Research Instrument (IRI), a high-power radio frequency transmitter facility operating in the high frequency (HF) band. The IRI is used to temporarily excite a limited area of the ionosphere. Other instruments, such as a VHF and a UHF radar, a fluxgate magnetometer, a digisonde (an ionospheric sounding device), and an induction magnetometer, were used to study the physical processes that occur in the excited region.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Supposedly in 2004 the gamma ray took a chunk out of our shield. One year later the govt brought up &quot;global warming&quot; they blamed global warming was manmade. 
But was actually bc of the gamma ray taking a chunk out of the allen belt. 
Then oct 13 obama signed executive orders to prepare for space weather and micheal around the world (a YouTuber) said our protective shield collapsed. Even if that guy is a fraud, I still believe in2004 something happen to our protective shield bc the UN came up with this &quot;GLOBAL warming&quot; BS </p>

<p><a href="https://i.sli.mg/5YneOe.gif">https://i.sli.mg/5YneOe.gif</a></p>

<p>Later on, it gets curly, so the wave itself must have interacted with the surface water&#39;s temperature (participation rate) and the oceanic currents take the cooled (bluer) and warmer (redder) watter along with them:</p>

<p><a href="https://i.sli.mg/CNEAbC.gif">https://i.sli.mg/CNEAbC.gif</a></p>

<p>Bear in mind that <strong>each frame is 1 hour apart from the other</strong>. You can really see the currents interacting with the participation patterns.</p>

<p>Wrong. We haven&#39;t lost our atmosphere, which is really good at absorbing high-energy particles.</p>

<p>There is only one known GRB candidate in the Milky Way, which is close enough to do real damage to life on the planet, and there is no evidence that it has begun. It is estimated that it may occur within the next 500,000 years, and even if it does erupt, there&#39;s only a small chance that it would be directed toward us.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, they don&#39;t have magnetic shields to protect astronauts. They hope to, some day, but the energy requirements are immense. We don&#39;t have nearly enough storage capacity to do something like this. The scientists are presumably hoping that storage capacity increases, or the ability to launch with a nuclear fusion reactor on board becomes possible in the next 50 years.</p>

<p>Earth&#39;s magnetic field is created by its molten iron core. It takes a sphere of molten iron 700+ miles in diameter to generate it. I don&#39;t see a small nuclear reactor doing anything like that.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>6.5 TeV is the equivalent of the energy of motion of about 6 mosquitoes.</p>

<p>CERN works because it puts that energy into the width of a couple of atoms, rather than in the size of a flying mosquito. It is not &quot;really high energy&quot; compared to the things around you. It&#39;s &quot;really high energy&quot; in a really, really, really small space.</p>

<p>CERN does not impact the Earth&#39;s magnetic field.</p>

<p>Any coincidence of CERN operating an accelerator and Earth&#39;s dynamic fields changing is just that.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think there was a small energy wave. I kept shocking myself and hair was static. But it wasn&#39;t as big as they played it out to be. I mean there were tons of ppl moving their sleeping area into the basement, ppl stocking up with food etc to get ready for the wave. 
This news came from a bunch of you tubers... I think they do this for viewers to generate money. 
Shit like this definitely will make you think twice about Planet X lol I mean... how long has this planet suppose to hit earth?? 2 years? </p>
