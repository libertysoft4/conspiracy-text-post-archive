    <div class="md"><p>Did not answer on Sandy Hook, Aurora, Pulse, Aliens, flying Saucers, or P-G8. P-G8 is a tricky question. I&#39;m sure we have as much wrong as we have correct, but obviously the elite are wrapped up in pedophilia and have been for centuries/ages.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t care about aliens and flying saucers, real or not.</p>

<p>The problem with all of these things is that the official stories for every one of them are obviously half truths wrapped in lies meant to obfuscate the truth and misdirect attention.</p>

<p>Particularly with Pizzagate. I don&#39;t think the conspiracy as a whole is exactly on the money, but at the same time it is my belief that it&#39;s much worse and grander than anything yet revealed or proposed.</p>

<p>The rest of the things I haven&#39;t mentioned are obvious &quot;yes.&quot;</p>

<p>Physics does not allow it - the law of conservation of energy has not ever failed to date. Also, if stealing small amounts of energy were possible, then a small machine could power a bigger machine, and ... positive feedback, the Earth gets over-heated.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Inventions above a certain level of efficiency have been suppressed since roughly 1954. They never see the light of day. </p>

<p>My idea as to the reason is that I&#39;d personally love to have unlimited free energy but I&#39;m afraid of what a more greedy or aggressive person might do with that same gift.</p>

<p>The government may feel similarly about foreign possession of free or unusually cheap energy.</p>

<p>Some 5400 patents were denied in  circa 2012 for being too efficient. Ultra efficient patents are possible. They do exist. They&#39;re suppressed.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Metaphors are only helpful when they are accurate. Conservation of energy, e.g. &quot;energy is never lost or created but merely transformed&quot; is a fundamental axiom of physics. You may say that it is just an assumption. Well, it has NEVER been shown to be violated.</p>

<p>If you drive a modern car, it comes with safety features. The design of those features implicitly assumes that the concept of conservation of energy is real, e.g. you can transform the kinetic energy of moving car and passenger into deforming the body of the car, heating it up a little. Regenerative electrical breaking works on the same principle - there is no friction. You are merely charging a battery using the rotation of the car wheels and that itself can slow the car down.</p>

<p>You are using and relying on all sorts of mechanical and even electronic widgets every day, the design of which relies on the law of conservation of energy.</p>

<hr/>

<p>The closest you could get to &quot;free energy&quot; is turning mass into energy according to E=mc<sup>2.</sup> That still is not free energy. </p>

<p>In fact, we are turning a small amount of mass into energy all the time. A charged battery weighs slightly more than a discharged one. Burning wood turns it into ash and CO2 and other components and their combined mass is less than that of the wood.</p>

<p><a href="http://physics.stackexchange.com/questions/16351/mass-converted-to-energy-in-a-common-fire">http://physics.stackexchange.com/questions/16351/mass-converted-to-energy-in-a-common-fire</a></p>

<p>On the other hand, photosynthesis works in reverse - the tree absorbs water, minerals, etc. as well as CO2 and sunlight to create wood, and thanks to the presence of sunlight, the mass of the wood is going to be slightly higher than that of the individual components that went into making this tree.</p>

<hr/>

<p>So, again, when it comes to burning for example, you can&#39;t get energy out of nothing. You have to turn some mass into energy and with fuels like gasoline, diesel, kerosene, you turn a higher fraction of the original mass into thermal energy than in the case of wood. Nuclear fusion and fission are using an even bigger fraction of the original mass of the fuel. </p>

<p>That energy is not free though, or else you would not have &quot;depleted Uranium&quot; for example.</p>

<p>Flying Saucers = real, but man made</p>

<p>Hidden History = Major Conspiracy</p>

<p>Free Energy - Depends on which you&#39;re talking about.  Tesla was misunderstood--wireless, NOT free energy.  Orgone is bullshit.  Subtle energy via piezoelectric effect is (most likely) legit coverup if indeed was used for pyramids and places like Rockwall, TX.  (Think dancing/chanting/playing instruments around a platform until a craft had enough charge to be released and launched via supercharged magnetic polarity, like railgun.). Mercurial engines = bullshit.</p>

<p>PizzaGate = real/fake -- Real in that there are elite satanic pedo rings.  Fake in that the info provided in pizzagate research is all circumstantial evidence, not enough to prosecute.  Not to mention it exploding overnight when elite pedo shit has been going on for time immemorial.</p>

You should add Flat Earth which is now my favorite from the standpoint of how mind blowing and powerful it is AND how easily it is to prove true through measurements (lasers, etc) and observations. This one relies heavily on moon landing as a hoax which i also recently didnt believe but do now, its all CGI. Think about how sacred the human race really is in a flat earth/one sun /one moon/ possibly no space world.

    <div class="md"><p>Coming from someone who has grown up sailing on open waters and being coastal navigation as well as open water navigation certified, I&#39;ll tell you the world is not flat. </p>

<p>Landmarks on land disappear below the horizon if you travel out far enough. Light refraction actually supports this, without refraction your eyes would be able to see reflecting  light around a corner the same way you would standing right next to it. (I.e. A mirror around a corner as opposed to in front of it) The only thing you have to navigate with at that point is the sun, moon and stars. Stars rotate and are never in the same spot above on consecutive days. Travel across the equator multiple times in one trip and you will 100% understand how the earth is.</p>

<p>I looked into all this before due to curiosity. But it&#39;s utter bs. I&#39;d recommend looking at the concave earth theory. While not as wild, a lot more plausible. </p>

If the earth is a globe then so be it But thats not what evidence and my instincts is telling me. Im going on 40 and fed up with the bullshit. I called bullshit on Day 1 of 9/11 and received so much crap for it. Ive stuck to my guns because of the evidence. My attachment to conspiracy theories is only out of desire for truth and good for us regular people being played by an incredibly rigged and apparently evil system of puppet masters. Bring it down! I find flat earth exceptionally capable of bringing it down. It just takes people like yourself to consider the idea with an open mind. Not easy to do considering we were taught the globe in kindergarten!</p>

<p>Flat Earth Bullet Points:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Video of independent high altitude balloon tests. The horizon is FLAT (be leary of fish eye lenses indended to distort/ deceive). As balloon goes up Earth continues to &quot;rise&quot; with camera as perspective is improved. At no time does earth drop out which would be case as you rise off of a globe. Common rebuttal is that the earth is curved but so great in diameter that curve cant be seen. That isnt proof of globe model and you are taking that on faith. Demand evidence!</p></li>
<li><p>Boats dont disappear over curved ocean horizon, they just disappear from human sight, and can be brought back into view with binoculars. Basic trigonometry can be used to make tests.</p></li>
<li><p>Planes use mechanical gyroscopes for altitude control. No compensation is ever necessary by pilot for curvature of earth. Keep flying straight and flat per the gyroscope. </p></li>
<li><p>Ancient world maps. UN logo is the flat earth map. Globe concept didnt appear till Copernicus 1492 or so.</p></li>
<li><p>Moon landing was a hoax, just like 9/11, sandy hook, JFK, etc. There is a pattern of deceptive events of large scale to maintain control of population and power.</p></li>
<li><p>All it would take to prove globe earth is a 360 selfie video from ISS. Never seen one. images from NASA are CGI and so utterly fake.</p></li>
<li><p>Look into NASA and their massive budget (thats your money they are using by the way). Total bullshit organization, 6 or so of the original 7 astronauts from space shuttle challenger are still alive. Look how CGI their shit is. So much money goes into DoD/ pentagon/ nasa. If we had that much money, we too could pull off a conspiracy of this size.</p></li>
<li><p>All the weirdness concerning Antarctica. John Kerry. Vatican. No country is permitted to claim land per treaty. Spiritual place. In FE model, south pole surrounds us 360 on all sides. North pole at center. Look at google maps images of antarctica, in this day and age you are telling me they cant just map the whole globe? Why havent they? Because it isnt possible.</p></li>
<li><p>Watch time lapses of sun and tell me you trully believe the sun is 93,000,000 miles away. Look how its size changes so much as it moves closer to you and then gets smaller as it moves away. Consider the yin yang concept and flow of sun and moon, both of nearly equal size, much smaller and much closer. Both equals and not heliocentric or sun centered. Try experiencing the sun and moon with a renewed mindset. Let your senses be your guide.</p></li>
<li><p>Flight paths in the southern hemisphere are goofy, and can be explained with FE. Southern hemisphere is where the glibe model really falls apart.</p></li>
<li><p>Why dont we feel the earth spinning at 1,000 miles per hour? Not even the slightest, maybe just a tiny bit? Nope. FE model has stationary earth just like we experience.</p></li>
<li><p>Why does our picture of the moon never change? Same side every time? Moon is flat and also not a sphere. Space doesnt necessarily exist in FE.</p></li>
<li><p>Musicians sang about it in secret/ code. Beatles, Pink Floyd, Nirvana.</p></li>
<li><p>FE is intentionally ridiculed, even by the POTUS. By now i have figured out to look into what they mock as they are likely hiding something. Look at pizzagate and fake news. There is obviously a high level pedophilia ring but instead od ackowledging, investigating and PROSECUTING, it is all dismissed and labeled fake news. Shit is so obvious!</p></li>
<li><p>Last one addressing intent. They want you to think the universe is sooooo big and you are soooo small and meaningless and accidental.  In FE model, the earth is suddenly all we have, sacred and beautiful as we know it.</p></li>
<li><p>Ok one more, think about the climate debate now in light of flat earth. Maybe climaye change deniers actually are onto something? How about aliens/ETs?</p></li>

    <div class="md"><p>Moon landing was real but they took PR shots, flat earth is a psyop and I heard and experienced it&#39;s really about layers between dimensions, there&#39;s a flat frequency barrier between them and they look different from each side, prolly some kind of vibration our tools can&#39;t measure yet. Maybe not free energy but definitely a way more efficient energy source, I met aliens sure about their existence and yeah there&#39;s lot of disinfo regarding free energy/aliens I think because they know disclosure is imminent and they get off on confusion, fear etc.</p>

<p>edit: I think Rupert Shekldrake&#39;s morphogenetic fields theory ties into dimension thing: <a href="https://www.lifepositive.com/in-resonance/">https://www.lifepositive.com/in-resonance/</a></p>
