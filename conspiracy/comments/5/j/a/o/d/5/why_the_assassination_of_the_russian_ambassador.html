<p>Why is the floor around his fallen body so immaculate when there should be a pool of blood?</p>

<p>Why was the assassin able to stand around and give his backstory for the attack without coming under fire?</p>

<p>Why were there no other policeman besides the assassin near the Russian ambassador?</p>

<p>Why were there no armed bodyguards from the Russian embassy near him?</p>

<p>Is it standard practice to leave an ambassador alone with NO SECURITY at a public event in a high-terror nation like Turkey?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The last question is worth asking for sure. Why were there no gaurds or security to return fire? They said he was &quot;neutralized,&quot; but when and how? Theoretically, the shooter could have used blanks which, at that range, could&#39;ve disturbed the ambassador&#39;s clothes. Were there photos of the scene afterward showing blood? </p>

<p>Edit: shooter was and killed. Saw photos. A lot more blood than the ambassador.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There&#39;s photos of the assassin shot dead, small amounts of blood too. Small caliber, round nose bullets would have small entrance and exit wounds resulting in less blood on both the ambassador and the assassin. From the video, though, the ambassador&#39;s jacket moves in time with a shot. Shouldn&#39;t we see the front of his shirt have some blood soaking through? Was anyone else at the event hit? Those shots would have passed through him and into (or near depending on the angle) the crowd. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>There&#39;s quite a bit of blood on the assassin. It looks like he was probably using a 9mm. Not massive, but not small. At any rate, I would expect to see some blood somewhere around the ambassador. </p>

<p>Regardless of whether the ambassador died or not, I think the timing of this, and what the assassin shouted after are suspicious.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve seen a lot of episodes of the First 48... this looks like a &quot;normal&quot; crime scene... they aren&#39;t ever as bloody as they look like on tv and movies. </p>

<p>In my head I have this pinned as the back right corner of the area where he was pacing in the video... I&#39;d like to see the layout of the room... cause the angle from the bullet holes look like the shooters flanked in quite close and fired as he was going down... maybe he was behind the podium the guy was giving his speech at... and was hit there... dropped and tried to move back towards the wall... I&#39;d say it looks like more than one shooter cause a couple of the holes in the wall look higher caliber than the others... but I feel like they got inside and up on him before firing... Thats just my spidey-sense though. </p>

<p>I&#39;m no gun expert, but I think he blew his only clip all into the dude&#39;s back. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks for the reverse angle... I think the photographer must be standing in roughly the same spot the shooters body ended up... </p>

<p>I wonder if there is an exit over where those people are huddling... I&#39;d guess not cause they prolly all be heading for it.... though they do seem clustered there... I feel like thats where the shots that killed the shooter came from... that general direction. </p>

<p>Is that the camera that recorded the shooting hidden behind the PA? Cause whatever it was recorded on was on a tripod... </p>

<p>Now I got to go back and see if I can see the shooter acknowledged the existence of the man that took this picture standing there at this point in the event... </p>

<p>edit - Looks like he does shoot a glance over where that camera man would be standing... </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Here&#39;s why I think it&#39;s a false flag:</p>

<ul>
<li>It&#39;s too neat. </li>
</ul>

<p>Ambassador gets shot 9/10 times, no blood. </p>

<p><a href="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/C0D4G61W8AA_adx.jpg">Assassin gets shot</a>, blood everywhere? Also, I cannot find any other photos/video of assassin getting shot. Why not? The cameras were already there and in place. </p>

<ul>
<li>If <a href="https://sli.mg/zDo1Kb">this</a> is because</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
<p>It&#39;s blown open by the force of the bullet hitting his body.. Not some wind/gas.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>there has to be some blood in the front of his shirt, because of the exit wound. If the shirt wasn&#39;t blown open/puffed up because of the bullet, what caused it? </p>

<ul>
<li></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
<p>According to witness at the site, the gunman suddenly rushed behind Karlov and shot, then Karlov fell to the ground. The gunman also shot at spectators at the site, according to a witness.</p>

<p>“He (the gunman) firstly pointed his gun to the ambassador, then turned his gun to us. We lay prone on the ground because of panic. I saw the gunman pointed his gun to the ceiling, and the ambassador fell down,” said a witness. <a href="http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/live-russian-ambassador-shot-dead-9486164">Source</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>The <a href="http://www.trbimg.com/img-58583691/turbine/chi-ambassador-assassination-wre0045340148-20161219">expressions</a> on their faces reminds me of other false flags. Some are not even looking at the gunman, and some look bored. </p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://i.imgur.com/UJprFOG.jpg">This photo</a> (credit u/teslasmuse). Is this how you would behave if there was a gunman/assassin (who just killed someone) behind you? They look like they just got out of a boring work meeting while the shooter is still talking behind them AFTER KILLING SOMEONE.</li>
</ul>

<p>But what do I know, I&#39;m just an asshole on the internet. </p>

<p>Why the assassination of the Russian ambassador appears faked. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>You bring up some good questions and something looks funny but one thing you can&#39;t fake is the fact that the guy who got shot is an actual Russian ambassador.  </p>

<p>I&#39;m still waiting for what Putin has to say about all of this.  It seems he&#39;s remaining mysteriously silent on the issue so far.  </p>

<p>If this were an American ambassador getting assassinated, Obama would have held a press conference <em>today</em>.  </p>
