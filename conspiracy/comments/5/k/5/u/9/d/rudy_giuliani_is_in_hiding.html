        <h3 class="title">Rudy Giuliani is in hiding</h3>
        <p><span class="badge badge-primary">26</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;2016-12-25 by <a class="author" href="../../../../../../../../user/Obsidianslim.html">Obsidianslim</a></p>
        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Here is the email I received... I&#39;m not sure on the details but it sounds viable, considering what&#39;s up:</p>

<p>&quot;Dear friend,</p>

<p>First, we want to think you for the work you are doing. Your efforts do not go unnoticed.</p>

<p>Mr. Giuliani has been taken to a safe location and we are awaiting instructions from a group of people we call light workers, who work behind the scenes to protect people like Rudy who come forward. They are patriots within our government, protecting what is left of our Republic and Constitution. </p>

<p>Yes, Mr. Giuliani is in grave danger, but he is safe for now. And indeed, they are using CGI and other methods to &quot;replace&quot; him.</p>

<p>What appears to be a hired group of COINTELPRO agents have taken over the Internet, declaring Rudy&#39;s brave statements a &quot;hoax&quot; and pointing everyone to a completely fake Twitter account (<a href="https://twitter.com/RudyGiuliani">https://twitter.com/RudyGiuliani</a>) that Mr. Giuliani has no access to and nothing to do with. These agents and agitators are easy to spot and identify.</p>

<p>We understand the skepticism as well, but Mr. Giuliani&#39;s safety is paramount. His safety is the priority, and at a later time when his safety can be assured, he is expected to make a public announcement -- but not within the borders of the United States. We cannot state in more urgent terms how serious this issue is for his safety, and that of his family and some of his close friends. His public statements on his official Twitter quickly caused an immediate response from the CIA, DHS and &quot;shadow&quot; elements within our government. We have been told there was &quot;panic&quot; when Rudy began speaking the truth.</p>

<p>Mr. Giuliani requests humbly that you spread his Official Statement far and wide on social media (this link -- <a href="http://henrymakow.com/2016/12/rudolph-giuliani-confirms.html">http://henrymakow.com/2016/12/rudolph-giuliani-confirms.html</a> -- contains the statement and his other Tweets for you to use). </p>

<p>The best way to help us is to spread the word, and re-post Rudy&#39;s statements about PizzaGate from his closed Twitter account using social media, like YouTube. His statements contain many truths that will lead you in the right direction. Do not let agitators and agents try to stop you, because they will, and they will attack and threaten you. (However, if you feel your safety is in doubt, please do not proceed.)</p>

<p>That is all we have for now. We will be in touch.</p>

<p>-- A patriot&quot;</p>

<p>How can you continue on being a good little slave when you know what&#39;s going on. I have hope that things are getting ready to change big time, they have too, otherwise I cannot live with the guilt of doing nothing. Occultists must relish the thought that so many are now widely aware of what&#39;s occurring and yet nothing is being done. Roman Catholic Church paid out like 4 billion or something last year to settle molestation charges against its holy priests. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>From your Makow leak, he&#39;s updated it</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Latest- Giuliani appeared on Fox this morning. He said Fox had cancelled. I don&#39;t believe this was CGI. Obviously the above statement was a scam to promote the fake news narrative. It&#39;s interesting the government is going to so much trouble to discredit the truth and truth seekers.</p>

<p>Yesterday--  Twitter suspended this account.  Here is the archived page.  &quot;Giuliani&quot; says he has been threatened.  Snopes, no doubt a CIA front, is saying this account was suspended because it was an imposter. It looks real. It still is the main account listed by google. They say he had no Twitter account. There is another started in August with 70K followers but no tweet since Dec 1.  It&#39;s possible this is an &quot;official&quot; Twitter feed while the suspended one was personal. It&#39;s also possible the suspended one was indeed a parody account. &quot;There are about four of them out there that pretend to be me,&quot; RG told Chuck Todd in October. But he didn&#39;t say, &quot;I don&#39;t have a Twitter account.&quot;</p>

<p>But how does a &quot;fake account&quot; get 11,000 followers in nine months? Why would he tolerate it? What &quot;Giuliani&quot; says in his Statement is true. It&#39;s possible he was spurred by his rejection for Sec. of State. 
It&#39;s also possible that this is a &quot;fake news&quot; psy op. i.e. A phoney RG reveals the truth and then the real RG denies he said it. Thus the real truth is discredited.  </p>

<p>My view is that the truth is never a hoax. I am concerned however that this Statement wasn&#39;t on his official Twitter account, the one with 70K followers.</p>

<p>As Glen says (Comments), this does seem &quot;too good to be true.&quot; But I&#39;d rather be thought gullible than risk discounting a genuine whistle blower. I believe man&#39;s higher nature does shine through and will triumph</p>

<p>Who cares about his twitter feed if he isn&#39;t in hiding because he came on FOX.  Are you saying you think Guiliani is CGI?  </p>

<p>And thanks for the downvote on a quote and your lack of reasoning skills, this really kicks the disinfo can down the road don&#39;t you think?</p>

I don&#39;t know who the real Giuliani is and I asked him to provide more proof, but of course if the OP email is real, then he won&#39;t be able to prove it until he is somewhere safe. You may be right, I just don&#39;t have any more info yet...</p>
