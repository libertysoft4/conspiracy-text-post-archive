And like many of you, with so much disgust for Clinton, I cherry picked some Trump ideas, got on the_donald and road the high energy mix of blasting MSM and talkin&#39; conspiracies for last few months.  I got out of the_donald today after coming here and seeing how infested it is with circle jerkers.  We had lefts/rights agreeing and discussing whats really happening in this world and now the trump train has dug its hooks in and brought tremendous bias to a place 2 years ago felt like it had almost zero compared to every other sub out there.  I didn&#39;t  have a problem with trump supporters, hell I supported them when all my liberal friends were being sore losers.  But now this Isreal stuff...some of the team picks...this sub should be in an uproar as the elite stay in power and no justice has been served for anything anyone up there has done.  Reddit has gone to shit...this sub has been divided by shills and trump circle jerkers alike.  If this sub continues down this path im not sure where I&#39;ll go but it wont be here.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Prior to the election we all knew both parties were corrupt.  Now that we have elected Trump, there are those who feel he is part of the same establishment and those who feel he is not.  I honestly have no idea where Trump stands with regards to the establishment but I hope he has been honest with the American people.  Within 6 or 12 months we should have a good idea of what Trump&#39;s agenda is; at that point I see this community realigning in a particular direction.  Right now there is no reason not to embrace Trump, as he is our best shot at &quot;draining the swamp.&quot;</p>

<p>Im just going to keep an open mind. See what happens. Nothing else anyone can really do about it now. </p>

<p>Right now, the media is still against him. The political and hollywood elites are still against him. You would think some of this shit would have died down if he was a puppet of the elite. </p>

<p>So I really dont know what&#39;s going on, but like I said,  I am going to keep an open mind about it and see what happens. </p>

Considering everything they have done to &quot;hurt&quot; him has done nothing but help him. How many stories are we gonna have that make him look like shit but lack sinple evidence?

<p>Edit: and I bet you were hoping for a better response. But posts like these are a dime a dozen, the meta bullshit that goes on in this sub is the worst part of it. The drama and shitposts are something none of us want to deal with. There are definitely shills and faithful supporters for all sorts of topics beyond Trump. People are upset with Trump&#39;s behaviors, but then again there are people who are pretending he is the greatest and those who blindly follow him. Donald Trump hasn&#39;t ruined this sub, he&#39;s just added to the noise. I don&#39;t know what you are asking for but I think these things should have a &#39;Meta&#39; tag or something so I and others can know when to stay the out. Again, bye thanks for nothing.</p>

<p>So many drank the kool-aid and now they&#39;re dealing with the cognitive dissonance that follows.</p>

<p>The elites played this election perfectly. They made &quot;the people&quot; think they won. Well done, chaps.</p>

I like Trump cuz he triggers cucks and is good entertainment, but watching these people eat up every word that comes out of his mouth is pathetic and thats the thing its at the point were you cant even question him. LoL ive been on T_D since it was pure satire and only people who have been there since day 1 will actually know the sub was created to bash and make fun of Trump...</p>

I shouldn&#39;t care but I&#39;m anti-war and Soviet bombs would have probably crumbled in mid-flight and hit us Canadians while en-route to the USA. Now Trump seems to be alienating China, and showing how cozy he is to Israel. Why does it now seem there will be war either way? Maybe I&#39;m thinking to deep into things. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes.  I had such a grasp on that concept.  I was always a liberal leaner and watching them implode while supporters stood by blindly was gross.  The military spending in this country is out of control and people who have been here since before the election know exactly why.. I lost sight of that momentarily when it seemed like all main stream elite pushed back so hard on trump.  But seems now that was plan b for them all along and i fell for it.  Im not perfect.  </p>
