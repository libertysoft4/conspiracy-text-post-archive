        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>This is deep down the rabbit hole so I&#39;m just going to jump in.</p>

<p>Archons are hidden negative controllers of humankind, inorganic interdimensional entities that must now be exposed and exorcised from the individual human mind, from our human species, and from the planet as a whole as part of our collective evolution to a new state of consciousness and being.</p>

<p>(<a href="http://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/vida_alien/alien_archons16.htm">http://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/vida_alien/alien_archons16.htm</a>)</p>

<p>The reason you hear people or David Icke refer to &quot;ruling family bloodlines&quot; is because humanity is controlled by 13 bloodlines.</p>

<p>These bloodlines hold the genetic DNA blueprint required for these archons to survive on. Devoid of empathy, love, positivity, these beings are the literal reincarnational opposite of what human beings truly are.</p>

<p>Our reality has been hijacked, our emotions manipulated, our culture destroyed, divided, attacked.</p>

<p>We are not a hateful species. We do not truly resonate at a level of negativity, anger, fear, hatred, but by control through financial institutions, pharmaceutical companies, military, entertainment, food, media, EVERYTHING. We have been controlled and put into a state of constant fear, worry, anxiety, the exact opposite of what we are as humans.</p>

<p>The archons feed off negativity and the fear vibrations of human beings that are constantly induced in those states because of the lifestyle that has been constructed for us to control us as modern day slaves.</p>

<p>&quot;Although archons do exist physically, the real danger they pose to humanity is not invasion of the planet but invasion of the mind.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;The archons are intrapsychic mind-parasites who access human consciousness through telepathy and simulation. They infect our imagination and use the power of make-believe for deception and confusion.&quot;</p>

<p>I hope I am tying this together well enough. With 13 ruling bloodlines, with the genetic DNA blueprint required for these entities to continue living through us contained in those 13 bloodlines.</p>

<p>By control of all major institutions required to live on this earth we are basically forced into their system of control.</p>

<p>By being subjugated to that voluntary control that appears as reality but is really controlling us they manage to keep humanity in a low state of vibrational being. </p>

<p>This has been done for eons. Everything dark in the world is related to this archons. Pedophile networks are tied to these negative beings that use the fear, depravity, and lack of light as a means to sustain itself.</p>

<p>Archons have become so disconnected from light, so disconnected from God source, they require the exact opposite of what God source is to survive because it is the polar opposite of what the creator is.</p>

<p>There is a massive silver lining to all of this. </p>

<p>The time we are going through now is the shift of ages. Mankind has finally broken through all systems of control and is awakening once again to global cosmic consciousness and self awareness.</p>

<p>This has been a long time in the making and the archons, the evil illuminati bloodlines that have controlled civilization in front of our own eyes, is finally crumbling.</p>

<p>Their power structure is DONE. Mankind is undergoing the expansion of consciousness and self realization of God source.</p>

<p>No longer will be accept being controlled. We have been physically, mentally, and spiritually controlled but we have defied it all and reopened up ourselves up to the true light of divine essence.</p>

<p>I hope to open a meaningful discussion on this topic and would rather avoid conflict with one another. We have been divided enough, it&#39;s time we discuss these issues of control that have plagued humanity for a long ass time.</p>

<p>We are all one, we are moving forward, and our time for global spiritual awakening is now!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Fucking lizards. I have a bearded dragon. I often remind him how easy it was to put him in a box. And he looks back at me like the walnut brain that eats his own waste that he is. Reptiles of the David Icke stripe are only marginally smarter. They&#39;re not to be feared. If they could scan you and make your head explode, they would do it to everyone and take over. But no, they lurk in the dark drinking blood and raping butts and basically insist humanity should be scared because they&#39;re slimy.</p>

<p>Well, fuck lizards. Let&#39;s get some human size tanks with big pieces of drift wood to throw them in. They&#39;ll be fine.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This post give me hope OP thank you. I believe humans are naturally good for we don&#39;t want to hate or be hated. 99% of us seek laughter, warm smiles and love from those we care about so why are we living in the hateful, spiteful, greedy world? It&#39;s time Humans start coming together. None of us want the alternative.</p>

<p>But what is the connection between this Puerto Rican UFO and Djinns? That it&#39;s a small heat source that is not visible to the crew of the plane at a great distance?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It is interesting to hear biblical phenomenon discussed in nonchristianese.  There is not much written in the scriptures (Jewish or New Testament) regarding the details of demons and other creatures in rebellion to our one God. And to be honest, the degree of evil and depth of hate for humans that pizzagate has revealed is beyond anything I could have imagined. </p>

<p>I&#39;m not sure I understand where your optimism for defeating this old &amp; powerful cabal comes from. Very few people even want to recognize it is happening. Frankly I cannot figure out exactly how it is progressing. As a govt/nation, all is still very compromised. Trump is being seduced/threatened/bribed(?) to fall in line with Oligarch agenda. And Oligarch agenda is global NWO. He came into office against war, now calls for nuke arsenal. </p>

<p>Which brings me to this:  there are many prophecies regarding the eventual near destruction of earth &amp; humanity in the war between God &amp; these evil beings. It includes the actual return of JESUS, the risen Messiah, dressed for battle and victorious over Satan &amp; his demons. </p>

<p>But before that occurs, the NWO *will be established. We will not be able to buy or sell without a &quot;mark of the beast&quot;. We will no longer use cash.  A very charismatic, global leader will deceive many and they will follow him, but his agenda is evil.  He will eventually sit in the Jewish temple. An event described as &quot;the abomination that causes desolation.&quot;  Many nations will wage war against Israel, a huge army from the north, which is the event called &quot;Armageddon.&quot;  It is at this point that JESUS will return and save the world &amp; humanity from total destruction. </p>

<p>I am skipping many details.  Many of these prophecies began to be revealed in Ezekiel, Isaiah, Psalms and in the New Testament by Jesus and writings of the apostles. One specifically pertinent was written by the apostle John-- the book of Revelation.  </p>

<p>They are difficult texts with ppl writing at times about futuristic technology or symbolic images. Many bible scholars have labored over them and you will be able to find good commentaries and interpretations regarding the background and relevance to the events at the time of the revelation and at the end times. </p>

<p>I write this to encourage a faith in our Creator and to seek/recognize His hand in the events coming at us. He left these words for us all, hoping we would see and let Him be our God. </p>

<p>Respectfully. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;To me it seems that the Fall is, higher-dimensionally, about the forces of divine light squeezing out the ankle-biters and the false light (beings posing as the divine light within the 4th density; the other side of the duality coin of the corrupt demiurge) From the inner surface of the Earth, vastly reducing limiting beliefs, wrapping thus the Earth in a 4th density blanket (as Adronis put it)... in other words, the influence they have been having on the human mind for eons is about to end. Hence, EVERYTHING. WILL. CHANGE.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Could this be the missing puzzle peice to pizza gate? Are these pedophile networks being exposed fronts for the negative generation of fear?</p>

<p>This concept is beginning to become more and more plausible by the day.</p>

<p>I truly believe this is the missing puzzle piece. Humanity has been so deceived by these archons, these lower dimensional vibrational negative energy vampires (think of a leech, a tick, etc) </p>

<p>That purposely create human strife, fear, wars, and negative circumstances to further feed on this negative vibration because it is the only way to sustain itself. It literally cannot consume energy any other way except by latching onto fearful and low vibrational third dimensional beings.</p>

<p>This is truly truly making sense now but is also so fucking crazy I can&#39;t believe it makes sense.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s what tied the missing puzzle piece for me.</p>

<h1></h1>

<h1></h1>

<p>&quot;And, it is further said that these Zuswazi, these Imbulu, or whatever you choose to call them, are not capable of eating solid food. They either eat human blood, or they eat that power, the energy that is generated when human beings, on the surface of the Earth, are fighting and killing each other in large numbers.</p>

<p>I met people who have fled from the early Masaki in Rwanda, from years ago, and these people were horrified by what was happening in their country. They said that the slaughter of the Hutus by the Watusi, and the Watusi by the Hutus, is actually feeding the Imanujela, monsters. Because the Imanujela like to inhale the energy that is generated by masses of people being terrified or being killed by other people.</p>

<p>Makua looked at me quite seriously and observed, &quot;If we look at the state of the world today, we can see their influence everywhere, and at every level. The could be thought of as psychic vampires. The e&#39;epa are mental forces that have the ability to intrude into the human mind. They operate through subterfuge and psychic stealth.</p>

<p>They are adversaries who are drawn to humans because they wish to acquire our human capacity for creative imagination. Humans are creators, and they are not. Because of this, the deceivers will always be thwarted by the superiority of our human species.&quot;</p>

<p>(<a href="http://unicusmagazine.com/skyfish.htm">http://unicusmagazine.com/skyfish.htm</a>)</p>

<h1></h1>

<h1></h1>

<p>But now the tide is changing and the balance of light is tipping the scale in its favor. These things are coming to light and we are dealing with the way we have negatively been living for hundreds of years. We are realizing the capacity for love we were truly built and meant for. Humanity is remembering it&#39;s love of the creator and the creators love of its creation.</p>

<p>This is truly beautiful. Truly eye opening. I can&#39;t help but shed a few tears for this cosmic play happening right in front our own eyes.</p>

<p><a href="Http://www.unicusmagazine.com/skyfish.htm">Http://www.unicusmagazine.com/skyfish.htm</a></p>

<p>A good simple quote:</p>

<p>“Humans are not the only beings with powerful minds. Attached to humanity are unseen beings that also are an organ of the earth. They share the metabolism of the earth, just as humans do. These beings form a spectrum from benevolent to harmful. They have been present alongside the human race from the beginning. The destiny of these beings and that of humans is intertwined. The Toltec’s call them Allies. The Allies lack a brain, which means they have no factory to create emotions, but they need the ethereal energy of emotions to sustain their life. Allies push humans to create traumas in order to create fear, which they feed upon.” </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I wish I didn&#39;t have evidence but everything is pointing to this.</p>

<p>I feel like we can agree that there would have to be more to the surface than pedophile rings, major global control of human populations, mass control of all institutions and currencies. What is the end goal with all that.</p>

<p>And that is where this is pointing to. It&#39;s time for mankind to understand that there is more to reality than what we see in front of us day to day. And the fact that we could be more than our physical bodies of meat that a lot of people insist we are.</p>

<p>And if one were to open up to the idea of such a concept, then the conclusion that one could also reach is that there are lower dimensional vibrational beings that feed on the negativity and fear vibrations of a higher aligned frequency than itself.</p>

<p>I want this to be wrong. I don&#39;t want such a negative state of consciousness to exist and possibly influence mankind. But that&#39;s what everything is pointing towards.</p>

<p>Here is one source of information that sparked a lot of this discussion. I really need help investigating this. It could be the huge final thing behind PizzaGate, all the depravity and negativity that&#39;s happened to mankind and suspended it in a repressed state.</p>

<p>Any help with this I greatly appreciate.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Essentially. Archons exhibit the polar opposite of love light joy and compassion and focus on the opposite of what that is.</p>

<p>We are all one, because everything originates from source, or the creator. So these archons are a part of creation unfortunately but there is a blessing to their negativity.</p>

<p>If it wasn&#39;t for them, humanity wouldn&#39;t be able to undergo a spiritual awakening because there would be no darkness to awaken from. No negativity to purge.</p>

<p>In effect, negativity, hatred, greed, and everything that has ruined planet earth is what in effect will cure it because it has helped us achieve self awareness.</p>
