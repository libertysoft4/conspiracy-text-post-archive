    <p class="byline text-muted mb-0"><a href="javascript:;" class="score"><span class="badge badge-secondary">150</span></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a class="author" href="../../../../../../../../user/kcmcadams.html">kcmcadams</a> 2016-12-25</p>
    <div class="md"><p>You want proof? </p>

<p>There are approximately two billion children (persons under the age of eighteen) in this world. however, since santa does not visit children of Muslim, hindu, jewish or Buddhists religions, this reduces old Chris Cringle&#39;s work load for christmas night to about 15% of the total, roughly 378 million at average (census) rate of 3.5 children per household, that comes to 108 million homes, presuming that there is a least one good child in each. </p>

<p>Santa has about 31 hours of christmas to work with, thanks to the different time zones and the rotation of the earth, assuming he travels east to west ( which seems fairly logical). this works out to be 967.7 visits per second. This is to say that for every christian household with at least one good child santa has around 1/1000th of a second to park the sleigh, hop out, jump down the chimney, fill the stockings, distribute the remaining presents under the tree, eat whatever snacks were left for him, get back in the chimney jump into the sleigh and get on to the next house. </p>

<p>Now assuming that each of these 108 million stops is evenly distributed around the earth (which we know is false, but we will accept the this for the purposes of the calculations)... we are now talking about .78 miles per household: a total trip of 75.5 million miles, not counting bathroom stops or breaks. this means santa and his sleigh are moving at about 650 miles per second- which is 3,000 times the speed of sound. for purposes of comparison, the fastest man made vehicle &quot;the ulysses space probe&quot; moves at a poky 27.4 miles per second, and a conventional reindeer can run at best 15 miles per hour.</p>

<p>The payload of the sleigh adds another interesting element. assuming that each child gets nothing more than a medium sized lego set ( we&#39;ll say about two pounds) the sleigh is carrying over 500 thousand tons, not counting the big man him self. On land, a conventional reindeer can pull no more than 300 pounds. even with the benefit of the doubt, the flying reindeer could pull lets say ten times the normal amount (that seem reasonable, right?) the job cant be done with just eight or even nine of them... </p>

<p>Santa would need approximately 360,000 of them. this increases the payload, not counting the weight of the sleigh, another 54,000 tons, or roughly seven times the weight of the Queen Elizabeth (the ship .... not the monarch) 600,000 tons traveling at 650 miles per second would create enormous air resistance. this would heat up the reindeer in the same fashion as a spacecraft reentering into the earths atmosphere.</p>

<p>The lead pair of reindeer would absorb 14.3 quintillion joules of energy per each second. in short, they would burst into flame almost instantaneously, exposing the reindeer behind them and creating a deafening sonic boom effect in their wake. the entire reindeer team would be vaporized within 4.26 thousands of a second, or right about the time santa reached the fifth house on his trip. not that it matters, however, since santa as a result of accelerating from a dead stop to 650 m.p.s. in.001 seconds, he would be subjected to acceleration forces of 17,500 g&#39;s. </p>

<p>A jolly 300 pound santa would be pinned to the back of the sleigh by 4,315,015 pounds of force, instantaneously crushing his bones and vital organs and reducing him to a quivering blob of pink, Santa goo. therefore, if santa did exist; He&#39;s dead now........ </p>

<p>Merry Christmas Everyone. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Santa and his reindeer were shot down over Roswell NM in 1947.  Since that time each acting President has had to work closely with corporations to fund a massive campaign trying to keep the Christmas spirit alive.  They covered it up with the aliens story, but come on, Santa was the only one who had levitation and time control technology.</p>

<p>In the late 90&#39;s, Bill Clinton signed an executive order to stop funding Christmas.  The national debt appeared to have a sudden miraculous recovery, but without the backing of the Christmas Spirit, new tech companies had no direction, causing the dot-com crash by 2000.</p>

<p>There are multiple theories as to what happened next.  Some say 9/11 was a warning from other countries to revive the upcoming Christmas season, some think Bush went on a rampage trying to control multiple sleighs simultaneously through his other robotic bodies (thus explaining his apparent while reading to a group of children), and still others believe there is a secret organization of elves trying to rebuild Santa&#39;s legacy in secret and made an attempt to take out the final location of US competition.</p>

<p>Many people have noted how Obama appears to have aged so dramatically during his term.  He actually tried to take it upon himself to be Santa for a couple years.  What he didn&#39;t realize was that Santa&#39;s time-slip technology freezes time for everyone else but didn&#39;t stop his own aging.  What appears to happen overnight for the rest of us actually takes about 7-8 years within the time bubble to deliver all those gifts.  Santa was immortal, but the toll on Obama was tremendous.</p>

<p>The coming years will be scary.  We lucked out in that Hillary wasn&#39;t elected to complete the job of destroying Christmas, however Donald is such a corporate Scrooge that he may actually require parents to <em>pay</em> for their children&#39;s presents, or even divert critical resources away from the massive project.</p>

<p>Insiders have suggested that our troops who are supposedly &quot;overseas&quot; are actually the manpower behind each year&#39;s Christmas miracles, but the effort and the secrets they must keep from their own families takes a huge toll on them.  Please keep their efforts in mind and support our troops and the magic they bring to everyone&#39;s families each season.</p>

<p>Peace to all, and whatever the truth is, remember that it&#39;s up to all of us to keep the holiday magic alive in Santa&#39;s absence.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Lamestream media shills cookin up the obvious lies here.  Pretty easy to see that Santa is a Monarch/MKUltra imprint meant to reinforce the patriarchal fascist corporatocracy being sold by TPTB.  Santa was the OG NSA: he knows when you&#39;re sleeping, when you&#39;re awake, the relative moral value of your daily deeds, and he&#39;s been recording this all on a list.  And he can do all that without needing you to even use a cellphone.  Also, I hear he keeps his &quot;elves&quot; in a basement underneath a DC pizza-shop, and the &quot;reindeer&quot; are all actually ancient-alien monstrosities.  Also, pretty sure Santa&#39;s in league with the pope, the jesuits, Turkey (both nation and fowl), and the Podestas.  Also, what kind of a &quot;saint&quot; needs so many aliases?  Checkmate, Mr. Kringle. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>We need to break Santa&#39;s massive Child Slavery foundation. Elves my ass. Everyone knows elves don&#39;t exist and that it is under aged children forced to work long hours building toys for the rich. Plus he has shills in the commercial industry in order to have the Christmas season take over the entire year. Think about how stores are decorating for Christmas earlier and earlier. Soon enough we will have 2 seasons. Summer and Christmas. After that Christmas will slowly take over the entirety of the year. When this happens Santa will finally be able to execute his plan. I don&#39;t know what he is planning but he&#39;s obviously using the whole gift delivery scheme to infiltrate our houses. I assume he&#39;s planting something in all of our homes I just don&#39;t know what it is. Remember to check your chimneys and stocking for anything suspicious. And I&#39;m guessing those dirty little &quot;Elf on a Shelf&quot; toys are in on it as well. They must report back to Santa every night and this is how he gets his surveillance done. I&#39;m thinking he&#39;s looking for more than just &quot;Naughty or Nice&quot; he&#39;s closing examining our lives. Trying to figure out everyone&#39;s schedule in order to get the most efficient impact on us.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>A former CERN employee revealed that Santa delivers his gifts via the Large Hadron Collider. Christmas trees are really antennae that transmit GPS coordinates and wishlists directly to CERN. The Large Hardon Collider then teleports the gifts to a location directly underneath the tree. Sometimes there are mishaps while the gifts are in transit, and this is why some children end up with Berenstein Bears books while everyone else gets copies of the Berenstain Bears.</p>

<p>So get this, If Santa can say &quot;Ho&quot; 3 times a second, &quot;Ho-ho-ho&quot;, and if you consider the blinding rate at which he would need to travel around the earth to deliver all those presents in 24 hours, then all of Santas &quot;Ho&quot;s would be in different area codes. Ludacris was definitely trying to tell us something with his area codes song.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Based on population figures, Santa will deliver gifts to 1.6 billion children.</p>

<p>This requires visiting 5,556 homes a second and eating 150 billion calories in milk and mince pies.</p>

<p>With an average of 2.5 children per household, Santa will need to make 640 million stops on Christmas Eve.</p>

<p>Each child needs 80cm of wrapping, which would stretch 1.5 million miles.</p>

<p>The total number of presents would set Santa back £279.27 billion.</p>

<p>Prior to the big night, Santa needs to store all these presents in a warehouse.</p>

<p>Assuming each present average out at 0.008 m3, the warehouse would need to cover the same space as 240,000 double-decker buses.</p>

<p>He would also have to travel at 1,800 miles per second.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Parents around the world conspire to commit psychological warfare upon unsuspecting Children. The claimed goal is to induce a state of joy with gifts from &quot;Santa Claus&quot;. Many Kindergarteners trying to expose the truth among friends are deemed, &quot;tinfoil hat conspiracy theorists&quot;. After all, they&#39;re claiming that ALL ADULTS are participating in a world wide conspiracy just to deceive them about the source of presents. </p>

<p>&quot;Why would they ALL lie to us?&quot;, says the bluepilled gradeschooler, &quot;That&#39;s crazy! Moms or Dads, maybe, but Grannies wouldn&#39;t lie.&quot; </p>

<p>A curious fence-sitter pipes up, &quot;I saw Santa and sat on his lap. Wouldn&#39;t parents want us to love them instead of a Santa stranger?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Shh, never tell them you don&#39;t believe in Santa or the presents will stop coming&quot;, whispers the most redpilled child.</p>

And all through the subreddit,
Not a creature was commenting,
Not even a shill.
The emails were all leaked by Assange with great care,
In the hopes that we&#39;d read them and all of us would share.
Children in DC have been snatched from their beds,
While visions of sugar plums dance in sheeps heads.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s about time we unmasked the lie about Santa. Santa doesn&#39;t visit every house, he visits the houses of Christians. Jews, Muslims, Buddhists, Hindus, pagans, Scientologists, Satanists, and atheists are shit out of luck.</p>

<p>Plus, he doesn&#39;t visit the houses of people without children. Singles and childless couples can go fuck themselves.</p>

<p>Plus, he doesn&#39;t visit the houses of bad children. Santa is only interested in good little boys and girls. The bad children he delegates to an elf, who puts coal in their stockings when he gets around to it.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve just reduced Santa&#39;s workload by over 90%. He has lots of time.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Come on man, it&#39;s called magic.</p>

<p>Santa uses replication magic to make millions of copies of himself and his sleigh/reindeer. Those copies have to stay fairly close to the original though or they lose their invisibility, so he flies around with them and acts as supervisor. The original Santa is what you see on the tracker. </p>

<p>These Santa copies then use individual portal sacks to teleport the correct gifts to that individual copy. This is all coordinated at the North Pole by the head elf, who also has millions of copies of him/herself. The elf copies talk to the Santa copies via satellite phone headsets (because Santa and Co. can be modern too, let&#39;s be real), to ensure the correct gifts are delivered. Elf engineers have optimised this process very efficiently to allow for faster delivery (and therefore less copies and lower magical cost). </p>

<p>More recently, elves have developed a code system for different houses, to inform the Santa copies of things like bad children, temporarily relocated family, aggressive pets, etc. It&#39;s a very sophisticated system.</p>

<p>The real issue isn&#39;t delivering the gifts, but finding the office space necessary for housing millions of elves and providing them with working satellite phone headsets. It&#39;s a nightmare for the IT department, who are thinking of unionizing in protest of poor working conditions. </p>

<p>Anyways, got a bit off topic. That&#39;s how it&#39;s done. Merry Christmas! </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Umm the answer is obvious imo. </p>

<p>Even though there&#39;s been a huge population boom since the 1900&#39;s, there&#39;s also been a mind bogglingly sharp increase in shitty children that continues to spike upwards in the 2000&#39;s, which actually results in LESS houses for Santa to visit.</p>

<p>Plus, we all know that Santa doesn&#39;t visit impoverished children, which eliminates the need to visit the homes of many countries as a whole. A few more well off cultures don&#39;t even believe in Santa, so Santa thinks they can fuck off with their shit then, no presents for them.</p>

<p>So if we focus on the most realistic route of visiting Canada, democratic states in the USA, and Britain and surrounding areas, and THEN focus on the &quot;good&quot; demographic of children&#39;s houses  to visit, Santa problem only has to visit like, 7 houses tops across two continents. Entirely doable within a 12 hour time frame considering the speed of Santa&#39;s reindeer, and factoring in timezones. </p>

<p>The real conspiracy is where are all these presents coming from in houses that Santa DOESN&#39;T visit? I bet the NSA drops presents disguised as &quot;From Santa&quot; to spy on families. At least Trump will end the NSA so we don&#39;t have to worry about children getting presents anymore amirite</p>

    <div class="md"><p>IS THERE A SANTA CLAUS???</p>

<p>As a result of an overwhelming lack of requests, and with research help from
that renown scientific journal SPY magazine (January, 1990) - We are pleased to
present the annual scientific inquiry into Santa Claus.</p>

<p>1) No known species of reindeer can fly. BUT there are 300,000 species of
living organisms yet to be classified, and while most of these are insects
and germs, this does not COMPLETELY rule out flying reindeer which only Santa
has ever seen.</p>

<p>2) There are 2 billion children (persons under 18) in the world.
BUT since Santa doesn&#39;t (appear) to handle the Muslim, Hindu, Jewish and
Buddhist children, that reduces the workload to 15% of the total - 378
million according to Population Reference Bureau. At an average (census)
rate of 3.5 children per household, that&#39;s 91.8 million homes. One presumes
there&#39;s at least one good child in each.</p>

<p>3) Santa has 31 hours of Christmas to work with, thanks to the different
time zones and the rotation of the earth, assuming he travels east to west
(which seems logical). This works out to 822.6 visits per second.
This is to say that for each Christian household with good children, Santa
has 1/1000th of a second to park, hop out of the sleigh, jump down the
chimney, fill the stockings, distribute the remaining presents under the
tree, eat whatever snacks have been left, get back up the chimney, get back
into the sleigh and move on to the next house. Assuming that each of these
91.8 million stops are evenly distributed around the earth (which, of course,
we know to be false but for the purposes of our calculations we will accept),
we are now talking about .78 miles per household, a total trip of 75-1/2
million miles, not counting stops to do what most of us must do at least once
every 31 hours, plus feeding and etc.</p>

<p>This means that Santa&#39;s sleigh is moving at 650 miles per second, 3,000
times the speed of sound. For purposes of comparison, the fastest man- made
vehicle on earth, the Ulysses space probe, moves at a poky 27.4 miles per
second - a conventional reindeer can run, tops, 15 miles per hour.</p>

<p>4) The payload on the sleigh adds another interesting element. Assuming
that each child gets nothing more than a medium-sized lego set (2 pounds),
the sleigh is carrying 321,300 tons, not counting Santa, who is invariably
described as overweight. On land, conventional reindeer can pull no more
than 300 pounds. Even granting that &quot;flying reindeer&quot; (see point #1) could
pull TEN TIMES the normal amount, we cannot do the job with eight, or even
nine. We need 214,200 reindeer. This increases the payload - not even
counting the weight of the sleigh - to 353,430 tons.
Again, for comparison - this is four times the weight of the Queen Elizabeth.</p>

<p>5) 353,000 tons traveling at 650 miles per second creates enormous air
resistance - this will heat the reindeer up in the same fashion as
spacecraft re-entering the earth&#39;s atmosphere. The lead pair of reindeer
will absorb 14.3 QUINTILLION joules of energy. Per second. Each. In short,
they will burst into flame almost instantaneously, exposing the reindeer
behind them, and create deafening sonic booms in their wake.
The entire reindeer team will be vaporized within 4.26 thousandths of a
second. Santa, meanwhile, will be subjected to centrifugal forces 17,500.06
times greater than gravity. A 250-pound Santa (which seems ludicrously slim)
would be pinned to the back of his sleigh by 4,315,015 pounds of force.</p>

<p>In conclusion - If Santa ever DID deliver presents on Christmas Eve, he&#39;s
dead now.</p>
