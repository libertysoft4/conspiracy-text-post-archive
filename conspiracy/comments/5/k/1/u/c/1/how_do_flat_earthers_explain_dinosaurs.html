    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>Margaret J. Helder continues to explain: &quot;Under what circumstances did whole organisms remain intact long enough to be fossilized? In most cases it seems, these victims were rapidly buried in great loads of sediment, which quickly hardened into rock. Not only did these situations require catastrophic burial but also the sediment involved had to be very fine grained in order for such exquisite preservation of detail to come about. Geologists generally interpret silt beds as the result of fine particles settling gradually out of still water. If that had happened in these instances, the corpses would have decayed long before burial and lithification (turning to rock) could occur.&quot;
The replacement process is supposed to involve calcium in skeletal material being replaced, atom by atom, by silica, calcite, pyrite, dolomite, etc., over a long period of time. This goes against the natural law of increasing disorder, entropy. How are all these dead atoms intelligent enough to know what to do and where to go to produce the finished fossil?</p>

<p>First of all you use the phrase &quot;dead atoms&quot; which I&#39;ve nevereverfuckingever encountered in my life. Really. Have no idea where you came up with dead atoms. Or live atoms Jesus anyway.So until that term is elucidated, everything is a cow&#39;s opinion (moooooot)</p>

<p>What? Scientist haven&#39;t found a unifying theory on how gravity and the other forces were at one point all one Super force.  Because of that scientists are unsure of what Super gravity was mathematically.  It&#39;s not that we can&#39;t witness gravity,,,,,  the moon tugs on the oceans and creates the tides.  That&#39;s witness right there if you have ever been to the ocean.</p>

<p>It&#39;s not that I&#39;m trying to check mate flat earthers as it is to get them to think about the theory they are letting out. Has it been thought out all the way thru? Does flat earth orbit the sun? Is it an explanation of computer simulation?!?! And the most annoying shit is the only people to ever comment on my serious posts are people who don&#39;t even believe it and say oh well at the end.</p>

<p>Let me get you to where I am now.
You seem intelligent so I am going to ask you are you aware of the double slit experiment and the conclusion to which it came? If you are (which I believe you are) then to get a grasp on what I believe is this: the conclusion of that experiment isn&#39;t the particle behaving as it should under observation it is behaving as the observer BELIEVES it should behave. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, I love that experiment . So much possibilities after the comprehension of YOUR power with manifestation of reality. I like to apply it to the observable universe.

    <div class="md"><p>YES</p>

<p>SO Did the story of Jesus walking on water really happen? Could Jesus walk on water because he was &quot;special&quot; or because he was &quot;supernatural&quot; or &quot;different than you or me&quot;? Well the story also told of his disciple walking on water with him (a common man) but began to sink when he seen the waves of the water because fear brings doubt - the opposite of belief or faith. For the disciple to achieve the impossible he had to believe he could which probably came from seeing Jesus doing it because for some - seeing is believing. Faith is believing without seeing. Do you think you could walk on water? I do. I think you could but only if you believed it. Society, Science, and the entire World says you cannot that it is physically impossible. If you go out to the lake now and try to walk on the water if you fail it will be because you doubt it more than you believe it. Hard to overcome the walls of belief built around our minds since birth that some things are impossible - it builds a mass prison for minds living in a place ruled over by others who are aware of the truth. </p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>

<p>YES that is a problem but you must understand what that problem is. Their belief/doubt only is a problem because it can influence your mind - and in turn influence your belief. INFLUENCE - They can tell you with words, with charts, with books, with demonstrations, and eventually they can convince your mind to believe that walking on the water of a lake is impossible - therefore for you to actually do it would lead to failure because your mind believes more that you cannot. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Jesus was the great example, not exception.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The story is one example of countless ones in history where one person achieves a goal or outcome in reality that a majority of the minds of people around them believed to be an impossibility. This is especially so when the person who achieves the impossible outcome does so by believing it will be so - believing it so blindly (faith) usually due to a burning intention of helping others. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>However if I were to tell you I could walk on water. I would purposely choose a frozen lake. So I could legitimately walk on water.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No you would be walking on frozen water which would be different - different in the fact that the entire planet believes this to be possible and therefore me and you believe it as well, there is little doubt to combat our belief of this possibility. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve always felt like flat earth was equivalent to bible speak.. Could very well be the narrative I was told, though.</p>

<p>I kinda think flat earth is ridiculous although admittedly I have no research one way or the other. The thought I have that allows me to continue without cognitive dissonance is &quot;who would profit from a lie that the earth is round when in reality, it is flat&quot;. Because the answer is no one outside of intelligence agencies looking to discredit other things by association. Just my payment to the boatman</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Wait how? If flat earth is a thing? At what point is the earth decayed? How can millions of years of evolution and orbiting around the sun and planets all of a sudden be false? I can watch Jupiter almost every night. And it will change its position through out the years. I have a telescope. And I watch the Galileo moons (?) orbit around it daily, sometimes hourly. I can track the space station, and predict when it will come around again all based on orbit predictions. </p>

<p>Simply because the earth is a massive land in comparison to us. Does not mean it is a perfect sphere. On this critical mass of matter in the shape of a sphere does not mean it is a perfect sphere. Just study any planet besides the gas giants to realize this fact. There is no evidence the earth is flat. </p>

    <div class="md"><p><em>raises hand</em>. Ummm, how do we know dinosaurs existed millions of years ago and not only thousands?  If fossils are preserved via events such as volcanic eruptions and floods, couldn&#39;t dinosaurs be totally real but misplaced in time?  Aren&#39;t there artifacts with dinosaurs on them from China and South America?  Maybe (global flood) cataclysm + hunting to extinction is what actually killed the dinosaurs.</p>

<p>Maybe they&#39;re fake.  Who knows.  I don&#39;t really give a shit.</p>

Answer / deny this:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;If the earth has been around this long, I would assume the edges would be found, or the connections of the flat earth (if there is &#39;no edge&#39;) would have altered the very obvious navigating tools such as a sexton. We wouldn&#39;t have made the latitude and longitude measurements had there not been this tool.&quot;which has been used for centuries </p>
