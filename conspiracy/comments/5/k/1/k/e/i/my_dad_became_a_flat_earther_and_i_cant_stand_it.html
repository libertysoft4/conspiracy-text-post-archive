We have no problem accepting &#39;infinity&#39; because it&#39;s conventional wisdom. Even though no one can truly grasp the concept.<br/>

Science isn&#39;t an opinion.<br/>
We make observations and record data.<br/>
Out of which we attempt to understand reality as we experience it.       </p>

It is an ever-changing representation of what humanity is able to verify to a satisfactory degree.<br/>
Even the most solid of scientific laws are just foundations built upon what we&#39;ve observed so far.<br/>
No thing can ever be known to be true. It can only be observed to be consistent for as long as it has been recorded.  </p>

<p>I have a very hard time making sense of this too.<br/>
Everything I&#39;ve ever been taught reinforces that we live on a globe. But I&#39;ve never once been shown an experiment that proves this.<br/>
I stumbled onto this insanity thinking it was just that. But there seems to be much more experimental evidence to support this theory than what we&#39;ve grew up with as &#39;fact&#39;.<br/>
I have no idea what to think now.<br/>
But the deeper I look, and more evidence I uncover, the more unsure I am of everything I thought I knew.      </p>

And I watch the Galileo moons (?) orbit around Jupiter nightly, sometimes hourly. I can <a href="https://spotthestation.nasa.gov/sightings/">track the space station</a> and it&#39;s really freaking amazing to see( I dare you to track it and watch it for yourself in real life). It looks like a UFO, and predict when it will come around again all based on orbital predictions. </p>

<p>Simply because the earth is a massive land in comparison to us. Does not mean it is a perfect sphere. On this matter of mass in the shape of a sphere orbiting other spheres does not mean it is a perfect sphere down to miles of distance being completely accurate and areas that are not sphereical that exist. Just study any rocky planet besides the obvious gas giants to realize this fact. There is no evidence the earth is flat. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I am not a flat earther by any means. However, I can admit some of the evidence is intriguing and worth a look at the very least. </p>

<p>I have a couple pics I took that I can share. I took these at 12:30pm a couple weeks ago, in the first is the moon, in the second is the sun. I stood in the same place and faced the same direction to take the pics. The extent of my movement was turning my head from the right, to the left. Meaning the sun and moon were both visible and on the same side of earth. </p>

<p>My question is; how can the moon have a shadow when the sun isn&#39;t behind the earth to cast the shadow? I&#39;m genuinely curious and welcome any explanations. Also, the moon finally disappeared from the sky around 1pm, but was back in the sky a mere 5 hours later. How does that work? </p>

<p>I have a video as well to show that the photos aren&#39;t faked and that all I did was pan right to left but I can&#39;t get it to upload. I will keep trying and will edit this comment if I get it to work. </p>

<p>Again, I am not a flat earther, but I&#39;m definitely a little puzzled and welcome any opinion from those smarter than I on the topic. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Tell your father about polar nights. </p>

<p>A polar night occurs when the night lasts for more than 24 hours. This occurs only inside the polar circles.The opposite phenomenon, the polar day, or midnight sun, occurs when the Sun stays above the horizon for more than 24 hours. &quot;Night&quot; is understood as the center of the Sun being below a free horizon. Since the atmosphere bends the rays of the Sun, the polar day is longer than the polar night, and the area that is affected by polar night is somewhat smaller than the area of midnight sun. The polar circle is located at a latitude between these two areas, at the latitude of approximately 66.5 degrees. In the most northern city of Sweden, Kiruna, at 67°51&#39;N, the polar night lasts for around 28 twenty-four-hour periods, while the midnight sun lasts around 50 twenty-four-hour periods. </p>
