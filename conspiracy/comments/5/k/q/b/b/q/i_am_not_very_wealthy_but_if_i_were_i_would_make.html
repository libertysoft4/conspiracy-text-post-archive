    <div class="md"><p>I suggest searching the benefits of home birth/ birth center over hospital birth. 
Overall, from my personal experience, we had our baby at a birth center with midwives. Midwives are certified medical professionals. Most were nurses in hospitals beforehand. They didn&#39;t try to pressure us into things we weren&#39;t comfortable with. The experience as a whole was very easy (as these things go) and quite mellow. Also, hospitals are full of sick people, babies have are all but helpless with weaker immune systems. For us it just seemed like the more logical/spiritual choice. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Pain killers like epidurals and things of that nature. Also ultrasounds and sonic imaging. As a species we don&#39;t truly understand how sounds can effect us, especially in utero. A natural birth and skin to skin contact with the mother is crucial. I&#39;m not saying being born in a hospital will kill your babies, obviously medicine has its place. But I think during the birthing process medical intervention should be used only if required. </p>

<p>To see this for yourself take a heroic dose of halucinagines on a cloudless night while Saturn is visible in the sky. Your entire reality will move and shift (including other planets and stars) but Saturn will stay stationary. </p>

<p>This is incorrect.  The only truth i have is what i decide it to be.  I have absolute authority over my own truth.  Sometimes i like to share it for the sake of discussion.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>When you speak of your own truth, this is a whole other phylosophical subject which I would agree to discuss for hours with you, but I believe that there is such a thing as ABSOLUTE truth. Let me demonstrate: If I was to drop my laptop on the floor in front of you, you could argue that you have the right to believe that it didn&#39;t fall, but in the end, it did fall. Now if you want to go into the discussion of &quot;it&#39;s all about perspective and my experience&quot; I am willing to entertain the idea and discuss for hours. My point is that you do not KNOW anything except that you exist (Rene Descartes) and everything else is beliefs. some are extremely strong beliefs, like the fact that you believe that the pants you are wearing exist physically or that the sun will rise tomorrow like it did yesterday but at a metaphysical level, these are just beliefs.

    <div class="md"><p>If i should address 2 and 3 then i would say the following:</p>

<p>First, i have not looked too deeply into either of these subjects, so i retain the right to plead temporary ignorance.  The reason I have not looked deeply is that they simply seemed less important.</p>

<p>So, if Bill Hicks became Alex Jones, to what end?  Is he really fooling authority? Fooling us?  I just fail to see the importance of the connection.  Bill died by the government or other.  Why fake this?</p>

<p>For 3:</p>

<p>I am studying this surge of media regarding social (sjw) and transgender issues.  </p>

<p>I suppose the idea is the war on the male.  The idea is to use language to divide identities into so many categories the they are all diluted.  The strong male is feminized as a result and the population in general slowly shifts away from a high testosterone quotient.</p>

<p>I guess in some ways it wouldn&#39;t surprise me at this point if they were trans.  If they actually came out about it i suppose I might be more interested.</p>

<p>Absolute truth? Perhaps? As a shared experience with another to confirm it.  Scientific method and all that.  Gather independently verifiable facts, or absolute truths, if you will, from different sources.  Otherwise it&#39;s just a daily hallucination or simulation.</p>

<p>You are obviously not a troll and probably someone who is just looking for some truth in this world of lies and disinformation. </p>

<p>For #2, I looked at some facts and it seemed pretty convincing, so I started spreading the info; to my surprise, I was instantly downvoted into oblivion...makes you wonder. Actually, it&#39;s pretty obvious that AJ can send his henchmans to downvote any info on AJ=BH. Not I care that much, AJ is a gate keeper; he tells some truth and has awaken a ton of people, but he tries to sell his shitty stuff and poison the air wave with carefully engineered lies. </p>

<p>For #3, I like that you at least entertain the idea. What if I was to tell you that some of the most famous male celebs were born women? Think big league celebs. Were talking about Brad Pitt, Leonardo Dicaprio, Michael Jackson, Prince, Michael Moore, Bob Marley...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Man will have trouble swallowing this one because they have had sexual desires for these &quot;women&quot; and now that they are exposed for what they are, the brain does all kinds of gymnastics to refuse the idea that you actually had homosexual desires.

<p>I&#39;m not saying there could or might not be a penis hidden there or had been one there in the past. Just not the same as homosexual desire, like you said.</p>

<p>You are obviously not a troll and probably someone who is just looking for some truth in this world of lies and disinformation. </p>

<p>For #2, I looked at some facts and it seemed pretty convincing, so I started spreading the info; to my surprise, I was instantly downvoted into oblivion...makes you wonder. Actually, it&#39;s pretty obvious that AJ can send his henchmans to downvote any info on AJ=BH. Not I care that much, AJ is a gate keeper; he tells some truth and has awaken a ton of people, but he tries to sell his shitty stuff and poison the air wave with carefully engineered lies. </p>

<p>For #3, I like that you at least entertain the idea. What if I was to tell you that some of the most famous male celebs were born women? Think big league celebs. Were talking about Brad Pitt, Leonardo Dicaprio, Michael Jackson, Prince, Michael Moore, Bob Marley...</p>
