    <div class="md"><p>&quot;The ends justify the means&quot; is a mantra for marxists. Meaning they will lie about political allegences. They will say whatever or do whatever with the only conviction and creed being the gaining of power. Regardless of what ends they want, the means are always justified to these people. The truth is intentions do not matter, it&#39;s the consequences. Marxists believe their intentions take superiority and if the means are evil ultimately the good end will outweigh it.</p>

<p>Hillary refers to this as &quot;making hard choices&quot; &quot;tough decisions&quot;. They basically are telling people we need to do immoral things and because I have no conscience I&#39;m going to look at it with cold hard logic. A machine and sociopaths operate off of logic. A human being with a sense of morals uses reason and compassion.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>They are Marxists insofar that it serves their interest. She probably doesn&#39;t give a shit about utopian visions but Marx&#39;s ideas along with subsequent followers who branched off his philosophy, are using his ideas. The main book of tactics they utilize is Rules for Radicals by Saul Alinsky. Clinton also did her dissertation on Alinsky and Marx.</p>

<p>When I think of a capitalist I think of someone who does actual business and trade. Not a opportunistic politician that extorts, bribes and kills her way to the top. Just because she is rich doesn&#39;t make her a capitalist. Also capitalism is not an ideology, it&#39;s simply a description of trade and property. It&#39;s an &quot;ism&quot; but not a ideological &quot;ism.&quot; Capitalism is a natural process, even in places where capitalism is made illegal black markets still pop up like in North Korea.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Animals constantly trade and create mutually beneficial relationships. Trade is seen outside of humanity. Trade is how species coexist. When they can&#39;t, they fight.</p>

<p>Bastiat&#39;s The Law says when trade ceases warfare begins. Trade is the natural process, just like evolution, for a organism to coalesce with the enviroment.
I could see Hillary being fascist which isn&#39;t a far offshoot from neo-con. By the way I subscribe to the horseshoe theory of politics. Marxism and fascism are extremes and they aren&#39;t much different from one another and eventually either way devolves into an authoritarian dictatorship.
If you still see the political positions on a straight line of left/right you&#39;ll probably think I&#39;m an idiot.</p>

<p>Look at Trumps time with the reform party. He has been saying the same things for years. He isn&#39;t a fascist. Shit he was working with Jesse Ventura for a while in the political world. Also how hard is it for a candidate to talk positively about helping businesses and not sound &quot;corporatist&quot;? See the thing is Trump doesn&#39;t advocate to hold one business up over another. Corporatism picks winners and losers. Trump wants to create a economic enviroment that encourages businesses to prosper this is just good governance. The rhetoric of these two positions can almost sound exactly the same, but it&#39;s a world of difference in terms of consequences.</p>

<p>Israel is a heavily right-wing country in terms of their politicians.  They depend on right-wing America for their existence.  Everyone thinks it&#39;s liberals because Jews tend to be socially liberal.  Their international politics, however, are hardcore right-wing and isolationist.</p>

<p>The right-wing/nationalist dream to &quot;glass&quot; the Middle East hinges on the existence of a strong and resistant Israel.  </p>

<p>I think you&#39;re just now realizing how much your movement has been taken over by anti-Muslim extremism.</p>

The WUJS represents 1.5 million Jewish students, worldwide.

<p>When I think of a capitalist I think of someone who does actual business and trade. Not a opportunistic politician that extorts, bribes and kills her way to the top. Just because she is rich doesn&#39;t make her a capitalist. Also capitalism is not an ideology, it&#39;s simply a description of trade and property. It&#39;s an &quot;ism&quot; but not a ideological &quot;ism.&quot; Capitalism is a natural process, even in places where capitalism is made illegal black markets still pop up like in North Korea.</p>
