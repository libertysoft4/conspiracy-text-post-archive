    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s like this. The corruption in DC is so entrenched and systemic, it will be no easy task for anyone trying to drain the swamp. Maybe Trump was a con job, but we should give him the benefit of the doubt until at least his first hundred days are up. It is very difficult to know what kind of Machiavellian machinations are being employed by both sides, but the last thing we need to do is ingest these endless fucking black pills being put out daily by the corporate press. I know this community is basically addicted to cynicism, even if it is usually justified. Let&#39;s see how this shakes out before we assumin&#39; all is lost and pouring ashes on our heads.</p>

<p>Pretending the truth isn&#39;t the truth just because it&#39;s in the mainstream press is <em>stupid</em> ... and Trump&#39;s growing list of insider appointments is the truth.

    <div class="md"><p>Mnuchin hasn&#39;t worked for Goldman in like 14 years, and Goldman is private.  The are not part of the US government.  Just because they have influence in DC does not mean they are not private.</p>

<p>There is always a possibility of corruption within the government, but you are operating under the assumption that past associations mean that Mnuchin, or whoever else, is automatically corrupt.  The fact of the matter is that Trump is not in office yet.  His cabinet has done nothing, so it seem to me that you would be complaining about this no matter who Trump picked, and you will continue to complain no matter what happens in the future.</p>

<p>They have, but I would argue that the government is most at fault.  They made the laws, and they ignored the repeated warnings that the housing bubble was about to pop.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Maybe Trump believes they&#39;ll do what is good for the country rather than what is good for their former employers.  Maybe he&#39;ll replace them if he finds he was wrong about that.  Until we see what Trump allows these people to do, there&#39;s no reason for a former Trump supporter to declare that he&#39;s changed his agenda based solely on his cabinet choices.</p>

<p>I too suspect that a lot of Trump&#39;s decisions will be mistakes, as he was, after all, merely the lesser of two evils, but I can wait to see the effects of his decisions before I criticize him for causing those effects.

<p>That would be preferable to putting active climate science deniers in charge of environmental agencies.</p>

<p>Is this a joke? He&#39;s <em>explicitly stated</em> that he denies climate science. He&#39;s spent much of his career <em>suing the organization that he will now be the head of</em>, for their regulations to combat global warming. Every time the EPA has put forth policies to curtail the emissions of greenhouse gasses, he sued.</p>

<p>If you have even done a cursory amount of research into this then you would know it.</p>

<p>So not only are you saying, &quot;What you guys are saying doesn&#39;t matter because you&#39;ll bitch no matter what.&quot; But you&#39;re saying this <em>while not even having basic knowledge of the things people are complaining about.</em></p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Of course not. But combatting climate change costs effort and money. Limiting carbon emissions, even if it is good for the entire planet, is a cost to the people who have to limit these emissions. </p>

<p>This is literally one of the main reasons why the government exists. To help balance your personal costs, which you care about, with the costs your actions have on everyone else or on the planet, which you personally might not care about as much.</p>

<p>Not doing this encourages you to act without regard for how your actions incur costs to everyone else, and if everyone does this it can be a bad thing.</p>

<p>Trump doesn&#39;t want to heat the planet up to flood the world out of spite, but he does want to reduce costs to energy producers by making them not have to care about how their actions incur costs to the environment via global warming.</p>

<p>He&#39;s not doing it with the purpose to further global warming. But his actions will, almost undoubtedly, further global warming.</p>

<p>No one wants to cause global warming. People do shit that causes it because doing so furthers their own interests.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, not really. If somebody is talking about global warming, they are usually talking about global warming. If somebody is talking about keeping the environment clean, that includes (or should include) global warming too (since global warming occurs mainly because of pollution).

<p>Ofc I would say it, because that isn&#39;t an argument for or against preventing global warming. &quot;We should save the tiger from extinction&quot;, &quot;No, I don&#39;t like cats anyway&quot;. It&#39;s just stupid.</p>

<p>Because this is a post about Trump and in every comment I&#39;ve seen from you you are trying to protect his policies/ideas. Keeping the environment clean should be common sense, not something that you do because you want to reap benefits. Right now, humanity is like a disease to this planet, slowly killing it.

Grow the fuck up. Your hypocrisy is showing. Try some of that critical thinking and figure out why you are even arguing.

<p>But you&#39;re not being skeptical of mainstream media. You&#39;re completely distrusting it, out of hand. Which is just as bad as completely trusting it out of hand.</p>

<p>If you were skeptical of it and thought critically about it, you wouldn&#39;t say bullshit like the fact that they criticize Trump is inherently evidence that Trump&#39;s actions should not be criticized or that he&#39;s &quot;what we need&quot;.</p>

<p>Being cynical is not being skeptical. And you&#39;ve clearly confused the two.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Alright, so, problem.</p>

<p>The first source in the article is an NYT article written Dec. 13th which is mainly complaining that </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Under its chief executive, Rex W. Tillerson, the giant oil company sidestepped Baghdad and Washington, signing a deal directly with the Kurdish administration in the country’s north. The move undermined Iraq’s central government, strengthened Kurdish independence ambitions and contravened the stated goals of the United States.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>While it may be helpful to the gov.&#39;s foreign policy to have companies that fall in line, those companies are under no obligation to do so. As long as they are not side-stepping lawful sanctions, they are allowed to do whatever they want.</p>

<p>Again, I&#39;m not saying there&#39;s not anything here worth looking at.</p>

<p>I&#39;d also like to point out that your source, The Quartz, is owned by the Atlantic Media Group (publications including The Atlantic, Quartz, Government Executive, Defense One). The owner,  David G. Bradley, promised to keep the offices of <em>The Atlantic</em> in Boston when he bought the outlet, but then moved it to Washington D.C. soon after. <em>The Atlantic</em> is also criticized for</p>

<blockquote>
<p>hosting off-the-record, corporation-sponsored salons.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This comes from an article in <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/personal/archive/2009/07/wapo-salons-sell-access-to-lobbyists/20535/">The Atlantic</a> itself.</p>

<p>Not necessarily true. But it&#39;s certainly worth questioning.</p>

<p>When I look at how the Founding Fathers laid the groundwork for the federal government, I get the impression that they never intended it to be a place of &#39;career politicians&#39;. In other words, you would run for office, and once your term expired, go back to doing whatever else you want to do.</p>

<p>I think one of the sources of the perceived disconnect between politicians and their constituents is that these guys get into office, go to D.C. and return once every couple of years to do a couple of campaign fundraisers.</p>

<p>I support congressional term limits for that reason.</p>

Well, no shit, but it&#39;s not about changing anything since your vote to the Reps or Dems won&#39;t change anything either. It&#39;s about showing that you aren&#39;t happy with the current system, if more people did this it MIGHT change something in the long run. Voting for establishment parties won&#39;t change anything for sure.</p>

<p>But nice logic you have there &#39;Voting for 3rd party candidates won&#39;t change anything. The establishment parties are run by corporations, and the system doesn&#39;t allow anything else than the two parties. Whelp, let&#39;s just vote for one of the two parties, which sure as hell won&#39;t change anything either.&#39;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s what the news does...they report on claims non-stop. I don&#39;t like it, but that&#39;s how it works. A part of this particular case was that it involved information that only the Bush administration was privy to. It&#39;s hard to debunk something when you don&#39;t have the means to investigate yourself until after the fact.</p>

<p>hes got a republican majority everywhere hes got to fill the spots with some one and after that campaign does any one expect him to invite democrats in?</p>

<p>politics is an influence peddling game, the appointments are always used to buy favours, to expect him to not be able to play that game is imo pretty silly.</p>

<p>i think the media had their noses figuritivly rubbed in their own shit over the election so they are still just bitter and hate on him for that as well.</p>

<p>the reality is we have no idea what to expect from this guy, hes never held office, and hes been a media figure for longer than many of us have been alive, we won&#39;t know where he is steering the ship until at least 6 months in.</p>

<p>i do have some serious concerns on his stance with israel.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s correct, but it also appears to be the reason for Trump avoiding Intelligence Briefings, if you ask me. It would seem that he&#39;s not too trusting of the MI-Complex and prefers his own sources.</p>

<p>Now depending on your perception of Trump&#39;s intelligence and rigor, that might be an admirable or a foolish decision, but I think it&#39;s too early for us to judge.</p>

<p>That seems to be the crux of this whole debate to me. It&#39;s too early to judge one way or the other.

<p>Look you fucking lemmings, you wanna know what the black pill is? Look at this sub. Look at /pol/. Look at any forum that bothers discussing politics and history. They&#39;re either compromised or fighting for dear life to keep solidarity. You fuckers can&#39;t keep it cool and mitigate shilling and take action. Pizzagate was the best thing to happen for our ilk because it unified our folks while shining light on the most damning and sickening thing we can all rally against to expose.</p>

<p>But lo and behold, now that pizzagate is dying down, everyone reverts back to being assblasted partisans. I can&#39;t believe there are people bitching about Trump over something as contentious as &quot;climate change&quot; while children are getting face fucked in some millionaires rape dungeon. Fuck you and your fucking libshit crocodile tears. There are children getting raped and smuggled around the world by very influential and connected people. I THINK THATS CONCERNING, DONT YOU.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t care that Trump picked some seedy shekel to be his treasurer or that were not getting our promises. What did you think was going to fucking happen. It&#39;s Washington politics -- a fugazi in of itself. What matters is that people quit being egotistical, be open to information, investigate, work together, and help bring justice. </p>

<p>Honestly, what&#39;s missing is the mindset of our great great grandparents. Coal miners, rail road workers, etc. Tough men and women who wouldn&#39;t think twice to incessantly protest and fight if they were double crossed by an authority figure. Virtually everyone bitches and goes back to jerking off and watching Netflix. It&#39;s a laughing stock. </p>

<p>My favorite parts of this are two tweets by Mr. Donald J. Trump after Obama&#39;s reelection in 2012:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>He (<em>Obama</em>) lost the popular vote by a lot and won the election.  We should have a revolution in this country!</p>

<p>More votes equals a loss...revolution!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Interesting.  So, Mr. Trump, you feel the popular vote is more important than the electoral college?  Okie dokie.</p>

<p>Every politician is a liar, first, last, and always.  Bush is a liar.  Obama is a liar.  Trump is a liar.  Shillary is a liar.  The sooner you idiots that fell for his schtick realize this, the sooner we can get back to digging for the truth through the shit, piss, and muck that corporate media, the lobby groups, and our gov&#39;t shovel at us.  Until then, please stop acting like those who don&#39;t worship at the feet of the Cheeto king are somehow complicit with a conspiracy to deny a billionaire a public platform for the further profitability of his own and other billionaire&#39;s already bloated fortunes on the backs of the working class.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What scares me most is it is subconscious attacks. </p>

<p>They are attempting to stir resentment within the human psyche; 
as if to call in on the lone wolves that need just enough to formulate an attack. Muslims; He is going to kick you out; Now he is hiring the bankers; (they did the initial slams via us media) then use the subliminal messaging to push people into a deep state of resentment;
If I were trump I&#39;d send a decoy into the tower and literally vacation off radar until the 20th; Holding the inauguration in a non biased state like Ohio; This rise up movement appears to be the DNC Not my president movement; Rise up formerly being BLM Associated; Almost how ISIS was formed; It is truly as if they have segregated the weakest minds via fear tactics to call on them for support in the election; Now that they have lost they are attempting to use them as an army of dissidents against the Trump administration in its lead to take office. </p>

<p>Firstly Trump is a good dude; He is literally a top notch citizen and an amazing father; He holds american traditions and values up higher then prioritization and corporate agenda; Hes taken the wolves by their reigns, and insured that those that need to be on leashes are on the tightest of leashes he can muster. The saying is that you keep your friends close and your enemies closer is exactly what I see him doing; This isn&#39;t to go against the people; This is a tactic to hold those important to the people fully accountable for their future actions by forcing them to work for him; </p>

<p>I see a smart chess player and an honorable man; I truly feel this is nothing more than a last minute run for freedom by the criminal as we know her HRC. Whose obviously abused her power as sec of state. Embarrassed herself and now our Nation in her federal investigation; While attempting every trick in the book to cheat us out of our choice in president; Going as far as blaming the results of her failed campaign on Russia itself. </p>

<p>Like people wake the F up. If you destroyed evidence in a federal court case; You would be dog meat in a grinder; Used to feed pigs. 
If you possessed classified materials illegally and multiple documents at that you would be kissing your families good by for good measure; And had you funded a terrorist regime as they are now reporting; You would be walking to the gallows; Do not pass go; Do not collect 200 dollars; So is this the devil in Prada; Yes</p>

<p>Don&#39;t let someone else get away with what you couldn&#39;t. Your words are important; Instead of chanting not my president in some obviously pushed DNC narrative programming the masses to dissent against an american legacy and ICON. Why don&#39;t you take your real power and push for equality with a new message. Just three simple words; Which you all should know exactly what they mean in their entirety...</p>

<p>LOCK..</p>

<p>HER...</p>

<p>UP!</p>

<p>Seriously guys. If reddit could do anything. We can repeat that on every forum and thread; And For once be proud that we did something for the history books; Something for our nation; and something for the world itself; </p>

<p>Or be pawns of us media; Get a freaking patriot to take a knee and leave our country to the wolves; Because seriously if you don&#39;t open your eyes now; That is exactly what is going to happen... </p>

<p>And special thanks to Putin for being a patient saint in this not falling for the games of the DNC and their b.s. narrative. 
I personally respect him more, based on his actions alone!</p>

<p>Why do you keep telling me how to think?  First you tell me to remove myself from the game, basically don&#39;t vote. Hillary fanatics were saying that a lot on this sub during the elections. Then you say I have a choice and that I am letting someone choose for me by thinking I don&#39;t have a choice.</p>

<p>Your circular logic is not productive. I had a choice and I CHOSE TRUMP.  He was my choice. I liked what he said and how he looked at things. I disregarded all the propaganda and chose. It was a very easy choice with the criminal Hillary running against him.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If the president orders a nuclear launch, can anyone stop him?</p>

<p>Presumably, by the time the POTUS got into that position, they gained the scruples not to launch a needless nuclear annihilation of another nation.  That said, there&#39;s a chain of command that involves the Secretary of Defense who could refuse to relay the order (his codes —or those of the Asst. Sec. Defense in his absence— are required to launch) and then quickly call the Cabinet and Congress to report that the POTUS had gone crazy. The Cabinet can declare the President unfit in a letter to Congress.</p>

<p>Furthermore, there&#39;s a &quot;must notify&quot; part of the nuclear protocol that requires the DoD and whomever else inside the White House to notify senior leaders of the US government in the event of a nuclear launch.  These leaders would include (and presumably not be limited to), Speaker of the House, President Pro Temp of the Senate, Majority/Minority Leaders of both houses of Congress, the Chairperson of the various oversight committees that are tied to war (Appropriations, Defense, Intelligence, Energy).  The chain of command, that requires the Secretary of Defense and others to relay such an order is robust enough to handle such a statistically-impossible scenario of a &quot;rogue president&quot; ordering a launch.</p>
