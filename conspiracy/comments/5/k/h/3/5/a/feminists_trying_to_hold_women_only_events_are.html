<p>Our fascist overlords want to destroy the strongest bond on earth:  the erotic bond between man and woman.  Transgenderism is a full frontal assault on that bond, and consequently on marriage and family.  </p>

<p>The importance of family has been mocked so much by our controlled media that it sounds radical to say it, but the family IS the building block of society.  We destroy it at our peril. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Marriage has always been bullshit and until romanticism had little or nothing to do with love. </p>

<p>Family is no building block to anything, humans are incredibly versatile. We can be raised by fucking wolves and still adapt and survive adequately. The adage &quot;it takes a village to raise a child&quot; isn&#39;t random, it&#39;s based on documented cases throughout history where children were not raised solely by a mother and father, and if you were rich you were lucky enough not to deal with the little fucks.</p>

<p>So many of these &quot;love and family&quot; ideologues happen to have affairs and are shitty parents in the same way some politicians who oppose same sex marriage or gay rights also fuck men. At its core these sort of rigid ideologies are narcissistic and egotistical, they satiate an innate desire to feel good about oneself, only at any expense. Cognitive dissonance and compartmentalization play a role too. </p>

<p>In nature, homosexuality and transexualism benefit the species because they increase the amount of viable parents of both maternal and paternal instinct, without limiting them by genitalia. More parents, more surviving children. Gender and sexuality don&#39;t matter, both are wide spectrums that can vary at the drop of a dime based on something as seemingly disconnected as culture. Human sexuality has NEVER been rigid except when culture demanded it. We also thought it was totally awesome that our leaders fuck kids and the varying perspectives on prostitution alone should give you an idea of how culture impacts sexuality.</p>

<p>Do you honestly think it is better for an orphaned child to live without parents when there are perfectly loving and upstanding people willing to adopt them, just because those people are gay? This has never made sense to me and there is absolutely no tangible evidence, scientific or even anecdotal, to support it.    </p>

<p>What it means to be man or woman has little to do with genitalia. The actual characteristics of gender are regulated by hormones, both pre and post birth. The brain of a homosexual or transexual individual is more likely to resemble the brain of someone of the opposite sex. I&#39;m interested in the theory that environmental estrogen has much to do with how our gender is determined these days.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Woman are acting more like males and men more like females. No offense, but this also explains why many girls choose immigrants instead of whites (north america and western europe whites (i do not include eastern european whites)). Because they act more like a male used to act, take the decisions, raise the voice more often, get angry more easily for small things, acts more like a leader, etc. I know it may sound stupid in 2016, but primitive hormones dont follow the callendar. As long as i have known, sweet boyfriends get dumped more quickly and more often compared to others.</p>
