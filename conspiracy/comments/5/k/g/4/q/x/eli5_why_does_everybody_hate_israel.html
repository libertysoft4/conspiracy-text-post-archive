<p>If you read closely, the bible makes it clear that all of the Kingdom of Israel (Jacob had 12 sons) were the chosen people. When Jeroboam split the kingdom into north and south, the 3 tribes (Judah, Levi and Benjamin) that made up the southern kingdom became what are known today as Jews.</p>

<p>The northern kingdom (ever hear of the lost 10 tribes?) were carried away to Assyria and only a small remnant ever returned to Judea.</p>

<p>as it stands, all of Israel/12 sons of Jacob are His chosen</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ok, let&#39;s say that&#39;s true. Let&#39;s say for example that these people represent the one and only God. </p>

<p>Is killing people, running all the central banks,  manipulating currencies, lies, deceit, land grabs, corporate manipulation, etc the representation of a good and holy kind and loving God? Not a God I want to believe in.</p>

<p>Like I said, I judge people on their actions. Not books that have been transcribed over and over and over to fit the agendas of kings and Queens for centuries. By that logic the Nazis should be listened to as well. They firmly believed they were the master race. Guess what? They&#39;re not. </p>

<p>If the Jews want the title of the chosen ones and want to represent God, then earn the damn title. They&#39;re not going to earn it by corrupting and buying politicians and creating tons of propaganda. </p>

<p>Do you have any idea how many Jews funded Hilter? Lots. Jews killing Jews. So sad.</p>

<p>People need to practice what they preach. Killing and lying and manipulating in the name of God is blasphemous in any religion.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So lets get this straight, you&#39;re going to blame an entire religion on the actions of a few that do not follow values of said religion.</p>

<p>In Judaism murder is illegal, letting your fellow jew die is illegal, cheating people is illegal. I hear all this talk about these jewish bankers that rule the world, but by their actions they are not jewish at all.</p>

<p>Stop being a racist/antisemitic twat and learn not to judge the many by the actions of the few, because every country/ group of people has someone with dirt on their hands.</p>
