    <div class="md"><p>Yeah the universe is expanding. I guess the light from these galaxies takes so long to get to us that we are seeing photons that have traveled millions of years and eventually if we are separating faster than light from the galaxy it will eventually disappear from the sky.

    <div class="md"><p>Light is mass, photon.  Thus, could it be that in the medium between galaxies, light (too) can travel faster than light (via space expansion) + regular speed of light?  Maybe it only goes the rate of space expansion but continues at light speed once it gets into our relative area?  I think it&#39;d have to be a combo-effect.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well according to the article we can see these galaxies in our sky because the light that is hitting our eyes has travelled millions of years to reach us and made the trip back when space was expanding much slower. Space expansion has accelerated and it seems to be pushing us away from galaxies at faster than the speed of light meaning most of the lights in the sky we see that are galaxies will one day no longer burn for us as the light eventually cannot over come the speed of expansion to reach us. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>No... most people here arent understanding this correctly at all. Space is expanding at every point in the universe. So, yes we are moving faster than light speed relative to another far galaxy, which means we can never see it because the light will never reach us. But we aren&#39;t moving light speed or over at all. </p>

<p>The way it&#39;s generally explained in layman&#39;s terms is take an uninflated balloon, draw dots on it a centimeter apart, and the blow it up. The dots further away from each other are increasing distance faster than one&#39;s closer together.</p>

<p>No laws of physics are violated because it&#39;s space its self that&#39;s expanding. Light speed is only a limit on how fast you can travel through space.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My understanding is that space-time itself is just expanding at a rate faster than light. No object is moving &quot;in&quot; space-time quicker than c, but the distance between objects a and b are just increasing. The speed of light is the speed limit for objects in space-time.</p>

<p>We don&#39;t know why this is and may ultimately be the key to manipulating space time in order to travel great distances. We are smart enough to know that simply producing a high velocity is not enough. We will ultimately need to manipulate space-time itself in order to travel some great distances within a reasonable time frame (I.e. shorter than the lifespan of a human)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you fire a bullet out of a gun and it goes 200mph then you stand on a train that&#39;s going 60mph and fire the same bullet the bullet goes 260mph. Light travels at the speed of light which is the universal speedlight. Shining the light while on top of a moving train going 60mph doesn&#39;t mean the light travels lightspeed + 60mph. It simply travels lightspeed and no faster.</p>

<p>So if we are traveling through space faster than light how can light shine in the same direction were traveling from a flashlight? It can&#39;t</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Take your flashlight out and shine it all around at the ceiling and walls. If you were traveling in a direction at the greater than the speed of light at least in one direction your light would emit nothing as the photons cannot travel faster than that speed.

    <div class="md"><p>Correct but our galaxy is not traveling through space at faster than light speeds, it&#39;s sitting in a section of a growing universe. Space is expanding and all neighboring galaxies are moving farther away from us but in all directions that we observe they are all moving farther away. It&#39;s not that milky way and adromedia are both going one way - it&#39;s that all galaxies around us in all directios are moving away meaning space is expanding us or the galaxies aren&#39;t necessarily travelling along at the speed it seems the galaxies are leaving at. </p>

<p>yes it is, depending on your definition of &#39;traveling through space&#39;</p>

<p>My definition is your on an object in a galaxy that is traversering across space from point a to point b - just the same as being in a rocket traversing through space. If you were traveling faster than light in one direction than your flashlight would not shine a light onto the wall of your house in the direction we are traveling. Because we are not traveling from point a to point b we are still in point a while our neighboring galaxy is also still in point a. The growth of space is expanding between us at a rate that makes us observe our neighbor galaxy travelling away from us at faster than light speed even though they are not traveling at all</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Time would slow relative to another place that isn&#39;t traveling at the speed of light so you wouldn&#39;t really notice a difference time wise... but we aren&#39;t traveling faster than light - the distance/space between us and neighboring galaxies is expanding so rapidly that we distance from them seemingly at this speed.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If we are traveling faster than light it would appear as we are stationary and the world around us has been slowed in time. Not quite slowed to the point of stationary. But slowed in movement. So time is bending around us because we in our very nature break the time barrier, and experience a slowed time dimension as a reality .</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, I am saying you, your being, surpasses the light barrier and the reality you perceive is slowed in time. Look around your room, it bends as your focus moves in and out. When you look one way, the other way blurs out of focus. So our perception is able to sense what we move our attention on and slow it in time so we can then perceive it.</p>

<p>But practice looking sideways. The chair you are sitting on. The matter has been slowed so you can sit on it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah but relative to what? If I am traveling at near the speed in a spaceship my clock still ticks the same as say your clock if your on earth it&#39;s just that IF you could observe my clock with a telescope as I flew by it would appear to be moving super super slow compared to yours. So maybe 5 minutes on my clock would take you 5 years to witness happen. Relativity...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s exactly what I&#39;m saying.  We do it automatically, but we can also slow down our attention to analyze the process. We are amazing.</p>

<p>So it&#39;s also that our consciousness is both faster than light and slowed to experience it.. And we can also perceive probabilities because of this.. Because since reality is just a slowing down, you can mentally speed it up to see how one thing will lead to another, and plan an experience. So whatever choice you were to make would lead to an experience. This is how we bend time and plan a reality by moving forward through it.</p>

<p>Other realities move backwards in time. Just for comparison. But this ability to surpass time can also make us the controllers of our own destiny by better understanding how to manipulate it.</p>

<p>It&#39;s bendable. It can slow or speed depending on you.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Read it a few more times, you pretty much right its almost a common sense realization. Its possible then that consciousness is also space expanding as collectively, individually ours is.... giving us this ability heading towards the end of time meaning shedding entropy? Maybe went a little too far there.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It does seem common sense, when Einstein both explains time and relativity and then also observers role, he didn&#39;t know that the human perception was this reason for it all. Maybe he did or didn&#39;t really believe it.  Couldn&#39;t mathematically deduce source consciousness and what it doing. Even though we live in it, and ourelvs make it complex to understand, who is to say it&#39;s not simple. Since its our perception, we can shift it. By believing different ideas. Take God for example, we attribute all of this power to God, who is just a believed in perception. Why not shift the ability to ourselves?  </p>

<p>Our technology coupled with an expanded awareness is going to accelerate us to that shifted perception. But where we place our power has to shift, so that includes who we have as any authority over us. Because essentially each of us is God, and we don&#39;t really need a higher power than that.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So then let&#39;s say spacetime is expanding so rapidly now that physical galaxies seem they are achieving the impossible (travelling away from us faster than light) when we know they are not travelling at all. </p>

<p>This would be as above so below as a galaxy would represent physical matter separate from consciousness(spacetime) not capable of performing what spacetime is actively achieving at the moment. Where our bodies(galaxies - physical matter) exist within slowed time our minds(unseen matter - spacetime) are rapidly expanding beyond phyiscal possibilities being able to perceive events faster than they occur therefore proving we can determine future events by consciously seeing choices of physical bodily actions. </p>

<p>As general relativity has yet to mesh with quantum mechanics for a unified theory it may show us that :</p>

<p>Achieving enlightenment may be the marriage of the physical mind(the body and the bodies actions we don&#39;t control blood pressure white and red cells hormones etc) to unite with the conscious infinite mind to create a physical looking vessel that can exist in the presence of physical beings existing in vibration (or time) but enlightened ones who shed the physicality by overcome barriers of belief to produce a unified body/mind that has transcended beyond the highest vibrational frequency of physical reality which would be non-vibratrional or faster than lightspeed aka all points of the journey from a to b at once. Which would be in all moments of time at once perceiving all moments of present at once in at all places. The physical existence may perceive an enlightened ones next steps within the mind but the body has yet to catch up and witness it, whereas the enlightened one is inside all moments interacting by freeing the anchor of the physical mind(body) which is a conscious visual creation anyhow.</p>

<p>Sorry for the rambling you led me into some doorways here.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah the universe is expanding.

    <div class="md"><p>Well according to the article we can see these galaxies in our sky because the light that is hitting our eyes has travelled millions of years to reach us and made the trip back when space was expanding much slower. Space expansion has accelerated and it seems to be pushing us away from galaxies at faster than the speed of light meaning most of the lights in the sky we see that are galaxies will one day no longer burn for us as the light eventually cannot over come the speed of expansion to reach us. </p>
