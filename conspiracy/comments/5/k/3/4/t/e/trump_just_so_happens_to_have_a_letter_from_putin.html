    <div class="md"><p>Who is trying to pull him down?  I think the narrative would be different if Trump was out doing something charitable for xmas instead of tweeting about needing more nukes.</p>

<p>We are seeing reporting on his tweets that seem to suggest increasing nuclear stockpiles. And then a day later Trump has this letter from Putin dated the 15th that magically explains what Trump was incompetently trying to convey in his tweets from the 23rd. </p>

<p>You sound like Putin and Trump. And every other tinfoil hat who justifies authoritarian regimes with fear of some outside unknown outside cabal. </p>

<p>Let&#39;s focus on the real conspiracy of the very real strings we are seeing exposed between Putin and his puppet.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Trump is very likely an establishment puppet, yeah, but how about some actual sources for people to analyze when making claims? It&#39;s not super difficult. You just have to do an online search and results come up from CNN, POLITICO, etc.</p>

<p>Here is an example: <a href="http://www.politico.com/story/2016/12/putin-christmas-letter-to-trump-232952">http://www.politico.com/story/2016/12/putin-christmas-letter-to-trump-232952</a></p>

<p>And another: <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2016/12/23/politics/trump-putin-christmas-letter-russian-relations/">http://www.cnn.com/2016/12/23/politics/trump-putin-christmas-letter-russian-relations/</a></p>

<p>The full letter:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Dear Mr Trump, Please accept my warmest Christmas and New year greeting. Serious global and regional challenges, which our countries have to face in recent years, show that the relations between Russia and the U.S. remain an important factor in ensuring  stability and security of the modern world. I hope that after you assume the position of the President of the United States of America we will be able - by acting in a constructive and pragmatic manner - to take real steps to restore the framework of bilateral cooperation in different areas as well as bring our level of collaboration on the international scene to a qualitatively new level. Please accept my sincere wishes to you and your family of sound health, happiness, wellbeing, success and all the best. Sincerely, V. Putin</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So basically a recent letter from Putin expressing a desire for Russia and the U.S. to work together when it comes to international issues. I would rather see that than war mongering and escalated conflicts, or just blind hatred for entire nations, be it U.S., Russia, etc. </p>

<p>The possible terrible outcome with all of this is the U.S. and Russia working together to do sinister things, and hopefully we can continue to rely on brave independent journalists from other nations to go before the U.N. and tell the truth, since the MSM can&#39;t be trusted to report the truth.</p>
