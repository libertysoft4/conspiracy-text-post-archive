        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Honestly, this used to be a place for critical thinking. Now it&#39;s becoming a place for genuine people posing questions and a bunch of hive-minded, easy-answer seeking, dimwits rallying against any idea that isn&#39;t there own. It&#39;s like r/politics has leaked into this sub since Pizzagate blew up. I&#39;m not surprised, just pissed. This isn&#39;t a place for circle jerking, it&#39;s a place for taking something normally-accepted and looking at it from every angle. Take your downvotes and shove them securely up your ass, you closed-minded shills. Know that your resistance only makes us ask more questions, not less. That&#39;s the best part of the core of this sub. Your efforts are futile and you&#39;re just giving us more angles to see and helping us find new and better ways to combat stupidity. </p>

<p>Those dedicated to truth, I have nothing but love for you, whether we agree or not. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You are spot on. A lot of these Pizzagate people are just as closed minded as the SJWs crying in the streets right now. The clickbait headlines with no supporting evidence, the inability to accept any viewpoint outside their worldview, the narcissism, and the best part: attacking relentlessly those who ask important questions. These types of people completely discredit the movement, and there seem to be lots of them.</p>

<p>It would seem a lot of these people take this as a joke, and are merely out to make a name for themselves instead of what should be the #1 goal here: brining these sick fucks to justice. I am so grateful that there are still a few open minded people on this sub that can clearly see what is happening, you seem to be one of them. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>PG is not a perfect investigation. I can&#39;t stand when I see people beating dead leads or trying to argue that they feel like a suspect is a suspect because it would be convenient if they were. That&#39;s not how truth works. Find evidence. Present it. When you do it will be more rewarding than trying to fit a square peg into a circle hole. At the end of the day, it&#39;s a lot of people looking for easy answers to very difficult questions. We cannot settle for that. We our complex. Our systems are complex. Our problems are complex. And guess what... The solution and the truth behind it, is very complex. </p>

<p>Keep fighting the fight of justice. We have the potential bridge political gaps with our pursuit of justice. The problem is the involvement of the Clinton Foundation. It&#39;s a corruptly run pay to play institution with tentacles in everything. But once you say the C word, it is used as an opening to make assumptions. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not gonna lie, I downvote everything related to pizzagate. This sub has become invaded by The_Donald, all you need to do  is just look at the post history of virtually anyone that is an ardent supporter of Pizzagate or the shear lack of coverage of one of the most controversial president-elects where there&#39;s so much evidence of corruption and abuse that the media (including Wikileaks) literally said they couldn&#39;t keep up with it.</p>

<p>OP is probably literally complaining about people complaining about him in the Beau Biden post. Wow who knew disagreeing with OP meant you were a shill.</p>

<p>How  the hell  is a  post about Biden&#39;s son prosecuting a  pedophile on r/Conspiracy? I&#39;m sorry, I don&#39;t see how  anyone can go from pizza-related hankie left at house (that Podesta didnt even want back) to largest  cover up in history and still call themselves critical thinkers. Like even fucking Biden is the  schrodinger&#39;s pedophile. Just  a month ago  I got people downvoting me for  saying that you couldn&#39;t actually hear what Biden had  said when a video on the  front page had provided subtitles of Biden saying a little girl made him horny.</p>

<p>They are probably required to &quot;stay on message&quot; because it seems to me they post variations of the same phrases and arguments.

<p>They also try to dictate what is real and &quot;normal&quot; by using should/would statements.

    <div class="md"><p>bullshit.</p>

<p>The first one I was saying that if I wanted to make sure myself or the people closest to me got away with a crime, I would want to be the one leading the investigation. Is that not something we have seen before? It&#39;s called skepticism.</p>

<p>The second one was just me saying that the people at r/politics love to jump all over anything anti-Trump because it&#39;s low-hanging fruit. The article they hated on was misquoted, Trump or not, that&#39;s not a great way to read through political coverage. Just the headline? Come on, for a sub dedicated to politics I would expect better than that. Am I wrong? Do the people at r/politics NOT have biases?</p>

<p>The third one was me saying what I responded to below &quot;I defended the right to free speech. Trump is a catalyst for change. If you don&#39;t see that then you&#39;re not paying attention. Have we ever had a reality tv star, who pisses off their own party, who MSM rallied against make it into office? No? Then he&#39;s obviously a catalyst for change. Whether it&#39;s putting a mirror up to how broken our system is or pushing us to a point of desperation, change is change. But go on. Keep telling me my own arguments while simultaneously proving my point.&quot; which you so eloquently responded with an &quot;LOL!&quot; not sure what that means in reference to my response?</p>

<p>As I looked through your post history it&#39;s clear that I&#39;d be better off arguing with an inanimate object. You seem to like to throw people into groups to serve your own opposing opinions and then when you are back into a corner, respond with something dismissive or vague. I guess we all have our own techniques.</p>

And jumping on bandwagons is not where I choose to invest energy. I would much rather dig deep and find the less obvious infractions. Fortunately/unfortunately, Trumps shortcomings are on the forefront of MSM so it doesn&#39;t make much sense for me to add to those discussions. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, what you&#39;re posting is bullshit. </p>

<p>No, the first is you telling people to leave and calling them &quot;cucks&quot;, a term that has been pretty much adopted by Trump supporters as an insult. The second, again, is a passive aggressive response on your part. In addition, you don&#39;t even address how the Donald forum did the exact same thing. The third, again, is you supporting Trump. </p>

<p>So your use of the word cuck, attack on those from the politics forum and belief that Trump is a catalyst for change is quite telling. As for my lol, that was all your response deserved, laughter. Anything else or me doing a break by break like I normally do is a waste of time. Again, <strong>you</strong> have an agenda, so me going in depth and attempting to explain it is futile. Only thing I&#39;m doing now is suggesting people look at your history after reading your post. Once they see that, they&#39;ll see what your agenda is.</p>

<p>As for me, if I throw someone into a group it&#39;s because they took the steps to earn it. No one here, and let me type this again and bold it so you really get it, <strong>no one here has ever backed me into a corner, had me flip flopping like a fish out of water, forced me to make vague statements, etc.</strong> No one here, <strong>you least of all</strong>, has the ability to do that. </p>

<p>Edit: correction noted. Was busy with reddit and Xmas shit.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You should work for CNN. Your ability to read what I said and make it your own is almost impressive. </p>

<p>No group of people own claim to any word. Speech is free. I can call people cucks and make no implication about my affiliation. Cuck is short for cuckold. To cuckold refers to the idea of being allowed to be made inferior. By allowing your opinions to be swayed so easily by those around you, you allow yourself to be cuckolded. But fuck, I guess even Chaucer was a Trumptard, right?</p>

<p>Catalyst means change. The same way atomic catalyst can cause a huge explosion, I make no implication as to whether or not the catalyst will be good or bad. I guess I would argue that Clinton would have been a catalyst as well, although far less noticeable. As someone whose agenda is real social change, strengthening of the middle class, and de-privatization of media and pharmaceuticals, I think we must hit bottom before we can go up. Would I prefer that we come together and grow without needing war or depression? OF COURSE. But that opportunity was not given. Trump is that bottom. Clinton would have had us floating in the middle for another 4-8 years. </p>

<p>My aggression is not passive. Reddit is a shit storm. Collusion and censorship is rampant and I feel no remorse in calling out how prevalent it is in the r/politics sub. It exists all over this website. </p>

<p>My agenda changes everyday I learn something new. I can&#39;t wrap my brain around how someone can judge what my agenda is off of 4-5 posts. Reddit is not my main source of information, thank god. You could even take all of my internet history and still not understand a fraction of my perspective because I am a living man and my being cannot be held to a few posts on the Internet. </p>

<p>You can throw whoever you want into whatever group you want. That&#39;s your prerogative. But you miss a bigger picture and it seems as though you end up fueling a system of communication that serves no one, yourself included. </p>

<p>Good luck.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;If you don&#39;t like it, go away.&quot; Yeah no thanks. I&#39;d rather voice my opinion in, what I like to think, is still a pseudo-open forum. The purpose of this is not to be a cry-baby, but to raise awareness to my fellow truth-seekers that although this community seems to have changed with the rise of T_D, the migration of PG, and the over-taking of Politics, there are still those in this community that value critical thinking and understanding.</p>

<p>If you don&#39;t see how hive-mind on the internet is like a sort of social censorship, I&#39;d ask that you reevaluate.
