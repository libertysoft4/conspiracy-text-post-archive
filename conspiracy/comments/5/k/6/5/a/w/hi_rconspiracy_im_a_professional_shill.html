<p>As it is, you have told us nothing we haven&#39;t hear before, and you have provided zero evidence. It would be a big story if you could demonstrate that any of the mods were &quot;on the payroll&quot;, so what&#39;s holding you back?</p>

<p>It seems to me it is more likely that you are just a troll (ie unpaid) that the mods have banned today for being an offensive arse, and you have cranked up a VPN with a throwaway to get your revenge. </p>

<p>I&#39;ll say this to OP should he be genuine; you&#39;re pathetic. So are the people helping you. You&#39;re losers. You get paid to pass on other people&#39;s thoughts because you&#39;re too mentally and spiritually enfeebled to be an individual. So you take morally dubious jobs where you don&#39;t show your face or have any accountability. It&#39;s immature, sad, a hundred other things. But one thing it isn&#39;t is justifiable to any human other than yourself. So enjoy your Adderrall and your shilling e-friends. It was the best your life will ever get. Haven&#39;t you noticed the people you work for like Clinton can&#39;t come through on their promises to <em>anyone</em>? You sold your soul for exactly nothing, you probably weren&#39;t even paid. Good riddance.</p>

<p>If that&#39;s true, God help us. Because nobody knows for sure what&#39;s actually going on. But you get some very persuasive people who act like they know exactly what&#39;s going on.</p>

<p>Imagine these are the same kind of people advising (manipulating?) the top decision makers in the world&#39;s governments.</p>

<p>And they should never call them &quot;intelligence&quot; agencies. They&#39;re really just information agencies and sometimes their information is <em>wrong</em>.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t doubt what he&#39;s saying one bit, but simply saying it doesn&#39;t really do anything for me. I think there&#39;s a lot of us that have known this has been going on here for quite some time. I guess I only assumed the mods are in on it and haven&#39;t seen real proof yet, but let&#39;s be honest...</p>

<p>Mainstream media outlets are on the payroll, reddit admins are on the payroll. Why wouldn&#39;t mods of these subs be on the payroll? Didn&#39;t the oldest mod of this sub just leave a few weeks ago? It&#39;s laughable to think that it&#39;s impossible for every mod to be in someone&#39;s pocket.</p>

<p>I won&#39;t say they aren&#39;t, but what exactly would the mods on this sub in particular be doing to warrant being paid? They have public mod logs set up, so we can see if they&#39;re censoring any discussion on a particular topic, and other than a few instances where the admins intervened, I&#39;m unaware of any subjects that are taboo here, but if anyone has evidence feel free to PM me. Most of the manipulation in this sub in particular is done by vote manipulation, which the mods don&#39;t really have any control over. </p>

<p>I honestly think a sleeper situation is more likely than an active censoring/manipulation type role. I.e. wait until severe mod action is desired for one reason or another, and than have that mod or mods shut it down or do a takeover of some sort. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You make great points - and like I said I only assumed it to be true. I shouldn&#39;t assume but at this point it&#39;s hard not to.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve recently come to believe reddit and other mainstream discussion areas are much more engineered than I thought. I don&#39;t know why it took me so long to believe it to be true, frankly. We watch them manipulate mainstream news outlets for christ&#39;s sake (merry christmas btw), so to think that reddit, even this board, is a north star in a sea of disinformation is just ridiculous. </p>

<p>I&#39;m more of the opinion that this board is actually shilled harder than nearly any other, less &#39;mainstream&#39;, discussion area. I have come to see this board for what I believe it really is - a chokepoint of sorts - for ideas. There are places where people discuss information that is utterly destructive to very powerful people. Information that elites are willing to protect. I&#39;m sure you can imagine that a reddit board - or a private reddit board - is not the place to reveal how to find that information. </p>

<p>That, however doesn&#39;t mean reddit isn&#39;t an important battleground. Several places on reddit serve as conduits between the mainstream and that other harder to find side where there is currently more and more people getting their hands on that information I was talking about. Overall it&#39;s important to realize reddit is the mainstream media. If there&#39;s something TPTB don&#39;t want there, it simply won&#39;t be there, it&#39;s not a discussion. A good example is the recent media blackout of the dead NATO auditor. They have the ability to make a phone call and determine the course of the entire media. Reddit is not immune at all. </p>

<p>The controllers use many different tactics and go with what works on each particular board. You&#39;re right  to say that they use a lot of vote manipulation and thread sliding here. It&#39;s pretty bad. Did you hear about the riots in South Korea? A good question to ask is: Where did the information that caused 100s of thousands of people to take to the streets against government come from? You&#39;ll find it very difficult if not impossible to find a plausible source of that information - but you&#39;ll notice it coincides with assange&#39;s dead man&#39;s switch. A switch, mind you, that is still releasing information. Won&#39;t read that on reddit...</p>

<p>Do any of the respondents display the urge to supply information that could be helpful to your mission?</p>

<p>Do the respondents appear hostile to your attempts to steer the discussion?</p>

<p>Have you made a personal chart taking care to note who appear to be the “leaders” versus who appear to be the “followers”?</p>

<p>Have you attempted to gauge the “temperature” of the forum’s users?</p>

<p>In other words, the prevailing social psychology of the forum’s members?</p>

<p>Have you been more successful with one or the other XStart methods that were demonstrated in N-7015A.DOC?</p>

<p>Have more technical members (Computer Programmers, Administrators, or Moderators) of the forum deduced or accused you of hiding behind a proxy?</p>

<p>Would you gain more trust and/or credibility if you were to use one of the Agency’s allotted “HOME” pools? (most often needed when handling EVTS that are more sensitive to the pop. of a specific locale but also location centered web sites such as FB or Patch)</p>

<p>Has your PREDEV “persona” been successful or do you gauge that the users find you to be too obtrusive? Accusations of being “ever present” are.</p>

<p>I told you while you were a mod that I didn&#39;t think you were capable of separating yourself from this concept of objective truth and how that isn&#39;t compatible with a conspiracy subreddit where people speculate constantly.  That&#39;s why a lot of people come here, to speculate.  You can moderate that out of the community or force them to format their title like their a fucking contestant on jeopardy just to satisfy some assholes desire to have objectively true titles into perpetuity.</p>

<p>The fact that he&#39;s PMing people with shit like &quot;Your mods are against you, don&#39;t trust them!&quot; while simultaneously PMing some of the mods with &quot;Your fellow mods are against you, don&#39;t trust them!&quot; smells like a desperate attempt to cause discord by someone who is very obviously bitter and pissed at this sub for some reason.</p>

<p>That&#39;s just my guess.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The night Saturn stood still.</p>

<p>One night I went camping with my wife and I took a massive dose synthetic psilocybin. </p>

<p>I rarely dabble in recreational drug use of any kind but the occasion called for it... Anyways didn&#39;t take too long till everything was moving wildly. The camp fire was making the trees next to me melt in fantastic colors, all the while every star in the sky was swirling with great viger. Everything in my field of vision was moving except for a single object in the sky. My sober sitter and wifey pooh had to use a star charting app on her phone to see what it was, sure enough it was Saturn. </p>

<p>I tried everything to make Saturn budge. I stared at It for well over an hour and it was completely stationary. Even tried using my perifual vision but nothing worked.</p>

<p>Gotta disclose that I&#39;m not really into astronomy so going into that experience I had no idea where Saturn was.</p>

<p>This guy is still a shill. 100% fuck him</p>
