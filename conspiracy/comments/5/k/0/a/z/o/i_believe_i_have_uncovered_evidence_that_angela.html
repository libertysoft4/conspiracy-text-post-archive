        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><h1>Abstract:</h1>

<p>Angela Merkel and those within the EU and German government who are aligned with her are knowingly allowing ISIS operatives to infiltrate the EU, set up networks and stage attacks on European citizens.  The goal of allowing this to occur is to create a crisis which will artificially deepen the need for greater European integration into the EU, which is of course mostly controlled by Germany and allows them to control Europe without firing a single shot (so far).  Once the crisis has been created, Merkel will use it as an excuse to use the newly formed EU Army to occupy European nations. This army seems to currently be supplied by NATO and NATO officials who are in a position to discover this are showing up dead.</p>

<h1>I. German Intelligence is knowingly neglecting to deal with ISIS operatives</h1>

<p>In Wikileaks’ recent BND-NSA Inquiry Exhibit, there was a cache of files from the Bundesamt für Migration und Flüchtlinge (BAMF) or Federal Office for Migration and Refugees.  Firstly, the language of the original German in this document is highly un-PC, showing just how little Eurocrats really care about racial sensitivity behind closed doors. They prefer to use it as a foil to coerce others into submitting to their agendas. The document covers tips that BAMF gives to German intelligence agencies looking to recruit informants from among refugee populations:</p>

<p><a href="https://wikileaks.org/bnd-inquiry/docs/BAMF/MAT%20A%20BAMF-1a.pdf">https://wikileaks.org/bnd-inquiry/docs/BAMF/MAT%20A%20BAMF-1a.pdf</a></p>

<p>The significant portions of this document are as follows:</p>

<p>On page 14:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>We&#39;re looking for accomplices or candidates involved in terrorist activities that have not yet become perpetrators</p>
</blockquote>

<p>They are specifically looking for Taliban defectors from Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan as well as civilians born in Afghanistan and Egypt as well as a few other Middle Eastern countries.</p>

<p>On pages 15-16 they list tiers of individuals they are looking to recruit from:</p>

<p><strong>Tier 1</strong>: Males with the following personal features: Aged 18-45, single, lower-middle-class to poor background, lived in refugee camps for a while, poor occupational and societal prospects, sketchy CV, Muslim belief, doesn&#39;t support UMMA (collective community of Islamic peoples).</p>

<p><strong>Tier 2</strong>: Individuals with knowledge about suspected terrorist organizations</p>

<p><strong>Tier 3</strong>: Individuals that resided in or have knowledge about Al-Azher University, Cairo or the El-Haramein Institute of Culture which is founded by Saudi Arabia and used to promote Wahabbism.</p>

<p>This is highly alarming, because it proves that German intelligence is aware of the fact that there are many individuals among the refugee population that have knowledge of terror organizations, are “defectors” from them or have been exposed to radical Islamic ideologies at certain educational institutions.  Why are they not simply arresting these people and preventing them from 1) committing attacks and 2) radicalizing even more males from the refugee population?</p>

<p>This discovery was followed today with another which has not yet been widely discovered by the public: Moroccan government officials have stated that they tipped Germany off to the fact that Berlin truck attacker Anis Amri was planning to execute a terror event on German soil:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.moroccoworldnews.com/2016/12/204265/moroccan-intelligence-services-informed-germany-about-tunisian-suspect/">https://www.moroccoworldnews.com/2016/12/204265/moroccan-intelligence-services-informed-germany-about-tunisian-suspect/</a></p>

<p><a href="http://archive.is/Vwxkk">http://archive.is/Vwxkk</a></p>

<p>The article explains that Spanish and French authorities has successfully dismantled terror cells based on information passed to them by Moroccan intelligence. Why did Germany not act? It is because Angela Merkel has a vested interested in creating a crisis by allowing ISIS attacks to occur in the EU.</p>

<p>This apparent policy of letting a wild dog like ISIS run rampant does come back to bite them occasionally however. An German intelligence official working for ISIS was recently arrested for helping plot an attack the headquarters of Germany’s domestic intelligence agency, the Bundesverfassungsschutz (BfV):</p>

<p><a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/2291462/german-intelligence-officer-arrested-over-islamist-plot-to-bomb-agencys-headquarters/">https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/2291462/german-intelligence-officer-arrested-over-islamist-plot-to-bomb-agencys-headquarters/</a></p>

<p><a href="http://archive.is/EwwZa">http://archive.is/EwwZa</a></p>

<p>It is very strange that Germany would be allowing this kind of thing to happen. Unless of course, one views it from the perspective that they might want incidents to occur as a result of neglecting to crack down on known and potential extremists.</p>

<h1>II. Germany allows ISIS events to occur to justify occupying Europe with the EU Army</h1>

<p><strong>A. The EU Army</strong></p>

<p>Merkel was already trying to form an EU Army before Brexit occurred and accelerated the need to create some kind of force that would allow them to militarily pressure countries into abandoning plans to leave as well.  European Union allies of Merkel were lobbying for this force to exist even before Brexit. What people do not realize is that it has already been partially set up:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/mar/08/jean-claude-juncker-calls-for-eu-army-european-commission-miltary">https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/mar/08/jean-claude-juncker-calls-for-eu-army-european-commission-miltary</a></p>

<p><a href="http://archive.is/k08N1">http://archive.is/k08N1</a></p>

<p>Already EU technocrats are letting on to the public that the EU Army will be formed “much faster than people think”:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.gatestoneinstitute.org/8935/european-army">https://www.gatestoneinstitute.org/8935/european-army</a></p>

<p><a href="http://archive.is/gM7JC">http://archive.is/gM7JC</a></p>

<p>Just a few months ago, Jean Claude Juncker was requesting the establishment of a headquarters for the EU Army to operate out of. An operations center is unnecessary if there is not already a military force to run out of it:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-37359196">http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-37359196</a></p>

<p><a href="http://archive.is/2PmUV">http://archive.is/2PmUV</a></p>

<p><strong>B. NATO arms/vehicles are being used to covertly equip the EU Army</strong></p>

<p>There has been quite a bit of media attention given to recent NATO efforts to posture itself militarily to “stand up to Russian aggression.”  A lot of weaponry and heavily machinery has been moved into the EU and Eastern Europe/the V4 (Visegrad Group):</p>

<p><a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/news/ash-carter-heavy-weapons-eastern-nato-russia-nuclear-provocations-ukraine/">http://www.cbsnews.com/news/ash-carter-heavy-weapons-eastern-nato-russia-nuclear-provocations-ukraine/</a></p>

<p><a href="http://archive.is/aYmxr">http://archive.is/aYmxr</a></p>

<p><a href="https://www.rt.com/news/239021-us-tanks-latvia-arrive/">https://www.rt.com/news/239021-us-tanks-latvia-arrive/</a></p>

<p><a href="http://archive.is/9yPDX">http://archive.is/9yPDX</a></p>

<p>Here is another example of German military assets being moved into Eastern Europe to “counter Russian aggression.” Notice how they mention Trump’s election as an incentive to form an EU Army? Merkel was hoping her friend Hillary Clinton would win power and collaborate to make this project easier:</p>

<p><a href="https://euobserver.com/foreign/135877">https://euobserver.com/foreign/135877</a></p>

<p><a href="http://archive.is/qTfi6">http://archive.is/qTfi6</a> </p>

<p>The Russia narrative is a cover story for the formation and equipping of the EU Army. NATO’s shipments of weapons and vehicles to Europe are not for the purpose of arming the alliance against Russia, but to give that gear to Merkel for her new EU force. Most of this stuff is surplus American military gear, think for example about how many unused tanks we have sitting around due to supposed Congressional incompetence.</p>

<p>There is ample indication that NATO is indeed engaging in this covert supply operation with the EU. The current Secretary General of NATO is Jens Stoltenberg, who allegedly was bought the position by a $584 million bribe from Norway to the Clinton Foundation.  He is also alleged to be connected to the recent corruption scandal uncovered in part by the FBI.  Here are some sources on that:</p>

<p><a href="http://archive.is/KdeXA">http://archive.is/KdeXA</a></p>

<p>Given his ties to corruption and the Clintons, it is plausible that Stoltenberg is willing to collaborate with Angela Merkel, another ally of the Clintons. He is responsible for massively increasing NATO’s budget over the last few years:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.express.co.uk/news/world/737513/Hillary-Clinton-charity-received-millions-in-German-cash-after-praising-Angela-Merkel">http://www.express.co.uk/news/world/737513/Hillary-Clinton-charity-received-millions-in-German-cash-after-praising-Angela-Merkel</a></p>

<p><a href="http://archive.is/LVogg">http://archive.is/LVogg</a></p>

<p><strong>Most damning</strong> is the recent death of Yves Chandelon, the Head Auditor of NATO. He was found dead 140 kilometers from his work and 100 kilometers from his home in the Belgian city of Lens. Despite owning three registered weapons, the gun used to kill him was unregistered:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.pravdareport.com/news/hotspots/22-12-2016/136486-nato-0/">http://www.pravdareport.com/news/hotspots/22-12-2016/136486-nato-0/</a></p>

<p><a href="http://archive.is/SIZl3">http://archive.is/SIZl3</a></p>

<p>His death was ruled a “suicide” but his family refuses to believe that conclusion. He had told them that he had the feeling that he was being followed and had also received strange phone calls. His further revealed that he was a happy person and had made several plans for the new year. Not the profile of someone who kills themselves:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.demorgen.be/buitenland/belgische-navo-topper-sterft-verdachte-dood-b8296fbb/">http://www.demorgen.be/buitenland/belgische-navo-topper-sterft-verdachte-dood-b8296fbb/</a></p>

<p><a href="http://archive.is/PyBeO">http://archive.is/PyBeO</a></p>

<p>Why is his death significant? One of the jobs of an auditor is to make sure goods are actually delivered to their destination. Revenue cannot be recognized until service is performed. What did Chandelon find about weapons and vehicle deliveries that caused him to be murdered? Where would these lost shipments be going, if not to equip and supply another army? The EU Army?</p>

<h1>III. How ISIS provides Merkel with an excuse to occupy Europe with her new army</h1>

<p>With an EU army formed, Merkel would only need to look for a good excuse to deploy it. The most likely cover story would be to diffuse some kind of “humanitarian crisis.” What exactly might that crisis look like? There could be a number of reasons, such as fighting “far right racism” against minorities for example. </p>

<p>I personally believe that given the evidence I have uncovered about Germany’s complicity in allowing Islamic extremists to enter the EU, the evidence indicates that they are possibly hoping ISIS will stage a major terror incident in one or two locations in the EU, or perhaps across the entire Union. The militaries of multiple countries would inevitably engage in an immediate crackdown following such a severe event and this would most likely focus solely on migrant heavy areas and “no go zones” inhabited by the Muslim minorities in Europe. This would give the EU a perfect humanitarian excuse to justify violating the sovereignty of multiple European nations and centralize power with the EU government, which is mainly German controlled.</p>

<p>Breitbart, I reached out to you guys this week and expressed my desire to bring my networks and the work I do to your publication but you seemed a little nonplussed about it. Andrew didn’t found your company so that you could spend your existence trolling the internet to repost stories broken by other news corporations. I’m on the market, think you have a lot of potential and want to help you guys be the ones who create breaking news.</p>

<p>Sounds like every Muslim I&#39;ve ever met. We all knew ISIS was USA from the photography and editing of their propoganda videos , from the fact that most of their members are mercenaries or ex.prisoners in Iraq (MK ultrad??), and mainly because our religion explicitly goes against everything ISIS stands for.</p>

<p>Every Muslim is so glad the world is woke and viewing the world for what it is and what the government really is. And as a Palestinian , I personally am so happy so many are getting redpilled. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>For what it&#39;s worth, if anything, as backwards as it sounds.</p>

<p>I know some service members, including myself, who are appalled upon being presented (either by others or self discovered) the truth about what&#39;s going on behind the scenes. 
Men and women that absolutely cannot take back the things they&#39;ve taken part in, and the people they&#39;ve lost for a cause that was only a lie. </p>

<p>For the record, I&#39;m not stating everything the military does is wrong, only that it is absolutely undeniable that shit rolls downhill, and often the truth is covered in shit and goes right by, unnoticed. </p>

<p>I can&#39;t really apologize, but I sincerely hope the mass awakens and I see more soldiers refusing orders that are truly unjust. War is hell.
Especially when the handlers are the ones killing their own dogs.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sounds like a great idea, however, there is just about zero chance of any German, or almost any other EU member-state citizen for that matter, speaking out against anything related to the overwhelming flood of Islamic &quot;refugees&quot; into Germany, Netherlands, Sweden, Austria, Switzerland, Belgium, Denmark, France, without facing serious jail time for anti-Semitic/hate speech.  Dissent and open debate of policies, politics, or actions that affect the broad population has, quite literally, been outlawed.</p>

<p>The impacts and consequences of speaking freely, and then being labeled a neo-Nazi/Brown Party supporter, are utterly catastrophic - we&#39;re talking Big Brother on steroids kind of effects - asset seizures/accounts locked, jobs eliminated, warrantless searches and wiretaps, travel and passport bans, public naming/shaming - all in direct violation of German &quot;law&quot;.</p>

<p>I haven&#39;t checked your sources fully yet, but will do so tomorrow.</p>

<p>What really strikes me in this case is once more the typical &quot;left the ID at the crime scene and being shot dead shortly after the attack&quot; scheme. Combined with the numerosus fuck ups of the BND/Bundespolizei (He was Jailed in the JVA in the meantime/he was observed over a aperiod of several months/His ID was found suprisingly late while having another suspect in the first 24 hours) really made me wonder if this thing wasn&#39;t planned big time in the first place.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>German here: Dude, please read the actual German Sources and newspaper articles - many are available in English. </p>

<p>While there&#39;s been a lot of incompetence in the German security services during this case, being incompetent is nothing new for them. They also knew about but did not manage to stop the neo-nazi terror group <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Socialist_Underground">NSU</a> - they are just bad at their job, not actively malevolent.</p>

<p>Concerning the BAMF document: The German Verfassungsschutz tries to recruit people inside terror organizations as so-called <a href="https://de.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/V-Person">V-Personen</a> in order to get informations. Nothing new there.</p>

<p>Germany both tried to deport Amri to Tunisia (but failed, <a href="http://m.morgenpost.de/politik/article209051109/So-scheiterte-die-Abschiebung-des-Verdaechtigen-Anis-Amri.html">as Tunisia did not want to take him back</a>) and then tried to arrest Amri together with the Walaa-group, but missed him <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abu_Walaa">(source)</a>. Shortly thereafter, he committed his attack.</p>

<p>In conclusion, while this case was handled really amateurish, this is kind of to be expected over here. German newspapers have way more information on the case then international media, so please do not jump to conclusions from just reading stuff like The Sun. It is quite frustrating to see the international community have no idea but strong opinions about German security all the time.</p>

<p>Yeah man, major brownie points for this post and I&#39;m saving it for later to catch up on all the links for context.</p>

<p>Merkel is clearly fucking insane with what she&#39;s doing. She&#39;s also good friends with Soros and supposedly he&#39;s pulling her strings on which actions to take, and this is the only reason why any of this would make sense.</p>

<p>Before I knew about the merkel/Soros connection, none of your post would have made sense. Why would she want an E.U. Army? Russia isn&#39;t a threat and Islam isn&#39;t yet a big enough threat to justify an E.U. army.</p>

<p>There have been Muslims Migrants in France since I believe the 70&#39;s and there has been relative peace there, besides the ever expanding French/Muslim population which is the highest in unemployed and poor class, along with the associated cultural norms that come with that class, petty crimes, gangs, drug dealing.....but for the most part they weren&#39;t really any major terrorist acts until Merkel&#39;s dumb ass opened the floodgates to the worse of the worse sneaking in.</p>

<p>E.U Army sort of still doesn&#39;t make sense. That shit costs billions and what are they going to do with it when there&#39;s already NATO and each of the E.U. countries has their own armies...really doesn&#39;t make sense.</p>

<p>Maybe it&#39;s all about Military Industrial Complex selling the gear for Merkel&#39;s army and she gets some massive kickback from it?</p>

<p>Regardless, she is a MASSIVE threat to Europe and I&#39;m surprised nobody has attempted to JFK her </p>

<p>Lol...by &#39;korans &amp; holy water&#39; .....no, by cultural Jihad, or &#39;stealth&#39; jihad.

<p>Wait get this because a &quot;NY post&quot; article said the word &quot;drugs&quot; that means muslims are very highly involved in crime and drug dealing</p>

<p>The same western media also reports that there are no go zones in britain where no non muslims can go (i don&#39;t got to tell you how untrue that shit it is)</p>

<p>Also sharia law only Zones (false and illegal) (sharia law cannot supercede common law in the UK for example)</p>

<p>Have you ever been to europe i&#39;ve been to UK, France, Germany Poland</p>

<p>Stay in ur bubble consuming false information here&#39;s a rule of thumb in europe There is no &quot;<strong>liberal media</strong>&quot;
whatsoever no1 likes muslims there </p>

<p>Muslims don&#39;t prothesize or increase to anyone </p>

<p>Young black teens turn to islam as they want to avoid crime, street activities and some east africans have a heritage close to it.</p>

<p>AHAHAHAHAHAHAAHAHAHAHH</p>

<p>What? Islam has also genocided factions/religions/people and has committed slavery for centuries. Here you go:</p>

<p>At least the muslims were smart enough to cut the balls off the blacks they enslaved so they couldn&#39;t interbreed with their own people (see Black Eunuchs):</p>

<p>None of that means Nostradamus was debunked. Many historic psychics (See Edgar Cayce) have said that the future is malleable, and that if you choose B instead of A, you end up going down a different set of life events/world events/historic events.</p>

<p>For example, if Merkel hadn&#39;t allowed millions of muslims into Germany/Europe......you would probably prevent Islamification of Europe. But since she choose A ..then we will get what follows</p>

Have you ever wondered why it&#39;s the dirt poor countries with lower IQ&#39;s maby it has something to do with the vegetation and low nutrition and the trauma from colonialization</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Sure I&#39;ve considered that. Doesn&#39;t matter if its because of the lack of nutrition, what matters is that its super low IQ, inbreeding, and still a continued lack of nutrition + fundamentalist brainwashing. And actually, colonialization helped Islam to enter into a reformed period or Golden Era where education was allowed, chemistry and mathematical breakthroughs happened, etc. Not anymore though, lol</p>

<p>Lol, yeah okay....they&#39;ll have to get past the AR-15 and several glocks first, plus I&#39;d be in the revolution with millions of others freeing the world from Islam if it happens during my lifetime. But according to your logic, you&#39;d be failry quick to convert, and by then would be forced to fight on their side or they&#39;d kill you for other reasons, like not &#39;pedo&#39;ing or raping&#39; enough with suicide vest tactics</p>

<p>Yes of course, this is what Islam does, it fights with the world and with itself while degrading women and pedo&#39;ing the children. No surprise there, actually which Islamic Enslaved countries do like each other?</p>

<p>Anyway, I don&#39;t want to fagpill you anymore because you&#39;re clearly unhinged and possibly preparing suicide vest for my house and my family, and I just want peace until the time comes to fight back against the islamification of America.</p>

<p>So whatever you and your ackbar&#39;s and moongod allah&#39;s believe and want with jihad and all your holy wars.....keep believing I guess. I&#39;d rather you guys stay busy taking over Europe and England, it gives me more time to raise my sons to be freedom fighters in the future</p>

<p>and not bother the &quot;backward&quot; or &quot;third world&quot; people</p>

<p>don&#39;t give them technology or enslave them and there would be no resentment or even chance of terrorism</p>

<p>the whole soviet war in afghanistan was about this</p>

<p>the soviets lamented</p>

<p>&quot;i don&#39;t think it&#39;s a good idea to intervene and we don&#39;t think your countrymen will ever forgive us&quot;</p>

<p>but the sambos who wanted to be modernized insisted on Soviet intervention</p>

<p>The soviets withdrew (lost according to some peoples opinions)</p>

<p>And the during the war The US helped  intervened by &quot;radicalizing&quot; the muslims in the first place the &quot;mujahadeen&quot;</p>

<p>The soviets were right sambos lost.</p>

<p>The &quot;US&#39;s&quot; own radicalization allegedly backfired on them when &quot;a man in a cave&quot; conduceted &quot;the biggest attack on american soil against the largest military power in history&quot; without any knowledge of it himself and would later be proven correct by an fbi report that stated there was no connection to the orginization AL Qaeda or Osama bin laden or Saddam Hussein.</p>

<p>Then the US went to where soviets didnt want to go in the first place and lost it became known as the &quot;graveyard of superpowers&quot; pretty good for some &quot;third worlders&quot; who just wanted to be left alone to farm on their land and fuckin piss where they wanted.</p>

<p>Stormfront&#39;s latest &quot;trick&quot; is propagation of the idea of the Khazar Mafia, where they presuppose that a secret race of world-dominating aliens infiltrated Jews hundreds of years ago and have been at the forefront of every societal disaster, all in the name of creating a Jewish supremacy. If it weren&#39;t so dumb it&#39;d be somewhat hilarious. </p>

<p>The reason why Jews seem cabalistic is because of the Jewish Quota, which banned Jews from participating in Higher Education. It&#39;s the same action you see taken against Asian students - the search for a &quot;well rounded candidate&quot; started as a means of only selecting WASPs.</p>

<p>So only the best and brightest Jews got a chance at academia - where they obviously excelled. Then, obviously, they opened up scholarship funds for other jews so what happened to them wouldn&#39;t happen to anyone else.</p>

<p>But Rupert Murdoch isn&#39;t Jewish.</p>

<p>Bannon isn&#39;t Jewish. Ted Turner isn&#39;t Jewish. Elon Musk isn&#39;t Jewish.</p>

<p>There is no Jewish Conspiracy to take over the world because, if I recall, it was the Irish Catholic who started the Banking Cartel at the turn of the century, spurred on by the wealthy German immigrants. Jews weren&#39;t accepted into society until the early part of the 80s, at which point all their previous American oppression was whitewashed. And there was that New Age Occultism/Nazi chic movement going around. Most of the original Power Bankers of America were <em>Episcopalian</em> - those who weren&#39;t eventually converted in their lineage (Jacob Shiff was pro-Jewish but not a Zionist, his descendants became Episcopalian to marry into Al Gore&#39;s family). </p>

<p>The idea that Jews control freemasonry is part of a Soviet/Nazi propaganda machine (and Henry Ford) - The Elders of the Protocol of Zion. It&#39;s bullshit propagated by Stormfront, The Daily Stormer, etc. Their newest conspiracy is that of the Khazarian Mafia - basically a way to target certain Jews they don&#39;t like <em>while totally not being anti-semetic, guise...</em>. </p>

<p>If it&#39;s half-fake, then it&#39;s completely fake. Because either your implying of the Khazar Mafia (they&#39;re not real jews, amirite guise?) is real or not. </p>

<p>So, definitely fake, because there is no Khazar Mafia, and there is no cabal.</p>

    <div class="md"><p><strong>I. German Intelligence is knowingly neglecting to deal with ISIS operatives</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>This is highly alarming, because it proves that German intelligence is aware of the fact that there are many individuals among the refugee population that have knowledge of terror organizations, are “defectors” from them or have been exposed to radical Islamic ideologies at certain educational institutions. Why are they not simply arresting these people and preventing them from 1) committing attacks and 2) radicalizing even more males from the refugee population?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You don&#39;t have to be an intelligence agency to know that. There are many refugees, with many different backgrounds. Some have a background that makes them more susceptible for radicalization, and some of them are already radicalized. The question is who those people are, but even then, if they haven&#39;t done or planned anything illegal, they can&#39;t just be arrested.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The article explains that Spanish and French authorities has successfully dismantled terror cells based on information passed to them by Moroccan intelligence. Why did Germany not act? It is because Angela Merkel has a vested interested in creating a crisis by allowing ISIS attacks to occur in the EU.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>They did act. He was being observed by the intelligence agencies until they lost track of him, but he didn&#39;t do anything illegal in that period. After the attack, he fled to Italy, which is where he may have had contacts.</p>

<p><strong>II. Germany allows ISIS events to occur to justify occupying Europe with the EU Army</strong></p>

<p>The EU is a union, so close collaboration and union is to be expected. An official EU army would still be a military collaboration of the member states, so whether it will officially be called that will make no difference. To say that the EU army could occupy anyone is just silly.</p>

<p><strong>III. How ISIS provides Merkel with an excuse to occupy Europe with her new army</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>I personally believe that given the evidence I have uncovered about Germany’s complicity in allowing Islamic extremists to enter the EU (...)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>They don&#39;t. They let in people who claim to be refugees.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>(...) they are possibly hoping ISIS will stage a major terror incident in one or two locations in the EU, or perhaps across the entire Union. The armies of multiple countries would inevitably engage in an immediate crackdown following such a severe event and this would most likely focus solely on migrant heavy areas and “no go zones” inhabited by the Muslim minorities in Europe. This would give the EU a perfect humanitarian excuse to justify violating the sovereignty of multiple European nations and centralize power with the EU government, which is mainly German controlled.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Major terrorist attacks are perfectly possible, but to think that will prompt the member states to make Merkel their supreme leader is ludicrous. Even if ISIS had thousands of radical supporters spread across the EU that would suddenly go into attack mode, that would at best trigger martial law in countries, and considering those terrorists wouldn&#39;t have major strongholds, weapons, or supply lines, they wouldn&#39;t stand a chance. Even then, a &quot;EU army&quot; would still be a military collaboration, and countries cannot just give away their sovereignty with a phone call.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Do you believe that large-scale battle exercises like NATO&#39;s Trident Juncture are part of building up this EU Army of which you speak? The earliest information about Trident Juncture seems to be found in 2014, and the first exercise appears to have been conducted in 2015 on European soil. It&#39;s <strong><em>huge</em></strong>, too. 36,000 troops from over 30 nations. I always wondered, outside of the whole proposed Russian war aspect, why this large of an exercise was even necessary. It felt like WW3-scale exercises, and they were played off as war games in a way. This NATO auditor being suicided is no coincidence. War games, my ass.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I thoroughly looked through the sources and still, I have to conclude there’s a lot of speculation here.</p>

<p><strong>I. German Intelligence is knowingly neglecting to deal with ISIS operatives</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>This is highly alarming, because it proves that German intelligence is aware of the fact that there are many individuals among the refugee population that have knowledge of terror organizations, are “defectors” from them or have been exposed to radical Islamic ideologies at certain educational institutions. Why are they not simply arresting these people and preventing them from 1) committing attacks and 2) radicalizing even more males from the refugee population?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It’s not a crime (yet) to know of terror organisations. The German intelligence needs these people on their side to prevent further attacks. It is a common tactic to prevent crime and it’s used by FBI as well. <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/cointelprodocs/the-use-of-informants-in-fbi-intelligence-investigations#sec1a1">https://sites.google.com/site/cointelprodocs/the-use-of-informants-in-fbi-intelligence-investigations#sec1a1</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Why did Germany not act? It is because Angela Merkel has a vested interested in creating a crisis by allowing ISIS attacks to occur in the EU.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is a case-specific jump to conclusion. A lot of terrorist acts have been tipped off previously and officials were incapable of doing anything (<a href="https://theintercept.com/2015/11/18/terrorists-were-already-known-to-authorities/">https://theintercept.com/2015/11/18/terrorists-were-already-known-to-authorities/</a>). Now this could mean that countries other than Germany are conspiring in a similar manner against their citizens. Or it could be that the authorities don’t have the power or the concern to stop the attacks in time.</p>

<p><strong>II. Germany allows ISIS events to occur to justify occupying Europe with the EU Army</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>The Russia narrative is a cover story for the formation and equipping of the EU Army. NATO’s shipments of weapons and vehicles to Europe are not for the purpose of arming the alliance against Russia, but to give that gear to Merkel for her new EU force.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The threat of Russia is very real, although their propaganda machine successfully manipulates Europeans to believe otherwise. <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/apr/02/putin-kremlin-inside-russian-troll-house">https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/apr/02/putin-kremlin-inside-russian-troll-house</a> <a href="http://www.stopfake.org/en/finnish-researcher-russia-ramping-up-its-information-war/">http://www.stopfake.org/en/finnish-researcher-russia-ramping-up-its-information-war/</a> Russian military spending has been steadily increasing over the past decade <a href="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/BkDTtmqCQAApGlK.jpg">https://pbs.twimg.com/media/BkDTtmqCQAApGlK.jpg</a> <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/62/Russian_Military_Spending_1992-2012_SIPRI.jpg">https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/62/Russian_Military_Spending_1992-2012_SIPRI.jpg</a> and further in the upcoming year <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/russia-vladimir-putin-military-expansion-reinforcements-europe-a7491276.html">http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/russia-vladimir-putin-military-expansion-reinforcements-europe-a7491276.html</a></p>

<p>The EU army is a direct response to the threat, seeing as Trump has spoken of withdrawing NATO support from Europe. European military spending has been decreasing in the past <a href="http://www.iss.europa.eu/uploads/media/Brief_10_Defence_spending.pdf">http://www.iss.europa.eu/uploads/media/Brief_10_Defence_spending.pdf</a>. Europe needs a repellant, in case Russia decides to continue the trend to invade and annex territories from its neighbouring countries. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_wars_involving_Russia#Russian_Federation_.281991.E2.80.93present.29">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_wars_involving_Russia#Russian_Federation_.281991.E2.80.93present.29</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Where would these lost shipments be going, if not to equip and supply another army? The EU Army?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The Russian Army? ISIS?</p>

<p><strong>III. How ISIS provides Merkel with an excuse to occupy Europe with her new army</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>This would give the EU a perfect humanitarian excuse to justify violating the sovereignty of multiple European nations and centralize power with the EU government, which is mainly German controlled.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If the EU army consists of EU member nations, how would it violate the sovereignty of EU member nations?</p>

<p>Germany doesn’t de facto control the EU. It is the arguably most powerful country in the EU but it is the media and the people of the EU that have chosen to listen to Merkel. She’s not the president of the EU.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Breitbart, I reached out to you guys this week and expressed my desire to bring my networks and the work I do to your publication but you seemed a little nonplussed about it. Andrew didn’t found your company so that you could spend your existence trolling the internet to repost stories broken by other news corporations. I’m on the market, think you have a lot of potential and want to help you guys be the ones who create breaking news.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Did you forget to delete something here? Are you working for someone?</p>

<p><strong>In sum, I believe the EU is being manipulated by Russia to the extent that the desire to ensure our own security is painted as a conspiracy.</strong></p>

<p>2) Her goal is not to overtly force Germany onto other Europeans, it&#39;s to dilute national identity to make Europe easier to control. Look up the Kalergi plan. He was a philosopher from the 20&#39;s who advocated exactly what is happening in the EU right now.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not surprised, I think I said something along these lines in a previous post. Trump&#39;s victory might have encouraged other opposition to the Globalist agenda and inspired the citizens of Europe to control their own destiny, something the Globalist don&#39;t want. The media transform it into far right facism and will no doubt hire &quot;Neo Nazis&quot; to cause terror in the Muslims ghettos and the attacks on German people will increase further. This would give the EU army time to come of age and threaten other European nations to fall in line, or else.</p>

<p>Great and informative post.</p>

<p>Thanks lad, get the word out.</p>

<p>Yeah man, major brownie points for this post and I&#39;m saving it for later to catch up on all the links for context.</p>

<p>Merkel is clearly fucking insane with what she&#39;s doing. She&#39;s also good friends with Soros and supposedly he&#39;s pulling her strings on which actions to take, and this is the only reason why any of this would make sense.</p>

<p>Before I knew about the merkel/Soros connection, none of your post would have made sense. Why would she want an E.U. Army? Russia isn&#39;t a threat and Islam isn&#39;t yet a big enough threat to justify an E.U. army.</p>

<p>There have been Muslims Migrants in France since I believe the 70&#39;s and there has been relative peace there, besides the ever expanding French/Muslim population which is the highest in unemployed and poor class, along with the associated cultural norms that come with that class, petty crimes, gangs, drug dealing.....but for the most part they weren&#39;t really any major terrorist acts until Merkel&#39;s dumb ass opened the floodgates to the worse of the worse sneaking in.</p>

<p>E.U Army sort of still doesn&#39;t make sense. That shit costs billions and what are they going to do with it when there&#39;s already NATO and each of the E.U. countries has their own armies...really doesn&#39;t make sense.</p>

<p>Maybe it&#39;s all about Military Industrial Complex selling the gear for Merkel&#39;s army and she gets some massive kickback from it?</p>

<p>Regardless, she is a MASSIVE threat to Europe and I&#39;m surprised nobody has attempted to JFK her </p>
