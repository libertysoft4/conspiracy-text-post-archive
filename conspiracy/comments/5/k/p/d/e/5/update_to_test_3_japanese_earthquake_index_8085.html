<p>Here she comes. (sunspot 48). </p>

<p>She is a little early, however she looks quite primed for a earth directed impact. </p>

<p>In the last two weeks it appears she&#39;s reached a level of complicity nearing her breakdown as expected. </p>

<p>I imagine Solar winds will easily reach up to 850km/s 
This will likely induce a planetary bell ringer. We may see elevated activity as soon as the first; But we are banking on the exiting winds to produce the predicted impact and its effects on our home planet; </p>

<p>I assess a 25% scale tsunami to be associated with this series from the (3/11) earthquake. Seismologists will state this is an aftershock from that earthquake. Don&#39;t buy that b.s. Were testing trumpet theory up in here-</p>

<p>So There you have it. My update as promised. </p>

<p>To learn more about my stupid ideas that are more seemingly showing positive results You can follow tests as they were in past succession.  </p>

<p>Test <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/5gr4aw/test_3_globalhell_jan_4th_jan_14th_80_85_northern/">3</a>, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/5eofjv/earthquake_california_50_14_days_11242016_dated/">2</a>, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/5dal9j/75_90_within_48_hours_likely_soon_11161118/">1</a>,</p>

<p>Note: this is more an assessment of data than a &#39;prediction&#39;. </p>

<p>So nothing was really changed since the initial assessment; Aside from the sunspot having maybe came 24-48 hours in advance. (Which is pretty good for a 2 week early warning). </p>

<p>Welp Lets see if we can add something to the books of seismology shall we! Sweet dealings <a href="/r/Conspiracy">/r/Conspiracy</a>. Looking forward to documenting the results as old sunspot 48 passes us for the last time prior to her decay !!! </p>

<p>Spot I am predicting to see the earthquake located in:
<a href="http://imgur.com/a/fWFl8">http://imgur.com/a/fWFl8</a></p>

<p>(Note could be south of ishinomaki by maybe 20 km). </p>

<p>Depth 38 - 60 km</p>

<p>RANGE OFF SHORE 40 - 60 km.</p>

<p>Size (again) 8.0- 8.5</p>

<p>Ok Lets do this reddit!</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> <strong>Conditions stable for test!!!</strong></p>

<p>HERE COMES THE SOLAR WIND (AGAIN): 2016 might get one more blast of auroras before the year is over.  Another stream of solar wind is heading for Earth, and it could arrive before New Year&#39;s Eve. The wind is flowing from a coronal hole (CH) in the sun&#39;s atmosphere, shown here in an image from NASA&#39;s Solar Dynamics Observatory:</p>

<p>NOAA forecasters estimate a 40% chance of polar geomagnetic storms on Dec. 30th when a co-rotating interaction region (CIR) is expected to hit Earth&#39;s magnetic field. CIRs are transition zones between slow- and fast-moving solar wind streams. Solar wind plasma piles up in these regions, producing density gradients and shock waves that do a good job of sparking auroras.</p>

<p>After the CIR arrives, a stream of fast-moving (600 km/s) solar wind will follow. The combined effect could produce G1-class geomagnetic storms (55% chance, says NOAA) and bright Arctic auroras on Dec. 31st. Happy New Year! Free: Aurora Alerts.</p>

<p>Where the white and red lines separate is usually where a large amount of the data suggest&#39;s an earthquake imo
Essentially we have something on the way. (Probably going to charge up a bit more throughout the next 24-48 hours. It is interesting though because I&#39;ve never seen such an unstable shock come in... So just noting that. 
Cheers and happy new years. We will see if this thing pans out ya ;)</p>

<p>Update 3: <strong>CRITICAL UPDATE</strong> <a href="http://spaceweather.com/images2017/01jan17/coronalhole_sdo_200.gif">http://spaceweather.com/images2017/01jan17/coronalhole_sdo_200.gif</a></p>

<p>Solar wind flowing from this major coronal hole should reach Earth on or about Jan 4th. Credit: NASA/SDO</p>

<p>We&#39;ve peached past 550, Expecting a little slow down to 440 prior to a near 600+ over the next 3 days. 
Let&#39;s see how japan fairs. </p>

<p><strong>Earthquake anytime from today (1/1/2017 -1/14/2017). Most likely between the 4th and 10th.</strong></p>

<p>(probably 8th at max).</p>

<p><a href="http://solarham.net/pictures/helio/jan1.jpg">Another look at 51.</a> 1/2/2017 (24 hrs until impact).</p>

<p><strong>This is my final update.</strong>
Noting that there may be a couple sizable fore-shocks (4 -6.0+ range) in the next 96 hrs... (south of location)</p>

<p>Also note Fiji Is looking rather unstable. 6.3 - This is an indication (in my opinion) the eastern pacific plate is now under an immense amount of pressure. As that pressure is released, expect to start seeing more northern activity. 
(in respects to the Honshu islands)- </p>

<p>Note Also: <a href="http://spaceweather.com/images2017/02jan17/ch_strip2.jpg">http://spaceweather.com/images2017/02jan17/ch_strip2.jpg</a>
A LARGE HOLE IN THE SUN&#39;S ATMOSPHERE: Stretching more than halfway across the face of the sun, a large hole in the sun&#39;s atmosphere is turning toward Earth.  NASA&#39;s Solar Dynamics Observatory photographed the yawning structure on Jan. 2nd:</p>

<p><strong>This is a &quot;coronal hole&quot;--a region in the sun&#39;s atmosphere where the magnetic field has opened up, allowing solar wind to escape.  A stream of solar wind flowing from this coronal hole could reach Earth as early as Jan. 4th (Jan. 5th is more likely), sparking G1-class geomagnetic storms.  Polar sky watchers should be alert for auroras later this week</strong></p>

<p><strong>Ok Final Final update: 1/03/2017</strong></p>

<p><strong>Updated analysis: January 6th</strong> 3:40 am Location: 38.540268, 142.058146 8.0+ range- (potential to be downgraded), 7.4 Depth 48km -56km 
(will happen most likely between 4th and 8th);</p>

<p>Likely 25% 3/11 tsunami associated; Deaths in 50 - 100. (if not 1000&#39;s). Life is cheeky, and finds a way, just as death does in that regard.

<p><strong>MAGNETIC STORMS LIKELY THIS WEEK:</strong> NOAA forecasters have boosted the odds of polar geomagnetic storms on Jan. 4th and 5th to 65% as a stream of solar wind approaches Earth. The hot wind is flowing from a large hole in the sun&#39;s atmosphere. This image, from NASA&#39;s Solar Dynamics Observatory, shows the yawning structure almost directly facing Earth on Jan. 3rd:</p>

<p>Coronal holes are regions where the sun&#39;s magnetic field peels back and allows solar wind to escape.  The stream of wind emerging from this coronal hole recently blew past NASA&#39;s STEREO-A spacecraft with peak speeds exceeding 700 km/s. Similar high speeds are likely when the stream reaches Earth on Jan. 4th and 5th.<br/>
Residents of the Arctic should expect G1-class geomagnetic storms and bright auroras in the nights ahead. Free: Aurora Alerts.</p>

<p><strong>ROLLING UPDATE 10:48am Pacific time:</strong>
1/05/2017
<strong>Another sizable fore-shock detected. SOLAR WINDS saw a 823 km/s (way high) (not good); I assess 24/78 hours until winds reach a holding speed and the big one occurs; Likely my final update-</strong>
<strong>PROOF OF TIMESTAMP</strong>
<a href="http://imgur.com/gallery/8NmPd">http://imgur.com/gallery/8NmPd</a></p>

<p><strong>ROLLING UPDATE 2 Critical IMO</strong> (TRACKING THIS 2 DAYS A LIL TIRED).
<a href="http://imgur.com/gallery/1RrfU">WHAT WE ARE LOOKING AT</a> TODAY 01/06/2017 TIME 10:32 am</p>

<p><strong>ROLLING UPDATE 3</strong></p>

<p><strong><a href="/u/KeyBlueRed">/u/KeyBlueRed</a> Points out the wsa-enil predictive model: <a href="http://www.swpc.noaa.gov/products/wsa-enlil-solar-wind-prediction">1</a>,</strong></p>

<p><strong>Stating we may be looking at as late 1/12/2017 so it could take until the full date range applied 13th -14th to witness a holding speed of 325</strong></p>

<p><strong>As CH51 passed onto the lens, (super-massive by comparison), I&#39;d assessed that 48 had already passed. I think the winds from CH51, essentially met up with 48&#39;s and the full force of both hit at approximately the same time. Note that once a first time journey is made, the other mass in transit can essentially follow its path, with much less resistance (Drafting it).</strong></p>

<p><em>Solar winds are much longer in duration than I myself expected. (I&#39;ve never seen this persistence in my years observing). I believe that the escalation in seismic events, and magnitudes are precursors to a very very sizable earthquake. Maybe an initial forecast is too low with a previous range estimated at 8.0 - 8.5; I imagine based on the data this will be more likely a larger earthquake then initially assessed, and I wanted to document the sighting for future researchers.</em> </p>

<p><strong>The initial winds should have been 550 at this time. Not 680 holding. I imagine they should decline soon? Maybe starting within a few hours... This could up the anti to a 50% tsunami, and an initial estimate from full 8.0 - 9.0 (Based on my previous solar wind observations). I imagine (should winds die down), that an earthquake will take place T-minus 60 hours time +/- when winds die down to 450 - 325km/s.  With a holding range at best 350 for a persistence of up to 12 hours holding. In my opinion the longer we &quot;charge&quot;. 
The Larger we quake. So stay safe Japan...</strong></p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> <em>multiple earthquakes are now taking place, in larger variety, and seismic value; We are getting closer by the hour in my opinion-</em> </p>

<p><strong>Note2</strong> <em>We hit Kp 7 Levels, 01/07/2017</em> <strong>That means the magnetosphere was temporarily breached</strong>

And were finally at 610 and declining in speed. Japan Stay safe :( </p>

<p><strong>A persistent solar wind stream above 650 km/s originating from coronal hole #51 continues to move past our planet and is expected to gradually decrease over the next 24 hours. The quiet period may be short lived however as another enhancement will be possible beginning January 11th thanks to coronal hole #52. Sky watchers at higher latitudes should remain alert for visible aurora for the remainder of the week.</strong></p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have sort of warned some of japan. (specifically tepco) to have extra generators nearby offsite; Encase of a tsunami with a wave height of +2.5 meters. (I assume a moderate tsunami warning is in effect for this e.q. prediction). As this should be a significant event; </p>

<p>Hoping people take precautions. 8.0 is about 4.0+ minutes of violent shaking; Hopefully the reactors are all ok and we pass this event without moderate associated damages. :)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, I hope you are right. </p>

<p>I remember when a tsunami hit a part of japan(not sure where), were a manufacturing site of Western Digital(Hard drives &lt;3) and also a nuclear power plant(not sure about this) were hit, but even if the power plant was hit, no nuclear waste affected the surrounding areas, which is good.  </p>

<p>I just hope they can recover from so many earthquakes and tsunamis(I hope this does not happen).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I tried to give a larger date frame this time to compete with the initial time loss of test 1 (28 hours). </p>

<p>This should certainly be bigger than the last and may accompany a small period of large aftershocks much like the initial 3/11 earthquake.</p>

<p>My advice is to simply use information to help members prepare encase an event does occur, and be prepared to help others if a tsunami does occur; I believe it will only be 25%-50% the 3/11 event had (if anything of comparison). I will have more information once the solar winds show their initial speed / vs impact; This is just fair warning that the region did stay stable and is earth centric / geo-effective; So in my opinion: we should expect the rest of the events to follow their initial pattern; i.e. (an impending earthquake) by that standard. :)</p>

<p>You should be ok where you are moscow. Likely some 6.0&#39;s at random in your area (following the big one) but they will fade to 4.0&#39;s and 3.0&#39;s rather quickly; until your back at your non-noticeable 1.2&#39;s - 1.0&#39;s events by the weeks end ;)</p>

<p>tl/dr
Essentially you may have a couple noticeable aftershocks; But they wont be dangerous in that regard</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think you might get more credit from the seismologic community if you gave further detailed evidence on how you make your location/depth determinations, and how that relates both to sunspots and the solar wind. </p>

<p>I&#39;m not knocking you - these folks are convinced only by hard evidence and reasoning. Right now, after 3 threads, it appears that the location choosing is still somewhat &quot;fuzzy&quot; - or at least more fuzzy than your rough formula for earthquake magnitude ((solar wind velocity / 10) =&gt; richter scale of quake).</p>

<p>That being said .. To me, at this point, you&#39;re looking like somewhat of an earthquake prophet. Keep on keepin&#39; on. A good track record speaks for itself - ask anyone who has ever created a new (useful) financial market indicator.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree; Its really seismology in addition to solar weather patterns. </p>

<p>I take areas showing high stress, with expectancy (being its time since an event) then use this in coordination with solar events; </p>

<p>So I wouldn&#39;t say I am a prophet, in any regard. </p>

<p>Any seismologist would tell you this area is likely to expect an earthquake soon; I am simply confirming that statement and giving an exact date range; This is literally using your own data in combination with my own theory; It is simply hard to explain it...</p>

<p>I follow world events, and earthquakes daily; Locating areas with swarming patterns, and estimate those in their frequency as well as backtracking records for their annual expectancy; (every 300 years etc); With the area in question near newyears for the last few years by example we have seen 7.0 activity; So in addition to the current solar winds, which I am expecting to see distributed to the planet; It makes this the primary probable location to prove the solar connection to seismic energy. </p>

<p>Remember I completely respect your world of seismology; I just don&#39;t think that earthquakes happen for no reason; And I certainly don&#39;t believe that the 7.3 last month was a rare aftershock of an earthquake that happened half a decade ago; If you want to talk about prophetic who-ha? are you guys serious? Are earthquake magic blessings from an invisible deity?  </p>

<p>Cause I base my theories on basic &#39;cause and effect&#39;-</p>

<p>Thanks for touching base; (and I don&#39;t mean to toss you into this as apart of them as a whole) but I get frustrated with seismology due to their posture on seismic / solar events; I sometimes wonder if its a variation of funding, an unknown area of study, or basic rejection in principal that compels them to taking such a stance. </p>

<p>being the relationship is being explored more intimately every day; 
Truly IRIS USGS, and METI need to have a solar center; Not because they need it; but because they need to rule it out ethically prior to having such an myopic opinion in itself;</p>

<p>Thanks for giving me the chance; I assure you; This is to improve the worlds understanding of seismicity; not to insult a field your passionate about. As I am myself very passionate, and truly only trying to assist all humanity by proving a theory that can aide it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;Prophet&quot; was a hyperbole - mostly meant to clarify my support for your process. Keep it up.</p>

<p>As far as seismologists are concerned - in the past when certain &quot;scientific truths&quot; as considered by the scientific community were up-ended by new and different theories  - there was significant pushback from the &quot;old school&quot; community - They have Ego&#39;s too, and many scientists think of themselves as smart - so they feel cognitive dissonance when an outsider with no experience comes up with something new and different. </p>

<p>Quantum Mechanics / String Theory had very similar resistance from the &quot;traditional&quot; physics community for quite a while, IIRC. That is until some experiments got funding and were tried - which led to more .. and more .. and more .. up until now, when Quantum Mechanics / String Theory is considered to be &quot;fact&quot; for the most part by the physics community.</p>

<p>I doubt mostly that I will ever be taken seriously (tests being of fully positive results or not) so of all things I simply make them public so that in time they may assist the researchers that will need these articles to help further the field in its proposal.

    <div class="md"><p>Yes actually. We had a 660 - 550 windstream; </p>

<p>Essentially there are multiple fractures in the earths surface; (faults). </p>

<p>Different faults allow for different seismic releases based on size and amount of time which it postulates. Lately there had been a build up of pressure, pressing the two plates in an amount of heavy tensions. (these create what are called micro quake swarms). </p>

<p>If the swarms are not able to relieve the bulk of pressure, and are actively (burping), while the earth then gets a belly full of energy. (think sick drunk getting a punch to the stomach) (burping being vomit point), and ya. What kind of party do you get in that scenario? Bleh is right. </p>

<p>There is a more technical explanation but its rather boring; You see seismology and solar eq&#39;s (at least to me) * And the bulk of them. Are closely related... 
What seismologists see and predict in relevant terms is. Build up of pressure. Highly probably area for eq. based on pressure, plate lock, micro swarms, or various other factors. 
To me the driving force behind that is the suns (sunspots and coronal hole / deposits)... 
So basically when seismologists were taking a look. In my opinion had they noted the rising solar winds at the time, their assessment could have been greatly based off the spiking solarwinds that week. </p>

<p>I did see them, but to be honest I am really tracking this mega quake that I feel will happen between my theories dates. I suppose I am basically trying to simply prove the relationship. SO everything I do is based off what I can roughly predict ahead of time, While proving the relationship beyond a doubt...</p>

<p>My main focus is to start at the top. (identifying the earths largest earthquakes), to show proof of concept; Which will hopefully influence the appropriate parties to start dialing in on the exact relationship between the two scientific fields...</p>

<p>basically you have to acknowledge that people go on and on, about this being &quot;magic, and Luck&quot;... So i&#39;ve been trying to prove beyond reasonable doubt the relationship does in fact exist. They you have test three in its waiting. Time will tell :) </p>

Update to Test 3 Japanese earthquake index; 8.0-8.5+ range quake. Jan 4th - 14th (self.conspiracy)
submitted 8 days ago * by GlobalHell
<a href="http://imgur.com/gallery/QUJzn">http://imgur.com/gallery/QUJzn</a>
Here she comes. (sunspot 48).
She is a little early, however she looks quite primed for a earth directed impact.
In the last two weeks it appears she&#39;s reached a level of complicity nearing her breakdown as expected.
I imagine Solar winds will easily reach up to 850km/s This will likely induce a planetary bell ringer. We may see elevated activity as soon as the first; But we are banking on the exiting winds to produce the predicted impact and its effects on our home planet;
I assess a 25% scale tsunami to be associated with this series from the (3/11) earthquake. Seismologists will state this is an aftershock from that earthquake. Don&#39;t buy that b.s. Were testing trumpet theory up in here-
So There you have it. My update as promised.
To learn more about my stupid ideas that are more seemingly showing positive results You can follow tests as they were in past succession.
Test 3, 2, 1,
Note: this is more an assessment of data than a &#39;prediction&#39;.
So nothing was really changed since the initial assessment; Aside from the sunspot having maybe came 24-48 hours in advance. (Which is pretty good for a 2 week early warning).
Welp Lets see if we can add something to the books of seismology shall we! Sweet dealings <a href="/r/Conspiracy">/r/Conspiracy</a>. Looking forward to documenting the results as old sunspot 48 passes us for the last time prior to her decay !!!
Spot I am predicting to see the earthquake located in: <a href="http://imgur.com/a/fWFl8">http://imgur.com/a/fWFl8</a>
(Note could be south of ishinomaki by maybe 20 km).
Depth 38 - 60 km
RANGE OFF SHORE 40 - 60 km.
Size (again) 8.0- 8.5
Ok Lets do this reddit!
UPDATE: Conditions stable for test!!!

HERE COMES THE SOLAR WIND (AGAIN): 2016 might get one more blast of auroras before the year is over. Another stream of solar wind is heading for Earth, and it could arrive before New Year&#39;s Eve. The wind is flowing from a coronal hole (CH) in the sun&#39;s atmosphere, shown here in an image from NASA&#39;s Solar Dynamics Observatory:
NOAA forecasters estimate a 40% chance of polar geomagnetic storms on Dec. 30th when a co-rotating interaction region (CIR) is expected to hit Earth&#39;s magnetic field. CIRs are transition zones between slow- and fast-moving solar wind streams. Solar wind plasma piles up in these regions, producing density gradients and shock waves that do a good job of sparking auroras.
After the CIR arrives, a stream of fast-moving (600 km/s) solar wind will follow. The combined effect could produce G1-class geomagnetic storms (55% chance, says NOAA) and bright Arctic auroras on Dec. 31st. Happy New Year! Free: Aurora Alerts.

Where the white and red lines separate is usually where a large amount of the data suggest&#39;s an earthquake imo Essentially we have something on the way. (Probably going to charge up a bit more throughout the next 24-48 hours. It is interesting though because I&#39;ve never seen such an unstable shock come in... So just noting that. Cheers and happy new years. We will see if this thing pans out ya ;)
Update 3: CRITICAL UPDATE <a href="http://spaceweather.com/images2017/01jan17/coronalhole_sdo_200.gif">http://spaceweather.com/images2017/01jan17/coronalhole_sdo_200.gif</a>

Solar wind flowing from this major coronal hole should reach Earth on or about Jan 4th. Credit: NASA/SDO
We&#39;ve peached past 550, Expecting a little slow down to 440 prior to a near 600+ over the next 3 days. Let&#39;s see how japan fairs.
Earthquake anytime from today (1/1/2017 -1/14/2017). Most likely between the 4th and 10th.
(probably 8th at max).
Another look at 51. 1/2/2017 (24 hrs until impact).
This is my final update. Noting that there may be a couple sizable fore-shocks (4 -6.0+ range) in the next 96 hrs... (south of location)
Also note Fiji Is looking rather unstable. 6.3 - This is an indication (in my opinion) the eastern pacific plate is now under an immense amount of pressure. As that pressure is released, expect to start seeing more northern activity. (in respects to the Honshu islands)-
Note Also: <a href="http://spaceweather.com/images2017/02jan17/ch_strip2.jpg">http://spaceweather.com/images2017/02jan17/ch_strip2.jpg</a> A LARGE HOLE IN THE SUN&#39;S ATMOSPHERE: Stretching more than halfway across the face of the sun, a large hole in the sun&#39;s atmosphere is turning toward Earth. NASA&#39;s Solar Dynamics Observatory photographed the yawning structure on Jan. 2nd:
This is a &quot;coronal hole&quot;--a region in the sun&#39;s atmosphere where the magnetic field has opened up, allowing solar wind to escape. A stream of solar wind flowing from this coronal hole could reach Earth as early as Jan. 4th (Jan. 5th is more likely), sparking G1-class geomagnetic storms. Polar sky watchers should be alert for auroras later this week

Ok Final Final update: 1/03/2017
Updated analysis: January 6th 3:40 am Location: 38.540268, 142.058146 8.0+ range- (potential to be downgraded), 7.4 Depth 48km -56km (will happen most likely between 4th and 8th);
Likely 25% 3/11 tsunami associated; Deaths in 50 - 100. (if not 1000&#39;s). Life is cheeky, and finds a way, just as death does in that regard. <a href="http://imgur.com/gallery/RjE7A">http://imgur.com/gallery/RjE7A</a>

MAGNETIC STORMS LIKELY THIS WEEK: NOAA forecasters have boosted the odds of polar geomagnetic storms on Jan. 4th and 5th to 65% as a stream of solar wind approaches Earth. The hot wind is flowing from a large hole in the sun&#39;s atmosphere. This image, from NASA&#39;s Solar Dynamics Observatory, shows the yawning structure almost directly facing Earth on Jan. 3rd:
Coronal holes are regions where the sun&#39;s magnetic field peels back and allows solar wind to escape. The stream of wind emerging from this coronal hole recently blew past NASA&#39;s STEREO-A spacecraft with peak speeds exceeding 700 km/s. Similar high speeds are likely when the stream reaches Earth on Jan. 4th and 5th.
Residents of the Arctic should expect G1-class geomagnetic storms and bright auroras in the nights ahead. Free: Aurora Alerts.
ROLLING UPDATE 10:48am Pacific time: 1/05/2017 Another sizable fore-shock detected. SOLAR WINDS saw a 823 km/s (way high) (not good); I assess 24/78 hours until winds reach a holding speed and the big one occurs; Likely my final update-</p>

    <div class="md"><p>tokyo would likely have a 40% seismic impact to 70% impact of the initial 3/11 earthquake in terms of (seismic p/s waves). </p>

<p>The tsunami there will likely be 10 - 25% the initial wave heights. So fairly well, but I am assessing a 8.2 - 8.5 range (or intensity 5) EQ. </p>

<p>So Stay on alert 72 hours. (which I feel is generous). Essentially Solar winds have elevated and maintained a highly dedicated windstream, in a longer duration. So If your new to japan this will probably be a frightening event. If you were in the november quake this will be 10% worse then that. If not 20%. </p>

<p>More than likely to take place within 72 hours. </p>

<p>Consider that if winds lower to 500- it is coming up, and 300+/- Begin to really really consider that any hour it can happen, and try to keep yourself out of situations that seem dangerous, in terms of a massive earthquake :) *Don&#39;t be afraid. Be prepared :)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes. I&#39;d assess 500- (more on this)...</p>

<p>Typically you will see a megaquake when winds fully calm. And planetary wind speeds cruise at their known stable levels. Between 250 - and - 350 Km/s. They essentially idle at that time...</p>

<p>When the winds calm for a few hours this is when the largest seismic events &quot;typically&quot; occur based on my independent research. :)</p>

<p>Noting that this is the same interval of timing we witnessed in the November event:<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/5dal9j/75_90_within_48_hours_likely_soon_11161118/?utm_content=title&amp;amp;utm_medium=user&amp;amp;utm_source=reddit&amp;amp;utm_name=frontpage">https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/5dal9j/75_90_within_48_hours_likely_soon_11161118/?utm_content=title&amp;amp;utm_medium=user&amp;amp;utm_source=reddit&amp;amp;utm_name=frontpage</a></p>

<p>I&#39;d assess a 8.0 - 8.5 is more than likely within t-minus 72 hours. 
(Just shortly after the winds reach a low level holding pattern. Say anywhere between an immediate reaction to 5 hours). </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Note:</p>

<p>Technically that is a misinterpretation. If winds shoot up. (fast rise) we typically see huge earthquakes as a direct response. If they hit a rise then make a free fall. We typically see a fast response... </p>

    <div class="md"><p>NO worries. </p>

<p>essentially its likely I should point out those speeds. 650 km/s</p>

<p>650,000 km in a second. </p>

<p>Vs holding speeds</p>

<p>280 Ish Thousand kilomoters a second...</p>

<p>Just saying cause the earth is massive, but that is a hell of a car wreck. Hence the forces that send shock waves to the planet. </p>

<p>Essentially its like a recycling program. Sun sends energy into planet. Energy is created in the impact. Shock waves occur on the plasma tubes I.e. Magnetosphere protecting the earth. These react against the magnetic harmony, via energy distribution. Energy excites magma (inner swelling), Pressure is released through faults. (sending out the complex materials). </p>

<p>Imo that is my theory, and what we are essentially testing today, and IMO its better then saying. &quot;Well seismologists are looking into the various elements of earthquakes wondering what create them&quot;. </p>

<p>I suspect the only force capable of creating most earthquakes, is a force larger then the earth itself...</p>

<p>Noting some earthquakes are created by fracking, and mega building. (causing pressure on faults), but to me that further concludes an external pressure component, which would be the primary cause of the largest seismic events on earth. </p>

<p>Probably heading back to bed. But again, If I were a gambling man 72 hour countdown, should be more then we need to see if this all checks out (for the third test) ;)</p>

<p>The information is essentially intended to provide comfort; It is the people on the beach by example keenly unaware, and not taking it into consideration, that I worry for the most. </p>

<p>If the tsunami is significant; Consider to travel south, shortly after the main shock occurs, (should a significant tsunami occur there is always the potential for fukushima Dainii and Daichii, to lose power and cooling; While this is being &quot;hyper paranoid&quot;, there is a potential. Base all aspects of these actions on the situation as it unfolds... I&#39;d assess at least 8 more hours, or more; (Based on the high winds we are witnessing now. Typically speeds will hold at 320 km/s +/- 100 (prior to the main foreshock), for a few hours. </p>

<p>The earths inner core / heartbeat is dictated by a beep on this channel:<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAcv7AUxja4">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAcv7AUxja4</a></p>

<p>The breaks in the beeping determine low km (250km depth + seismic activity)... When there are breaks in the sound, it is essentially a slight &quot;heart palpatism&quot;, which is indicative of a heart attack :/ </p>

<p>Another notable feature, is the tidal loss gain per day. There was a significant drop in levels, which also are attributed to large earthquakes (ahead of time), so the basic information; Appears to correspond with my own theories at this time. </p>

<p>Use the information, as an opportunistic, and optimist train of thought. As again. Most people don&#39;t have it, Can&#39;t find it, and will have no advanced warning at all. (While meanwhile), this seismology channel by example is on full alert, with a 24 hour warning issued. So in that extent, consider yourself far luckier then 99% of your nation. </p>

<p>It should also be notable, that Tokyo, will likely only have  a minute 7.0 range event, compared to northern japan (an 8.0), and most buildings and structures in japan (minus windows) are seismically prepared for these events. </p>

<p>The main thing to consider Is, have an exit plan and destination, for high ground; and watch out for obstacles such as power lines, and falling debris, should a significant earthquake occur. </p>

<p>You are far more prepared then anyone in your current nation. So consider that a godsend :)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I am finding it difficult to recover footage of the incident myself. The incident was:
X-FLARE: March 9th ended with a powerful solar flare. Earth-orbiting satellites detected an X1.5-class explosion from behemoth sunspot 1166 around 2323 UT. A movie from NASA&#39;s Solar Dynamics Observatory shows a bright flash of UV radiation plus some material being hurled away from the blast site:</p>

<p><strong>on that date we had a CME during peak maxima, leading up to the 3/11/2011 earthquake</strong></p>

<p>The obvious differences were that this event is a &quot;minima&quot; period, in which solar winds are dubbed &quot;slow winds&quot;, as sunspots have declined making coronal holes our &quot;fast winds&quot; / sources; </p>

<p>Notably it is Maxima that typically exerts &quot;fast winds&quot; incidents, which are mainly glancing or direct hit or miss incidents; But If I remember correctly, the visual appearances were stunningly similar; I am already speculating a higher range quake, if not a 7.0 soon to be followed by an even larger seismic event; </p>

<p>To me I believe this will be the worst seismic episode in Japan since 3/11 (based on the data alone), </p>

<p>I am unaware of there being a &quot;fore-shock&quot;, (to occur between now and the 12th in the 7.0 range) due to the immense amount of heightened activity; or if we should expect one megaquake to occur at a 8.5-9.0 range in spite of it; </p>

<p>To me, this wind pattern is a bad omen as to what is to come either way...</p>

<p>I think the other &#39;issue&#39; is that this data is from the Advanced Composition Explorer (ACE) spacecraft, meaning it wasn&#39;t recorded on Earth, so I&#39;m not sure how close or far away from Earth when it got its measurements. Whether this is an important factor or not, I&#39;m not sure.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;d more so be sure things like cabinets are secure, and to weary yourself from structures unsafe. Such as glass windows, etc. </p>

<p>The information is essentially intended to provide comfort; It is the people on the beach by example keenly unaware, and not taking it into consideration, that I worry for the most. </p>

<p>If the tsunami is significant; Consider to travel south, shortly after the main shock occurs, (should a significant tsunami occur there is always the potential for fukushima Dainii and Daichii, to lose power and cooling; While this is being &quot;hyper paranoid&quot;, there is a potential. Base all aspects of these actions on the situation as it unfolds... I&#39;d assess at least 8 more hours, or more; (Based on the high winds we are witnessing now. Typically speeds will hold at 320 km/s +/- 100 (prior to the main foreshock), for a few hours. </p>

<p>The earths inner core / heartbeat is dictated by a beep on this channel:<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAcv7AUxja4">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAcv7AUxja4</a></p>

<p>The breaks in the beeping determine low km (250km depth + seismic activity)... When there are breaks in the sound, it is essentially a slight &quot;heart palpatism&quot;, which is indicative of a heart attack :/ </p>

<p>Another notable feature, is the tidal loss gain per day. There was a significant drop in levels, which also are attributed to large earthquakes (ahead of time), so the basic information; Appears to correspond with my own theories at this time. </p>

<p>Use the information, as an opportunistic, and optimist train of thought. As again. Most people don&#39;t have it, Can&#39;t find it, and will have no advanced warning at all. (While meanwhile), this seismology channel by example is on full alert, with a 24 hour warning issued. So in that extent, consider yourself far luckier then 99% of your nation. </p>

<p>It should also be notable, that Tokyo, will likely only have  a minute 7.0 range event, compared to northern japan (an 8.0), and most buildings and structures in japan (minus windows) are seismically prepared for these events. </p>

<p>The main thing to consider Is, have an exit plan and destination, for high ground; and watch out for obstacles such as power lines, and falling debris, should a significant earthquake occur. </p>

<p>You are far more prepared then anyone in your current nation. So consider that a godsend :)</p>
