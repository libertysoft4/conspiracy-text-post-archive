    <div class="md"><p>It was ahead of its time, and it kind of shows how in the dark we were. It is excellent. Both a type of prophecy and a disclosure simultaneously. A time capsule that when years later , when there is enough awareness it can be opened and understood. That was his genius was his ability to bury encoded information in a plot so that the movie was two movies in one. I understand some of it. Like in The Shining how he encodes his involvement in the Apollo mission to the moon. And how Eyes wide Shut is a dual meaning of the world being blind to how people are being blinded and programmed by their handlers. How the perception is being shaped by the elite through mediums like movies. So he is also in a sense shutting his eye, or his eye that is his cameras eye.  His movie then becomes within his minds eye, in his experience, autobiographical, like you would recall a memory. And  Autobiographical and prophetic also in that his eyes are wide Shut, meaning he is dead. Maybe he knew he would be killed for doing the film.</p>

<p>And you are right, I am sure he had more in store for that film than the final edit showed.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This guy (link below) does some really good analysis of Kubrick films and others as well, if you read some of his articles in detail you&#39;ll get a good sense for the priming techniques that Kubrick used and you&#39;ll be able to spot them when you watch his films and films by other directors who use those techniques, though I don&#39;t know of many others who were as meticulous as Kubrick was in interweaving plot and subplot with the imagery on screen.</p>

<p>I posted it before because they use a lot of symbolism that can be found at various places, like CPP.  The Star and the Crescent, for example, is on their front sign, and it is also a symbol used by the Shriners.  The Shriners wear the fez and drive around in those miniature cars.  The Shriners are very well known for building and funding children&#39;s hospitals.  </p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PdC63zpC4VE">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PdC63zpC4VE</a></p>

<p>It is interesting that there is a person wearing the fez (about 1:27) in the Unusual as Usual video that was filmed at CPP.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Gusifer?</p>

<p>&quot;The letter &quot;G&quot; figures prominently in Freemasonry.  In the lower degrees, the initiate is told that this letter stands for &quot;God&quot; and for &quot;Geometry&quot;, which the Supreme Architect of the Universe used to design this wonderful Cosmos.  However, occultist, and 33rd Degree Mason, Arthur Waite, quotes Eliphas Levi [also 33rd Degree], telling us that the letter &quot;G&quot; stands for Venus, and that Venus&#39; symbol is a lingam, a stylized phallis. [Masonic author, Arthur Edward Waite, The Mysteries of Magic: A Digest of the Writings of Eliphas Levi , Chicago, , DeLaurence, Scott, and Company, 1909, p. 217]</p>

<p>The greatest Masonic author of all time, Albert Pike, agrees. He states [page 631-32 in Morals and Dogma ] that the Monad [#1] is male, and the Duad [#2] is female.  Their sexual union produces the Triad [#3], which is &quot;represented by the letter &#39;G&#39;, the generative principle&quot;.  This term, &quot;generative principle&quot;, is code for the sex act.&quot;</p>

<p>Compare these two images:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.cuttingedge.org/Masonic_Emblem_Stylelized%20Seattle.gif">Pic of Masonic square and compass separated by a G</a></p>

<p><a href="http://tracytwyman.com/wp-content/uploads/tumblr_o0hcvsIf5A1u9yvzjo1_500.jpg">Pic of Nu And Set being separated from sex</a></p>

<p>Egyptian myth of Nu and Set, were Nu(night) and Set(day) are locked in a sexual embrace. Their separation created a division between light and dark. A myth for how there is even a day and night, personified in man and natures symbiosis.</p>

<ul>
<li>This is also why you see a black and white checkerboard floor in some the images of the mason symbol. The light and dark principle.</li>
</ul>

<p>But the similarities are there. Only the masons use a compass to represent Nu, a square for Set, and a &#39;G&#39; for the &quot;generative principle/phallus/sex.</p>

<p>It&#39;s the same myth hidden in plain site.</p>

<p>That&#39;s why it&#39;s Gusifer. Or Lucifer with a G. </p>

<p>More info about the Masonic symbolism:
<a href="http://www.cuttingedge.org/free16.htm">http://www.cuttingedge.org/free16.htm</a></p>

<p>So ask, why is an orphanage/adoption agency called Gusifer? Because it is a code for Sex with the children. Shame on you Podestas!</p>

<p>Correlation does not imply causation. The symbolism of the Nu/Set myth is not part of the Judeo-Christian canon. Especially since the Egyptians gods were idol worship, and Judeo-Christianity is monotheism.  </p>

<p>Albert Pike, along with Arthur Waite, were postulating what &quot;G&quot; meant. Being a 33rd Degree mason is irrelevant - in this position, their motivation was to sell books. It was huge at the time to link Freemasonry with the Occult, it was a means of the public &quot;understanding&quot; things. The Taxil Hoax is a great example of this. </p>

<p>So what does &quot;G&quot; mean? &quot;Geometry&quot;, most likely. Why? Because in addition to the Freemasons literally being the first trade union ever, numbers had a very special status in Egyptian mythology, Judeo-Christian beliefs, and New Age Occultism. Even today, people try to find relevance in the numbers. </p>

<p>The top level of Freemasonry is Master Mason, 3rd Degree. If you want to be a Shriner or York/Scottish Rite, cool. But it doesn&#39;t make a difference in the official teachings. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>In this , using myth, correlation does imply causation because myth is from which other belief systems spring. So just like Christianity has its similarities to the osiris myth, so does freemasonry have its root in myths that came before. In this way you can trace them back.</p>

<p>If anything is conflated ,it is freemasonry itself.</p>

<p>But look at it this way, we have millions of beliefs, but only very few belief systems. Only ten belief systems from which cause countless variations.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Cool. So why are we disagreeing? I forgot.</p>

<p>And Jews and Christians do worship idols though, don&#39;t they? Let&#39;s figure this out. Christ is idol worship. Jesuits worship the sun/son. The Romans actually switched the first day of the week from Saturday to Sunday; church is on Sunday, etc. The sun being another idol to worship which has been around of course in Egypt already prior, and prior to that it was worshipped, probably forever in some form. It&#39;s really nothing new, just the idols change personas.</p>

<p>So does the significance. Saturn day becomes sort of a Sabbath switch. The Jews still hold their Sabbath on Saturn day. And then we know the idol they worship.</p>

<p>While I&#39;m on it it&#39;s interesting to note that 9/11 happened on a Tuesday. Which is Mars day. The God of war.</p>

<p>But just in the beliefs about arbitrary days of the week are encoded meanings derived from ten core beliefs, particularly myth. And in magick those symbols are used in operations to reinforce the belief. It&#39;s really that simple. But in the grand scheme of things they mean nothing. Arbitrary ideas invented by man about his place in nature. They only have power and significance is one believes they do, as they hold no absolute knowledge about reality. So in a sense all of our current idols are false, but held as truth. That&#39;s how I look at.</p>

But yea, since that is the pool from we draw from it boils down to which side you are on. It&#39;s very black and white, like the checkerboard floor of the masons.

<p>And if you are the one who gets to edit the bible, ...you must feel like a God. But I wonder how much of it is confirmation bias? What do we do with it now? Not like we could ever make much sense of it, flawed by its own implicit and absolute guidelines, obscured by its own conflation.</p>

<p>It&#39;s only a matter of time until it is totally irrelevant, like a photo that fades to invisible. I&#39;m very curious to what comes next, I don&#39;t think another God or crucifixion myth is probable in our timeline, do you see us shifting backwards to more dogma? I don&#39;t. But I can start to see a picture being formed of a type of revolution happening.</p>

<p>The thing about energy is you can&#39;t force it. You can&#39;t put a square peg in a round hole... unless you are a master mason, then still you have to assimilate both into an amalgam. </p>

<p>The world isn&#39;t ready for destabilization of the nationalism of each country. At least not for a hundred years most likely, and in a natural progression. Not a forced one like any new world order Soros Inc has in mind. When you force energy it naturally follows the laws of physics and produces an equal and opposite reaction. There is your revolution. Like I said I can&#39;t stop him, but he will fail because his intentions are personal and not collective. And as individuals will start to see, a choice will be made for what type of world we choose to create, already with the loss of Hillary the world moves in that direction of not letting oligarchs be dictators. </p>

<p><a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-25757218">http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-25757218</a></p>

<p>The allegations were investigated and covered up in some cases for over 30 years.</p>

<p>&quot;In one, four Dublin archbishops were found to have in effect turned a blind eye to cases of abuse from 1975 to 2004.</p>

<p>A fresh scandal erupted in March 2010 when it emerged the head of the Irish Catholic Church, Cardinal Sean Brady, was present at meetings in 1975 where children signed vows of silence over complaints against a paedophile priest, Fr Brendan Smyth. This prompted Pope Benedict XVI to apologise to Irish victims.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Reacting to the UN report in February, Barbara Blaine, the president of Snap (Survivors Network of those Abused by Priests), said it was clear that the Vatican had put the reputation of Church officials above protection of children.</p>

<p>&quot;Despite all the rhetoric from Pope Francis and Vatican officials, they refuse to take action that will make this stop.&quot; she said.&quot;</p>

<p>Have I sued anyone? No.</p>

<p>Am I stopping fellow citizens from investigating this issue? Fuck no.</p>

<p>You really think its easy for victims to come forward?</p>

Monday&#39;s child is fair of face,

    <div class="md"><p>I was talking about Venus in this thread, but check this out, the etymology(origin) of the word Friday:</p>

<p>&quot;Old English Frīgedæg ‘day of Frigga,’ named after the Germanic goddess Frigga, wife of the supreme god Odin and goddess of married love; translation of late Latin Veneris dies ‘day of Venus,’ Frigga being equated with the Roman goddess of love, Venus. Compare with Dutch vrijdag and German Freitag&quot;</p>

<ul>
<li>But in this context it means either Child Love, Or Loving a Child. The only thing that makes it suspect is that instead of calling it one thing they hide it behind symbolism calling it &#39;Fridays Child&#39;. So if their hiding the meaning they are hiding something else, imo.</li>
</ul>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s from the poem, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monday%27s_Child"><em>Monday&#39;s Child</em>.</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Monday&#39;s child is fair of face,</p>

<p>Tuesday&#39;s child is full of grace,</p>

<p>Wednesday&#39;s child is full of woe,</p>

<p>Thursday&#39;s child has far to go,</p>

<p>Friday&#39;s child is loving and giving,</p>

<p>Saturday&#39;s child works hard for a living,</p>

<p>But the child who is born on the Sabbath day</p>

<p>Is bonnie and blithe and good and gay.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The poem and its respective days of the week are often used to refer to children. (e.g. <a href="http://digitalcommons.law.scu.edu/lawreview/vol40/iss1/7/">this text</a> refers to an embryo as a &quot;Thursday&#39;s child [has far to go]&quot;)</p>

<p>Apparently, there has been some variation in the days of the week:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Despite modern versions in which &quot;Wednesday&#39;s child is full of woe,&quot; an early incarnation of this rhyme appeared in a multi-part fictional story in a chapter appearing in Harper&#39;s Weekly on September 17, 1887, in which &quot;Friday&#39;s child is full of woe&quot;, perhaps reflecting traditional superstitions associated with bad luck on Friday – as many Christians associated Friday with the Crucifixion.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>An example of &quot;Friday&#39;s child is full of woe&quot; comes in the <em>Star Trek: The Original Series</em> episode simply titled, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friday&#x27;s_Child_(Star_Trek:_The_Original_Series)"><em>Friday&#39;s Child</em>.</a></p>

<p>&quot;Wednesday&#39;s child [is full of woe]&quot; has been used by various adoption related organizations. A simple search for &quot;Wednesday&#39;s child adoption&quot; on your favorite search engine will yield multiple results. </p>

<p>Given the context, the most likely explanation is that they chose &quot;Friday&#39;s Child&quot; for the same reason other adoption organizations have chosen &quot;Wednesday&#39;s Child&quot;.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It was ahead of its time, and it kind of shows how in the dark we were. It is excellent. Both a type of prophecy and a disclosure simultaneously. A time capsule that when years later , when there is enough awareness it can be opened and understood. That was his genius was his ability to bury encoded information in a plot so that the movie was two movies in one. I understand some of it. Like in The Shining how he encodes his involvement in the Apollo mission to the moon. And how Eyes wide Shut is a dual meaning of the world being blind to how people are being blinded and programmed by their handlers. How the perception is being shaped by the elite through mediums like movies. So he is also in a sense shutting his eye, or his eye that is his cameras eye.  His movie then becomes within his minds eye, in his experience, autobiographical, like you would recall a memory. And  Autobiographical and prophetic also in that his eyes are wide Shut, meaning he is dead. Maybe he knew he would be killed for doing the film.</p>

<p>And you are right, I am sure he had more in store for that film than the final edit showed.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Really? You as much said it in your article. Saturn. Satan. Baal. Whatever, Moloch. Take your pick. It&#39;s not that hard to discern they actually idolize the symbol of Saturn.</p>

<p>Eliphas Levi, a Jewish Kabbalist, was the one who created the famous Baphomet, which you quoted myself in your article. Make this connection and you have it. I&#39;m not an anti Semite, but Jews run Hollywood and music and it&#39;s how they worship their idol through that medium. Why do you think satanism is even a thing? Most Satanists themselves don&#39;t even know it&#39;s a Jewish propagation.</p>
