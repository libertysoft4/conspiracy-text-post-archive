        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>A friend of mine is convinced that planes weren&#39;t used in the attacks on 9/11 in New York. He believes that missiles or some other weaponry was used and that the footage circulated of the &quot;planes&quot; is doctored footage. He implies that everybody who says that it was planes is lying.</p>

<p>We both agree that the US government was definitely aware and had something to do with the attacks before they occured.</p>

<p>I believe that it was planes used and now I&#39;m confused. What&#39;s the consensus here on r/conspiracy? Am I wrong for believing that the attacks in New York were achieved with planes? If I am, could you please show me some evidence to change my mind? If I am not, could you please provide me with some evidence that I can show my friend?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m with you here. I&#39;ve watched the footage over and over, all of it that is available, and it stands to reason that the towers were not brought down by planes alone. Maybe planes did crash into the buildings, but that&#39;s not what brought them down. </p>

<p>The buildings were constructed with the support on the exterior of the buildings, not in the interior around elevator shafts. Strongest steel in the world. Narrow windows as a result. How a plane could have made it all the way through that steel cage with its intact nose coming out of the other side, it doesn&#39;t compute. </p>

<p>And, some months prior, a bomb went off in the basement of one of them, and the building was sound. How did they crumble from being crashed into at the top? It just does not make sense. People call me crazy for this, too. </p>

<p>There&#39;s no way to doctor all of the footage... Not to have itall the same. but I don&#39;t think the pentagon was hit by a plane. The hole doesn&#39;t fit, the debris field doesn&#39;t fit.

    <div class="md"><p>they needed a narrative about plane attacks. the WTC impacts are very iconic. I think they knew to have an actual plan hit where they wanted it to at the pentagon would be next to impossible to pull off so they worked within their means of executing the plan to go off without a hitch. </p>

<p>a common question people ask is &quot;why would they do X when Y seems to be less suspicious&quot; </p>

<p>these nefarious actors know that they can sell whatever story (lie) to the American public through the media. control that, and most people won&#39;t think twice because they saw it on the <em>news</em>. </p>

<p>the minority who have questions are easily mocked and ridiculed. and this is where we find ourselves now </p>

    <div class="md"><p>No planes. The Wile E Coyote &quot;impact&quot; shape was cut out using thermite and the explosions were pyro -- see the Israeli art team, &quot;Gelatin&quot; and their project &quot;The B Thing&quot;. The planes were computer graphics -- bad CGI, at that -- and audio superimposed on footage.</p>

<p>Just think: If you wanted to reproduce the impact scene for a Hollywood movie, and you only had ONE TAKE, how would you do it? It&#39;s important to note that that nobody had camera phones in 2001 and Youtube did not exist for video distribution, so the media/information sphere was fairly easy to control. (It&#39;s interesting to think... There was only a narrow window of time where 9/11 was possible -- they needed computer graphics to be advanced enough, but technology not so far advanced that everybody could record and distribute their own footage.)</p>

<p>The towers were demolished using subterranean nukes, as was their design.</p>

<p>The Pentagon was hit by an anti-ship Soviet-era Granit P-700 cruise missile stolen from the Kursk.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I used to think that planes crashed into the buildings but that they were brought down with demolition charges (nano-thermite, etc.). But then I watched the documentary &#39;September Clues&#39; and it completely changed my mind. The guy who made the video basically goes through the footage shot from all the different angles and shows that: </p>

<p>1) In many cases it was cleverly edited to look like a different vantage point while actually being the same. </p>

<p>2) The so-called &#39;independent&#39; videos come from questionable sources, usually show clear evidence of CGI, and usually do not match up with the other footage (like the plan approaching from a very different angle). </p>

<p>I suggest watching the video with an open but critical mind. It changed my view of what happened and made me realize just how complicit our news media was in creating the 9/11 myth. </p>

<p>I&#39;m not sure I agree with all the conclusions reached in September Clues, but it was enough to convince me that there weren&#39;t any planes that day. And from an operational perspective, it makes complete sense, as it would really leave too wide a margin of error. </p>

<p>If you want to discuss anything after watching the video, feel free to PM me. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>First of all many of the stories you linked to do not say they saw planes. The say things like &quot;I knew it had to be a plane&quot; and &quot;I saw the fire and smoke...not knowing that it was an airplane...&quot;</p>

<p>Second, you are far too credulous. Who are these alleged witnesses and what reason do we have to think that any of them are real people with real stories. If you gave me a few days I could write hundreds of eye-witness stories and make up a bunch of names. </p>

<p>You have to go back to the day itself. And when you do that, you find that all of the eye witnesses interviewed worked for the news networks. People like the infamous <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5y8PtfKA14">&quot;Harley guy&quot;</a> with his obviously scripted narrative. You will also find people who said they <em>did not</em> see an airplane. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hardly anonymous when they willingly list their names. The burden of proof is on you to prove those diaries are fake by contacting the names and asking if they gave that testimony. I&#39;m sure there are many, many more published testimonies. Or watch David Vanadia&#39;s (or others&#39;) raw footage of interviews of people on the street just after planes crashed. Many said they &quot;SAW&quot; the plane fly in and crash into the building. While doubt can reasonably be casted on specifics (color, size, time, etc), the burden of proof is on you to prove those people are all lying or mistaken about what they saw. Way more &quot;evidence&quot; there were actually flying objects that flew into one or both buildings than it being CGI. Get your head of the sand.</p>

<p>I’m David Vanadia, an Italian-American storyteller and teacher.... Since 1995, I have performed original stories in the United States and abroad at schools, bars, coffeehouses, clubs and festivals including the Digital Storytelling Festival and the Yukon International Storytelling Festival. </p>

<p>As a narrative practitioner, I employ an interdisciplinary approach to storytelling that incorporates writing, performing, teaching, organizing live events, folklore, multimedia, documentation, and facilitating narrative environments.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Here are two comments on the video you linked to that pretty much sum things up:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Another fake video released 10 years later by a “professional” bullshit artist.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>i note a ‘witness ’ who claimed that they saw writing on the bottom of the plane as it zoomed above the staten island ferry</p>

<p>so far as I am aware there is NO writing on the underside of a plane and anyway if this plane existed and was travelling at 550 mph would have past in a flash</p>

<p>i suspect that many of the supposed eye witnesses to this false flag event are simply plants (Harley man)</p>

<p>in fact the Russian proverb. ‘He lied like an eye witness’ sums it up</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I didn&#39;t really consider the idea that the planes may not have been used until I watched September Clues (I&#39;m probably not the first person to bring it up here). This documentary did a great job pointing out major inconsistencies/issues with footage. The whole doc is a case against the planes. </p>

<p>I haven&#39;t made up my mind about this idea yet but this it helped me understand the the arguments against the planes and the evidence it was based off of. It&#39;s interesting at the very least. </p>

<p>Here is a chunk of it. If you like this, watch the full piece. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXI8lnqEahQ">talk</a> from Philip Marshall seems to make a lot of sense. He was a pilot who said he wanted to do something about 9/11 but instead he supposedly commit suicide, killed his family and dog.</p>

<p>The big thing I take away from his talk is that 9/11 was mostly real with actual planes. I don&#39;t remember if he mentions controlled demolition for the towers, but for him the smoking gun is the stand down order from Cheney. Two of the flights were delayed 30 minutes and the air force did nothing to stop them.</p>

<p>Coincidentally these are the planes that didn&#39;t hit the towers, the ones that a lot of conspiracy theorists say didn&#39;t exist at all. But if you think about it, it makes perfect sense that there would be disinfo about the planes that are the smoking gun of 9/11.   </p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you believe that no planes were used, then you also have to believe that all of the footage of the South Tower impact is CGI. If they can produce CGI good enough to fool everyone (most people, whatever) then I think it&#39;s a pretty logical assumption that they could have done the same with the Pentagon. </p>

<p>The lack of Pentagon footage is something that many people point to that suggests a cover up. If they can do South Tower from 50, 60, 70 angles, then they could have done better than the 5 frames of nothing released &#39;showing&#39; &#39;flight 77&#39;.</p>

<p>Check out Richard D Hall&#39;s work on the no plane theory. He believed it, but checked the videos against radar and even though the angles all look different, they&#39;re not. </p>

<p>Having said all of that, the analysis that shows a pixel-perfect nose reappear through the other side of the building is, to say the least, interesting. </p>

<p>Do I think there were planes? In NYC, yes. Do I think they were the passenger jets hijacked in Boston? Not at 500+mph I don&#39;t. (Please don&#39;t come back with &quot;but what happened to the passengers?&quot; like it disproves something. It does not.)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The impact at the Pentagon would only have been visible to a few hundred people on the highway and in the air force building.   There&#39;s no reason to think any of them would have a camera pointed at the pentagon at that instant.  It&#39;s not like in NY where the building was visible to millions and the building next to it was on fire.  It&#39;s perfectly reasonable to expect a few dozen of those people to point a camera in that direction.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I meant if there actually isn&#39;t any real CCTV footage (lots of cameras facing), then it should be pretty easy to doctor at least one 1fps video to keep us quiet, if they could doctor 50+ 24fps videos. </p>

<p>Unless of course you believe the hologram plane thing. I&#39;m not convinced of that though. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Surveillance cameras are usually pointed at the ground surrounding the building to catch vandals and intruders, they aren&#39;t there to see approaching aircraft.   They also often pan back and forth, so it&#39;s not that unreasonable to believe that only one camera caught whatever hit the pentagon.  </p>

<p>Rich Hall is still a no planer btw.  He thinks there was an &quot;invisible&quot; stealth craft projecting the a hologram of the object that everyone saw fly into the towers.  That    He talks about it at the end of <a href="https://youtu.be/rLIcIFCmBZc">this video.</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>Just to clarify, my original point was that I don&#39;t think the videos are CGI! I wasn&#39;t talking about holograms!</p>

<p>Good point about where the cameras would be pointed, but they confiscated 80 something CCTV tapes.</p>

<p>Even if they didn&#39;t catch anything on those, I think my point is still valid: if they could CGI planes on loads of 24fps videos they could easily knock up a bullshit Pentagon video (filmed on a different day blah blah).</p>

<p>Rich Hall has bought into Dr Judy Wood&#39;s energy beam thing, which I&#39;m not a fan of because it kinda ignores all the eyewitness testimony of explosions. What I do like about Rich Hall is that he&#39;s willing to change his stance on something if there&#39;s enough evidence to support it (anyone interested in the Madeline McCann case should definitely check out his videos).  But for me the no planes theory is a little too speculative. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Judy Wood thinks that the &quot;explosions&quot; are boilers and water tanks blowing up as the steel is disintegrated by the energy weapon.  The theory does cover most of the available evidence, but you are right that it requires believing the existence of unproven weapons systems. </p>

<p>It&#39;s not that much of a stretch to think that governments may have developed something like that in secret though.  The US alone has billions in black budget spending every year.  They have sent up &quot;top secret&quot; satellites in the shuttle numerous times.  It&#39;s possible they have done something more than just improve fighter jets, subs, and aircraft carriers over the last 70 years.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not that much of a stretch I agree. I&#39;m sure the black budget has come up with all kinds of craziness over the years...</p>

<p>I&#39;m not going to come out and say that it DEFINITELY wasn&#39;t holograms and energy weapons, because I can&#39;t. I don&#39;t know that with any degree of certainty. All I do know is that the official story is so full of holes it that the Omission Report might as well be made out of Swiss Cheese 😉</p>
