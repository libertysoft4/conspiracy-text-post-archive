All of the people saying pizzagate is a hoax, and feel you have looked into it enough to make that assumption, I say you should also reserch the franklin coverup, and watch a documentary called A Conspiracy of Silence. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>No. Pizzagate was not the Franklin cover up before pizzagate was around.</p>

<p>The Franklin scandal was the Franklin scandal, still is. Stop lumping all of them together.</p>

<p>By putting all of these topics together under the pizzagate umbrella do you think it helps? It doesn&#39;t.</p>

<p>And here&#39;s a big difference between pizzagate and all the other pedophile scandals. Pizzagate has no victims coming out. Every other pedophile scandal had victims coming out, even if the reports were being buried. </p>

The treasure trove of sealed grand jury testimony of the franklin files would be a good place to start for the republican pedos.Haiti and the Clinton Foundation, Clinton Global Initiative for democrat side.

<p>The FBI trashed their reputation with the coverup of the franklin files. They need to be a part of it but another agency needs to come in that can be trusted.

<p>I read today that a couple was found with a 4 year old girl duct-taped and put into a trash-bag locked in a closet. Sadly our justice system requires you just about to catch the abuser mid-rape or abuse to even have a case. </p>

<p>A kid coming forward and blaming the accuser is not enough in this justice system. Even more so the more powerful and rich the perpetrator is. So even if victims come forward they are going to meet critical folks like you who would rather dismiss a claim than investigate it. And then get shutdown by the crooked pedo&#39;s in the DOJ.</p>

<p>Seriously if you want to have a discussion about this have a real discussion. Standing around asking for proof does nothing when the justice system covers up said proof. That is pizzagate, the cover-up of high profile pedophile accusations and outright criminal behavior.</p>

<p>I&#39;m well aware of who Epstein is.  Victims of his have come forward.  How many victims of Silsby, Podesta, Alefantis, Brock, or any others involved in PG come out?</p>

<p>Just because it&#39;s happened before does not validate Pizzagate.  Give me names of people that have been implicated in both, then you&#39;ll have a link.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>When there&#39;s evidence of a specific crime having been committed.  Pizzagate says the crime is pedophilia.  Ok, so who were the victims?  Where and when did these crimes take place?</p>

<p>Investigating into Silsby and Haiti, sure, even though it&#39;s already been done.  She was imprisoned in Haiti for 6 months after trafficking charges were lowered to improper travel or something.  She currently works in Idaho for AlertSense, a software company, as the VP of Marketing.</p>

<p>What does that have to do with Pizzagate?  Also, link?  I&#39;d like to see this case as I feel this couple should at least get child abuse/neglect.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>That&#39;s just plain false.  I&#39;ve been very receptive to information with Pizzagate and I look into it.  It also falls apart rather quickly, like the code words that originate from 4chan and urban dictionary.  A kid coming forward would be HUGE right now.  This movement is massive and if a kid came out, the house of cards would crumble pretty quickly.  But we&#39;re still waiting....</p>

<p>The justice system has covered up things related to Pizzagate?  I don&#39;t mean with the Franklin Scandal, with Epstein, Hastert, Penn State, etc.  I mean pure Pizzagate.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>edit: 9/11 has proof out the ass that it wasn&#39;t a fucking plane that made that building collapse and still nothing happens. Do not be fooled that proof will somehow make every crooked fuck see the light.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes, 9/11 has proof that 2 planes didn&#39;t cause 3 buildings to collapse.  To say nothing happens is incorrect as people are still fighting to this day for truth about what happened on 9/11.  A huge difference between 9/11 and pizzagate is that we can even take <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUVV3sc8994">the official story</a> for 9/11 to see that things don&#39;t add up.</p>

<p>Another huge difference is that 9/11 was a singular event.  Pizzagate is not.  Pizzagate is internet conjecture.</p>

Toddler in a trashbag.. How i Found it?? I googled &quot;taped children&quot; and boy was I fucking surprised. Although it was image search because someone wanted to argue that taping children is a meme.</p>

<p>Bro let me link you something, some of mitt romney&#39;s teen camps  a worker there described children as pizza. And I&#39;m really fucking surprised you don&#39;t know MAP = Minor attracted person. Really how fucking uneducated are you?</p>

<p>I was here when the spirit cooking video was released and the emails first were released.  I&#39;ve been here 4 years.  It was pizzagate, always was.</p>

<p>While those parents are fucking disgusting, it&#39;s an isolated incident of parents abusing their own child.  What does it have to do with Pizzagate?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Instead of the pizza coming to you we’ll come and pick the pizza up and take it and let it get cooked for a while, in a sense. Until it’s ready to come home and then you get a brand new hot pizza</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Could it just be a metaphor?  Is anything that has to do with pizza automatically pedophilia?  What happened to those kids is fucked up, for sure.  But what connection does it have to Pizzagate?  Just because it&#39;s happened before does not mean pizzagate is another case of it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well that was to directly rebuke the claim many skeptics say that pizza related language originated on 4chan. No sir it&#39;s been around awhile. Minor attracted people have tried to normalize their habits since the internets conception. Child porn is fucking rampart as fuck on image boards, that doesn&#39;t mean 4chan isn&#39;t reliable. I can link you to a message board right now that uses state&#39;s to describe certain cp for trading. Just name&#39;s and states. </p>

<p>Just keep in mind that while you may be doing all of this to help children, people such as myself that oppose it (because we&#39;re unconvinced, not shills or trolls) are passionate about the conspiracy community not becoming more of a laughing stock and to prevent innocent people from being imprisoned.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Understood and I echo that sentiment 100%. I was quick to judge you on how long you have been researching. What I get ticked about is that a million other conspiracies have been around. </p>

<p>In fact the same theory has been around since the 80&#39;s. The pushback they give this on the media now a days is just so suspicious. </p>

<p>One question before I stop harassing you. Have you been keeping up with the where is eric braverman videos? There was also another Laura silsby connection a small one but yea... </p>

<p>Dyncorp is linked to tillerson. A cabinet member pick of trump. And Feinburg(Dyncorp) is a top trump advisor. old news though. 
Yet republicans have done a good job making it look like a hillary and co operation when I believe it involves much more.</p>

<p>Here is part 1 of 3 part pizzagate investigation he did. And is very detailed.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Stuff can be happening to a kid and they would have so many reasons not to say anything. I was trafficked for years as an elementary school aged kid and no one would have known. People know how to leave minimal evidence and traffickers aren&#39;t stupid. </p>

<p>And if some of the kids are here illegally and their home countries are very far away, there might not be anyone looking for them. That&#39;s the sad truth.</p>

<p>It may be that without a victim there is no crime, according to law. And maybe most people looking into pizzagate wouldn&#39;t know how to conduct an entire investigation, but can&#39;t you see that these people are genuinely concerned? They&#39;re not just talking about it to be dicks. </p>

<p>Some aren&#39;t, some are.  Can&#39;t speak for everyone in the movement one way or the other.</p>

<p>We have no evidence of any child related crime when it comes to Pizzagate outside of Silsby in Haiti.  Not one single crime.  There&#39;s speculation, that&#39;s it.  And that speculation stems from 4chan and urbandictionary &quot;code words&quot; and instagram posts of people&#39;s lives that other people don&#39;t understand.</p>

<p>Steven Avery and Brendan Dassey are well aware of that, and they were imprisoned due to circumstantial evidence, nothing directly implicating them</p>

<p>West Memphis Three?  They probably didn&#39;t kill that kid, I think it was the kid&#39;s step father</p>

<p>The last paragraph is pretty indicative of her (is she the one that claims Hillary raped her?)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Religious and political scholars have criticized O&#39;Brien&#39;s claims for their lack of any supporting evidence. David G. Robertson characterized them as symptomatic of &quot;baseless&quot; moral panic and noted that &quot;no-one has ever been prosecuted of such crimes nor has any corroborating material evidence ever been produced&quot;.[8] According to scholar Michael Barkun, &quot;scholarly and journalistic treatments of MK-ULTRA make no mention of a Project Monarch&quot;. Barkun describes O&#39;Brien&#39;s account as &quot;sensational even by the standards of conspiracy literature&quot; and notes that even black helicopter conspiracy theorist Jim Keith considers it &quot;fraudulent or delusional&quot;.[5] Jodi Dean cited O&#39;Brien&#39;s claims as an example of conspiracy theorists tendency to excessive &quot;leaps in imagination and willingness to deviate from common sense&quot;.[9]</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Human makes mistake?</p>

<p>And I really don&#39;t understand the &quot;until&quot; pizzagate. Pizzagate is not just about the emails or Comet Ping Pong and/or James Alefantis anymore.</p>

<p>Pizzagate is now the name for the investigation that followed the discoveries made in the Podesta emails.</p>

<p>Pizzagate in itself is now about a global elite sex ring... And just like the Franklin Scandals and others prove, these things does exist.</p>

<p>Pizzagate is the investigation trying to make public a newly discover massive child sex ring and it seems like James Alefantis and other are a part of it.</p>

<p>You also don&#39;t seem to understand how difficult it can be for victims (alives one) to come forward and talk about this stuff. Also one victim from that will rarely be in a position to know all the party implicated in his trafficking.</p>

<p>More and more are coming foward and are talking about experience they had. They are doing it because they see similarities between what they went through and pizzagate.</p>

<p>But hey, I guess if no one is droppping a body in my hand, better discredit everything and do like everyting is fine... Let&#39;s just wait for them to make a mistake, if it even happens.</p>

<p>You know the problem? When ONE does a mistake.. ONE fall... But the ring stays in place and won&#39;t suffer from it.</p>

<p>People are not investigating all of this because it&#39;s fun to do it... They do it because the more the investigation goes, the more things keep adding up to each other. If it was not the case, it would have ended a long time ago already. The fact that it just keep growing just show that something weird is happening here and proofs need to be found.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There is a legal concept known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corpus_delicti"><em>corpus delicti</em></a>.</p>

<p>A body, per se, is not needed. But <em>some</em> kind of evidence of a crime is. For example: missing person&#39;s blood at his business, a witness, photographs, or, of course, a body. Basically <em>anything</em> that proves an actual crime has been committed. Without a &quot;body&quot; there is nothing to investigate.</p>

<p>Before you bring up missing children, those are their own cases and investigators must follow the evidence in those cases. They cannot just start gathering up all the people in the city with &quot;weird&quot; art, or who were accused by completely anonymous strangers and start &quot;investigating&quot; them. That would be a gross violation of our First, Fourth, and Sixth Amendment rights.</p>

<p>Pizzagate has no victims coming out.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You are referring to a legal concept known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corpus_delicti"><em>corpus delicti</em>,</a> or &quot;body of the crime&quot;. It refers to &quot;the principle that a crime must be proved to have occurred before a person can be convicted of committing that crime.&quot; A &quot;body&quot;, <em>per se</em>, is not necessary. However, there has to be some kind of evidence that a crime actually occurred.</p>

<p>As it stands, PG proponents are advocating for gross violations of our Constitutional Rights:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>First Amendment - They want people to be &quot;investigated&quot; for owning &quot;weird&quot; art</p></li>
<li><p>Fourth Amendment - They want people&#39;s homes/businesses &quot;investigated&quot; and searched without probable cause (i.e. <em>corpus delicti</em>)</p></li>
<li><p>Sixth Amendment - They want people to be &quot;investigated&quot; when accused by completely anonymous strangers who are not under penalty of perjury</p></li>

The scandal started because of FBI releases and the Podesta emails.</p>

<p>Podesta and Clinton are involved. So is Epstein. This has been going on for years. So have the accusations. </p>

<p>Victim? Cathy O&#39;Brien accused the Clintons of involvement years ago.</p>

<p>Hastert has friends in Podesta and Pence. Epstein has friends in Clinton and Trump. Would you mind explaining to me how all of these pedos are unrelated?</p>

<p>If you lump all other elite pedo rings with pizzagate, then you are falling for the trap. Im trying to help you and everybody else that is really concerned with child abuse and trafficking.  Pizzagate is separate from all other rings and incidents until there is a link.  Where are the accusers, the victims? Huh?

<p>But I truly believe he have enough questions to investigate Haiti, and why Monica Peterson died. If I had the money I would hire a translator and try to find families that were affected to get more evidence. Laura silsby is connected to churches with huge sex scandals though. This was a lead I dug myself so it&#39;s not totally complete.</p>

<p>However the people who paid for the hotel was a group called New Life Children&#39;s refuge. There were two churches that supported the trip publicly. I linked it all the way to the minnesota catholic diocese scandal but it needs to be more solid.</p>

<p>But here is a list of all government employee&#39;s who have been convicted of having child porn.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yea or a child who has watched kids be tortured or killed. (like I have) no way I was saying shit. And my family and traffickers seemed pretty normal. That&#39;s how it really is. If people are waiting for a kid to say something or for an adult to admit to something...its just not going to fucking happen. </p>

<p>Thanks. I don&#39;t forget about yall and I&#39;m really thankful people are taking some kind of action when they see that something isn&#39;t right. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, I don&#39;t think there&#39;s too much danger of that because no one other than regular people on reddit are looking into it. There isn&#39;t an official investigation. Maybe when these regular people do find some evidence, there will be. </p>

<p>No one has even been questioned. I think they&#39;ll be fine. </p>
