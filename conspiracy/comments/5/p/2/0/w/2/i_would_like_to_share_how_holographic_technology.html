<p>There were a few theories floating around that this technology may have been used to give the impression that Julian Assange is alive and well in the Ecuadorian embassy.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Absolutely. </p>

<p>If it seems like a conspiracy, it probably is. Our gut instincts <em>tell us</em> something is going on.</p>

<p>Now when groups of people start saying <em>hey, my instincts are telling me something is going on. See what we&#39;re seeing here!?</em> .... you know what I mean! It&#39;s lunacy to think that anyone would try to tell us our feelings are wrong.</p>

<p>Seeing is believing and I believe we&#39;re seeing some shills spreading misinformation/disinformation to further divide us all. Sure we can have naysayers and fact checkers, but a quick glimpse on YouTube about debunked Assange recent news.... well, magic 8 ball instincts telling us outlook not so good. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>And if Julian Assange is just a CIA cartoon... why don&#39;t they make him say that Russians gave him the leaks? Why make a fake Assange that won&#39;t do what you say? </p>

<p>Anyone pushing that JA is a cartoon is obviously trying to establish reasonable doubt for upcoming child sex tapes starring rich and powerful people. </p>

<p>&quot;See! Russians can put kiddy porn starring me on my computer! I&#39;m innocent! It was them damned russian hackers and japanese holograms! Not me! I swear!&quot; </p>

<p>Why make a fake Assange that won&#39;t do what you say?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Because we&#39;re witnessing a stage play. Assange has been controlled opposition all along, whether he&#39;s CGI or not. He&#39;s supposed to counter the Russia narrative; it&#39;s what he&#39;s scripted to do. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>So Assange was always on their side... so they killed him... and replaced him by a cartoon? Seems easier to just leave the real one there so they didn&#39;t have to expose the existence of futuristic livestreaming CGI technologies to a bunch of internet weirdos. </p>

<p>Oh no... first Assange and Putin and now... me?!?! I&#39;m controlled opposition too! How deep does this conspiracy go!?! If you see a video of me fucking a baby remember that it is just my CIA CGI doppelganger! </p>

<p>Seriously though, I don&#39;t think he&#39;s not real, that video  just looks really fake to me. No idea why they would fake it, my guess is they captured or killed him and are using whatever they can to string along anyone that is interested. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>No... cause he did the livestream... and I asked a question and he answered it... so he wasn&#39;t prerendered... and no amount of CGI magic can accurately replicate the disgust of a grown man forced to look at a twitch chat. </p>

<p>He said people that say he are dead are just part of a Black OPs Campaign to discredit Wikileaks to hinder donations and leaks... it&#39;s mind games... and you are either on the bad guys side... or fooled by the bad guys.

<p>Actually the tech we used for the Tupac thing was over a hundred years old! True! It&#39;s called Pepper&#39;s Ghost and it&#39;s a simple light trick. Honest, this is really easy stuff. </p>

<p>The insidious stuff are the tech used in Hollywood movies. We can make anyone say or do anything and make it look...Well, real. We can computer generate any shadow or light or camera anomaly that you think are the &quot;tells&quot; for something to look real.</p>

<p>If anyone is doing things like faking Julian Assange, it&#39;s not a hologram.  It&#39;s just straight up CGI like in star wars or mad max.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Exascale computing refers to computing systems capable of at least one exaFLOPS, or a billion billion calculations per second. Such capacity represents a thousandfold increase over the first petascale computer that came into operation in 2008.[1] (One exaflops is a thousand petaflops or a quintillion, 1018, floating point operations per second.) At a supercomputing conference in 2009, Computerworld projected exascale implementation by 2018.[2]</p>

<p>Exascale computing would be considered as a significant achievement in computer engineering, for it is believed to be the order of processing power of the human brain at neural level (functional might be lower). It is, for instance, the target power of the Human Brain Project.</p>

<p>This is when the real shitshow will start. We&#39;re massively outgunned when it comes to sheer computing power. Your i7 is a joke comparatively. </p>

<p>dodging the question?  Surprised that Assange didn&#39;t call out your little echo-chamber specifically in his last interview, what you&#39;re doing is absolutely obvious.</p>

<p>Thankfully there&#39;s still places online where your kind haven&#39;t infiltrated truth seeking forums so people can actually discuss reality without being silenced by you types.</p>
