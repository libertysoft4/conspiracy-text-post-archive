        <p><span class="badge badge-primary">58</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;2017-01-20 by <a class="author" href="../../../../../../../../user/sagittariuscraig.html">sagittariuscraig</a></p>
        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Dolores Cannon (1931-2014) (<a href="http://www.dolorescannon.com/">http://www.dolorescannon.com/</a>) spent her career as a hypnotherapist specializing in past life regression. Her career spanned almost 50 years and had taken her on an incredible journey along countless fascinating destinations. </p>

<p>In her 600+ page 2011 book, &quot;The Three Waves of Volunteers and the New Earth&quot; (<a href="http://amzn.to/2jVPQia">http://amzn.to/2jVPQia</a>) (which I highly recommend and now own!), Cannon documents how, through her hypnosis work, she has discovered three waves of spiritual &quot;volunteers.&quot; Some,she says, have come direct from the &quot;Source&quot; and have never lived in any type of physical body before. Others have lived as space beings on other planets or other dimensions. Because all memory is erased upon entry to the Earth dimension, they do not remember their assignment (they suffer from &quot;the veil of forgetfulness). Thus these beautiful souls have a difficult time adjusting to our chaotic world. &quot;These souls,&quot; the book says, &quot;have a vital role to play as they help all of the rest of us ascend to the New Earth.&quot;</p>

<p>So where is the proof that this relates to the Mandela Effect (ME)?  Well, let me back up a step and say first that: I am convinced that those of us experiencing this effect are &quot;awakened&quot; and by nature more skeptical and questioning of the status quo.  I&#39;m guessing most of us are aware of the plans for a &quot;New World Order&quot; and oppose it, along with all of the false flag attacks, central bank ponzi schemes, and everything else that goes along with it.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not certain if I&#39;m personally one of the &quot;volunteers&quot; the book refers to, but that&#39;s beside the point.</p>

<p>Many of us experiencing the ME recall being from an earth on the Sagittarius arm of the Milky Way Galaxy, and those of us who are from that arm seem to recognize all of the same ME&#39;s/changes, so there&#39;s definitely something we have in common.</p>

<p>So here&#39;s where it gets crazy.</p>

<p>One of the things I noticed that immediately struck me about this &quot;new earth&quot; is the new wildlife and hybrid animals, as well as the much more diversified types of plants.  One of the most beautiful new trees I became aware of was the &quot;rainbow eucalyptus&quot;: <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=rainbow+tree&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjdv63n-MnRAhUEyGMKHW9cA1kQ_AUICCgB&amp;biw=1517&amp;bih=607#tbm=isch&amp;q=rainbow+eucalyptus">https://www.google.com/search?q=rainbow+tree&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjdv63n-MnRAhUEyGMKHW9cA1kQ_AUICCgB&amp;biw=1517&amp;bih=607#tbm=isch&amp;q=rainbow+eucalyptus</a></p>

<p>You can see my post on new plants/animals/diversity here: <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/Retconned/comments/5nbm59/orion_spur_earth_is_way_more_colorful_and_diverse/">https://np.reddit.com/r/Retconned/comments/5nbm59/orion_spur_earth_is_way_more_colorful_and_diverse/</a></p>

<p>And my post on hybrids here: <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/Retconned/comments/5nbgdl/the_prevalence_of_hybrid_animals_and_intergenus/">https://np.reddit.com/r/Retconned/comments/5nbgdl/the_prevalence_of_hybrid_animals_and_intergenus/</a></p>

<p>Many of you fellow ME experiencers have noticed these new animals, the new human anatomy, and the new geography... not to mention the fact that we are now on the Orion spur (or so they say) in the Milky Way galaxy, over 80,000 light years away from our original home.</p>

<p>So, get this: after becoming aware of the &quot;rainbow trees,&quot; I became very fascinated by all of new things nature had to offer, and got very curious about those things.</p>

<p>A bit later, I became aware of all of the people commenting about how their own friends, family, etc. had been &quot;acting strange,&quot; or not like themselves, and how people who had previously been friendly were acting downright hostile whenever the ME was brought up.  This got me wondering, who are these people exactly, why do some recognize the ME&#39;s while others appear, for lack of a better word, to be &quot;asleep&quot; and either totally unaware anything has changed, or unconcerned even when it&#39;s obvious to them something HAS changed?  And why are all of them so quick to change the subject, or &quot;put off&quot; by our trying to discuss it?</p>

<p>This question led me to the work of Dolores Cannon (see above), and to a video discussing &quot;back-drop&quot; and &quot;back fill&quot; people: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Gc1mGdoHRg">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Gc1mGdoHRg</a></p>

<p>See here for more articles about this: <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=dolores+cannon+people&amp;biw=1517&amp;bih=607&amp;source=lnms&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjB2Z6b-snRAhVI1WMKHSaGDnYQ_AUIBygA&amp;dpr=0.9">https://www.google.com/search?q=dolores+cannon+people&amp;biw=1517&amp;bih=607&amp;source=lnms&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjB2Z6b-snRAhVI1WMKHSaGDnYQ_AUIBygA&amp;dpr=0.9</a></p>

<p>The above supposes that although many of us crossed to the new earth, for various reasons others either didn&#39;t get here yet, or never will, and that many people were simply energy-beings and never &quot;real people&quot; in the first place.  That&#39;s a tough pill to swallow, I&#39;ll be honest. But it may explain why people are acting strange... almost robotic, it seems.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve also been posting theories I&#39;ve found that I&#39;d <em>NEVER</em> heard of before, that seem to explain why some of us are experiencing the ME.</p>

<p>Take my &quot;9 Veils&quot; posting, for example: <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/Retconned/comments/5nbrj6/the_harder_we_try_to_explain_what_we_are_able_to/">https://np.reddit.com/r/Retconned/comments/5nbrj6/the_harder_we_try_to_explain_what_we_are_able_to/</a></p>

<p>I&#39;ve also discovered a  70+ year old &quot;prophecy&quot; that seems to explain - almost to a T - what is going on with us, and what the &quot;Mandela Effect&quot; really is.</p>

<p>See my post here, about the prophecy of Peter Konstantinov Deunov and his 1944 prophecy:  <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/Retconned/comments/5nby6s/explanation_for_the_mandela_effect_peter_deunov/">https://np.reddit.com/r/Retconned/comments/5nby6s/explanation_for_the_mandela_effect_peter_deunov/</a></p>

<p>Now, are you sitting down?</p>

<p>Good.</p>

<p>Because the next thing is going to blow your mind.</p>

<p>I felt drawn to look into Dolores Cannon&#39;s work more, and bought one of her books (see above) on Amazon.  I read it in a single day.</p>

<p>On page 518-522, there is a particular interesting conversation she had with a client from Australia, named &quot;Christine.&quot; You can read it here:
<a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=_UFcBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT466&amp;lpg=PT466&amp;dq=new+earth+orange+trunks&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=FycUzDawRf&amp;sig=zIeIEvo3sq2cDRu6AbG00EYfq5M&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjKkpD288nRAhVGjFQKHQXdDtgQ6AEIIDAB#v=onepage&amp;q=%20trunks&amp;f=false">https://books.google.com/books?id=_UFcBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT466&amp;lpg=PT466&amp;dq=new+earth+orange+trunks&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=FycUzDawRf&amp;sig=zIeIEvo3sq2cDRu6AbG00EYfq5M&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjKkpD288nRAhVGjFQKHQXdDtgQ6AEIIDAB#v=onepage&amp;q=%20trunks&amp;f=false</a></p>

<p>Or you can read pretty much the whole book here:
<a href="https://issuu.com/earthcat/docs/the_three_waves_of_volunteers_and_t">https://issuu.com/earthcat/docs/the_three_waves_of_volunteers_and_t</a></p>

<p>My understanding is the material was printed as far back as 2007, in Cannon&#39;s earlier book, &quot;The Convoluted Universe, Book 2&quot; (<a href="http://amzn.to/2jvWDlK">http://amzn.to/2jvWDlK</a>).  This was WELL before anyone experienced the Mandela Effect, folks - and it all coming true / became true.</p>

<p>Read on...</p>

<p>This is what Australian client Christine told Dolores Cannon under hypnosis:</p>

<p>&quot;You see, the new Earth is not this dimension. The new Earth is another dimension.And we will move into that new dimension. And in that new dimension, there&#39;ll be these trees that have purple and orange intheir trunks. And there will be beautiful rivers and waterfalls. And the energy will be brought back.&quot;</p>

<p>She goes on to say, &quot;I&#39;m seeing us stepping through. (Starled) Oh! What I&#39;m seeing is that the people who are going to the new dimensions will step through into this new world.&quot;</p>

<p>Q: While the other one is being cleaned?</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, we just walk across.&quot;</p>

<p>About changes to our body / anatomy and DNA changes she says will be hoisted upon us during the shift, the client says.</p>

<p>&quot;It&#39;s like a car. Imagine a car that has an old body. It&#39;s just the same old car you&#39;ve been driving. And then you put a new engine in it. And suddenly that car begins to perform differently, even though it LOOKS THE SAME. And then you get another engine, and you replace it. And the car keeps getting faster and faster, and brighter and smarter. And then before you know it, the car is doing such good things, that the body starts to change. It&#39;s like the energy of the new engine starts to reform the body. And before you know it, the chap has turned into a sport&#39;s car. A beautiful, glossy, attractive vehicle. And THAT&#39;S WHAT THIS IS ABOUT. The energies that are coming in have the ability to transform the vehicle. And it will start to be different. It&#39;s going to look smarter and younger. The cells of the body, the vibration of the body is changing, and is matching the vibration of the incoming energy. And the physical changes will be next.&quot;</p>

<p>Q: What will those physical changes be?</p>

<p>&quot;Oh! The body&#39;s going to change to be LIGHTER. And I&#39;m getting that it will look TALLER. It&#39;s not that it&#39;s going to be taller.  But the energy from within is somehow going to become visible on the outside. And it will make the body seem taller, elongated, slimmer. And more transparent.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;The people have all been given that choice [to evolve]. If they want to evolve with the Earth, they will evolve into this NEW HUMAN BEING. It will LOOK DIFFERENT.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;And these things are going to continue to happen until the cleansing is complete. Those who are here to stay [on the new Earth] are taking this race of people into a very new and different civilization. These people are being tested now,to see if they can hold the light when there is disaster, and not be sucked in. They&#39;re the people who will move ahead with this planet.&quot;</p>

<p>Q: Almost like a last test?</p>

<p>&quot;Yes. The TESTING IS GOING ON RIGHT NOW. Whatever each being needs to test them, to see what they&#39;re capable of giving back to this program; how firm their commitment is. How willing they are to serve. That is all being tested now.&quot;</p>

<p>Q: So each one is having their own individual test?</p>

<p>&quot;Yes. And THE PEOPLE WHO ARE FINDING IT TOUGH NOW ARE THE ONES WHO ARE STAYING. They&#39;re the ones who are going through the tests. But some of them are not coming through.&quot;</p>

<p>Q: I was told by other people, that some would be left behind.</p>

<p>&quot;Each soul is given the choice. And if they are not moving and evolving, it&#39;s because they are choosing not to. And they will reincarnate into another place of their choice. And it&#39;s all right. Because it&#39;s only a game.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;They&#39;ll stay in the old Earth (those who do not choose to evolve.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;The new earth is so beautiful. You will see colors and animals and flowers you never imagined possible. You&#39;ll see fruit that is perfect food.&quot;</p>

<p>Q: Are these fruits and vegetables we don&#39;t have on earth now?</p>

<p>&quot;We don&#39;t have them. They&#39;re mutations in some ways. I&#39;m seeing a custard apple as an example of what happened. We will have a fruit called a &#39;custard apple.&#39; And it doesn&#39;t look like an apple. It has a rough exterior, and it&#39;s about the size of two oranges put together. And then you open it. It&#39;s like custard inside.&quot;</p>

<p>At this point I stopped and said, you have GOT to be kidding me.  There&#39;s no such thing as a custard apple.</p>

<p>So I looked it up:
<a href="https://www.google.com/search?site=&amp;tbm=isch&amp;source=hp&amp;biw=1366&amp;bih=547&amp;q=ciustard+apple&amp;oq=ciustard+apple&amp;gs_l=img.3...152.1327.0.1428.14.7.0.5.0.0.116.720.1j6.7.0....0...1ac.1.64.img..2.6.603...0j0i10i24k1.efBSaqDaDqc#tbm=isch&amp;q=custard+apple">https://www.google.com/search?site=&amp;tbm=isch&amp;source=hp&amp;biw=1366&amp;bih=547&amp;q=ciustard+apple&amp;oq=ciustard+apple&amp;gs_l=img.3...152.1327.0.1428.14.7.0.5.0.0.116.720.1j6.7.0....0...1ac.1.64.img..2.6.603...0j0i10i24k1.efBSaqDaDqc#tbm=isch&amp;q=custard+apple</a></p>

<p>Holy. Shitake.</p>

<p>And then it was obvious to me.</p>

<p>Folks, we&#39;re on the new earth. We raised our vibrations, and we were more than the required 51% positive: <a href="http://in5d.com/what-is-this-51-percent-that-everyone-is-talking-about/">http://in5d.com/what-is-this-51-percent-that-everyone-is-talking-about/</a></p>

<p>We did it.</p>

<p>This is why we see the Mandela Effects and the others don&#39;t.</p>

<p>We crossed, and they didn&#39;t. We&#39;re the ones &quot;being tested,&quot; both my this, and it sounds like, disaster up ahead.</p>

<p>Cannon goes on to say that those of us being tested will be a calm in the storm, and we will see through all of the hate, negativity and propaganda. And that not a hair on our heads will be harmed if we believe and remain positive.</p>

<p>To me, the info in this book is 100% confirmation that we crossed.</p>

<p>There were no rainbow trees on Sagittarius arm Earth, and no custard apples.</p>

<p>Everything they said is true.</p>

<p>Now that we know, can we begin working together to form a true community and work to manifest positive change in this new Earth?</p>

<p>Let&#39;s dispel the darkness, and be the candles in the night.  </p>

<p>We can do it.  I know we can.  :)</p>

<p>TD;LR  Everyone is wondering what is causing the Mandela Effect, blaming it on D-wave computers/CERN, or some other gov&#39;t conspiracy, or a Biblical &quot;demonic deception.&quot; But the truth of what is causing this is in the trees - the rainbow trees - which are new to everyone experiencing the ME. And it was documented well before the Mandela Effect was given a name or was recognized, back in 2007, in a book by hynotherapist Dolores Cannon. And the book and it&#39;s client testimony is 100% proof that those experiencing the ME are part of the group of people that made it to the 5D &quot;new earth.&quot; The ascension came like a thief in the night, and is upon us. The anatomy changes, the geography changes, all of the collective shared memories everyone insists is &quot;faulty memories,&quot; it all makes sense now. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Everytime I think my brain has been put together, one of you redditers post something like this! </p>

<p>I love Dolores Cannon, but still had my doubts, as it&#39;s impossible to really trust anything. But everyday I can&#39;t believe what I&#39;m seeing my own eyes? You&#39;re not crazy,  my best guess is everyone I think is being guided at their own pace.</p>

<p>I think you are on to something! 😊</p>

<p>***im just going say this, I&#39;m not psychic or have any hidden knowledge but when I read Cannons books, the whole time I noticed pressure in my 3rd eye region. Just a whole bunch pressure in my forehead. And the books are so nice, so I was in a super good mood.</p>

<p>Anyways, These last couple of weeks, I feel it happening again. By chance, I meditated on a flat earth image inside Metatron&#39;s cube and had an almost spontaneous DMT like trip. While sober 😜</p>

<p>I do think we&#39;re being guided by good forces and what we need to do is expose the evil so that we can wake our brothers and sisters. And hopefully show them that to find true joy and happiness, we simply need to treat others with love.</p>

<p>Because all that love comes right back at us --and everyone will be blissed out - a unified thought might just change the world. </p>

Not the darth vader line, Not mandela, not the scarecrow with a gun. I will say I&#39;m over thirty and I never knew there were these rainbow trees till I went to Hawaii 8 years ago. I think its pretty plausible more people have just naturally never heard of them. As for custard apples.. That is new to me but not at all surprising.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think it&#39;s part gaslighting, part social experiment to study memes that is orchestrated by the minerva institute, part of DOD, with help by google to confabulate artificial search results that prefer the misspellings and alterations that have been put out into the wild through various blogs.</p>

<p>We know a couple of things: 1) google is cia, 2) hillary and obama are cia, 3) they have a vested interest to distract and divide (divide and rule) people, creating controversy as control, 4) they have an extreme willingness and gameplan to discredit conspiracy theorists that we know about (see Cass Sunstein&#39;s anti-conspiracy plan implemented by Obama), 5) Minerva institue exists, 6) MKULTRA is proven, 7) the idea of neuropolitics is over--the establishment feels entitled to your psychology--that&#39;s the whole Sidney Gottleib &quot;psychocivilizing&#39; society and mkultra subprojects and monarch (drug/torture) mind control is about, 7) We see many other egregious intrusions into people&#39;s private spaces--their devices, their homes, their finances, their politics, their civic and lawful participation in groups, etc--we see cointelpro like programs infiltrating them, 8) we see infiltration into the media, and finally 9) we know about QUANTUMINSERT which is an on-the-fly alteration of any webpage contents by a malicious (CIA) third party in order to spread disinformation / confabulate the website visitor</p>

<p>All these are signposts that point to one thing: Gaslighting.</p>

<p>Our extreme and nearly one-stop-shop reliance on google services, through their ad networks, and their free analytics software means they have an entry into nearly all blogs and websites to coordinate any type of gaslighting on those sites</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;ve got much to learn.  This effect is not limited to misspellings and online phenonema.  People are seeing different streets and buildings on routes they have driven on for years popping up overnight; train tracks where there weren&#39;t any, playgrounds on street corners where there used to be houses.  Static electricity is acting up, ice forms differently, there are new animals, types of plants, including RAINBOW TREES, not to mention geography changes confirmed by people on the ground.  </p>

<p>This is not the gov&#39;t doing this.  This is ascension.  Catch up or be left behind, it&#39;s up to you.  I suggest you read Napoleon Hill, Jerry Hicks and Neville Goddard.  Thoughts are things.  </p>

<p>I am pretty much nothing in the hierarchy of our society, but I feel immensely powerful in spirit, and so should anyone with a passion and stake in the world and the well being of fellow men. </p>

<p>True or not, I feel a sense of purpose again, and if it all turnded out to be bullshit, at least I have feel I have a springboard again, to get my own shit together, and maybe be one of those people that helps the world get its shit together as well.</p>
