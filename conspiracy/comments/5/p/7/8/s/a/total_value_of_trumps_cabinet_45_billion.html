    <div class="md"><p>Well no I agree. I mean, that&#39;s the problem. The swamp was made of people who are qualified for the jobs. You can&#39;t drain the swamp. The swamp is made of people who are capable. So, who are those people? Generals, scientists, professors, bundlers, members of congress, governors, etc. That amount of wealth bothers me for other reasons than just how it defy&#39;s the swamp expression, though.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>In his speech he stated he would be giving power back to the people. Does filling your cabinet with billionaires (or the 1%) who have made their fortune exploiting people and the environment count as giving power back to the people?</p>

<p>Hillary Clinton was rightly criticised for being too close to Goldman during the campaign, now Trump has ex-Goldman employees in his cabinet but he seems to have escaped widespread criticism</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hillary was criticized for pay for play, benghazi, and a slew of other (at bare minimum) shady activity as secretary of state.  Her goldman sachs relations are just another little dash of pepper in the disaster recipe that she is.  Trump doesn&#39;t have the same history that she has.  Trump still has a chance to prove that he is terrible or quality.  And for the record, goldman sachs veterans could equally be perfect people for understanding how to level the economic table as they could possibly be the worst people for the job.  At least give them 60-90 days to show us what they got.  Im tired of people saying &quot;yup!  He has people who worked for goldman sachs!  We&#39;re fuked!&quot;  Enough of that already</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Trump may not have the same history, but there is still a lot of distasteful stuff he has done in the past, enough to get a handle on the type of person he is.</p>

<p>In political terms, I don&#39;t think he has handled his ownership of the Trump Organization very well and there are still questions to be answered over links to Russia. But you are right, he should get a chance. I&#39;m just not that hopeful, so far anyway.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Are you willfully ignoring all the conflict of interests a Trump presidency will have with his business ventures?</p>

<p>The man is in position to expand his wealth and influence, not only for himself, but for his family and friends.</p>

<p>The biggest issue people would be complaining about if Hillary one is the Clinton foundation. But because Trump entertains and distracts, the criticism isn&#39;t there from those tired of all the Trump headlines.</p>

<p>It is sad to watch people get duped because of their diminishing attention spans and lack of understanding.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>But you are duped.</p>

<p>You&#39;re willing to swallow that bitter pill so that the man can be given a chance because you&#39;re tired of being exposed to the issues.</p>

<p>You are literally putting your head in the sand. It seems extremely hypocritical given that Democrats did the same for Clinton. They didn&#39;t care about speeches, emails, and cozy bank relationships. They didn&#39;t worry about the CF or Benghazi.</p>

<p>Why? Because they were tired of hearing about it and wanted to give her a shot.</p>

<p>It&#39;s a fucking stupid mentality and both candidates&#39; supporters have it.</p>

<p>Was talking to a friend who knew a guy that worked for GS. He said he was ashamed to tell his family where he worked. After a year he got called in for an interview and asked where he saw himself going in the business. He gave his reply that he thought investment was an important part of raising the living standards for the world etc. The manager said &quot;nope, wrong answer. If you&#39;re not here to make as much money for yourself then you shouldn&#39;t be here.&quot;</p>
