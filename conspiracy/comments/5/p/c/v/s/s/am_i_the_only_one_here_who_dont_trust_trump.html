    <div class="md"><p>Yes. It would actually apply justice to people who broke the law and made thousands homeless. Also it would serve as a warning to future bankers <em>not</em> to pull the same bullshit a second time. It seems to have worked fabulously in Iceland which was pretty much the only country to hold their bankers accountable.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Of course the bankers did not break criminal law, and the businesses were fined a lot of money for being possibly negligent. Oh, and Iceland needed a bailout, financed in part by the US, after its banks went under, so I guess they have their own problems. The whole jailing bankers thing is cute, but it didn&#39;t make the crisis any better for them.</p>

<p>Numerous documents prove that executives at leading banks, credit agencies, and mortgage brokers were falsely touting assets as sound that they knew were junk — the very definition of fraud.  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Some google searching will reveal the specific laws I&#39;m sure but I can&#39;t be bothered to follow up a 7 year old crime. I&#39;m not a financial accountant, nor have I really stayed on top of the banking issues around the melt down either. What I know is that Obama administration had a chance to pursue and prosecute and didn&#39;t. The choice not to go after these bankers was framed under the lie that prosecution would create financial instability. That&#39;s unforgivable.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s super cute you won&#39;t let this go. </p>

<p>Let me educate you on politics. </p>

<p>You are correct, the president can order an investigation. They can also order a stop to the investigation (which is what happened). They can also tell the DOJ to not press charges (which is also what happened). Furthermore the president can introduce laws through House or Senate leaders or make signing statements which directly affect laws... by doing this they can change law in order to make things previously illegal legal (which is what happened under both Bush and Obama). </p>

<p>In the US this is what we call a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republic">Constitutional Republic.</a> </p>

<p>If you run under a Prime Minister then very similar actions can be taken by your elected official. </p>

<p>In Constitutional Republics all citizens are supposed to be considered equal under the law. This is not what happened under Bush or Obama with regards to the financial collapse. Certain citizens were allowed to commit fraud and were not held accountable for it. Furthermore, those citizens who committed fraud were financially rewarded for their behavior with a $800 billion bail out which Bush failed to create guidelines for distribution and Obama failed to rectify. </p>

<p>Going back to Regan, US Presidents have worked to entrench an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oligarchy">Oligarchy</a> in the United States by centralizing powers in the federal government and creating laws the specifically benefit the upper classes of citizenry.  </p>

<p>The person currently acting as US President has made promises to decentralize government power and return much of those powers to the States, as well as attempt to end the pay-to-play aspects of lobbying government. These are steps that would effectively move <em>against</em> the oligarchy and possibly begin returning the US to its proper Constitutional Republic status. Whether or not he does this is what will define him as a fuck up or not.  </p>

<p>You on the other hand,are quite happy seeing the subjugation of the lower class at the hands of upper tiers of government.  </p>

<p>You want a King. I don&#39;t. </p>

<p>Please don&#39;t waste my time anymore with idiotic statements about government because it&#39;s painfully obvious you have no idea what you&#39;re talking about.  Maybe go read a book or something.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>For me, it&#39;s not that I <em>trust</em> Trump, rather I had ZERO trust in Hillary and the team behind her. I knew Hillary would bring bad things to the world and we would see essentially a female version of George Bush/Dick Cheney.</p>

<p>With Trump, his Nationalist, anti-[group] talk is unsettling to say the least, but he also has said several things that I think could bring some much needed change to the establishment such as a re-working of NAFTA, reevaluating the NATO situation, and having closer ties to Russia rather than demonizing them. </p>

<p>At the end of the day I truly believe both candidates would be total disasters, and I believe Trump&#39;s will be no short of a horrendous President. But I at least have some hope that the anti establishment talk will at least stir up discussion about what direction we want to take the world in going forward. Maybe people will see this as a rock bottom of sorts and decide that starting in 2020, we need to really reassess what kind of leader we really want. Let&#39;s rebuild our society from scratch and do it right. </p>

<p>a billionaire, casino operator, Israel Supporter, womanizer..etc is &quot;anti establishment&quot; ..and he picked pro-corporate, pro-war, anti-privacy, pro-torture, anti-minority, anti-internet freedom, elitist rich members for his cabinet</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is exactly why I believe he will be a disaster of a President. He&#39;s easily the most alienating President in history, and his &#39;proposals&#39; for his term are all over the place (like you listed). This is why I don&#39;t trust him one bit.</p>

<p>BUT...</p>

<blockquote>
<p>are pro-trump or at least don&#39;t see through him!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I am definitely not pro-Trump and I see exactly what you see. But that&#39;s why I think he is the President we deserve. </p>

<p>I can&#39;t speak for a lot of other members in this sub, but the way I see it going forward is this: if Hillary won, we would just see a continuation of the status quo in Washington - more Washington politician types, more bureaucracy, a pro-war/anti-Russia rhetoric. But, with Trump winning, we get a giant wildcard. Nobody knows how it will go because just going by his quotes, he&#39;s all over the place. But within that mess is some promise (NAFTA re-do, trade and job growth, etc). </p>

<p>So the way I see it is that if he does a few of those things which I believe are badly needed, then it will be totally worth it. And if he doesn&#39;t succeed and becomes a complete mess of a President, then it gives us a chance to start fresh 4 years from now just based on all the attention it will draw.</p>

<p>Tl;dr: love him or hate him, he is bringing attention and discussion to politics never seen before because of how polarizing he is. This can only be good for our future. </p>

The intervention in Libya was a mistake, you don&#39;t know that it didn&#39;t change the outcome much or that it prevented casualties, and arming syrian &quot;rebels&quot; was a mistake as well. The point is, as Secretary of state shit did fuck all for improving foreign policy from the days of bush and Cheney, and to think she&#39;d be different as president is naive. That&#39;s how you know she&#39;d be a train wreck. You should research these things and you&#39;ll see they&#39;re all very similar to eachother (Iraq, Libya, syria).</p>

<p>Arming Syrian rebels was a mistake, America should have established a no-fly zone and had boots on the ground to pacify Syria before Russia stepped in and started bombing everyone who wasn&#39;t pro-government. </p>

<p>Isis is an entirely different animal. We trained isis/isil forces.

<p>Isis is insatiable and cannot be appeased. They have to be wiped out. There is no future in working with them. Assad isn&#39;t some Kim il sung type dictator, we can work with him. Above all else, if we want to get involved in other country&#39;s bullshit, we need to do it by democratically supporting a democratic change within the country. Not with military force.

    <div class="md"><p>We didn&#39;t arm Libyans and did a terrible job or arming Syrian rebels.</p>

<p>Assad targets Sunni Muslims deliberately, using chemical weapons against civilians. The first push to overthrow him came from pro-democracy protesters during the Arab spring who were tired of the domination of him and his Alawite sect. He caused civil war by violently cracking down on them. </p>

<p>Saying America trained ISIS is disingenuous, because America has trained so many soldiers throughout the past 40 years, it has people who trained with them on every side of the way. It is impossible to know that they would turn out to commit genocide.</p>

<p>ISIS is a symptom of the US failure in the Middle East, it is not a problem in itself, and when it is wiped out, it will be replaced by another group like it. The way to stop that is to stop supporting military dictatorships in the Middle East and stand with pro-democracy groups. Until Syria is liberated and stable, terrorist groups will continue to come. Assad will not stand down. He will drive Syria into the ground, until every Sunni, Kurd and pro-democracy rebel is dead or has left. That is his plan. Obviously, that is not something that can be allowed to happen, it is the definition of genocide. The people want change, but until they receive support like Assad has gotten from Iran and Russia, all they will get is death. </p>

<p>The US should have intervened in Syria before Russia started bombing anyone who didn&#39;t pledge allegiance to Assad. By the time Trump is gone and an actual leader who isn&#39;t in Russia&#39;s pocket is in place, it may be too late.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>We assassinated Gaddafi. Destabilization is my point. </p>

<p><a href="https://www.google.com/amp/www.cbsnews.com/amp/news/did-assad-order-the-sarin-gas-attack/?client=ms-android-att-us">
The case of the sarin gas attack being ordered by assad is backed up by nothing</a>. It&#39;s all hearsay. We don&#39;t know that he did it (in fact, there&#39;s more evidence that our state department provided the gas to rebels and they used it against civilians either intentionally or unintentionally). The Arab spring being a genuine uprising aimed at democratic reshaping is another highly debated and unproven claim. Read &#39;Arabesque&#39; by Ahmed Bensaada. America trained isis/isil when they were in fact known as isis/isil. That is how Obama referred to them when he mentions that we were training them, so for all intents and purposes, we did in fact train isis. If you truly believe trump is in Russia&#39;s pocket, it&#39;s no surprise you believe that assad is a murderous dictator who is orchestrating genocide. All of these things you claim are just recycled from news reports that are very weak in evidence, but it&#39;s taken as fact because it&#39;s reiterated by other &#39;credible&#39; news networks. Before you pass me off as a crazy conspiracy theorist just remember that wmd in Iraq, babies being removed from incubators by saddam, and the aluminum tubes saddam had being used exclusively for weapons zed nuclear purposes, were all perpetuated by the media in the same way as this assad/Arab spring reporting, and they turned out to be demonstrable lies generated to make the bullshit case for war. Just for a few hours of researching, set aside any preconceptions you have about our government/hillary Clinton&#39;s honesty and credibility and read through the information that has actually been verified and is verifiable by you yourself. You may just see why many highly educated people decided that an unknown in the Whitehouse was less risky than President Trump. Give it a chance and see where you end up. </p>

<p>From the <a href="http://www.refworld.org/docid/53182eed4.html">UN Human Rights Commision</a>: </p>

<blockquote>
<p>significant quantities of sarin were used in a well-planned indiscriminate attack targeting civilian-inhabited areas, causing mass casualties. The evidence available concerning the nature, quality and quantity of the agents used on 21 August indicated that the perpetrators likely had access to the chemical weapons stockpile of the Syrian military, as well as the expertise and equipment necessary to manipulate safely large amount of chemical agents.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So yeah, Assad or his allies used Sarin Gas. You should read through the report, it lists other atrocities they committed.</p>

<p>The media has been wrong about some things, certainly, but in this case, what they say is backed by plenty of evidence, from reputable bodies like UNHRC. I actually do do research, unlike you, and instead of linking to a CBS anchor talking about how Assad said he didn&#39;t use chemical weapons, I linked to an investigation which shows he did. I would like to see any real evidence Obama ever funded ISIS, although I don&#39;t think you will find any, considering he didn&#39;t.</p>

<p>I get that you love Trump because he is stupid like you, but this sub is supposed to be about critical thinking, so maybe you should do so.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My man, the US facilitated Gaddafis assassination. The queen loser herself admitted it. &quot;We came, we saw, he died.&quot; I&#39;ve read the report. Nowhere in there does it say assad or his allies used the gas. The &quot;rebels&quot; could very well have been organized enough to use it. After all, they were supported by the best in the business. The article I linked was linked for the actual article, not the video. Nobody can prove assad did it, so by your logic it must not have happened, like you suggest with Obama administration funding isis. And you&#39;re right, I&#39;m so stupid I made my way out of the ghetto and now have my own business with almost two dozen employees and I have a degree in business as well as astrophysics. So yeah I&#39;m basically functionally retarded. Do me a favor and keep calling successful, determined people you speak with stupid. It&#39;s driving more and more people away from engaging in discussions with you and people like you, because it doesn&#39;t persuade people of you argument and instead alienates them, and your words will eventually be useless when nobody cares to hear your voice. Just food for thought. I hope you will do as I do and keep an open mind about all of this stuff because we will inevitable see more information come out and if we are set in our views new evidence does nothing for determining the truth. I appreciate the  (mostly) cordial conversation and wish you the best, my friend. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>He already has a chance. I didn&#39;t give it to him, and I&#39;d take it away if I could, but I can&#39;t, so he&#39;s keeping his chance for the foreseeable future.</p>

<p>That being said, there is absolutely no reason anyone should stop predicting him to do evil things. This is not &quot;theorizing on NO info&quot; - there is tons of info about how Trump operates, what he wants, and what he&#39;s likely to do. Of course, you have to ignore what he <em>says</em> he wants to do, because he lies so blatantly and often that he&#39;s an outlier even among politicians. But 24 hours in, you can already tell he&#39;s one of, if no the most, corrupt presidents in history based on his cabinet picks alone. The only optimism to be found in his presidency is if you agree wholeheartedly with the GOP platform and think Trump will be weak, ineffective, and manipulable enough that the Republicans will get everything they want through him; or you were stupid enough to believe the hilariously flimsy narrative that he was an anti-establishment candidate.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t really care what kind of opinions you want to be insulated from because they&#39;re not &quot;conspiratorial&quot; enough. And if I did, I could mention several things that Trump is involved with that fall directly in line with the theme of this sub. Things that reduce peoplexs trust in him, thereby also directly tying in with the OP&#39;s post.</p>

<p>How about this for example: I don&#39;t trust Trump because I believe he is engaging in a <em>conspiracy</em> with Rex Tillerson and Vladimir Putin to enrich themselves via oil deals in Russia. Is that direct enough for you?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I hear this get thrown around a lot and it confuses me greatly.</p>

<p>Military-industrial complex wanting wars with Middle Eastern nations or other relatively undeveloped nations that can in no way fight back and do any significant strike against American soil? Sure, makes sense, obvious profit there.</p>

<p>War with Russia? I see no way elites of any kind would benefit from this. Even if things didn&#39;t go nuclear (which the risk of is quite high), Russia would be able to do significant damage to the US economy in ways that would definitely hurt even those making money off the military industrial complex. Why the hell would they want to take that massive risk when they have safe massive profits from fighting terrorists who can&#39;t do much of anything to them?</p>

<p>I mean, sure, I can see <em>proxy</em>-war, but that&#39;s never what you people say, you&#39;re always all &quot;full out WWIII direct war with Russia!&quot; which just makes no sense if you think about it for even a minute.</p>

Pizzagate is banned many others quarantined or banned. Conspiracy is one of the few places where you could criticize either side. But a lot of the research and big topics here lately have been against Clinton and the DNC which have the impression that this was an anti Hillary zone.

<p>Coming back to the OP; I&#39;m skeptical of Trump but will wait and see what he brings to the Oval Office from across the pond (Australia).</p>

<p>The rules there are too restrictive for my liking.</p>

<p>What I would like is basically what this sub was prior to the influx of new members within the six months that either bleed across from the_donald, complain about the current US President on the grounds of cultural marxism or post to degrade this sub in general (this sub is as bad as the_donald/politics or some other sub).</p>

<p>What I do not want, nor support, is a sub that restricts users from posting in other parts of Reddit. </p>

<p>A sub, like this one was at one point, that enforces a &#39;Play the ball and not the player&#39; method of moderation; encouraging users to discuss and debate issues where constructional criticism appears without attacking other users (because they post in sub x/y/z, have a bias they openly disclose or appeals to emotion/shaming tactics to undermine others). Take note also of the rule in the conspiracy sub about accusing others of breaking the rules, having that rule (report, do not post &#39;shill&#39; accusations/etc.) would be beneficial.</p>

<p>Any sub that does that would be off to a good start IMHO.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>2- I&#39;m looking for admins </p>

<p>I don&#39;t have any recommendations for admins, nor am I interested in being a mod myself.</p>

<p>What I do suggest is good vetting of mods and checking their post history (ideally more than 12 months worth but Reddit only goes back x posts before archiving the rest) to get a good profile of their beliefs and opinions to ensure they aline with the goals of your sub. Keeping a firm eye on them with strong leadership will aid against infiltration from detractors aiming to derail the sub.</p>

<p>Good on ya for having a crack at it and good luck with your sub.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Most peoples gripe about trump is based off his actions.</p>

<p>Has already broken his emoluments clause by continuing to own his businesses and not putting them in a blind trust which every single president has done before him.</p>

<p>He has not disclosed his tax returns which would tell us if he has investments that would serve as a conflict of interest. Again unlike any president before him.</p>

<p>He has been traced to Russian hacking attempts, has been tied to Russian bankers. Putin has just thrown a party in honor of trump winning and was overheard claiming &quot;America is ours&quot;. Again unlike any other president ever.</p>

<p>Has assembled a cabinet that cannot be defended. You can&#39;t tell me any of the appointments he has made is logical or well thought out. Betsy devos is not even eligible to be a principal and she is in charge of our nation&#39;s children&#39;s education. He talked of draining the swamp and just filled it with his own creatures.</p>

<p>He has not introduced a single plan, he has no plan for after removing the ACA. He has no complete tax plans. No plans to bring back business other than repeal NAFTA, which is unknown how much that will hurt us this far into the agreement. In fact he has ZERO ideas on how to achieve his goals.</p>

<p>He is a goddamn liability. He is not presidential, his mouth has offended world leaders without gaining any advantage. He doesn&#39;t strategize or position himself. He reacts and attacks. </p>

<p>I haven&#39;t heard a single good point about trump with out being able to look back in the past and find proof of the contrary. And sure you can call me a &quot;cuck&quot; or &quot;socialist libtard&quot; but you still will have no facts on your side. </p>

Bill&#39;s infidelity and sexual proclivities, the Clinton Foundation, Benghazi, the DNC rigging things in favor of Clinton and feeding her debate questions ahead of time, Hillary and John Podesta&#39;s email leak, the billion plus dollar in campaign donations from corporations and foreign nations etc. But with Trump, there&#39;s a lot less material to work with. He has virtually no political experience (no conspiracy there) and he&#39;s a billionaire (although he was born rich and probably made ruthless business decisions to get to where he&#39;s at) which makes it unlikely he&#39;d be easily bribed. Hell, the biggest conspiracy related thing about Trump I can think of is &#39;Pissgate&#39;, which doesn&#39;t seem very credible in my opinion.</p>

<p>As Obama stated, I think a lot of people are &quot;cautiously optimistic&quot; about Trump, though personally, I&#39;m not holding my breath.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think this is a place where it&#39;s safe to have meaningful conversations / debates about all of this. Not saying my opinion is right/wrong but you won&#39;t get banned for having a different opinion. Much like T_D is for Republicans/Trump supporters, r politics is a safe place for Dems. </p>

<p>All in all its a mix of both mindsets with a distrust for big brother. His comments today about Iraq gave me pause. And it&#39;s great it&#39;s being discussed here. </p>

<p>I&#39;m hoping he follows through becomes one of the greatest presidents to be elected. I also got caught up in that same message of hope and change in 2008. Parallels yes, but I&#39;m going to give it a chance before my opinion of him is swayed. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The idea that one either trusts or distrusts someone should be abandoned.  It&#39;s too simplistic.  It&#39;s quite common however but it&#39;s far too simplistic of an approach.  It&#39;s not about the person - it&#39;s about the issue.</p>

<p>Judge each issue on it&#39;s own merits then compare to his handling of said issue.  </p>

<p>People are too lazy in their thinking.  They like to break things into dichotomies (it&#39;s either love or hate Trump, it&#39;s either Xbox or Playstation, it&#39;s either VHS or BetaMax).  Stop doing this....we&#39;re better and smarter than this.</p>

<p>You can hate a person but love what they stand for.  You can hate their stance of position A but love and endorse their position on B.  </p>

<p>wrong - you&#39;ll contradict yourself and I&#39;ll point this out.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>1) So what - don&#39;t use other people&#39;s actions or thought processes to justify your own behavior or thought processes.  It all begins with you, not them.  Ignore them, do your thing, appeal to the more evolved approach.</p>

<p>2) I know this is common, I said so in my initial reply but I appeal to the more evolved patterns.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>also, I have red-lines, if someone pass them, I will completely stop trusting the person! such as supporting Israel, supporting torture, picking certain people for the cabinet, owning a casino ..etc ...</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is where you contradict yourself and this has become all too common.  You can say that you only do this in the most extreme cases but you&#39;re missing the point.  </p>

<p>It&#39;s not about trusting the person it&#39;s about the merits of the issue.  </p>

<p>Deal and address the issues and leave the person out of it.</p>

<p>Everyone gets this confused these days.  They say, &quot;Well you support Trump on issue A therefore you support him on issue B&quot;  Which is simply ridiculous.</p>

<p>Or they try to label people with idiotic labels such as Liberal or Conservative.  Which is also equally absurd.  </p>

<p>A person can be liberal on an issue and conservative on other.  I can disagree with a candidate on a number of issues and agree with them on other issues and I don&#39;t have to be extreme with these agreements either.  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>but overall I agree with you!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>haha then you don&#39;t fully agree with me like you initially said you do.</p>

<p>It&#39;s difficult I realize this.  It&#39;s almost as if you want to believe in the ideas I propose but it gets sticky along the way and you revert to your black/white thinking by thinking that redlines are justified.  </p>

<p>Life rarely is black and white and we constantly have to deal with shades of grey but most people don&#39;t want to deal with those because they&#39;re inconvenient.  They&#39;re also easy to misunderstand and one can quickly find themselves at the center of an attack they never intended.</p>

<p>Nevertheless.....the change begins with me and I&#39;ve been greatly benefitted by pushing myself to not adopt simple solutions.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve been getting very sick and tired of the divisions between people.  Too many people go &quot;I disagree with your opinion on this topic, so I will forever hate you and everything you say because fuck you&quot;.  I was over Trump winning pretty quickly, and I just want to see how he does going forward.  I don&#39;t have high hopes for him, but that doesn&#39;t mean I&#39;m going to fight everything he does out of some petty need for revenge like the Republicans did during Obama(the Dems during Bush weren&#39;t all that sparkly nice either).  </p>

<p>I feel the powers behind everything haven&#39;t moved an inch, been deposed, or are even the tiniest bit scared because Trump is dancing to their tune.  I&#39;ll just continue to be skeptical, support the issues I feel strongly about, and fight against the things I feel are meant to enslave is more fully.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t think you know he is a selfish prick. You believe he is because of what you see. There are many things you don&#39;t see. You see what MSM reports.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Yes, Trump was born wealthy. But if you look close enough you will find he works his ass off. He campaigned non-stop making 3 campaign appearances a day up until the election. His opponent went weeks doing 1-2 appearances the entire time. </p>

<p>If you look, you will find his second marriage was destroyed because he worked too much. He was never home and Marla wanted a traditional family life. </p>

<p>Trump didn&#39;t need to work so hard on the campaign trail, his opponent did though because his opponent relies on her position to sell govt. favors. Without the position, the income dries up. Trump has a steady income. </p>

<p>You sound like you dislike the person, not what he has done, or said. You sound like a butt hurt liberal.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Been here for years, bro. Far too long to stop now. I was a conspiracy theorist before it was cool. </p>

<p>My positions lean far left to the progressive side. That doesn&#39;t mean I don&#39;t realize both sides are the same. I gave Obama a chance in 2007-2008. I argued for him back then.  He didn&#39;t get my endorsement after being in office a year, though. </p>

<p>The same goes this time around. Hillary was god awful, I was forced to look into Trump with open eyes. I liked what I saw. He speaks his mind. He pulls no BS when he talks. He is anti establishment and anti corruption. He has worked his ass of to get the election. I&#39;ll give him a chance. </p>

<p>But believe me when I say as soon as shit starts to smell, I&#39;m anti-Trump.</p>

<p>For Obama it was filling his cabinet with those Citibank recommendations, He had a majority in the house and senate and didn&#39;t do anything with it. </p>

<p>While I lean left in ideology, I recognize both sides are the same. I&#39;m gonna give Trump a chance. I gave Obama a chance when all the crazy right wingers said he was gonna take their guns. Obama didn&#39;t take their guns, but he turned out to be a piece of shit. And as soon it was obivious, I was anti-Obama.   </p>

<p>Honestly, it kind of sucks that it seems I am always on the side of defense when politics is in the lime light. I defended Obama when he was running for office. Then I found myself arguing the other side with Obama apologists in r/politcs. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>In terms of his cabinet choices, I posted this earlier:</p>

<p>I think it has it&#39;s weaknesses and strengths, but overall is a solid cabinet.</p>

<p>It&#39;s not handpicked by Goldman Sachs was for Obama, but it has it&#39;s weaknesses.
<a href="http://infographics.economist.com/2017/Trump/TrumpGraphic.html">http://infographics.economist.com/2017/Trump/TrumpGraphic.html</a></p>

<p>I think Trump is a bright guy, and chose his cabinet because they can do the job. We&#39;ll see about that. </p>

<p>I have a serious problem with Trump&#39;s position on global warming. His position could possibly be because Trump doesn&#39;t believe the science (I don&#39;t believe this), or he just wants to trash the environment in exchange for short term profits. I&#39;ll be keeping an eye on this. Trashing the environment for now without concern for future generations isn&#39;t cool.  </p>

<p>I also have a serious problem with Trump&#39;s position on Israel. Israel is the fucking anti-christ as far as I&#39;m concerned, and Trump seems to embrace Israel. I don&#39;t know if it is just his online cheer leading crew, or if he is as pro-Israel as they make it out to be, but this is a serious problem. </p>

<p>There are other things I don&#39;t like about Trump, but these are serious issues to me. So far he has hit the ground running. He hit the ground running before taking office.</p>

<p>I disagree with your assessment of his cabinet and your opinion of him, but I do agree with your opinion on global warming.  So we have things we agree on and things we disagree on.  I&#39;m going to treat you like I treat most people; I don&#39;t hate you or dislike you, I just disagree with some of your conclusions.

    <div class="md"><p>Nice comma. </p>

<p>Trump has dedicated himself to repealing all of Obama&#39;s executive actions, repealing the ACA, cutting taxes, building a wall with Mexico, lowering personal and corporate taxes and raising new trade barriers. It is like a platform from the early 20th century. You know what? Life during the early 20th century sucked for everyone, compared to modern life. So how about instead of going back to that shit, we go forward with a 21st century government, that believes in things like science, human rights for all citizens, and facts. </p>

<p>The current &quot;riots&quot; are nothing compared to what happened when America was <del>racist</del> &quot;great&quot;, although I am sure Trump will be able to turn the clock back on that. It turns out when you treat a third of the country like dirt, make it impossible for them to afford healthcare, education, housing or food, they get pissed. They are a symptom of systematic oppression, which Trump&#39;s election will push to new levels.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If Trump is a NWO globalist/puppet, it means his whole campaign, including media bashing, was a remarkably planned and executed psychological operation against the American public. If true, <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/5nqik3/we_are_witnessing_the_birth_of_seconddegree/">this takes the conspiracy to a whole new level</a>. Many cannot bear this.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s a contention: the longer since having awoken, the more likely you are to be skeptical of Trump. Recent awakees are more ardent Trump supporters. Many even have awoken because of the Trump campaign (see # of subscribers of this sub). If anything that will have been a great thing.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I trust based on actions. So far he has said a lot of great things. Things that have awoken the anger in the average person, and motivated them. He had savaged the mainstream media, publicly, and repeatedly. He has personally worked 20 hour days making tons of phone calls and meetings with companies to bring them back to America or stop them from leaving, and has had immense success so far, even before he was inaugurated. He had gotten other companies to invest billions of dollars into building factories here in the US. He spoke out about Suadi Arabia being heavily involved in 9/11. He has called for auditing the federal reserve. It goes on and on.</p>

<p>Likewise, he has said and promoted things I find abhorrent, like increased surveillance, torture, and further erosion of privacy.</p>

<p>I am overall very pleased with his overall message and attempts, but I will be watching closely, and if he goes sideways, I will spend the next 4 years doing anything I can to help get him out of office.</p>

<p>If you doubt that, ask yourself why the general reaction to Trump saying he wants detente with Russia has been hysteria about the &quot;threat to the World Order&quot; and similar Totalitarian newspeak. Even up to the point of talking about a military response against &quot;Russian cyberattack&quot; and/or a CIA backed removal of the now-inaugurated President.</p>

<p>And that&#39;s what one of the, if not THE, keystones of Neocon ideology is: US/NATO global hegemony, the &quot;uni-polar world order&quot;. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m afraid such justifications are increasingly akin to wishful thinking. Trump hasn&#39;t killed anyone yet, so let&#39;s wait and see. The key is what he&#39;ll do when the economic/monetary calamity arrives. If he defaults on the odious US public debt, confiscates foreign gold at the NY Fed (as a fee for services rendered), dissolves the Federal Reserve System, institutes a gold-backed dollar 2.0 (with a preferential exchange rate for Americans and fuck the Chinese), he&#39;s a real nationalist/populist. This would plunge the world into a short-lived depression, but America would be thus leading the 21st century, and the NWO would be gone.</p>

<p>If he signs the US into a new, improved, benevolent, multipolar (global) money system (Bretton Woods 2.0), he&#39;s a sell out globalist. If so, question remains how many will believe him when he&#39;ll say &quot;i negotiated a great deal&quot;.</p>

<p>If 911 2.0 strikes first, I fear he&#39;ll take us to the <a href="http://www.threeworldwars.com/albert-pike2.htm">envisioned</a> clash of civilisations with Islam.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Bear in mind that the spillover from r/The_Dumbass and 4chan mostly doesn&#39;t believe the conspiracy theories they push, be they pizzagate, Hillary being a devil worshipper or Obama being a secret atheist Kenyan Muslim.</p>

<p>Their job is to spread disinformation and lies to help their candidate, Trump. Look at the number of stupid Americans who believe Hillary is a &quot;globalist elite&quot; but Trump, a literal billionaire who&#39;s made his fortune off globalism, is going to fix things. You couldn&#39;t make this shit up.</p>

<p>The people who took over this sub only care about winning at all costs, even if it means flat out lying. A good example is a top post on r/The_Dumbass, which was a poorly Photoshopped photo of Trump&#39;s inauguration crowd made to look much bigger than it actually was. Do you think most of the people upvoting actually think it&#39;s a real photo? No, but their objective is to fight facts with lies and muddy the water - aka disinformation, Soviet style.</p>

<p>I keep posting this as much as I can, and its been pretty ignored so far. But the implications of involvement with Epstein, is involvement with the Clintons, is involvement with the CIA, is involvement with the string pullers of the deep state. He pulled his punches on Clinton in the election cycle, because they had easy dirt on him. If he doesn&#39;t cooperate, they already have enough dirt to force his hand.</p>

Sanders fell all over Pope Francis like a fan boy, and him being Jewish has to make me wonder if he would be able to deal with Israel without having a conflict of interest. I have a FB account (I know, I know). It&#39;s amazing how so many people are viciously defending Trump against links that anger them. Nobody is arguing with their support for Trump with comments.

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t trust him at all.  But what happens is the left keeps attacking him with such weak bullshit that you end up defending him a bunch and sounding like a supporter.  It&#39;s a really tough line to walk because you&#39;re constantly having to preface every sentence with &quot;I&#39;m not a Trump supporter, but...&quot;.   </p>

<p>Especially with the Russia stuff.  How the fuck did the media get people on the left, that all claimed to oppose the Iraq war, to want war with fucking Russia and criticize the desire to have a good relationship with them?  So then, if you don&#39;t want WW3 you&#39;re somehow a Trump supporter.  It&#39;s really the weirdest fucking thing.</p>

I&#39;m saddened that most of the people here keep pushing him down our throats, calling people out as shills, etc. I&#39;ve read everything Pizzagate and think Soros is shady, Hillary is not innocent, Obama has skeletons in the closet, AND that Trump will not be draining the swamp. This whole anti-establishment / he tried to infiltrate the top circles to destroy it from within / he will make America great again sounds a lot like a Batman plot to me. I&#39;d rather check how his bank account has continued to grow despite filing bankruptcy, how his cabinet members are high ranking private company executives, how he would act in office, and how he would act around foreign dignitaries. Just a note though, it&#39;s not binary - not because I question Trump means I do not question Hillary or won&#39;t question her if she has been President. That&#39;s the point of being on a conspiracy sub. It&#39;s the ability to question, to dig, to investigate, and to validate certain things people claim. It is not to keep reminding me daily than he is the lesser of two evils. </p>

<li>Pizzagate and anti-Clinton</li>
<li>anti-vaxxers</li>
<li>survivalists and anti-gun-control</li>

<li>holocaust denial</li>
<li>climate change denial</li>
<li>skeptics/debunkers</li>
<li>more I can&#39;t think of</li>

<p>and there&#39;s a huge amount of overlap of course.</p>

<p>More, many of these areas overlap with &quot;right-wing US politics&quot; - and the leftists here seen less hung-up about Trump, because they don&#39;t see the huge difference between him and HRC.</p>

I don&#39;t trust Trump, that would be foolish, but I don&#39;t trust &#39;the powers that be&#39; that were fighting tooth and nail the entire campaign to stop him from getting to power. The media, his own damn party, the left, part of the intelligence community, foreign countries media and leaders were all against him and his message. The votes forced them to accept the results.

    <div class="md"><p>I think this is a place where it&#39;s safe to have meaningful conversations / debates about all of this. Not saying my opinion is right/wrong but you won&#39;t get banned for having a different opinion. Much like T_D is for Republicans/Trump supporters, r politics is a safe place for Dems. </p>

<p>All in all its a mix of both mindsets with a distrust for big brother. His comments today about Iraq gave me pause. And it&#39;s great it&#39;s being discussed here. </p>

<p>I&#39;m hoping he follows through becomes one of the greatest presidents to be elected. I also got caught up in that same message of hope and change in 2008. Parallels yes, but I&#39;m going to give it a chance before my opinion of him is swayed. </p>

<p>Not relevant to hades but thought posting here you&#39;d see it. Take care.</p>

<p>From the <a href="http://www.refworld.org/docid/53182eed4.html">UN Human Rights Commision</a>: </p>

<blockquote>
<p>significant quantities of sarin were used in a well-planned indiscriminate attack targeting civilian-inhabited areas, causing mass casualties. The evidence available concerning the nature, quality and quantity of the agents used on 21 August indicated that the perpetrators likely had access to the chemical weapons stockpile of the Syrian military, as well as the expertise and equipment necessary to manipulate safely large amount of chemical agents.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So yeah, Assad or his allies used Sarin Gas. You should read through the report, it lists other atrocities they committed.</p>

<p>The media has been wrong about some things, certainly, but in this case, what they say is backed by plenty of evidence, from reputable bodies like UNHRC. I actually do do research, unlike you, and instead of linking to a CBS anchor talking about how Assad said he didn&#39;t use chemical weapons, I linked to an investigation which shows he did. I would like to see any real evidence Obama ever funded ISIS, although I don&#39;t think you will find any, considering he didn&#39;t.</p>

<p>I get that you love Trump because he is stupid like you, but this sub is supposed to be about critical thinking, so maybe you should do so.</p>

<p>The rules there are too restrictive for my liking.</p>

<p>What I would like is basically what this sub was prior to the influx of new members within the six months that either bleed across from the_donald, complain about the current US President on the grounds of cultural marxism or post to degrade this sub in general (this sub is as bad as the_donald/politics or some other sub).</p>

<p>What I do not want, nor support, is a sub that restricts users from posting in other parts of Reddit. </p>

<p>A sub, like this one was at one point, that enforces a &#39;Play the ball and not the player&#39; method of moderation; encouraging users to discuss and debate issues where constructional criticism appears without attacking other users (because they post in sub x/y/z, have a bias they openly disclose or appeals to emotion/shaming tactics to undermine others). Take note also of the rule in the conspiracy sub about accusing others of breaking the rules, having that rule (report, do not post &#39;shill&#39; accusations/etc.) would be beneficial.</p>

<p>Any sub that does that would be off to a good start IMHO.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>2- I&#39;m looking for admins </p>
</blockquote>

<p>I don&#39;t have any recommendations for admins, nor am I interested in being a mod myself.</p>

<p>What I do suggest is good vetting of mods and checking their post history (ideally more than 12 months worth but Reddit only goes back x posts before archiving the rest) to get a good profile of their beliefs and opinions to ensure they aline with the goals of your sub. Keeping a firm eye on them with strong leadership will aid against infiltration from detractors aiming to derail the sub.</p>

<p>Good on ya for having a crack at it and good luck with your sub.</p>
