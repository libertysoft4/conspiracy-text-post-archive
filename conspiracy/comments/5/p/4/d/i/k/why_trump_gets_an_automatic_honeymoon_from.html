        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Many posts these days object to the apparent pro-Trump take-over of r/conspiracy, on the reasonable grounds that conspiracy theory, almost by definition, distrusts the establishment, and therefore almost all politicians. </p>

<p>I&#39;d love to see this thread include brief bullet points from serious r/conspiracy redditors explaining the &quot;honeymoon effect&quot;, with lively discussion and rebuttals in sub-posts. I&#39;ll start with my three favorites:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>It&#39;s only a honeymoon. We will go skeptical very fast and very hard if the next several months prove that Trump is just as bad as the rest</p></li>
<li><p>It&#39;s not who he is, it&#39;s who he isn&#39;t. Trump isn&#39;t affiliated with either the Obama/Clinton faction, or the Bush faction, which have held sway for over 20 years of conspiratorial calamity from both sides of US &quot;normal politics&quot;</p></li>
<li><p>Trump has made statements and announced policies that would indicate he is doubtful about the wisdom of America&#39;s program of military &quot;adventures&quot; overseas, which were justified by the &quot;biggie&quot; 9/**</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Have at it.</p>

<p>I think you meant &quot;hollowing&quot;, as in &quot;to make hollow/empty out&quot; - not &quot;hallowing&quot; as in &quot;to hallow and make holy/greater than&quot;.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ron Paul didnt win the nomination because  what he said scared the shit out of the establishment so they completely ignored him. Im sure Trump saw this and knew he would get no coverage, and therefore no nomination so he went &quot;all mexican are rapists++++&quot; and they all elevated him so HRC could crush him and it totally backfired.
Listen, i totally get your point, and it does bother me with his cabinet picks. I dont watch fox news or any of the us msm because they all suck. Ill give him a year before i make up my mind, completely. As for now its nice to have a tiny bit of hope, but hope is a fragile thing. TTT.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I believe that Trump will show us that he is not on our side very soon. The only question is when? How long do we have to sit back until we boil over and decide that our time is now? That the American government is corrupt and doesn&#39;t have The People&#39;s interests at hand? How long do we wait to sit back and watch Trump make his decisions before we decide to take matters into our own hands? </p>

<p>Might sound a little crazy, but I am pissed off. We should all be pissed off. Trump talked about strengthening our military, but for what reason? Pull out our troops from all over the damn globe and bring on a basic homeland protection service. A stronger military in the US would be suspicious. Why would we need that? </p>

<p>Trump had never been the establishment or a politician.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Of course it&#39;s only a honeymoon, but the more people push the idea of let&#39;s saying current Obama bombings are a result of Trump,outright deny any fair discussion, and utterly contradict themselves just to proceed with their bias, the more polarized it will be. I hope the rhetoric does stop so there is a chance to be critical, rather than face fascist, nihilistic potentially paid commenters a that will proceed with ideology at all cost.</p></li>
<li><p>Nixon was a Bush and in the WH under Ike. The Bush Clinton machine goes back much further than 20 years and have produced some of the most in your face and wide-spread debasements of the country imaginable. It&#39;s funny how one of Hillary&#39;s bodyguards so casually mentions the Clintons meeting Bush in Mena. Their history is grotesque.</p></li>
<li><p>Trump&#39;s general stance on both ISIS and Syria as well as his previous positions on Libya make him seem like a guy who gets it. I am concerned with his pro-military/police stance because I don&#39;t yet know what it means. I am not against soldiers, I am against MIC spending and how he proceeds there will be an important factor in how I assess his presidency. I asked at his AMA how he would reduce the prison population, and I also submitted a similar question to the presidential debate question site. I don&#39;t want to see the further militarization of our police nor a continuation of the war on drugs. </p></li>
</ul>

<p>A few other points is the vast number of people Trump met with in choosing his cabinet. The media is telling us his picks sucked . I guess they only like picks that waste $14 trillion on war. According to Tulsi Gabbard, a democrat who shares my views on Syria, their meeting was frank and positive. She supports his picks, and the media went after her for it.</p>

<p>We will soon be able to judge for ourselves.</p>
