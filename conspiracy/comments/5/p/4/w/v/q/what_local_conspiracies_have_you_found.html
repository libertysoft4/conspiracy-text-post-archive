        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Little bit of a change of pace. I know this sub likes to focus on the &quot;big picture&quot; but I&#39;m wondering if anyone has stumbled onto smaller conspiracies within their community. </p>

<p>To give an example, the town that borders where I grew up has a mayor that owns two liquor stores. Other than bars no other store can sell liquor (there&#39;s a Walmart that doesn&#39;t when most do). It&#39;s pretty much an open secret the mayor does this so he can make money from his liquor stores.</p>

<p>So, I ask, what small time conspiracy/corruption have you found where you are from? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The big picture is the little picture. They all start somewhere. Some guy happens to kiss his neighbor&#39;s ass a little bit--goes to his head, he becomes Controller or Treasurer of his little bullshit county of 30k residents. Gets a country club membership, pays off the wife&#39;s Toyota SUV--gets a side bitch. The cash starts rolling in the back door, so he then runs for a seat at the state capitol.. and on and on it goes.</p>

<p>To play the big boy game, though, requires a special breed of corrupt. Most of them learn on the way up while they make friends/enemies at the same time. If enough backs are scratched, enough money is made, the sky is then the limit..and that&#39;s why we get this bullshit coin phrase &quot;rising star&quot;. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve often gotten lost in thought imagining mandatory conscription into politics. Members of the highest levels of academia, medicine, finance, etc, all of whom have little interest in politics, being forced into government positions because they would be the best fit, not because they want the position. Terms would end when the representative brought forth some forms of positive contribution to society, however small. I don&#39;t know why, but I find this thought absolutely hilarious.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It is precisely how it <em>should</em> be. It makes the most sense. Career politics should not exist in any form. A old-boy lawyer should not be deciding whether NASA is allocated money for legit science. An investment banker should not be dictating foreign policy.

    <div class="md"><p>I live in Northern Virginia and it&#39;s widely known or suspected that the cops out here are drug traffikers. Now I&#39;ve smoked some weed in my day and met some interesting dealers. But apparently a guy got busted in NJ his product and cell numbers were all 703 based. NORTHERN VA. When the cops looked deeper the case was suddenly frozen and closed. So  fast forward a couple years to 2016 and 40 random drug busts happen in my little suburban town. Raids not for meth or coke but for weed. So we all asked how and why. The police stated they received leads on numbers. Come to find out the NJ dealer has family in VA who lives in Nova and whose brother happens to be a Fairfax County Police officer. I could go into more detail but it&#39;s very weird.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So on Dec 22 a close friend was murdered inside his house. His name was Henok Yohannes. That being said if you Google him you will see the case and how disturbing it is. OKAY so with that news and the drugs new running rampant in my County the police have issued statements saying it was drug related. BUT nothing new to report. A Young Ethiopian girl around the same age was murdered and nobody knows how or why. I think she saw something. THE COPS AREN&#39;T EVEN LOOKING FOR ANYONE AS THERE HASN&#39;T EVEN BEEN A PROFILE MADE OF THE MURDERER YET. Keep in mind I live in Fairfax county. MAYBE 1 murder every 5 years here. I think the cops no more about it then they want to release or they did it. SERIOUSLY. The girl was left dead posted up on a tree. No one knows how she got there.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I live beside a motel that was hurt by a new highway which bypassed it. Over the years business got slower and slower until they only rented it out to the management staff. This year it was closed and no one lived there, it had the power cut, and the mail box was full of unopened letters.</p>

<p>The place burned down. It was a windy day and the only thing that separated our house from the massive inferno was 200 feet of forest. Thankfully, the fire department performed admirably and contained it.</p>

<p>Months later it is ruled suspicious but no suspects are identified. As far as I know the owners had solid alibis and no one could be placed at the scene of the crime. </p>

<p>I know insurance fraud is not much of a conspiracy but it would have taken a group effort to pull this off. Most likely the owners hired someone to do this, but many things could have happened. One thing I do know though, is a building disconnected from electricity on a day with no lightning is unlikely to catch fire by itself.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>In 1986, a high school boy in my hometown was &quot;accidentally&quot; shot in his home.  The official story never made sense -- for one thing, there were <em>two</em> shotgun blasts.  But it was ruled accidental, and that was that.  Until 24 years later, when I&#39;m watching CNN and there has been a mass shooting in Alabama:  three dead, three wounded, and the shooter was the boy&#39;s sister.
Turns out, 24 years before, the boy&#39;s mother --a local politician and supporter of the police chief--got the chief to cover up the murder.  Even though the sister used the loaded shotgun to try to carjack a car after she shot her brother.</p>
