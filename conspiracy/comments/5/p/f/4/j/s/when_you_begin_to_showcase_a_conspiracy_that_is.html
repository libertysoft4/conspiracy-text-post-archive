<p>This is called adult discussion, sharing ideas, even if we do not see eye to eye. </p>

<p>When did we get away from the idea of agree to disagree, it is okay to talk and discuss, but pay attention to how anger fuels some and they actively oppose your voice. Like you&#39;re wrong for feeling what you feel.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m sorry, but that last sentence seems to be rather ironic.  Yes, there are people paid to post, yes, this shit can make people angry, but it really sounds here like you need a break from Reddit. </p>

<p>I keep seeing posts like this calling for witch hunts.  Then there are the posts saying that this is now the donald.  Then there are the other concern trolls saying they are leaving, and pizza gate shit is so thick it&#39;s unbelievable. </p>

<blockquote>

    <div class="md"><p>Are the tags we make personal to us? I&#39;ve never used the suite but if they are (which I&#39;d prefer) then I can make private  notes that I&#39;d find useful. I&#39;ve researched some of the CTR types - the doomy downers and the cconcern trolls - and their post histories are so obviously paid/formulated that it&#39;s almost funny that they get away with it.  </p>

<p>One person makes 10-13 comments a day, every day. Almost the exact same length, same forums, same negative self-superior style.  Started a few months ago. Reddit account is 6 years old. There&#39;s less than ten original posts, all older than the comments, some decent karma numbers, hundreds of comments, and so it looks like a takeover account. </p>

<p>Anyhow, once I know this is the commenter&#39;s background I ignore them. As primarily a lurker watching the discussions I don&#39;t have the time to engage in, this helps me figure out who to listen to and who to not even read. I just hide their stuff and it doesn&#39;t clutter up my field. </p>

<p>So yeah, private tagging would be great. Even if we didn&#39;t share the tags, eventually those people would get no traction, no engagement, and many would leave. </p>

<p>Thanks for posting the app.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think this holds a lot of validity. This is the first time ive been to this subreddit, within less than an hour im disappointed. There&#39;s so much extrapolated vague ideas and informTion, with little discussion. Theres few repeating concepts that are planted, and it goes against my faith of what i used to see the reddit community as. Most things here only propogate fear and violence, with minimal information or ideas. </p>

<p>I admire those of you who are dedicated truth hunters, its just a shame that a passerby like me feels like I have to shift through a mass amount of bullshit, to find even a somewhat coherent thought. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is a nice sentiment.</p>

<p>I should use reddit tags a little more than I do. I sort of rely on how many points &quot;in the green&quot; they have in RES. Most of the regular contributors here have a pretty heavy score in the green. Trolls will start accumulating a negative score over time, but I have started to tag accounts who are clear CTR shills. It gets tricky when someone may be using a lot of sockpuppets and brand new accounts.</p>

<p>There are also people who will show up specifically for GMO posts and Fluoride posts, I started to tag them, but tagging seems  to lose a little of it&#39;s value when the shill <em>only</em> appears on their specific topic.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think one should always reply politely and logically - shills are trying to make their side look like it&#39;s the dominating opinion, and that means making sure they they always get the last word in. They want us to either engage and fight them in their level or ignore/block them so their snarky comment goes uncontested. The one way we can win is by engaging in a rational, polite debate. They are trained to use manipulative techniques to win (or more accurately, <em>appear</em> to win) arguments, and the only thing that puts us at an advantage is the truth - we need to use that. </p>
