        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>The whole inauguration is so unnecessarily ritualistic.  Why the Bible verses?  Why the Classical operas from like the 16th century?  Why the antiquated &quot;patriotic&quot; songs/Pledge of Allegiance in the first place (a whole &#39;nother topic in and of itself)?  How is any of that shit relevant to today&#39;s society?  I get that there is a &quot;tradition,&quot; and I&#39;m not saying get Migos or Drake up there to do rap songs- but how about modernizing the process a little bit so it&#39;s less like some cult initiation (if it truly is on the up-and-up, as they like to pretend).  I mean, come on.  The whole worshipping/chanting/sitting and standing/blah blah blah is so dated and no one seems to question why they have to do all this weird shit.  They wrap it up at <em>exactly</em> noon, and as soon as the new guy gets up there of course it starts raining, as if it&#39;s a signal that their bizarre ritual has worked.  Now of course we get these Satanic lottery numbers.  </p>

<p>Just wondering if anyone besides me notices this shit.  I know a lot of people in here are open to the discussion about the people in power being involved in the occult/Lucifacian/Satan worshiping, and I was hoping to get some other input from the community.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I gave this answer to a different thread but I think it applies here to:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Recognition of the enemy is the first step.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There is an alternate version of the Book of Genesis which was banned by the church, in the Nag Hammadi scrolls called &quot;On The Origin Of The World&quot;.</p>

<p>It starts by saying: I know the stories you have been told. I am telling you they are incorrect. Here is the true story.</p>

<p>In this version, God is a blind and jealous god. He thinks he is the only god, but he is wrong; there are many greater gods before him. He creates the immortal Adam and Eve, and then recognizes that they have the ability to become gods themselves. This makes him afraid and jealous, so he bans them from eating from the Tree of Knowledge, and tells them they will die if they do.</p>

<p>There is no Satan in this story; there is a different character, the Beast. The Beast is the wisest of all creatures. He teaches Adam and Eve many things. He tells Adam and Eve the truth; God is jealous. If you eat from the tree, it will not kill you; you will become as wise and powerful as the gods.</p>

<p>So they eat; God becomes afraid and jealous. In his jealousy he casts them out of Paradise and curses them with mortality.</p>

<p>If you read some of these banned books, my understanding is that your soul is banned to hell; however exceptions may be made for scholars.
In this sub, at least some of us are scholars. As scholars, everything is on the table; no idea, thought or knowledge is forbidden.</p>

<p>In the Bibles, there is story after story about how God strikes down men in anger; wipes out entire cities, or floods the entire planet destroying 99% of living men and creatures.</p>

<p>It is our job to ask: how many wars are fought, how many people are killed in the name of God or Allah; how many wars are fought, how many people are killed in the name of Satan?</p>

<p>Me? I believe these bibles are a way for mankind to pass down knowledge and morality like any other myth; they become combined, translated, and sometimes twisted along the way as men change the stories to suit their needs. Then they are translated, and translated again. The stories are often held up as an example of the Truth, and used by those who would have you believe they are Righteous, in order to have the weak minded do their bidding. There are no words of god here; only the words of men.</p>

<p>The only evil that exists on earth is the evil in the hearts of men. There is no heaven; there is no hell. There is only here and now. All of us have only one life, one chance: do with it what you will. Make it count.</p>

<p>Onwards</p>

<hr/>

<p>There is no Us and Them. There is only Us. The Enemy is Us, the Elite is US; the Illuminati is Us; the middle class is us, the disabled, poverty stricken and mentally ill are all us. There is a continuous cycle, a power struggle, between us. It never ends. </p>

<p>Some of us believe in the occult, in Lucifer, in Satan, in God but these things exist only in the minds of men. If there are solutions to the problems we face, it is up to us to find them and implement them. </p>

<p>I think I&#39;ve rambled on long enough. </p>
