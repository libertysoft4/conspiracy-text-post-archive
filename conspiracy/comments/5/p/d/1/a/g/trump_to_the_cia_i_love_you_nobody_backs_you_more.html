<p>The world is fucked. and we KNEW!! that this would happen with Trump as we <em>KNEW</em> that we didnt want clintons... but holy shit... this is the worst way to handle this.</p>

<p>His speech to the CIA was just made fun of by the media &quot;the most dishonest people in the world&quot; -- where they said &quot;this was a campaign rally speech, not something that we would expect to hear from a president&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Can you 1. Calm down, and 2. Maybe edit your whole post until it can be understood by a normal person.</p>

<p>Sure, Trump should&#39;ve been more respectful at the HQ. That&#39;s why they&#39;re bashing him. If it was at a different location, with the same CIA people, Trump&#39;s comments would&#39;ve been appropriate.</p>

<p>But the media <em>are</em> the most dishonest people in the world. And Trump fucking made them show their own viewers Trumps speech. He called them out on their shit. Each day approval ratings drop. And that&#39;s awesome.</p>

<p>The movie you&#39;re watching is a mass global awakening. Whether Trump is a good guy or a bad guy, both good and evil contribute to this mass awakening. </p>

<p>The world is fucked. We need to fix it. Trump will not be that fix.</p>

<p>and yes - the CIA is a hornets nest. but the CIA is NOT stupid - but it <strong><em>IS</em></strong> stupid to walk in and make a random speech off the cuff - especially after he criticized the CIA (You know - the guys who secretly rendition, torture, kill and overthrow any enemy/anti-interest of the USA as a <em>matter of course</em>).</p>

<p>The CIA fucking knows what they are doing.</p>

<p>But there was no fucking way in hell I would want the Clinton/Bush Cabal to remain in power - if we already know we are fucked - then I would prefer DT to fuck our shit up via his methods, than for HRC to actually profit (and her cabal to profit) from this position.</p>

<p>Lets just hope that DT is ACTUALLY not in the inner circle and is just a lucky useful idiot and we have some breathing room to go after the Clinton/Bush Cabal and fuck them up.</p>

<p>I am 100% anti-hillary. You don&#39;t know who I am, but let me assure you, internet friend, Hillary is the most evil corrupt POS from the entire clinton/bush cabal -- I can go into detail if desired, but she is satan incarnate.</p>

<p>I knew that BOTH HRC and DT were == demise... but I in-no-way wanted HRC+ to profit from the demise of the US.</p>

<p>I would rather Trump fuck it up, or MAYBE he can actually do something. But therewas literally NEGATIVE faith in HRC doing ANYTHING to benefit <strong><em>ANYONE</em></strong> other than herself and those who pay to play.</p>

<p>Jesus. I am not pro-TD, but I am 1000% ant HRC.</p>

<p>Bernie was the only viable option, and <em>even he</em>!! was still pro-israel.</p>

Just because someone posts a wtf trump message doesn&#39;t mean they are for Clinton or the previous president, they are simply WTFing trump. Unfortunately Trump is a hot mess and we are seeing him unable to properly lead. Who goes to the CIA and bitches about the media for 9 minutes out of 15, talk about not knowing your audience or respecting the hollowed grounds and the sacrifice of 167 (?) KIA CIA agents. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Trump isn&#39;t a dumby. You play ball with intelligence agencies, or they remove you from office one way or another. That&#39;s just plain history. He was marketing himself before he was sworn in. Now that he is the president, he will be operating under different rules. Remember, the Director of the CIA serves at the pleasure of the president. Brush up on your U.S. History before assuming. Before he was an outsider, now he&#39;s the boss. That&#39;s two different roles you have to play.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The President may be a puppet, but it doesn&#39;t matter. He&#39;s the face of the Nation now. And like it or not, he&#39;s the leader of many organizations he was critical of before being elected. Now that he is the &quot;face&quot; of those organizations, he will tend to act differently. A true leader knows the difference between a time to critique and a time to lead.<br/>
The Mossad and CIA are joined at the hip, there is much Israeli influence within the U.S. Government, but I doubt they control the CIA. I tend not to speculate without physical evidence on things, you know making assumptions.</p>
