    <div class="md"><p>I went today as well and was surprised at how well I thought of it.   I&#39;ve seen all the big gatherings over the last few years (Glenn beck, Jon Stewart, etc) and this was the most supportive, cohesive group, considerate group I&#39;ve witnessed.    Their concerns are deeply personal and legitimate and they&#39;ve been provoked by both sides for a while.    Used as tools really.     I would think there is great potential at earning them as lasting allies simply by alleviating unfounded fears as a starter.    </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I know, I know.  I&#39;ve been following all the Goldman Sachs appointments, the Dyncorp advisors... My pick was Bernie.  But Hillary stole it from Bernie.  Hillary labels herself liberal and progressive. She pretends she has helped women, gays, the poor and EVERYBODY.  But really she&#39;s nothing but a self-serving grifter and a puppet for the elite.   Democrats like Hillary have used social justice issues as a “look over here” technique, while they get on their knees and suck off the Wall Street, banks, global elite.<br/>
At the very least Trump stopped the TPP. We need jobs here in the U.S.  I&#39;m sick of ivy-league liberals conceding that, yes, some people lose out as we globalize. Yeah - how about the entire working class gets slammed, spreading up to the middle class, and down to the poor.  There needs to be some limit to what we will let the horde of locusts (global corporatists) suck out of the U.S.  At least Trump seems to acknowledge that.   And the Republicans are trying to audit the Fed.  Good for them. Did the Democrats do that?  Oh no, the banks and Wall Street and the Fed are sacrosanct. I know that Trump’s appointments are looking pretty sketchy.  Can&#39;t I just have a few more days of hope? (When will I learn, I bought the whole “hope and change” thing 8 years ago and that asshole ended up being a major war monger and the biggest cheerleader for the TPP.  What should I have expected from an ivy-leaguer -- they just know best don’t they?)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Seriously?  Why do you even say that?  The Democrats, (and I am one), and the establishment Republicans have been conducting wars for the last 8 years, and have been angling to go to war with Russia.   Trump seems to acknowledge that Americans have had enough.  Maybe this anti-war sentiment doesn&#39;t stem from a touchy, feely place.  But just from a practical standpoint, Americans know deep down that we&#39;re getting too poor to subsidize the military industrial complex to the extent that they want.    </p>

<p>Besides, they weren&#39;t only talking about &quot;women&#39;s rights&quot; (reproductive rights, gender equality) issues at the various marches. Several of the speakers professed generally leftist viewpoints. To them, unemployment is a &quot;women&#39;s rights issue&quot;; foreign policy is a &quot;women&#39;s rights issue&quot;; climate change is a &quot;women&#39;s rights issue&quot;, because, in their words, &quot;women&#39;s rights issues&quot; are human rights issues.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have a theory as to why the women&#39;s march happened. Prior to the Inauguration there were reports in the media that massive amounts of protesters were gathering and planning to protest. In anticipation of complete carnage and destruction in cities across America, an operation was put into place where a woman&#39;s Facebook post about a peaceful march was artificially magnified in popularity with the main goal to flood the streets, where the supposed destruction would take place, with peaceful, kind-hearted  women who would counteract all aggression by paid protesters. After all, even paid protesters aren&#39;t going to harm a bunch of women and children. Also, notice how the Facebook post didn&#39;t get popular until the news of large amounts of protesters were forming. Therefore, all the women marching today were merely decoys keeping the peace and stopping all violent outbreaks from happening so a calm transfer of power could take place.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>They&#39;re just mad about the patriarchy! Or something. Or that Trump bragged about being able to grab women. You know, there are a whole bunch of women that are into that. That throw themselves at money and power. So to me, that statement was neutral. </p>

<p>Women in the US have more opportunity than women in pretty much every other country. They are more college educated. We get preference in custody cases. No one forces a veil over our faces and mutilates our genitals.</p>

<p>So the women&#39;s match, to me, looks petty. </p>
