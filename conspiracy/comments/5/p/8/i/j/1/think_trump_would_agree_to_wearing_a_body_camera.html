        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>&quot;I believe the key to a better world is the transparency of those in power. Whether it is through financial or political means those who seek power from the people must remain accoutable to those they represent. In our current system those in power are allowed to be the most secretive and as we know with more power the pressure to corrupt becomes stronger. To help ourselves we must help dissuade those in power from the temptations of corruption by making them completely transparent and accountable to the people who elected them as representatives of their beliefs, who all know in their hearts what is right and wrong. That is why I would like to put the power back into the hands of the common righteous men and women by requiring all politicians to wear body cameras or be video recorded at all times to ensure we the people are in fact being represented truthfully. Part of volunteering for a political position should be the sacrifice of freedom by that politician for as long as they are in power, because if they truly are in it for good reasons they have nothing to hide. End secrecy of authority. Give power back to the people, where it belongs. Every signature share or like is one step closer to a real solution and peaceful political revolution&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well if elect officials were forced to wear body cams 24/7 then obviously it couldn&#39;t be live streamed... just like cops don&#39;t live stream... so you&#39;d run into the same issues with post event censoring. It just don&#39;t work stop being silly.</p>

<p>How do you figure that?</p>

<p>I know you REALLY want everyone to trust the FBI but until they prove they can be trusted why should we? They have literally helped cover up the stuff you claim they are getting ready to expose. Give one good reason they deserve the people&#39;s trust without a fundamental change in transparency.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Until I see the real conspirators in cuffs I will continue to assume that the FBI is in their pockets still. When did they suddenly gain credibility amongst the skeptics of authority? I appreciate what your doing in attempting to show that there are in fact still good guys fighting in the shadows for good, but at this point I have seen nothing whatsoever to come to that conclusion myself. The FBI was compromised to evil interests long ago and I&#39;ve seen nothing to suggest thats changed. Please enlighten me on how they are any different than the other alphabets.</p>
