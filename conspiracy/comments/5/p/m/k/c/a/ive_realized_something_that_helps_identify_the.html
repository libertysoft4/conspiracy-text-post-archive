I&#39;ve been subbed to Conspiracy for 5 years now but always lurked until very recently. The one thing that&#39;s stuck with me is just how nice ya&#39;ll are when someone is genuinely trying to learn. Especially with the current influx of disinfo agents on here it is a very noticeable difference. </p>

<p>I guess I just made this post cause I wanted to say thanks guys. You&#39;ve helped me feel not so alone in the process of waking up more and more every day. Our reality is what we make of it, and I know that we will have a bright future ahead. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Exactly! And it&#39;s so easy to see who is really interested in helping others, because all you have to do is ask questions. The shills are never interested in educating, they just shout you down for questioning their narrative. And in then end that&#39;s what this board is all about, questioning our reality and place in the world together. No one is able to know it all on their own. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It seems to me like it&#39;s the shills who ask for sources.  It&#39;s a good way to shut people up, particularly on conspiracy topics since any &quot;good&quot; source is going to agree with the official narrative.</p>

<p>The key difference in my opinion is that genuine people can explain why it is that they believe what they believe.  Maybe they don&#39;t have the best argument, but at least they have reasons.  Their argument will follow the rules of logic, even if it comes to the wrong conclusion due to trusting the wrong evidence.  Shills, on the other hand, don&#39;t want to do anything other than tell you that you&#39;re wrong.  Their job is to regurgitate certain opinions, not justify them.  Indeed, It&#39;s hard to justify an opinion you don&#39;t actually hold, which is why they so often claim that anyone who disagrees is a shill, as that then provides an excuse for not engaging in a debate.</p>

<p>People with honest opinions will share as much of their reasoning with you as they can to try to change your mind.  Shills, on the other hand, only want to discredit you.  Asking for sources and calling people shills are tools for discrediting people.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well IMO not nice, <strong>but willing to provide information</strong>. Like I&#39;ve had to make 100 different IDs because I&#39;m perpetually being banned from the main subs, but I&#39;ve been here for years now and I&#39;ve been on conspiracy forums and reading about that shit for my entire adult life. I can be a <strong>total dick to people who argue with me</strong> (and that&#39;s why I get banned from main subs) but the second somebody genuinely (not in a douche way where they demand &quot;citations&quot; like they&#39;re your 10th grade english teacher) asks for info, I will gladly spend an entire hour compiling sources, links and materials for them to check out. I will gladly write huge explanations of what is happening based upon the info I&#39;ve gathered over the course of the past decade+ of life on these matters. </p>

<p>And most people who are &quot;real&quot; would do the same <strong>because they understand that the only way things are ever going to get better is if people wake the fuck up!</strong></p>

    <div class="md"><p>Reddit is mostly liberal and mostly young. And of the young liberal contingent, most of them are the weirdos with no outside social life. They&#39;re the worst of the worst. They&#39;re the most brainwashed. The most media infused. The most fucked up.</p>

<p>The rest of the world is not far behind them but basically you get the most extreme of the most extreme here because those without super-strong opinions probably just lurk more often than comment / vote. So it becomes a case of the most insane being the most vocal. </p>

<p>Seriously, fuck Reddit tho. This website is the biggest shithole on the net besides Tumblr. If Tumblr is the asshole of the online world then Reddit is an armpit or something. It&#39;s gross.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>But that is your flaw. You retaliate back. That is the goal, to derail your thoughts and credibility. When you inject emotion into your post, others can no longer see the knowledge, wisdom, or credibility in your post, because they see you come from a place of emotion and not critical thinking.</p>

<p>Whether these &quot;shills&quot; or &quot;trolls&quot; realize what thy are doing or not, that is besides the point. They do not realize they are ultimately providing opportunities to help others learn and awaken.</p>

<p>Let me show you an example:</p>

<p>You</p>

<p>&quot;Here are some proven facts about how this media outlet got caught LYING on camera!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Shill&quot; -</p>

<p>&quot;Lol you trump supporters will do anything to give yourselves a pat on the back.&quot;</p>

<p>You -</p>

<p>&quot;You are just ignorant and want to ignore facts! You are just a troll shill, I have no time for idiots like you. Accept the facts or get the fuck out&quot;.</p>

<p>In this case, the &quot;shill&quot; has won. While you took your time to search for and present material to the public for discussion, you blinded yourself and discredited your contribution in 1 comment. The moment you add emotion to it, perception changes. &quot;Accept or gtfo&quot; now adds an element of personal agenda, as you have eliminated any chance for discussion. The &quot;expert advice&quot; we have all come to distrust is what you presented yourself as.</p>

<p>That&#39;s okay, because you are here now and can learn! Always plenty of time to learn and improve yourself to be a better communicator.</p>

<p>This comment alone did not discredit you, do not fret! This was secondary to the <em>root</em> of the problem, which is the title of the post itself. This is a discussion board, so the best way to present something for discussion is in a &quot;neutral&quot; state. &quot;CNN caught blatantly lying on camera!!&quot;. This is a charged statement. You have already convicted CNN of a crime and there is no room left to discuss this topic. It is the equivalent of posting a picture of a news headline with no content. Anyone who is not 100% self aware and in control of the self and their thoughts will enter the thread with a preconfigured mindset. They will want to join in the CNN bashing or fight back.</p>

<p>This thread, whether most realize it it not, was created specifically for fighting. Near impossible to have a meaningful discussion here.</p>

<p>That&#39;s where people like you can come in! Watch this.</p>

<p>&quot;Here are some proven facts about how this media outlet got caught LYING on camera!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Lol you trump supporters will do anything to give yourselves a pat on the back.&quot;</p>

<p>New you (you did your research remember?)</p>

<p>&quot;Here is X media outlet 5 weeks ago making Y statement. Here is the same media outlet and same news anchor saying contradicting statement Z to Y yesterday. I&#39;m not accusing the anchor or network of any wrong doing, but rather pointing out that there are discrepancies and encourage you to simply be aware of news you are consuming. Someone could be feeding them misinformation on purpose to make them look bad or they could be supply it themselves to confuse viewers, or they could be following public opinion in whichever the way the wind is blowing. Don&#39;t focus too hard on the day to day headlines and look at the bigger picture to get a better understanding of the source of your news. You are free to draw your own conclusions from whatever sources you find trustworthy if you feel inclined to go looking. But learn to yourself first, for without that, others will always be able to manipulate you.&quot;</p>

<p>This is all you can do. You must fight the urge to push your own conclusions into people, no matter how &quot;right&quot; you may feel them to be, for you rob another of the chance to learn, grow, and form conclusions of their own. This is the reason society is where it is today. You may have the right intentions of helping, but you unknowingly became a herder of sheep and let them stay dormant.</p>

<p>Have a wonderful day!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well I&#39;m a human bro. I&#39;m not out to socially engineer the world. And IMO phoniness is an awful thing. At the end of the day people need to learn to accept the truth on their own. You can&#39;t weasel up to them and play the game of The Left-Wingers, because you&#39;re always going to lose that way (and that&#39;s why the Right has lost over the last few decades). Trying to manipulate people is <strong>their</strong> game. Telling it like it is, is <strong>our</strong> game, and unless we make them engage in our territory, we&#39;re gonna keep losing.</p>

<p>Trump got people to engage in <strong>our</strong> territory. That&#39;s why he&#39;s won.</p>

<p>I have 3 heros, honestly. They&#39;re all political figures / journalists. Donald Trump, Anne Coulter and Milo Yiannopoulos. If I could become a conservative journalist like one of the ladder, I would be stoked. And it&#39;s not their <strong>positions</strong> that appeal to me, it&#39;s their willingness to antagonize with facts and truth. It&#39;s their willingness to antagonize with anti-political correctness. It&#39;s their willingness to throw the &quot;expectation of behavior&quot; right back into the faces of those stuck up assholes who think they can control everything you do.</p>

<p>If you feel like you&#39;re the type of person who can be phony and fake and you want to channel that ability into pushing the window to the right or where ever it needs to be pushed, I say good for you. I commend you. I look at people like Sean Hannity, or even Bill O&#39;Reilly to a lesser extent, and I have some respect for them. They play ball and we would be lost in a socialist nightmare without them. Not everyone is able to play ball. I&#39;m not someone who wants to play ball. Esp when I&#39;m just posting on the web.</p>

<p>But you know man, I sure hear what you&#39;re saying, technically. I just think it&#39;s only half-right.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, you are right, this is only half. I only spoke of building a solid ideological foundation for action, not discussing the action itself. No action can be taken here. This is a two dimensional board speaking of the three dimensional world you and I perceive. Here, thoughts can be manipulated and altered to those with little to no foundation that can go into 3 dimensional and perceptible world and cause change. If they read your post saying &quot;this person is right, here are the facts, go make the change&quot;. True/incorrect, right/wrong, left/right, you have programmed a robot. You input code and sent the robot into the world to complete a task.</p>

<p>You are human. I am human. The person you programmed is a human, but yet they are still a slave doing your bidding. </p>

<p>While I agree with your viewpoint of apposing the systematic enslavement of society, I fully understand it and how I came to these conclusions, and the history behind it. I did this under my own will.</p>

<p>That is more important than you think.</p>

<p>So long as you rob people the chance to draw their own conclusions, slavery will continue. No constitutional amendment will ever take it away. I understand your frustration and anger, as I was, too.</p>

<p>As for revealing the second half of the truth you seek, you have already done it. You revealed to me your own truth, and it is your choice whether to walk through the door you opened or not. You see your passion. You need confirmation from nobody. Be what you want to be.</p>

<p>You are here investigating and reporting now. You already walked through the door, you just didn&#39;t notice it. Don&#39;t let fame and recognition distort your views and lead you astray. The number of people you reach is less important than reaching anyone at all. Find your own way, for it is the only real way for you.</p>

<p>Ego is a veil that blinds. Those with ego survive on the drug of fame. The desire to be known.</p>

<p>I thank you from one human to another for bringing truth to others, as it is important. Just remember that not everyone may be ready for it right away. That&#39;s okay! Change happens at different speeds in everyone. You may affect their life in 3 minutes, days, weeks, months, years! Do not be impatient. Instant gratification breeds complacency. Your own mind will stop growing and expanding if everyone takes everything you say at face value right away. You will assume it to be the end point, so why expand more? If you find yourself stuck at a dead end, do as nature does and branch out!</p>

<p>If you inspire just one person in your entire life, and that person goes on to inspire a million, do you feel jealousy? Is this not the same thing that has kept society back for so long?</p>

<p>Humans love watching themselves. I have seen it in my past self and understand how it holds us back. We ourselves are a veil that hides truth.</p>

<p>I see your passion and hope you continue. Beware of traps that lie ahead. Knowledge is real power in this world.</p>

<p>I created this account recently after lurking for years just to try and promote positive discussion. This sub has always been an awesome place for unbridled thoughts and discussion. If this sub did end up belly up I would regret not trying to do anything about it.</p>

<p>Unfortunately we will likely never get back to the &quot;old days&quot;.  Negative vibes from all sides have hijacked reddit. Hopefully more people like you will start engaging in the conversation. Guess we actually have to work now rather than freeloading. I was part of the Great Digg Migration and I hope history isn&#39;t repeating itself.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;Progressives&quot; have three main identifying characteristics, in my observation.</p>

<p>a}  Malevolence.</p>

<p>The mockery and abuse of civilian investigators of the Clinton Foundation on 4chan, by members of Correct the Record, was among the worst I&#39;ve seen.  Referring to everyone as neckbearded rejects and freaks, condescension, and at times openly bragging about the size of the income they were receiving, in return for promoting lies and being vicious to people.</p>

<p>b}  Hypocrisy.</p>

<p>The aforementioned malevolence is extremely selective in its&#39; targets.  If you have the correct political or economic opinions, and are a member of the correct demographics, then you will not be subjected to it; however, if you&#39;re not a member of the in-crowd, you can expect to be.  The type of people I&#39;m talking about here promote the #LOVETRUMPSHATE hashtag on the one hand, but make excuses for Trump voters being the targets of physical violence on the other.  Again, if people are a member of the group you&#39;re opposed to, then any form of bad treatment of them is justifiable.  It&#39;s only wrong if they are your people.</p>

<p>c}  Complete incapacity for tolerating any form of dissent, disagreement, or opposing opinion to their own, and a desire to bury that dissent and ensure that no one sees it.</p>

<p>Progressives do not remotely care about the ability to impartially or freely share or express information, regardless of the nature or content of said information.  They care exclusively about whether or not a given piece of information, or opinion, is in support of their consensus.  If it is not, then in their minds it is viewed as a form of disloyalty and is to be buried at all costs.  This is the nature of most subs on Reddit; they are self-reinforcing echo chambers.  If you express opinion which is contrary to the consensus of that particular subreddit, then you can reliably expect to be banned from it.  People do not like having their bubble threatened.</p>

<p>If you see the above three characteristics in a given post, the chances are exceptionally good that you&#39;re looking at a shill.  Another usual indication is the account in question being newly created, with virtually no previous posting history, or thread or comment karma.</p>

<p>Similar to their own group that the elites have, we know we must have a similar group that works together.</p>

<p>Many of us know we Dont know everything and the theories we do hold are just theories and need to be challenged always.</p>

<p>If we see someone wants to contribute, we assist and are kind, because we want them to &#39;catch up&#39; and then bring in something that helps all of us. Like a new perspective.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve learned A LOT from other peoples perspectives, but I&#39;ve also learned how to look at things/situations differently to see the complete picture. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Exactly! And it&#39;s so easy to see who is really interested in helping others, because all you have to do is ask questions. The shills are never interested in educating, they just shout you down for questioning their narrative. And in then end that&#39;s what this board is all about, questioning our reality and place in the world together. No one is able to know it all on their own. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It seems to me like it&#39;s the shills who ask for sources.  It&#39;s a good way to shut people up, particularly on conspiracy topics since any &quot;good&quot; source is going to agree with the official narrative.</p>

<p>The key difference in my opinion is that genuine people can explain why it is that they believe what they believe.  Maybe they don&#39;t have the best argument, but at least they have reasons.  Their argument will follow the rules of logic, even if it comes to the wrong conclusion due to trusting the wrong evidence.  Shills, on the other hand, don&#39;t want to do anything other than tell you that you&#39;re wrong.  Their job is to regurgitate certain opinions, not justify them.  Indeed, It&#39;s hard to justify an opinion you don&#39;t actually hold, which is why they so often claim that anyone who disagrees is a shill, as that then provides an excuse for not engaging in a debate.</p>

<p>People with honest opinions will share as much of their reasoning with you as they can to try to change your mind.  Shills, on the other hand, only want to discredit you.  Asking for sources and calling people shills are tools for discrediting people.</p>
