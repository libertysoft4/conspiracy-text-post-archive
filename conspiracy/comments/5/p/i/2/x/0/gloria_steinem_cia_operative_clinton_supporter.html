<p><em>“I really feel that she’s not a lion of feminism, but a lamb of feminism,” said Kathie Sarachild, a member of Redstockings who is often associated with coining the phrase “Sisterhood is powerful.” In the mid-1970s, as Ms. took off, Redstockings criticized Ms. Steinem for having once worked for a C.I.A.-financed organization that recruited Americans to attend Communist-run youth festivals in Vienna and Helsinki in 1959 and 1962. The group’s backing was first exposed in 1967 in Ramparts magazine, then in The Washington Post and The New York Times.&quot;</em> - <a href="https://archive.is/YynS7">https://archive.is/YynS7</a></p>

<p><strong>The Feminist Movement - What Happened and Why?</strong> - <a href="https://archive.is/Tg7lq">https://archive.is/Tg7lq</a></p>

<p><em>In the 1960s when second wave feminism was born there were two branches of Feminism. One, has been repressed. The other celebrated. One was Friedan’s and later Gloria Steinem’s. It was a gender only movement fighting for gender equality within the United States as it was, with its racial and class hierarchy. It was dominated by privileged educated women. The other branch of the women’s movement was the class conscious “Women’s Liberation Movement” which emerged from the radical Anti- War and Civil Rights movements.</em></p>

<p><em>The original Women’s Liberation Movement was a movement of both race and class integration, a vision of justice for all. It saw female liberation as the basis for social revolution.  The original movement embraced race, class and gender.  As a founding mother of the Women’s Liberation Movement which was as enthusiastic as it was naive, none of us imagined the influence of the CIA on our movement. Through CIA subversion led by Steinem, and our naivete, the movement became a largely gender essentialist, set of projects within the capitalist system. It became an attempt to create equality for women with a system of ever greater economic and social inequality.</em></p>

<p>This current movement seems to not only have infiltrators, but to almost completely be directed by those infiltrators. </p>

<p>Their mission statement seems like it came straight out of a politician&#39;s mouth. There&#39;s no specifics, just words that will make people think that what they&#39;re doing is good. </p>

<p>It seems like the intelligence community is generating as much chaos as possible to punish those who didn&#39;t give into their preferred candidate. </p>

<p>All the Russia stuff for example seemed less thought out than half the conspiracy theories on this sub.</p>

<p>But I&#39;m sure if there&#39;s any way the World Bank or IMF can make more money, they&#39;ll do it.</p>

<p>The IMF usually offers a failed state a loan with enormous interest, coerces them into taking it, and then keeps them from climbing out of the hole and continues to abuse them for decades.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m on mobile so I haven&#39;t read all OPs links and don&#39;t have access to my sources. As such this comment is probably totally useless but just in case it helps knit together stuff from the OP:</p>

<p>Steinem infiltrates socialist groups in Europe for the CIA. When she returns to America, she starts working as a reporter. Soon after, the women&#39;s liberation movement starts picking up steam. After some time, Steinem is thrust into the limelight as the spokesperson for feminism for the mainstream media. The only problem is, none of the feminists have ever heard of her before. She has not been prominent or particlarly active in women&#39;s groups, so the women start to wonder where the fuck she came from.</p>

<p>Steinem co-founds Ms Magazine, by far the most influential (inexplicably successful, really) feminist publication of the 20th century and still the most circulated hard copy feminist publication today. A group of radical feminists accuse Steinem of still working for the CIA and of deliberately sabotaging the movement to make it more liberal (e.g. identity politics). They are ignored, because after all Steinem is the unofficial spokeswoman of the feminist movement. Over the time Ms Magazine and Gloria Steinem push harder for identity politics, one small part of what has lead us today to the point where mainstream feminism serves only to divide people. What was once a class-based social movement that, however you feel about it, certainly had potential and some early wins by harnessing the sheer number of women out there now does the opposite because of the heady mix of call-out culture and Oppression Olympics.</p>

<p>So basically the theory is that Steinem never stopped working for the CIA and was involved in Operation Mockingbird/COINTELPRO activities to undermine feminism, to push it away from being any threat to tptb and instead harness it to further entrench the inability of the populace to unite against them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t think it&#39;s unlikely that the CIA helped her, I think it&#39;s unlikely that she is some cover agent. I think it&#39;s more likely she is a radical feminist with decisive ideas that was helped becuase of her ideas. Whos gonna go undercover for 60 years to pretend to be a feminist?</p>

<p>Having a vagina is not a political platform.    </p>

<p>What the fuck is going on here?  Our country has been at war for 15 years in 7 countries, there was a 2008 bailout of <em>criminal</em> system wide financial institutions, there is NSA spying, the Patriot Act, NDAA, and torture.   </p>

<p>But what get&#39;s people out in the streets?  Some vague identity politics bullshit. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The &quot;Recolutionary movement&quot; was funded by Moscow and was thoroughly communist.  As ugly as the FBI etc have been, we shouldn&#39;t forget some of the ties of the radicals.</p>

<p>Frankly, both international capitalism and communism have Jewish roots and represent a Jewish schism.</p>

<p>The zionists are the capitalists who want a world empire built on trade with Jerusalem as its jewel.</p>

<p>The communists are atheist Jews who nevertheless believe in Kabbalah and want a Jewish secular world empire.</p>

<p>Both are projects that seek to make the world&#39;s people into cattle, and ultimately introduce worship of Lucifer and use technology and transhumanism to build a tower back into heaven.</p>

<p>This is why they sometimes work together, but sometimes fight.  Undoubtedly, whoever has the most success gets brownie points and a higher office in Lucifer&#39;s kingdom.</p>
