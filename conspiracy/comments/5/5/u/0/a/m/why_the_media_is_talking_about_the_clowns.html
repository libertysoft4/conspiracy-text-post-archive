        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Other than the obvious reason that it is necessary to report on certain events, I have a few other theories why we have been hearing so much about the clown events, but little about major political happenings...or the important events we see only on alternative news sites.</p>

<p>1) It inspires copycat incidents. The more they report on it, the more likely some idiot is going to want to do it, too. Already at my school we have been warned about being targeted by clown activities. That is scary as hell.</p>

<p>2) It incites fear for all levels of our population, especially children and people who have children. There are a number of studies on how fear impacts people (a simple Google search will help you there). Fear helps control an environment. Clearly, they do not just do this with the clowns. They do it with events all of the time.</p>

<p>3) They want to hide the real, rampant pedophilia going on. I&#39;m not denying these cases aren&#39;t real. However, we all know the real pedophilia that happens, especially in wealthy groups, is rarely if ever reported on. As always, we are lead to believe only the people in society could commit such atrocities. We will never hear about the unspeakable tragedies that go on daily by government officials.</p>

<p>4) This clearly is not just about clowns. It is a reminder to examine every news story. Every time I see a popular news item, I ask, &quot;What is their purpose?&quot; With just a little critical thinking, it becomes obvious on the purpose and intentions.</p>

<p>Please wish me a safe day at work.</p>

<p>Scary clowns have faded from culture. What better way to bring it back than release some photos or videos of people terrified by clowns.</p>

<p>You get copy cats around the country and it goes viral. Momentum will remain strong the entire month of October and rear its ugly head back out next year</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Clowns are a trigger for monarchs.  So if you have people with DID, you give them key phrases in the media or show them imagery and it activates them to carry out some preplanted mission (manchurian candidate / jason bourne / timebomb with michael biehn).   Similar with blue butterflies, the phrase &#39;the rose knows&#39; and a few others outlined in operation mind control, although that was 20-30 yrs ago I&#39;m sure they have new ones now.</p>

<p>I think childrens&#39; owls, overt checkerboards/devils diamonds, certain numbers (7,777), white rabbits, and very high tophats are all other triggers</p>

<hr/>

<p>They hinted at this clown thing in a scene in the Netflix show stranger things.  I&#39;ll dig up something we talked about here on thisvery subject</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Also, frequently when things like this happen, one of my immediate assumptions is that a movie or show is being promoted. Things like this have happened time and time again and turned out to be a movie promotion. I will edit and post examples if I can think of any.</p>

<p>There is a reboot of the Stephen King&#39;s IT--the original scary clown movie--coming out in 2017. In addition to the general distraction that these sightings are good for, they may also being used to promote a movie.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You raise several great points. My theory: they are going to use the media to convince people that the events in which an unarmed man who is dressed a certain way and acts a certain way is liable to be shot if a person believes they are a threat to justify what has been going on in our country referencing the murdering of many civilians who are mostly African American. They will compare the two demeanors and rule both as threatening and justify the cause for eradication of a culture by making it not illegal but life threatening to participate in the culture of hip hop or urban style. Sounds crazy and far fetched. Just trying to think like the enemy who posses not only infinite knowledge of the mid class and everyone be low that but also very intelligent counsel who map these social movements into play. Before you know it, there will be 10 dead clowns a week and most if not all charges will be pardoned. Happy Halloween. </p>

<p>It&#39;s all about keeping people in a state of fear, everything you see on the news is. A populace who are scared are easier to control, and a populace who are scared will call on the government to fix the things causing fear, therefore legitimising the need for government. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Fun fact OP, there was also a wave of nationwide clown sightings in the early 1980s. These ones however were not promoted by national media, indeed it wasn&#39;t even understood that the sightings were occurring on a national scale until long afterward. The clown sightings in the 80s were almost all reported by children, many of whom claimed the clowns were attempting to lure them into vans and wooded areas using money and candy. Adults in many cases were unable to even verify the clowns existed, and for that reason they were dubbed &quot;phantom clowns&quot;. They seemed to have been related to cult crime and Satanic ritual abuse, at least the few records I&#39;ve seen have mentioned them in this context to some degree. They essentially have mythological status at this point, you can go searching for &quot;phantom clowns&quot; and learn more, although from what I&#39;ve seen the information is sparse. I don&#39;t doubt that many modern sightings are copycats popping up directly as a result of the media, but nevertheless, to me, there seems to be something occult about all of this.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think it started as viral marketing for Stephen King&#39;s IT. There were no real clowns just rumors. Then it turned into standalone complex copycat behavior when there was no true person to copy. Now it&#39;s becoming more popular in the media so more and more copycats are happening. Mass hysteria</p>
