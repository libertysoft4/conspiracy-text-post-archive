    <div class="md"><p>At least he lived long enough to talk about 9/11 and Dubya. There&#39;s a radio interview with him on Youtube from the day or two after 9-11 and he calls it fairly well, and talks of false flags and such.</p>

<p>I loved this one piece he wrote about Dubya in 2001- it&#39;s from an article titled &quot;Jesus Hated bald Pussy&quot;:</p>

<p>Let&#39;s face it, the yo-yo president of the U.S.A. knows nothing. He is a dunce. He does what he is told to do, says what he is told to say, poses the way he is told to pose. He is a fool.</p>

<p>No. Nonsense. The president cannot be a Fool. Not at this moment in time, when the last living vestiges of the American Dream are on the line. This is not the time to have a bogus rich kid in charge of the White House.</p>

<p>Which is, after all, our house. That is our headquarters, it is where the heart of America lives. So if the president lies and acts giddy about other people&#39;s lives, if he wantonly and stupidly endorses mass murder by definition, a loud and meaningless animal with no functional intelligence and no balls.</p>

<p>To say this goofy child president is looking more and more like Richard Nixon in the summer of 1974 would be a flagrant insult to Nixon.</p>

<p>Whoops! Did I say that? Is it even vaguely possible that some New Age Republican whore-beast of a false president could actually make Richard Nixon look like a Liberal?</p>

<p>The capacity of these vicious assholes we elected to be in charge of our lives for four years to commit terminal damage to our lives and our souls and our loved ones is far beyond Nixon&#39;s. Shit! Nixon was the creator of many of the once-proud historical landmarks that these dumb bastards are savagely destroying now: the Clean Air Act of 1970; Campaign Finance Reform; the endangered species act; a Real-Politik dialogue with China; and on and on.</p>

<p>The prevailing quality of life in America-by any accepted methods of measuring-was inarguably freer and more politically open under Nixon than it is today in this evil year of our Lord 2002.</p>

<p>The Boss was a certified monster who deserved to be impeached and banished. He was a truthless creature of former FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover, a foul human monument to corruption and depravity on a scale that dwarfs any other public official in American history. But Nixon was at least smart enough to understand why so many honorable patriotic U.S. citizens despised him. He was a Liar. The truth was not in him.</p>

<p>Nixon believed, as he said many times, that if the president of the United States does it, it can&#39;t be illegal. But Nixon never understood the much higher and meaner truth of Bob Dylan&#39;s warning that &quot;To live outside the law you must be honest.&quot;</p>

<p>The difference between an outlaw and a war criminal is the difference between a pedophile and a Pederast: The pedophile is a person who thinks about sexual behavior with children, and the Pederast does these things. He lays hands on innocent children, he penetrates them and changes their lives forever.</p>

<p>Being the object of a pedophile&#39;s warped affections is a Routine feature of growing up in America, and being a victim of a Pederast&#39;s crazed &quot;love&quot; is part of dying. Innocence is no longer an option. Once penetrated, the child becomes a Queer in his own mind, and that is not much different than murder.</p>

<p>Richard Nixon crossed the line when he began murdering foreigners in the name of &quot;family values&quot;- and George Bush crossed it when he sneaked into office and began killing brown skinned children in the name of Jesus and the American people.</p>

<p>When Muhammad Ali declined to be drafted and forced to kill &quot;gooks&quot; in Vietnam he said, &quot;I ain&#39;t got nothin&#39; against them Viet Cong. No Cong ever called me Nigger.&quot;
I agreed with him, according to my own personal ethics and values. He was right.</p>

<p>If we all had a dash of Muhammad Ali&#39;s eloquent courage, this country and the world would be a better place today because of it. Okay. That&#39;s it for now. Read it and weep....See you tomorrow, folks. You haven&#39;t heard the last of me. I am the one who speaks for the spitit of freedom and decency in you. Shit. Somebody has to do it.
We have become a Nazi monster in the eyes of the whole world-a nation of bullies and bastards who would rather kill than live peacefully. We are not just Whores for power and oil, but killer whores with hate and fear in our hearts. We are human scum, and that is how history will judge us... No redeeming social value. Just whores. Get out of our way, or we&#39;ll kill you.</p>

<p>Well, shit on that dumbness. George W. Bush does not speak for me or my son or my mother or my friends or the people I respect in this world. We didn&#39;t vote for these cheap, greedy little killers who speak for America today- and we will not vote for them again in 2002. Or 2004. Or ever.</p>

<p>Who does vote for these dishonest shitheads? Who among us can be happy and proud of having all this innocent blood on our hands? Who are these swine? These flag-sucking half-wits who get fleeced and fooled by stupid little rich kids like George Bush? They are the same ones who wanted to have Muhammad Ali locked up for refusing to kill &quot;gooks&quot;. They speak for all that is cruel and stupid and vicious in the American character. They are racists and hate mongers among us-they are the Ku Klux Klan. I piss down the throats of these Nazis. And I am too old to worry about whether they like it or not. Fuck them.</p>
