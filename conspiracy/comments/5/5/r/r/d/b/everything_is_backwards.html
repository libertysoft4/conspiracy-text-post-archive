<p>Watch this video it just spins and spins, the north star is exactly in the middle. If we live in a computer matrix of sorts like some scientists claim, then that could be the glass ceiling with stars painted on. Sounds retarded to anyone but I suggest you keep an open mind and look into some documentaries. The shills say I&#39;m a shill, but I&#39;ve gotta say it, it&#39;s the pinnacle, you don&#39;t need to believe it but I don&#39;t suggest ridiculing it.</p>

<p>There&#39;s a 2 hour documentary. Science has explanations to everything but once you switch your perspective from one to the other you can&#39;t go back. I looked into flat earth on a whim but I can&#39;t go back now, especially since the tilt is exactly 66.6 degrees. Too perfect. NASA is fake, horizon is flat, water is flat. No real proof of the sphere earth. I am left with more questions than answers. </p>

<p>Just like Mr Dubay says, if we were all flat earth believers we&#39;d think the sphere earthers were retarded.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t understand how that proves the sphere earth. I watched the whole thing. That&#39;s arguing that the sun casts a shadow at one point and not the other. Big deal. The sun is above head on one obelisk and not directly above it on the other. That&#39;s like logic used to fool children. Sorry.</p>

<p>I am still saying the sun spins around the equator based on the time of year it will be farther to the north and other times of year it will be more south. If one obelisk is directly below the equator or closer to the equator and the other obelisk is farther north then yes one is going to cast a shadow and the other is not. Just because the video says the only proof is a sphere earth does not mean it&#39;s true. I hope you can understand my response.</p>

<p>I am not saying science doesn&#39;t have answers, because it does, which is why as Lady Gaga would say, it&#39;s the &quot;perfect illusion.&quot;</p>

<p>I just believe there is proof standing against it. Flat waters, fake pictures, 66.6 earth tilt, so many. They all claim there is no other answer to the globe earth which is why it&#39;s deceiving so many. As you know from shill tactics 101, if you control both sides of the argument it&#39;s fairly easy to win the argument. </p>

<p>Edit: Using those obelisks you could probably predict exactly how far away the sun is, and I&#39;ll give you my answer, it&#39;s pretty damn close to the earth.</p>

Arguing against centuries old proven scientific fact on which a large portion of our understanding of the universe derives only paints all the other things you say in a negative light.

    <div class="md"><p>So many down votes.. I been looking into flat earth for quite sometime now and I still don&#39;t know what to believe so I put it to rest.  But something inside me keeps thinking about it and questioning it. Although I&#39;m not 100% on flat earth or sphere earth I still love to listen to people who talk about it. Always learn something new. But it is true that you cant see any curvature when in an airplane. At all. You would at least see alittle. And I know someone did an experiment with a very strong laser and it proved there was not near as much as a curvature as they say. Not enough to be a sphere. But maybe the earth is way bigger than we are told so that&#39;s why it still looks flat when in an airplane? Eh idk. Too many questions lol. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>So the fact that scientists have recorded stars moving (in particular, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barnard%27s_Star">Bernard&#39;s Star</a>) in just the past couple of decades doesn&#39;t change your view any?

<p>Watch that, I think we live inside a very elaborate computer program of sorts. We&#39;ve never been to space we don&#39;t know what it is. Sounds nuts but I won&#39;t go back there&#39;s too many things that don&#39;t make sense. </p>

<p>For example we &quot;ride&quot; the curve of the earth on plane flights. That gives the impression that the earth spins under us, but it doesn&#39;t because the atmosphere comes with us. Also another reason it doesn&#39;t make sense is because using that same logic, once you are in the southern hemisphere shouldn&#39;t you ride the curve of the earth down to ride the curve, instead of going above the massive hill the equator would be? They don&#39;t do that also.</p>

<p>The stars don&#39;t move one single bit over decades and decades. Isn&#39;t everything orbiting something? I took science and passed all my high school courses but I can&#39;t unsee what I&#39;ve seen. Also the earth tilt is 23.4 degrees. a right angle is 90 degrees. 90-23.4 = 66.6.</p>

<p>The odds of all that? a million to one in my opinion.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The star with the largest proper motion is Barnard&#39;s star which moves about 10 arcseconds (0.003 degrees) per year. A more typical proper motion is about 0.1 arcseconds a year.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The atmosphere travels with the earth because they are part of one system.  The friction from the Earth causes air particles to be dragged with it as it spins.  Those particles hit more particles that move them and so on.  Also gravity.</p>

<p>The flight thing would be best answered by someone else, but AFAIK, they take jet streams into consideration and then you have layovers and what not.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I strongly suggest you rethink it. You&#39;re doing the shill work by calling flat earthers shills. I need proof to believe something and I see absolutely no reason to believe the sphere earth. If it wasn&#39;t fake why wouldn&#39;t NASA show us a real picture? Why would the flight paths be perfect on a flat earth map? Why would the water be flat? Why would you be able to see skylines perfectly from farther distances than they claim? Why is the earth tilt exactly 66.6?</p>

<p>I just have 0 proof to believe it. I followed our governments track record. They lie about everything else, why stop there? </p>

<p>Add to the vaccines - EX senior CDC scientist whistleblower William Thompson has documents proving CDC manipulated and change the study on MMR link to vaccines. Rep Bill Posey of FL took the floor at the senate and asked for an investigation on the fraud at the CDC. No one cares and not a word in the media. Autism now 1 in 50. </p>

<p>GMOs will help feed other countries (lol then why are so many countries still starving and why are some scientists (the ones who give a shit) telling us it&#39;s not good. I mean what makes anyone think changing the DNA in something natural we eat makes it better? Seems very dumb to me.</p>

<p>We invaded Iraq and Afganistan (or maybe it was Pakistan)  after 9/11 because they had &#39;weapons of mass destruction.&#39; Killed thousands to find out there was none. But hey at least they both got federal reserves, lol. Coincidence or na?</p>

<p>Black Lives Matter movement started because police keep killing blacks, with many on camera. But if you really look into it many of these are faked for the media to start a race war. To turn us all against one another and spread fear and hate. They want us against eachother, not THEM. </p>

<p>Sugar isn&#39;t all that bad! Lol jk it is actually terrible for your body and during a carscan of the brain it has the same effects as some drugs. Not in a good way. It also causes cancer and helps cancer grow. </p>

<p>Did I mention cancer? That terrible disease that kills perfectly once healthy people and there isn&#39;t really a cure? 
well actually they probably weren&#39;t healthy because your doctors are blind and don&#39;t know what true health is. Going through chemo may kill the cancer if your lucky but will just ruin your body and the cancer will probably come back in a different spot. And if it doesn&#39;t kill the cancer it will just kill you quicker. 
Cancer makes big pharma billions a year.
While there actually is many cures to the many cancers and ways you can avoid it completely. </p>

<p>Minor childhood illness like measles is very deadly! 
Nope it&#39;s a freaking rash and the only way youd ever die is if you have a terrible immune system, or live very unhealthy. It could turn to pneumonia but again only if you were living in poor condition. The CDC uses death rates from around the world to scare people. These minor childhood illnesses like measles is actually very beneficial to our immune system. Strengthens it tremendously. Explains why they want us to take their vaccines. They either don&#39;t work, make you sick/disabled, or kill you. Weakening your immune system and pumping you full of chemicals. And they have the nerve to blame &quot;antivaxxers&quot; for any little outbreak there is. Current one in Arkansas is mumps in young children and they all had been vaccinated. Some recent (probably the ones who started it) </p>

<p>I guess some of this isn&#39;t backwards like you posted but thought it was relevant. Im pretty big about vaccines as I have a 3 year old. Couldn&#39;t imagine injecting her with that crap! 
i&#39;m sure you probably already knew all of this though! (;</p>

<p>This is so true. Don&#39;t believe any common health advice. Your brain needs good amounts of animal fat (butter, cream, lard etc) to function. Without it you become more stupid and easier to manipulate. That&#39;s what the fat scare is about. Go back to eating what people ate in the beginning of the century. Before tptb&#39;s lies.</p>

Combine that with natural drugs like magic mushrooms and cannabis to expand your consciousness and fasting to also grow more brain cells. Definitely fats &gt; carbs. And natural fruits + herbs to clean the body. </p>

<p>Here&#39;s a bunch of random facts. Brain health is #8</p>

<p><a href="https://authoritynutrition.com/10-health-benefits-of-intermittent-fasting/">https://authoritynutrition.com/10-health-benefits-of-intermittent-fasting/</a></p>

<p>There&#39;s another link. Basically Fasting is one of the only things capable of growing new brain cells in humans. I am like 7-10% body fat (not bragging just because that&#39;s my bodies nature) and whenever I want to do a good thinking session to find new ideas and break through I always do a 36 hour fast before I do. By 36 hours your mind is pretty dead, so eat some fruits at 36 hours and start thinking. Your mind will be so clear you will realize what humans are actually capable of. Seriously try it, even 24 hours if it&#39;s your first time. It will blow you away. I know it did the first time I tried it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I would eat grapes or blueberries. And yes sleep counts my friend, even if you look for a day where you think you can sleep for 12 hours you&#39;ll be good. If it&#39;s your first time drink water you will be fine, just really hungry. I remember the first time I did a fast I ate 3k calories within the hour i was done lol. If you feel like you can&#39;t make it don&#39;t feel bad. Ghandi did 106 days I believe. Fasting cleans your body, or begins to. The more it has to clean the more tiring it will be. That&#39;s why I&#39;ve began to fast every day and skip breakfast and all, you get used to it. I don&#39;t like snacking I think 95% of all things humans eat is just pure garbage. </p>

<p>Try for 24 hours but 20 would be fine too. Break the fast with fruits though other things will clog your brain. Also be happy while you fast, some people let the hunger get to them and don&#39;t enjoy it. If you&#39;re happy you&#39;ll get crazy clear thinking. If you start to feel dizzy or something eat the fruits you&#39;ll be okay. :) </p>

<p>Jokes aside, you are right these are good vegetable fats and to eat avocado and coconut oil is no problem. The really bad vegetable fats are processed vegetable oils, found in margarine and all processed foods. Stay away from those. But also please for you own health, realise your ancestry and include at least some cream, butter and eggs into your diet. With that you can stay clear of meat if you want to.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve studied and experimented on this for 5 years. My conclusions on a gold plate for you</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Skip breakfast on weekdays and eat a steady lunch instead. Your body needs that break from digestion. This is the actual secret with the Mediterranean diet. They skip breakfast and have siesta.</p></li>
<li><p>Keep high on animal fats and low on grains and sugar (including the fructose in fruits)</p></li>
<li><p>Brush your teeth with coconut oil. Stay clear of flouride </p></li>
</ul>

<p>Evolution is the best current explanation, and I tend to go with that. The belief system built up today is from the early 1900 (Carrol Quigley) with propaganda and mass media as a corner stone. This was after Darwin. He clashed with the remains of the old belief system - religion, which started to lose it&#39;s dominance during the renaissance when Galileo promoted Copernican heliocentrism and the scientific method.</p>

<p>Get on those animal fats and your mind clears up eventually ;-)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I always skip breakfast I usually fast 16-20 hours a day. Lol. I don&#39;t believe in your theory of only going back a hundred years though I believe in a massive smear campaign that started 1000 years ago. You might be correct with the grain and sugar but I would have to research the grains more. Like I said no one is suggesting grains as a good diet for your mind. The only sources you are using to back grains and animal fats is an evolution theory. I don&#39;t believe eating animals is particularly good for us either. Like I mentioned before I don&#39;t believe in evolution.</p>

<p>I think the truth is science is being hidden and it&#39;s very likely within the Ether. If I could guess I would say, a fruit diet combined with herbs and some sort of liquid with Ether. If the Ether is actually a thing. Maybe if you eat enough fruit your body turns alkaline and your body absorbs it from the air or some sort of thing. I have studied things too my friend. No one I study believes in this bullshit evolution theory either. I listen to herbal doctors of today and listen to what modern doctors say and combine the knowledge. Berries are the main things humans are meant to eat. According to prophecy Jesus brought corn to the natives. So maybe corn before it was GMO&#39;d to shit was very good. I still believe there is a missing piece to humans. They used to drill holes in their skulls for extra oxygen for the brain. I believe holding oxygen in the brain is the key, and to keep it as clean as possible. Jesus fasted for 40 days when he wrote the bible. That&#39;s a true fast, not a BS fast with water or anything. If I could think what he did to prepare for that I would say he pounded back fruits and herbs to clean his body entirely and turn his body as alkaline as possible. </p>

<p>Just my 2 cents we have completely different perspectives. </p>

<p>Edit: I do agree with everything you say, just not the grains I don&#39;t know if they&#39;re good or not. He could be right ladies and gents I just don&#39;t know if fats are truly good or just laid out to be good. Just like sugars are made out to be bad today, the true cure for cancer today is an all fruit diet with strong herbs. Try explaining that to any doctor though, good luck. They&#39;d never believe you because they are taught cancer is fueled by sugar.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I suspect I wrote wrong or that you misunderstood - Go LOW on grains and sugar and HIGH on animal fats. And it&#39;s the dose and duration that makes a poison. One bad meal won&#39;t kill you and one good meal won&#39;t make you healthy.</p>

<p>Fruits are ok in moderation and vegetables great since they contain healthy fibers as opposed to grains. They are however low in energy and that should come mainly from animal fat which is high in calories.</p>

<p>Great that you skip breakfast. One of thee best moves for health.</p>

<p>We disagree on things and I won&#39;t point you to references since  I don&#39;t have time, but remember what I said - The great thing about nutrition is that you can experiment and figure out what makes you feel better. It can take several months however, and initially you can get side effects. I you for example exclude all carbs you can get so called keto rash which is a side effect when the body quickly changes its metabolism to burning fats instead of carbs. But it goes away quickly. Chicken broth and salt ftw</p>

<p>Cancer is not fueled by sugar, and doctors don&#39;t learn that either. What they also don&#39;t learn is that cancer is our bodies natural defense mechanism against toxic overload. It then creates tumors to accumulate the poisons to be dealt with later. When the toxic overload stops the tumors go away. The most common way to get toxic overload and thus cancer today is eating a high grain/sugar diet and frequent meals. Grains and sugar disturbs our microbe balance and the resulting bacterial waste is toxic. So cell poisons/chemotherapy is about the worst thing you can do to a cancer patient. This is of course totally against todays medical science, but rest assured they lie to us about this as well.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ether is basically rewriting physics. There is a God force around us. And yes you are right about all of that, try this. There used to be a food optimal for human health, able to make us live hundreds of years. Making our bodies perfect when we eat it, it restricts our muscles and then lets them go because it&#39;s such a strong food compared to what we&#39;re used to. The <a href="http://www.express.co.uk/news/science/639279/SCIENTISTS-discover-invisible-alien-entities-spying-on-us-on-Earth">Aliens</a> destroyed all of the food.</p>

<p>Now we&#39;re literally slaves. Who the fuck knows what to do but I want to get the F outta here. All of the ground is just garbage, it rips all the nutrients out of the food as it&#39;s growing. It used to give food extra nutrients, now it literally takes them all out.</p>

<p>Everything is fucked, the earth, who the fuck knows what the shape is, but there are underground cities. There is so much technology hidden away from us. Everything is backwards, who knows what to even do. I want to get the F outta here. I want to go somewhere where the good food is, I want peace, I want love, I got none of that shit. We are being used as billions of slaves. Humans have very resilient bodies, the proof is that fasting and eating herbal supplements literally defeats cancer. NOT EATING KILLS CANCER. That&#39;s how fucked our planet is. Go down the rabbit hole don&#39;t trust anyone. I wish Bible prophecy was coming true but to be 100% it won&#39;t. They are going to put our planet on lock down. These entities are all around us, EVERYWHERE. They are floating, taking pictures, laughing at the idiots, we are basically their entertainment I&#39;d say.</p>

<p>The master key is unlocking your inner spirit. They are probably going to use me for something, or I hope they just let me go. I don&#39;t even know, but &quot;Lucifer&quot; is the most enlightened. Lucifer is a real person in control of all this, no one knows who it is and don&#39;t even try to get him because as I said the alien entities are everywhere. I used to have hope that the new age would begin, but now I don&#39;t even know what to believe. Maybe they will transfer all the good souls into a new reality and leave all the idiots in this reality, to be used as slaves for all eternity basically. </p>

<p>Look at the world backwards everything is messed up. </p>

<p>That guy knew it all. If you read the post, it&#39;s gone now.</p>

<p>Follow your intuition we all have a 6th sense our minds are like a radio. Follow the truth. I can&#39;t help you anymore than I just did, good luck.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You don&#39;t think the bible will come true? I mean a bunch of things are happening. Your recent comments I saw it seemed like you were very positive about this all and you even mentioned how the bible is basically predicting things.. It gave me hope but now I&#39;m a bit worried.. I want out too. I really don&#39;t know what to do or what way to go. Like if shit is going to happen I need to prepare but I don&#39;t want to look like a fuckimg idiot if nothing happens.. I just hope a good entities help... </p>

    <div class="md"><p>:( well if we &#39;die&#39; or something maybe we, our soul, will goto somewhere where we belong?Just make sure we don&#39;t die of cancer or something I think maybe they want people to die like that because it&#39;s easier to harvest the energy or something.. No proof just an assumption. I mean if I was dying of cancer and doped on liquid not phone id probably be giving off negative energy and sadness... Everyone around is sad.. Negative energy times 20! </p>
