        <p><span class="badge badge-primary">71</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;2016-10-05 by <a class="author" href="../../../../../../../../user/MKULTRAserialkillers.html">MKULTRAserialkillers</a></p>
        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I was browsing r/serialkillers and noticed a <a href="https://i.redd.it/qjg5vpd6slpx.png">newspaper headline about Ted Bundy catching a purse snatcher.</a> That&#39;s bizarre enough in of itself, but what really caught my eye was the blurb about Bundy working for the Seattle Crime Prevention Advisory Committee.</p>

<p>Let&#39;s not forget he was also a paid campaign staffer for his state Republican party and comes from <a href="http://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/bloodlines/bundy.htm">a very influential and well connected family.</a> He also worked on Nelson Rockefeller&#39;s presidential campaign.</p>

<p>We&#39;ve seen <em>numerous</em> cases of serial killers working with the police prior to capture, from John Wayne Gacy to Bob Berdella. One might be inclined to say &#39;Of course, they&#39;re sociopaths.&quot;</p>

<p>I submit that they&#39;re part of something larger. Trauma based mind control and human trafficking go hand in hand- especially when you consider how intelligence agencies use these networks for assassins, blackmail and filthy lucre. See: <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/20t0ks/original_content_the_franklin_scandal_an_expos%C3%A9/?ref=search_posts">Craig Spence, The Franklin scandal, etc.</a></p>

<p>Later in life, Ted Bundy converted to Mormonism. This makes sense as Bundy had spent time killing in Utah. The Mormon Church has connections to these things- there are around 100,000 practising polygamists in the US according to author Jon Krakaur. Many of these people marry children, and use the polygamist angle to traffic girls and women. They use religious excuses to operate outside of the law.</p>

<p>See:<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warren_Jeffs">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warren_Jeffs</a></p>

<p>If you look at Mormon holy sites, you&#39;ll find <a href="http://vigilantcitizen.com/sinistersites/sinister-sites-temple-square-utah/">profuse Satanic iconography and anti-christian themes</a></p>

<p>So Ted Bundy was a Morman... That alone would not be too noteworthy if it weren&#39;t for his odd letters to would-be Reagan assassin John Hinckley Jr. </p>

<p>He drops a lot of strange language that refers to Monarch mind control- references to butterflies, women, and control. They also seems to be speaking in some sort of code- many letters from Hinckley references a film, and all of Bundy&#39;s responses contains the phrase &quot;the haunting score&quot; in reference to all these films being discussed.</p>

<p>On a side note, taken at face value they are rather amusing as they bicker over who&#39;s cooler, has a better wife, and politics. Ted Bundy&#39;s actually a pretty funny dude when he wants to be.</p>

<p>I&#39;ll admit, perhaps the odd repetition of the phrase &quot;haunting score&quot; is some sort of subtle brag about BUNDY&#39;S &quot;haunting score.&quot;</p>

<p>Here are the letters. The site is run by a Satanist.
<a href="http://www.sickofyourcrap.com/tedbundy-johnhinckley-letters/">http://www.sickofyourcrap.com/tedbundy-johnhinckley-letters/</a></p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4JepFcuZVuo">The Son Of Sam murderer David Berkowitz (who was also pen pals with Bundy) told author Maury Terrry that he worked with a Satanic cult (the OTO) to slaughter people</a> and committed most <em>but not every</em> murder- he claims he covered for accomplices on a few of the deaths. There is a lot of evidence indicating he wasn&#39;t lying.</p>

<p>To sum it up, Ted Bundy had connections with human trafficking, satanism, assassins, and mind control. And Mormons. And politicians. And cops.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>i try to keep an agnostic view of such things, and I like to consider all viewpoints.  I&#39;m going with the angle I believe the facts lead to. Although I respect  the work of people going with that theory i don&#39;t believe it&#39;s an across-the-board thing with these cases. i think many of these serial killers served other purposes and just shut their mouths about the drugrunning, human trafficking, and assasination stuff- thereby turning from gangsters and hitmen to serial killers with no motive beyond &quot;doing what they do.&quot; Then the media jumps on these cases and the serve a Gladio-type purpose- to frighten the masses into the loving arms of authoritarian control.</p>

<p>Very odd that Bundy shares the exact same bizarre family story as Jack Nicholson&#39;s though!</p>

<p><strong>In his mid-twenties Ted found out that the girl he had known as big sister his whole life was actually his mother, and that Mom and Dad were really his grandparents. He discovered this on his own by researching his birth records; nobody in his family had ever told him</strong></p>

<p>I&#39;m on the fence about some of those cases. Manson&#39;s case seems very hoaxy and a few others. </p>

<p>Hell, one could even view some of my evidence as fitting that framework, don&#39;t you think? </p>

<p>Yes, one could. I think an agnostic view here is a good one. There is a lot of evidence pointing to some kind of underground network of child trafficking and kiddie porn, as well as satanic ritual abuse and trauma-based mind control. I think the people running the child trafficking and kiddie porn rings (if true) could just be in it for the money. As for the ritual abuse and MK-ultra, it could very well be. I was very much a believer until I got wise to all the hoaxes. Now I just don&#39;t know. But it would be a good way to create a bunch of compliant slaves to do your dirty work and take the blame all the same, even if the assassinations and serial murders, etc. are actually hoaxed. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>These things to serve a political purpose- there&#39;s a practice called &quot;sanctifying&quot; in the intelligence community. It&#39;s where they find/create blackmail material on influential people, often politicians. </p>

<p>Operation Midnight Climax, Craig Spence, who was funded and supported by the CIA in his activities, Jeffrey Epstein (likely IMO) all work towards this purpose.</p>

<p>The poster child for Monarch mind control is Marilyn Manroe. She was sleeping with ALL the influential married men- JFK and his brother Robert, mobster Sam Giancana, etc.</p>

<p>When she died and her home was sold, the couple that bought it found extensive bugging equipment and 2 way mirrors and such. It cost them $100,000 to remove- and this was many decades ago!</p>

<p>I believe she was a tool used to &quot;sanctify&quot; influential people..</p>

<p>As for the SRA angle, Look at the False Memory Syndrome Foundation- they are the ones responsible for spreading the &quot;satanic panic&quot; meme... which is weird- they had all been accused of being pedos and many had links to MK-Ultra, often being direct participants. A very sketchy group. Their Wiki isn&#39;t all that sympathetic to them last i looked:<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/False_Memory_Syndrome_Foundation">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/False_Memory_Syndrome_Foundation</a></p>

<p>But for a full rundown, Whale.to has a great breakdown of every single member and their crimes and creepy connections:<a href="http://whale.to/c/falsememory.html">http://whale.to/c/falsememory.html</a>
Which is something the WIKI page largely glosses over. These hatchetpeople were courted by the press and taken very seriously, despite their affiliations.</p>

<p>Why would such a bizarre group change the narrative so thoroughly that even diehard conspiracy theorists often talk down about the &quot;satanic panic.&quot;</p>

<p>I believe Dr. Persinger (supposedly a head scientist in OPERATION SLEEPING BEAUTY) is a member. He is responsible for a device called &quot;The God Helmet&quot; that can simulate meeting God, extraterrestrials, out of body experiences, or just flood the brain with chemicals like heroin does. Yet, here he is, discrediting people who claim to have had such &quot;impossible&quot; experiences- there&#39;s no gov&#39;t funded black projects going on! People are misremembering! It&#39;s a hoax. We&#39;ve got a whole panel of experts who agree!</p>

<p>Check out the bizarre section of her wiki I provided. She&#39;s been involved in many, many public trials. Fuckjit, I&#39;ll copypaste-</p>

<p><strong>Notable cases she has been involved in due to her expertise include the McMartin preschool trial, O.J.

<p>Yes, the blackmail angle, I had forgotten about that. Definitely play a role. I remember reading a theory on the rigorous intuition blog some years ago that Reagan, who had been a liberal Democrat in the 40s, went to a Hollywood party with underage &#39;MKUltra&#39; betas programmed for sex. Even if he didn&#39;t indulge, just taking pictures of him around that scene would be enough. I know they say this is what the CIA does with foreign diplomats. I suppose it could be true and another purpose behind all of this. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, not in the classic sense of the term. From Urban Dictionary:</p>

<p><strong>A controlled opposition is a protest movement that is actually being led by government agents. Nearly all governments in history have employed this technique to trick and subdue their adversaries. Notably Vladimir Lenin who said &#39;&#39;The best way to control the opposition is to lead it ourselves.&quot;</strong></p>

<p><em>Count Mirabeau was part of the controlled opposition, because although everyone thought he was supporting the revolution, in reality he supported the monarchy and was a personal friend of the king. He was a government agent.</em></p>

<p>I don&#39;t know if this adds any evidence or not. They&#39;ve got some person who has built a career on showing how faulty people&#39;s memories are. She seems to have played a role in hoaxed events. But her research would also be relevant if you wanted to discredit MKULTRA/child abuse victims (if such are even real). So I don&#39;t know if it adds evidence one way or another... what do you think?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh man, I... don&#39;t know. I feel that this leans towards your camp&#39;s theories. or maybe it&#39;s a mix of both of ours?</p>

<p>I am conflicted. This requires further research. Maybe you or Miles can lend a hand? I&#39;m not exaggerating when I say that y&#39;alls research far exceeds anything in my competence. </p>

<p>Interesting that she orbited close to you- can this be exploited? On the other hand, it honestly may be dangerous considering your proximity and profession.</p>

<p>She may be a catch-all agent- there for both hoaxes and defense of actual conspiracies. Other FMSF members have been involved in obvious hoaxes like the SLA...<a href="https://isgp-studies.com/FMSF_freaks">https://isgp-studies.com/FMSF_freaks</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>I cannot speak for Miles. He goes his own way but you could put together a coherent e-mail asking him his opinion about the MKULTRA and false memory syndrome and send it to him. He might answer you. </p>

<p>As for me, I currently don&#39;t have the time, but I will consider giving it more attention and thought when I do. I think the question of whether MKULTRA and all the stuff that swirls around it is just a hoax (or what elements of it are just blowing smoke) is an interesting and important one. Not sure it&#39;s a question we can even really answer.  </p>

<p>My career eventually took me on a path far away from Loftus, so she&#39;s not anywhere near any of my social circles nowadays. </p>

I won&#39;t do that. Through r/conspiracy I have access to others- my post generated enough group knowledge to fill in many gaps in my theories.</p>

<p>I&#39;m  just going to crowdsource this MF&#39;er.</p>

<p>Anyway, I&#39;m not around her now nor was I ever. I was offered a job in her department, which I declined. She was not around then and I was told that she was rarely around, mainly due to all her expert witness testimony and demand as a speaker, etc. She is considered an academic super star. </p>

For now, I wanted to ask if anyone thinks that the links to satanism may be used to cover up the real source of the trouble (ie mind control research). Such that, if someone started to notice connections, they could mistakenly think that the link is Satan/devil worship and not something that is just as sinister but not as easily dismissed as satanism. </p>

<p>Also, I haven&#39;t seen it mentioned yet, but many cults that have sprung up since the 1950&#39;s are also related.</p>

<p>Like you said there have been SEVERAL mk associated cults, Jonestown is a well known one and there are some relevant wikileaks on it too. </p>

<p>&quot;psychic driving&quot; was the next step beyond the cults and there is quite a bit of documentation on the experiments done in Canada since there were successful lawsuits. </p>

<p>People think &quot;mind control&quot; research consisted of watching people take a single LSD dose like in buzzfeed article but it&#39;s more like solitary confinement with 20xLSD dose every day for 3 or more weeks, oh right and this was done to children. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I just found out about Dr. Elizabeth Loftus of the false Memory Syndrome foundation-, who provided &#39;expert testimony&quot; for ted Bundy- check out this section of her wiki:</p>

<p><strong>Notable cases she has been involved in due to her expertise include the McMartin preschool trial, O.J. Simpson, the trials of mass murderers Ted Bundy, Willie Mak, and Angelo Bueno, the Abscam cases, the trial of Oliver North, the trial of the officers accused in the Rodney King beating, the trial of the Menendez brothers, the Bosnian War trials in the Hague, the Oklahoma City bombing case, and litigation involving Michael Jackson, Martha Stewart, Lewis &quot;Scooter&quot; Libby and the Duke University Lacrosse team.[7][8][10][11][15]</strong>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t know about McMartin as I&#39;ve only researched that one from the perspective that argues it was covered up and children actually were abused, but I think many/most of the others were managed events, either manufactured entirely by intelligence or guided along to the desired result.</p>

<p>Mass murderers in general, AKA serial killers, are in my mind an intel creation meant to cause fear and chaos, with maybe a couple of &quot;real&quot; exceptions (though I actually haven&#39;t found any).  The OJ trial was absurd for many reasons once you start reading the details.  Oklahoma City bombing likewise.  Rodney King&#39;s beating was on every news channel and newspaper around the country for weeks or months at a time, and anything that gets <em>that much</em> airtime from the mainstream is automatically suspect.  Think of all the other fishy events that have gotten airtime like that: 9/11, Sandy Hook, Boston Bombing, Scopes Monkey Trial, etc., etc.</p>

<p>So yeah, Dr. Liz is most likely a spook or a spook asset, and these events most likely involve hidden actors/agents from the CIA or similar agencies.  At least that would be my guess.  You notice a lot of the same judges, lawyers, reporters, interviewers, jails, towns, etc. involved in all of these events, so that&#39;s always one clue to look out for.</p>

<p>The family of the man charged with trying to assassinate President Reagan is acquainted with the family of Vice President George Bush and had made large contributions to his political campaign, the Houston Post reported today</p>

<p>The newspaper said in a copyright story, Scott Hinckley, brother of John W. Hinckley Jr., who allegedly shot Reagan, was to have dined tonight in Denver at the home of Neil Bush, one of the vice president&#39;s sons.</p>

<p>The newspaper said it was unable to reach Scott Hinckley, vice president of his father&#39;s Denver-based firm, Vanderbilt Energy Corp., for comment. Neil Bush lives in Denver, where he works for Standard Oil Co. of Indiana.</p>

<p>In 1978, Neil served as campaign manager for his brother, George W. Bush, the vice president&#39;s oldest son, who made an unsuccessful bid for Congress. Neil lived in Lubbock throughout much of 1978, where John Hinckley lived from 1974 through 1980.</p>

<p>On Monday, Neil Bush said he did not know if he had ever met 25-year-old John Hinckley.</p>

<p>From what I know and I&#39;ve heard, they (the Hinckleys) are a very nice family and have given a lot of money to the Bush campaign.&quot;
SHARON BUSH
&quot;I have no idea,&quot; he said. &quot;I don&#39;t recognize any pictures of him. I just wish I could see a better picture of him.</p>

<p>Sharon Bush, Neil&#39;s wife, said Scott Hinckley was coming to their house as a date of a girl friend of hers.  &quot;I don&#39;t even know the brother. From what I know and I&#39;ve heard, they (the Hinckleys) are a very nice family and have given a lot of money to the Bush campaign. I understand he was just the renegade brother in the family. They must feel awful,&quot; she said.</p>

<p>The dinner was canceled, she added.   George W. Bush said he was unsure whether he had met John W. Hinckley.</p>

<p>You are on to something huge here MKUsk, glad someone else finally said something about the Mormon situation.  Most Mormons are absolutely clueless about the origin and activities of the church.  But the higher ups I imagine are as fucked as Scientology&#39;s leaders.  Its fair to compare the two, since they are both pseudognostic useful idiot cult spin offs from freemasonry . </p>

<p>The import of this is that the in the intellugence community, the Mormon affiliation represents a majority.

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks, man:) I feel like there&#39;s a piece of this puzzle I&#39;m overlooking though and it&#39;s bugging me... </p>

<p>As for the Moroni&#39;s, It&#39;s a slow realization that&#39;s been a long time coming. This may sound silly but I had some Mormon friends who I really liked, and for years I let that cloud my judgement on the matter... but they weren&#39;t Fundamentalist and were very low level. One thing about the LDS I find amusing is that the most Republican county in the most republican state (Utah) leads the country in welfare donations because of all the &quot;single mothers&quot; who are actually married in plural situations. Mormans encourage this sort of thing- they call it &quot;bleeding the beast.&quot;</p>

<p>Hoffman, I&#39;d not heard of him until now- his stuff looks fascinating. I want a copy of his book! He addresses the Son Of Sam case too, I&#39;d love to see what he has to say on it. After looking him up it seems he&#39;s accrued quite a bit of derision and kickback from the <em>cough</em> skeptics with little real reason behind it. That&#39;s a bit of negative confirmation for me, because what I just <em>read</em> of his was very intelligent.</p>

<p>Hoffman&#39;s talk <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKiTIA5aHXg">&quot;the Occult Philosophy&quot;</a> on youtube is amazing.  I hate the background btw, it makes me dizzy so I minmized the window.</p>

<p>Here is a very good <a href="http://mediamonarchy.com/2013/03/secret-societies-and-psychologica/">article at Media Monarchy</a> about Hoffman.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>DUDE- curiosity36 provided that last annoying puzzle piece I was missing, and it&#39;s implications are huge IMO- Dr. Elizabeth Loftus of the False Memory Syndrome Foundation provided &quot;expert testimony&quot; in favor of Ted Bundy at his trial. Check out this section of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elizabeth_Loftus#Expert_testimony">her wiki</a></p>

<p><strong>Notable cases she has been involved in due to her expertise include the McMartin preschool trial, O.J. Simpson, the trials of mass murderers Ted Bundy, Willie Mak, and Angelo Bueno, the Abscam cases, the trial of Oliver North, the trial of the officers accused in the Rodney King beating, the trial of the Menendez brothers, the Bosnian War trials in the Hague, the Oklahoma City bombing case, and litigation involving Michael Jackson, Martha Stewart, Lewis &quot;Scooter&quot; Libby and the Duke University Lacrosse team.[7][8][10][11][15]</strong></p>

<p>What do all those connections mean? i think you know.</p>

<p>Also I found a great letter between Aldous Huxley and timothy Leary that is very revealing. I will make another post about it soon,  make it long and well sourced. Sometimes the search for truth can be a bit like gambling... do you know what I mean? When you find those elusive connections and evidence, finally.</p>

I read some documents obtained through the FOIA wherein the CIA discussed having to keep their mind control ops secret from the vast majority of even trusted CIA agents- taking over people&#39;s souls is such an affront to humanity that it begs whistleblowers.

    <div class="md"><p>Well, not in the classic sense of the term. From Urban Dictionary:</p>

<p><strong>A controlled opposition is a protest movement that is actually being led by government agents. Nearly all governments in history have employed this technique to trick and subdue their adversaries. Notably Vladimir Lenin who said &#39;&#39;The best way to control the opposition is to lead it ourselves.&quot;</strong></p>

<p><em>Count Mirabeau was part of the controlled opposition, because although everyone thought he was supporting the revolution, in reality he supported the monarchy and was a personal friend of the king. He was a government agent.</em></p>

<p>Oh and interestig read about The Fool Card BTW CR:)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh man, I... don&#39;t know. I feel that this leans towards your camp&#39;s theories. or maybe it&#39;s a mix of both of ours?</p>

<p>I am conflicted. This requires further research. Maybe you or Miles can lend a hand? I&#39;m not exaggerating when I say that y&#39;alls research far exceeds anything in my competence. </p>

<p>Interesting that she orbited close to you- can this be exploited? On the other hand, it honestly may be dangerous considering your proximity and profession.</p>

<p>She may be a catch-all agent- there for both hoaxes and defense of actual conspiracies. Other FMSF members have been involved in obvious hoaxes like the SLA...<a href="https://isgp-studies.com/FMSF_freaks">https://isgp-studies.com/FMSF_freaks</a></p>
