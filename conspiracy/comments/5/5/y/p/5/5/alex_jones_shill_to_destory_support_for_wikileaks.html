        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>From yesterdays live cast on info wars Alex Jones and Info Wars have been slating WikiLeaks on not leaking more stuff that day to destory hillary. This came across to me as childish and very naieve. Alex Jones has never given 1 though about Julian&#39;s detainment or what WikiLeaks has been going through.</p>

<p>With InfoWars you can donate in dollars and buy items from the store. WikiLeaks had all banks embargo the organisation such that no donations in normal currency&#39;s can be made. Yes they have a store but its much smaller and yes they have donations now but in bitcoin and its still difficult for them.</p>

<p>Alex also believes they leak more in a year and leak more credible stuff. None of which are true when you truely think of the impact wikileaks has had on the world. Such as the Arab Spring. I believe Alex Jones has been bought off some time ago and has coincided by more heavy mentions of info wars and alex in main stream news.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yep. He has always existed for the sole purpose of creating an association between real conspiracies and real world incidents and his absurd conspiracy theories and his own brand of lunacy.</p>

<p>He made false claims about an october surprise when WikiLeaks were just having a conference for their ten year, then he acted like it was a personal attack on him when they didn&#39;t. If he would have shut his fat head for a few minutes he would have heard Assange say they were dropping the next leak soon and it was regarding the uS.</p>

<p>Never got that same vibe from Bill Cooper on the other hand. From listening to him talk about JFK Jr (after his murder/death) and the shit he was saying in 2001 right before 9/11 is prophetic as fuck. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I get where you&#39;re coming from but </p>

<p>A) <em>They</em> don&#39;t care which tid-bits he releases when, they want to kill the guy anyway. It&#39;s not dependent on him leaking this email or that email at a certain time. </p>

<p>B) He switched it to a live stream, understandable. Then he didn&#39;t release anything. A sniper can&#39;t shoot him inside an embassy, and the US isn&#39;t going to drone an embassy. So why didn&#39;t he release anything?</p>

<p>C) If he fears for his life because of the Clintons, releasing info on them is one way of mitigating those dangers. Keeping it to himself is not... i.e. drawing attention to the fact they want to kill him does not make it any easier for them to kill him.</p>

<p>Just my thoughts. All seems like a charade.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Julian is my hero to be honest.  He has sacraficed himself so severly for the benifit of everyone. I understand where your comming from but <em>never</em> forget that in 10 years wikileaks has <em>never</em> got it wrong. This is where the time delay hits in.</p>

<p>This is important because if any time mistake is to occur remember wikileaks repulation will be destroyed overnight.</p>

<p>I beleive there is also some political joseling i think. Remember julian has been unable to see his kids in the whole time since the rape allegation that turned out to be pure lies even the people alleging it dont anymore. This man wants freedom and to have a life back. Alex Jones has never had any freedom taken away.</p>
