        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>It doesn&#39;t matter where you&#39;re from or what you believe, this post is for you. </p>

<p>Not just here on this forum of brilliant minds, but also in other corners of the Internet where people gather to share truth, I am beginning to see a new surge in posts expressing utter sorrow, frustration and long-lasting depression by those that have learned some of the more disturbing truths of our world. I wanted to share a more positive perspective with all of you in the hope that I can lift a few chins today and dry a few tears, other than my own.</p>

<p>First, it&#39;s OK to be upset. It&#39;s human to feel overwhelming emotional trauma when you understand and, dare I say, feel, the hundreds of millions of innocent people taken from this world in agony and suffering, all because of a wealthy philanthropist&#39;s fantastical and selfish desires. The prayers of innocents weren&#39;t answered, they weren&#39;t aware of what was really going on, no, they were simply, painfully stripped from this existence. Primarily I&#39;m thinking now of the children in Aleppo, those that cried out in the darkness only to fall silent as they slipped from life. Just typing this makes me shake in fury for all of them. It&#39;s human to feel these emotions and to let them penetrate your being, but if you want to survive, and you should, then you also NEED TO DETACH.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“I give myself a good cry if I need it. But then I concentrate on the good things still in my life. I don&#39;t allow myself any more self-pity than that. A little each every morning, a few tears, and that&#39;s all.”
― Mitch Albom, Tuesdays with Morrie </p>
</blockquote>

<p>What matters is that you are here and you&#39;ve asked some of the hardest questions in life. You represent GOOD people out there from ALL walks of life wanting to know the truth, and in most cases, wanting peace, prosperity, and an end to the bloody and illegal wars ravaging nations all over the world. You want your countryman&#39;s rights back, you want the right to national sovereignty and independence back, or maybe you just want to be left alone with your loved ones in peace to enjoy all the good things that life has to offer. There&#39;s nothing wrong with any of these goals and I hope some of them you can identify with.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve moved around the US and lived abroad off and on for several years, and there&#39;s one, giant slap-in-the-face observation I want to remark upon: <strong>Most people are just GOOD</strong>. They WILL stop what they&#39;re doing to help you, they WILL give you a smile and wave back even if they don&#39;t know your language, give directions to those who are lost, help push your car out of a snowy embankment, I can go on and on with even bigger acts of selfless kindness, but the point is there is just so much GOOD in this world that shouldn&#39;t be overlooked and tossed to the side simply because of a few, evil individuals in seats of power.</p>

<p>There are thousands of videos like this that show you all the wonderful things people do out of pure reaction. They aren&#39;t considering their own safety or thinking of moral implications, they selflessly jump to help:
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-dRWZbcMQM">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-dRWZbcMQM</a></p>

<p>So what separates us from &quot;the powers that be&quot;? EVERYTHING. The absurdly wealthy <em>creatures</em> in control of geopolitics do not live in the real world. They were born into a world without physical hard work, without compassion and without EMPATHY. It is a distorted, artificial world. They are subhuman, delusional creatures and they will never feel the beautiful human emotions that you and I do. Do not ever wonder what &quot;they&quot; think about when they commit an action, for they do not think like real human beings. Know this,<br/>
<strong>ALL OF YOU ARE BETTER THAN THEM!</strong><br/>
You&#39;re all kings in the world of humanity because you experience the fullness of life, both the good and the bad, that these creatures in power do not. They are not living real lives with real emotions and real problems. </p>

<p><a href="https://psmag.com/five-studies-the-psychology-of-the-ultra-rich-according-to-the-research-fffab386ae6f#.wixjfon0w">https://psmag.com/five-studies-the-psychology-of-the-ultra-rich-according-to-the-research-fffab386ae6f#.wixjfon0w</a></p>

<p>You&#39;ve stepped forward from the masses and thrown off the chains of lies and propaganda to ask &quot;why?&quot; and to maybe make things better. Very few individuals in the history of our species have been able to do this. The Internet is still brand new in the large scheme of things and you&#39;ve taken it upon yourself to learn more about what&#39;s going on. I commend you all, but I also ask that you not lose sight of the fact that you <strong>DO</strong> already live in the real world, where real emotions and real relationships are formed. There isn&#39;t more truth and happiness to be found in wealth or power, there is <strong>LESS</strong>.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I appreciate the sentiment. I&#39;m not exactly an avid contributor here, finding it difficult to come to reliable sources any faster than anyone else, and so generally I tend to think about contributing posts like this, but don&#39;t. I appreciate you taking the time on behalf of myself, and perhaps others that share this understanding and optimism, whom decline to do so for whatever reason.</p>

<p>I find myself typically at a bit of an impasse, where on one hand I acknowledge that posting as you are is a nonzero quantity of effort with a nonzero potential to contribute positively. On the other hand, I should like to be able to contribute something more tangible. That is to say; is there something more constructive that could be done? I believe there must be, however I know not what it is, nor were I able to conceive of what it might be would I have any faith that it could not be co-opted or corrupted, considering what I think the bulk of us know about the susceptibility for media such as Reddit to be succumb to such tactics. With those doubts (and perhaps some cowardice) I remain in a less-than-productive state.</p>

<p>As far as Reddit (and r/conspiracy) is concerned, there is little to no organisation of information. The same data is reposted again and again because the design of the website is - in the absence of significant effort - such that information is fleeting. We all might know what we know about the wealthy (e.g.), but actual archived evidences are not tethered to this subreddit. I find this akin to a person trying to learn and retain knowledge without long-term memory capability. Of course, some would say that this place is but an introductory forum to the world of possible conspiracies, but that does not suggest there shouldn&#39;t/couldn&#39;t be a link to a forum that is for the more initiated. Perhaps there is and I&#39;m missing it? Is there even a way to have certainty in the information gathered? Are websites themselves too transient to rely upon for archival purposes? What are the alternatives?</p>

<p>TL;DR: Thanks for sharing your thoughts and feelings on the matter. Do you (or anyone else) feel that it might be time for some of us to find a more constructive means for actively fostering a more reliable collection of evidences of misdeeds, and/or effective actions? Is there a place like that already? (I know I&#39;m not the first person to seeks such goals.)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was living interstate for three years, and was among people; with what I was seeing on the news and everything else, it got to the point where I no longer wanted to live, although Reddit also had a lot to do with that.</p>

<p>Now I&#39;m back at my mother&#39;s, and in a given 24 hour period, I will leave my bedroom either to use the bathroom or go to the front door to get pizza when it is delivered.  As pathetic as it might also sound, the single main thing I love about living like this, is that <strong><em>I never see a single mobile phone.</em></strong>  For a couple of weeks I was literally able to forget that they existed, before seeing something online that reminded me again.</p>

<p>There are two fundamental reasons why, at least until November when I go north again, I am not going outside.</p>

<p>a}  <strong><em>I live on a planet that is ruled by psychopaths.</em></strong>  </p>

<p>Non-psychopathic authority, of any form, whether local, governmental, or coorporate, is the exception rather than the rule.  I was taught this at an extremely young age, and I virtually never encounter anyone in authority now, where it is not the case.</p>

<p>b}  <strong><em>Society consists of very little other than a collection of different special interest groups, all of whom are competing for exclusive dominion over said society, at everyone else&#39;s expense.</em></strong></p>

<p>Feminism.  LGBT.  Men&#39;s Rights.  Ethnic minority groups.  White supremacy.  Islam.  Christianity.  Atheism.  Transhumanism.  Fascist governments.  It does not matter who they are; they <strong><em>all</em></strong> want you to believe that <strong><em>their</em></strong> way, and their way <strong><em>alone</em></strong> is right, and everyone else is wrong, and they are unwilling to tolerate the very <strong><em>existence</em></strong> of anyone who does not think or see the world in the same way they do.</p>

<p>I want the psychopaths gone, and I want the special interest groups gone; but realistically speaking, that is not going to happen.  If I have to live with that, then I will; but I will not do so where I am immediately visible to them, or them to me.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You are right. The only thing I would like to add is that the self actualized mind is pure love regardless of who it is. These elites are distorted beyond imagination and is they have gone mad. My faith in humanity is solid. All we have to do is put in some elbow grease in our immediate vicinity and see all people as equals. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Good read. I would also like to add that humanity has been conditioned to dwell on the negative.  </p>

<p>The full range of empathy is not experienced by the elite and you just have to observe the candidates to see how shallow they both are terms of what love even is. Love of course is not a topic of discussion, negative things are and when they attempt to seem empathetic it&#39;s not genuine.</p>

<p>So you see the conditioning of dwelling on the negative is present in our leaders, even more so than ourselves. Only we look to our leaders and they propagate negativity. But it&#39;s a loop really, they reflect our negativity and we reflect theirs.</p>

<p>I would suggest methods to alter that conditioning are similar to the op. The collective will just continue down this path of separation if the cycle is not ended.</p>

<p>So, every channel on tv will show you an alternative to a negative thing. Every one wants to sell you the alternative to a negative. And that is because we fear a negative, and that is where we end up dwelling and constantly putting our attention upon. When we interact it&#39;s usually to discuss what&#39;s wrong. We have been conditioned to do this.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>To me you were close, except we&#39;re not better than anyone. We&#39;re all the same. God (or, the divine) is in all of us. There are no evil people, only manifestations of darkness in an inherently pure being. </p>

<p>There&#39;s another study about the psychology of wealth. They took random people--like you and I--to play a game of Monopoly. Some got more money at the outset, for no reason. Those that got more money showed less empathy and developed ruthlessness as the game went on. But everyone at the top isn&#39;t a monster incapable of feeling compassion. They do, but only for a select few as a defense mechanism to safeguard what they falsely feel is important: money and power. They&#39;re not subhuman.</p>

<p>To hate &quot;them&quot; is to hate ourselves. This isn&#39;t the same as buying into their ideology. It&#39;s best to move away from it. Doing so is the single best thing that reduces any power they hold, because it&#39;s contingent on our acquiescence, our energy.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks!! Love the part where you say there are a lot of Good people out there!! The media wants us to believe everyone is out to kill, rape, kidnap and steal from us. And like you say, I don&#39;t see this at all, if we just pull off the blinders and break through the barriers, we can all see deep down most of us all want the same thing. </p>
