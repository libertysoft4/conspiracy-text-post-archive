        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>We need some help with various technical aspects of the page so can anyone who can prove their worth put their name and credentials forward to this request. </p>

<p>This request is essentially CSS and automod/ bot focus help, there is no need for any other moderation duties for the selected person. </p>

<p>The current moderation team are looking to add someone who is savvy with the mentioned skills and who is able to work with us to improve certain aspects of the layout and potential automod features for the community. </p>

<p>Anyone who is successful with their application/interest will receive some complimentary biscuits. </p>

<p>Please keep it civil. </p>

<p>Edit:</p>

<p>There seems to be some confusion about the nature of the request here so i&#39;ll try to clarify a bit.</p>

<p>The moderation team are looking to update the page layout and to lighten the overall theme, there is no need for the page to look so dark now and we feel that a lighter look is needed. CSS changes happen from time to time and at the moment we do not have a dedicated moderator who can help out with this. </p>

<p>We also need help with the automod for a number of reasons, non of them are to do with censorship. The automod is a valuable tool and one we should try to implement for the communities benefit. </p>

<p>Essentially we are going to look to bring back the monthly documentary/film post and also possibly a weekly open discussion thread in a similar vein to r/soccer&#39;s &#39;free talk friday&#39; posts. </p>

<p>The automoderator is the perfect way of going about this. It saves the Human mods time and also makes sure we have consistency with such posts, something that we have lacked in the past. </p>

<p>I hope this clarifies the request for all of you. </p>

<p>On a final note, can we all concentrate on actually offering help, rather than pick on other users on this thread. </p>

<p><em>edit</em> If we are changing the CSS of the sub, let&#39;s make it so vote counts on comments and posts aren&#39;t hidden for a period of time like on the rest of reddit.  Let&#39;s also get rid of those annoying bots that warn us against cross posting without the use of the silly np.  The black gov&#39;t agent theme of this site could be improved upon as well, or preferably changed.</p>

It&#39;s annoying, but overall protects us from being quarantined for brigading accusations. It&#39;s a courtesy/good measure move by the mods to the admins. Encouraging people to not brigade.

<li><p>Right now the AutoModerator&#39;s foremost role is censor breaking stories, before they become a front page eyesore, thereby embarrassing the rest of the forum. Surely the AutoModerator will remove the odd Facebook link or an all caps headline, but that is no longer the main purpose of the AutoModerator.</p></li>
<li><p>The Moderators and Administrators are still not addressing the BIGGEST PROBLEM on Reddit: Astroturfing, censorship and professional shilling operations.

<p>Tweaking the AutoModerator won&#39;t change any of that, it will only drown out more voices of decent, completing the transformation from free media platform to a fully integrated corporate owned mass media platform, controlled by the big money and the US intelligence community. </p>

<li>Nor can I violate rule §10 without getting hit by the ban hammer. Last time I wrote my uncensored opinion about your account activities (&quot;Mr. Flyyyyyyyytape&quot;), by calling you a bad name (&quot;honeypot&quot;), which apparently was a mortal offence, it must have left a deep scar on you soul, because I got myself a stark warning from a well known moderator (wink wink say no more say no more) - Another meaningless and useless shit stain on my wrap sheet of &quot;warnings&quot; and &quot;serious talks&quot; with the current moderator team.</li>

<p>You comment is demeaning, meaningless and meant to provoke me into a new violation. GFY. </p>

<p>When I write about something that gets censored or shill hammered into oblivion, it happens from time to time, I double down on my efforts. When I and some other people got banned, censored or treated with a ban from the moderator team, when we posted about the Snowden leaks - weeks before it went mainstream - we didn&#39;t back down, we just continued our pathetic little crusade for the truth.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>They are two separate things that the mods are asking someone to help with:</p>

<p><strong>CSS</strong> - Acronym for Cascading Style Sheets. In web programming, it&#39;s a language for adding styles to HTML elements on a web page. Anything from font (size/color/style) to positioning is usually done in CSS now, vs the Netscape days where &lt;font&gt; html tags and various other attributes were the norm.</p>

<p>Subreddits can have their own css styles, in which you might have already noticed that various subreddits have their own background colors/images, vote buttons, header images, etc.</p>

<p><strong>Automod</strong> - It&#39;s a tool in Reddit which does various autonomous tasks based on mod-defined rules. The rules are written using YAML syntax, and can do various things like flag/delete posts with inappropriate or unaccepted content, notify mods of suspicious posts or even simply make recurring posts.</p>

<p>For example, if a post were to be submitted in ALL CAPS (rule 6), the automod could remove it automatically without needing intervention from a real mod, thus freeing up the mods to do actual moderating.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t think we have to worry about blatant censorship from this subreddit. Automod, when done right, takes care of the mundane mod chores.</p>

<p>When done wrong, someone will usually post about it here when another subreddit seems to be blacklisting certain buzzwords or titles to push an agenda.</p>

<p>You&#39;re right, in a way. It&#39;s backwards that they need to make a rule for something that should be common sense. There are better options for showing inflection than using the caps-lock key.</p>

<p>This isn&#39;t exactly the right post to complain about the rules on. Perhaps you could submit a new post with your arguments for removing rule 6, although I suspect that would be a waste of time compared to all the <em>other, far more significant issues that plague us</em>.</p>

<p>I do have a question on the AutoMod features you want to implement. Right now, I generally respect the mod team here, and think you do a pretty decent job in light of the rampant vote manipulation and general disruption that goes on here. The decision to implement public mod logs is also great, as it gives a good amount of transparency to what mod actions you take.</p>

<p>If you implement more AutoMod rules than you already have, will you make these public? I do see the downside, as it would make it easier for bad actors to get around the rules, but it would make me more comfortable with the new rules. </p>

<p>As an aside, perusing the mod log, it looks like AutoMod is being used to shadowban some users at the sub level. A lot of comments appear to be removed by AutoMod that are not breaking rules. If you are using it for this purpose, do you feel that&#39;s justified? If not, is it just configured improperly or am I missing something?</p>

<p>Do you have some examples?  My guess is that you&#39;re seeing automod removing posts and comments from brand new accounts, which it&#39;s set to do to cut down on trolling.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, you know what, that seems to be what I was looking at last night, new accounts. </p>

<p>I think my broader question still stands, and I would like to see some dialogue between the mods and the community about what these new AutoMod rules you will be implementing will entail. I get not giving specifics that might compromise your efforts, but even the broad strokes would be helpful. Maybe even promises or pledges of what AM will <em>not</em> be used for. </p>

<p>I think this would be just as good for the mods as the community. <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> users are, shall we say, adversarial towards the mods. A lot of that is from trolls and disruptors, but I think a fair amount of it is just genuine truth-seekers who realize there&#39;s a lot of BS at reddit overall, and don&#39;t think it&#39;s beyond reason to suspect that this mod team is infiltrated to some degree. I know a couple of you fairly well (as far as one can internet strangers), yet I&#39;m still skeptical of the mod team as a whole. Anything you guys can do to add transparency to the process and assuage the concerns of the genuine skeptics will also help us, the core community, keep a limit on any drama that will surely arise. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I actually don&#39;t know what the new implementations are or what dong&#39;s ideas are, so as of now I can&#39;t say.  What I know is that there&#39;s been some contention among the mod team regarding titles being posted with sensationalist or click-baity headlines, or with an abundance of caps lock like &quot;BREAKING:&quot;.  So I&#39;m assuming that&#39;s what automod would be filtering out, maybe look for some % of caps lock and remove based on that.  Or remove anything that starts with the phrase &quot;BREAKING&quot;.  That&#39;s my guess, but I agree there should be a bit more transparency if/when we go ahead with it.</p>

<p>I&#39;ll provide some personally if none of the other mods plan to as soon as I know more.  We definitely don&#39;t shadowban users with automod though like some of the defaults do.</p>

<p>And I can certainly understand the feelings users have towards mods on reddit, I was a user of this sub long before I was a mod and I shared many of those same feelings.</p>

<p>What do you intend to implement with the automod?  Perhaps you should edit this OP with some more details for what you had in mind with all of this.  I don&#39;t think it&#39;s too crazy a request for the users to have a bit of clarity.</p>
