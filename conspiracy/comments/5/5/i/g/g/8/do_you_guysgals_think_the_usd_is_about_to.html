<p>A lot of people on reddit now are really, i guess impressionable is the word. They see that this opinion is mass upvoted and therefor the &quot;most popular&quot; opinion, and because of that, they consider it the most right. Then they believe it, repeat it, and argue for it.</p>

<p>if the elite are stock piling gold</p>

<p>Gold doesn&#39;t mean anything.  It&#39;s a fantasy.  Gold is a substance which, other than as a conductor, has virtually no practical use whatsoever.  Going forward, food and information are going to be the important commodities.  Gold as a unit of wealth is an anachronism, and it was never an intelligent idea to begin with.  Gold&#39;s value has always been exclusively symbolic.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>While I agree that food, and especially water, in addition to the means to protect yourself/family and supplies are invaluable for whatever length of time you believe these items will be necessary, it&#39;s naive at best to think that gold is worthless once things are reestablished. Fiat currencies are worthless, and while gold may not have a practical value(I disagree) nonetheless the intrinsic value and limited supply have historically made it a well documented valuable economic resource since at least Egyptian times. Basically, get what you need to survive first(at least 6 months, Ideally a couple years), and any left over money should be used to pay off your Mortgages, buy land and then perhaps 10-20% in Gold. Our current situation is about wealth preservation, very little money to be made for us little guys. Get rid of your stocks. Research Executive Order 6102 (Gold Confiscation of 1933) and see what the price of gold was for the 100 years before and what it was just 30 years after and is today. That said, I&#39;d say Brass,Copper and lead, in one neatly wrapped package(ammo) is more useful and will probably increase in value over the next decade/s. </p>

<p>Just make sure you don&#39;t blow your  6-12 months Emergency Funds planning for a collapse, and not having the resources if something happens before shtf, like a more realistic scenario of loosing you job. It&#39;s be great to have 1 year of food, water and ammo, but pretty shitty if your sleeping in your car with it.</p>

When you control the economical foundation of the world, you can&#39;t predict a failure so easily.

    <div class="md"><p>I doubt it.  One of the clever elements of American hegemony, is that in some respects at least, it is still too beneficial to some people to be dismantled completely.  The real issue is when the cost to benefit ratio of Pax Americana starts to lean unacceptably in the &quot;cost,&quot; direction.  I think we&#39;re definitely getting closer, but we&#39;re not quite there yet.</p>

<p>The other thing to understand is that the corporate world keeps experiencing setbacks as well, recently; bankers are finally starting to be criminally charged in some places.  So the system potentially still has a certain amount of life in it yet.  If there is sufficient reform, and the truly problematic individuals end up being jailed, then that will satisfy a lot of people.  Very few want to completely remove their faith in the status quo unless it becomes truly necessary, because if you do that, you then have to rebuild everything from the ground up, which is an enormous task.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, the dollar has always survived, despite resets. We had a gold-pinned dollar until &#39;34, then &quot;Federal Reserve Note&quot;, the Bretton Woods dollar, then Nixon&#39;s petrodollar. The PD was genius. Countries had to buy oil in USD so they had to keep a stock of them. Rather than trade their currency for them and get hammered on exchange rates, they shipped real goods into our country, showering us in excess &quot;stuff&quot; while the dollar&#39;s actual purchasing power dropped due to inflation and the mismanagement of treasury bond issuance. </p>

<p>Not exactly.  There have been multiple U.S. currency crises (including collapse of the Continental dollar) &amp; depreciations, and it&#39;s false to say that U.S. currency was always pinned to gold.</p>
