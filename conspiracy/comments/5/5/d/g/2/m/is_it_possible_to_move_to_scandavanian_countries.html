    <div class="md"><p>Anyone that says not to do it can go fuck themselves. Do what you want, go where you want. Challenge is not an excuse not to try. Just because one person fails doesnt mean you will. Im not American but i would probably consider moving too if i was you. American Oligarchs are instigating a war that its own people dont support. The whitehouse and CIA have been infiltrated and subverted and are currently converting America to a fascist police state while starting a third world war. To me American&#39;s need to be looking at themselves and saying &quot;Are we really letting this go on??&quot;</p>

<p>Seriously better now to get immigration status then have to get refugee status in a few years.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>For those of you who have attacked my advice, I feel I am giving some valuable input to a person who asked for such.</p>

<p>I can add to my comments:</p>

<p>2 of my children live in the EU - one in the UK, the other in Central Europe.</p>

<p>I lived 22 years in Europe and speak a number of European languages, still, it is not easy.</p>

<p>I know a LOT of expats, some have made fortunes and built good lives, others struggle not knowing why, others have returned to the USA.</p>

<p>I am in a group of 3 people who all returned/moved to the USA from Europe in the last year. We are all happier here and have more opportunity.</p>

<p>Like with all life decisions, use your head, not your heart. Plan and prepare - Good Luck whatever you decide.</p>

<p>Peace! :)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Changing your geography will change nothing. You will be even more of an outsider there than you are in your home country. If you are unhappy here, you will be unhappy there. Happiness does not come from geography - it comes from inside. Fix that first.</p>

<p>You don&#39;t speak the language.</p>

<p>You don&#39;t understand the culture.</p>

<p>You are an outsider with strange habits to them.</p>

<p>You have no contact network.</p>

<p>You have no job there.</p>

<p>You likely have no relevant job skills that will be in demand without the commensurate language skills which you will NEVER have as good as the locals.</p>

<p>I lived abroad for 22 years, but went prepared - still, it isn&#39;t easy. I came back to the USA now when jobs for expats dried up.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s not about happiness really. It&#39;s about NOT allowing my government to abuse me. If I let this happen, I am screwing my own self over. The one good thing is that I thrive is other cultures. Somehow diversity effects me well and brings out a lot of fun. </p>

<p>The only shitty part is that I have a business here. I would probably have to sell it to leave. </p>

<p>I&#39;m working to improve on a feeling of knowing that I live among the people who experience actual freedom (not slavery). </p>

<p>I&#39;ll be happy to help America steer into that direction but I need help. I can&#39;t do it alone. I&#39;m going to give it some time in hopes that Americans start moving. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you think your government abuses you here, Scandinavia is not the place for you as government there has a far greater role in your daily life than it does in the USA.</p>

<p>All government is a negative force. It takes money under threat of violence and imposes its will on the populace with it monopoly on legal force/violence.</p>

<p>You will pay more in taxes and be subject to more laws and hence, experience less freedom.</p>

<p>Have you been to Scandinavia?</p>

<p>Would your business work there?</p>

<p>I actually started a business in Europe and succeeded. Sold it to family members and they now employ tens of people some 25 years later.</p>

<p>One thing that helped me is knowing the expat life cycle - or the emotional roller coaster most expats go on.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Read my previous comments first - but if you still think you want to try, go for it. I just feel your reasons are wrong.</p>

<p>How to do it:</p>

<p>1.) Marry someone from there.</p>

<p>2.) If you have family from any European country (Italy, Poland, Ireland) - they often have laws that will allow you to get a passport from there. Once in any EU country, you have full rights to live, work, attend school anywhere else in the EU and Switzerland too! </p>

<p>3.) Learn the language, go on vacation there - an extended one. </p>

<p>If you do not have any in-demand job skills, you will be relegated to menial jobs done by foreigners with no language skills and no advanced job skills.</p>

<p>Washing dishes and/or cleaning toilets in a foreign land may be your only options there. I don&#39;t think this is the key to happiness, unless your lot is a lot worse in your home country.</p>

<p>BTW - What is your home country?
If it&#39;s the USA, you REALLY need to rethink this plan as the US Economy is FAR better than any EU economy with many more job opportunities.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was an expat in an asian country for a while, and have researched living overseas on several occasions in the past.  It&#39;s sad, but it&#39;s very hard to change citizenship unless you marry someone from the other country.  An alternative is to be someone high up in your field of expertise or of course if you are rich.  Otherwise, you almost can&#39;t get citizenship anywhere else unless you are rich.  You&#39;ll end up paying visa fees, and have to cross borders just to extend your stay, wherever you end up.  I&#39;m not trying to rain on your parade, but it&#39;s very difficult to do.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It used to be that if your lineage was unbroken PATERNAL lineage to an Italian grandparent or even great-grandparent, it was easy.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.youritalianpassport.com/qualifications-for-italian-citizenship.php">http://www.youritalianpassport.com/qualifications-for-italian-citizenship.php</a> </p>

<p>According to Italian Law 91 of February 5, 1992, Italian citizenship is conferred by bloodline.  In other words, the descendant of an Italian citizen is already an Italian citizen.  The descendant need only have his/her Italian citizenship recognized by the Italian government.  An individual seeking to have his/her Italian citizenship recognized need only to produce evidence that everyone in his/her direct line of ascendants uninterruptedly maintained their Italian citizenship. </p>

<p>It usually is a bit more difficult than it sounds, but it&#39;s doable. I did it.</p>

<p>There are sites that offer services, but I CANNOT VOUCH FOR THEM! They could be legit, or could be scammers. Here is one I found via Google (NOT an endorsement!):

    <div class="md"><p>Start with some long vacations first. Contract work if you can get it. I lived and worked in Germany for a year. The first month was great. All new things, learning something every day. Then it got boring. By month 3, I was proficient enough in the language to have decent conversation. By month 4 I was bored again. I started traveling to france, Czech Republic, etc and found that English and German languages would get me around, but working outside of my current contract was really difficult as I was on a German work visa, paid by my company, and that added somewhere near 20% to my cost. Tough to find work if I&#39;m 20% more expensive than a local.</p>
