    <div class="md"><p>@3:10 You gonna shoot me like you shoot everyone else fuckin&#39; greaseball</p>

<p>Yeah I don&#39;t think it helps the situation saying silly things. </p>

<p>Sure swearing at a cop isn&#39;t illegal (depending on location I assume), but it doesn&#39;t help giving them ammo where they can say you were aggressive. </p>

<hr/>

<p>The reality is that once a cop has made their decision to ticket you, arguing with them isn&#39;t going to do anything but make things worse. Just record, stay calm and appeal the ticket through the standard route. That&#39;s all you can and should do. </p>

<p>Unless you really believe calling a cop a dickhead is going to make them reconsider citing you? I doubt it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well there is a hell of a lot more to this story than the video. About 30 minutes more. I ended up getting 3 different court dates and infractions for stuff I already have on my bike. The only thing I don&#39;t have is mirrors. He said I had no insurance, tail light, reflectors, and a bunch of other stuff I have dated pictures showing are on the bike when I rebuilt it a month ago and once he pulled me over for flipping him off do you really think even if I was calm I&#39;d be any different.

You&#39;re willfully being ignorant to the fact that you were lawfully stopped and you were even given three receipts (citations) for your stop.  This is why you&#39;re getting downvoted to oblivion and your youtube video is doing even worse. YOU WERE LEGALLY DETAINED whether you agree with it or not.

<p>Did you ever stop to think he may have just been admiring your bike? Or perhaps he was just daydreaming at the stop light, thinking about what time his shift was over while looking in your general direction? Sure the cop is an asshole for the way he reacted, but so are you.</p>

<p>The fact is you&#39;re gutless, and you wouldn&#39;t dare have stuck that finger up to a Vago or a Hell&#39;s Angel that threw an extended glance in your direction. You picked a fight with a guy who you knew couldn&#39;t smash your teeth in, that&#39;s not something you should brag about to anyone.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Apparently you don&#39;t know shit. Do some research on your rights asshole. Freedom of expression. But, until then all you can go back to claiming someone is a fucking robot and the government is evil and whatever other horse shit you believe.  Who&#39;s bragging about anything? I&#39;m merely showing that you can&#39;t do something (YOUR LEGALLY ALLOWED TO DO) without a violation of your rights. I don&#39;t really care about your personal opinion. what I did was legal and that&#39;s that. Rights don&#39;t change due to your perception of it or a bias towards it. Keep thinking my rights weren&#39;t violated but it takes a 2 second Google search &quot;Flipping off a cop&quot; to see just how very wrong you are.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not quite sure why it&#39;s not registering with you, but you went looking for trouble and then are upset that you found it. If the cop tried to write a ticket for some ad hoc law they made up on the spot just to mess with you, yes you would have a leg to stand on. Should they have pulled you over? Maybe, maybe not, but you asked for attention and you got it. The finger was secondary here. Maybe you should have ensured that, before tempting fate, you couldn&#39;t be pegged for anything, no? Surely if nothing else you can at least admit that you <em>probably</em> should have first made sure the cop could have <em>nothing</em> else on you, right?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Clearly the cop was on an ego trip. You pissed him off, and he behaved unethically. To put it in layman&#39;s terms, the cop was a douchebag.</p>

<p>However, who in their right mind flips off a cop and doesn&#39;t expect retaliation? Knowing what we know about the profile of certain cops, BAD decision. It could have escalated even further, and you would have been on the nightly news. </p>

<p>I&#39;m not saying that&#39;s right, but don&#39;t act so immaturely.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I support your actions. You seem to be getting a lot of hate from the passives in here, but nothing will ever change until we start calling out unprofessional public servants when they start abusing their authority. No one should be pulled over and harassed for merely being annoyed and insulted that someone <em>we pay to enforce law</em> was staring at them like they are a criminal. Just because others in here are gutless and bend over to take as much dick as a cop wants to shove in their ass does not mean you should as well. The way you handled the situation was perfect.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Fuck the bootlickers in the room, no spit. You did the right thing by expressing yourself without actually harming anyone. </p>

<p>It is remarkable how even here, cop worship and fear of reprisal keeps people from making their mark righteously. </p>

<p>A public servant giving you the side eye while you&#39;re blatantly obeying every law under the sun while they are doing it, deserves the bird. </p>

<p>They work for us, we own them. Fucking pig should have been grateful for your attention. </p>

<p>Yet the sense of worship is so deeply ingrained so many wronged persons will conjure up reasons why they were the faulty party. It is insanity at its finest.</p>

<p>Edit:
Down votes, weapon of choice for the professional bootlicker... Nothing to say, just simpering silent desperation for the gumption to speak out against tyrannical stupidity. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sidebar, once the swine engages in hostility toward you; it is best to regard them silently and with detatched interest. Never forget, you own that badge, and unless they kill you on the spot, you CAN make their life harder by using the silly little rules (Law) to your advantage. This does, inconveniently enough, come at the cost of playing by those rules in a &#39;certain&#39; manner.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Dude, there was no violation of your rights. Cut the freedom fighter bullshit. </p>

<p>Did you ever stop to think he may have just been admiring your bike? Or perhaps he was just daydreaming at the stop light, thinking about what time his shift was over while looking in your general direction? Sure the cop is an asshole for the way he reacted, but so are you.</p>

<p>The fact is you&#39;re gutless, and you wouldn&#39;t dare have stuck that finger up to a Vago or a Hell&#39;s Angel that threw an extended glance in your direction. You picked a fight with a guy who you knew couldn&#39;t smash your teeth in, that&#39;s not something you should brag about to anyone.</p>

<p>Lastly, this is not even close to a conspiracy. Go get your validation from r/SJW.  </p>
