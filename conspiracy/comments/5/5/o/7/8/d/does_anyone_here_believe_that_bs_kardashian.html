<p>But does this really sound believable to anyone here?</p>

<p>Kim K has no security detail?</p>

<p>Even if not, it seems like a place that would have cameras so let&#39;s see some proof. </p>

<p>There&#39;s speculation that there will be another wikileaks dump tomorrow for their 10 yr anniversary. My take on this fake celeb story is that it serves to distract from any wikileaks related news tomorrow and a kim k story is a great way to distract American idiots and SJWs. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have several years experience with celebrities and musical acts and honestly this smells. I just can&#39;t imagine that her security fucked up so badly. Like, not only does she have visible security but undercover security and with someone of her level residences and hotels work out the security details MONTHS in advance. Usually (even with the people I&#39;ve worked with who are notable but not her level) you would have key card access only and/or security posted at all entry points to check credentials not to mention multiple other standard &#39;tricks&#39; to secure rooms and floors. No security company worth a damn would have had their whole crew sleeping. You work in shifts and you usually rent the room next to your client (if not you are ALWAYS near).</p>

<p>Maybe she let them because they were dressed like cops? Maybe, but again, I can&#39;t imagine how her security let them slip through. They&#39;d have consulted with her first if there had been an issue before alerting police, they&#39;d have escorted them to her door, and the hotel staff would have had to let them up onto the floor (which would have alerted security). Even then I seriously can&#39;t fathom how they were able to get in, rob her, and disappear without security ever knowing given they have constant access to her. </p>

<p>Either her security screwed up really really really badly, this was an elaborate inside job by the hotel, or it&#39;s a fake.</p>

<p>They keep releasing little &#39;details&#39; to cover the holes in the story. I have no ill feelings toward her, I just simply don&#39;t buy it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>How do you know what kind of security she has? Could just be one big dude following her around. Even if it was several guys, with a gun or whatever pointed at their principal, they would have kind of sat back and hoped it was just a simple robbery rather than further risk Kim by acting and possibly causing the robbers to pull the trigger. Just wait, give em the money, and let them peace out. </p>

<p>I&#39;m sure there are certain times they have extensive security indeed, but just walking around in a relatively safe area, it&#39;s probably just a couple or even one guard. Less likely to draw attention </p>

    <div class="md"><p>From CNN:</p>

<p>&quot;The French Interior Ministry said the culprits were disguised as police officers. Five men threatened the concierge at the mansion with a weapon, handcuffed him and forced him to open the private apartment.&quot;</p>

<p>There&#39;s no way there wasn&#39;t Camera&#39;s where the concierge was so I expect to see footage of this interaction. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Firstly- her having that amount of jewellery doesn&#39;t mean it was hers. Hip hop bling bling is all rented from jewellers. Look it up. So I imagine the jeweller would benefit from any insurance and not &#39;Kimye&#39;.</p>

<p>Also, just read up some of the bank robberies, jewellery heists and art thefts in France. They have some serious thieves. So this is all entirely plausible and in my opinion not a conspiracy by the brain dead &#39;kimye&#39; duo- but a skilled criminal conspiracy by French or Serbian jewel theives. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think it&#39;s a likely distraction to the upcoming wikileaks.. She also just re-proclaimed her support for Hillary last week after briefly considering Trump.. so I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if they try to twist this into a gun control thing or use Kim to speak about it (even though Paris has a ban on guns which means only criminals have them, they won&#39;t mention that) but yes, something fishy and lots of possibilities until we at least see a video. It is important to remember that it is also very possible that someone actually could try to rob her and get her into that situation.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I heard on my local news (_I don&#39;t know if the story changed, I refuse to search for these people) the $10mil in jewelry was on loan.</p>

<p>If that is the case, there is something hinky going on.
Heck, even if that isn&#39;t the case, this sounds like BS.</p>

<p>I used to work in a hotel and when celebs or wealthy guests had &quot;loans on&quot; for an event, within minutes of their return to the hotel the Jewelry store(with their own guards) would be there to collect the jewelry.</p>

<p>The really rich guests would travel with their own safes, book connected rooms and have guards in the rooms at all times.
Even the hotel maids were not allowed into the room with out a call down to the desk to check if they were legitimate and they were not left unsupervised.
 The room with the safe were usually not cleaned until guest departure.</p>
