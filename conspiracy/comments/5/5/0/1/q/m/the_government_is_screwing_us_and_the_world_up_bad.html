    <div class="md"><p>Hey dude I&#39;m going to open your eyes hopefully more. God opened our eyes to this, he told us Satan was the ruler of the world until the end. It&#39;s going to get worse and worse and we will be tempted with the biggest deception ever coming up. Likely with fake extra terrestrials and other things claiming we will live forever. We already do live forever we&#39;re spirits.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Your Christian God is the seed implanted in the minds of young people to make them more prone to the idea of submitting to a higher authority, i.e. the government. </p>

<p>Satan opened your eyes, thats what occured when Eve ate from the Tree of Knowlege of Good and Evil. Lucifer is the bringer of light and by demonizing him you demonize free thought and free will. The Christian concept of Original Sin is just a clever ploy to make people ashamed of their own free will. </p>

<p>Most religions serve this purpose, to keep people subservient and ignorant.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes sir you are 100% correct. That&#39;s why I say no religion. Bible prophecy is coming true and acting as close to christ as you can will get your eye open with the fewest regrets to face. :) You are 100% right I agree with everything you said.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Prophecy is still being fulfilled. Satan was needed to get us here but we will be better off if we unite as one and take what we have learned and remake it. They are running us all off the edge. If you agree our government is corrupt and we can make a world equivalent to heaven you are with me. Satan did open my eyes yes. The bible depicts the snake as the deceiver. What it fails to mention is the snake lives inside you and has to be conquered. </p>

<p>I am not an orthodox religion. Truth is the highest religion. I live in truth and spread truth. Hopefully one day the truth will shine through. </p>
