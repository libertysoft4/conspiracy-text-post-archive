<p>Then I read the <a href="http://defconwarningsystem.com/?p=150">monthly DEFCON Warning System update</a> and noticed this excerpt: </p>

<blockquote>
<p>The United States is expanding its espionage operations against Russia on a scale not seen since the Cold War. The Senate Armed Services Committee has been informed that <strong>China and Russia are rapidly building space warfare capabilities and that the United States is lagging behind its ability to defend against these threats.</strong></p>

<p>So I did a little more research and found these articles (All very recent)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You seem a little confused, so I am guessing you are new here.  I would suggest you look at space station videos:  notice the wire harnesses holding people up by the belt; see the over hair-sprayed hair; observe the limited anti-gravitational effects.  Most people have concluded that these videos are fabricated using planes that descend rapidly to briefly create the effects of &quot;space&quot;.  Additionally, it has been revealed that most &quot;space&quot; walks take place in a water tank or large pool as there can be bubbles seen in most of the videos.  Finally, the &quot;live feed&quot; is an elaborate CGI setup filmed from an under water studio.  Don&#39;t take my word for it; there are hordes of Youtube videos that go over this stuff.  The conclusion:  modern space travel is fake.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You cannot see the space station at night, only high altitude planes staging photographs.  Also, the sun is not some advanced piece of technology that our earth-bound sun-loving friends at NASA are pretending exists.  Look, there are tons of CGI photographs out there of satellites taking pictures of satellites and stuff - the ideas promoted by NASA&#39;s graphic team are all stacked up on top of empirical theories that are not proven.  Obviously, more than a few people here believe in &quot;space&quot; and fantastical places you can visit.  This is not for me, and, I would like to create a bit of doubt in your mind - perhaps enough doubt that gets you really thinking, really researching.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Obviously, all those lights up there are somewhere.  Sure, we can call this area &quot;space&quot;, but these are not places you can visit - instead, these are fairly close luminous bodies; closer than you have been taught.  There is no such thing as LOE, or orbiting.  Nothing has been historically proven to orbit; in fact, the opposite has been shown to be the case (e.g. the earth does not move under a hovering balloon).  Aside from these suppositions, I do not have any real answers.  For example, I am not going to say that the earth is flat; only, it is not what we have been shown and orbiting is not possible.  I am not going to say space does not exist since those stars are somewhere that is not here.  The only conclusive piece if information I have to offer, really, is that what we have been told about the nature of our world is not true.  Anybody doing even a little research into the subject should also come to this conclusion.</p>

This does not jive with the theory of gravity as it is supposed that the earth is an oblate sphere.

    <div class="md"><p>A ) That&#39;s not how deterrence works. When you get something, you tell everyone so they don&#39;t overestimate their chances of success at trying something. It&#39;s why the world freaked the fuck out when they found out about the Russian Dead Hand system. </p>

<p>B ) Building something like a kinetic bombardment launch platform would get a <em>lot</em> of attention. You can&#39;t really hide what you&#39;re doing in space. Multiple trips to the same object would arouse suspicion, and ground based telescopes would see what it was with relative ease. </p>

<p>It&#39;s a good concept, but it also faces major issues. Namely how do you get a multi-ton tungsten rod into orbit, to then drop it back down, if you&#39;re using a stationary launcher? It would require dozens of trips to even load it, let-alone build it and maintain it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>A) The deterrence in this case is a treaty that bans militarisation of space. We wouldn&#39;t tell anyone we have something that breaks a treaty we helped to make happen. We would keep our orbital platform secret and be pissed if we see someone else start building one.</p>

<p>B) Building something like a kinetic bombardment launch platform would not get a lot of attention in today&#39;s world. How many times have you heard about a new satellite being launched? How many times have you heard about us using decommissioned space shuttles for autonomous orbit experiments? In today&#39;s world we wouldn&#39;t even suspect a  rod of got instillation.</p>

<p>It&#39;s a great concept, it doesn&#39;t face any major issues. Do you think we haven&#39;t been putting multi-ton objects into orbit already, only to have them drop back down?  Also you act like we can&#39;t do synchronous orbit. Ya know we can do that with mulit-ton objects right? It would require one trip to load a rod into a decommissioned space craft that we send up under pretence of an autonomous orbit experiment. Nice try sleeper but you won&#39;t win against someone who has open eyes.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Which the US did not sign or take part in, and was one of the only two abstentions. The only space treaty applying to the US is one against the placement of WMD&#39;s in space.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Yes, yes it would. Both governments an hobbyists track launched space craft regularly, and it&#39;s very hard to hide a satellite doing something in space.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>How many times have you heard about a new satellite being launched?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>All the time, and each satellite is accounted for. Even the DOD satellites have their purposes known due to their orbits.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>How many times have you heard about us using decommissioned space shuttles for autonomous orbit experiments?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Never. That has never happened.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It&#39;s a great concept, it doesn&#39;t face any major issues.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Oh yes, yes it does.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>One trip to load each rod, and multiple to complete the satellite, which would certainly be the size of, if not larger than the Hubble. Since the US lost it&#39;s heavy weight workhorse, it would have to be Delta-4 flights, which are much more conspicuous. If you have multiple launches, (with some manned due to needing to manually do work - have fun getting to space right now without the Russians) going to the same place that <em>isn&#39;t</em> the ISS, other places are going to get <em>very</em> interested in that satellite, and you can&#39;t really hide a satellite.</p>

<p>I really hope this is a joke.</p>
