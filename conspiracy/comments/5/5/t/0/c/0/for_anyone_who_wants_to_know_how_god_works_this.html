    <div class="md"><p>You suggested I watch this. I enjoyed the content. But this isn&#39;t news to me. I understand very deeply the power of emotion and taking hold of your desired metaphysical plane. But I still would like an unbiased and reputable news source to emerge. One on the lookout for humanity. Maybe if I care about it enough, it will emerge or begin to exist. Therefore, I ask you: what emotions or energies are you channeling? Are you letting yourself be taken by fear? Or are you existing in a state of love and acceptance? Focus on that. You don&#39;t have to answer this now. Just keep that question in your mind. Realize that we are mediums through which energy can and will be channelled, whether it be positive or negative. Energy that has existed since way before us.  </p>

<p>I hope this pushes you in the right direction. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I am only here to help you guys fix the world. The world is pointless I&#39;ve always known. I know what I am. My 3rd eye is already open. I already defeated my lower chakras. I ain&#39;t normal nigga. I will eat down votes and hate but this is exactly where the truth is. If I figure it out and learn what the special feeling is inside the heart I will be able to start doing things. I have studied the occult and magic and such already to some point. I see through lies like america eats mcdonalds french fries. I am not normal people are going to hate but I will add something here to show you how there is an equal amount of people hating and loving this. I believe what you are saying is merely the minor capabilities. I think if you know the true keys like Thoth and others it may be possible to move mountains by saying &quot;Mountain Move.&quot;</p>

<p>When I went to bed I said I went from +9 to +15 karma. Well now I&#39;m at +25 and still no movement I&#39;m at 0 points. Clearly shills at work. I am too smart to let others bring me down it&#39;s the power of the third eye. Will start replying to PM&#39;s ppl have sent me now. This is true human potential. Probably has something to do with a clean body too.</p>

Generally we&#39;re confined to the patterns of manifestation that we&#39;ve been taught and this is how we as humans can be programmed.

    <div class="md"><p>I now believe kids are born with super natural powers and it is possible. They just somehow got the grace of the matrix to show them how, or somehow figured it out themselves. Everything today wonks our consciousness and thoughts out of what they are naturally so that we can&#39;t obtain the true powers of this. This is the super natural force all over the earth. I have seen videos of monks chanting and watching cancer disappear on a woman. Didn&#39;t know if I should believe it but I see it now. Time to learn the matrix people. We are going to become God. The kingdom of heaven is in us and God has chosen the worthy. All we need to do is step up, learn how it works, and start to use it. In no time we will be able to bring the world the leaders they deserve.</p>

<p>here are some more bullshit studies you probably believe.</p>

<p>Starving is bad. But fasting is very good for you. Just like above I&#39;m sure you believe starving is bad, there is the perfect study for you to follow and believe. Spread your beliefs they are very likely entirely true! </p>

<p>here&#39;s a study about debunking the sphere earth. As you can see they have very good evidence in the two studies above, yet they are entirely false. That post will show you your flaws in logic. If you suck the balls of every ball earther until you can see no other possibility you&#39;re obviously going to never look at the other side. Have a good day I&#39;m not replying. I am one already, completed 777. You aren&#39;t. </p>

<p>Oh, I shall.</p>

<p>So now you&#39;re resorting to strawman arguments? Just because I follow the science behind globe earth that means I must believe everything? You still have yet to back up your bullshit claims with science. You say your claims are &quot;facts&quot;, and then expect me to take your word for it. Guess what? Your word is worth exactly nothing until you can provide evidence of it. </p>

<p>You claimed that the sun changes size over the course of the day. If it does, you should be able to provide easy evidence of such. You haven&#39;t. </p>

<p>You claimed that &quot;Sun spinning doesn&#39;t make sense it curves like a C any point on earth.&quot; - Aside from not even being proper english, it doesn&#39;t make any sense whatsoever. Would you like to try and rephrase this nonsense, or are you going to claim again that it&#39;s a &quot;fact&quot; and doesn&#39;t need support?</p>

<p>It makes someone sound absurd to even suggest the earth is flat, and that&#39;s where the psyop is.</p>

<p>It&#39;s why nasa lies about space. To keep up their biggest lie, flat earth. They are getting so grandiose with their lies with comet landers and shit, it&#39;s all gonna come crumbling down.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah well for me, all I had to do is hang out with my Science Professor neighbor who tied a go-pro camera to a massive silver weather balloon he had access and permits for near where I live. We all gathered for the event and launched it into the very high end of the Atmosphere as close to the border as space as possible, and took pics, and you can see the roundness of the earth from your own experiments and know once and for all that flat earth is bullshit.</p>

<p>But you know, have fun with that. I gave the flat earther stuff a look, and I guess it would make sense if you just no longer believe in science and don;t have the ability to do some simple budget friendly DIY experiments.</p>

<p>A geostationary orbit, geostationary Earth orbit or geosynchronous equatorial orbit (GEO) is a circular orbit 35,786 kilometres (22,236 mi) above the Earth&#39;s equator and following the direction of the Earth&#39;s rotation.</p>

<p>This video is not of a satellite following the earths rotation. So. LOL.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, you&#39;re not 9. </p>

<p>So are all the other planets flat too, or just earth? Because anyone with a telescope can see the other planets are spherical. </p>

<p>Also, the sphere is the principle organizanizing shape for self-attracting particles in 3D space. I can go more in depth if you&#39;re interested, but essentially:</p>

<p>-if gravity exists (it does)</p>

<p>-if all matter has mass (it does)</p>

<p>-if, for all practical purposes, the spatial universe has 3 dimensions </p>

<p>Then the default configuration for all bodies beyond a certain scale is spherical due to self-attraction.</p>

<p>Also, if the videos from balloons only show curvature because of fisheye, why aren&#39;t the videos distorted on the ground? Do the lenses magically get swapped mid-flight by the sky demon? Consider this: if <em>every</em> video was using a fisheye lense couldn&#39;t you and your merry band of meth addled compatriots send a non-fisheye camera up and break the world-wide Million+ person conspiracy?</p>

<p>Seriously, go get a camera with no fisheye + high altitude balloon and let it go. Total cost maybe $500. That&#39;s nothing to change the world! You could even kickstart it. Then you could finally &quot;prove&quot; your idea and be famous. </p>

<p>But oddly enough, no one has ever done this. The biggest conspiracy ever you can prove for &lt;$500 and no one has ever tried to catch them! Crazy!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My up votes are going wonky for submitted posts. It&#39;s obvious people are up voting this and it&#39;s being tinkered with by Reddit. Copy the video and relate it to anything you can find. I know I can alternate it myself to some extent because I have before. I thought it was God. Turns out it is, but it&#39;s me too. God listens but there are the rules to the game. If you know this work start something and invite me I will share what I know.Discord or anything, skype if you know something don&#39;t be shy we can figure it out. It&#39;s all about chanting and wanting. Magic mushrooms are useful now, I understand why. It deletes all your baggage so magic mushrooms are really magic. They remove negative emotion so you can do miracles easier. Makes you wonder if the people on mushrooms were hallucinating or if they really did pull off miracles. Obviously a combination of both but I&#39;d love to try to recreate it with anyone. Down with the old world we will manifest anything according to our will. </p>

<p>Another thought, the pyramids are incomplete. Chant the correct words at the pyramid and they will re complete themselves??</p>
