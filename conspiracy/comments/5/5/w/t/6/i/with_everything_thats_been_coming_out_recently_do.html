I feel like being aware of all this going on makes me well-equipped with a healthy amount of skepticism to operate in the world, but at the same time it makes it difficult for me to be happy and maintain a positive outlook on the future compared to when I was a teenager. I wanted to leave this here because I don&#39;t know who else I would talk to about it. It seems like other people are either completely unaware/distracted by their day-to-day lives or know things are wrong but just don&#39;t care to do anything/talk about it so I figured this sub would be the best place for it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m 39, have my first child who&#39;s a year and a half old. I&#39;m wondering what is going to be left by the time he&#39;s even 16.</p>

<p>Corrupt fascist government aside, we&#39;ve got scary things happening right now. Pollinators are going extinct. Seeds and food are essentially controlled, modified and corrupted by corporations. People are dependent on tech and have no survival skills other than their gun.
I seriously wonder what we&#39;ll be eating in 10, 15 years. I wonder what tales I&#39;ll be telling my son about things that no longer exist in his world then. &#39;What were bees again dad? You mean clean water wasn&#39;t always just in government-rationed nestle bottles?&#39;</p>

<p>We have a plan, and we already live fairly secluded in the mountains. Still I worry how I&#39;ll get over the loss of creature comforts and digital information, plentiful food and water when those times come. I feel that by preparing him now, my son will fare better than I will. And that&#39;s what it&#39;s all about. We aren&#39;t preppers by any means but we are a little more off grid and a little more self sufficient every year. Farming isn&#39;t an option on our land, and it&#39;d be fined or regulated if it were. </p>

<p>Still, I seethe that our children are heading toward a dark future controlled by a handful of selfish elitist families who will forever have more than they need, who will keep brainwashing the useless idiot majority, the people who my kid will have to contend with every day to survive.</p>

<p>At this point The Road is looking like a fairy tale compared to what&#39;s coming.
For now, we enjoy nature as much as we can, we eat healthy (as much as one can with our options) and enjoy our time together. I wish we lived in a world where that was enough for people.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The whole purpose of life is to overcome that feeling of dread that is dumped on everyone from everything and train your mind...your mind... To feel love instead and to do that, it takes objective focus on the emotion you feel, itself.  Learn how to disconnect all the &quot;petty&quot; physical causes and turn the actual suffering itself into love.  </p>

<p>Training in this and mastery of this will make your life worth living and I believe let you stay in the infinite when you pass on.  The rest get sent back and have to keep trying to learn about this.</p>

<p>There is fear and there is love.  0 and 1.  Nothing or infinite.
Everything else is just a stimuli for your mind to create those feelings with.  </p>

<p>Aiming for content 90% and happy 10% is realistic and allows that 10 to grow.  Start from calm.  </p>

<p>But it&#39;s like...my opinion mannnn and it&#39;s always a challenge to live what I speak.  Everyone deserves love though.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s when all the dark stuff in the subconscious rises up, and all you feel is depression and anxiety. You see the world as it is, and it&#39;s clear you cannot hold onto stuff you used to. It foces you to let go of many stuff you used to deem essential. It&#39;s a very profound transformation, a death and rebirth experience, and a necessary part of spiritual evolution. There were some good stuff that Jung wrote about this, but I am not in a good situation find them now.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>True but weed isn&#39;t the solution, it won&#39;t fix a broken spirit and people can develop an unhealthy dependency on it. Obviously there is a lot of misunderstanding about the substance but I am almost as tired of people touting it as a wunderdrug that everyone should use and has no negative side effects at all, because none of that is true. It will cloud you and impact short term memory, it does affect reaction timing, and can bring on accute paranoia (though not psychosis, weed on set psychosis is just a myth). </p>

<p>Still smoke it daily though... Just sayin</p>

<p>when I was a teenager I was much more cynical and negative.  the threat of nuclear war was much more prevalent before MAD (do we still have MAD?) </p>

<p>lasting happiness comes after the danger is gone.   As we and our families (pretty much everyone who isn&#39;t 0.01%)  are in danger then vigilance is appropriate at all times.    </p>

<p>To be honest I don&#39;t think any of us know what the superpowers are capable of technologically, if one were to have a significant advantage I think it would most likely be the U.S., vis-à-vis GDP, spending on defense, NATO synergies, etc., however it&#39;s impossible to know for sure unless you are literally a SAP defense analyst (if that&#39;s even a job...). At the same time, I have no idea if this would be enough to fight Russia/China, especially across multiple fronts.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This sounds like it&#39;s your first taste of conspiratorial and corrupt behaviour so naturally you will feel a bit down when you realize the world is not what you thought it was.  Especially as you become aware that not only has this been going on for millennia but that it is far more widespread and greater in magnitude than you could ever imagine.  </p>

<p>The other reason to feel depressed is, as you say, everyone else is unaware and distracted.  However, what is happening right now in the general public is bordering on unprecedented and is cause for great optimism.  For you, arriving just now, it seems that so few people are aware. But what was the public&#39;s perception of conspiracy like 5 or 10 years ago?  Trust me, it was FAR more stagnant than today.  You&#39;re living in a time where awareness is growing at an enormous rate.  It will be the cause of great change long overdue.  Enjoy the ride.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well I&#39;m going to be 50 next year and back when I was in HS in the early 80s, we were really worried about the Cold War going hot.  I live in OKC and just to the East is Tinker Air Force Base, where they maintain the US AWACS Radar Fleet.  We grew up knowing we were an early target if Russia ever decided to launch their nukes...and Regan was all too willing to hype this fear at every opportunity.</p>

<p>It was difficult to be positive and up beat when faced with annihilation but then again, it&#39;s not.  It&#39;s all a matter of focus.  What you focus on determines your reality.</p>

<p>Don&#39;t believe me?  Ok....I use the stop light analogy to illustrate the point.</p>

<p>Two cars pull of the a stoplight.  In the first car is a woman who&#39;s running late to an important appointment.  She&#39;s under a tremendous amount of pressure in her life and as every second ticks by, she&#39;s getting angrier and angrier because she&#39;s becoming later and later.  In the second car is a woman that is thankful for the red light.  She gets a breather, a respite, a break from the chaos of her life.  She looks around and notices all the little birds flying every which way, she notices the beautiful green trees set against the background of a beautiful blue sky with white puffy clouds and she breathes deep and relaxes into the moment.</p>

<p>Now - both women experienced the exact same stimulus, the red light, but both are experiencing VERY different realities because of their focus.  </p>

<p>If you want to experience a different reality, change your focus and what you perceive will change accordingly.  </p>

<p>Also if you want to check out some cooler things about consciousness check out <a href="/r/DimensionalJumping">/r/DimensionalJumping</a> or the book <a href="https://www.drbrucegoldberg.com/fifth-dimension-book.html">Exploring the 5th Dimension</a> or any number of other resources about how powerful our minds are.  One classic is <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Think-Grow-Rich-Napoleon-Hill/dp/149617545X">Think and Grow Rich</a> which I&#39;m sure you can find at your local library.</p>

<p>One helpful thing to remember about fear is that it&#39;s simply an acronym for:<br/>
<strong>F</strong>alse<br/>
<strong>E</strong>vidence<br/>
<strong>A</strong>pearing<br/>
<strong>R</strong>eal  </p>

<p>It just appears real but just because it appears that way doesn&#39;t make it true.  Just ignore it and live your life however you want.  </p>

<p>Cheers!</p>

<p>Well sometimes it&#39;s good to listen to fear.  Like yeah I&#39;m not about to go jumping off a bridge to prove how &#39;not afraid&#39; I am....so yeah it&#39;s good to listen to fear in those types of instances.</p>
