    <div class="md"><p>In addition, Newsham was also responsible for ordering the mass arrests of demonstrators during a 2002 anti-globalization protest:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Newsham was not only responsible for the mass arrests in 2002 of more than 400 protesters and bystanders at an anti-Globalization protest, which cost the city more than $10 million and resulted in guidelines for how police should interact with protesters (which he seems to have violated at the recent DC crackdown), he has other problems in his history.</p>

<p>According to FOX 5, which asks Is Interim DC Police Chief Peter Newsham fit to be top cop?, the leading candidate to become the DC police chief, allegedly has a personal history of alcoholism and spousal abuse. In addition, they recount a story where he authorized the arrest an 11 year old girl who was allegedly gang raped, she “was charged with filing a false report after her account of events were found to be inconsistent– despite several medical accounts detailing her sexual injuries and the findings of multiple samples of semen on her underwear. . . it was Newsham who allowed investigators to charge her 11-year-old daughter over locking up the men who raped her.”</p>

<p>On the 2002 mass arrests FOX reports:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“The arrests that followed the 2002 demonstration protesting meetings between the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund also reportedly cost taxpayers nearly $3 million just to defend Newsham and then Police Chief Charles Ramsey. Not only did Newsham order the wrongful mass arrest, but he was virtually allowed to investigate himself because at the time, he was also head of the Office of Professional Responsibility—the ethics branch of the police department.</p>

<p>“It was ultimately discovered that the log of events that would have certified and documented the chain of command and orders made that day completely vanished. The evidence somehow disappeared in the immediate aftermath of the arrests. Messineo added, ‘You have the mass false arrest of 400 persons, followed by a massive coverup. Peter Newsham has never apologized, he’s never indicated that what he did was wrong. I believe that what the facts show, he knew it was wrong. if you look at what the court opinion found, the court opinions found that no reasonable police officer could have ordered these mass arrests.’”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There were more than 100 applicants for the police chief job. The decision will be made by Mayor Muriel Bowser. The mother of the young girl arrested for reporting allegedly being raped wrote Bowser saying “You are about to unleash a monster in this city, that will not have any restraints and in years to come, you will have to hold yourself accountable. . .“ KZ</p>

<p>The man is a living pile excrement, and apparently fits in well with his city and his department, respectively.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Uh....There was multiple semen samples in taken from her and the telltale signs of rape/sexual abuse.That is fact.This guy CHOOSE to ignore this and tried to scare her by threatening to charge her with filing a false report.</p>

<p>Do you really think she abused herself and collected multiple male semen samples and put them in herself and all over her underwear?This was a cover-up.Plain and simple.</p>

<p>I am not indicting all police and police chief&#39;s,btw.There are many good and honest cops just as there are many who are pieces of shit.The problem is that the good guys swear an oath to never cross the blue line i.e. never narc a fellow officer out unless the order is sent down to do so.I had a parent who was a police officer so I know the dirt that goes on from the inside.They protect each other 99% of the time.</p>

<p>So spare me your defense of this &quot;man&quot;.There was direct evidence of a rape that he obviously chose to ignore.</p>

<p>Which is the entire fucking basis for pizzagate. </p>

<p>Put it like this - we have no evidence Donald Trump is a carrot. However we have seem him eating carrots. Thus it is logical to investigate if Donald Trump is actually a carrot. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>so you think Comet Pizza had like secret doors and stuff where unassuming kids were grabbed and thrown down a chute or something?</p>

<p>Pedophilia and child trafficking go hand-in-hand. The kids they use for their rituals or events are not local kids who are on amber alert; they are children stolen from far away somewhere or kids without families. To get those types of children, you end up in child trafficking. Nobody is claiming that random children were plucked from their families in the DC area; like you say, there would be a big uproar about why kids go missing at this pizza place if that were true. You&#39;d want to look more into missing or kidnapped children and kids who are coming in as illegal immigrants - and that&#39;s how child trafficking comes into it.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It&#39;s evidence no children are known to have come to harm at comet ping pong though.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Let&#39;s say Comet Ping pong had &#39;kill rooms&#39;... they are called that for a reason. If a pedophile ring is using trafficked children, nobody is going to know about it because you are assuming there are still children to come forward. They could still be under their abusers control, or they could be dead. How would we know then?</p>

<p>So you&#39;re being reductive. Hey - Alex Jones says Pizzagate is just the distraction from the real stuff, and that it&#39;s a fake rabbit hole planted by the pedophiles to distract away from where they really don&#39;t want us to look. So maybe Pizzagate is bullshit, but pedophilia is not and neither is child trafficking. We owe it to the kids to not be naive because its more convenient for us who are free.</p>

<p>The fact is pizzagate makes specific claims about John Podesta and James Alefantis which are frankly laughable. Which is why I spend my time poking holes in these posts, it&#39;s to bloody easy. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, I read it as the kids being in the pool will be entertainment for the old guy who is coming out. Also, children are willingly put into pedo rings by the parents at times - the fact that there is a woman involved doesn&#39;t automatically mean that nothing is wrong either. Most kidnappings/molestations/etc. happen by somebody close to the victim - not random actors.</p>

<p>I&#39;m just saying its creepy. <a href="https://www.sott.net/article/334002-Progressive-liberal-values-Tony-Podestas-creepy-taste-in-art-the-creepy-people-he-hangs-out-with-and-Pizzagate">Have you seen Podesta&#39;s brother&#39;s taste in art?</a> It&#39;s not just one thing or another. There are breadcrumbs, and that&#39;s why people keep getting amped up about this.</p>

<p>Again, i&#39;m not even convinced that Pizzagate is the real issue. I think it could very well be a distraction from something bigger. I just don&#39;t agree with being willfully ignorant because the information is inconvenient.</p>

<p>But he also fraternized with him, rode around on his private jet, and associated with him on some level. This, in conjunction with some of the other comments he&#39;s made about women, and the woman who started to sue him and Epstein for rape (but dropped the case), makes me think Trump isn&#39;t so innocent either. </p>

<p>Let&#39;s be clear here -- I&#39;m not picking sides for an election that doesn&#39;t truly represent me anyways. I&#39;m just saying, they&#39;re both bad hombres. The argument here is not who is the baddest, it&#39;s about the crime(s) being committed. </p>

<p>Being sued doesn&#39;t mean you&#39;re guilty, pleading and admitting guilt are. Paying off plaintiffs is murky. I&#39;d say Epstein is guilty AF. Don&#39;t think trump is based on the evidence I&#39;ve seen.</p>

<p>Also many DC people and HRC, WJC, etc continue fraternizing with Epstein. I see that as way more suspicious.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, for one there was a women who twice brought a lawsuit against both him and Jeffrey Epstein for allegedly raping her when she was 13 years old, in 1994. Epstein has been convicted of soliciting minors for prostitution (in a separate case  that involved many girls as young as 14 and an undercover sting operation) and has been accused by victims of running a sex slave ring. </p>

<p>Trump&#39;s name was in Epstein&#39;s little black book (with 14 different numbers for him), alongside the names of several other men who were accused of raping another Epstein victim.</p>

<p>Trump has denied being in Epstein&#39;s &quot;lolita express&quot; plane, whereas Epstein has contradicted this and stated that Trump indeed has been on it.</p>

<p>When asked if he and Trump ever socialized together with underage girls, Epstein pleaded the 5th.</p>

<p>Quote by Trump: &quot;I&#39;ve known Jeff for fifteen years. Terrific guy. He&#39;s a lot of fun to be with. It is even said that he likes beautiful women as much as I do, and many of them are on the younger side. No doubt about it -- Jeffrey enjoys his social life.&quot;</p>

<p>Would you trust a convicted pedo/child molestor? I certainly wouldn&#39;t. Was Trump listed in the Lolita Express logbook like the Clintons were? I have seen nothing to prove this, but also haven&#39;t looked too hard. If not then I&#39;d rather not take a convicted pedo&#39;s word at face value.</p>

<p>Trump has admitted to knowing Epstein, and also admitted to booting him out of his club after Epstein was caught making lewd advances/comments to a member&#39;s young daughter. If Epstein hadn&#39;t been convicted at that point, and he had kept it quite secret until he was caught, then how can people be expected to know about his darkest secrets? Who knows, your best friend might murder prostitutes in his spare time. Does that mean you&#39;re a prostitute murderer too because you associate with him?</p>

<p>I agree that people choose their friends, and should avoid bad people. That said, if someone discovers something bad about a colleague/friend, then disavows, then that is fine with me. On the flipside, the Clintons continued to be associated with Epstein even after his conviction. You are as good as the company you keep.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Honestly, enjoying watching fake violence is fucked, but it&#39;s something so many of us enjoy, and are able to separate from reality, that it&#39;s socially acceptable. It&#39;s probably fair to say our enjoyment of fake violence comes from an animalistic aspect of our psyche that takes a sick pleasure from violence.</p>

<p>Enjoying cartoon CP, fictional or not, is not normal. It is sick, and enjoying it too likely comes from a part of the a pedo&#39;s psyche that takes pleasure in sex with children.</p>

<p>Given how dangerous enjoying the sexilization of children can be, any pleasure taken in the idea should be viewed accordingly.</p>

<p>It&#39;s well known that child abuse runs rampant in political power structures (as well as psychopaths) and has for countless years.  Why in the world would you think that shady characters like the Podestas (who are deep in the political power structures) would not be people involved?  </p>

<p>They fit the mold perfectly (I mean they literally even have art of naked children being abused in their homes and offices).  When you have so many difference pieces of circumstantial evidence pointing to the same shady groups and people you have to be pretty naive to not see that these people are involved in this stuff.  It&#39;s over the top obvious if you look at all the evidence put together.  Unfortunately the Podestas and friends are just some of many that are involved in this behavior.  Republicans at the highest level have been implicated in this stuff too, so it&#39;s a bipartisan issue.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Lol or the copious amounts of disturbing child art John podesta has in his home/office and that statue, or the amount of child pedophilia signs on their restaurant but sure that doesn&#39;t matter either huh? What is your bargain in denying something catastrophic ? Are you worried it&#39;s gonna be too big of a realization to gulp so you&#39;re happy living in your happy make belief , tv land to distract you or for you to avoid from ? If this child pedophilia ring is correct , then a bunch of kids get saved , a ton of evil , crooked , corrupt, disgusting people go to jail. 
If not then nothing happens. So tell me what exactly do you get from shooting down other people&#39;s amount of evidence that plenty of people can see. Tell me. I&#39;m honestly curious if you&#39;re disagreeing cuz you&#39;re scared of living in a world like this or are you just as sick as them fucks ?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I wasn&#39;t talking about that picture in Podesta&#39;s house bucko, I was asking about Abramovic. How is she related to the trafficking ring? How is it that get art, satanic as it may be, related to kids getting diddled? I won&#39;t disagree that Podesta&#39;s taste in art is questionable but it&#39;s questionable at best. If this had been an out and out picture of a naked child you would have had a point, but as far as we can tell its two paintings. Here:</p>

<p><a href="http://ibankcoin.com/zeropointnow/2016/11/26/sick-lets-revisit-the-podesta-penchant-for-pedophilic-cannibalistic-and-satanic-art/">http://ibankcoin.com/zeropointnow/2016/11/26/sick-lets-revisit-the-podesta-penchant-for-pedophilic-cannibalistic-and-satanic-art/</a></p>

<p>,one of your boys did a write up of it and he only names the two. If Podesta was a kid diddler, why didn&#39;t he just choose to hang the more fucked up ones? He had the option to, and according to that article he has no problem being fucked up. </p>

<p>Why he wants to see that kind of art,  is up to him at that point. Fucked up as it may seem, this isn&#39;t evidence. Him asking people over to see strange performance art isn&#39;t evidence either. It&#39;s strange art but we don&#39;t give people who are walking into galleries that host stuff like this and more grief, do we?</p>

Yes I have and not once did I see any children or anything remotely related to the allegatations we&#39;re discussing. She&#39;s a goddamn performance artist, one time she cut the shit out of her hands and passed out on a fire. How does any of this relate to child trafficking?</p>

Yeah but you didn&#39;t. Cmon man I just want to know why you think a group this well connected would supposedly choose a symbol that&#39;s so well known. </p>

<p>You know what people had in those situations, that you people have yet failed to produce? A mountain of material evidence and a shit ton of material WITNESSES. Where are the victims of this thing? You know, besides the one with multiple inconsistencies and straight up false details.  </p>

<p>Wasn&#39;t it one of your guys who shot up the pizza place, while families were fucking eating? I was asking a question, a genuine and sincere attempt to understand why you think these people act this way. I wanted to know why you think a group this well connected is being this overt. Literally the 5th time I&#39;ve asked. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s why if you&#39;re raped don&#39;t go to the police, go to some kind of private genetic testing paternity place with semen samples, take pics of the panties and then go to the ER to get documentation, telling them that police were involved so be discreet.  They usually notify police in these cases, if they do after they were told not to, you file arrest charges and sue the shit out of the doctor / staff who made the call for conspiracy to commit murder and you make sure everyone at the hospital knows about it by printing up leaflets and putting them underthe windowwiper of the hospital employee cars, explaining everything and you leave multiple voicemails and letters to the hospital administrator, who generally won&#39;t bother with plebs like us directly because they think we are all trash</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Adolf Hitler - The Man Who Fought The Banks (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=froTxqKSqc4">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=froTxqKSqc4</a>)</p>

<p>Haavara Agreement (&quot;Transfer Agreement&quot;) (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haavara_Agreement">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haavara_Agreement</a>)</p>

<p>I think it&#39;s essential to note that the majority of gassing locations were debunked by mainstream western historians in the 60&#39;s. In the 40&#39;s there were 10+ locations in Germany, Austria and Belgium (<a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/holocaust/comments/2unh6d/locations_where_poison_gases_were_allegedly_used/coaisk7">https://np.reddit.com/r/holocaust/comments/2unh6d/locations_where_poison_gases_were_allegedly_used/coaisk7</a>) where it was claimed that the Nazis gassed people, and there were witnesses and even Nazi &quot;confessors&quot; who swore this was true. Today, there are but six gassing locations, and all are in Poland. Importantly, the Soviets would not allow western inspection of the Polish camps in the 60&#39;s. In other words, the current allegations of &quot;Nazi gas chambers&quot; rely entirely on Soviet claims from the 1940&#39;s.</p>

<p>You may, for example, wish to look into the initial Soviet claims after capturing Auschwitz (<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/holocaust/wiki/auschwitz-walendy">https://www.reddit.com/r/holocaust/wiki/auschwitz-walendy</a>), where they said they discovered an electrocution conveyor belt, blast furnace, and placed the &quot;gas chambers&quot; on the opposite side of the camp as is now believed. Similarly, at Nuremberg, 19 months after capturing Belzec, the Soviets were still claiming that electrocution was the method of killing there (<a href="http://winstonsmithministryoftruth.blogspot.com/2010/06/electrocuted-to-ashes-at-belzec.html">http://winstonsmithministryoftruth.blogspot.com/2010/06/electrocuted-to-ashes-at-belzec.html</a>). Then there are the infamous &quot;steam chambers&quot; of Treblinka, the human soap and lampshades, shrunken heads, etc -- an enormous number of erroneous and debunked claims which are always omitted by the Holocaust industry.</p>

<p>Similarly, the footage and pictures of dead bodies in the western camps (since debunked as &quot;extermination camps&quot;) are repetitively shown without informing the viewer that they were the result of disease in the last weeks and months of the war, as supplies dwindled with the collapse of the German state under the barrage of Allied bombing. US Army doctors confirmed this at the time (see the article on the liberation of the camps(<a href="http://www.ihr.org/leaflets/libcamps.shtml).">http://www.ihr.org/leaflets/libcamps.shtml).</a>)</p>

<p>Next, regarding links: there&#39;s a giant cache of material at the <a href="/r/holocaust/wiki">/r/holocaust/wiki</a>. I&#39;d recommend starting with a few short videos by a French historian who is about to go back to prison a second time for his research:</p>

<p>Vincent Reynouard: Holocaust? What They Hide From You (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpjqf-vNq6I">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpjqf-vNq6I</a>) (30min)</p>

<p>Vincent Reynouard: Argument 1 - Nothing proven at Nuremberg (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChaMQFkqXyw">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChaMQFkqXyw</a>) (9min)</p>

<p>Vincent Reynouard: Argument 2 - The dishonesty of the official historians (<a href="https://vimeo.com/90766157">https://vimeo.com/90766157</a>) (9min)</p>

<p>Another good introductory video is about the use of the western camps by US psychological warfare units:</p>

<p>Dean Irebodd: Buchenwald - A Dumb Dumb Portrayal of Evil (2009) (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVZ_5yWmBRk">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVZ_5yWmBRk</a>)</p>

<p>This video by Jewish revisionist David Cole is a classic which many credit with opening their eyes to the dishonest presentation of Auschwitz:</p>

<p>David Cole Visits Auschwitz (1992) (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHzWo79dCHs">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHzWo79dCHs</a>)</p>

<p>There are a few articles which are essential introductory reading:</p>

<p>&#39;Extermination&#39; Camp Propaganda Myths (<a href="http://codoh.com/library/document/1170/">http://codoh.com/library/document/1170/</a>)</p>

<p>Liberation of the Camps: Fact vs Fiction (<a href="http://www.ihr.org/leaflets/libcamps.shtml">http://www.ihr.org/leaflets/libcamps.shtml</a>)</p>

<p>The Nuremberg Trials and the Holocaust (<a href="http://codoh.com/library/document/2369/">http://codoh.com/library/document/2369/</a>)</p>

<p>Eye Witness Testimony of Gassings (<a href="http://codoh.com/library/document/969/">http://codoh.com/library/document/969/</a>)</p>

<p>And there&#39;s a short book that is a good starting point also, which is an evaluation of the preeminent Holocaust scholar&#39;s use of evidence:</p>

<p>(pdf) The Giant With Feet of Clay: Raul Hilberg and his Standard Work on the ‘Holocaust’ - Jürgen Graf (<a href="http://holocausthandbooks.com/dl/03-tgwfoc.pdf">http://holocausthandbooks.com/dl/03-tgwfoc.pdf</a>)</p>

<p>You&#39;ll find book-length studies of the various camps, and related topics, in the <a href="/r/holocaust/wiki">/r/holocaust/wiki</a> (<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/holocaust/wiki/index">https://www.reddit.com/r/holocaust/wiki/index</a>).</p>

<p>He was convicted in a court of law and he&#39;s no longer relevant in politics. Somehow that&#39;s supposed to balance out flimsy accusations directed at basically every major player in the Democratic party... and no one affiliated with Trump. </p>

<p>I&#39;m sorry, the fact that a &quot;serial child rapist&quot; (quote from the judge who sentenced him) managed to make it to the level of Speaker of the House, is no longer relevant to you?</p>

<p>I&#39;d still like to know every single politician that wrote letters to the judge on his behalf, defending him as being not a bad guy. What person in their right mind, ESPECIALLY politicians, would stick their neck out to defend a pedophile?</p>

<p>The whole thing just shows how even if there aren&#39;t a large number of pedophiles in the government, there are more than enough people that know about it, and even help these people cover their tracks.</p>

<p>Left or right, I don&#39;t give a fuck, anyone who touches kids, or knows about someone who touches kids and says nothing or tries to help, should be put down like a rabid dog.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This isnt partisanship...not that it even fucking matters. Bush and Clinton were so called partisan, didnt matter a damn. </p>

<p>But what does a cop dubiously promoted and promoted to the highest levels while costing $10&#39;s of millions of tax payer money, filing charges on an 11-yr old girl, abusing his wife, losing his gun, etc, have to do with parties? </p>

<p>Yeah, bipartisanship is ass, it makes every politician fall in line which is ridiculous. It gives false sense of choice, and is divisive to the public. I don&#39;t think &quot;this person is conservative he probably has no social/moral compass&quot; or &quot;this person is a democrat they&#39;re probably some progressive socialist&quot;. </p>

<p>If you&#39;re a critical thinker, idc who you support, as long as you remain skeptical and vigilant. Dems or Republican? If you like Bush or Clinton, go fuck yourself, fuck your partyline.</p>

<p>Basically, she was a drug addict at 11 and a mother at 15. The police said it wasn&#39;t possible to exclude that there was consensual sex, and also that she was very instable and inconsistent in her story. Which is to be expected from an 11yo drug abuser tbh.</p>

<p>Was she indeed raped? Very possibly. But not necessarily provable. The proof required to press charges for rape is pretty substantial. Was there a mishandling of the information? Yes, the department itself admitted so. There is however no proof that that mishandling would be the fault of then-deputy Peter Newsham. It&#39;s funny that this article is trying to tie it to him when the person he replaced was just as involved in this case as he was. The only thing implicating him personally is the opinion of the victims mother. Who, again, is not exactly a stable, reliable source (but Fox omits that detail).</p>

<p>Best’s daughter was raped by multiple men at just 11 years old. Her daughter, who is still emotionally recovering from the 2008 aggression, was charged with filing a false report after her account of events were found to be inconsistent--</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The story could be that they wanted to cash in on the big catch. And later on, it turned out telling the full story would implicate mom as a pimp. That&#39;s the point when they called it a day, even if it&#39;s normally a fairly strong case. Here, have Boondocks (elaborating further)[<a href="http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x1k8vjj_the-boondocks-season-1-episode-2-the-trial-of-robert-kelly_shortfilms?start=690">http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x1k8vjj_the-boondocks-season-1-episode-2-the-trial-of-robert-kelly_shortfilms?start=690</a>]</p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;Furthermore, Danielle’s age at the time of the assaults raises the question of why, when there were two medical reports detailing the sexual injuries she suffered, the police did not at least look into statutory rape charges.&quot;</p>

<p>Are you kidding me?  Your own source invalidates your argument.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The police said it wasn&#39;t possible to exclude that there was consensual sex</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Since when could an 11 year old give legal consent?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>and also that she was very instable and inconsistent in her story</p>
</blockquote>

<p>which the article also states &quot;experts say inconsistent accounts by rape victims are not uncommon but do not mean that rape did not occur&quot; and also &quot;An officer misled her to get her to contradict her account, and then had her charged with lying, according to police reports.&quot;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Was she indeed raped? Very possibly.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No, she was definitely raped, and also as u/DontTreadOnMe16 said, she&#39;s a prime target for abusers because of her situation.</p>

I&#39;m sure it&#39;s shocking news to those who aren&#39;t from the DMV (DC/MD/VA) region, but sex trafficking and politics, unfortunately, go hand in hand here. </p>

<p>I know I don&#39;t have any evidence, but I think Relisha Rudd is one such victim of it and the justice system continues to let her, and other young victims, down. If you aren&#39;t aware of Relisha Rudd, [I did a write up of her a few months back(<a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/UnsolvedMysteries/comments/5b4gxu/what_become_of_8year_old_relisha_rudd/)">https://np.reddit.com/r/UnsolvedMysteries/comments/5b4gxu/what_become_of_8year_old_relisha_rudd/)</a>].

Also when it&#39;s brought up people tend to divert the thread to &quot;but the Clinton&#39;s have heaps of recorded flights, clearly they&#39;re the bad ones&quot; because somehow that invalidates claims against Trump (obviously they can&#39;t BOTH be guilty, right)? </p>

<p>Personally I don&#39;t think there&#39;s enough evidence to say Trump was definitely involved in the shit Epstein was doing but I think it&#39;s likely he knew what was happening but didn&#39;t say anything about it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The quote back in &#39;02 about Epstein liking girls on the younger side suggests Trump might have known before it came to light. Also from what I could find (from James Patterson&#39;s book on Epstein) an incident of Trump kicking Epstein out of his club for coming onto an underage girl happened in &#39;99; 3 years before Trump called Epstein a good friend in that quote; 4 years before Epstein said Trump has dinner at his house; and 9 years before Epstein was charged. Seems like Trump didn&#39;t want to be involved or implicated in Epstein&#39;s crimes but otherwise had no problem with Epstein.</p>

<p>I think Trump&#39;s just smart enough to realise continuing a relationship with Epstein AFTER things came to light is plain bad for business, regardless of whether he condemns or condones Epstein&#39;s actions. Trump understand the importance of image. </p>

<p>Also the Clintons continuing a relationship with Epstein is irrelevant to Trump&#39;s relationship to him. Clintons being shit people doesn&#39;t mean Trump isn&#39;t shit as well. Kind of brings me back to the point before about deflections to Clintons when Trump is brought up. </p>
