        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I believe I have an idea of what the message they are trying to convey is, but as for what the overall statement is, I have no idea. This is what my theory is:</p>

<p>What: The seed part of the seed bank is probably their way of saying they have a secure seed bank to release information via torrent as insurance.</p>

<p>Where: Probably underground, also referring to the information being a gold mine.</p>

<p>When: F-119 could mean February 9th at 11:00 or maybe February 11th at 9:00? Either way, its obviously them saying they&#39;ll release their insurance vault soon. The jet engine also could signify that it will be soon, because of the speeds the engine can reach.</p>

<p>Who: Probably their way of saying they only gave us a fraction of what Assange, Manning, and Snowden turned over.</p>

<p>Why: Now this the tricky part. Could be something to do with the Iraq war because the B2 bombers carried out the first strikes, or it could be a message that we aren&#39;t meant to know. I think its pretty clearly their way of giving someone a message, threatening to release the insurance information. Now the question is, what happens next?</p>

<p>When: The third tweet shows a picture of a Pratt &amp; Whitney F119 airplane engine, which is the engine for the Lockheed Martin F-22 Raptor. The picture in the tweet was taken on April 9th, 2010 at Langley Air Force Base as part of a story published on April 12th about the soundproof &quot;hush houses&quot; used for jet engine testing.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What does it matter?  Honestly it doesn&#39;t matter what information is there because it will only reach those who are wanting to see it.  There aren&#39;t enough people out there that believe our government is capable of anything other than what has become &quot;normalized&quot; corruption in the political world.  This is why the 9-11 conspiracy has gone nowhere but dark channel discussion.  Does the evidence suggest that 9/11 wasn&#39;t planes flying into buildings....absolutely.  Do people WANT to believe our government is capable of killing thousands of innocents for whatever reason...NOPE....</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I wish someone would put all the tweets together in one line, without nonsense speculation. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t know how people come up with so many terrible speculations about what these things mean. Really, a jet engine is to mean 9/11 or some other date. That is just terrible. Vault7 has to do with WTC7? That is terrible too. People need to take their tunnel vision blinders off. Maybe if all the tweets without misleading stuff are stacked in one image, it would be more clear.</p>
