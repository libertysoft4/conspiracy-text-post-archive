        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p><strong>FOREWARD:</strong>I wrote this post in another thread but wanted to post it for more casual readers. Those who haven&#39;t been following pizzagate and may be intimidated by the idea of &quot;catching up on it&quot; (don&#39;t be). Recently, Glenn Beck posted very detailed information regarding a record breaking child-sex-trafficking operation <strong>two hours before the bust went down.</strong></p>

<p>In my post I&#39;ll expand on what I think that means, and the role I imagine Glenn Beck has been tasked with. I may be wrong. I ask you still read the post. Take the overall meaning. Elites with illegal ties to PG have either put Beck in the position I suspect him to be in, or they will put someone in this position eventually. Please remember, <strong>if not Beck, somebody.</strong>  Whatever your God is, God bless you guys. Original post follows. </p>

<p>I think Beck has been chosen, by the major players involved, to be a dealer of red herrings. </p>

<p>A questionable background of his own, he&#39;s obviously in the loop. He&#39;s got a secret source in the know involved in the trafficking. You might ask whether the source is on the authorities &quot;side&quot;,  or the pedophile traffickers &quot;side&quot;. I remind you that there is likely a lot of overlap between those &quot;sides&quot;.</p>

<p>True LEOs about to bust that case would never be happy with someone leaking a massive record-breaking bust. Beck will have done it with no consequence. Why will LEO not pursue it? Because there was a massive heads up given. All of the high level, high power participants were allowed to withdraw from and cut ties with the group found guilty. For those &#39;in the know&#39;, this thing was expected. LEO knows that many people know, therefore beck can leak it with no hesitation. They all knew that everyone already knew. </p>

<p>After establishing that Beck has some level of involvement or source of insider information, it is easy to plot his course for the future. </p>

<p>He is inside. He will be a mouthpiece for the establishment. The people arrested today were limited hangout. Possible that some aren&#39;t even involved, just patsies with enough information to be indicted on an open/close case. </p>

<p>Beck will continue the crusade as &quot;the mainstream guy who follows all of the sex trafficking stuff&quot;. But he is a plant. A facade, a smokescreen, a limited hangout. He will NOT be truly pursuing any investigation. He is the red herring PR guy for high level offenders of pg.</p>

<p>I believe Glenn Beck is at least a level 17 Free Mason. I put together a lot of research about the theory, and came to that conclusion. This was back when they (The Blaze or w/e) first moved to Texas, though. So, he could be higher now. Point being, I think this may have been a heads up to more of the higher ups down there (ie. other fellow Masons). </p>

<p><strong>An Oath of Allegiance in the Book of Mormon</strong>
Terrence L. Szink

<p>That this oath was taken just as seriously as the biblical one is demonstrated in the

covenant to support the cause of freedom, that they might maintain a free
government, he [Moroni] caused to be put to death; and there were but few who
denied the covenant of freedom&quot; (Alma 46:35). </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Actually, he did exactly what he was trying to do: get the conversation going.</p>

<p>His tweets were so vague that nothing was compromised. Furthermore, that op was well under way if they made the arrests 2 hours later. Surveillance had already been well established, and the whereabouts of their targets was well defined.</p>

<p>Your reddit shitpost will fall on deaf ears while becks tweets gets everyday Americans talking about PG. That is a good thing.</p>

<p>You also realize that it was a private organization that facilitated this bust, and NOT LEOs. You also realize that he is a big part of operation underground railroad, right? Maybe the two are one and the same.</p>

<p>So, not only did Beck probably help facilitate a successful major bust against child trafficking, but he also garnered a ton of attention on the subject, doing it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Divide divide divide. I brought a comment and you brought some negative ass childish comment without any substance to support your theory on Beck being a mason. The anti LDS sentiment is very strong within the Masons. There&#39;s no way a guy who wrote an inspirational book, published by Deseret Books would rise through the ranks of masonry. Do more research before you claim to sit at the &quot;big boys table&quot; or whatever self righteous crap you want to call it. I&#39;d rather sit at the kids table than a table with a retarded people ECE of shit like you who argues their point by saying &quot;Nuh uh, I&#39;m right you&#39;re wrong&quot;</p>

<p>Understand that mormanism is the polar opposite of masonic beliefs in exaltation. Masonry allows self righteous exaltation as to where mormanism believes that only through Jesus Christ, will any soul be saved. Mormons bring women into the ordinances...Etc etc etc.</p>

<p>The Utah lodge is basically defunct, and not a powerful body of masonry, as it has been polluted by mormanism...Your level 17 research should lead you into the inner workings of the secret society within the secret society.</p>

<p>Don&#39;t act like a dick. You don&#39;t sit at a better table than me. You aren&#39;t &quot;more woke.&quot; With your self righteous attitude, I could infer that you are a level 7 mason, and a level 90 douchebag.

I don&#39;t know much about how law enforcement works in Haiti specifically, but I&#39;m quite familiar with it in Latin American countries of similar development and I can tell you with certainty that they would not have forward surveillance.

    <div class="md"><p>Nothing I&#39;ve read has indicated that there was any violent resistance, and that there was several inside informants. It very well could have been determined that there was no threat to the safety of any operators, victims, or the operation, by releasing the tweet. You are assuming that these degenerate low level henchmen of child traffickers (that is who was busted...) are glued to their Twitter feeds, following Glen Beck, waiting for him to tweet about busting up your hustle.

And while, sure, it&#39;s probably not likely that anyone was checking twitter, it isn&#39;t altogether unlikely, either.  It was reported that US missionaries were involved.  They would reasonably have the technology and fit the demo to notice it, or even someone outside the immediate circle notices it and gives them the heads up.  Bottom line is: You don&#39;t ever pull the shit he did, ever.  If this operation took place in the US there would be hell to pay, and rightfully so.  It&#39;s basic, 101-level, SOP to keep a lid on shit.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There is no SOP for black ops in Haiti. Again, the team very well could have been utilizing the tweets for getting another lead by any fleeing targets, or it was determined that it was inconsequential to the op..Or the tweet wasn&#39;t even prior to the op, at all. The tweets did nothing to compromise the operation. The only soup sandwich is reddit and their perception of a successful operation that netted a dozen arrests, the freeing of a few dozen girls, and a computer that will potentially lead to more arrests, and saving of other victims. Rather than welcoming success, this echo chamber of skeptics are searching for negativity in a very positive situation. Beck got everyday people&#39;s attention to the topic. Mission accomplished. Question everything, yes...but don&#39;t demonize the people who are making monumental progress in this subject. The &quot;don&#39;t trust Beck&quot; message has shill all over it.

<p>So now pizzagate is just a euphemism for kiddie fucking?  No.  Pizzagate at very least needs to include a cabal of D.C. bigwigs, but, frankly, if you&#39;re backing off the Pizza Comet thing being part of it you&#39;re really admitting the whole thing was imagined from the start.  </p>

<p>Do I believe that there are household name politicians that are involved in child trafficking?  Sure.

No.  And the reason I don&#39;t believe that is because the narrative presented is absolutely forced and unconvincing.  I would love to believe it, it would perfectly fit my own confirmation bias, but the &quot;evidence&quot; often cited here is fucking laughable.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, not really backing off the Comet Ping Pong aspect, personally. Then again, it&#39;s not like I&#39;m sitting on information that anybody else hasn&#39;t seen. </p>

<p>Pizzagate is not a euphemism for kiddy fucking. You can ask someone to clarify their opinion if you&#39;d like, it might save you the effort or attempting to create it for them. But it&#39;s all good. </p>

<p>Since you asked, I will explain what I consider pizzagate in a way that hopefully at least allows you to see another perspective on it regardless of whether you agree with me - I&#39;m just a dude who uses the internet, afterall.</p>

<p>Pizzagate is worldwide sex trafficking. It is likely that when it comes to such large scale trafficking, the rings and their economies likely have a lot of overlap. CPP is likely a small faction of one of the rings that does that overlapping that I was talking about. </p>

<p>At the end of the day, it&#39;s semantics and you&#39;re not arguing anything at all. Raping children is raping children. the perpetrators all deserve to burn in the same fire. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>How is the concept of worldwide sex trafficking any sort of -gate?  It&#39;s not suspected that there might be worldwide sex trafficking, its GIVEN.  It&#39;s a known fact.  For it to be a -gate it needs to be some sort of scandal or specific conspiracy, which is why I asserted that to call it pizzagate it has to include at least one well known politician (which is also all but given, but at least provides a scandal element).  You don&#39;t think it&#39;s odd or silly at all to take something that just recently was coined to specifically refer to a set of named officials and locations and try to apply it to the overarching concept of worldwide sex trafficking once certain aspects are all but proven false?</p>

A few dozen girls saved, a dozen arrests, technology siezed, and you are painting the operatives out to be bad guys. That is a shitpost.

<p>The system in place is a system of blackmail, bribery, and extortion. If you get to host your own syndicated television show on the MSM, it&#39;s safe to assume that you&#39;re in the system (at a low level -- there&#39;s no way TV pundits are privy to anything interesting). </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Beck is probably one of the biggest POS&#39;s amongst a lot of shitty people, for instance:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The animosity between Beck and Kelly continued to deepen. When Beck and Hattrick produced a local version of Orson Welles’ “War of the Worlds” for Halloween — a recurring motif in Beck’s life and career — Kelly told a local reporter that the bit was a stupid rip-off of a syndicated gag. The slight outraged Beck, who got his revenge with what may rank as one of the cruelest bits in the history of morning radio. “<strong>A couple days after Kelly’s wife, Terry, had a miscarriage, Beck called her live on the air and says, ‘We hear you had a miscarriage,’ ” remembers Brad Miller, a former Y95 DJ and Clear Channel programmer. “When Terry said, ‘Yes,’ Beck proceeded to joke about how Bruce [Kelly] apparently can’t do anything right — about he can’t even have a baby.”</strong></p>

    <div class="md"><p>Divide divide divide. I brought a comment and you brought some negative ass childish comment without any substance to support your theory on Beck being a mason. The anti LDS sentiment is very strong within the Masons. There&#39;s no way a guy who wrote an inspirational book, published by Deseret Books would rise through the ranks of masonry. Do more research before you claim to sit at the &quot;big boys table&quot; or whatever self righteous crap you want to call it. I&#39;d rather sit at the kids table than a table with a retarded people ECE of shit like you who argues their point by saying &quot;Nuh uh, I&#39;m right you&#39;re wrong&quot;</p>

<p>Your attitude is not becoming of the adult table, and your message does the same damage as the shills that are paid to disrupt the community. If you are so enlightened, then share your wisdom, rather than pretending you are better than everyone else. Until then, suck my dick.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Even assuming they had established an airtight perimeter I can&#39;t see how what Beck did was OK.  That&#39;s how officers (or contractors) get killed.  What would it have hurt to wait two hours?  He clearly had an inside line on what was going down.  He could have posted his little tweet as the raid went down--still got the scoop, no risk to those involved.</p>
