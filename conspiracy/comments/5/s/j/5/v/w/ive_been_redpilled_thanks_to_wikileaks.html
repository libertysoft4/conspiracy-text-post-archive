        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I know someone is gonna TL;DR this...be warned.</p>

<p>Years ago a friend gave me a copy of the Illuminatus Trilogy.  He told me this stuff was true.  I read it from cover to cover fascinated that someone I thought was intelligent could believe the ridiculous things I&#39;m reading.</p>

<p>It was a very entertaining read.</p>

<p>For years I&#39;ve been pointing and laughing at the tin-foil hat types who believe in chem-trails, moon landing hoaxes (still haven&#39;t been convinced that was faked), and a global &quot;cabal&quot; of wealthy elites in control.</p>

<p>Then Wikileaks published John Podesta&#39;s and HRCs emails.</p>

<p>Things my skeptical mind had refused to believe in my 44 years on this planet because they seemed so far-fetched and ludicrous turned out to be true.</p>

<p>I started lurking on <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>.</p>

<p>I read about project MK/Ultra and Paperclip as well as others (Gulf of Tonkin and the CIA plot to commit domestic acts of terrorism and blame Cuba as an excuse for invasion to name a few) and I was completely red-pilled.</p>

<p>My boss is already a conspiracy guy but with a skeptical mind like me.  When we started comparing notes I looked at him and said, &quot;You know if I had this conversation with myself a year ago I&#39;d have bought me a roll of Reynolds Wrap and called myself and idiot.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I know, right!&quot; he replied.</p>

<p>After my own research, through my skeptic filter, I&#39;ve determined there is an enormous amount of truth in the conspiracies I&#39;ve made fun of my friends for over the years.</p>

<p>So...what I ask the community to point me in the right direction to  apply my own autism to some good conspiracies and plots.</p>

<p>I&#39;ll give you something of my own that I found out from a good friend (he told me this right after Snowden leaked his info).</p>

<p>George was dating a girl who claimed to work for the NSA.  Her job was to listen part of every cell phone call the agency intercepted.  Apparently the NSA intercepts random cell phone calls and has (or had) a call center where available employees listen in on the first 20 seconds.  If she hears something potentially criminal or suspicious she would press a button and the rest of the call would be recorded, processed and archived.</p>

<p>She helped me through her connections helped me confirm my suspicions a few months later that my now ex-wife was cheating on me.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes it is.  </p>

<p>The DNC, HRC, and Podesta emails showed that there is A LOT of truth the &quot;Vast Global Cabal&quot; of wealthy elites using politics and money to keep the population placated while they keep control and rake in disgusting amounts of money at our expense.</p>

<p>I used to laugh at that shit until I read the emails.  Its un-deniable now.  And its not just me.  Lots of people are seeing it.  Its a discussion that comes up at bars now.  Family members are talking about it.</p>

<p>All people who would have laughed at this sub 6 months ago.  Now we&#39;re reading it.  We&#39;re googling the source of the conspiracy.  We&#39;re finding the declassified </p>

</blockquote>

<p>I also think those leaks showed that many of the people in power are often downright fucking stupid and too arrogant to take good advice.<br/>
They were given instructions on internet security, which they ignored, and clearly failed to hire IT specialists to keep their communications safe, or contracted the work out to <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/53j96v/computer_specialist_who_deleted_clinton_emails/">people who post on Reddit</a> for &quot;help&quot;!  </p>

<p>What&#39;s been exposed here, shows that the people in power aren&#39;t superior to us in any way, except they have money ... the tide is turning, and if <em>they</em> can&#39;t BUY a boat, they are <strong>screwed</strong>!</p>

<p>Fuck mass surveillance. When George told me about his girlfriend&#39;s job I was horrified.  Basically you could say, &quot;I was at a party the other night and some guy was selling coke&quot; and now you have a phone call archived with the NSA.  No thanks.  Want no part of that.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah the guy that gave it to me believed in it like it was his Bible.</p>

<p>And on some conspiracy sites (and some on this sub I&#39;ve noticed) completely believe it or some variation.  Its hilarious to see someone actually quoting the book.</p>

<p>The theme of it tho turns out to be correct.  There are those in control who are shaping future events to their own benefit at the expense of the populace.  That&#39;s whats scary.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Welcome aboard, OP. You are in the boat of independent thinkers now ;) The best way powers-that-be discredit conspiracy facts is they caricature those who expose them. People then dismiss the claims based on identification reflexes. They rarely attack the message, merely the messengers.</p>

<p>I urgently recommend <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Road_to_Serfdom">The Road to Serfdom</a>, by Friedrich von Hayek. I would do it dishonour if I tried to summarize it. It is a masterpiece, Hayek&#39;s magnum opus, the indispensable foundation to understand the tyranny in its proper context. <a href="https://mises.org/sites/default/files/Road%20to%20serfdom.pdf">Here it is in PDF.</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>not really conspiracy stuff in of itself more of a bit of research to frame why the &quot;elites&quot; buy in to some of the out there cult like stuff</p>

<p>read some Aleister Crowley (specifically look at the book of the law) crowley was a big figure for a lot of the &quot;elite&quot; and a lot of the things he was delving in to are the basis for these ceremonies, he dovetailed with the freemasons and is tied in to all of the illuminatti stuff. </p>

<p>imho you need to be at least aware of their beliefs to understand  the motivations and thought processes of these people.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes it is.  </p>

<p>The DNC, HRC, and Podesta emails showed that there is A LOT of truth the &quot;Vast Global Cabal&quot; of wealthy elites using politics and money to keep the population placated while they keep control and rake in disgusting amounts of money at our expense.</p>

<p>I used to laugh at that shit until I read the emails.  Its un-deniable now.  And its not just me.  Lots of people are seeing it.  Its a discussion that comes up at bars now.  Family members are talking about it.</p>

<p>All people who would have laughed at this sub 6 months ago.  Now we&#39;re reading it.  We&#39;re googling the source of the conspiracy.  We&#39;re finding the declassified </p>
