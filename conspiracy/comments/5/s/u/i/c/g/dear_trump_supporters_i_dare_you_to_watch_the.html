    <div class="md"><p>Who cares, nobody is really pro Trump cabinet.  It&#39;s more like people like him and they&#39;ll just go along with it.</p>

<p>There&#39;s nothing you can do now anyways bit wait 4 years and use your fingers furiously on the keyboard then...  For now you have a new President and that&#39;s how American politics works.   </p>

<p>If the man monumentally screws up then he will be out quicker, these posts pointing out the obvious are just retarded .  If the agenda is to sway someone, it&#39;s too late.  We don&#39;t need Trump videos 100000 times a day posted unless they have some relevance to the suvreddit topic.  </p>

<p>Drain the swamp meant get rid of Democrats, and anyone who opposes Darth Trump.  You just need to understand that and move on respectfully.</p>

<p>YEAH SO WHAT? Who did you vote for? Gary Johnson? WE are going to drain the swamp you mark my words so many in political positions that are guilty of perjury. As for his picks I like them. I am tired of hearing waaaaa this guy used to work for Goldman sachs!!!! GOOD! Maybe he seen the shit they were doing to this country and wants to help Trump take them down. WAAAAAA CEO OF EXXON. Let me tell you something right now if your an American then you better get on your knees and thank the universe Rex is your Secretary of State instead of Hillary or John Kerry. Rex is a powerhouse even more so than Trump and he would DIE before the hair on the head of a citizen gets hurt. </p>

<p>That wasn&#39;t ner point at all. As she said, it&#39;s been a long policy spanning multiple presidencies. She even pointed to the Wesley Clarke statement in 2007 outlining these seven countries planned for war back in the 1990s.</p>

<p>So is Trump to blame for continuing this policy? One Clinton would have pursued just the sane? No. But you&#39;re the dupe who can&#39;t see his obvious nakedness. </p>
