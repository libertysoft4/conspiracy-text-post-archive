The beast system survives.. to be powered on every few thousand years as humanity rises technologically, before they realize it exists to destroy them, and so worldwide obliteration of all computers and technology will commence again, and we will be thrown back into the dark ages, and the technologies of the past will be held by secret societies until humanity has again evolved enough to understand and reverse engineer those technologies of the ancient world and so it will begin again, and the societies will slowly release the technologies back into the world under false pretense like staged UFO crashes, and we will again believe we have reached a point of technological superiority to all those who have come before us and above all civilizations that have risen in the past as history repeats itself and our collective ego dominates human destiny.  A destiny of doom as we are unable to escape from our human condition.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve tried to find a bit about it myself, though through videos. One was that Atlantis was a continent straight out of the gate of gibraltar, being in the middle of the Atlantic between Europe, South- and North-America. Another video I wanted to see because it talked about Alternative history and spirituality(?, unsure), it said that a large continent, I believe he said that it was atlanis, being around Bermuda and the Bermuda Triangle, but met with disaster and disapeared (not in that it suddely disapeared, more like natural disasters).</p>

<p>The video mentioned lastly, though I don&#39;t believe this any particulary, but I do think it&#39;s interesting.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Some people say that it&#39;s along the Mid-Atlantic Ridge, specifically the Azores plateau. The modern Azores islands would have been considerably larger and above sea level during the Ice Age. This also corresponds to Plato saying it was located outside the Straits of Gibraltar.

    <div class="md"><p>Well the fact that we are still, with modern technology, unable to find proof of the civilization existing should suggest that Plato would have a rather hard time with it as well. If he wasn&#39;t such a renowned storyteller I may have an easier time believing him but there are just no facts. I highly doubt he (and he alone) would have knowledge of a civilization that existed 9,000 years prior.</p>

<p>It just doesn&#39;t line up. The problem I have with conspiracies like these, and the reason I typically play Devil&#39;s Advocate, is that so much of the opinions here are based on anecdotal evidence and lack any scientific bearing. I&#39;m all about ET life, and I believe that there are pedophiles out there who likely murder children and may even drink their blood. That said, without proof it is only and will only ever be a theory. </p>

<p>Some of the shit said here doesn&#39;t even make any sense. That doesn&#39;t mean we should disregard some of the truth out there, though. Think critically, and not just based on what you want to be true.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well the story is that someone plato is related to (I forgot who at this moment) went to egypt and was told the story of a long lost civilization innundated by a catastrophic event (comet impact of 11,600 years ago). It wasnt him and him alone, there was probably more people who knew but hes the one that had a notable quote. I could apply the same thing you said at the end to your self.</p>

<p>There is literally mounds of evidence suggesting an ancient advanced civilization (at least advanced to the point of having 19th century technologies) existed. Gobekli Tepe, water erosion on the sphinx, the tales all around the world of sages who brought the knowledge of agriculture and of a great civilization back to groups of hunters and gatherers. (Quezecoatal, the seven sages, &quot;the gods&quot;, etc)  granted the stories are anecdotal but gobekli tepe is dated to 11,600 years ago, the last time there was rainfall heavy enough to cause the erosion marks on the sphix was 11,600 (+/-  300) years ago. The date given for the sinking of atlantis, 11,600 years ago. When a comet impacted the pacific ocean (granted this is impact is still a theory but it can be inferred from the evidence.) And caused the spike in temperature we see correlating with that time frame. This is also called meltwater pulse 1-b where the polar ice melted rapidly for a second time causing the submergence of many ancient cities lost to the tides. (See coastlines of the Philippines, Japan, India. Many ancient submerged cities can be found there)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I would have been all over this thread had I seen it in time, but I didn&#39;t see it (even though I was looking for threads <strong><em>exactly</em></strong> like this), so I&#39;ll be brief.</p>

<p>Regarding Atlantis, it was very very very very very <strong>very</strong> real, and was indeed a continent. Now with this comet heory, you are almost certainly referring to Graham Hancock and his fingers of the gods book, etc. </p>

<p>I have made a thread and multiple posts going into extreme detail, showing and explaining as much as I possibly can within reason what Atlantis was like, it&#39;s connection to everything today, why and how it was so incredibly advanced (it simply <strong>was</strong> so incredibly advanced), it&#39;s <strong>supreme importance to destroying the elite&#39;s global system of control</strong>, and everything else that is important relating to Atlantis, <strong><em>including why it simply could not, and would not, have been destroyed by a comet or a meteor of any kind.</em></strong></p>

<p>No, Atlantis was <strong>not</strong> destroyed by a comet that broke apart and causes flooding, and I go into extreme detail as to why that could never have ever been the case. This comet theory is conjecture, which means it is a conclusion formed from incomplete and inaccurate information, and uses illusory correlations because Graham Hancock and the &quot;scientists&quot; who have found this &quot;evidence&quot; (I go into what would constitute <strong>actual</strong> evidence in one of the links I will link) have not taken into account <strong>all</strong> of the obvious evidence (this is a hint), they have not made <strong>all</strong> of the connections needed between everything, and they have not used <em>logic</em> to order those connections in the correct sequence to find the actual <strong>objective</strong> truth. I go into how to know the correct sequence in some of my links, and if you go through my posts.</p>

<p>Atlantis is the most important thing anyone could be talking about, especially on this sub, and it is the absolute key to destroying the global system of control of the elite. The elite, as a group, stem from Atlantis and their system had its foundations laid there.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/5jq50l/i_think_some_day_soon_something_about_atlantis/">This</a> is my original thread going into detail about Atlantis and its connection/paramount importance to defeating the elite and their global control system,  well as how advanced Atlantis was, and why and how it was so advanced, and the thread continues in <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/5jq50l/i_think_some_day_soon_something_about_atlantis/dbixn93/">this</a> comment, and in <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/5jq50l/i_think_some_day_soon_something_about_atlantis/dbixo60/?utm_content=permalink&amp;amp;utm_medium=front&amp;amp;utm_source=reddit&amp;amp;utm_name=conspiracy">this</a> comment that continues the first comment. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/5ph62z/is_there_a_lost_city_under_antarctica/dcsf1xr/">This</a> comment goes into Antarctica and simply clarifies why it wouldn&#39;t and couldn&#39;t be Atlantis, and piggy backs off of these other links. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/5jq50l/i_think_some_day_soon_something_about_atlantis/dbkbysz/">This</a> comment goes into Atlantis, the elite, secret societies, and spiritual initiates, all things that are important to understand Atlantis, and how there is a lie that the elite are somehow &quot;spiritually&quot; minded. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/5nmxg4/mysterious_10000_year_old_underwater_ruins_in/dcdga4q/">This</a> comment explains why the &quot;comet&quot; theory of Atlantis&#39; destruction is false and it explains how Atlantis absolutely would have been destroyed, and it also goes into why cyclical rising and lowering of human consciousness is false as well. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/5pf4ep/there_is_a_hidden_knowledge_that_has_been_kept/dcr0nde/">This</a> comment goes into evidence and the insanity of using subjectivity and beliefs to determine reality. Finally, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/5pvb5z/the_musical_conspiracy_to_separate_mankind_from/dcveaxm/">this</a> comment is seemingly unrelated (its about music and the elite), but it goes into detail about God, and why negativity exists, and true spirituality, and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/5pvb5z/the_musical_conspiracy_to_separate_mankind_from/dcveq1h/">this</a> comment continues that first one.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Atlantis was not just a city, nor was it just an island. Since I am late to the party here (I didn&#39;t see this thread until now), I&#39;ll be brief. Atlantis was a continent, located in the <em>Atlantic</em> ocean, and there is obvious evidence for it everywhere, and there are connections between everything that point to Atlantis, and logic that shows and explains why and how it was the way it was.</p>

<p>Atlantis is the most important topic that anyone could be talking about because it is the key to destroying the global system of control, domination, and oppression of the elite. I will not go into all of it here since I missed the critical period of exposure of this thread so I will link my original thread and other posts on Atlantis and everything related to it.</p>

<p>I ask that you read the links regarding Atlantis <em>specifically</em>, in the order that they are linked, and I ask that you read all of the links <em>in detail</em>, and then <strong>reread</strong> them <em>in detail</em> so you can begin to understand and appreciate Atlantis and its supreme importance.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/5jq50l/i_think_some_day_soon_something_about_atlantis/">This</a> is my original thread going into detail about Atlantis and its connection/paramount importance to defeating the elite and their global control system,  well as how advanced Atlantis was, and why and how it was so advanced, and the thread continues in <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/5jq50l/i_think_some_day_soon_something_about_atlantis/dbixn93/">this</a> comment, and in <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/5jq50l/i_think_some_day_soon_something_about_atlantis/dbixo60/?utm_content=permalink&amp;amp;utm_medium=front&amp;amp;utm_source=reddit&amp;amp;utm_name=conspiracy">this</a> comment that continues the first comment. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/5ph62z/is_there_a_lost_city_under_antarctica/dcsf1xr/">This</a> comment goes into Antarctica and simply clarifies why it wouldn&#39;t and couldn&#39;t be Atlantis, and piggy backs off of these other links. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/5jq50l/i_think_some_day_soon_something_about_atlantis/dbkbysz/">This</a> comment goes into Atlantis, the elite, secret societies, and spiritual initiates, all things that are important to understand Atlantis, and how there is a lie that the elite are somehow &quot;spiritually&quot; minded. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/5nmxg4/mysterious_10000_year_old_underwater_ruins_in/dcdga4q/">This</a> comment explains why the &quot;comet&quot; theory of Atlantis&#39; destruction is false and it explains how Atlantis absolutely would have been destroyed, and it also goes into why cyclical rising and lowering of human consciousness is false as well. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/5pf4ep/there_is_a_hidden_knowledge_that_has_been_kept/dcr0nde/">This</a> comment goes into evidence and the insanity of using subjectivity and beliefs to determine reality.

There are a bunch of few thousand year old mounds of heavy rock moved from far away (like the pyramids) into distinct patterns, in America and especially in the Midwest. You can find them if you google ancient American mound builders and go off that. </p>

<p>Theres also a lot of evidence that giant human skeletons were found all around America, stolen by the smithsonian to never be seen again. There are newspaper articles detailing these 7+ foot tall skeletons from the early 20th century in the Grand Canyon, Texas, and other places. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Artifacts are nowhere near as important as ruins themselves. And these ruins exist, and there are <strong>many</strong> of them in the place that Atlantis was, and some have already been found, such as the Bimini Road and <a href="https://youtu.be/s0T-xIOaWBM?t=5m39s">ruins off the coast of the Andros islands</a>, as well as in the Azores.</p>

<p>There are ruins all throughout the Caribbean, Bahamas, Azores, and Atlantic ocean and they are going to be rediscovered, and this subreddit will be the heart of their rediscovery. This subreddit is far more important to changing the world than anyone here could imagine because it is the largest, most organized group of people with the most access on the planet who actively question parts of the narrative and/or system of the elite. </p>

<p>Atlantis is the key to changing the world for the better and destroying the elite&#39;s global system of control, domination, and oppression and this sub is the key to rediscovering Atlantis. </p>

<p>But first, this sub needs to know how Atlantis actually was, why it is so important, its connection to human life today, and everything that leads up to knowing those things and <strong>how</strong> to find out those things.</p>

<p>I have made numerous posts on Atlantis and everything related to it that is important to changing the world and I will link them.</p>

<p>I want to preface that everything that I write is not based in belief because it is based on the 3 main things that objectively allow you to find the <em>actual</em> <strong>objective</strong> truth and those things are:</p>

<p>1.) Taking into account <strong>all</strong> of the obvious evidence.</p>

<p>2.) Making <strong>all</strong> of the connections needed between <em>everything</em>.</p>

<p>3.) Using <strong>logic</strong> to order those connections in the <em>correct sequence</em>.</p>

<p>Those things are not based in subjectivity and enable you to actually <strong>know</strong> the actual truth, because there are not multiple truths regarding the same thing, whatever category that thing might be in, with the exception of certain aspects of subjectivity such as preferences, dislikes, and other things.</p>

<p>Regarding the history of this planet, Atlantis, the nature of reality, etc. there is a <strong><em>singular</em></strong> truth to each of those things. There are not multiple conflicting truths of reality, there are not multiple conflicting truths of Atlantis, and there are not multiple conflicting truths of the history of this planet. </p>

<p>Being able to do those 3 things alone that I mentioned enable you to find much of the actual truth about each of these things, but in regards to the history of this planet, the only thing that matters is Atlantis because there are beings that are constantly visiting this planet in the skies around the world every single day that know <strong><em>FAR</em></strong> more than we do, or even could on our own. They are the ones who will truly inform us of every bit of reality and the history of our planet because these beings (et&#39;s) know these things and are so incredibly, immensely, advanced that once Atlantis is rediscovered and the system of the elite is destroyed, then we as a planet will be propelled back to the level of Atlantis and possibly even greater, all while being a far more diverse and global civilization than even Atlantis was.</p>

<p>Now onto my links, where I show and explain everything as much as I possibly can within reason, all in extreme detail.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, clearly there were more advanced civilizations. The only ones who don&#39;t know this are modern &quot;scientists.&quot; We have hundreds of accounts, from across the world, of an earlier civilization wiped out by a flood. Recent evidence suggest a comet melting ice sheets as the explanation for this flood. </p>

<p>Did they have agriculture and some fairly advanced masonry? Clearly. Did they have flying cars? Probably not.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>the melting of the ice caps from global warming was such that it released enough water to createvthe english channel, so it is quite possible there are cities beneath the waves.</p>

<p>however, massive population centers above the waves would have had to universally cremated their dead, because we just don&#39;t find cemetaries until the end of the mesolithic, about 10,000 years ago, and they remain pretty small up until about 6,000 years ago when eygpt started to take off. before that we just don&#39;t find the bones. this is why it is so hard to piece together our ancient history. typically we have to rely on a single metatarsil or half of a jaw bone. </p>

<p>most of what we know about our cultual history are the beautifully carved flutes and combs and figurines, the beutiful paintings, and the extensive trade routes. if we had had large population centers before 6,000 BCE, we should find more artifacts, and in caches. </p>

<p>the glacial steps we wandered around on for about 190,000 years were very hard to dig in, and it was far too cold above the equator to plant crops, and the only thing that has allowed women to pop out kids every 15 months are the cheap, readily available calories from grains. it takes a lot of calories to get through pregancies, and pregancies cannabalism a mother&#39;s reserves. without grains, ancient civilations would never have been able to get very large. extant hunter gathers have children about 1 every 4 years.</p>

<p>if civilations had sprung up between say the last glacial maximum and the advent of agriculture 8,000 years ago, they would have likely been wiped out by the younger dryas, a 1000 year long cold spell about 13,000 years ago that made the little ice age look like FL in winter. many people of western european descent, esp. mtdna H4, only survived by clinging to the edge of the iberian peninsula.</p>

<p>we are one of the most inbreed species on the plant, which is why race as a biological concept is ridiculous. we have continually been culled by bottleneck events. we are as inbreed as dogs and horses. the only thing more inbred than we are, are cheetahs. this strongly suggests we never had very large populations for most of history.</p>

<p>one thing about us that is comp,etely unique to us in comparison to all other primates is that we are a restless creature. even today people constantly dream of visting distant lands. this suggests we were migratory from aboutvthe time we branched off. our 3 closest relatives, chimps, gorillas, and orangutans, are kucky if the venture a mile from where they were boarn. the only primate who has expanded outward from very far from where it started are macaques, and they have been inching along for 1,000s of years.</p>

<p>i know there is a &quot;history, science, anthropology, paleontology, osteology etc are all lies&quot; contingent. for those there is no posible counter, just as there is no possible counter about the existence of god, or climate change, or a flat earth. people either accept one side or they don&#39;t.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Takes a few observational cycles to align buildings to celestial objects( I cant remember which cycle and how long this cycle is), meaning the gobekli was carved out of tools that are thought to not existed at the time , it would require an understandings of metalurgy, thats a problem.</p>

<p>They used tools(im trying to pull this shit of memory) that werent thought to be possible at the time, a basic understanding of metalurgy takes like 1,000 years (forgot the real numbers, these are just examples) to understand </p>

<p>You apply that to observation of celestial objects, takes a year for the earth to revolve around the sun, Galileo watched the sun for many years just to learn that. </p>

<p>The people of gobekli used powerful tools to build celestial lined structure, thats like 1500 years of collective knowledge accumulation, for a people with no real economy or trade.</p>

<p>If any of you know what im talking about correct them numbers</p>

<p>Atlantis</p>

<p>Egypt</p>

<p>All these great cultures had different tech</p>

<p>Mu had &#39;mental tone&#39;</p>

<p>Atlantis had &#39;crystal Tone&#39;</p>

<p>Egypt had &#39;sound tone&#39;</p>

<p>All three used the world grid.</p>

<p>Before them, in another epoch, there were advanced civilizations who were master tunnel builders, who used &#39;pitch&#39; to communicate.</p>

<p>Since we have barely any traces yet of other epochs, it&#39;s hard to prove this. But there is some info from channelings and psychics about them. </p>

<p>Here is Seth for example describing the tunnel builders:</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Seth was channeled through Jane Roberts in the 60s 70s and 80s. There are many books he dictated through her, and her husband would use a type of shorthand he invented to transcribe the books. I think I have read them all. About 12 or so. Jane also wrote some amazing poetry and books. It all deals with reality creation and psychic abilities.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you take into account the similarities between the stories of native peoples around the world describing the lost of a very advanced society to a great flooding. I forget which native American tribe specifically states this but they claim that Humanity has been through four civilizations or &#39;&#39;worlds&#39;&#39; and this is the fifth.</p>

<p>I&#39;d say it&#39;d make more sense for it to be true, Humanity is not a stagnate species and is bound to reach high levels of civilization at least once every a few thousand years.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Human beings just like ourselves have existed on this planet for at least 150,000 years and quite possibly even as much 250,000 years about which we know virtually nothing at all. </p>

<p>What we know about our past is basically primitive bits and pieces beginning about 10,000 years ago and records that didn&#39;t begin to finally be written down and kept until the advent of writing about 3,500 years ago. Yet, even there, virtually nothing was written about the world and times that preceded that paradigm change.</p>

<p>Time, the elements, and countless destructive battles and wars destroyed much of even that little bit. What needs to understood is that if this current time line began pretty much from scratch and was able to reach where we are now after only a few thousand years how many others lasting even longer and possibly reaching even greater heights before collapsing could have preceded it in all that time bearing in mind that the first rule of history is that all civilizations ultimately fail and fall for there is always something overlooked or missing in the fundamental ideas that they&#39;re founded on that won&#39;t become known until it&#39;s too late and too complicated to adjust the entre structure to accommodate it and yet it can&#39;t continue without it. So that becomes the focus of a new formation that will see a society eventually rebuilt around that and discarding other elements that didn&#39;t previously pan out as planned. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>As a geologist i have a huge problem with the current popular understanding of what made these obvious 4x4 self propelled tracks in a ash layer in central turkey. These tracks from what i can see are hungreds of thousands of years old and its very obvious these were made by something that rolled over it once and it moved itself without the assistance of a beast of burden. There would be something there dug out by their hooves. There isnt and also, the way the axle carves into the side of ash layer. We are looking at evidence of an ancient advanced speices that had vehicles as we know them .</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I would have been all over this thread had I seen it in time, but I didn&#39;t see it (even though I was looking for threads <strong><em>exactly</em></strong> like this), so I&#39;ll be brief.</p>

<p>Regarding Atlantis, it was very very very very very <strong>very</strong> real, and was indeed a continent. Now with this comet heory, you are almost certainly referring to Graham Hancock and his fingers of the gods book, etc. </p>

<p>I have made a thread and multiple posts going into extreme detail, showing and explaining as much as I possibly can within reason what Atlantis was like, it&#39;s connection to everything today, why and how it was so incredibly advanced (it simply <strong>was</strong> so incredibly advanced), it&#39;s <strong>supreme importance to destroying the elite&#39;s global system of control</strong>, and everything else that is important relating to Atlantis, <strong><em>including why it simply could not, and would not, have been destroyed by a comet or a meteor of any kind.</em></strong></p>

<p>No, Atlantis was <strong>not</strong> destroyed by a comet that broke apart and causes flooding, and I go into extreme detail as to why that could never have ever been the case. This comet theory is conjecture, which means it is a conclusion formed from incomplete and inaccurate information, and uses illusory correlations because Graham Hancock and the &quot;scientists&quot; who have found this &quot;evidence&quot; (I go into what would constitute <strong>actual</strong> evidence in one of the links I will link) have not taken into account <strong>all</strong> of the obvious evidence (this is a hint), they have not made <strong>all</strong> of the connections needed between everything, and they have not used <em>logic</em> to order those connections in the correct sequence to find the actual <strong>objective</strong> truth. I go into how to know the correct sequence in some of my links, and if you go through my posts.</p>

<p>Atlantis is the most important thing anyone could be talking about, especially on this sub, and it is the absolute key to destroying the global system of control of the elite. The elite, as a group, stem from Atlantis and their system had its foundations laid there.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/5jq50l/i_think_some_day_soon_something_about_atlantis/">This</a> is my original thread going into detail about Atlantis and its connection/paramount importance to defeating the elite and their global control system,  well as how advanced Atlantis was, and why and how it was so advanced, and the thread continues in <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/5jq50l/i_think_some_day_soon_something_about_atlantis/dbixn93/">this</a> comment, and in <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/5jq50l/i_think_some_day_soon_something_about_atlantis/dbixo60/?utm_content=permalink&amp;amp;utm_medium=front&amp;amp;utm_source=reddit&amp;amp;utm_name=conspiracy">this</a> comment that continues the first comment. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/5ph62z/is_there_a_lost_city_under_antarctica/dcsf1xr/">This</a> comment goes into Antarctica and simply clarifies why it wouldn&#39;t and couldn&#39;t be Atlantis, and piggy backs off of these other links. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/5jq50l/i_think_some_day_soon_something_about_atlantis/dbkbysz/">This</a> comment goes into Atlantis, the elite, secret societies, and spiritual initiates, all things that are important to understand Atlantis, and how there is a lie that the elite are somehow &quot;spiritually&quot; minded. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/5nmxg4/mysterious_10000_year_old_underwater_ruins_in/dcdga4q/">This</a> comment explains why the &quot;comet&quot; theory of Atlantis&#39; destruction is false and it explains how Atlantis absolutely would have been destroyed, and it also goes into why cyclical rising and lowering of human consciousness is false as well. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/5pf4ep/there_is_a_hidden_knowledge_that_has_been_kept/dcr0nde/">This</a> comment goes into evidence and the insanity of using subjectivity and beliefs to determine reality. Finally, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/5pvb5z/the_musical_conspiracy_to_separate_mankind_from/dcveaxm/">this</a> comment is seemingly unrelated (its about music and the elite), but it goes into detail about God, and why negativity exists, and true spirituality, and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/5pvb5z/the_musical_conspiracy_to_separate_mankind_from/dcveq1h/">this</a> comment continues that first one.</p>
