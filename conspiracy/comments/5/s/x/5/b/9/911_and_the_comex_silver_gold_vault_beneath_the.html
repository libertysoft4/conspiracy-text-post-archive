        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><ul>
<li><p><a href="http://911research.wtc7.net/wtc/evidence/gold.html">WTC basement reportedly housed vaults with at least $650 million of silver and gold pre-9/11</a> (but the true value of stored gold was kept secret following 1993 bombing)</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://nymag.com/news/9-11/10th-anniversary/gold/">Roughly $200 million of gold &amp; silver (2001 prices) publicly reported after ground zero clean-up</a></p></li>
</ul>

<p>So:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><a href="http://www.mintpressnews.com/fema-investigator-claims-world-trade-center-vault-contents-emptied-attack/218111/">According to (somewhat sketchy) report of FEMA employee tasked with filming ground zero, vault was emptied prior to attack</a> </p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2001/11/01/nyregion/a-nation-challenged-the-vault-below-ground-zero-silver-and-gold.html">Vault doors reportedly appeared to have blowtorch &amp; crowbar markings after attack</a></p></li>
<li><p>Reports (<a href="http://www.nydailynews.com/archives/news/cache-gold-found-wtc-truckloads-retrieved-tunnel-rubble-article-1.917973">1</a>, <a href="http://911research.wtc7.net/cache/wtc/evidence/timesonline_gold.html">2</a>) that gold was found loaded onto a crushed truck and recovered from WTC delivery tunnel (was being transported on morning of 9/11).</p></li>
</ul>

<p>So with all this vault talk from wikileaks I wanted to revisit this 9/11 detail... Is several hundred million dollars worth of gold missing? And if so who made off with it?</p>

<p>Hopefully somebody on here knows more about this than I do (I haven&#39;t watched &#39;Loose Change&#39; which apparently deals with this theory). Or about the story of Kurt Sonnenfeld.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is old. There&#39;s like a half a dozen reasons for the attack. The vault, the destruction of pentagon money laundering records, the laws locking down opposition in the US, the mass spending to enrich the coffers of the weapons manufacturers, the federal contractors, and the ability to hand over assets to oil companies at discount prices....not to mention preserve the petrodollar. </p>

<p>Yep that&#39;s correct; it happened in 2001, and there are likely to be several reasons (or motives) for the attack.</p>

One of the reasons I believe it was not an attack it was planned by someone and used to cover up several things.... building 7 was destroyed to cover up/destroy records for some investigation(I forget what it was). And the owner took out an unusual insurance policy on the buildings and got double the payout.</p>
