<h1><strong>The Delta Project and child sex rings:</strong></h1>

<p> </p>

<p>In the late 1960’s and early 1970s John D. Norman was actively attempting to create networks of child sex trafficking rings around the US. He first set up a ring in Dallas known as the “The Odyssey Foundation” and then another in San Diego known as “The Conquest Agency”. According to Chicago police Norman also ran organizations called “The Norman Foundation”, and “Epic International”. Norman was also likely connected to the “Guyon Society” a pedophile organization founded in Europe whose members believed in establishing regular sexual contact with children prior to eight years of age.  </p>

<p>Norman was first arrested in Texas, and police seized a card-file index of 30,000 contacts including victims and clients of the sex ring. It was implied that many of the contacts were politicians, clergy, and millionaires. Dallas PD sent the card index to the State Department for investigation but The State Department rejected the evidence claiming &quot;the cards were not relevant to any fraud case concerning a passport&quot;. The State Department destroyed the entire 30,000 card index. The State Departments lawyer Matthew Nimitz could not explain why the cards were only looked at as a passport issue, nor why they were not forwarded to FBI or postal inspectors.  </p>

<p>After charges were levied against Norman in Texas, he fled to Chicago where he formed “The Delta Project”. His vision for this organization was expanding upon a network of child sex slaves across the US who could be called to service men when needed. His plan involved establishing “dormitories” designed to house three to four children and monitored by one or more adults. It’s unclear how far Norman got in his plans before being arrested by Chicago police in 1973 however Chicago PD said Norman’s ring was active in Chicago, Dallas, and Los Angeles. </p>

<p> </p>

<p><strong>According to a congressional hearing;</strong><br/>
<em>Senator Culver; Would you describe this project, how it works?</em>  </p>

<p><em>Mr.Lehman; He sends out material and receives material from other agencies similar to his, which invites men to – well, one program is called the Don program. In this program, he invites anyone who is willing to have a cadet, which is a young boy between the age of 13 and 19 right in there, to have him live in his house, he will take – a don should take one to three cadets to live with him in his house. He would pay a fee of $50 a month for having these cadets live in his house. But at the same time, these cadets would not only serve him sexually, but would also – any other members of the Delta Project, which is quite vast, would contact these dons and he could invite them for a weekend and these people would in turn pay him for letting them use his facilities, his house and the youth. And John Norman would get a percentage of this back.</em>    </p>

<p> </p>

<p>Upon his arrest by Chicago police, authorities discovered a new list of 5000 clients, contacts and subscribers to Norman’s self-published pedophile magazine entitled “Hermes”. It was one of three boy-love newsletter published in the US at the time. The other two were “Better Life Monthly” (California) and “Broad Street Journal” (Colorado).  </p>

<p>Norman somehow continued to publish the magazine while in jail, and he also enlisted the help of Philip Paske, an inmate he met while in prison. Paske was released prior to Norman and Paske took up publication of Hermes. The Chicago Tribune eventually discovered that Paske was employed by the City of Chicago as a local swimming pool attendant. </p>

<h2>Notes of interest:</h2>

<ul>
<li>Dallas police suspected that Norman was trafficking victims to serial killer Dean Corll.</li>
<li>Delta Project may also have trafficked children to serial killer John Wayne Gacy. 3 checks were paid to Paske from Gacy’s construction company for unknown services.</li>
<li>Gacy claims some of the victims found in his home were not killed by him. “He insisted that other people had murdered victims in his house while he was out of town.”</li>
<li>Norman was re-convicted of molestation 1988 and of child porn distribution in 1995 and 1998. At 81 years old he was released from prison in 2008 in San Diego.</li>
<li>Paske (now dead) was suspected of murdering 3 teenage boys one of whom was to testify against Norman in court. </li>
<li>Delta Project is suspected to have provided children to men traveling off-shore, possibly taking children on trips to Europe.</li>
<li>May 16 (pg.8), 1977 Chicago Tribune article contains an early reference to &quot;Chickens&quot;, or young male prostitutes.<br/></li>
</ul>

<p> </p>

<hr/>

<h2>My Theories;</h2>

<ul>
<li>A Delta Δ is a Greek letter shaped like a triangle. This may be the proto-beginnings of the now famous pedo-symbol in the declassified FBI document.</li>
<li>Gacy, Corll, Norman, and Paske may have been instrumental in forming the early stages of the modern child sex networks. The sale and murder of children, and movement of housing may have beenl in formative stages created by Norman and later ironed out and cleaned up by later adopters of the program.</li>
</ul>
