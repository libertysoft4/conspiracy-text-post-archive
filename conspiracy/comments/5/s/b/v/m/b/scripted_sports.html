    <div class="md"><p>The Baltimore lights got me for sure was my straw. For me, as a Steelers fan, I was suspicious about Jerome Bettis&#39; final season. A &quot;Cinderella story&quot; it would be. So many questionable holding penalties and such that entire season. But you know what&#39;s good for ratings, a Cinderella story. Then the Baltimore lights. Harbaugh vs Harbaugh, wait one team is destroying the other, kill the lights, momentum shift, other team makes a 3rd 4th quarter comeback.

Okay, so they&#39;re professional so it&#39;s different, I get it. But when your team is on fire and something happens to make you pause and relax, and the other team just happens to rally together. There&#39;s something to it regardless of what level your at.  It just boils down to how disciplined your team is to overcome it. </p>

<p>This isn&#39;t serious right? LeBron&#39;s mother was 16 years old and they bounced from house to house until she sent him to live with a coach when he was 8.

<p>If you fail a drug test then you arent doing it right. Olympians, pro sports players, pro body builders take steroids (most) and are &quot;drug tested&quot;. </p>

<p>Even Serena Williams is suspect and IIRC she was almost caught (her friend was caught tho). Point is that the current urine test is ineffective. If they really wanted to regulate steroids they would implement carbon testing.</p>

<p>Are you aware of gambling? Do you know how lines work? Do you know where they are even created from?</p>

<p>You&#39;re in r/conspiracy aren&#39;t you? would it not be such a blasphemous idea that every now and then someone might be told to throw a certain pitch at a certain position over the plate in a certain moment of the game for a certain amount of money or benefits?</p>

<p>These dudes are paid millions of dollars to be able to throw in exact positions according to the exact hot and cold zones of the very hitters they are throwing to. </p>

<p>It&#39;s not that hard of a concept. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I know exactly how Vegas lines work and how they&#39;re created. I also know that there is a whole lot of incentive for Vegas to get their lines as accurate as possible so that there is betting on both sides of the line, otherwise, they stand to lose much more money.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not denying that it&#39;s possible for a game to be thrown. It certainly is and has absolutely happened. But, your initial argument was that it&#39;s SO easy for a baseball player to hit a tiny fucking ball out of a park when it&#39;s being thrown 90+ mph a foot from their bodies. It&#39;s arguably the hardest feat to accomplish in any sport, and your argument is minimizing the sport.</p>

<p>They get paid millions of dollars every year to play baseball. What is the incentive for them to potentially ruin that income FOREVER by getting caught throwing a game? Pete Rose got caught betting on himself essentially and his name is forever tarnished because he got caught. He will probably never get inducted into the Hall of Fame because of it, which he very much deserves to do and have heard him in interviews saying that he would take it back if he could. There is a lot of pride in the game of baseball.</p>

<p>In this technological age where every single play, pitch, throw is more heavily scrutinized than the previous, I would be very confident in saying that your initial claim of 15-20% of the game being rigged is such a gross overstatement and again, diminishes the game itself for what to me seems like crying conspiracy for the sake of crying conspiracy.</p>

<p>There is too much on the line for the players, teams, owners and the MLB as a whole to risk throwing a game for MAYBE a couple more million dollars that they could be making in advertising contracts anyway. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Here: if you&#39;re a baseball fan, you&#39;d remember this from this last season. </p>

<p>This is beautifully rigged. It&#39;s a given home run. Not saying the pitcher was paid to do this or even told to, but the moment is just too easy. It&#39;s a feel good moment for fans and the sport and the media attention that goes along with it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I watched that play happen live, and it was certainly all too perfect.</p>

<p>But look at Dee Gordon&#39;s career stats</p>

<p><a href="http://www.fangraphs.com/statss.aspx?playerid=8203&amp;amp;position=2B/SS">http://www.fangraphs.com/statss.aspx?playerid=8203&amp;amp;position=2B/SS</a></p>

<p>The guy has less than 20 career home runs. He isn&#39;t a power hitter at all, and hit it in one of the hardest parks to hit a home run in. Even if the pitch was grooved perfectly down the plate, it&#39;s still not an easy feat to accomplish. </p>

<p>Whose to say that he didn&#39;t go up to the plate with his adrenaline pumping after one of his teammates just passed away tragically, and thought to himself, I&#39;m going to swing as hard as I&#39;ve ever swung at the very first pitch. </p>

<p>In my opinion that&#39;s much more likely than the pitch being grooved on purpose. </p>

<p>Also, what do you know about pitch counts? Some pitchers want to get ahead in the count as early as possible and many batters tend to not swing at the first pitch either. </p>

<p>There are a lot of variables involved in baseball and I think it diminishes the game when rare feats are accomplished and it&#39;s chalked up to it being rigged.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>In baseball, the rigging happens with the losing team, not the winners. You either make an error on defense, or the pitcher serves up an easy home run ball. Baseball is probably the easiest to script because of routine errors. Makes me wonder if Buckner got paid to miss that ball in &#39;86.  The Chicago White Sox actually did throw the World Series in 1919. </p>

<p>This is pretty damn detailed, but basically a few white sox players accepted money from gangsters and gamblers like Arnold Rothstein to throw the game. Mainly, starting pitchers purposefully giving up runs in the early and middle innings of games.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Now I know this is professional baseball we&#39;re talkin about and they might have some fancy machines, but the pitching machines I know of are insanely consistent in how they throw the ball. When you know how fast the ball is gonna be going and where it&#39;s gonna go before it is even released, hitting it perfectly is just a matter of muscle memory. When you get a human pitcher who can change aim, speed, and pitch types at will, and suddenly hitting the ball can become a challenge.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not saying sports aren&#39;t scripted. I&#39;m just addressing this particular argument you&#39;ve made and how I don&#39;t feel it is very convincing.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Someone with a law degree does give a shit about semantics.  Don&#39;t forget, I am very smart.  </p>

<p>If you said Democracy but meant Republic, then that is fine.  It is not a big deal, but there is a difference.  Fascists are in control of the US government anyways, so it does not matter.  The whole democracy, republic, land of the free home of the brave bullshit is so we do not see the true nature of the fascists in control (see below).  </p>

<p><strong>&quot;They&#39;re both miserably flawed systems which have no business governing people.&quot;</strong>  What?  What is this?  My goodness.  We actually agree on something.  Holy fucking shit.  You are right!  </p>

<p>You never answered my question from before.  Did you watch that video?  I can point you to more, but your view of reality will change dramatically.  </p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW2U5L17lDQ&amp;amp;t=1s">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW2U5L17lDQ&amp;amp;t=1s</a></p>

<p>I do not think I am smarter than others.  I do think I am better informed than most because I spend a lot of time reading and looking things up.  </p>

<p>Watch that video above and see how it affects your view of reality.  </p>

<p>Then watch this video:  </p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTLgeMqjKAs">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTLgeMqjKAs</a></p>

<p>How does it make you feel now that you are more knowledgeable?  </p>

<p>Isn&#39;t it an insult to everyone&#39;s intelligence to let George HW Bush do the coin toss when you know his true nature?  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I barely watched the game as I didn&#39;t care for either team. The Super Bowl is an excuse for friends/family to get together, have good food, and have fun. That&#39;s what I did. I&#39;m gonna take a guess and say you don&#39;t do that a whole lot. </p>

<p>No, my team didn&#39;t win because I didn&#39;t care about who won. Lastly, about Bush, I don&#39;t even like him. He was a mediocre president whose son was 100x worse than he was. I don&#39;t care that he did the coin toss, most people don&#39;t. Despite all of this, he wasn&#39;t even that horrible of a person. I can think of lots of people who were more reprehensible than him and they&#39;ve been showered with honors. I&#39;m not sure why you have a vendetta out on him. </p>

<p>You need to calm down dude, the massive amount of pretentiousness in you is ridiculous. Do you not see that? Why are you so angry about a football game? I kinda feel bad for you.</p>

<p>I would think that people would want to know that it could possibly be true so they can make an informed decision during the election.  When people vote, they have no idea if the person they are voting for likes to have sex with underage children.  I have never heard a candidate being asked this question.  We assume the answer is no, but that is not always the case.  </p>

<p>Do you really want to vote someone into office who enjoys sex with underage children?  It happens all the time, but the voters are not aware.  </p>

<p>Of course, there are many instances in which the politician was not convicted of anything.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah...  It is better not to know the evil of the world.  Life is much more enjoyable that way.  </p>

<p>Did you see George HW Bush at the Super Bowl?  There is a picture of him there with Barbara Bush (I just looked it up, and he did the coin toss.  LOL.  Great!  Hahahahaha!!!  The American public is so duped.  <a href="http://www.today.com/news/george-h-w-bush-barbara-bush-get-big-welcome-super-t107805">http://www.today.com/news/george-h-w-bush-barbara-bush-get-big-welcome-super-t107805</a>).  </p>

<p>Look it up, then watch this video.  </p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW2U5L17lDQ">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW2U5L17lDQ</a></p>

<p>So.... if you are aware of these things and you are watching the game and see George HW Bush on the TV, then it is kind of a downer.  Especially because they will say all of these great and wonderful things about him.   </p>

<p>I make people aware, so then people think there is something wrong with me.  LOL.  </p>

<p>I have an idea for next year&#39;s Super Bowl coin toss.  Have Jerry Sandusky walk out there with a bunch of underage boys.  He can then take them back to the locker room and do his thing until halftime.  I will complain about it, and you can accuse me of being a massive killjoy.  Deal?</p>

<p>Im saying if someone thinks this game was decided in penalties they either don&#39;t understand football or they weren&#39;t watching the game. It&#39;s really that simple. </p>

<p>It&#39;s like saying the the reason the patriots won is because they do better in cold weather than Atlanta. While that is a true statement, it was played in Houston so that cold weather advantage did not factor in because it wasn&#39;t freezing there. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Holding and PI calls are so precarious in a single game, and from game to game--no two games are called the same. I think the way those two penalties are handled are enough of a &quot;control&quot; to keep a game relatively in check so to speak. I&#39;m not saying games are controlled by a kicker missing a kick on purpose because the mafia got to him or something---I&#39;m talking about adjusting the way the refs call a game based on the style of the respective teams playing as way to create an imperfect, amorphous border to the competition. Its not perfect, its not always the case, and it may not always work. Its like a shepherd guiding a flock of sheep using the staff and stone of yellow flags to maintain limits and boundaries. </p>

<p>For instance most of us are totally fine when in one game the refs call a tough game and &quot;let the boys play&quot; as long as its consistent. The thing is, letting the DB&#39;s man-handle WR&#39;s at the line when games normally aren&#39;t called like that is enough to destroy an offense&#39;s entire chemistry, timing, gameplan etc. I think I&#39;ve seen it happen a fair amount of times. New England is ENTIRELY a timing based team. Tom was hot garbage out there with too much pressure and tight coverage... yes he played through adversity, yes there was a meltdown aspect and lucky plays... but come on... that holding call on Atlanta as they were driving just gutted them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It can be loosely scripted. After all if most the players think the game is for real they will make for a better show.</p>

<p>I admit I tune out all sports now but back in the day, when I quit football, I remember the patriots scandal getting caught with playbooks from other teams they stole. Knew every call and plan the opposite team would use.  Probably handed to them so we could have &quot;Patriots won superbowl&quot; drums to war.</p>

I saw it a handful of times and immediately knew it was going to be a mirror of the election.  I told my friends at work this and they scoffed. They came up to me around halftime and were like patriots are down so far. I repeated to them that it was going to be an upset just like in the election.  They laughed in my face.  Then a couple hours go by and they came up to me one by one and were like &quot;how the fuck did you know!?&quot; then I had to explain how the media has been pushing narratives to create upsets.  Its an obvious formula if you look for it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The problem is if you actually follow the money (advertising) then this was a terrible game.</p>

<p>It was just bad football for three quarters. We would have turned it off if we hadn&#39;t had a bracket going and we were definitely not paying much attention to ads or otherwise. </p>

<p>A big comeback win might be a good news story but that is hardly going to help ratings seven months from now. Also, why would the NFL reward a team and QB they were criticized for punishing at the beginning of th let season? Goddell was booed.</p>

<p>Simply there is nothing to gain from rigging this SB.  Now, any sports series can gain visibility and ad dollars when the series lasts longer. Forcing a tied game seven is great for revenue, but forcing a comeback in a single game is pointless.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Uh- betting generally closes before the game starts and a majority of bets are already placed so a huge lead by Atlanta won&#39;t change the books. The Patriots were only -3.</p>

<p>Also, people who actually gamble don&#39;t just bet on one team. They bet the line and the line was dropping before the game. Most the book was on the Patriots due to their perennial popularity. This combined with prop bets with big payouts for missed field goals, 2-point conversions, and overtime the books got trounced. It would be very strange for the game to be rigged towards giving a win to the heavy favorite, beating the line, and covering.</p>

<p>Finally, If you watched the game there were a bunch of clutch plays that were necessary for the comeback. Fabricating a historic comeback and overtime win is probably the less reliable then just betting on the game if you are putting money on the line.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>A couple things struck me during the game- and I was watching for it because I was sure going into it that the game was going to be fixed for the patriots.  </p>

<p>The number of holding and interference penalties against the falcons was ridiculous- with over 2x the number of penalties called against the falcons even when they were winning so significantly. There is almost always holding going on- the refs have a lot of sway with deciding when to throw a flag.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>An enormous holding penalty was called against the Atlanta Falcons on second down, pushing them out of field goal range on a crucial drive late in the fourth quarter. However, there was a clear face mask made on the same play as Mohamed Sanu was tackled out of bounds that wasn’t called. </p>

<p>The conversion that the patriots made on the td which tied it up, looked questionable- as did the final touchdown <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tXMPIbo54Mk">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tXMPIbo54Mk</a></p>

<p>Why wouldn&#39;t that final touchdown be reviewed? his knee was down before the ball crossed the plane.  They played 1 shot from the line, and quickly went to other views where it was less obvious.  The announcers were on board- they can&#39;t question the outcome at that point.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sanu was the dude who the facemask penalty would have been called on, he ripped the other guy&#39;s helmet off.  Since both penalties would have been on the offense, they wouldn&#39;t have cancelled out and the Pats would have had their pick of penalties to accept.</p>

<p>The touchdown and conversion were reviewed, all scoring plays are automatically reviewed.</p>

<p>James White&#39;s knee was not down before the ball broke the plane, only the tip of the ball has to cross the very front of the goal line for it to be a TD.</p>

<p>Mohommed Sanu had the ball and was getting facemasked when he ripped the other guy&#39;s helmet off.  You may be right, but either way there should have been a call there.</p>

<p>i didn&#39;t realize that.  still skeptical of those touchdowns. I suspect we will never see the endline videos on either of those, again.  If anyone DVRed it, I&#39;d suggest looking at it again.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>IMO if games are rigged its done by the referees. They can use their calls, or lack of, to sort of dictate the momentum of the game and try to control the outcome. Because the players would have no idea viewers wouldn&#39;t notice any lack of effort or bribed attempts to throw the game. Looks completely authentic yet the outcome is decided.</p>

<p>Having said this, I don&#39;t think football is really a sport where this sort of manipulation reaps much benefit. Reason being is each round is a single game where as in most other sports each round is a best of 5 or 7 series. This makes the attempt to rig a series a lot more worth it because you can get 3 more games worth of revenue. When you think of how much money is made off a single playoff game you realize its not that crazy to think they&#39;d try to manipulate series to go all 7 games.</p>

You cannot have players as actors because someone would snitch if they figured out the thing they have been working for turned out to be a lie the entire time.

    <div class="md"><p>I listen to a guy who was MK Ultra&#39;d and, several years after childhood, went on a quest to figure out wtf had happened to him. That led him to start meditating, etc. Eventually, his mind awakened and he remembered everything. He goes on to talk in great detail about everything that is really happening behind the scenes in the world -- i&#39;ll be honest, it gets a bit strange, he goes on and on about ETs controlling the paradigm and stuff but remains completely convincing and he was also recently and randomly assassinated -- and he admits that every major sports program we watch on TV is undoubtedly rigged by TPTB. </p>

<p>Shoot, who knows. They have the tech to create the internet and text messages. Doesn&#39;t blow my mind that they might have tech in space with the ability to mess with players&#39; physical functions at certain times. They might also cut players&#39; deals off the field and what not. Idk. I played college football and that game last night made me think Max Spiers, and you, are completely right. It just makes no sense.</p>
