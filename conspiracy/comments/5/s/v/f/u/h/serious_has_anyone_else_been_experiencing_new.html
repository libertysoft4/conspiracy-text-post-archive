        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Let me start by saying I have no mental illnesses, and I&#39;m a pretty intelligent person (by today&#39;s standards at least lol). I&#39;m a very logical, rational thinker and I know this concept is pretty esoteric but I think it&#39;s worth exploring with the rest of you skeptics... </p>

<p>I&#39;ve come to the conclusion that TPTB have conditioned the masses to reject any claims of psychic abilities and to associate them with mental illnesses to discredit those who may possess such powers. I also believe that everyone has these capabilities, but there are some who are born with a much more natural ability to access them. What is the purpose of having a brain that doesn&#39;t use 100% of it&#39;s capabilities, and only functions with about 10-50% of it&#39;s power? They&#39;ve kept us in such a sleepy state for so long that many people don&#39;t even question the possibility that these powers could be real... </p>

<p>Since I was a child, I&#39;ve noticed these tiny little orbs floating around and thought it was normal. Sometimes the orbs look like tiny little bubbles and other times they&#39;re dark and less defined. I remember a few years ago I looked into what they could be and I read somewhere that they were proteins. Fast forward to now, and my research has led me to the conclusion that these are in fact spiritual orbs. I&#39;ve also been hearing things that I can only explain as distant music, or conversation. I can&#39;t say specifically what it is that I&#39;m hearing, and it&#39;s not voices telling me to do things (for those of you who may think I&#39;m schizophrenic or deranged). I&#39;ve noticed this before but blocked it out of my mind because I felt like a lunatic, but after all of the reading I&#39;ve done, I now believe that I also possess some clairaudient and telepathic capabilities. I just don&#39;t know how to channel or use them properly yet. There are several other little instances that I could use as examples, but I won&#39;t bore you with those. </p>

<p>I only started doing my research into psychic abilities within the past few weeks, and I&#39;ve already run into several people who have said they&#39;ve experienced similar things. One of them said that his family had a history with these powers going back several generations and his family has taught him how to channel since a young age. The stories he shared about some of his experiences were incredible... He also told me that there are more of us than we realize, and that we tend to gravitate to each other. </p>

<p>My research started when I came across &#39;Indigo Children&#39;  &quot;Indigo children are those who are believed to represent a higher state of human evolution. .... <strong>The Indigo&#39;s life purpose is to bring awareness that the old systems no longer work and rally for change. They possess a low tolerance for people and systems that are not authentic and authority without a good cause or reason. They become very angry, frustrated and will act out if they sense injustice.</strong>  <a href="http://www.amagicalworld.com/index.php/indigo-crystal-children/what-is-the-indigo-child">http://www.amagicalworld.com/index.php/indigo-crystal-children/what-is-the-indigo-child</a> </p>

<p>I don&#39;t have the post saved, but recently, someone posted that the global energy frequency (not sure of the specific name for it) has gone up tremendously and is now at 36% after not breaking 8 or 9% for decades. Does this mean there&#39;s really a global awakening? Are any of you experiencing these things? </p>

<p>We are entering a time of enlightenment, and while the posts on here are often predicting the end times, I believe that we will experience the opposite and that good will ultimately prevail, although there will likely be a period of darkness before we reach that point. We can harness our energy and use it for good... people just have to be more open minded to these types of things and learn how to use their energy and vibrations properly. </p>

<p>I have to disagree, and before I argue my point; let me mention I see this all over the internet nowadays, and it is getting late, and pretty silly; Reality is already here, each one of us discover more of it as we go.</p>

<p>Reality works under Natural Law. Period. You may choose to create whatever &quot;reality tunnel&quot; you wish, but don&#39;t go into solipsism; then you will be trapped, and doom the rest of us in the process.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve actually had three moderately weird psychic type things happen to me in the past few days. Sunday I had rehearsal with this band I&#39;ve been with the past year, it&#39;s a ska band from the 90s and the bassist has kids and can&#39;t tour so I&#39;ve been filling in. I got the gig when I did the main guys solo album in 08. The album is great but totally shelved (old band reunited before he bothered pushing for publishing). My friend Jon did all the guitar tracks, and I havent seen or talked to him in about 4 years beyond the usual &quot;happy Thanksgiving &quot; text and whatnot. Dude pulls out these dusty demos during rehearsal and suggests throwing these songs in the set. Driving home from rehearsal Jon texted me and asked me what I&#39;ve been doing. Could have been a coincidence. Then the following day (Monday) I&#39;m listening to this album from 08 I did with said dude, and started just digging into old projects (I&#39;m a professional musician full time, there&#39;s a lot of old projects) and remembered this band I briefly had in 2010 that I loved but our lead singer fell off the face of the earth when he joined some rockabilly group and moved state lines. While watching a video with dude and I playing, he called me and told me he&#39;s moving back to NJ and wants to link up again. The following day (Tuesday), I&#39;m driving to same rehearsal as sunday, same spot, same band and I&#39;m about 5 minutes away (Brooklyn if your curious) and daydreaming in the car, and I had a vision that the rehearsal space was on fire and band practice was canceled. As I got closer I saw smoke and I thought no way. False alarm it was a fire the next block over (but same approximate location in the block). So I think weird but whatever, go into the studio and band leader is there saying I was about to call you, I forgot to book the room they&#39;re all booked up rehearsal is canceled </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I had a similar experience, but it was a few years ago. I took some LSD with my friend and went to a concert. Concerts done and it&#39;s time to go home. While driving, we enter this huge storm. We start talking about random shit, cause we&#39;re still tripping. I start telling a story about this kid I haven&#39;t seen or talked to in like 3 years. My friend asks, &quot;What ever happened to him?&quot; (Referencing friend that we hadn&#39;t seen in years). Right after he asks that question, my phone starts ringing. Guess who it was? I shit you not. It gets weirder. After we both freak out about the crazy coincidence, we calm down and start talking again. My friend&#39;s car was driving shitty in the heavy rain of the storm, and says, &quot;I fucking hate my car, I wish my mom would just total it or something, so I can get a new car.&quot; So I get home late and go to sleep, I wake up from a phone call from him the next day. So I answer, and the first thing he says is, &quot;Dude you&#39;re not going to believe what happened this morning! My Mom totaled my car this morning!&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Personally, I don&#39;t have the abilities you have, but I concider myself an &quot;Indigo&quot;. Much of the descriptions about them fit, but I am very careful about the New Age spin on Spirituality; I consider myself rational, perhaps too rational at times, to such a degree I can become rather &quot;unpopular&quot;.</p>

<p>But I do not exclude Spiritual Sight, as you seem to posess. I have relatives who operate in this realm, and have met many people who literally see and feel energies (auras, ghosts and things moving). </p>

<p>I can&#39;t, have not, but am open minded; I have delved to the deepest realms of existence philosophically, and can not exclude what you describe. At all.</p>

<p>The global energies you describe can also be attributed to the increase in EMF pollution on Planet Earth. I focus especially on technologies such as Atmospheric Heaters, as these spew out tremendous amounts of eleftromagnetic radiation into both the atmosphere and the Earth itself, to such a degree it affects the weather (clouds, mainly), biosphere (lack of bees for example), brainwaves and much much more.</p>

<hr/>

<p>As an overview to remember, we literally expell solar energy as life-force. Without the Sun, ee would not be.</p>

<p>All accumulation of life in the biosphere, combined with elements and chemical energy, operates in flux with solar energy present here.</p>

<p>One important aspect of what is happening, is that the natural biorythm, like Schumann-Resonance for example, has been ramped up in the last years.</p>

<p>This is one aspect of the &quot;awakening&quot; that is artificially induced with technology, which Tesla warned about, by the way.... That is why he split his papers of his invention into various pieces, and shipped them to various parts of the world. He knew that what he discovered had very dangerous potential.</p>

<p>Well, guess what; you are living it now.</p>

<hr/>

<p>Chemtrails; HAARP; Vaccines; DAB Radios, WiFi (operates at the exact frequency that disturbs water molecules. -How fucking convenient), Mobile Towers, Bluetooth headset on our heads and so on.</p>

<p>Every bit adds to the whole, and all this energy and all these frequencies are not meant to surround us. We run on Sunlight. But now these fields are more and more replaced with artificial energies, and frequencies that directly affect various systems within the body.</p>

<hr/>

<p>I know this might be hard to grasp, and I get that; It is hard to explain with &quot;old concepts and words&quot; to describe a new understanding.</p>

<p>But if you want to learn more, check out my little log on r/mEMRnorway to see what and how I have learned on the topic.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Forget about Indigo children. It&#39;s rubbish. Everyone has the potential to develop these abilities. I started noticing something like what you&#39;re describing – and I&#39;m now very familiar with the orbs you describe – since about early 2015. Since then, I have been working on sharpening these abilities.</p>

<p>I&#39;m now at a point where I can sit in a darkened room and, particularly with the help of cannabis, after not too long it will be filled with a cornucopia of little tykes and sprites.</p>

<p>Also, if I stare at a blank surface for a few minutes, it turns into a little movie screen upon which all this very strange stuff is to be seen. Mostly, it&#39;s a prehistoric earth with dinosaurs running around. Often it runs in time-lapse, and I see the waxing and waning of geologic features, or ancient cities springing up like Sim City on fast time mode.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve been sharpening these abilities simply by practicing. I discovered it one night at a party where I had taken a lot of LSD and MDMA and was laying on the grass looking at the featureless overcast sky at about 4am. For ages I thought that I needed those drugs to do it, but then one night just smoking some hash I noticed it, too. That was great because it meant I could practice it most nights.</p>

<p>I won&#39;t go into the drugs aspect here since there&#39;s plenty of information about that, but taking shrooms, DMT (smoked and as ayahuasca), LSD, 2C-B and MDMA and using those states to explore more fully has, over time, considerably improved my ability with it.</p>

<p>There&#39;s a post today about remote viewing on Mars, which leads me to consider that the movies of a prehistoric time that appear on my walls might be a remote viewing phenomenon.</p>

<p>In any case, I have a lot of information from personal experience about this and I&#39;m constantly doing my own experiments and research, so PM me if you&#39;d like to discuss it sometime! (my wife is pretty sick of hearing about the orbs haha).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s very interesting. Actually, on a few occasions what I&#39;ve seen looked very much like a collection of cells, and I could see platelet-looking streams of cells flowing around them.</p>

<p>At the time, it kind of bummed me out, because I started thinking that all this stuff I&#39;m seeing must just be seeing the cells of my retinas – i.e., not psychic. But, now that I think about it, how could that be? How would a tiny cellular-level portion of my retina show up in my vision like that, unless something is coming from the back of my retina, being magnified by the back-side of my cornea and projected back onto the retina for me to see... </p>

<p>This sounds more likely. Thanks for showing me – actually, I often see &#39;cells&#39;, but I had been dismissing it and waiting for more recognizable imagery to appear. I think I&#39;m going to try to set an intention to &#39;see&#39; something like this in particular. Usually, I just wait with no intention to see what pops up, usually the prehistoric movies.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This whole indigo thing is probably just to make weird people feel special. Being one of these weird people, I try to stay away from bullshit that manipulates the socially awkward. You might be being drawn into a cult so be careful. A common way people are drawn into cults is this idea of being special or human awakening. And we use pretty much 100% of our brain by the way the 10% thing&#39;s a myth. I haven&#39;t experienced any of these abilities, but you might be experiencing confirmation bias because you fit into the social aspect and want to fit into the superpower aspect. You say you&#39;re logical so try to consider the idea that you&#39;re being manipulated just to be safe I guess. I know this will piss people off, but I&#39;m trying to be the voice of logic and make sure people don&#39;t fall for bullshit or get taken advantage of</p>

    <div class="md"><p>holy fucking shit, fuck yes, been waiting for a thread like this to pop up</p>

<p>I&#39;m gonna start off by posting some of the weird pics I&#39;ve taken in the past few months </p>

<p><a href="http://imgur.com/Ixe8zPk">The Wisp</a></p>

<p><a href="http://imgur.com/TZ13b6k">Portal</a></p>

<p><a href="http://imgur.com/pI0NjOL">Portal Redux</a></p>

<p><a href="http://imgur.com/i8Pjo9h">Portal Redux 2</a></p>

<p>So they all seem to be made out of plasma, I&#39;ve got videos of them and you can see that the shape keeps changing or in the case of the portals, keeps turning around the central axis. As you can see also with the portal redux 2 pic, kinda fucks up the whole &quot;lens flare&quot; excuse because depending on alignment, the portal keeps the same shape but the &quot;emission&quot; changes</p>

<p>Also, before anyone says &quot;Lense flares&quot;, def not. </p>

<p>So, in my case, I have an effect on electronics. My laptop starts acting up whenever I have strong emotions or reactions. Synchronicity is way up, I always see repeating series of 3s and 4s and other meaningful series of numbers. My phone is unable to keep the time correctly whenever it&#39;s on me and the battery drains quickly, also depending on my mood.  My hair has started dreading naturally and I feel more in tune with the world and nature around me. People react to me differently. Whenever I bring up some of the more esoteric concepts, people just seem to believe me and start asking questions about it instead of assuming I&#39;m crazy. </p>

<p>I&#39;ve also started sun-gazing and the result of that is I can see these blue &quot;plasma&quot; beings on buildings and walls. They&#39;re snakelike in appearance, they have a blue aura and they move by extending and bunching up. I can&#39;t get these on camera. They&#39;re most visible whenever you have a &quot;retina burn&quot; from looking at the sun or at a bright light for 30-40 seconds. There are hundreds of them and they are everywhere. Also visual snow, which I&#39;ve always seen, has been getting easier to see. Other people see it when I point it out. </p>

<p>I&#39;ve also had a few experiences (when smoking devastating amounts of weed) to open my third eye and see sacred geometry in my vision overlapping &quot;real world&quot; things. Included is the &quot;pop&quot; noise in my head which I now assume is the sound of my third eye opening or whatever. </p>

<p>Amazing time to be alive ! Also, I didn&#39;t even in conspiracies until July 2016, so came a long way in a very short time. If anyone knows about the pics I posted, please share the info. Also, I&#39;ve seen shadow people and the guy with the hat, but I really don&#39;t like him</p>

I used to try to snap shots of spirits and things, but the best one can do is to go into a trance while looking at the picture you took in order to see the thing again.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>They&#39;re not lens flares I believe because the shapes change but are replicable. Also a lens flare doesn&#39;t have a shape or outline, it&#39;s just colour coming off the lens from a source of light. These things are self illuminated </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve experienced the shadow people and visual snow that you guys talk about. I also sometimes see something like a tiny portal into a world that has colour and light in the darkness before I sleep sometimes. This is only for a brief moment, and I have to keep it in my peripheral vision otherwise it goes away. </p>

<p>I&#39;ve also experienced unsettling encounters with people. </p>

<p>One lady recently discovered that she was part aboriginal after her grandmother died. A very interesting conversation ensued and I felt that she had &quot;awakened&quot;  to her true self and it had shifted her views quite dramatically. She then proceeded to talk about Vlad the Impaler lol. The topic change seemed to be outright bizarre at the time, but I went along with it because I did read up on him as a kid.  When I went home, I put on a podcast (JRE) that I was in the middle of, and then the topic shifted to Vlad the Impaler within 30s. The rationalist in me disregarded it as a mere coincidence, but it was still unsettling nonetheless. </p>

<p>The next encounter was a week later. </p>

<p>I went outside to smoke my ecig and a lady yelled out that the twilight period is when energy changes in people. Going from light to dark. I thought to myself, here we go - another drunk, and there&#39;s no one else around. She kept going and I asked her how she knew, she said she felt it. I became interested and asked her if she got the idea from some sort of spirituality. She dodged the question and said that I was smoking my ecig like an old man. This was funny to me, and I joked that old people wouldn&#39;t know how to use it. The literal meaning wasn&#39;t what she meant, she said that I had been around for ages and I knew what I was doing. A weird thing to say for sure, and I wasn&#39;t sure if she was trolling, so I asked her what she meant exactly by that. She said that I had a bad past but I&#39;m aiming to do good now. Still confusing in my head, but I&#39;m actually feeling something as she&#39;s saying this. She goes on to imply that we both have &quot;gifts&quot;, only that I hadn&#39;t figured it out yet. She also said it comes in threes in the family, and she mentioned something about my family and my circumstances that was very insightful. She lastly mentioned that a lot of pain will be required to get to the next stage. I of course asked her if she&#39;s joking, and if she could explain everything that she said specifically - to which: &quot;no&quot; and &quot;can&#39;t explain because you have to find out&quot;. The conversation got cut after this and I had to leave. </p>

<p>I still don&#39;t know if I got trolled or if it was actually something. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>In the last two weeks I have slowly unified an understanding of existence that puts together disparate pieces gleaned from previous realizations. </p>

<p>While before I merely thought there was &quot;something more&quot; in a vaguely spiritual sense, very recently it had come together for me in a much greater understanding. </p>

<p>Without going into too much detail while I type on mobile, what I have come to understand is that things which exist with certainty in relation to time actually project themselves forward into the &quot;future&quot; creating a timeline with relation to that certainty. This is true of material, thought, or action, and creates &quot;rivers&quot; of likely outcomes. </p>

<p>The perception of these timelines from an external view came to me almost crystal clear, and was somewhat relatable to the &quot;space warp&quot; portion of 2001: A space oddest, but they weren&#39;t colored any more than a vaguely sunlight yellow, and my perception of it was horizontal not vertical. I could see the paths of truth as they extended their certainty into the future, and the places where decisions caused a fork, or even a clouded area of possibility. </p>

<p>This exists on every scale, although planetary scale was actually almost entirely linear, and micro-scale was nebulously indeterminate. </p>

<p>My understanding is that communication is possible somehow between present existence and a timeline that is determined to exist. So far my belief is that this has to be achieved artificially  with electricity and some weird time issues with regard to Einsteinian relativity. There seems to be a massive focus on &quot;light&quot; as a nexus where energy is perceived (and therefore codified into a path of determination) while also being an indication of &quot;truth&quot; in a way that isn&#39;t really meant to along with the religious &quot;he is the truth and the light&quot; sense of those same terms. </p>

<p>There is a lot that has to do with perceptions of &quot;truth&quot; and the linking of the 5 senses to things like traditional &quot;shakras&quot; as being means to actively direct which timeline is followed. As truth comes into being, reality follows a path. </p>

<p>Strangest of all, everything has come through to me while entirely sober and of sound mind. Things previously experienced through high energy meditation enhanced by psychoactives now have a framework and context that they can be placed into as a unifying theory. </p>

<p>My current thinking is that we as a culture may be on the verge of a massive diversion between one of multiple major timelines, and this uncertainty is showing brief glimpses around the curtain. </p>

<p>The lasting image is of a film protection, where the light across the film represents &quot;now&quot; and the film extends infinitely outwards branching constantly... </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I had one weird experience so far. After a night rave where I took mdma, I just went by my business as normal day after without sleeping. It was real strong so I was still kinda feeling it</p>

<p>Well night after when I went to sleep I closed my eyes and I realized I could still fucking see. It was really weird. It was dark in my room, but I could see everything around me. Not very clearly, but it was weird as shit. I started flailing my arms around, turning around with my eyes closed and I could see all the movements. Just to try, I went to take a leak while keeping my eyes closed and I managed that without any isues. </p>

<p>Went back to bed and turned my phone flashlight on and put it onto my face. Instead of being blinded I just saw weird kaleidoscopic visions. Stayed up all night doing that shit, day after I was just exhausted after not sleeping for over two days.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve never tried hallucinogens but I&#39;m very tempted. Soon...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve had certain abilities since I was young but I would agree it is getting more intense. I scared the living shit out of my best friend yesterday because I had a quote from a movie pop into my head and felt the need to send it to her and she texted me back immediately saying her and her husband are watching that exact movie and as she read my text they said the exact line of the movie. Another example is I was about to leave my house yesterday and I had a really dark feeling so I waited until it disappeared, once it did I left and drove my route only to find a car accident had just occurred and a woman was in critical. Either it&#39;s weird timing or I knew it could&#39;ve been me. Typically for my entire life I would have little feelings here and there but it&#39;s getting stronger and almost daily at this point. I&#39;m really starting to freak myself out.</p>
