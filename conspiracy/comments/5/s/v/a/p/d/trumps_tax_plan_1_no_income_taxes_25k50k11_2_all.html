<h2><em>TAX REFORM THAT WILL MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN</em></h2>

<h3><em>The Goals Of Donald J. Trump’s Tax Plan</em></h3>

<p>Too few Americans are working, too many jobs have been shipped overseas, and too many
middle class families cannot make ends meet. This tax plan directly meets these challenges with
four simple goals:</p>

<ol>
<li>Tax relief for middle class Americans: In order to achieve the American dream, let people keep more money in their pockets and increase after-tax wages.</li>
<li>Simplify the tax code to reduce the headaches Americans face in preparing their taxes and let everyone keep more of their money.</li>
<li>Grow the American economy by discouraging corporate inversions, adding a huge number of new jobs, and making America globally competitive again.</li>
<li>Doesn’t add to our debt and deficit, which are already too large.</li>
</ol>

<h3><em>The Trump Tax Plan Achieves These Goals</em></h3>

<ol>
<li>If you are single and earn less than $25,000, or married and jointly earn less than $50,000, you will not owe any income tax. That removes nearly 75 million households – over 50% – from the income tax rolls. They get a new one page form to send the IRS saying, “I win,” those who would otherwise owe income taxes will save an average of nearly $1,000 each.</li>
<li>All other Americans will get a simpler tax code with four brackets – 0%, 10%, 20% and 25% – instead of the current seven. This new tax code eliminates the marriage penalty and the Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT) while providing the lowest tax rate since before World War II.</li>
<li>No business of any size, from a Fortune 500 to a mom and pop shop to a freelancer living job to job, will pay more than 15% of their business income in taxes. This lower rate makes corporate inversions unnecessary by making America’s tax rate one of the best in the world.</li>
<li>No family will have to pay the death tax. You earned and saved that money for your family, not the government. You paid taxes on it when you earned it.</li>
</ol>

<h3><em>The Trump Tax Plan Is Revenue Neutral</em></h3>

<p>The Trump tax cuts are fully paid for by:</p>

<p>1.Reducing or eliminating most deductions and loopholes available to the very rich.
2. A one-time deemed repatriation of corporate cash held overseas at a significantly discounted 10% tax rate, followed by an end to the deferral of taxes on corporate income earned abroad.
3. Reducing or eliminating corporate loopholes that cater to special interests, as well as deductions made unnecessary or redundant by the new lower tax rate on corporations and business income. We will also phase in a reasonable cap on the deductibility of business interest expenses.</p>

<h3><strong>DETAILS OF DONALD J. TRUMP’S TAX PLAN</strong></h3>

<p>America needs a bold, simple and achievable plan based on conservative economic principles. This plan does that with needed tax relief for all Americans, especially the working poor and middle class, pro-growth tax reform for all sizes of businesses, and fiscally responsible steps to ensure this plan does not add to our enormous debt and deficit.</p>

<p>This plan simplifies the tax code by taking nearly 50% of current filers off the income tax rolls entirely and reducing the number of tax brackets from seven to four for everyone else. This plan also reduces or eliminates loopholes used by the very rich and special interests made unnecessary or redundant by the new lower tax rates on individuals and companies.</p>

<h3><em>The Trump Tax Plan: A Simpler Tax Code For All Americans</em></h3>

<p>When the income tax was first introduced, just one percent of Americans had to pay it. It was never intended as a tax most Americans would pay. The Trump plan eliminates the income tax for over 73 million households. 42 million households that currently file complex forms to determine they don’t owe any income taxes will now file a one page form saving them time, stress, uncertainty and an average of $110 in preparation costs. Over 31 million households get the same simplification and keep on average nearly $1,000 of their hard-earned money.</p>

<p>For those Americans who will still pay the income tax, the tax rates will go from the current seven brackets to four simpler, fairer brackets that eliminate the marriage penalty and the AMT while providing the lowest tax rate since before World War II:</p>

<p>[Table]</p>

<p>With this huge reduction in rates, many of the current exemptions and deductions will become unnecessary or redundant. Those within the 10% bracket will keep all or most of their current deductions. Those within the 20% bracket will keep more than half of their current deductions.Those within the 25% bracket will keep fewer deductions. Charitable giving and mortgage interest deductions will remain unchanged for all taxpayers.</p>

<p>Simplifying the tax code and cutting every American’s taxes will boost consumer spending, encourage savings and investment, and maximize economic growth.</p>

<h3><em>Business Tax Reform To Encourage Jobs And Spur Economic Growth</em></h3>

<p>Too many companies – from great American brands to innovative startups – are leaving America, either directly or through corporate inversions. The Democrats want to outlaw inversions, but that will never work. Companies leaving is not the disease, it is the symptom.</p>

<p>Politicians in Washington have let America fall from the best corporate tax rate in the industrialized world in the 1980’s (thanks to Ronald Reagan) to the worst rate in the industrialized world. That is unacceptable. Under the Trump plan, America will compete with the world and win by cutting the corporate tax rate to 15%, taking our rate from one of the worst
to one of the best.</p>

<p>This lower tax rate cannot be for big business alone; it needs to help the small businesses that are the true engine of our economy. Right now, freelancers, sole proprietors, unincorporated small businesses and pass-through entities are taxed at the high personal income tax rates. This treatment stifles small businesses. It also stifles tax reform because efforts to reduce loopholes and deductions available to the very rich and special interests end up hitting small businesses and
job creators as well. The Trump plan addresses this challenge head on with a new business income tax rate within the personal income tax code that matches the 15% corporate tax rate to help these businesses, entrepreneurs and freelancers grow and prosper.</p>

<p>These lower rates will provide a tremendous stimulus for the economy – significant GDP growth, a huge number of new jobs and an increase in after-tax wages for workers.</p>

<h3><em>The Trump Tax Plan Ends The Unfair Death Tax</em></h3>

<p>The death tax punishes families for achieving the American dream. Therefore, the Trump plan eliminates the death tax.</p>

<h3><em>The Trump Tax Plan Is Fiscally Responsible</em></h3>

<p>The Trump tax cuts are fully paid for by:</p>

<ol>
<li>Reducing or eliminating deductions and loopholes available to the very rich, starting by steepening the curve of the Personal Exemption Phaseout and the Pease Limitation on itemized deductions. The Trump plan also phases out the tax exemption on life insurance interest for high-income earners, ends the current tax treatment of carried interest for
speculative partnerships that do not grow businesses or create jobs and are not risking their own capital, and reduces or eliminates other loopholes for the very rich and special interests. These reductions and eliminations will not harm the economy or hurt the middle class.Because the Trump plan introduces a new business income rate within the personal income tax code, they will not harm small businesses either.</li>
<li>A one-time deemed repatriation of corporate cash held overseas at a significantly discounted 10% tax rate. Since we are making America’s corporate tax rate globally competitive, it is only fair that corporations help make that move fiscally responsible. U.S.-owned corporations have as much as $2.5 trillion in cash sitting overseas. Some companies have been leaving cash overseas as a tax maneuver. Under this plan, they can bring their cash home and put it to work in America while benefitting from the newly-lowered corporate tax rate that is globally competitive and no longer requires parking cash overseas. Other companies have cash overseas for specific business units or activities. They can leave that cash overseas, but they will still have to pay the one-time repatriation fee.</li>
<li>An end to the deferral of taxes on corporate income earned abroad. Corporations will no longer be allowed to defer taxes on income earned abroad, but the foreign tax credit will remain in place because no company should face double taxation.</li>
<li>Reducing or eliminating some corporate loopholes that cater to special interests, as well as deductions made unnecessary or redundant by the new lower tax rate on corporations and business income. We will also phase in a reasonable cap on the deductibility of business interest expenses.</li>
</ol>

    <div class="md"><p>Well that&#39;s good to know that he did that.  Thanks for letting me know.  I saw a clip of him bad mouthing Trump&#39;s picks and some speculations Sanders made and it made me unhappy.  Was hoping he&#39;d see what Trump is doing and instead of battling him to make some money on cnn he&#39;d turn his back finally and offer his services to Trump.  Who might want to say &#39;nah&#39; out of ego but his people would tell him to use Sander&#39;s support for marketing.  This of course hasnt&#39; happened.  I wonder if Sanders has ties to this pizza gate stuff.  Lots of crap going down this week, as we speak.  Waiting for the other shoe to drop by hopefully end of this weekend.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>One thing that&#39;s disappointing is the co-opting of actual progressive and grassroots groups that supported him by the Democrats since the convention. On the Sanders side there was a lot of &quot;let&#39;s bridge the gap between Democrats and Republicans with things that strengthen the middle class we can all get behind&quot; and there wasn&#39;t this ridiculous oppose all Republican no matter what attitude. Now that the establishment Democrats lost they&#39;re trying to be like &quot;see guys, we&#39;re all on the same side- we don&#39;t like Trump, we&#39;re friends now!&quot; when in reality they spent millions trying to make Bernie and his supporters go away when it was more convenient for them. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thank you.  When someone says &quot;that should be in T_D&quot; I&#39;m taking this to be a type of CTR, simply because they feel that anything related to supporting trump should be in it&#39;s own nerfed, controlled echo chamber and shouldn&#39;t be &#39;let out&#39; into the larger public.  In this way, they are trying to suppress the speech and control the &#39;spectrum of discourse&#39;</p>

<p>So <a href="/u/Laragon">/u/Laragon</a> basically has acted in an oblique way, and probably unwittingly as a type of ad populist controlled opposition, by hinting at the fact that I&#39;m not allowed to say anything in support of Trump--even factual support--which I strongly disagree is not appropriate for this forum, for exactly this reason, which to me is self-evident</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No you didn&#39;t.  It&#39;s obvious now that you are some kind of forum spy</p>

<p>I did NOT vote for Trump, and you said I should post this in T_D</p>

<p>I was for bernie but I&#39;m actually seeing what Trump is trying to do, and instead of combatting him and telling him / others that what he&#39;s trying to do isn&#39;t going to work, I actually like what he&#39;s trying to do and support what he&#39;s trying to do</p>

<p>I&#39;ve never in my life been more behind a president than this one, simply because the rest of the establishment hates him so I KNOW he&#39;s doing the right things.</p>

<p>Because our governmnet has gotten to be such a joke that if they oppose him then it&#39;s because he threatens all their con games</p>

<p>I&#39;m hoping that by the end of this weekend, he will have so many of these politicos in jail for being involved in Hillary&#39;s cadre and their crimes (search this sub for george webb cliff notes, I&#39;m not going to debate you on  this one)...if he does that.  If he and Sessions take back control of DOJ and the FBI, then when he goes to pass this tax reform bill, they will all let him do it because they will be terrified</p>

<p>Now you might say, &#39;oh he&#39;s politically blackmailing or threatening congress&#39;.  Not exacltly.  Trump didn&#39;t make them put their dicks in children ten years ago, nor did he make them eat a spirit cooking cake fashioned into a human person so they could jump the line on an organ donor list to get a new kidney that they took from a war orphan they created by breaking geneva convention and using ill-gotten libyan sarin gas on their families in syra, for example</p>

<p>but you know, the neolibs know nothing about these things</p>

<p>I&#39;ts not their fault</p>

<p>Seymour Hersh&#39;s artilce the &#39;redline and the ratline&#39; was suppressed in the US </p>

<p>This is the crux of the issue, and this is why I posted this post originally and THAT is the conspiracy</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My main worry is tax cuts are great but if our countrys debt keeps going up there will come a time that our taxes will have to go up to cover all our debts and interest payments. A tax cut is like having 3 mortgages and you decide to get a part time job because it&#39;s easier and you think the mortgages will just cover themselves. As a country we have a deficit every year which means we cant even cover our current budgets and the plan looks like the yearly budget deficits will increase. Now if trump does put I  a tax cut and manages to not have a deficit then i will  vote for. him in 2020. I rather  have the same taxes or even a slight increase as long as i know there is no deficit for 2018 2019 and 2020. We have to be responsible and not just Instant gratification whores that want tax cuts without any thought of the negatives. Personally i think i pay too much taxes I&#39;m married and we both.paid 18k total  this year for federal and state including self employment taxes etc. I dont want my 2 yr old to inherit a 40trillion debt when she&#39;s 18 at the rate we are going......</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No it&#39;s not.. the rich don&#39;t actually pay the massive taxes. If you think a Rothschild is dumb enough to allow 30% of their estate gobbled up by the state then idk what to tell you. Paying double taxes on something that you earned is absolute theft and the death tax is a complete scam. This will help a lot of middle class families secure whatever nest egg they created for the next generations.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I thought that was kinda lame before I realized that honestly it doesn&#39;t matter because <em>if enforced</em> the 15% corporate rate and the 25% top bracket would bring in far far more than a capped estate tax.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;d rather have a rich family retain their money than give it to a state.  Because rich famlies don&#39;t have sovereign immunity, but the state does.</p>

<p>So if you had a rich familiy that created a militia, you could just blow them up and/or sue them later for damages and/or put the heads of their army in jail or execute them</p>

<p>But you can&#39;t do that with the Government.  They get away with everything</p>

<p>So the idea of preventing an oligarchy by keeping a death tax doesn&#39;t really understand how things fundamentally work.  </p>

<p>Oligarchy is not what you think it is. It&#39;s a public-private-partnership.  By removing the death tax you are defunding the immutable &quot;public&quot; part, thus eliminating the oligarchy</p>
