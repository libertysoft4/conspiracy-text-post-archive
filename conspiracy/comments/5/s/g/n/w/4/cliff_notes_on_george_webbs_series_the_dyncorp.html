        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p><strong>DynCorp Harvest</strong></p>

<p><strong>This series is rated R for Mature Adults.</strong></p>

<p>In the DynCorp Harvest series, George incrementally describes a luxury medical tourism resort in Northern Haiti, funded by USAID and built by the Clinton Foundation, whose revenue-earning underpinnings are purported to be a) an illegal organ harvesting market, b) human sex trafficking Dyncorp-Slim ratline and c) microlending loansharking debt slavery by DynCorp--the CIA&#39;s privatized, covert-services contractor.</p>

<p>The organs are proposed to be either transplanted in Haiti into rich elites skipping the lines with help from organ brokers he believes the Podestas and Braverman-the-doctor to be, or shipped to locations throughout the US to various aristocratic outlets; while women are forced into cellphone-based debt slavery and prostitution; and children are sex-trafficked to Colombia or stowed aboard a medical ship bound for a port in Norfolk Va to be (mkultra-best-use/sex/assassin/politician) trafficked in DC (and abroad).  Furthermore, and much like they were in Vietnam, the bodies would then be zipped in DynCorp bodybags, shipped abroad with organs removed and replaced with illegal drugs.</p>

<p>These activities, in addition to blackmailing police forces, politicians, and industry influencers into compliance and loyal servitude--the so-called <em>Brownstone Operations</em>--are the &quot;natural and necessary&quot; functions of the CIA, because--<em>the company</em> erroneously believes--these activities are needed to fund these selfsame covert operations!  Putting it more simply, <em>&quot;We need to commit crimes so we can continue to commit crimes.&quot;</em></p>

<p>There.  Now you understand the CIA.</p>

<ul>
<li>David Petraeus DOD plan -- the spoils of war include harvest of everything</li>
<li>&quot;Downstream Derivative&quot;--the bonus--is they get to test vaccines by first creating the problem</li>
<li>&quot;I know CNN wants you to think about other things&quot;</li>
<li>We started with Clinton Foundation and we ended up with Dr. Paul Farmer</li>
<li>We started looking at who he is teaching and what is coming out it.  It&#39;s a transplant specialty is what is taught</li>
<li>The Transplant doctors are going back and forth between the Cleveland Clinic and war-torn areas</li>
<li>The question I posed is: Are they doing this within the US?  Is the CIA/Dyncorp doing this to their political opponents?</li>
<li>Trump hosts their annual convention in Florida for the last seven years.  So is HE a customer?  I dunno!</li>
<li>Film, <em>21 Grams</em>, same 2 actors Sean Penn and Naomi Watts as in other Lionsgate film, <em>Fair Game</em>, about a drug dealer who sells Sean Penn a heart.</li>
<li>It&#39;s kind of a &#39;hidden in plain sight&#39; with the Clintons and Dyncorp.  Maybe Bush did it too.</li>
<li>It seems to be Hillary&#39;s touch to add the film about it, just to show that, &quot;nobody&#39;s ever going to figure it out&quot;</li>
<li>Dr. Eric Braverman organ salespitch redux, long relationship with Petraeus and Clinton</li>
<li>George discusses the shift of clientele from soldiers to the senescence market of the aging elite</li>
<li>Fergie was in on a charity called the Path with Braverman</li>
<li>You have a bank of hearts in one country but you only have an hour or so to get it to the US, so you need to create more &quot;targets&quot; in the US</li>
<li>If you want to challenge the facts on this I have [evidence for] Bosnia, Kosovo, Afganistan</li>
<li>JTTF in US: CIA has inserted itself into FBI via brownstown ops by planting a revenge motive to do something illegal and terrible like gangraping Jessa Dillow-Crisp.</li>
<li>[Christopher Reeve] -- lets say he did a protest movie about war, and the pentagon didn&#39;t like it.  They could shoot your horse with a pellet gun as you&#39;re going over a jump--to give you a warning.  I don&#39;t think they thought it would turn out the way it did.  If you keep on speaking out against war, all of a sudden your wife [Dana Reeve] does young.  I don&#39;t think she had &quot;old heart&quot;</li>
<li><em>James Elephantitis</em> -- has a pig farm.  Which I thought was interesting for one of the most powerful men in washington.    {{&quot;le chomp&quot; <del>body disposal</del> restaurant leftovers disposal pig farm}}</li>
<li>Doug Coe: It&#39;s all intimidation along the way.</li>
<li>O.U.R. Operation uUnderground Railroad.  Using the revenge motive to get christian groups to attack guys like us.</li>
<li>OUR, everyone is saying it&#39;s a sham charity, a front organization for navy seal team that has no rules...to operate with impunity around the world.  No oversight, no paperwork, no followup.</li>
<li>Caracol park, I said this industrial park was going to get like a 1000 businesses, and they were all going to get loans from the World Bank and then they were going to fold over time after all the money was loaned out.  This is like the <em>Arkansas Development Fund</em>  I think this is done through the export/import bank run through the World Bank that has Congress oversight.  EXIM Bank.  They collapsed it last year in 2015.  They collapsed 10 yr insured loans, which Congress co-signed...Congress had to pay that out.  I think that&#39;s where Hillary got the extra 5B dollars.</li>
<li>George shows a spending ledger of USAID assistance money.  He points to Petits Freres et Soeurs, and says this was for moving kids around.  They all had different illnesses.  That&#39;s because--he believes--dyncorp was spraying the area with different things.</li>
<li>Cellphones help you track migration versus vectors and who died; micro versus macro longitudinal studies</li>
<li>Hospital ship comfort goes ashore in tents to do statistical studies and then do followup operations and biopsies on the ship.</li>
<li>You create traffic back and forth from shore to ship and then move in the bodies at night into the ship to do the organ extractions</li>
<li>People in the health field are going to start remembering interactions with the CIA and these details, now that the &#39;working theory&#39; is out there.</li>
<li>If I&#39;m CIA and I want to do a study, I put it through Dyncorp or through a foundation</li>
<li>CGI [Clinton Global Initiative] hasn&#39;t gone anywhere, they say it&#39;s shut down.  It&#39;s going to be funded by Rockefeller on the other coast through the Google Foundation</li>
<li>Bill Swing is Mr. Virus and Fred Eshelman is Mr. Vaccine.  And there&#39;s the body bags.  I believe they are going to atlanta to the CDC.</li>
<li>All these US foreign service officers, they&#39;re all from Johns Hopkins.  Is it like Cleveland Clinic...a big organ transplant center?  Yes it is! For overseas people?  Yes it is.  Who else graduated from there? Andrew Young.  Where else was he the mayor of? Atlanta: The Center for Disease Control.  I just connect the dots I&#39;m not making any accusations.</li>
<li>I remember Wayne Williams [Atlanta Murders of 1979-81]<sup><sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta_murders_of_1979%E2%80%9381">[1]</a><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wayne_Williams">[]</a></sup></sup> and these <strong><em>33</em></strong> kids dying [23 actually, according to wikipedia], and this guy had this Dr. Spock grip.  He didn&#39;t kill the kids initially, he just seemed to incapacitate them.</li>

<li>CIA is like the fourth branch of government.</li>
<li>If the 3 branches are kids playing in the sandbox, CIA is kind like inviting Harambe [gorilla] into the sandbox.  You hope it will be nice but you start seeing Harambe dragging kids in circles. You wonder if it&#39;s safe</li>
<li>That&#39;s where we are at with Dyncorp in the United States.  It&#39;s been that way since 9/11. But it&#39;s getting worse and I&#39;ll show that.</li>
<li>There is nothing to say they can&#39;t do the same things they did the Libya, Syria topples in any country around the world {{ including the US }}</li>
<li>In order to combat this clandestine period since 1974 is an open operation, an open media research investigation.</li>
<li>I take in news stories, connect things and summarize it.</li>
<li>George calls himself a glorified stenographer in an open media investigation.  {{ Nope, that&#39;s me.  You&#39;re the Captain of video, steering this thing }}</li>
<li>Pfullendorf Germany &quot;Vile Revelations of &#39;Sadistic Naked Sex Rituals&#39; at Elite German Military Base&quot; -- in a bigger picture view, it&#39;s part of a larger brownstone operation in the organ harvest chain -- compartmentalize and then compromise</li>
<li>Team Rubicon recap</li>
<li>Dana Braverman: It&#39;s almost like they took NY Jewish kids to Israel, retrained them and named the &#39;bravermans&#39;</li>
<li>Update to Cleveland Clinic.  The gal who got sent home to Saudi is going to sue.  They are trying to make a big deal of this extreme vetting thing.  It&#39;s actually a cover.  The CLeveland Clinic has been hammered a couple of times.  They are called an &#39;organ-friendly hospital&#39;.  I think I&#39;ve figured out the link here:</li>
<li>Paul Farmer is teaching in Rwanda, in Haiti and these genocide countries.  He&#39;s teaching these interns--the same ones being turned away up here--to do organ extractions, and now then they are coming back to the US to do organ transplants.  You need semi-skilled people doing extractions, and then they go to Cleveland clinic to learn under an expert to do the transplants.  When you look at the money [behind organ / blood harvesting] it&#39;s just too [compelling of a profit motive drive] to ignore</li>
<li>Cord blood can be substituted for bone marrow, used to treat leukemia, and it&#39;s a lot easier to match -- university of denver and UCD medical is going to be a big cord blood bank.</li>
<li>Secret film by Project Veritas and Planned Parenthood and the cord blood.  Nucatola -- Senior Diretor of Clinical Services, aborted fetus heart harvesting/transplants</li>
<li>Emergent Biosciences Zsolt playing both sides viruses + vaccines</li>
<li>Hospital ship in Honduras right now called the Spearhead; I&#39;m convinced it&#39;s a teaching hospital for doing transplants</li>
<li>There are 9 more ships being commissioned.  They are trying to speed up the ships / get faster ships to transport organs quicker.</li>
<li>Drug money is being laundered through Lionsgate films to create films of every operation they do {{&quot;confessing&quot;}} -- you find this in high tech also</li>
<li>There&#39;s also a film called <em>The Island</em> about CIA agents impregnating women so they&#39;ll have organs as they get older</li>
<li>Dr. Braverman&#39;s patient list is going to be the buyers. Sold by Podesta, by Paul Farmer, by office art, and by ritualistic practice with cake; Fleischaker email is the evidence and testimonial of an elite organ market.</li>
<li>New citation about a Turkish doctor that has done 23,000 kidney transplants in Bosnia, Kosovo and now doing transplants in Aleppo.</li>
<li>Glen Beck travels to Haiti with Operation Underground Railroad--his role is to add legitimacy</li>
<li>Tim Ballard, ex-DHS Ceo -- Operation Underground Railroad</li>
<li>Public-Private-Partnership?  No it&#39;s vigilante kidnap and extorting unit created for asset seizure; it&#39;s the farthest extention of a public-private-partnership you can get. In fact, there&#39;s no public piece to this.  They do stings with DHS.  They are extorting money.</li>
<li>Kids are being used, being kidnapped, and at least being bloodfarmed for cryogenics and for cord blood.</li>
<li>And their wives don&#39;t even know it, that&#39;s the sad part: they are all ex-special forces--guys trained to go in and kill everybody.</li>
<li>University of Denver will be a big transplanation center and blood banks</li>
<li>North of Boulder near RMNP, you&#39;re going to have your big underground complex.  With their current disposition matrix, they are deciding who is going to get to go into the tunnel into the complex if nuclear war happens.  Just like Kissinger&#39;s paper at Harvard.  And the movie &quot;Dr Strangelove&quot;</li>
<li>With Palantir I can follow all my assets with the cellphones</li>
<li>Lots of recaps</li>
<li>Dick Gregory (activist) agrees with George about Wayne Williams Atlanta killings theory mentioned previously</li>
<li><strong><em>The only way the open operations have a chance about the covert operations is by putting out the 650k emails, at least the metadata.  The public has no chance, there&#39;s no other way.  People say, &quot;oh Pompeo is coming in&quot;.  No Intelligence directorate which intercepts everything going to the director and redirects it.  So that&#39;s not a solution. The only solution is sunshine.</em></strong></li>

<li>The difference between Vietnam&#39;s Phoenix operation and this operation is organ harvesting</li>
<li>Petraeus added more use of gassing and psychological operations -- turning villages against each other. &quot;gang-countergang&quot; {{Jesuit trick}}</li>
<li>Bone marrow cells can stay alive 17 days after death, so that kind of negates all the other stuff [given the price per gram], don&#39;t know if that many people have leukemia</li>
<li>Somebody mentioned that Cleveland Clinic and Johns Hopkins both have hospitals in Dubai, UAE</li>
<li>Repo Men, Daybreakers, Matrix and the Island -- organ harvesting films; trying to normalize organ harvesting</li>
<li>Trying to find if Dan Braverman from Team Rubicon is related to Dr. Eric Braverman.  It could just be Mossad, kids go back [Israel] and come back as a &quot;braverman&quot;</li>
<li>George wonders if Fleishaker&#39;s PAM email list is a &quot;social justice&quot; list, like oh we got a new heart for this person and it came from this bad guy over here; and [for example] Peter Kadzik made it happen through the DOJ through a domestic harassment campaign [targetted individuals of government gangstalking]  DHS has this terrorist watchlist that--like the Phoenix program--targetted [baddies] originally terrorists but then ultimately ends up targetting completely innocent people [political adversaries doing nothing more than exercising constitutionally-guaranteed right to free speech, expression and collaboration]</li>
<li>Prayer breakfast tomorrow</li>
<li>I saw a guy named Doug Valentine who wrote a thick book about the Phoenix program, and he talked about the white helmets being a fake organization</li>
<li>What he said about the Phoenix program was interesting--south Vietnam had 44 provinces and they put a terror-torture center in each province.  Then in the districts (counties) they put a JTTF type officer in each district.  Exactly like our fusion centers.  One in each state and then expand out to each police force you put a JTTF officer.</li>
<li>Exactly what I was saying: 10,000 dollars and you take over a whole country [by taking over the police force]</li>
<li>Regarding Glenn Beck.  I didn&#39;t mean to say all Mormons were are behind all this.  <em>There&#39;s a group of Mormons called</em> <strong><em>FLBS</em></strong> <em>that believe in the bigamy, and they also believe in these tunnels because the feds were always after them</em>.  What I&#39;m saying is that the CIA, when they go to a group like this--they are anthropologists almost--they look and see to the habits and patterns that they will respond positively to, and they [steer the cults using their own culture--&quot;it&#39;s your culture&quot;--alephantis]</li>
<li>CIA is going to have a hand in every type of religion and cult and steer it</li>
<li>Vietnamese were afraid they wouldn&#39;t go to heaven if their liver was eaten, so [the CIA] would cut out the liver and make sure villagers see it.</li>
<li>The same reason Israelis have women soldiers, because Muslims believe they won&#39;t go to heaven if they are killed by a woman.  Automatic machine guns in the Paletinian areas, they&#39;ll make sure they are manned by women crews</li>
<li>Mormon cutouts, and exploiting hierarchies</li>
<li>Operation Underground Railroad, Tim Ballard, and the Super Bowl.  Young women targetted.</li>
<li>They are not going to be prosecuted, they will be put into an asset forfeiture program; to put a revenge motive in a group and take the whole family&#39;s assets</li>
<li>World Vision Vaccine &quot;Cothy O&#39;Brien&quot;  Cathy O&#39;Brien talked about the world vision vaccine used [in Haiti], she said she trafficked drugs and was used as a sex slave in Haiti</li>
<li>Anyone who has information about the foreign officers around the hospital ships.  Those are the people going ashore and making deals about who is going to get transplants, they will be the salesman for hospital ship transplants.</li>
<li>You&#39;re not forgotten Monica Petersen.</li>

<li>News update: going to meet with an Oliver Stone person to make this into a motion picture</li>
<li>Jorge Puello from Haiti is trying to contact George</li>
<li>When the CIA/Dyncorp were created they had a kind of GOD complex  [Guns/Gold Oil/Opium/Orgies/Organs Drugs]</li>
<li>Dyncorp is the cutting up of the kill and using all the parts</li>
<li>Wild Bill Donovan was the cowboy that gave that spirit to these &#39;happy crew of pirates&#39;</li>
<li>As you get closer to the reality, you see that it&#39;s ugly.  It gets into infecting populations with viruses and selling the vaccines, sex and drug trafficking ends up with a lot of ruined lives and prostitution killing themselves with drug overdoses &quot;that&#39;s just not a fun thing&quot; {Lol}</li>
<li>The profits are so big with organ biz that you end up throwing in guys-like-me in with the bad guys; we may as well throw in a few journalists in too.  They stand between us and overthowing the country.  So we got to get rid of them.  That&#39;s a very orwellian view of the world; but that&#39;s why Dyncorp was created.</li>
<li>George describes the slippery slope of using JTTF fixers to go after political enemies turning into going after business enemies</li>
<li>CIA and State Dept are kind of the same thing; it&#39;s just the State Dept is the political side of the Dept of Defense {{versus the Pentagon which is the military side of DoD}}</li>
<li>Is Monica Petersen alive and part of the witness protection?   I don&#39;t think so.  Too many upset family and friends</li>
<li>&quot;Political Military Officers Set Up Underground Railroads&quot; -- text</li>
<li>A lot of these kids are survivors of wars [wards of the cia] and become foreign officers, groomed, and selected by the Madam Allbrights of the world.  They are selected and groomed.  George mentions they could have been sired by the people in the CIA, again for potential organ harvesting; [and that would explain why Obama is related to George Bush and Dick Cheney within an otherwise statistically unlikely number of generations]</li>
<li>&quot;The CIA does not care about the people of Haiti&quot; They want to control 3 things: the military, the checkbook/budget and the President</li>
<li>&quot;I want to create a political bond with the elite in a country.  In order to keep a country you need the leaders and you need the elite--you don&#39;t need to worry about the people.  The elite need health services, so they are going to want to buy organs--hearts.  You are going in there [with the military] and farm it that way. The reason why this hospital ship is going all around to these 11 different places isn&#39;t to provide healthcare to the poor: it&#39;s to provide healthcare to the elite.&quot;</li>
<li>CNN will have a cover story--always--about some poor person getting it so that the impression is given in your mind, but the healthcare is for the elites.</li>

<li>Rice study for Bill Clinton, probably several different viruses in it</li>
<li>USAID and UNICEF running that program and MercyCorp and World Vision will be the information collectors to see how the studies are going.</li>
<li>I&#39;m not going to call Puello because I know it&#39;s a diversion, I know it&#39;s __<strong><em>(unintelligble--sounds like saudis)</em></strong></li>
<li>If you don&#39;t publish the 650k emails, then you lose all credibility and you are fake news</li>
<li>Israel, China and Russia have this information!</li>
<li>Somebody said it&#39;s another 1M that the McCabes got. So that&#39;s 1.6M now (quid pro quo) for Mccabe&#39;s wifes run</li>

<li>UAE Dr Israel just had his practice shut down for selling bone marrow has moved to Germany</li>
<li>Cleveland Clinic is one of the greatest medicial institutions of all time, and they&#39;ve moved to UAE</li>
<li>We split off UAE from Saudi to militarily control the Strait of Hormuz to retain access to the Persian Gulf, like the Suez canal</li>
<li>UAE has changed their organ transplant laws so you can call someone dead before they are dead, which enables live transfer</li>
<li>All those missing 15,000 organs are within short flight to UAE</li>
<li>The CIA likes to do things by running around the Congress.  [They avoid all the laws of the US and get away with everything we don&#39;t want them doing around the world.]</li>
<li>&quot;Doc to Dock No inspection for Organs Leaving Flex Jets&quot; -- it smacks of this cover.  Passenger, executive jet that seats 20, not a cargo jet, 20 prisoners going back, boxes coming out.  What you don&#39;t see in the social justice films.  Homen square is then the holding pen for the 20</li>
<li>&quot;La Difference School&quot; -- George Washington Barbados kid, Alexander Hamilton was the son.  If you want to have genetic matches in you later years, you have organ kids stowed away [maybe they suceed you or maybe they&#39;re your liver donor]</li>
<li>Dyncorp is spraying El Salvador and Columbia.  George believes they are spraying viruses</li>
<li>Meeting with Oliver Stone folks in a few minutes.</li>
<li>Jorge Puello is the fixer, sets up the translater, etc.  He sets up ratlines; and all the criminality is all-one-thing</li>
<li>You&#39;re going to find the same thing in India.  It started in India in 1974 (Yunus)</li>
<li>Before Watergate, it was the biggest brownstone ever.  The DC madam case with Barney Frank</li>
<li>Same with Syga Thomas---he bought his brownstone from James Alefantis</li>
<li>Max McCoby DC Metro &quot;James Alefantis Silby Connection&quot; Nous Petit Frere et Souer CIA Lawyer &quot;Set Up Man&quot; -- hes a cia guy.</li>
<li>Alefantis is a CIA guy, his dad is a CIA guy.  McCoby didn&#39;t study, wanted to be a Yale guy (&quot;a yaley&quot;), couldn&#39;t cut it</li>
<li>Carl Shoffler was the first Tim Ballard-- Watergate Arresting Police Officer.  He had all the informants and all the setups for the brownstones.  This brownstone stuff goes back 40 yrs.  It&#39;s been privatized with Booze Allen Hamilton</li>
<li>Wikipedia rumor of more forthcoming releases</li>
<li>The future of journalism is data analysis -- doing what George is doing</li>
<li>People are saying Trump gave Chaffetz the go-ahead -- I don&#39;t think so. I think they are going to try to impeach him or militarily overthrow him.</li>
<li>Netinyahu is saying &#39;enough is enough&#39;, you&#39;ve surrounded my country with muslim brotherhood terrorist topple activities.  I&#39;m not going to let it go on.  I have these 650,000 emails. Even if I have to hang my foreign minister out to dry for your brownstones, I&#39;ll do, because I don&#39;t want loose stingers surrounding my country.</li>

<li>Met with the Hollywood couple.  They seem to know everyone in Hollywood to pitch this to them.  Let&#39;s call them Valerie and Joe.</li>
<li>I told them about the responses I&#39;ve gotten from the community, using their unique skillsets.  Talks about a researcher in Korea.</li>
<li>Everytime I do an episode, it launches a thousand &#39;fruitful searches&#39;.</li>
<li>Sibel Edmonds is closer to this with Newsbud.</li>
<li>There&#39;s no script just incredible researchers that give him the data</li>
<li>Haiti turned out to be the key to the whole thing.  Haiti is a victim of the vaccine, organ harvesting, sex/drug/gun trafficking everything, organ/bloodmining thing.</li>
<li>Haiti is the model organism for understanding the whole microcosm of criminality</li>
<li>I watched this Russian documentary they did after Kosovo &quot;Zene CRNOM&quot;-- french named &#39;doctors without borders&#39; is a Soros company directly in the middle of the whole thing.</li>
<li>&quot;Prisoners are being blood mined in secret prisons&quot; {{google: &quot;arkansas prison blood scandal factor 8 suppressed documentary&quot;}}</li>
<li>&quot;Hillary is the &quot;Shadow Secretary of State&quot;&quot;</li>
<li>There were 21 emails that came out today due to Judicial Watch.  It was a nothingburger.  They are slowfooting the investigation</li>
<li>Jorge Puello is no longer wanted--he served his time so George apologizes for saying that.  He wants to expose the downstream.   But we want to go upstream.  You aren&#39;t going to drain the swamp by going downstream.</li>
<li>Jorge tell us who the operatives are.  Just publish it.  They always want to diffuse and have you go off in different directions</li>
<li>PPD Vaccines.  Who are the officers in El Salvador and Columbia, Jorge--you have a chance to be a real hero.  Let&#39;s talk about hospital shifts.  Prove me right, send the information to the reporters in this group.  This is a real chance for you to expose what the State Dept / CIA is doing.</li>
<li>We had a good chat on the film about the Elites--they really don&#39;t care about anyone but the 1%.  YOu&#39;re a renowned scientist--what would it mean to the world if you lived another 20 yrs?</li>

<li> All of this activity is for elites to have eternal life</li>
<li>Knights of Malta.  When Clinton Foundation shut down the CGI, which is really going to be reformed by Rockefeller and Google foundation, I proposed the question: did they go to Malta?</li>
<li>Malta can issue diplomatic passports so you can bypass the security lines.  Here are all the countries they have diplomatic relationships with.  And Canada is one</li>
<li> If you are jewish you know this.  The maltese falcon is a bird you could put in the window of an art shop, hospital or church and that person would accept MONEY to get out of Germany into Jewish-friendly countries.  It&#39;s to let everyone know you can get letters of transit if you could pay that extortion money to escape.</li>
<li>Reason I mention it is the Knights of the Grand Master of Malta resigned today.  The Pope is saying he&#39;s going to take control of the Order of Knights of Malta.  It&#39;s not actually part of the Catholic Church, but it&#39;s always been the military wing of the Catholic Church.  These guys were assassins.  They called them knights of Justice; popes were killing each other and so forth. It&#39;s been a spy ring for a long time {{Jesuits}} and in recent times, since war of 1812 it&#39;s been a way to spirit away rich people who are in trouble with the law.  It&#39;s been a ratline for trafficking for a long time.  SO when the CIA goes to find a network, the CIA doesn&#39;t go to the Church to pray--they go because they want letters of introduction, letters of transit</li>
<li>FBI dominates in the US, so CIA inserts itself into Canada.  All the MKULTRA experiments are done in Quebec. And CSIS [Canadian Secret Intelligence Service] is a very strong partner of the CIA<sup><sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CIA_activities_in_Canada">[]</a><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canadian_Security_Intelligence_Service">[]</a></sup></sup></li>
<li>Email releases and George found **3 missing 302s&quot; Jack Lew.  He went through 178 pages</li>
<li>George&#39;s missing 302&#39;s deduction / heuristics and speculations</li>
<li>Jack Lew and Denis McDonough are the two fixers who blocked Amb. Christopher Stevens&#39; <em>600 calls</em> the week [of the Benghazi incident]</li>
<li><strong>Organ Watch</strong> organization is run by an anthropologist from Berkeley, <strong>Nancy Scheper-Hughes</strong></li>
<li>2009 Case called the Rosenbaum Case involving organs</li>
<li>People like this give just enough information to make it not look like a big network</li>
<li>George believes CENTCOM is going to be behind all the UAE transplants and the doctors coming back and forth</li>
<li>You need a cover when you get an organ transplant, but you don&#39;t need that in UAE</li>
<li>One of the interns that was blocked in Trump&#39;s ban is a UAE doctor that is suing Trump now</li>
<li>Nancy Scheper-Hughes wrote the book, <em><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Commodifying-Published-association-Culture-Society/dp/0761940340/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1486391574&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=commodifying+bodies">Commodifying Bodies</a></em> in 2009, which discusses how medical transplantation technology improvements is creating more war through the profit motive of organ harvesting</li>
<li>Hospital ships are going to be used for organ transplant for the elite</li>
<li>VA hospital through OHS contracts is going to be responsible for logistics of scheduling.  VA scheduling problems are from prioritizing the elites [skipping the line]</li>
<li>Swiss SYNTEK vaccine testing</li>
<li>Once you compromise the police and military [and set up the organ system], then you can export this [turnkey] system to other governments with foreign officers, and saying &#39;hey we have this plan for eternal life&#39;; and if he can use his own country&#39;s people&#39;s organs for the elite, then that&#39;s a key brokering leverage</li>
<li>I&#39;m more sure than ever that USAID is the service setting up kids for vaccines and moving them to remote areas where they can be harvested</li>
<li>The &quot;us think&quot;, the MIC, &quot;our people&quot;, the CIA, we&#39;re going to create this waystation or retreat in case anything goes wrong.  We&#39;re going to have this plan for longer life, and we&#39;re going to have underground railroads to take it from somebody else at no charge to ourselves.  This &#39;co-opting&#39; idea that runs through the CIA</li>

<li>OTPOR / DISRUPT and NATO countermove recap</li>
<li>After putting down OTPOR revolt, you will have soldiers in the area you can retrain as police {{mercenaries}} to do organized crime-- via Dyncorp contracts</li>
<li>Popovic from OTPUR has a nice PR presence, but he leads these hate sessions in Kosovo, gets them to think organ harvesting from enemies is OK.</li>
<li>They use the kids for sex stings and then have revenge groups to &#39;harvest them&#39;.  But there aren&#39;t enough sicko/pedos that they have to go after innocent people, by gaslighting the revenge groups into having a revenge motive for harvesting innocent people {{maybe those people are then outed as murderers for other revenge gangs, continuing the cycle?}}</li>
<li>The Army Intelligence is the precursor to OSS which is the precursor to the CIA.  It&#39;s basically Wall St. versus the FBI. FBI has always had this anti-communist [drive]. CIA has always been Wall St&#39;s pet.</li>
<li>Organ Transplants has been off-the-charts this year.</li>
<li>The availability of organs has skyrocketted because young kids doing opiod overdoses, providing otherwise healthy organs. 75,000 people waiting for organs in the US</li>
<li>This is this culture of organs created by Charles Lindberg</li>
<li><em>Charles Lindberg Worked on a Heart Bypass Pump that Enabled the Open Heart Surgery With Nobel Prize Winner Alexis Carrel</em></li>
<li>What the CIA does, or back then Army Intelligence, would find something a person invented, and pair the inventer up with a Nobel Prize Winner to legitimize the research, legitimize the Rockefeller institute</li>
<li>You find the same thing happening at Wake Forest where they are trying to 3D print kidneys</li>
<li>New technique Profusion desecularization for using a stem cells wash with organ cells to regrow the organ</li>
<li>Laura Silsby hospital&#39;s sick kids are going to Mirabalais for a cat scanner.  [Mirabalais] has been fogged out in {{google?}} photographs.  The cat scanner is actually sizing-up the kids&#39; organs to find out if the donor is a match.</li>
<li>Clinic in Milotte admits to doing heart transplants, five or six being done right now.</li>
<li>Africa is going to be the source for the ME for organs.  Kosovo for Europe and NATO.  Haiti is going to be a human experimentation place for vaccines and virus testing.  Bodybags going both ways.  Both a source of organs and a source of research.</li>
<li>Cathy O&#39;Brian is a CIA whistleblower who has admitted the drug running and virus testing in Haiti as historical precedent</li>
<li>George is folowing USAID spending, tied to Alephantis via Sislby</li>
<li>Homan Square, Chicago &#39;secret blackops prison&#39;, where they are doing torture and finding  out whole families to put on a target list, just like they did Vietnam, then they are doing organ harvesting.</li>
<li>Doug Valentine, <em>&quot;The Phoenix Program&quot;</em></li>
<li>Nelson Brickham &quot;Yale Antrhopologist&quot; Author of the CIA Phoenix Program in Vietnam</li>
<li>The phoenix program was a civilian psychological harassment program of political adversaries that ruined people&#39;s lives and inhibited people from getting government assistance until they were homeless and died.</li>
<li>There was also weird experiments where they put electrodes into political prisoner&#39;s brains</li>
<li>&quot;Maximizing the ROI for the topple&quot; -- the fusion centers are used to round up people, put them into torture centers just like the Phoenix program</li>
<li>George believes Laura Silsby were taking the kids to the NE corner of Dominican Republic to organ transfer facilities</li>
<li>OHS -- could also stand for Organ Harvesting Services</li>

    <div class="md"><p>You know Polo I was thinking the same thing.  I just ...  it made me sigh.  I don&#39;t know if there&#39;s an honest filmmaker in hollywood that can help him...thats the fundamental problem.</p>

<p>I think his &#39;hidden history of the us&#39; is a little too discovery channel and it doesn&#39;t really capture it</p>

<p>if a person wanted to do hidden history of the US, they&#39;d start with this cadre of subverts in the intelligence community.  I would say Dulles and operation paperclip is a good starting point, but if you really wanted to go deeper: </p>

<p>Cecil Rhodes and Rhodesia and the formation of round table supranationals.</p>

<p>And if you wanted to go deeper: freemasonry, adam weishaupt, rousseau and voltaire and the french revolution; origins of democratic republicanism and basically follow Grant Morrison&#39;s lead on histroy of US as given by the graphic novel &quot;the invisibles&quot; which is a more honest account of the US than what we think of as history, even tho invisibles is weird and has demons and such</p>

<p>Then to go even deeper, tie into rosicrucianism, jesuits, evolution of science and the enlightenment  science vs theology for cultural supremacy...it&#39;s really masons versus jesuits and goes back to venice, malta, switzerland heidelberg and prague, london and paris</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The best part there is how it illustrates the never ending nature of the same conflict, and you can see why in mythology it&#39;s always just good vs evil, with each side thinking they are good and then whoever wins then becomes the evil god or ruler. Like Zeus conquering the old Gods before him and so on. So the the Gods rule from Olympus until the &quot;good&quot; reforms and battles again, ad infinitum. The comic Spawn is also the same idea, with heaven and hell recruiting their people to fight the other and Spawn was actually a CIA agent in Vietnam! I sometimes wonder if comics aren&#39;t intended to be the &quot;official history&quot; for way into the future lol. In the Wire remember the character known only as the Greek? </p>

<p>But this has racked my brain and spins me in circles, so I stay depressed and hopeless, but just trying to figure out the telos and the point of it all, if it&#39;s even worth it. Like if the end state is to be a god or a star, for the good to become the bad Gods and so on, does it make you want to just disconnect from this game and refuse to play it? Then be a bystander who does nothing which is just as pointless as any other option? I feel like Leonardo DiCaprio at the end of Shutter Island, just give me the lobotomy! </p>
