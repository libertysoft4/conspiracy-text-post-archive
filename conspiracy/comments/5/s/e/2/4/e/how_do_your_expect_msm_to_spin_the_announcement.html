    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve been thinking about this for the last couple of days. Because I know if the arrests are coming I&#39;m going to call in, get fucking wasted and scream on every social network &quot;fuck you&quot; to all my liberal friends, especially the ones that shamed me for not voting for Hillary.</p>

<p>Then I thought, oh fuck what if they do a pizzagate switcharoo and label it as an alt right thing. Honestly I could see it happening, the MSM comparing it to what hitler did or whatever. I know I will stand my ground and be sure to shame every kiddy fucker apologist to hell. </p>

<p>These people probably have one last trick up their sleeve, I&#39;m thinking it&#39;s not going to matter/be effective. They went so hard with the Russian hacking and pissgate but no one thinks about it anymore. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>If there&#39;s been one theme with Trump, it has to be his enemies taking shots and ending up shooting themselves in the foot. Literally NOTHING anyone has tried has worked. The grab em by the pussy thing helped him and he reframed it to call Bill Clinton a rapist. I suspect there will be (basically) undeniable evidence, weather it be WikiLeaks releasing something on top of people getting arrested, project veritas showing some CNN bs...Etc. And whatever move &quot;they/ptb&quot; try will be the final nail in their coffin.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I just treat them as sociopaths and never contact ever again.  Even if they aren&#39;t directly an ingroup globalist psychopath keyed into the agenda, they are sociopaths by being so willfully, obstinately resistant to new information that is emminently available to them, that they are effectively inculcated into a cult of fact-free ideology.  This makes them as absolutely dangerous, toxic to your future in their judgements and decision-making, that they are going to end up harming you and your families later on down the line.  It&#39;s best to cut your losses, and find friends that willing to listen and debate using logic, rhetoric and reason, despite their ideology.  </p>

<p>Just to be clear: I&#39;m not talking about labelling a person a sociopath because you disagree with them; or because you&#39;re a conservative and don&#39;t like liberals.  I&#39;m talking about this dangerous new breed of person. </p>

<p>I&#39;m talking about labelling someone a sociopath because they are caught in the event horizon of infinite ignorance from which they not only can&#39;t escape, they won&#39;t even try, they won&#39;t learn, they won&#39;t show any effort to knowing actual historical facts.  Nationalistic, authoritarian, anti-sense, anti-intellectual liberals who think ends justify the means, and that social justice is more important than criminal justice, when in fact they are equally important.  </p>

<p>They just want to cry and blamethrow and make everyone aroudn them wrong, and that behavior is a very dangerous social disorder which can only be remedied by shunning and blackballing.  They&#39;ll be fine though.  Clearly the Soros&#39;es of the world have infinite amounts of money to corrupt our youth in this way--and don&#39;t think you can &quot;save them&quot;--they&#39;re already gone.</p>

<p>It&#39;s like in lifeguarding, if you see someone kicking around and flailing in the water, you let them go under and basically drown, then pull them ashore and administer mouth to mouth, otherwise they&#39;ll take you down with them and you both die. It&#39;s a tough call, but it&#39;s the right one.  After all, it&#39;s these sociopaths that put themselves ever-willingly into the deep end of this mess, by not communicating properly and falling for each and every confidence game of the globalist elites, encumbrancing them with layers of illusion and delusion of media brainwashing, for years.  It&#39;s their fault they didn&#39;t question a damned thing at all.  Don&#39;t blame the game blame the lemming.</p>

It finally came to a head and I ask him why he&#39;s so proud of the fact that he willingly accepts everything the media tells him to. He laughs and says &quot;I guess I am a little proud of it.

    <div class="md"><p>They&#39;ll spin it as a coup. This is what happens. It happened right here, in Brazil, where our president was democratically and legally impeached, following all of the legal steps.</p>

<p>And stupid people were out on the streets saying they didn&#39;t vote for the VP, which replaced the president. The stupidity goes far.</p>

<p>What I&#39;m most scared is of false flags. You want to get Trump impeached? Use a false flag and frame Trump for it. It would fit the general conspiracy narrative. The MSN would say that Trump is so delusional he orchestrated a false flag to prove his points. It would be done in a matter of days.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I would urge everyone to act with integrity and calmness if (when hopefully) this is the case. MSM MAY continue to spew lies. I certainly hope not, but it&#39;s entirely possible. If this is the case then your lib/SJW flower friends will probably continue to adhere to MSM&#39;s story either out of shame or stupidity. But if you calmly and intelligently approach them, maybe you can bring them around (if they don&#39;t fall in the utterly stupid category). If you scream at them, you alienate them and add to this divisive rhetoric that&#39;s become such a huge problem. If this blows up... be the bigger person, guys. It benefits everyone. </p>

I don&#39;t think Hillary (and the others) will go willingly and I sort of have been playing with the thought that she will do something similar to what Cersei Lannister did at the end of the last GoT season.

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve been wondering. Would it be better to start slow and take down one or two nobody&#39;s, and slowly turn up the heat of the investigation. Or to grab everyone at once to keep anyone from running or destroying evidence. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t think the MSM will make any announcement whatsoever, be it arrests for the Clintons or the Queen of England.  The media doesn&#39;t want to undermine the public&#39;s faith in democratic institutions or hurt their national pride, which would hurt economies.  Trials are likely to be kept private and hidden.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Jim stone insists that the day Hillary almost fainted at the 9-11 memorial and was &quot;chucked into the side of a van&quot; (as the_donald puts it) was actually video of her arrest. That she was cuffed and needed help getting in the van because the handcuffs. </p>

<p>I&#39;d expect arrests like that to be hidden for as much time as possible. No one&#39;s seem Huma abedin after her husband got busted there was a few clips of her out and about but crying, then nothing. Was she arrested?</p>
