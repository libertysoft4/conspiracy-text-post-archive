    <div class="md"><p>Trump said he &quot;respects Putin as a leader of his country&quot;.... Not understanding all the hoopla over this statement. Trumps goal is to make America SAFE again, by eliminating terrorist organizations, which he feels Putin/Russia could greatly contribute with. So, what exactly do people want? Trump to spew hate against Putin? Say &quot;well you&#39;re just such a horrible person we don&#39;t want anything to do with you (Russia) &amp; just ignore them? Because that&#39;s not gonna work.

    <div class="md"><p>There&#39;s a HUGE difference in love &amp; respect. He respects him as a LEADER, not necessarily as a person. I definitely don&#39;t understand how you feel our leader having respect for another leader jeopardizes your personal freesom....Or what particular freedoms you feel are at risk. It&#39;s kind of like life, and learning to get along with those we don&#39;t like, maybe a co-worker. Would you not say you respected your co-worker as a co-worker, even if you didn&#39;t care for them personally? People are unfortunately so swayed by the lying, biased media they actually believe Trump is going to be the next Hitler. That&#39;s outrageous!!! Our system of government has many checks and balances in place. Just like the EO banning the 7 countries. Some people didn&#39;t agree.... Appeared before a judge....Ban placed on hold. I find it interesting you chose not to comment about all the time/money HRC spent with &quot;killers&quot; a lot worse than Putin....Of course, the streets weren&#39;t filled with protesters during that time either. Imagine that?!?  As far as the Patriot Act, I see both sides of the spectrum. Unfortunately some freedom will have to be sacrificed for safety. So, ask yourself which is more important? Personally, freedoms no good if I&#39;m dead bc our country is no longer safe &amp; full of terrorists. I&#39;d be willing to sacrifice a certain amount of freedom to ensure my daughter sees her 20&#39;s/30&#39;s/40&#39;s.</p>

It&#39;s more that an increasing fear along with love of a &quot;strong man&quot; leader is going to lead us to accepting more freedoms being taken away - same with what happened with the Patriot Act.  I feel like I&#39;m watching this happen and no one is paying attention.  </p>

<p>Think whatever you want on whether or not working with Putin can contribute to stopping terrorism.  American&#39;s admiring him as someone to look up to as a leader is what is scary.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m no right-winger, and Putin is exceptionally rational however authoritarian he is or isn&#39;t, or is made to appear.  The Maidan incident shows that he is the target of covert operations to <em>frame him</em> as autocratic.</p>

<p>After Bush/Cheney breached the post-WW2 &quot;Old World Order&quot; in which &quot;Pre-emptive War&quot; was the highest war crime (according to Nuremberg prosecutor Robert H. Jackson), Putin was the last major leader upholding the Old World Order.  Obama took Bush&#39;s side.  This is the reason for NATO&#39;s Ukraine coup:  to finally taint the clean Putin by forcing him to defend his only southern port access.</p>

<p>Putin&#39;s record on human rights is worthy of discussion, but not by the filthy U.S. who are only more covert with their journalist assassinations, and better at whitewashing their gulags &amp; war crimes.  Putin is not even in the league of the U.S. when it comes to war crimes or conspiracies or oligarchy or a one-party system.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It probably won&#39;t happen yet, but it seems obvious that that powers controlling Trump will conduct a false flag attack, and blame Iran for it. Trump needs something to justify his planned Iran invasion. If he wasn&#39;t so eager to attack Iran, Israel wouldn&#39;t have installed him as President in the first place. But he needs an attack to justify the coming war. </p>
