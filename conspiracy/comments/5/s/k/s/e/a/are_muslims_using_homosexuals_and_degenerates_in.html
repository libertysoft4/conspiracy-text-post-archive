<p>Wut?  Lot happened to move into and live in the city of Sodom, but it wasn&#39;t like they were &quot;his people&quot;.  The men of Sodom specifically call him a sojourner.  That means he was someone from out of town.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>And they said, Stand back.  And they said again, This one fellow came in to sojourn, and he will needs be a judge: now will we deal worse with thee, than with them.  And they pressed sore upon the man, even Lot, and came near to break the door. (Genesis 19:9)</p>

<p>The &quot;people of Lot&quot; would be the Moabites and Ammonites, the peoples that came from the sons he had with his daughters.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No duh, the old testament started being written <em>2000 years before Christ walked the earth</em>.  There&#39;s no such thing as a &quot;gospel of Jesus&quot; book.  Jesus was a prophet, not a scribe.  He came to reinforce that the law and the prophets were his words, not write new ones.  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Think not that I am come to destroy the law, or the prophets: I am not come to destroy, but to fulfil.  For verily I say unto you, Till heaven and earth pass, one jot or one tittle shall in no wise pass from the law, till all be fulfilled. (Matthew 5:17-18)</p>

<p>How can ye believe, which receive honour one of another, and seek not the honour that cometh from God only?  Do not think that I will accuse you to the Father: there is one that accuseth you, even Moses, in whom ye trust.  For had ye believed Moses, ye would have believed me: for he wrote of me.  But if ye believe not his writings, how shall ye believe my words? (John 5:44-47)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Is it clear that the law and the prophets were around before Christ walked the earth?  Do you need a timeline?  The gospels are the written testimonies of other people <em>of</em> Jesus which were written after he ascended.  You&#39;re looking for something the Bible doesn&#39;t assert exists in order to prove the Bible?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, the psychopaths that control the American government give no excuses to anyone for anything and will keep mass murdering Middle Easterners if they are allowed to. I genuinely hate the fact that it&#39;s happening but I can&#39;t change it currently. Violence against American civilians will only &#39;justify&#39; the mass murder of Middle Easterners further, esp once our corrupt media gets ahold of it and spins it to the government&#39;s advantage. That&#39;s only helping to perpetuate the problem instead of helping fix it by dealing with the root of it.</p>

<p>I&#39;m a 1000% against America&#39;s wars in the MidEast, and so are many of the people that I know, but we can&#39;t realitically stop it right now. I guess I can&#39;t argue with you if you think that killing us is the solution but it won&#39;t achieve anything besides getting more of your people killed and getting more Americans to support a war machine that you literally have close to zero chance against. </p>

<p>From my analysis every time we do a &quot;terrorist attack&quot; the enemies of Islam unite to fight us. If we leave them alone you attack each other. </p>

<p>So no need to worry too much about terrorism because we notice it is more productive to leave you alone. Our &quot;terrorism&quot; unites you against us.</p>

<p>That is actually one of our attack vectors. Spend $1 on a terrorist attack incite a $1 million dollar response. Repeat. The fact that the US is trillions in debt shows that it is working.</p>

<p>Yeah it comes out of the pockets of average citizens in the form of taxes, inflation, ect. Which we hope will eventually cause a rebellion and topple the governments of the world. You aren&#39;t poor enough to rebel yet but that is a goal.</p>

<p>Their primary goal is to prevent the reestablishment of an Islamic Caliphate.</p>

<p>It seems like they are failing because we are half way there. If we can get the Muslims in MENA to see the Caliphate as a legitimate entity and to merge their territories then no government would ever be able to take us on.</p>

<p>This map was probably made by a racist but its a pretty good indication of our goal to unite the Muslim majority nations into a single global Caliphate:

<p>There&#39;s been more than enough pain and death and separation. Our real enemies delight in humanity&#39;s quarrels and consolidate power while we fight, and a rebelling American populace nor a renewed caliphate is enough to stop them. We must all work together. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Who do you think is funding the calipate?  So you consider the princes and enemy that you would remove if you had the opportunity?  That kind of sounds like the flawed democracy you denounce.  You don&#39;t think we consider the the dark state(plutocrats who rule our politicians)our enemy,and that we would remove them if given the opportunity?  Again your reasoning is flawed, just like any religious zealot.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, the psychopaths that control the American government give no excuses to anyone for anything and will keep mass murdering Middle Easterners if they are allowed to. I genuinely hate the fact that it&#39;s happening but I can&#39;t change it currently. Violence against American civilians will only &#39;justify&#39; the mass murder of Middle Easterners further, esp once our corrupt media gets ahold of it and spins it to the government&#39;s advantage. That&#39;s only helping to perpetuate the problem instead of helping fix it by dealing with the root of it.</p>

<p>I&#39;m a 1000% against America&#39;s wars in the MidEast, and so are many of the people that I know, but we can&#39;t realitically stop it right now. I guess I can&#39;t argue with you if you think that killing us is the solution but it won&#39;t achieve anything besides getting more of your people killed and getting more Americans to support a war machine that you literally have close to zero chance against. </p>
