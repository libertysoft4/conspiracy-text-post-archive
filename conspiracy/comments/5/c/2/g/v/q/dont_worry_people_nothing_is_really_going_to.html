    <div class="md"><p><a href="https://notpoliticallycorrect.me/2016/07/11/the-evolution-of-morality/">Morality is subjective.</a> </p>

<p>Moral reasoning is just a post hoc search for reasons to justify the judgments people have already made. When people are asked why, for certain questions, they find things morally wrong, they say they cannot think of a reason but they still think it is wrong. This has been verified by numerous studies. Moral reasoning evolved as a skill to further social cohesiveness and to further our social agendas. Even in different cultures, those with matching socioeconomic levels have the same moral reasoning. Morality cannot be entirely constructed by children based on their own understanding of harm. Thus, cultural learning must play a bigger role than the rationalists had given it. Larger and more complex brains also show more cognitive sophistication in making choices and judgments, confirming a theory of mine that larger brains are the cause of making correct choices as well as making moral judgments.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If you think that moral reasoning is something we do to figure out truth, you’ll be constantly frustrated by how foolish, biased, and illogical people become when they disagree with you. <strong><em>But if you think about moral reasoning as a skill we humans evolved to further our social agendas – to justify our own actions and to defend the teams we belong to – then things will make a lot more sense. Keep your eye on the intuitions, and don’t take people’s moral arguments at face value. They’re mostly post hoc constructions made up on the fly crafted to advance one or more strategic objectives (Haidt, 2012, pg XX to XXI).</em></strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>There is no way to quantify morals. Who&#39;s right? Who&#39;s wrong? What one believes comes down to evolution. </p>

<p>Thanks for playing. You’re too stupid to be considered human and certainly incapable of comprehending any conversation on any topic whatsoever. Literally no one, anywhere, who is given any measure of serious thought, believes that morality is subjective.</p>

<p>The four fundamental forces of physics are objectively measured as what they are. They are immutable constants. From them, all physical reality is defined and described. Said physical reality is consistently measurable, and is thus objective in its format and design. Taken to its conclusion, we can state unequivocally: “Some actions are ALWAYS good. Some actions are ALWAYS bad.”</p>

<p>Thus morality is objective.</p>

<p>Doesn&#39;t follow. You can&#39;t define &quot;good&quot; or &quot;bad&quot;. 1) Populations evolved differently in comparison to others based on different environmental selection pressures. Surely, since there are innate differences in the brain, then there will be differences in morality and moral reasoning between and within populations. Therefore, morality is subjective. This has been empirically verified. People have different moral views depending on culture (which is an expression of genetics). People cannot logically reason &quot;why&quot; they fell some way, it&#39;s just their intuition telling them they&#39;re wrong.</p>

<p>Empirically tested. Read the article.</p>

<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><em>The illusions of moral judgment</em>. If moral reasoning is generally
a post hoc construction intended to justify automatic moral
intuitions, then our moral life is plagued by two illusions. The first
illusion can be called the <em>wag-the-dog illusion</em>: We believe that our
own moral judgment (the dog) is driven by our own moral reasoning
(the tail). The second illusion can be called the <em>wag-theother-dog&#39;s-tail
illusion</em>: In a moral argument, we expect the
successful rebuttal of an opponent&#39;s arguments to change the
opponent&#39;s mind. Such a belief is like thinking that forcing a dog&#39;s
tail to wag by moving it with your hand will make the dog happy</p>

<p>By knowing and understanding how evolution works.</p>

<p>Culture is an expression of genetics. There are differences in the brain between cultures which is how culture gets expressed due to evolution in that area. Since morality starts in the brain, there are differences between groups of people that were genetically isolated.</p>

<p>Not relevant to the discussion.</p>

<p>It doesn’t follow. Morality exists as an immutable constant, by the definitions previously presented. That actions within a society deviate from that morality does not make the morality itself mutable.</p>

<p>Once again, we return to the flawed marxist thought that the “Individual” is the atom of a society. If you do not already know the reasons that the anecdote therein is false, we return to my original statement: you are incapable of having any conversation on the topic as you do not believe something which is unquestionably true.</p>

<p>Me, a Marxist? Funniest thing I&#39;ve ever heard. I&#39;m so far right from Marxists it&#39;s not even funny. Morality evolved as an in-group behavior to help the tribe survive better.</p>

<p>I am extremely right-wing. I&#39;m no where near Marxism.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Explain how 1. it is not and 2. it should not be.</p>

<p>Explain how? By seeing how peoples differ in behavior and culture across the planet. Person A thinks what they do is wrong. Person B says they are right in what they do. Society A thinks this is right, Society B thinks that&#39;s wrong and doesn&#39;t do it.</p>

<p>Some Asian countries eat dogs, we look at it as disgusting but to them it&#39;s just another meal. Are they &quot;wrong&quot; in eating dogs? Or is it just a way to survive. The point of morality&#39;s evolution was to better help the gene survive. Go read Richard Dawkins&#39;s &quot;The Selfish Gene&quot; and come back to me.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>No, does.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Everyone doesn&#39;t morally reason the same.</p>

<p>If everyone morally reasoned the same then there would be no differences in so-called &quot;moral behaviors&quot; if this were true. Moral reasoning is not the same between peoples. Therefore the differences between peoples come down to evolution. Since culture is genetic, then evolutionary selection pressures occurred and they responded by evolving differing physical <em>and mental</em> traits. Since morality begins in the brain and there are brain differences between peoples, morality is subjective and not objective.</p>

<p>Moral relativism is definitionally left-wing. It is the FOUNDATION of liberal thought.</p>

<p>Differences in behavior ≠ differences in morality. The sky is still blue regardless of if someone else calls it green.</p>

<p>That has nothing to do with morality.</p>

<p>That’s correct. There is no difference in moral behaviors. Morality is objective. That people act in contradiction to that which is objectively morally good DOES NOT MEAN that morality itself has changed. You’re literally falling for a fucking appeal to majority.</p>

<p>Good one. Again, since evolution occurred differently for different people, there will be moral differences between them, and this has been empirically verified, which if you&#39;d have read the links you were provided you&#39;d see that.</p>

<p>It&#39;s a moral question. Are Asian people in Asian countries who consume dogs &quot;wrong&quot; in what they do?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>That people act in contradiction to that which is objectively morally good DOES NOT MEAN that morality itself has changed. You’re literally falling for a fucking appeal to majority.</p>

<p>Moral reasoning is just a post hoc search for reasons to justify the judgments people have already made. People search for reasons AFTER they already have done them in justification for their actions.</p>

<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Julie and Mark are brother and sister. They are traveling together in France on summer vacation from college. One night they are staying alone in a cabin near the beach. They decide that it would be interesting and fun if they tried making love. At the very least, it would be a new experience for each of them. Julie was already taking birth control pills, but Mark uses a condom too, just to be safe. They both enjoy making love, but they decide never to do it again. They keep that night as a special secret, which makes them feel even closer to each other. What do you think about that? Was it ok for them to make love?&quot;</p>

<p>If you&#39;re like most people, your response is &quot;absolutely not,&quot; but you&#39;ll find it more difficult than you think to come up with a justification. &quot;Genetic defects from inbreeding.&quot; Yes, but they were using two forms of birth control. (And in the vanishingly small chance of pregnancy, Julie can get an abortion.) &quot;It will mess them up emotionally.&quot; On the contrary, they enjoyed the act and it brought them closer together. &quot;It&#39;s illegal.&quot; Not in France. &quot;It&#39;s disgusting.&quot; For you, maybe, but not for them (obviously). Do you really want to say that private acts are morally wrong just because a lot of people find those acts disgusting? And so on.</p>
