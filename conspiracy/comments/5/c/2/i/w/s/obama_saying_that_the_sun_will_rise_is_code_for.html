The jigs is up and their secret society has to run for the hills. HRC was in a damned witch suit at her concession speech... Obama mentioned again and again that there needs to be a &quot;smooth transition of power&quot; but every rich white man in America is obviously about to shit their pants in distress. The mainstream media is still fighting the truth because the entertainment industry has so many of the Illuminati that they need some time to GTFO of America lest they be arrested. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Once the sun has risen from the West, the door of repentance for sins committed will be closed by Allah and will remain closed until the Day of Judgement. The following Hadiths clearly specify that the deadline for repentance to be accepted by God ends when the sun rises from the West. Once the sun rises from the West, repentance will no longer be accepted.</p>

<p>That interpretation could mean that they are all going to have to finally pay for their crimes related to sacrifices and such. No longer is the system rigged to protect them all. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That or this wasn&#39;t entirely planned by them at all.  They <em>planned</em> on Clinton winning.  However, it&#39;s not like now that Trump&#39;s won, that somehow ruins all the plans they had.  I&#39;m sure they have plans upon plans upon contingency plans and either way it goes, they make sure their interests are met.</p>

<p>It&#39;s a long run thing with them.  People have to understand that the interests of these elites are multigenerational, so it actually doesn&#39;t matter if they have plans that actually get legitimately foiled for a presidential cycle or two.  They can sit it out and wait and be patient until their ideal time comes.</p>

<p>It&#39;s not like they&#39;re in charge of EVERYTHING.  They&#39;re not.  It&#39;s a give and take power struggle that goes on, and even if the dark side doesn&#39;t gain the day in one moment, it doesn&#39;t mean that they can&#39;t come back and take it the next.</p>

<p>And, to be sure, it&#39;s not like Trump winning means that the dark side was &quot;foiled&quot;.</p>

<p>Trump very much <em>IS</em> the fucking dark side too.  He&#39;s just a different facet of it than Clinton.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t think they planned on it either, but I don&#39;t think they honesty saw this coming enough to have a huge playbook... you can tell from newscaster there wasnt an alternate script.  they are old school and really bad at the internet... a spot where the all seeing eye couldn&#39;t really see much. They have tons of plans... from the news it sounds like they want to kill Trump... maybe on 5th or 15th floor of his building. FBI is got shit running tight... airspace shut down. Rockblocks... the FBI is trying to take care of any threats. </p>

<p>Anything to shake up the power dynamic is entertaining for me... I don&#39;t care how it affects their &quot;daughters&quot;. But in the end if they are eating children and get caught red handed by the entire world on the internet... then maybe it is time for a regime change into a secret society better at staying secret cause I&#39;m fine with just the illusion to freedom. </p>

<p>I just…don’t understand this.  Why on Earth would anyone be knowledgeably okay with being enslaved and retarded in their growth?</p>

<p>I prefer hard, inconvenient, even painful truth to soft, convenient lies every time.  10/10.</p>

<p>Lies (which illusions are 100%) ensure that you don’t grow and evolve as a being.  Truth, no matter how difficult, will <em>always</em> ensure that you move forward and evolve even if it’s difficult and not easy.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah. This is how I got into these sort of topics to begin with was because I was questioning my whole reality and the fact that society fucking sucks. Why? Why do we live these constrained lives where we&#39;re are eternal slaves to a piece of green paper with fake value? Because the strings are pulled, and if we were able to break free, and establish a revolutionized change in how society operates then we could free ourselves from this constraint and build a system that works based on real humane aspects &amp; teachings. We should be able to live our lives with our families &amp; loved ones and gaining knowledge to further advance our species. Not being indebted to this slave system. Initially when you bring out these questions people will react with things like &quot;The world would go caput if we didn&#39;t do things the way they are!&quot; How do they know? They don&#39;t. They&#39;re so washed in their captivity that they believe in the system to be their only way of life when essentially that is not true at all. </p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>I was just saying that for me personally.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Even just for you personally though.  Truth - even hard, painful, inconvenient truth - is always, <em>always</em> better than nice, soft, convenient lies.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>it would feel more comfortable to buy into a new more-plausible false reality.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You only <em>think</em> it would.</p>

<p>This is like saying that doing nothing but sitting on a couch and each chips and ice cream all day would be ideal.</p>

<p>Ice cream and chips might taste good, but you’ll end up like <a href="https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/originals/ea/e6/50/eae65005095509d73ee92f14ab678d50.jpg">this</a> and you’ll probably have a short, not very good quality of life that way.  If you’re regularly active, however - even if you don’t necessarily <em>want</em> to be and you’d rather sit home and eat ice cream and chips - it’ll ultimately be better and healthier for you overall.</p>

<p>This is just an analogy, of course, but it applies to doing the right/proper things even if they’re hard over doing the wrong things even if they’re easy.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>than it would be to exist in this one and have the truth covered up by tptb.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But when the truth is covered up by TPTB then you’re STILL living in a lie.  It’s not like we’re living in a world of truth here.</p>

<p>However, if you <em>know</em> you’re being lied to, then you can at least do what you can to educate yourself and at least attempt to uncover the truth…as opposed to continuing to live in a lie that might ultimately be causing you more harm than good.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>but I&#39;m very new to these kinds of existential musings... so I&#39;m not really sure how I&#39;ll feel about it as things unfold.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Fair enough, but know that truth is ALWAYS superior to untruths.</p>

<p>It’s this analogy:</p>

<p>Would you rather have a wife that <em>seems</em> like the “perfect” wife, but who is in reality lying to you and is fucking other people behind your back?</p>

<p>or would you rather have a wife that isn’t the “perfect” wife, and you guys occasionally argue, etc…but she’s truthful and honest and doesn’t lie to you or bullshit you and you KNOW what you’re getting with her at least?</p>

<p>I’m not saying that the second choice is the ideal or best one.  The best option is obviously to have a partner who is A) fucking awesome and that is the “perfect” one for you, <em>and</em> B) is also very truthful and doesn’t lie to you.  However, between the two above choices, living in a lie is the far, FAR worse choice because all <em>kinds</em> of horrible things can happen that you don’t even know are happening that way.</p>

<p>Lies are just bad, man.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I&#39;ve always been driven by logic and don&#39;t really like outright lies.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But your saying that you’d rather live in a false paradigm seems to directly contradict this.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>But eventually logic overcomes cognitive dissonance.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Actually it often doesn’t.  Logic tends to be what uncovers the inconsistencies between what one <em>thinks</em> is the case and what actually <em>is</em> the actual case in reality.  Through that inconsistency, cognitive dissonance can arise.  Cognitive dissonance is that super unsettling, uncomfortable feeling when you realize and come face to face with the fact that you might have been entirely wrong about something you thought was absolutely true all along - like, for example, if you saw the girl you loved and thoughts was faithful to you all along walking down the street holding hands with another guy.  Cognitive dissonance is the thing that would try to explain that away - explain away an inconsistency between what you <em>want</em> to be the case (“She’s faithful and only has eyes for me!”) and the new information you just uncovered (she’s holding hands with another dude and obviously DOESN’T have eyes only for me).</p>

<p>The problem here is that CD often makes people side with what they <em>want</em> to be the case independent of what the facts of the matter actually point to.  In the above example, a person with CD might just go “Meh.  It’s okay.  It’s not what it looks like.  I’m sure that’s just a friend of hers and there’s nothing going on.”</p>

<p>This ends up making things worse because you’re living in a lie and not actually addressing the direct problem.</p>

<p>Okay…I’ve typed too much already.  Gonna stop for now.</p>

<p>No worries.  It’s just about trying to slowly think about the consequences of one’s thoughts and actions.</p>

<p>Like…”Where will my thoughts and actions ultimately <em>lead</em> if I continue on in this path that I&#39;m on?  Good results?  Not so good results?”  That kind of thing.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Perhaps the fact that I haven’t owned a television in coming on 18 years has helped then.</p>

<p>Scientology is a trap.  They lure you in with things that actually work from levels 1-8 (working with honesty, truth, forthrightness, emotional courage, etc), but then the deeper you get in it, the more money you&#39;re spending, AND the more dirt they&#39;ve dug up on you (they record all your intimate confessional secrets)...so you&#39;re on the hook to them via blackmail at that point and can&#39;t get out.  AND you&#39;re still paying them.</p>

<p>Shit&#39;s pretty sinister.</p>

<p>But how do they fit in to all of it? all of what?  If you&#39;re referring to the political order...well, I don&#39;t know how they fit into it, if at all.  If you&#39;re referring to the world order in general, however, I&#39;d classify them as a complicated cult designed to trap you in a web where they get more power and money from you in the process.</p>
