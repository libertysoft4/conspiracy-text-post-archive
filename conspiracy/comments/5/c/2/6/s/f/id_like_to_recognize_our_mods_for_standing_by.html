        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Over the past year, some of the largest and most popular &quot;political/current events&quot; sub-reddits were seemingly taken over by well funded political interests, but not <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>.</p>

<p>Places such as <a href="/r/SandersForPresident">/r/SandersForPresident</a>, where people had been free to discuss peaceful revolution, were unceremoniously shut down. <a href="/r/Politics">/r/Politics</a> and <a href="/r/news">/r/news</a> were seemingly overrun as old mods stepped aside and were replaced en masse, ushering in what amounted to era of censorship. Even <a href="/r/wikileaks">/r/wikileaks</a> was seemingly brought to its knees, when it had been dedicated to nothing but relaying truthful information leaked about the powers that be. </p>

<p>These giants of reddit, fell in a most spectacular fashion while <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> not only walked the path of truth but it was rewarded for it.  <strong>Our subscriber list now approaches 400,000 people</strong>.</p>

<p>This it is in large part because the mods stood by our community and listened to our concerns. It didn&#39;t matter how one was politically aligned, this subreddit remained an open arena for debate, conjecture and fact finding. Our mods provided a haven where truth seekers could present nearly any idea for discussion without fear of getting censored. </p>

<p>Thank you for giving us a sanctuary for free thinkers!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hijacking top comment.</p>

<p>So from a mod&#39;s PoV I was convinced that the community felt like the mods were being biased.</p>

<p>There is a thing that happens frequently where a post/comment violates our rule on civility and thus we remove it.  Upon removal, if the post/comment happens to also be about a specific issue or topic, as well as breaking a rule, the author frequently assumes that the issue or topic was the reason their post/comment was removed... Regardless of the fact they also told someone that they hope their children all die in a fire (just a made up example).</p>

<p>There is little chance of ever convincing the author that we moderate solely upon behavior or format (such as no memes) without consideration of the subject/issue/topic they are entwined with.</p>

<p>For those of you who fall into the above category, now this this election is over with I hope that you will reevaluate your frustration with the mods if you&#39;ve had any and understand that if every one of the 400,000 subscribers here behaved as poorly as possible (as we would allow without mod action under our current rules) <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> would be a miserable place.</p>

<p>The only reason that conspiracy is the insightful, intelligent and entertaining community that it is, is solely because 99% of you guys are conducting yourselves WELL ABOVE our established standards.  This place is nothing without you guys.  So thank all of yourselves above all else, even the minority of you who have had frustraitions with the mods.  Emotions fly sometimes (especially with election traffic happening) and we understand.</p>

<p>Keep on keeping on.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hijacking this comment.</p>

<p>Just wanted to thank you guys as well and give you all the respect I can for how well this sub was handled and moderated. I believe this sub was <em>vital</em> to the outcome of the election.</p>

<p>CTR discovered real fast that they weren&#39;t going to come in here and run shit. Anytime a thread was posted by those shills, it was gone. Anytime one of them commented, it was downvoted to the 7th circle of hell. Yet, through all of that, 95% of us remained civil, and focused on the goal of spreading information and then either confirming or debunking that info. </p>

<p>I&#39;m a chef, and we are taught about word of mouth and how powerful it is. 1 person turns into 10 turns into 100, and so on. So if your meal was good or if it sucked, 100 people will know about it before you&#39;re done mopping the kitchen. That being said...</p>

<p>r/conspiracy has 400,000 subscribers, so just sit back for a minute..all of us..and realize that while 400,000 isn&#39;t a huge number in relation to hundreds of millions, the number of people who all of us helped to wake up and inform may have very well numbered in the millions, which isn&#39;t too shabby. </p>

<p>Pat yourselves on the back mods, and redditors of r/conspiracy. We did a thing. A pretty damn big thing. And I applaud ALL OF YOU. </p>

<p>There have been some truly controversial subjects that show up that drive people nuts or incite anger, but you&#39;ve kept your hands off and let the community deal with it as we see fit.

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;d like to say thank you to all of them as well. This past year has been a MAJOR eye opener for me. I wen&#39;t from really only getting my news sources from MSM and some TYT to finding you guys and doing research on my own. It&#39;s a much more comprehensive way of attaining knowledge on current events, and NONE of it would&#39;ve been possible were it not for the moderators sticking to their guns and letting us do our thing un-adulterated. </p>

<p>So once again, thank you to the moderators as well as the community for everything. I feel like we&#39;ve had a major victory last night, and once all the celebrating is done it&#39;ll be time to get back to work. The ball is rolling, and we need to keep striking and informing others of whats REALLY going on where MSM fails to do so. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Agree.    This election period,  the r/conspiracy sub retained a degree of restraint from heavy handedness that we should remember as a gold standard.   Yes,  this place is always a minefield,  but the users helped by doing a fairly good job of referring to the &quot;NEW&quot; list,  and so the front page was usually digestible as well.   There really is no better way to stay informed than on r/conspiracy,  as imperfect as it may seem.    Each of us has to take some responsibility for telling shit from shinola.</p>

<p>I can&#39;t agree with that if you mean that &quot;ALL wealthy people are &quot;the enemy&quot;&quot;.  If that is indeed your meaning, you&#39;re just picking a different reason to be prejudice.  It&#39;s different but very similar to saying &quot;ALL black people are the enemy&quot; or &quot;ALL Christian people are the enemy&quot;.</p>
