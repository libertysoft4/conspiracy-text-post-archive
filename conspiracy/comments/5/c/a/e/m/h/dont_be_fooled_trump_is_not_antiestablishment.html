    <div class="md"><p>^ This is the message.</p>

<p>Trump was NOT elected because he, <em>as a human being</em>, possesses any special qualities.</p>

<p>This election was NOT about promoting Trump and his &quot;virtues&quot;. It was about <strong>OPPOSING</strong> the corruption, graft and tyranny that Hillary represented SO WELL. </p>

<p>Trump, as <em>&quot;the opposition&quot;</em> was, <strong><em>and is</em></strong>, merely a convenient unifying <strong>SYMBOL</strong> that The People could rally around to oppose the ruinous corruption that pervades BOTH parties and the entire Establishment.</p>

<p>Over the past year, a great awakening has happened, and the momentum generated is NOT attached to Trump, or to any human: <strong>It will continue, with or without him</strong>.</p>

<p>If Trump was a Trojan Horse - if he betrays the will of The People - he should be VERY aware that HE and his cronies will be exposed, opposed and NEUTRALIZED with all of the energy that crushed the corrupt Hillary Machine, and more. <strong>MUCH MORE</strong>.</p>

<p>We have come to a crossroads: Humanity will either evolve to a higher level, or perish by our own foolish hands. If Trump wants to participate in this existentially essential evolution, GREAT!</p>

<p>If not, he should know that he, like Hillary and others that have thrived on greed, graft and corruption, will be ground into powder. </p>

<p>Alternatively, Humanity, as a species, has failed. Our time has passed.</p>

<p>Perhaps cockroaches will evolve to do better?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>thats the thing tho. i feel like since they clearly were able to rig the primary and voting in favor of clinton why wouldnt they have been able to do the same for trump (maybe in less obvious ways)? how come all of a sudden our votes do matter and the power is back in our hands after TPTB have appeared to be in control for longer than who knows? could trump not have been a tool to get people to rally around and see as a symbol of anti-corruption in hopes that people believe they have &quot;won&quot; and defeated the corrupt powers that be (thus getting attention off of them-tptb)?</p>

<p>im not really directing these questions at you but just trying to show how completely confused I am about this election from a TPTB &#39;conspiracy&#39; standpoint. </p>

<p>i know its weird/doesnt really make sense why so much energy was put into clinton just to have her fail, but im just not able to accept the idea that TPTB got stupid, forgot how to operate and have lost all their power after calling the shots (in sometimes complex ways) for so long</p>

<p>in my eyes both candidates were huge pieces of shit, but the fact that it came down to them two and the fact that this election was like a show/movie and was so strange, bizarre, &amp; unlike any other and the fact that there was so much blatant rigging/corruption going on and the fact all of this just felt like a practice run or a testing the waters sort of thing (sort of like the increasingly militarized police showing up to peaceful protests) makes me think that we are headed towards some huge event or events that are gonna fuck shit up and change everything</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I brought this exact point up in a thread last night. The conclusion that was reached was largely that the TPTB could not rig the election because of various reasons, the main one being that the votes for Trump were so large that it would have been impossible to sway it without being completely obvious. The other reasons being Trump is only superficially anti establishment/anti globalisation and once in office will play ball with the globalist. The angle I am sticking to is that a Trump victory will accomplish two things for TPTB </p>

<ol>
<li>it will neutralize the growing anger at the establishment and give them cover</li>
</ol>

<p>2 it will further divide the country along race lines that has been so clearly the agenda recently. </p>

<p>as far as the huge event/s coming I sure hope that is not the case but have a strong feeling it might be</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Technically everything still I&#39;ve when the last human dies has evolved to do better. The only measure of how well you do is based on survival to have children.</p>

<p>Humans have existed for, and experts argue, but we&#39;ll assume 1 million years because this is usually the high number in the argument. For all of those years that we existed as modern humans, we did quite well. Mastered the ability to live in any environment on earth.</p>

<p>Then. 10-15k years ago, about 4 different places independently developed agriculture. A blink of an eye has passed relative to our time in existence as a species. And we could end our own species via environmental destruction, nuclear warfare....</p>

<p>I don&#39;t think intelligence in the human form is beneficial evolutionarily.  But the jury is still out on that one :)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I want to stress THIS: The FED is the primary driver of economic policy towards Wall Street. </p>

<p>It doesn&#39;t matter what Chase or Goldman figurehead is in the cabinet, because there are 100 of them in the Fed driving QE, ZIRP, and all of them are converts to Milton Friedman&#39;s monetarist dogma. As long as central banks believe they are the center of the economy, we will have insufficient growth, horrible income distribution, and asset bubbles. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Remember, Wall Street owns the Fed.  Literally and figuratively.  </p>

<p>Several of the board of governors of Fed are ex-Goldman employees, Mario Draghi is ex-Goldman.  </p>

<p>J.P Morgan, Rockefeller, Warburg, Lazard, and Rothschild didn&#39;t create the Federal Reserve to have someone regulate them.  They created it so THEY could regulate themselves and control economic policy. </p>

<p>People often get confused and think central bankers control the banks.  It&#39;s actually the opposite, banks own and control the Fed and largely tell it what to do.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>On the contrary, after getting the Republican nomination Trump flipped his campaign script on self-funding and started taking in lots of money from GOP bundlers and SuperPACs. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Donald Trump Jr. isn’t the only Trump son getting into the super PAC fundraising game. On Tuesday, Eric Trump attended a fundraiser for Great America PAC, another pro-Trump group, which was held at Trump Tower.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Furthermore, Trump has also already flipped his script on eliminating the control of &quot;political insiders&quot;:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The Trump transition team is a who’s who of influence peddlers.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Additionally, the defense industry is also celebrating:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Donald Trump’s upset victory Tuesday has brought joy to the defense industry.</p>

<p>Finally, as a knife in the back for all you AARP old-timers out there who voted to &#39;Make America Great Again&#39;:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In August, his campaign told CNNMoney that “We will not cut Medicare or Social Security benefits, but protect them both.” </p>

<p>But two of the people said to be helming the president-elect’s Social Security Administration (SSA) transition team have a record of hostility to the program.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>if that is the leeway you will provide i understand your demands, i will support your demand for term limits.  rmember that in 1776 there was no term limits, i have to look into when term limits first began.</p>

<p>&quot;Prior to independence, several colonies had already experimented with term limits. The Fundamental Orders of Connecticut of 1639, for example, prohibited the colonial governor from serving consecutive terms, setting terms at one year&#39;s length, and holding &quot;that no person be chosen Governor above once in two years.&quot;[2] Shortly after independence, the Pennsylvania Constitution of 1776 set maximum service in the Pennsylvania General Assembly at &quot;four years in seven&quot;.[3] Benjamin Franklin&#39;s influence is seen not only in that he chaired the constitutional convention which drafted the Pennsylvania constitution, but also because it included, virtually unchanged, Franklin&#39;s earlier proposals on executive rotation. Pennsylvania&#39;s plural executive was composed of twelve citizens elected for the term of three years, followed by a mandatory vacation of four years.[4]&quot;</p>

<p><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Term_limits_in_the_United_States">https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Term_limits_in_the_United_States</a></p>

<p>Based on that history i think term limits have a chance at good reform this time around as well.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah basically the film was altered to show the exit wound being in the front right side of his head. But if you look at real autopsy photographs or listen to interviews of the ones who saw his head that day they will say the back of his head was blown out. The z film was held from the public for years. The one thing they could not change though was the motion of his head. Thus the discrepancy between the fake frontal exit wound and the motion of his head being blown back by the real shot from the front and exit wound in back.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I still think a Trump presidency will be better than a Clinton one, or at least provide us with more of an opportunity to change things if we can seize it. With a Clinton presidency, the same bankers and CFR media would be running the show in the background, yet the liberal/progressive half of the country would be defending her from all attacks. Remember where the anti-war left went after Obama was elected?</p>

<p>Yet with Trump, there&#39;s at least the chance that we can start bringing some of the left, with whom there&#39;s still large disagreement from the right, over to our side of questioning the deep state. Unless even this was an act, Trump will not be so careful about not letting secrets slip. He&#39;s more likely to overplay his hand. Those on this sub and the population we represent, even those who supported Trump once their euphoria fades, will be strongly criticizing everything his administration does wrong. </p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>the liberal/progressive half of the country would be defending her from all attacks. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>No no no, let&#39;s clarify this a bit.</p>

<p>The liberal/progressives were the ones who didn&#39;t show up to the polls, or the ones who already said &quot;Fuck the DNC&quot; and voted for Trump or a third party.</p>

<p>The <em>Democrats</em> would be defending her from all attacks, that is true. Do not get the Democrats and the liberals/progressives confused, however. They are, at this point, two entirely separate entities.</p>

<p>Your typical anti-war, anti-interventionist, peace-loving, pot-smoking, gay-marriage-approving, planned-parenthood-supporting, universal-healthcare-wanting, immigration-friendly, minimum-wage-raising, tree-hugging, equality-for-all, liberal/progressive... they already question the deep state. As much as the right ever has. <em>(side-note: the anti-war left was extremely vocal regarding their opposition to entering into a war in Syria)</em></p>

<p>They know the system is rigged against us. They know that the financial and political elite needs to be ousted. This is why they showed up for Bernie Sanders. And when he got screwed out of the nomination, they didn&#39;t willfully gather behind Clinton. Those that got behind her did so begrudgingly, many looked towards third parties for an answer, and some begrudgingly (or out of pure revenge towards the DNC) settled on Trump.</p>

<p>The &quot;Establishment&quot; that has taken over the DNC are &quot;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third_Way">Third Way Democrats</a>&quot; who are snuggled up all cozy and close to the Neocons, as they share similar economic and foreign policy goals (they differ on domestic social policies, and do so to opposite extremes so that they can keep us bickering at each other instead of paying attention to the shit that they&#39;re doing behind the scenes). </p>

<p>This year&#39;s Democratic primaries have shown that these Third Way folks don&#39;t take kindly to liberals/progressives at all, just as the Neocons don&#39;t take kindly to the Tea Party and staunch conservatives. </p>

<p>This Third Way/Neocon insiders club (or the establishment, or whatever you want to call them) and their blind, loyal followers are the group that, as you accurately stated, would have protected Hillary from all attacks, and they have done so for this entire campaign cycle.</p>

<p>Liberals/progressives aren&#39;t in opposition with conservatives on this. If there&#39;s one thing we can easily agree on, it&#39;s that &quot;the establishment&quot; needs to go.</p>
</div>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re absolutely right; I did paint the left with too broad a brush (and to be fair, on many issues I identify more with the &quot;left&quot; than the &quot;right&quot;). The anti-war left didn&#39;t leave completely when Obama took office, but their ranks were cut by quite a bit. Many who had been anti-war during the Bush years were only anti-war by extension of being anti-Bush and Bush being pro-war. That&#39;s more the point I was trying to make, albeit poorly. </p>

<p>The actual liberals/progressives, some of whom I follow, were against the national security and national surveillance state even under Obama, and I need to give them credit for that. </p>

<p>There is, however, a large contingent of people who self-identify as progressive/liberal who are more concerned with identity politics and <em>relatively</em> superficial issues, that probably don&#39;t even know what the &quot;deep state&quot; refers to, or the difference between liberalism (in the modern US sense of the term) and neoliberalism. They follow the Third Way, but aren&#39;t even aware that&#39;s what they are. </p>

<p>Under a Clinton presidency, I think their defense of her would have largely cancelled out the critiques from the left, and the major dialogue would have been the Clinton brand of neoliberalism (with a few token concessions such as LGBT and women&#39;s rights) against a Republican neoconservatism with which she largely agrees on foreign policy. </p>

<p>Absolutely agreed. While I&#39;m pretty liberal on most social issues, though stopping short of some of the overly aggressive PC culture which has hurt social liberalism, I have no problem uniting with social conservatives on issues which I think matter more, namely globalism (&quot;trade&quot; deals, global governance, etc) and individual and local/state power vs. a centralization of power. If the Trump presidency can manage to unite these sometimes disparate groups, I call that a plus. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree with all of this.</p>

<p>However, I personally have a very difficult time seeing Trump being able to play the role of &quot;uniter&quot;. His rhetoric and demeanor, stretching throughout his entire life in the public eye, has been so divisive and alienating (his public Twitter battles, his attempts at exclusion of minorities in his real estate properties, his staunch opposition against Obama and the birther movement he championed for so long, and so much more I could mention without even getting into this presidential campaign). Even when his views have been justified, his approach to those conflicts has been toxic more often than not. It&#39;s as if he isn&#39;t out to find solutions or compromises when other people stand at odds with him, but rather he seems hell bent on proving himself to be right, or justified in his opinions, or somehow better than the other person, or.... maybe he just enjoys arguing with people.</p>

<p>In any case, I think it will be difficult for him to adapt to the unifying role that he now needs to play. He&#39;s never shown that side of his personality in public, so I&#39;m skeptical that it&#39;s in him to do that now.</p>

<p>(to circle back to your main point, I wouldn&#39;t have been able to see Hillary being able to unify the country if she had won, either.)</p>

<p>I&#39;m also still not thoroughly convinced that Trump isn&#39;t part of the same Third Way/Neocon establishment. His rumored potential picks that he&#39;s vetting for cabinet positions include Giuilani, Christie, Gingrich, Dimon (from JP Morgan), McCaul, Rogers, Hensarling... all people that I&#39;d consider to be part of that insiders club. I&#39;d hardly consider that &quot;draining the swamp&quot;.</p>

<p>But, with all that being said, I remain skeptical but completely open minded. I truly hope he proves everyone wrong and can become the unifying force that we so desperately need him to be.</p>

<p>We shall see.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Trump being a true uniter would be great, but I don&#39;t really see it going down that way, either. Even if he wanted to, I don&#39;t think he has enough people around him that he trusts and who also want that, and I think he would be pushed into pursuing the deep state&#39;s policies that end up hurting us all. And I think he probably is part of the neocon movement, or at least won&#39;t do much to oppose them.</p>

<p>No, my idea of Trump uniting us was more along the idea of forming coalitions against him, for those policies we can get consensus to oppose him. NSA and other domestic surveillance is one such area, and foreign interventionism could be another. Obama had enough popularity that he was given a pass by a large part of his party, but I don&#39;t know that Trump will have that same popularity with his own base for that to happen. </p>

<p>The hardest part of forming such coalitions will be agreeing to disagree with people who hold vastly different views on certain topics. At least ostensibly, Trump will be pushing more right wing social policies, including restrictions on abortions and LGBT rights. The left should oppose this if they want to, but they&#39;re going to have to be willing to work with those members of the right who support these if we are to have any chance of opposing the deep state he will likely represent. </p>

<p>The historical tactic of dividing the anti-war, anti-surveillance factions was along social lines, and so far it has worked spectacularly. I think the left will have to accept that they&#39;re probably not going to get much done on social issues for four years, but that does not mean they can&#39;t get work done on reforming the deep state if they can effectively organize alongside the right-libertarians and the like. </p>
