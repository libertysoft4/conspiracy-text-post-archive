<p>So the election happened, and everyone lost their shit. I personally was more upset that the Clinton administration was caught red-handed when they cheated their way to the nomination, and no one did anything about it. But whatever.</p>

<p>Protests are still going on across the country. Los Angeles alone has been protesting every single night since Wednesday. I was there... </p>

<p>People are angry. People are worried. Fuck, I&#39;ve seen people burst into tears, it&#39;s like they&#39;re grieving. The fucking KKK is publicly organizing (just an example) and people are being hurt and killed, even. </p>

<p>And now there&#39;s this Pizzagate bullshit! Have you guys looked at this?!? </p>

<p><a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/pizzagate/comments/5cj3oo/11122016_update_please_see_subreddit_rules/">https://np.reddit.com/r/pizzagate/comments/5cj3oo/11122016_update_please_see_subreddit_rules/</a></p>

<p>There&#39;s a significant amount of evidence that suggests our own fucking government is a part of some global, elitist, pedophilic sex trafficking cult clusterfuck. </p>

<p>...</p>

<p><strong>what</strong></p>

<p>And then I think about the Bohemian Grove, and Eyes Wide Shut and a number of other popular &quot;theories&quot;... and... I don&#39;t know, man. I feel like we are on the brink of mass exposure. I feel that now, more than EVER, we are in the best position for the truth to finally come out. NWO, shadow government, Rothschild Dynasty, Aliens from the future- WHATEVER THE FUCK. </p>

<p>I am <em>sick</em> of feeling like I don&#39;t matter, of being lied to and brainwashed over, and over, and over, and over.</p>

<p>I am <em>tired</em> of being distracted. We just sit back and do nothing when everything we need to change the world for the better is at our fingertips. </p>

<p>We need to do something. Read, write, contribute, dig deeper, we can&#39;t be afraid anymore.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yup. A family member of mine, though, tried to claim that the DNC was an independent organization and we either had to deal with it or switch parties. To her, that what Clinton did was how politics were played, and she&#39;s clearly the better player so we should vote for her.</p>

I had a close personal friend tell me that all the shit that clinton and the foundation have done is &quot;business as usual for politics&quot; and that &quot;it does not change their vote&quot;.  I was shocked, still to this day i am shocked.  I never supported Trump, but after watching Sanders at the DNC i knew that i could never vote for a Clinton.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It would be really helpful for me, if there were an accurate database that could be searchable by the common man. Any time somebody has a hunch, he could look up something.</p>

<p>For example, a restaurant would most likely have a health inspector come by. Is it possible that only a certain health inspector inspects the locations that are associated with Hillary? It&#39;s such a small connection, but if the location has secret passages, then they wouldn&#39;t want strangers snooping around.</p>

<p>Anybody involved in safety is worth examining.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Maybe one&#39;s reaction depends on how long you&#39;ve been looking into conspiracy theories and how far down the rabbit hole you&#39;ve gone. Been in CT land since 99, and this comes as no shock at all. In fact, it&#39;s exhilerating to see so many take an interest in this very, very difficult subject matter! But, if I were newer to the CT world, I can see how it would be devastating. I remember how physically ill and helpless  I felt when I read about the elite pedo ring stuff for the first time. It&#39;s nothing short of life changing.</p>

<p>Hang in there. You are certainly not alone.</p>

<p>Then 9/11 happened and it made no sense.  I kept waiting on jets to mobilize and nothing... and then of course the demo style collapses. But it took some weeks. I was in shock.  It hurt so bad.  Like how maybe it felt for Neo in the Matrix movie suddenly awake and disconnected and in an alien world that&#39;s actually his real world.</p>

<p>Then I read The Unseen Hand conspiratorial history book.  Oh... so much that never made sense suddenly did.</p>

Start with The Dutroux affair on Wikileaks. (not the nsfw site explaining it but the legal document) Here is a link to the translation:
<a href="http://www.wikileaks-forum.com/belgium/358/translation-belgium-dutroux-dossier-summary-1235-pages-2005/16315/">http://www.wikileaks-forum.com/belgium/358/translation-belgium-dutroux-dossier-summary-1235-pages-2005/16315/</a>
This is a LEGAL document that ties into Franklin and explains the situation now. There is a reason it is not translated into English, only on there in French, and reason that the Belgians are sueing wikileaks to remove the doc.
Maybe the reason European aristocracy. Maybe it&#39;s military. Maybe it&#39;s deeper. KEEP LOOKING. PLEASE.
Here is a long explanation the covers almost everything and is well researched: <a href="http://www.lifeonchildreninthemix.com/BELGIUM.html">http://www.lifeonchildreninthemix.com/BELGIUM.html</a>
It does not have NFSW images like other sites on this topic. PLEASE, KEEP RESEARCHING. THIS INFORMATION IS AVAILABLE. DO NOT GIVE UP.</p>

I grew sick of the fear porn years ago but anytime I saw what agenda was being pushed I was able to see right through it. Turn the tv of for 6 months and you will be surprised at how fake and obvious it is when you see it again. I think they may also run a subliminal subtext alongside the fear narrative and time away from the signal helps separate it and differentiate from your own thoughts. </p>

<p>They aren&#39;t just pedophiles...I&#39;m sure some are, but its more about satanic ritual murder. Also, they most definitely are eating infants.</p>

<p>Here is a police interview with a child who escaped one of these satanic churches :</p>

<p><a href="https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=Yi61QZPNzN0">https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=Yi61QZPNzN0</a></p>

<p>They are chopping the heads off these children, draining and drinking their blood and cooking and eating them.</p>

<p>I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if they were making the pizza sauce out of the blood and perhaps meat sauce.</p>

<p>Also look up the Finders if you haven&#39;t seen that already - Ritual murder and sexual abuse are not separate entities - &quot;spirit cooking&quot; was a basically sanitized version of reality.

<p>When we watch the spirit cooking videos &amp; anything in that vein we are voluntarily participating in their rituals - as far as they are concerned. Gives them spiritual energy in their mind. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s infuriating, really.  I kept my mouth shut on social media about my real opinions because I was pretty sure Clinton was going to run away with the whole thing.  But now that people actually decided they weren&#39;t going to tolerate her bullshit anymore, those who supported her (or more frequently, only supported her because of her gender OR because she was a better alternative to Trump) are fucking freaking out.  Believing everything they see in the media.  Turning a blind eye to the fact that the <em>media fucking profits off of every goddamned riot they report on</em>.  They don&#39;t make money reporting on cute kittens and puppies.  They make money off of blood, violence, instigating fear.  It started before the election and now it&#39;s just getting out of control.  </p>

<p>People I thought were fully rational before all this are completely turning their backs on any rational discussion of what&#39;s really going on out there, why people really voted for Trump and didn&#39;t support Clinton, why some facets of the country are frustrated and irritated with the status quo.  People won&#39;t listen.  &quot;Oh, you didn&#39;t vote for Clinton?  That makes you a racist/fascist/bigot/misogynist/pedophile and I&#39;m therefore going to disregard everything you say from now on.&quot;  </p>

<p>I don&#39;t know when people are going to wake up, but the more the media stokes these flames, the worse it&#39;s gonna get.  MSM instigates something, everyone posts it to FB, and everyone who uses FB for their news freaks out.  </p>

Plus the entire world is focused on ISIS. </p>

<p>But why would Russia do this? My answer is brief and simple, to reunite the Soviet Union without the rest of the world being able to do anything against them, it makes sense IMO, ever since they realized they couldn&#39;t have annexed crimea without triggering everyone from the United States to NATO and Europe.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know, maybe I&#39;ve read too much freaky shit or something but I&#39;m really scared</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I disagree. Russia absolutely despises Soros to the point of having like, an international arrest warrant on him. If anything, I would believe Russia is feeding Trump information and when he takes office in January, they&#39;re going to crack down on the Clintons and every corrupt fuck surrounding them -- or at least try to.</p>

<p>I know Hillary has had some health problems as of late, but I mean, where has she been since the election? Besides the staged hiking photo, she&#39;s been MIA. Some are going as far as to speculate she&#39;s trying to skip town because she knows she&#39;s fucked.</p>

<p>I hated Trump before this election, but seeing him change some of his policies while still seeming to be in cahoots with Putin is comfortably unnerving. You know?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes! This has been my fear since the summer when I knew a Trump presidency was eminent. I know someone was pulling the strings behind the scenes to ensure his success because the entire establishment was against him. When was the last time anything like this has ever happened? NEVER! So I started becoming suspicious about the shadowy figures that have created the situation we now find ourselves in. They&#39;ve even used other smaller conspiracies (DNC leaks, pizzagate, FBI emails) to throw us all off the trail and make us think we&#39;re close to something. It&#39;s the classic long game approach! Allow your pawns to die so that the king and queen may live. The ones facing the public are just that, the pawns. I think we&#39;ve all been distracted and duped! Everyone has become so riled up by Trump and Clinton and what they represent instead of who&#39;s pulling the strings. How did we let this happen? I&#39;m scared that we maybe at the precipice of something far darker than any of us could image.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you want the Red-Pill, then the truth is that the average human perception of reality is extremely misguided.</p>

<p>Consciousness is the driving force of the universe, and it is also one of the most powerful, if not THE most powerful element of human life.</p>

<p>You said it very well with:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>We need to do something. Read, write, contribute, dig deeper, we can&#39;t be afraid anymore.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But we also need to understand, and add - manifest. We have to envision the world changing for the better, and then we need to cultivate the faith that this will come true. The &quot;shadow governments&quot; that have so deftly guided humanity for all these years are well versed in these esoteric concepts. Their lies and brainwashing techniques were deliberate, and intelligently implemented. Unfortunately for them, as we continue to wake up and take control of our lives they will find themselves more and more outmatched.</p>

<p>You are sick of feeling like you don&#39;t matter? Good. Stop it. You DO matter. We ALL matter.</p>

<p>Never before in the history of this planet have we come this close to realizing, and meeting our true potential. Get excited. Be positive. Have compassion. Don&#39;t be afraid.</p>

<p>We will succeed. As many of us have observed it has already begun. Each push forward creates more and more momentum. It is only a matter of time.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>We need to stop letting them dictate the rules of the game.  They &#39;suggest&#39; to the masses that &quot;he who has the gold makes the rules&quot;.  And the masses accept this suggestion.</p>

<p>Let&#39;s put the value on something other than gold.  How about knowledge and truth?  At least these are lasting values that don&#39;t shift second to second depending on the whims of whoever stumbled across some shiny rocks.</p>

<p>The people hoarding the gold say &quot;Well, I&#39;m doing it to secure resources for my future generations because shirtsleeves to shirtsleeves in 3 generations&quot;. And then They wonder why their empire crumbles when it&#39;s built on farcical values like &quot;gold&quot;. Your empire is not meant to endure longer than that <em>because gold is not important</em>. And I&#39;m sure this could be proven scientifically if someone could pull themselves out of the hypnotic trance of shiny objects.</p>

<p>Just as a surface examination, has this &#39;strategy&#39; worked for <em>anyone</em> <em>anywhere</em> in the history of the world?  These people are trying to start a fire with 300 can openers (gold) and it doesn&#39;t work so they reason to themselves &quot;well, if I had only had 600 can openers (more gold) the fire would have started?&quot; What?</p>

<p>Maybe, this is what Trump represents.  Why, he hid his tax returns.  He doesn&#39;t <em>really</em> have any gold, but he convinced everyone he did.  Maybe, this <em>is</em> our big shift away from physical (gold) to mental (all you need now is just the <em>idea</em> of having gold). People may be saying they&#39;re ready to have their world defined by ideas and thoughts instead of materialism.</p>

<p>It has often been said that whomever won the 2016 election would almost certainly be a one termer, because both DJT and HRC were terrible candidates.  Perhaps the endgame is to allow Trump to be so controversial, create so much social division, and mess so many things up that a handpicked Establishment-approved Democrat candidate would be brought in to save the day and wipe the floors and windows with him in 2020.</p>

<p>Wouldn&#39;t be remotely surprised if Tim Kaine makes a solo bid and Michelle Obama turns up too.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>More than likely, the GOP elites are going to try and impeach him. Pence and Ryan are their golden boys. Trump is going to try and be way more progressive than Democrats anticipated, but the GOP knew it was brewing. </p>

<p>Hell, in the first debate he said he wouldn&#39;t support the Republican nominee <em>if it wasn&#39;t him</em>, and wouldn&#39;t rule out running 3rd party. On the left, you had the outsider Bernie who was 3rd party his whole life who then switched to Democrat. The biggest populist rallying cries were based around &quot;anti-establishment&quot; candidates, and the neoliberals totally ignored it. </p>

<p>Trump is saying his cabinet is going to propose: mental health checks/criminal background checks for right to carry; a student loan debt relief plan; a reform of Obamacare rather than a total overhaul; and is clarifying his comments on immigration, suggesting we only deport exactly the people he talked about: criminals and rapists. It&#39;s funny, he appoints all these pro-government Republicans that liberals are terrified of, then says they&#39;re going to do exactly some of the things liberals could agree on. This may ruffle some feathers with the GOP establishment, as well as the global elite who use the &quot;divide and conquer&quot; narrative to keep us distracted from the real issues. There is terror brewing at the GOP, in spite of the stock market, Russia, and the collapse of the DNC.</p>

<p>We&#39;ll see how much of Trump&#39;s cabinet actually gets approved by Congress, and what stuff actually starts getting churned out after his first year in office. The neoliberals (Hillary, the MSM, Zionists, and all her pals) refuse to admit that Jacksonian American still exists, and had to learn the hard way that insulting peoples&#39; intelligence is not going to work for their global empire. I can&#39;t tell whether Trump is anti-semite and pro-zionist, or pro-semite and anti-zionist, or what. I think he&#39;s going for the best of both worlds to appeal to a lot of people, but I don&#39;t know if the rest of the world will let him have his cake and eat it, too. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Friend, I can offer only my observations of both deciding sides of what this election became; I&#39;m calling alot of BS, obviously. It&#39;s dripping from everyone&#39;s faces right now. Suppose the conspiracy in actual operation is that many of the world&#39;s strongest nations -- sick of dealing with the third world&#39;s problems, worried to hell about national identity due to multiculturalism, immigration, liberal fairy tales, true or perceived weakness, faithlessness being opposed by religious zealotry -- want to turn the focus back on themselves, getting along for economic prosperity, mutual benefit. The already strong must keep getting stronger, otherwise we stagnate, correct? Wiping out incompatible ideologies, faiths, cultures, usually far &quot;weaker&quot; but nonetheless dangerous, (and of course non-white races) is one way to get there. In the superworld to come, fascism of states will thrive in theory, creating an international trade alliance and promise to band together in defeating alternatives whenever they again arise. This will be a beautiful world for the ones who buy into it...the rest, not so much. Bullies, in other words, ganging together. </p>

<p>I&#39;m progressively seeing Trump&#39;s victory as the American stage for this phenomena. Who knows if the Russians and Assange had major hands in this (although if anyone could cook it up and pull it off, it&#39;s probably ex-KGB), and the opposition out here splintered between a pretty light let&#39;s be honest democratic socialism and the neoliberal establishment, with disastrous results for the party. Traditional republicans gave way to the popularity contest hydra of the Tea Party, the skill and charisma of the alt-right, a billionaire who simply exudes godlike success of a very grim but pragmatic kind, the long-suffering christian right, and a nation largely composed of people sick of being told their ways of life were not nationally up to par, that they were less evolved. The media said things were just fine, but THEIR media and candidate warned of the pending end of days, and presto. </p>

<p>The DNC should be ashamed, but no one should or will go to prison. The Clinton&#39;s have been involved in some shady things, for sure, and are a dubious political dynasty. How this all turned into the great overarching ONE BIG NARRATIVE TO ENCOMPASS THEM ALL is fucking beyond me, honestly. It was either very carefully crafted and ramped up internationally and within, or is in fact the only conspiracy that has ever mattered, so, quick, let&#39;s bring in the strong and capitalist non-sickos to bring the biggest lie ever to justice.</p>

<p>All I can say is that populist right wing movements worldwide have followed Brexit like a goddamn schematic, and the pieces will continue to line up. It is pragmatism in the face of threat and stagnation, even decline. However, recall, you can never predict when a rogue state will emerge, feeling left out of something they feel they deserve, more than the lot they&#39;ve got at the moment. Then we&#39;ll just have to watch, and watch the fuck out. </p>

<p>No. This kind of stuff is cyclic. Some pet theory becomes insanely popular for a while and then nothing comes out of it until the next one. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Exactly. Exactly. Exactly. This is reality. Unfortunately. Now we have to do something about it.</p>

<p>This explains the connection between child syndicates and ritual murder. <a href="http://www.lifeonchildreninthemix.com/BELGIUM.html">http://www.lifeonchildreninthemix.com/BELGIUM.html</a></p>

<p>Also look up the Finders if you haven&#39;t seen that already - Ritual murder and sexual abuse are not separate entities - &quot;spirit cooking&quot; was a basically sanitized version of reality.

<p>When we watch the spirit cooking videos &amp; anything in that vein we are voluntarily participating in their rituals - as far as they are concerned. Gives them spiritual energy in their mind. </p>
