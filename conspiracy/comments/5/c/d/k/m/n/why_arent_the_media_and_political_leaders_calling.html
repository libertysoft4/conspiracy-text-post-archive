    <div class="md"><p>Civil unrest helps the liberals push their legislation involving gun control and the stripping of rights and freedoms and sovereignty. They want a police state. They want a nanny state. They want to control every aspect of human life. They are the puppets of the corporate and banking elite who don&#39;t ever want to see the 1700&#39;s-1900&#39;s happen again in the West. When leaders like Napolean and Hitler were able to rally the disenfranchised and tear down the economic monopolies and stop foreign influence. They want world government and permanent imperialism. They want cheap labour and they want outsourcing to be the standard even on a domestic level through multiculturalism. They want the bottom fighting with each other. Genders, races and classes.</p>

<p>Liberal governments have no policy that will help improve quality of life. They are only interested in distraction. They mask their agenda with the appearance of improving quality of life. The fascists of the future will call themselves anti-fascists.</p>

Hillary cheated and had the whole facist media behind her, illegals cheating their way into the polling booth at Obama&#39;s direction and she still lost.

    <div class="md"><p>The thing about martial law is .... it takes an awful lot of military and police to corral 350 million armed gun owners, especially when a LOT of those military and police are big time believers in not having martial law.   How can you trust your military and police to keep people corralled when you&#39;re asking them to corral their own people, to deny their own neighbors their lawful rights?  It can get kinda &quot;iffy&quot; quick.   Okay, so you want to use &quot;foreign&quot; troops.... do they really think that&#39;ll go over any better?   Tell us aliens are invading and we&#39;ll beg to have troops in our home to protect us but take away our guns to make us safer?  Probably not going to work. At all.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Simply because the Electoral College isn&#39;t ratified yet. The more political unrest the better for her. Gore had nowhere near this kind of nationwide sympathy on his side so he never had a chance to sway an electoral vote. Hillary doesn&#39;t either now but she is clinging on to the hope of it. The dnc is relentless and if they can find a way to break the system they will do it.</p>
