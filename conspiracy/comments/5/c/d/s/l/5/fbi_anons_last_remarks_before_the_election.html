    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s a hell of a read! Thanks for the link, but now with a skeptic&#39;s hat on, can you provide a single piece of irrefutable, non circumstantial proof that this FBIanon was actually from FBI and not some random 4chan troll(s) who threw enough shit on the wall to see that some stuck? I&#39;d love to dig into this, but I&#39;ve not seen any conclusive proof that this anonymous person who posted on 4chan pretending to be from the FBI is actually real.</p>

<p>So, before I get gishgalloped with &quot;proof&quot;, please keep in mind that I&#39;m asking for THE definitive proof, a smoking gun, that this FBIanon is actually from the FBI or has released credible info that he&#39;s the verified primary source for. </p>

<p>I also find the use of &quot;FBIanon&quot; for all the &quot;leaks&quot; and further discussions suspicious. If you had used &quot;Real FBI agent leaks damaging stuff etc.&quot;, your post would be removed from this sub, or at best if it gets traction before mods notice it, get a &quot;misleading claim&quot; flair, because it would have made news elsewhere.</p>

<p>If this existed he would be an official whistleblower and the people like Assange would be taking notice. It would be all over the alt media.</p>

<p>This is only ever going to be circumstantial/confirmed after the events happen and we can look back to check accuracy.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I believe in the original FBIAnon. He may have been throwing shit at a wall to see what stuck, but it was damned accurate. Things like this:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Q:  Will she be indicted?
A:  There is intense pressure for us not to do so.</p>

<p>The real point of interest is the Clinton Foundation, not the e-mail server.
She had SAP level programs on her server
Comey has been trying to stall because he does not want to face the Clinton machine,
They are attempting to distract by putting the focus on Hillary&#39;s emails and not the Foundation.
Lynch has also given to the Foundation, and has many ties
Soros is at the heart of all of this.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>These are all statements that have had information about them in the wikileaks. Everything else FBIAnon talked about was answering speculation and random questions. To which he provided some of the most level headed answers I&#39;ve seen. Also, remember the timing of this. DNC Leak hadn&#39;t happened yet. Bernie was still campaigning. Based on this info, I believe FBIAnon is real. I don&#39;t htink the person who wrote the above is FBIAnon.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Drain the swamp</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Is a far cry from</p>

<blockquote>
<p>No one is clean, not even Trump.</p>
</blockquote>

The look a word use, sentence length, interpunction etc. It is pretty effective in identifying and distinguishing  anonymous writers from what I&#39;ve heard.

<p>These are not statements I think FBIAnon would make, nor any FBI agent under any circumstance. Sounds like any other regular here. FBIanon was RELUCTANTLY supportive of Trump. That&#39;s a far step from spouting the drain the swamp rhetoric. FBIanon&#39;s grammar and punctuation were surprisingly good. Never resorted to caps. FBIAnon never came to us for info. He has the info and is providing to us. FBIAnon knew how corrupt DNC was. FBIAnon never used leading questions.</p>

<p>Sorry guys. I think this is a poser.</p>

<p>She is literally hiring people for key roles who are corrupted and evil like her self.</p>

<p>This is actually happening is my true belief. I am a very skeptical person.</p>

<p>Also, id like to add weight to your theory, because there was a tweet from somebody fairly high up in the chain of command on Hillary&#39;s side saying something like </p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;If you see any massive stories from Wikileaks in the next few days, its probably false.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There was major confusion and backlash about this tweet, because they were literally owning up to something huge that is or might be coming, they were in a state of panic.</p>

<p>Nothing massive ever dropped however, we have enough pieces of the puzzle now to form a picture, or at least of a 3 dimensional shape appearing. We just do not know its 4th dimension, which is time. WHEN will it come out, and for god sake i hope it comes out soon.</p>
