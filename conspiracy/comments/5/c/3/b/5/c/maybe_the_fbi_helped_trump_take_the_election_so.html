    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s what I&#39;ve been saying. The investigations &quot;turning up nothing&quot; twice in a row only stirred up public discontent and anger that she&#39;d get away with her blatant crime. They could have easily gotten her on the counts of classified data over unsecured lines, BUT if they botched it it would be so much more damaging and could bring in someone who could prosecute her for her more heinous crimes. If it were just classified data alone, she could have been pardoned by President Obama and still gotten the white house. How can he pardon her for crimes she has yet to be formally accused of?</p>

<p>TL;DR Not all conspiracies have bad endings</p>

<p>Edit - changed implicated to formally accused of</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not shitting on this theory but think of the slippery slopes here. </p>

<p>All of a sudden the FBI feels they can dictate the way things go in this country. This isn&#39;t what we should want, we should want a legal non-biased investigation and the truth be found. But instead we&#39;re advocating going back to the days of Hoover&#39;s FBI where the director of the FBI had black mail material on most of the country&#39;s not only wealthy elites but also our civil rights leaders, musicians and other artists, actors/actresses as well as others. You guys just want the outcome that you want and the devil be damned the consequences.</p>

<p>I remember when this sub used to rail against abuses of power just like this, invasions of privacy like what the NSA and the Patriot Act are doing to us, and we loved Snowden, who sure as hell wouldn&#39;t stand for this despite what Hillary has helped do and has said about him. WTF happened to this sub. </p>

<p>I get that Hillary has a lot of dirt that needs to be on display but we need her to be tried in the court of law, not some fucking lynch mob chanting &quot;burn the witch&quot;  you guys should be ashamed of yourself, the Salem Witch Trials were in the 1600&#39;s, I get it that some of us want to go backwards but do we need to go that far back?</p>

<p>And of course because I don&#39;t agree with you I&#39;m CTR, completely fucking cliche and everything that has been wrong with this sub since the CTR bullshit started.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>i would revise my title if i could</p>

<p>That&#39;s great and all but it&#39;s the spirit of the post not just the title, how about innocent until proven guilty? And that means guilty in the court of law, not a mob, that&#39;s the whole purpose of that tenet of law. It&#39;s like we&#39;ve forgotten what being an American is all about or something, either that or we never cared in the first place and just use conspiracies to justify our outrage and hatred.</p>
