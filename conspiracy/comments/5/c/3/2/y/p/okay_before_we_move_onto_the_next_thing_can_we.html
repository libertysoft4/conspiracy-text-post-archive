    <div class="md"><p>This shit is 100% real.  There is a code in the spam.  The spam is the same spam that was used in shitty online game spamrooms in the mid-00&#39;s.  They have hidden in plain sight, and then switched over to email because it&#39;s &quot;more secure&quot; but they didn&#39;t change their code.  They hide codephrases in the URLs of legitimate spam, the URLs go to real places and it all looks fine.  The codephrases are then SEO&#39;d to get you to yahoo chat groups where they talk in code, see below:</p>

<p>So, I need someone to look at this and tell me if I&#39;m just being crazy, or if this may be something...
It all started with this email:
<a href="https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/56322">https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/56322</a></p>

Subject: Brennan
John, Brennan is interested and thinks he can sign forms. can he proceed as proposed below?
**************Play online games for FREE at Games.com! All of your favorites, no registration required and great graphics – check it out! (<a href="http://pr.atwola.com/promoclk/100000075x1211202682x1200689022/aol?redir=">http://pr.atwola.com/promoclk/100000075x1211202682x1200689022/aol?redir=</a> <a href="http://www.games.com?ncid=emlcntusgame00000001">http://www.games.com?ncid=emlcntusgame00000001</a>)</p>

<p>Ok? That&#39;s a pretty glaringly horrible breach of protocol if they&#39;re using some sort of code. I mean, not only did the original message imply that the random link below contained important information, but podesta later confirms it by responding with Yes.</p>

<p>There are quite a few seemingly nonsensical emails in podestas inbox, usually containing links that only seem like genuine urls as long as you don&#39;t look at them too hard.</p>

<p>You can find quite a few of them by just searching for &quot;games.com&quot;.</p>

<p>I didn&#39;t have any luck trying to load &quot;<a href="http://www.games.com?ncid=emlcntusgame00000001">http://www.games.com?ncid=emlcntusgame00000001</a>&quot;. However, doing a google search for &quot;emlcntusgame00000001&quot; turned up a couple of very sketchy yahoo groups and various other websites.</p>

<p>The first one I found was this:
<a href="http://classics-l.lsv.uky.narkive.com/Q42Y0ahx/the-boy-who-read-between-the-lines">http://classics-l.lsv.uky.narkive.com/Q42Y0ahx/the-boy-who-read-between-the-lines</a>
Go ahead and read it. More nonsensical conversations that stress the importance of &quot;reading between the lines&quot;.
This next one made me a little uncomfortable:
<a href="https://beta.groups.yahoo.com/neo/groups/MKBreeders/conversations/topics/6715">https://beta.groups.yahoo.com/neo/groups/MKBreeders/conversations/topics/6715</a></p>

<p>SOMEONE NEEDS TO APPLY THIS TACTIC TO ALL THE EARLY PODESTA EMAILS!!!!! The ones that made people say shit liek &quot;damn these peopel get a lot of spam&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Searching public U.S. Department of State files, I found this: <a href="http://smallwarsjournal.com/blog/us-department-of-state-case-no-f-2014-20439-doc-no-c05760317-date-1231201">http://smallwarsjournal.com/blog/us-department-of-state-case-no-f-2014-20439-doc-no-c05760317-date-1231201</a></p>

<p>It&#39;s seemingly unrelated although it shares the same case number..? It could just have to do with the army&#39;s categorization techniques, no idea, but if that&#39;s true then they don&#39;t seem very sensible, or they&#39;re intentionally ambiguous</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I find it worth noting that the seemingly unrelated document I posted with the same case number (<a href="http://smallwarsjournal.com/blog/us-department-of-state-case-no-f-2014-20439-doc-no-c05760317-date-1231201">http://smallwarsjournal.com/blog/us-department-of-state-case-no-f-2014-20439-doc-no-c05760317-date-1231201</a>) discusses their strategy for Afghanistan. Again, could be nothing, but I do recall seeing some emails about DynCorp bringing in Afghan dancing boys for entertainment.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This struck me more as a general discussion of the fucked up things happening regarding prisoners of war and torture overseas... which were very much a point of discussion back in pre-2008 (Obama) era.
Could be something else, but it&#39;s easily explainable as internal communications over some of the fucked up things soldiers and agents were doing overseas.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, you&#39;re probably right. I think the lack of slang here actually diminishes the connection to everything else going on, but probably not something to disregard entirely. It could eventually become clearer in light of new information.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s just tough - if internet sleuths spread their net wide enough, we&#39;ll be attacking random businesses and individuals with any passing resemblance to any supposed symbol or code word possible. I get the desire to seek out signs and new &quot;dots&quot; to fit into the picture, but it can go downhill pretty quickly... </p>

<p>...and what&#39;s worse, if the Internet sleuths are wrong, legitimate businesses and ordinary people are harmed. IMO people should be a lot more careful with throwing this sort of language around, but on this sub, anyone who suggests anything like that is flagged as a shill or disinfo/cointel agent, so we&#39;ve sorta built our own perfect machine for creating these situations.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sounds like your typical dope smoking English majors.  I don&#39;t say that to discredit anything, its well known, or maybe not, that Intelligence services recruit bright young minds in liberal arts as they consider them &quot;well-rounded&quot; and &quot;very adaptive&quot;.</p>

<p>Could be the case with these folks and we are getting a peek into a circle of operators who have been in the game for decades.</p>

<p>Anderson Cooper is a fine example, although his major was officially PolySci, he came from an established liberal arts secondary school and &quot;travelled&quot; extensively before embarking on his collegiate career.  Even has an established &quot;illness&quot; that excused his abscense from the country for the duration of his training.</p>

<p>Podesta says to go ahead. By the way, Brennan&#39;s email was hacked last year and one of the forms he filled out was leaked on wikileaks: <a href="https://wikileaks.org/cia-emails/John-Brennan-Draft-SF86/page-1.html">https://wikileaks.org/cia-emails/John-Brennan-Draft-SF86/page-1.html</a></p>

<p>is an advertisement that was added to Susan Rice&#39;s email by AOL. Take a look at <a href="https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/?q=&amp;amp;mfrom=Ricesusane%40aol.com&amp;amp;mto=&amp;amp;title=&amp;amp;notitle=&amp;amp;date_from=&amp;amp;date_to=&amp;amp;nofrom=&amp;amp;noto=&amp;amp;count=50&amp;amp;sort=6#searchresult">Susan Rice&#39;s other emails</a>. They all have advertisements added to them.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>However, doing a google search for &quot;emlcntusgame00000001&quot; turned up a couple of very sketchy yahoo groups and various other websites.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I just did that search. They were all email messages from people using AOL in October of 2008 that had the same advertisement added to their emails.</p>

<p>So, you have found that one of Podesta&#39;s correspondents used AOL email and is thus linked to the millions of other people who used AOL email in 2008.</p>

<li>2) is this possibly about those trafficking or fetishing dwarf people? </li>
<li>3) on this links page there is a side list of links (some are available some aren&#39;t) they are: Conversations (available) , Photos, Files, Attachments (available) , Events, Polls, Links, Database, About (available) , More (available)</li>
<li>4) on the front page there is a link to the info page <a href="https://beta.groups.yahoo.com/neo/groups/MKBreeders/info">https://beta.groups.yahoo.com/neo/groups/MKBreeders/info</a> which reads &quot;This list is for everyone that loves Munchkin cats, both the shorthaired (MK) and longhaired (ML), pet owners and breeders alike. This is a tightly moderated list and will not tolerate any form of abuse towards it&#39;s members. This includes the forwarding of emails with the intent to do the author &quot;harm&quot;. Open partcipation by all is encouraged, there is no need for ugly words or comments about or towards other members to get a point across. No warning will be given, the person(s) being unfriendly and ugly will be moderated..if subsequent emails show more antagonistic responses or comments they will be promptly removed from the list. These kinds of responses and attacks keep others from participating in discussions. Advertising a personal business is not allowed. You may discuss anything related to the Munchkins and their future. Limited discussion will be tolerated of the new hybrid breeds being developed because they are borrowing the dwarfisim gene from the Munchkins. Cat husbandry, cat food, diseases, deformities, litter choices, and other topics cat related are welcome. Encouraged are: litter announcements, show wins/brags are a pleasure to hear about, and any problems with litters or individual cats. We need to openly discuss any problems encountered with the Munchkins so that we, as a group, can improve our precious cat&#39;s lives. There is no such thing as a stupid question except the one that is not asked. If it is discovered that a person has joined under false pretenses they will be immediately banned.&quot;</li>
<li>5) notice the misspelling of participation - &quot;partcipation&quot; par-tcip-ation - I believe I remember something from WikiLeaks or somewhere about a misspelling of participation ... a lot of websites, computers, and phones have autocorrect so it may be interesting to note this </li>
<li>6) also on info page &quot;Founded: Feb 24, 1999&quot; </li>
<li>7) ok I have been looking over it for a while - either this is boring and just about breeding short legged cats which is weird in itself .. or idk but I agree the links to weird not &#39;game&#39; sites is strange ... </li>

<p>&quot;Swimming-Pool Library is slang for the changing-room to which he and his friends would slip in the middle of the night for illicit sexual activities. Also, at Charles Nantwich&#39;s home there is a room that has served as a library and was once a Roman bath. And, Will borrows trashy homoerotic novels from one of the lifeguards at the Corinthian club. The club, then, is a swimming pool library.&quot; </p>

<p>Did you actually read the words you typed? How can can you not realize how silly they sound. Who talks about peanut butter and pickles? Who talks about milk and pepsi?

<p>Which, as far as I can determine, has <em>nothing</em> to do with pedophilia. I don&#39;t whether that dinner had do with Marina Abramovic&#39;s &quot;Spirit cooking&quot; or something else, but nobody&#39;s has accused Abramovic with having anything to do with pedophilia. So why do you bring it up?</p>

<p>It&#39;s called circumstantial evidence and it can be used in court. While not enough to convict on it&#39;s own, it&#39;s a start. It could be used for probable cause in order to obtain a search warrant to gather additional, more concrete evidence.</p>

<p>One could presumably find an expert to confirm the language in the emails is typically used by pedophiles. Then you&#39;d just need a judge to sign a warrant.</p>

<p>You can zoom in less and see it.</p>

<p>You might have to look at you screen on the right angle as LCD screens are very angle dependant, but even in the unaltered image with only 200% zoom or less it can be seen.</p>

<p>Heck, I can see it without even zooming in looking at the original image on a 15.6 inch laptop screen, it doesn&#39;t stand out as much, but if your vision isn&#39;t poor it&#39;s plain to see.</p>

My purposeful misspelling of his last name was a pun in reference to the pedophilia accusations being levied at him based on some strange coded emails uncovered by wikileaks</p>

<p>Its best to get information about correct the record directly from itself: &quot;Correct The Record is a strategic research and rapid response team designed to defend Hillary Clinton from baseless attacks&quot;.

    <div class="md"><p>Im not too clued up on the subject myself but what i could gather from reading the 4Chan thread was that the person who gained access downloaded two (i think) of the files of different sizes and when opened they both contained the same pizza menu but the size of the pizza menus didnt match the size of the files themselves, meaning there is a good posibility something else is hidden within those files. There was also a screenshot of the page before it was blocked, some of the files had VERY strange names for something you would find on a pizza website.</p>

<p>Unfortunately the site owners got wind of the access and blocked it, people on 4Chan were trying to find ways to re-gain access and ways to find out what was really in the files but hadn&#39;t had any luck since i last checked yesterday </p>

<p>“Hillary Rodham Diane Clinton is one of the high priests, a goddess of this ocult, (sic) satanic, shadow group. One must see their evil and profoundly corrupt motive to understand what I am talking about.” </p>

<p>“Though I know I invested a great deal of time and effort trying to expose the crimes of the Rockefellers, the Bush Klan (sic) the Clinton, and many others, maybe my skills were NOT matching my faith,” he wrote. </p>

I&#39;ve been cautious with my wording on how to discuss the pedo stuff with people, because even someone who is &quot;awake&quot; politically doesn&#39;t usually consider the darker side of the country&#39;s leadership.  we joked about it, but this gets pretty real.</p>

<p>Even though I always knew clintons were connected with scandal, watching the clinton murders documentary and reading on arkancides messed me up for a couple days.  I&#39;m pretty desensitized personally, I imagine most couldn&#39;t handle this, so how can we &quot;handle&quot; it for them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The problem with this is the cognitive dissonance. The Catholic church and it&#39;s ties to pedophilia are pretty concrete. Podesta is a Catholic Jesuit Homosexual.. So what, right?</p>

<p>The primetime entertainment on tv, movies, have been flooded with shows like Lucifer, Salems Lot. Vampires were popular. On the  surface they are just shows but the dark realities with which they are portrayals of are blown off as fiction.</p>

<p>You can show America the Olympics, and have themwatch it with their children. And then inject a <a href="http://usagymnastics.zenfolio.com/p201689933/h79dcd438#h7a9baf84">symbol like this</a> into their consciousness, and they wouldn&#39;t even notice or believe it was a Satanic one.</p>

<p>But just like pizza is a code. There is &#39; The Satan Code&#39; for lack of a better term. Which is throughout media. Disney has it, their Logo has 666 in it for starters. But it&#39;s entertainment for children. But it&#39;s there.</p>

<p>So we are dealing with codes in plain site. They have to communicate over their channels. They own the tv, the movies. They communicate their programs. They cover you in their news, and saturate your entertainment with their coded messages.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think he had personal drawings that showed stuff like electro torture on the mind and body. He was also pushed into showbiz from early age, he spoke out about a group of powerful people controlling everything before the pedo allegations (IIRC), some of his videos have the standard questionable symbols in them and if you&#39;re clued up on human psychology; abuse/trauma victims can fall into a state of mind where they take on the role of either protector, perpetrator and there&#39;s another state of mind one can go into. I forgot the last one but in psychology they refer a triangle to it. It&#39;s been awhile since I read into it but if I find a link, I&#39;ll make an edit. </p>

<p>Maybe Mike Jackson went protector mode and built a huge safe haven for kids, knowing what shit was being done to them? Idk.</p>

<p>But If you go deep into the rabbit hole, Hollywood and the music industry are most certainly linked with MKultra or MK sub programmes. There&#39;s just far too many coincidences when looking at different pieces of the picture. 
Disney club and Brittany Spears infamous &quot;strawberry&quot; video come to mind too. Even more so with comet pingpong, pizza place, Podesta&#39;s emails etc. coming to light. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah the concept of Neverland ranch could certainly fit the protector behaviour. Not just that but MKultra trauma creates alters/split personalities and it can take the victim into a childlike state of mind. 
We&#39;d never know so this is just pondering but perhaps Michael was in that childlike state of mind quite a fair bit? </p>

<p>My MKultra knowledge needs refreshing but yeah the duality imagery is linked with it. I&#39;m unsure as to why though? Is it something to do with conscious awareness? </p>

<p>The division of man and woman at the level we are seeing is probably resulting in a HUGE decline of educated children from non-broken homes.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>WHAT IF these pizza related things we keep finding are the government&#39;s own honeypot for capturing pedos? Seems like the FBI would be all over this &quot;pizza&quot; evidence right? But as far as we know, they are not. Or are they?</p>

<p>I was pondering it the other day, and then I saw this article today which makes it seem very plausible:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20161108/07362735989/unsealed-warrant-shows-fbi-malware-affected-innocent-tor-users-while-agency-ran-more-than-20-child-porn-sites.shtml">https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20161108/07362735989/unsealed-warrant-shows-fbi-malware-affected-innocent-tor-users-while-agency-ran-more-than-20-child-porn-sites.shtml</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>If you thought the FBI&#39;s admin efforts for two separate child porn websites (in two investigations spaced a couple of years apart) were questionable, you have to wonder about the morality (or legality) of the US government becoming one of the world&#39;s largest distributor of child pornography. Researcher Sarah Jamie Lewis notes that, according to her numbers, the FBI could have been operating close to half (if not more) of the child porn websites in existence.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But..WHAT IF the government&#39;s own CP honeypot is a cover or staging ground for their own secret child trafficking atrocities?</p>

<p>Here is a global intelligence agency called Stratfor talking about credit card landing pages for pizza:</p>

    <div class="md"><p>To those who understand, this was a huge part of the victory of this election. Though it cannot be explained to those not ready to hear it, we can&#39;t give up on this. These monsters are now panicking. There are some in law enforcement who recognize what is going on. Much respect to the redditors who helped expose this. Keep digging everyone. Don&#39;t let anyone tell you you&#39;re crazy. Keep talking about this until everyone knows.</p>

<p>This is such a fucking smart way to communicate in code.

You could go to organizations as big as International Justice Mission (IJM) and the Polaris Project or you could go for local/state organizations. The smaller organizations also have pretty close ties to their local/state law enforcement usually. These people have more resources and they&#39;re already familiar with how human trafficking works. Not to mention that IJM, Polaris Project, and I&#39;m sure some other big groups have headquarters in D.C.</p>

Also Child Protective Services- here&#39;s the link I&#39;m referring to with that topic.<a href="http://pdf.yt/d/GPCopyJd2XQjvNIk">http://pdf.yt/d/GPCopyJd2XQjvNIk</a> Author Senator Nancy Schaeffer had the typical mysterious murder-suicide occur which seems so common when people get too close to this issue or threaten to stop it. She was a senator so she actually had the potential to voice opposition to this type of syndicate if she had lived. </p>

<p>The title is &quot;The Corrupt Business of Child Protective Services.&quot; Link again:  <a href="http://pdf.yt/d/GPCopyJd2XQjvNIk">http://pdf.yt/d/GPCopyJd2XQjvNIk</a></p>

<p>I can&#39;t make the positive statement that every single volunteer organization is involved in this, but I can warn people to be skeptical of them, out of the genuine opinion that skepticism is warranted. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I see your point. And yeah I&#39;ve heard about CPS and Schaeffer before. Still, if we send all this info in a condensed/easy to read format to a bunch of organizations the ones that are legit will pick it up.

This shows a girl that is a match superficially and now just happens to have the same eye flaw (presuming it isn&#39;t an aberration).
Even without this, it was already well established that it was probably her for other reasons (the FBI guy of 4chan saying cards).

<p>but I did get somewhere with friends today when I brought up the rape lawsuit brought against trump.  the lady claimed to have been raped back in the 90s.  but i discussed that &quot;I don&#39;t think anything will come of it since it&#39;s linked with Jeffrey Epstein, an alleged sex trafficker closely tied with that one ex-president who has a long tattered history with sex assault on women...?&quot; and they can say.. &quot;oh yeah Bill Clinton has had his scandals&quot;.  So there&#39;s a point of reference.  And they can google Jeffrey Epstein, so there is a solid point of reference.</p>

<p>I suggest removing any curse words you use that aren&#39;t factual and to clean it up and make it more technical/professional. Then people will read it and not stop thinking &quot;fucking lunatic blogger&quot;. Anything we do against these corporate facists needs legitimacy from here on out. That&#39;s something we&#39;re trying real hard for with the Green Party in my area. </p>

<p>For example, I would never share this on Facebook because I know some people would refute it based on those things, where as a professional looking article sways opinions. </p>

<p>Peter Thiel, who is one of the only Silicone Vally people who gave money to trump, is the guy behind Palantir. </p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palantir_Technologies">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palantir_Technologies</a>
2013[edit]
&quot;[As of 2013] the U.S. spy agencies also employed Palantir to connect databases across departments. Before this, most of the databases used by the CIA and FBI were siloed, forcing users to search each database individually. Now everything is linked together using Palantir.&quot;
— TechCrunch in January 2015[27]
A document leaked to TechCrunch revealed that Palantir&#39;s clients as of 2013 included at least twelve groups within the US government, including the CIA, DHS, NSA, FBI, CDC, the Marine Corps, the Air Force, Special Operations Command, West Point, the Joint IED-defeat organization and Allies, the Recovery Accountability and Transparency Board and the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m pretty sure we need trump to get in before action can be taken. we are really counting on him to press charges (those of us whom voted for him) against all those who are protected in the elite class.</p>

<p>that was probably a large motivation to vote for an anti-establishment candidate (Bernie or trump -- and trump represented a little more anger, especially after they clearly tried to rig the election, which we should be proud of obfusticating) </p>

<p>for now, they are protected by the DOJ and the rest of the establishment.</p>

<p>many of us worry they will now move to pardon themselves with their connections in such a way trump cant undo it.</p>

<p>we got him into office, so this is part of holding his feet to the fire</p>

<p>So Food Network magazine is complacent in this and is somehow advertising places with pedo ties in one convenient map?  Come on man. Get a grip.</p>

<p>I am not saying that there isn&#39;t something VERY strange here with all the &quot;pizza&quot; references in the Podesta emails, but please try to stay on track here. Comet Pizza is a real pizza restaurant...so they do have real reviews. </p>

<p>linking to illegally transporting kids out of Haiti.  Then wikileaks searches involving &quot;pizza&quot; all emails clearly coded and cryptic.  It&#39;s dark disturbing at there has been amazing investigating done by our own cyber sleuths here on reddit. lots of disturbing stuff right under our noses.  tread carefully.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Pedosta is a veiled reference to John Podesta, Hillary Clinton&#39;s chairman of her campaign and Bill Clinton&#39;s former chief of staff. My purposeful misspelling of his last name was a pun in reference to the pedophilia accusations being levied at him based on some strange coded emails uncovered by wikileaks</p>

<p>Its best to get information about correct the record directly from itself: &quot;Correct The Record is a strategic research and rapid response team designed to defend Hillary Clinton from baseless attacks&quot;. Which in non-political jargon, means its her personal misinformation team that infiltrates social media sites (like reddit for example) </p>
