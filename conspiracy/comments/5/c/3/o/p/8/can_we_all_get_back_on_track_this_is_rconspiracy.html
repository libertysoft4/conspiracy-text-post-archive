<p>You can say he threatened to jail her, or you can say he called her a career criminal.

The way Trump acted was politics as usual, and if you want citations, all you need to do is reply. :)</p>

<p>I can bet many that you&#39;re pointing your finger at have done as much if not more, not everybody is a lazy and entitled whiner, and sometimes there is plenty of reason to whine, and seriously you&#39;re in r/conspiracy, open up your damn eyes the politicians <strong>are</strong> at fault. There are so many different factors at work and most of them point to the corruption, ineptitude, and greed of the political class. Why should we suddenly &quot;stop whining&quot; when the problem is still there, and we re-elected many of the worst of them this past election, like Marco Rubio for my state. Also we can&#39;t forget the issue that is gerrymandering either, which is another corruption that the political classes have used to keep things broken.</p>

<p>Actually that is politics as usual, the examples that Hillary set are a little extreme for that phrase but they all still fall well within that phrase.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>If you&#39;ve heard it from 800 people but you&#39;re the one that still has a problem with it maybe you are the person not getting it, just maybe..</p>

<blockquote>
<p>After this election, this phrase needs to die.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No using it as an excuse needs to die, I can agree on that, but that doesn&#39;t make normal every day shady political practices anymore of a conspiracy, it&#39;s only a conspiracy when there is an effort to silence, hide, or deny what may or may not be happening. </p>

<p>My main point is now I&#39;m seeing posts about Rand Paul repealing Obamacare in this sub and similar political posts, there is no conspiracy there, unless you want to go into how the Right had completely undermined our government in order to fuck over Obama&#39;s presidency, now that can be a conspiracy, and should be, but once again most of that falls into politics as usual. </p>

<p>The newcomers to this sub really need to learn the difference between actual conspiracies and everyday politics, sometimes they aren&#39;t too different but there is always a difference.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>First, It wasn&#39;t my job to help OP support his claim. Obviously you did it for them. Otherwise, considering the election was plagued with ridiculous claims, solid evidence of illegality and conspiracy...I think, the above links can be excused given the pulse of this sub. It&#39;s been mostly politics for some time now (even before the election got going). That&#39;s why places like <a href="/r/C_S_T">/r/C_S_T</a> have gotten more traffic, as well as more specific conspiracy-oriented subs.</p>

<p>Not saying I agree with it, but it&#39;s the direction the community went. Also, I&#39;d throw a lot of credit to this sub, actually. Coupled with 4chan, <a href="/r/wikileaks">/r/wikileaks</a>, <a href="/r/the_donald">/r/the_donald</a>..I firmly believe this sub helped get the email stuff out there to people on social media. Those who don&#39;t normally entertain such ideas, etc. So, there&#39;s something to be said for that. A collaborative effort took place and I think it helped keep Hillary out of power and defeat the silent media at their own game.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Do you have a preferred conspiracy list? as far as this sub is concerned most conspiracies are politically related. If you are  interested in non -political conspiracies like aliens, lizards and flat earth no one is stopping you from bringing that discussion on the board.

    <div class="md"><p>IMO there&#39;s a difference between purely political posts and posts that are political but relate to a conspiratorial subject. For example, there&#39;s a post on the front page of this sub about how &quot;Hillary doesn&#39;t have the emotional stability to give a concession speech but wanted to be the president&quot;:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/5c0p9j/clinton_doesnt_even_have_the_emotional_stability/?st=IVBRE6SM&amp;amp;sh=aa375e36">https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/5c0p9j/clinton_doesnt_even_have_the_emotional_stability/?st=IVBRE6SM&amp;amp;sh=aa375e36</a></p>

<p>I get that Hillary isn&#39;t liked around here but I don&#39;t see how that post was relevant to any discussion on a sub meant to discuss conspiracies. </p>

<p>People up and downvote content based on whether they find it relavent to the subreddit. That&#39;s enough to bring us back online.</p>

<p>I agree with you, of course... but I&#39;ve always enjoyed <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>, and it will naturally veer back to aliens, yeti and the flat earth in time. For now, I&#39;m just enjoying the sub.</p>

<p>There was never a time where I preferred another subreddit, since I joined. I&#39;ve never had a problem with the content on this page. 20-40% has always been bullshit... but the rest is GOLD.</p>

<p>I love this subreddit.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I am, I&#39;m just responding to all the off topic posts on this subreddit, it&#39;s <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>, it&#39;s for conspiracies, but alot of the posts are just solely politics. I respond to any post I see that is trying to paint trump as a racist, but this subreddit is for conspiracies not politics, if you see people trying to paint trump as a racist in this subreddit, respond, but don&#39;t just post your political opinions on a subreddit meant for conspiracies.</p>
