<p>Many Jews are pleased about the fact that Donald Trump won.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>According to the <strong><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2016/11/08/us/politics/election-exit-polls.html">New York Times exit polls</a></strong>, Jews went 71% percent for Clinton, and 24% for Trump.</p>

<p>But Jews make up only ~2% of the US population, so their <strong>votes</strong> don&#39;t mean squat. The political power they exert is in the MONEY that VERY RICH Jews,  throw into campaigns - and in that regard, <strong><a href="http://forward.com/news/breaking-news/350531/jewish-donors-shun-donald-trump-95-of-contributions-go-to-hillary-clinton/">they backed Clinton ~18 to 1</a></strong>, with 8 of Hillary&#39;s biggest donors being Jewish. And they did it because they believed that Hillary would serve THEIR interests. They were not &quot;giving&quot;, but INVESTING - and they lost.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Many of my Jewish friends had been hoping for this. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>That&#39;s nice. </p>

<p>I have despised Hillary as a dishonest, disingenuous and corrupt manipulator for years. As to Trump, when he first started to campaign I thought it was a joke, and I remained VERY skeptical until the last 2 months or so, when I finally started to have some hope.</p>

<p>To me, this election was not as much about Trump as it was a REBELLION of THE PEOPLE against the Oligarchs of Wall Street, Banking and Corporatism that has corrupted US politicians and used them as a tool to plunder the wealth of the country - destroying us. </p>

<p>The People needed a centerpiece to rally them - and Trump, being a non-politician who was HATED by Dems and Repubs, and SHUNNED by the Big Money Masters, fit the bill. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>While I agree that Zionists - Jewish and Christian - may be upset at Trump&#39;s winning, this doesn&#39;t hold for Leftist Jews.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Jews are OVERWHELMINGLY Leftist on domestic social issues, and as I showed above, the overwhelmingly voted for Hillary.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This equating of Jews and Zionists is something that Israel has encouraged, but it&#39;s a lie and it has to stop.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I agree, but if it is to stop, the impetus has to come from Jews themselves. If they are anti-Zionist, they should make it known - because the vast majority of Jews who DO raise their voices are VERY Zionist.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have to say that on second thoughts I agree with you about this. Unfortunately the Left, including the Jewish Left, fell for Clinton&#39;s lies (see edit above). </p>

<p>There is a real problem with Jews and others conflating Judaism with Zionism, it&#39;s actually an anti-semitic trope that they themselves are propagating. Those of us who are anti-Zionist or post or non Zionist definitely have our work cut out for us on this front. Netanyahu et al are cynically stirring up the pot on this and many other issues.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The Left in general fell for Clinton. Some people on the Left saw through her. However, we dislike Trump too. Clinton is a war hawk, Trump is unpredictable but there&#39;s hope that we&#39;ll now pull back from the brink of war with Russia. Trump&#39;s ties to white supremacy are appalling and something we have to combat. This is not a matter of religion, friends of mine who are Jews and friends who are non Jews agree about this.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Good points. One thing though... what white supremacism? What white supremacist ties does Trump have that you want to combat? If you&#39;re jewish I&#39;m going to accuse you of seeing white supremacism everywhere, out of a collective paranoid dislike of everything white.

    <div class="md"><p>Firstly, my politics has nothing to do with whether or not I&#39;m Jewish. Am I Jewish? I am, although many disagree...Trump has ties to David Duke and he&#39;s anti-Muslim, anti-immigrant and so on. Anti-minority. Most Jews are actually white, some are brown or black but they&#39;re in the minority. I think there was a time when Jewish people weren&#39;t considered white. No longer, other than in some diminishing circles. Is Trump&#39;s daughter white? I&#39;d say. (She&#39;s Jewish too.)  Is Bernie Sanders white? </p>

<p>One thing that might be helpful is if you would stop thinking that Jewish people are different from anyone else. People of all races and cultures have good and bad members. I don&#39;t dislike Clinton because she&#39;s Christian, I dislike her because she&#39;s a sociopath war hawk who was leading the world into WW3. There really is an issue with Zionism, and many Jews are Zionists. But so are many Christians. So there are all these layers of complexity. I think we should celebrate our different religions and cultures, and not let them separate us.</p>

<p>It&#39;s not that the Zionist machine failed to support him, it is that they were actively working to DESTROY him in any way possible - and they probably would have succeeded were it not for the SHIT STORM that Wikileaks stirred up by exposing the vile corruption of Hillary and all of her insider pals.</p>

<p>That is what fueled the anger of The People - they were fighting the corruption of the system as much as supporting Trump - possibly more.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>I would not be the least bit surprised. Still 2 months until Trump takes office, and they can stir up a whole lot of trouble in the meantime.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>People like Sheldon Adelson gave to both Trump and Clinton. Towards the end, Adelson decided to boost Trump and gave him many millions more. Adelson is a major funder of Netanyahu. Zionists like Adelson wanted to make sure that they&#39;d have influence with whoever won. EDIT: This is not a sign of a &#39;Jewish conspiracy&#39;, it&#39;s how politics in the U.S. works. </p>

<p>Don&#39;t forget that Trump&#39;s daughter converted to Judaism and she&#39;s married to an Orthodox Jew. </p>

<p>Well hello <a href="/u/DrBoomkin">/u/DrBoomkin</a>! What an honor it is that an infamous <strong><a href="https://www.richardsilverstein.com/2009/07/10/the-israel-projects-secret-hasbara-handbook-exposed/">Hasbarista</a></strong> such as yourself should grace our humble sub with a glimpse your magnificent presence!</p>

<p>Do you really believe that the uninformed sentiments of a pack of uninformed, barely literate  meat puppets - tossed into the SWAMP by their Zionist Overlords effectively contradict the PANIC expressed by all of the well-respected Jewish (and/or) Israeli authors I cited above?</p>

<p>CHUTZPAH, <a href="/u/DrBoomkin">/u/DrBoomkin</a>.</p>

<p>U HAZ IT!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Lol, I&#39;m flattered that you know who I am. I know you aren&#39;t exactly a well adjusted stable individual, but surely even you realize that there are left wing and right wing Jews, and while the left is upset, the right is happy, just like anywhere else. </p>

<p>Oh wait, what am I talking about. It&#39;s all a plot by &quot;the zionist overlords&quot;, right? The Jews are actually a hive mind and it&#39;s all a nefarious plot!</p>

<p>A good reminder why I tend not to come to this sub often. </p>

<p>Except the fact that they  - and their American Zionist operatives - did everything they could to destroy Trump.</p>

<p>Do you think he didn&#39;t notice? They&#39;re sure hoping he didn&#39;t.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>See above. Zionists have been supporting and funding Trump as well as Clinton. It&#39;s actually people like Soros who have funded Clinton (not Trump). Soros is Jewish by birth but he&#39;s not a Zionist. Reality is complex. And I&#39;ve never heard anything about Rothschild &#39;owning&#39; Trump (unless this is one more &#39;Jewish conspiracy&#39; post). All these inaccuracies are quite irritating, it may not even be worth my while engaging.</p>

If you&#39;re jewish I&#39;m going to accuse you of seeing white supremacism everywhere, out of a collective paranoid dislike of everything white.
