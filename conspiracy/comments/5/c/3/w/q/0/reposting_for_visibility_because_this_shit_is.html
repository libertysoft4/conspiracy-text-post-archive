        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>First, this one is from the internet age so there is an amazing amount of disinfo about it online. I will share only facts from legitimate sources. You decide.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>A young brother and sister come out accusing their father, and many others, of using them in a satanic sex cult.</p></li>
<li><p>They give several hours of detailed testimony to the police. They describe rape, blood sacrifices, people adorned in baby skulls, the physical characteristics of the apparent pedos&#39; private areas, and all kinds of crazy shit. [<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ke5Q719myzk">5-hour video of interviews</a>]</p></li>
<li><p>The doctor who performs their medical examination concludes that the findings are consistent with their allegations, and that they have PTSD. These documents are leaked: [<a href="https://docs.google.com/file/d/0Byzy22cCtwpdbERtNXNhQ0Y5RmM/edit">September 15 2014</a>] and [<a href="https://docs.google.com/file/d/0Byzy22cCtwpdYy0xdVZFcGxscXM/edit?pli=1">September 22 2014</a>]</p></li>
<li><p>The mother, not the accused father, is attacked by the establishment and blamed for coaching the kids. The physical abuse is also blamed on her and her boyfriend. Talk of satanic rituals is completely brushed aside. Custody of the kids is handed over to social services, members of which were included in the children&#39;s accusations. [<a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0Byzy22cCtwpdSXY4WEtkQnF4YVU/view">Court document</a>][<a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/u/1/folders/0Byzy22cCtwpdfm1pcUxfVGIwelJ0VmhHLU5SZFNqNmxnaWVyS3F3Ui1BT05ZcFgxZlFCeUE">More legal docs</a>]</p></li>
<li><p>Hampstead veteran police officer claims to be the only one to have properly investigated, and to 110% believe the mother &amp; children. [<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWD09ApsCGg">Youtube video</a>][<a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0Byzy22cCtwpda01ENVdqZU1FVnc/view">His witness statement</a>][<a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0Byzy22cCtwpdTFpfR0tpY1hZY3c/view">Another retired officer&#39;s statement</a>]</p></li>
<li><p>Last I heard, the media was smearing the mother who was on the run from the police, and the internet community was left wondering about the fate of the kids.</p></li>

    <div class="md"><p>I would like to inform you, that if you believe this, you probably only read the titles.</p>

<p>I watched the interviews.  There is one very specific liveleak of the mother and her boyfriend coaching the kids on what to say.  (which is somewhere in here -&gt; <a href="http://www.liveleak.com/browse?q=hampstead">http://www.liveleak.com/browse?q=hampstead</a>)</p>

<p>These kids, were without a doubt, being coached.  </p>

<p>When they were asked questions, they answered in unison.</p>

<p>This one, 100%, they went after the correct culprate, which makes me happy, except, people want to believe the insane story, instead of the truth.</p>

<p>I am going to attempt to find the video, inside it shows the children being coached.  Perhaps you linked it with the material.</p>

<p>The mother and stepfather raped them, then made the satanic cult story, along with accusing the father.</p>

<p>Go ahead and tell me they weren&#39;t being coached, I have one more screengrab, give me 5 minutes to find it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Because they would each tell it in their own words, as opposed to scripted behavior.</p>

<p>Let&#39;s say you and your buddy saw a murder.</p>

<p>I ask you both aloud, &quot;What happened?&quot;.</p>

<p>Will your words match?  Or do you each speak in your own words?</p>

<p>Now what if I told you what happened, then i told your buddy what happened, and I said &quot;A car came down the road, stopped, two men got out, and the tall one shot the other.&quot; </p>

<p>if someone then asked you what happened individually, would your words match, or be different?</p>

<p>Now imagine i drilled the story into your head over and over.  How long before you are repeating exactly what I told you? </p>

<p>That&#39;s a huge sign, as is all the videos of them asking children about sexual shit in public places.  That&#39;s not normal.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>There is no video of them being coached</p>

<p>Kids were raped and your main goal is to firmly, officially, and undoubtedly assure everyone on here that they were lying about the satanic cult...because they spoke in unison...you know how that looks right</p>

<p>Do you not think this shit is real? Have a read about one in the US: <a href="http://tedgunderson.info/index_htm_files/US%20Customs%20Service%20Report%20of%20Investigation%20FINDERS.pdf">http://tedgunderson.info/index_htm_files/US%20Customs%20Service%20Report%20of%20Investigation%20FINDERS.pdf</a></p>

<p>*Also that lame proof of a pic you linked is her face when the brother mentions something she didn&#39;t really want to hear. something tells me this court case was decided by reasoning similar to yours.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Every time someone uploads or links to videos with identifying imagery of those kids&#39; faces, those children have their privacy rights violated. If you want to show those videos, have the decency to at least use blurred footage. </p>

<p>Furthermore, this story is bogus. The kids were coerced into lying on camera and to police by the mother and her boyfriend as part of a custody battle. The mother&#39;s boyfriend violently abused the children, and the mother knew. And they starved the kids on a diet of pure hempseed, causing the school to contact social services because the kids were desperately hungry. </p>

<p>Aanlrfan and anon, who relentlessly promoted this story, and all their sycophants, got it horribly wrong. This is not a case of satanic pedophilia. Or baby murder. And the tanning of baby skin. Or drinking of baby blood ritualistically, as claimed. It&#39;s just a badly executed smear campaign in a custody battle that backfired.</p>

<p>And these poor kids will have that video spread all over the internet for the rest of their lives. Because assholes care more about their religious and political agenda than about those kids&#39; privacy. </p>
