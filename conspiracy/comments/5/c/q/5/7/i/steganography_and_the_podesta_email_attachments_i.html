<p>I first became interested in these since he had one email that had Antarctica pictures attached.  All of his emails are missing the sender/receiver addresses.  A few days ago, I saw the posts in this sub related to steganography.  </p>

<p><a href="http://www.garykessler.net/library/fsc_stego.html#detecting">http://www.garykessler.net/library/fsc_stego.html#detecting</a></p>

<p>Those posts related to the picture file attachments.  t struck me yesterday that more data/pictures could be hidden in other files like PowerPoint.  Here’s one of those emails from above.</p>

<p><a href="https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/23851">https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/23851</a></p>

<p>There is a PPT attachment.  I ran an older steganography detection tool (StegSpy) on it.  Results came back “Steganography found at marker position 481237 Hiderman program detected!”</p>

<p>Through elimination, I determined that there is one specific slide (Slide 2) that is causing the hit.  “Steganography found at marker position 88493 Hiderman program detected!”
I downloaded Hiderman but it doesn’t show there being embedded information.  I believe my issue may be that StegSpy is an older program.  I could be using the wrong version of Hiderman.  It could be a false hit.  </p>

<p>Anybody have this program?

    <div class="md"><p>OP here.  So I reviewed the options in the Hiderman program.  There&#39;s an option to hide the fact that Hiderman has been used.  So you need to enable option &quot;Force to unhide from any files.&quot;</p>

<p>So even though Hiderman gives &quot;The file doesn&#39;t hide any files&quot;. it&#39;s meaningless.  Perhaps StegSpy picks it up since its made to sniff this out.</p>

<p>Now I&#39;m stuck without a password.  The Hiderman trial version only allows you to use &quot;trial&quot; as password.  Of course I found a user/pass for the Hiderman program.  </p>

<p>StegSpy is showing other attachments from the Podesta emails as having been manipulated with Hiderman.  Only a few hits so far.</p>

<p>Should I post to FourChan?</p>

<p>uBy identifying the existence of a hidden message, perhaps we can identify the tools used to hide it.
uIf we identify the tool, perhaps we can use that tool to extract the original message.</p>

<p>uCommon hiding techniques
–Appended to a file
–Hidden in the unused header portion of the file near the beginning of the file contents
–An algorithm is used to disperse the hidden message throughout the file
Modification of LSB (Least Significant Bit)
Other</p>

<p>uMethods of detecting the use of Steganography
–Visual Detection (JPEG, BMP, GIF, etc.)
–Audible Detection (WAV, MPEG, etc.)
–Statistical Detection (changes in patterns of the pixels or LSB – Least Significant Bit) or Histogram Analysis
–Structural Detection - View file properties/contents
size difference
date/time difference
contents – modifications
checksum</p>

<p>uCategories
–Anomaly
Histogram analysis
Change in file properties
Statistical Attack
Visually
Audible
–Signature
A pattern consistent with the program used</p>

<p>By comparing histograms, we can see this histogram has a very noticeable repetitive trend.</p>

<p>uIf you have a copy of the original (virgin) file, it can be compared to the modified suspect/carrier file
uMany tools can be used for viewing and comparing the contents of a hidden file.
uEverything from Notepad to a Hex Editor can be used to identify inconsistences and patterns
uReviewing multiple files may identify a signature pattern related to the Steganography program</p>

<p>uHelpful analysis programs
–WinHex – <a href="http://www.winhex.com">www.winhex.com</a>
Allows conversions between ASCII and Hex
Allows comparison of files
Save comparison as a report
Search differences or equal bytes
Contains file marker capabilities
Allows string searches – both ASCII and Hex
Many, many other features</p>

<p>uAfter hiding a message with Hiderman, we can review the file with our favorite Hex Tool.
uViewing the Header information (beginning of the file) we see that it’s a Bitmap as indicated by the “BM” file signature</p>

<p>uWe then view the end of the file, comparing the virgin file to the carrier file
uNote the data appended to the file (on the next slide)</p>

<p>uIn addition, note the last three characters “CDN” which is 43 44 4E in HEX</p>

<p>uHiding different messages in different files with different passwords, we see that the same three characters (“CDN”) are appended to the end of the file.
uSignature found.</p>

<p>StegSpy V2.0
–Signature identification program
–Searches for stego signatures and determines the program used to hide the message
–Identifies 13 different steganography programs
–Identifies location of hidden message</p>

<p>uKnowing the steganography program used to hide the message can be extremely handy when attempting to reveal the actual hidden message
uIdentifying and cracking the algorithm
–Unfortunately, some of these programs use strong encryption 128-bit or stronger – GOOD LUCK!
uReveal or Crack the password, seed, or secret key
–Practically all Steganography programs use a password to hide the message</p>

<p>uIdentify program used to hide message
uIdentify the location of the program signature in the file
uIdentify the location of the password in the file
uIdentify location of the hidden message in the file
uIdentify the algorithm used to encrypt the hidden message</p>

<p>Password Guessing/Dictionary Attacks
uA few password guessing programs have been created.
uStegbreak by Niels Provos, <a href="http://www.outguess.org">www.outguess.org</a>
–J-Steg
uCan now be found on the Knoppix Penguin Sleuth forensics CD
–www.linux-forensics.com</p>

<p>uCommon encryption algorithms used in steganography programs
–XOR
–DES
–3DES
–IDEA
–AES</p>

<p>uDetermining the password used with Camouflage
uThe location of the password was determined by using MultiHex which allows searches for Hex strings</p>

<p>uThe string was found to be “76 F0 09 56”
uThe password is known to be “test” which is “74 65 73 74” in Hex</p>

<p>uAlternate Data Streams
–(NTFS) New Technology File System allows for Alternate Data Streams
–One file can be a link to multiple Alternate Data Streams of files of any size.
–Important Note! – These Alternate Data Streams are Hidden!
–Allows for hiding of files and even directories!
–Difficult to detect
Doesn’t show up when you run c:\dir</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t have a mac.  Thank you.  There&#39;s a turd somewhere in these attachments.  FYI When I pull out the picture into a separate file, neither the PPT slide minus the pic or the pic in a separate file causes a hit.  I only get the hit when I run that slide thru intact with the pic as a ppt file.</p>

<p>So you save an image file from the PowerPoint file as like a JPEG image, and then rename the JPEG image to have a PowerPoint file extension, am I understanding you correctly?</p>

<p>I have a powerpoint file, presention.ppt. I open presentation.ppt and extract the image from slide two, calling it supercar.jpg, and save that image to my Desktop. Then I rename the image file supercar.jpg to supercar.ppt and run it through the steg detector.</p>

<p>Does that replicate your experiment?</p>

<p>I find little snippets of a different character set inside every once in a while... I don&#39;t know a lot about this stuff... but it looks suspicious especially since it has ties to Syria. </p>

<p>Also found some chinese text in unicode inside the DOC files that won&#39;t open in word. </p>

<p>Stegonography works by making slight changes to each pixel&#39;s bits in an image. It seems unlikely someone would make a tool for such a specific file format, especially one that is not mutable like an image.</p>
