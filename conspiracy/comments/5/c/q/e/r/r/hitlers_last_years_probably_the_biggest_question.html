        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Evidence surfaced of a tunnel from the Fuhrers bunker to the subway, and from the subway to Tempelhof [airport]. We also have eye witness reports of a party of unmarked planes leaving that airport on the 21st of April 1945, one day after Hitler was last seen in public.</p>

<p>We actually have more evidence that attests to his escape than we do of his death, yet people blindly believe that he killed himself in the bunker, even though non of the witnesses saw Hitlers face, or were able to identify the body. The only confirmation was that there WAS a body but the only forensic human remains from the scene was a charred skull with a bullet hole, which we subsequently found via DNA testing in 2009, wasn&#39;t even a MALE skull. </p>

<p>So if the witness testimonies in and around the bunker that day were that only one shot was fired, so if the female skull had a bullet hole in it, at the very least Hitler didn&#39;t SHOOT himself, which questions the credibility of all of the witness testimonies.</p>

<p>I could go into detail about where Hitler went from getting inside a potential plane that day but I wont in this post even though there is mountains of evidence that suggests he did escape to Argentina along with many other Nazi officials, of which we have definitive proof of [such as Josef Mengele].</p>

<p>We have enough declassified FBI documents which state active attempts to search for Hitler years after his supposed death mostly in south America. That in itself is enough to believe Hitler did not die in the bunker that die. The documents aren&#39;t from random eye witnesses claiming to have seen Hitler, they are FBI/CIA officials, on missions to hunt Hitler down. Why would they spend resources to hunt down a dead man?</p>

<p>So my question is why don&#39;t people take it seriously enough? I find it&#39;s one of THE most plausible &quot;conspiracies&quot; around, yet the majority of people are just itching to cynically shut anything down, however credible it is, in favour of the story that Adolf Hitler killed himself in his Berlin Bunker. [Presumably because they can&#39;t stand the injustice of it, regardless of what is the truth or not].</p>

Basically to see how far they could go with it, then analyse and advance the results minus any mistakes. They&#39;ve certainly used every bit of that information in shaping foreign policy, establishing hegemony, and not to mention advances in control and manipulation of people&#39;s psyches.</p>

<p>They also incorporated this data to the development of atomic energy, genetics, intelligence, military weaponry and rocketry. There&#39;d be no NASA nor CIA without the infusion of key Paperclip Nazis like Wehner von Braun and Reinhard Gehlen.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re kidding right?  Do you have any idea <em>how many</em> Nazis escaped the clutches of both Mossad and the USA and Interpol?  THOUSANDS OF THOUSANDS.</p>

<p>It&#39;s not like Mossad or the CIA are some kind of monolithic perfect organizations, you know.  They&#39;re as incompetent as any gov&#39;t org is.</p>

<p>If you read Ratline by Levenda or any of the books describing how the Nazis escaped and who helped, you wouldn&#39;t be asking this ridiculous question.  When there are whole <em>gov&#39;ts</em> helping a group disappear, it&#39;s easy to do so.  All it takes is a passport and perhaps some plastic surgery.  A number of plastic surgery clinics were uncovered in &#39;Ratline&#39; and other books.</p>

<p>People try to use the same crazy argument for &#39;aliens&#39;.  It&#39;s very easy to keep secrets, if you have political power and money.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s hard to discuss this topic because people get so irrational. Germans were anal about record keeping and there are very little records that point to a mass extermination program. Then you review the &#39;gas chambers&#39; and find de-lousing facilities and nothing more which was standard procedure in many countries around the world. Combined with the massive prisoner work program Germany used and the evidence against mass extermination is very compelling. Of course a forced labor program that didn&#39;t really want prisoners to live very long is much the same as mass extermination, but historical accuracy is important. Many countries have used prisoner labor camps and still do even today. Stalin&#39;s Russia being one of the absolute worst examples even dwarfing the Nazis program.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I did watch Hunting Hitler yes, and aside from the [at times cringeworthy] dramatization it&#39;s definitely worth pointing out that the leads they investigate and the evidence they provide stacks up as true, which obviously leads one to believe that all things considered, we have more evidence which suggests he survived and therefore THAT should be the default opinion.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>First, thanks for posting something around here other than US politics.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve torn through books and everything that Netflix/(the old) History channel had to offer. I think he died shortly after the Russians surrounded Berlin. What happened to Mussolini&#39;s body prompted Hitler to take steps to avoid that. Like it or not, Hitler did love his country. In many ways, he really did think that he was righting a bunch of wrongs. Allowing his corpse to be abused and paraded around was not going to happen in his mind. </p>

<p>While Argentina was sympathetic towards the Nazi party and had a significant German community before/after the war, I simply don&#39;t think Hitler would&#39;ve endured a very long journey on a sub, much less sneak through a maze of tunnels to an airport (with Russians about) just to get on a plane with a female pilot and narrowly escape his hunters.</p>

<p>He died in Berlin under no fan fare and his body will never be found. As he intended it. I see no possible way that the most notorious, most wanted man..perhaps in all modern history, could&#39;ve remained hidden.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Paranoid as he was, Stalin swore Hitler escaped. I believe it. As you said, there is a lot of evidence suggesting that the US didn&#39;t accept the suicide answer. U-boats surfaced well after VE Day </p>

<p>One reason it is so subverted is due to it occurring in an era of disinformation. For those of us born in this era, we were cultured to believe it for years and Hitler is a unique villain so we are more willing to accept i because of how his history is politicized.</p>

<p>More importantly, Hitler, like Stalin was enabled by US banking interests that would go down with his ship and may have even facilitated his escape, incentivizing them to protest their interests hand in hand with his.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Don&#39;t agree with the OP&#39;s characterization of Hitler&#39;s last days in Berlin. There are direct witnesses that heard the gun shot that allegedly killed Hitler. Misch claims to have seen his dead body being rolled up and carried out here, <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/8234018.stm">http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/8234018.stm</a></p>

<p>Of course there are lots of reasons to believe this is a complete fabrication. Those remaining with Hitler in the last days were absolutely devout and would lie until their deathbed to protect him. There was no body identified ever and the Russians knew what they had wasn&#39;t Hitler, thus Stalin&#39;s immediate claims Hitler got away. The Nazis has a great escape route and thousands did use it successfully to escape.</p>

<p>I believe Hitler escaped and the Allies kept it hush hush so people wouldn&#39;t pressure their governments to track him down. He planned a fourth Reich for awhile but it wasn&#39;t possible and his support dwindled quickly. Died in S. America.</p>

<p>Back in the 90s, when the Soviet archives were fully accessible to Western researchers, he looked at the Soviet records.</p>

<p>As you may recall, it was the Soviet Red Army that conquered Berlin. American troops were far away at the time.</p>

<p>According to Soviet records, the Soviets found Hitler&#39;s body, and buried his skull under Red Square. Over the years, countless Soviet army troops marched and tanks rolled over his skull.</p>

<p>Let me put it to you this way. Nobody in Russia thinks Hitler survived the war.</p>

<p>It was always described to me as &quot;They found him dead in his bunker,&quot; but apparently there was no proof of his death, and they even explored some theories about where he went.  Made me really question what may have happened.</p>

<p>It&#39;s late here and I&#39;m on mobile, I&#39;ll look for the one I tried to post to TIL tomorrow.  It wouldn&#39;t let me, since apparently someone had linked the FBI file before.  Had to submit an article that linked to it, and it only got like 10 upvotes.</p>
