<p>I just was wondering, what&#39;s everyone&#39;s theory on if and when we will have one world government that the bilderburg group wants so badly. </p>

<p>I feel as though it&#39;s a matter of time before he elites get what they&#39;ve been working for, but do you guys think that this child sex ring, spirit cooking, occult things could affect this? Like make it harder for them. Or do you think eventually our (USA) &quot;media&quot; will talk about it openly and see it as the threat it really is.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>For the most part I try and remain positive about our whole <em>being under control</em> bit, as I know it can&#39;t possibly last much longer especially after the media shit show over the past year. People are bound to be waking up left and right at this point. TPTB are getting sloppy and it shows.</p>

<p>They are seeing their vision dismantle, piece by piece.</p>

<p>Which tells me, they will continue to fight it as long as they can before the shit completely hits the fan for them and they do one last ditch effort to remain in power.</p>

<p>Which would be...some sort of catastrophic attack on the people or a very important assassination.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>When will you guys finally understand?  There are no laws in place because the constitution has been superseded.  Only ppl who consent to the court system and participate in it thereby consenting to its legitimacy receive adjudication.  Otherwise you can tell the judge he/she cannot determine the courts jurisdiction because even congress is barred from knowing about COG.  The only law in play is maritime admiralty law and law not defined by constitution.</p>

<p>You see they might come back with &quot;secret law&quot; but secret law makes the intelligence community privatized, which means their mass surveillance, warrantless survelliance and state hacking on US citizens then becomes an act of war by a hostile foreign entity.  Which means if congress continued to fund them (they did), they were doing business with the enemy which is a treason offense, making the US in breach of public contract---and therefore dissolved as a nation.  Now that cannot he the case, thus the intelligence community is still &quot;public sector&quot; therefore the only way their illegal actions are not brought to justice is that there are no laws.  The annual  COG renewal thus means the constitution is null</p>

<p>And has been since 911.  We&#39;ve been taken over and subjugated by a lawless coup, and no one in our public gov has challenged it, and they should have because they would discover what I&#39;m saying is true, and if its not, then its because of some hidden executive order we dfont know...and we  need to challenge Obama directly on his abuse if executive privilege and impeach him</p>

<p>But the silver lining is that if its tge case im right (good chances according to a const. Lawyer) the government has lost sovereign immunity because of this, since its defined by the constitution,  which means we can class action lawsuit the government into bankrupcy and sforce the to sell off ALL THEIR SHIT in another court, international court for example.  We should act quickly</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I feel like we already are a one world government. Democracy is a concept that&#39;s been sabotaged by globalists to keep the NWO under disguise. All countries with a democratic form of government are already part of the one world government. A child sex ring being exposed wouldn&#39;t do anything to stop it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>As far as I can tell they are on track, I think all the scandals are deliberate. </p>

<p>It looks to me that TPTB are renovating their puppet set; Furthermore, I remember reading during my studies on the Saturnalia Death cult that TPTB always gets their puppets hooked on something like pedophilia, death rituals, etc.</p>

<p>Knowing that, I am of the opinion that they are in the process of delegitimizing the current government puppets around the world so that they can provide us with a solution to that problem.</p>

<p>As for what I think of the death cult, Apart from their practices it brings an interesting perspective when you read the mythologies of ancient peoples. </p>

<p>They become more like history written in metaphor instead of made up stories to explain a world they don&#39;t understand.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well it&#39;s all spelled out in the agenda 2030 UN documents. It describes a drastically different world with a equalizing of countries and redistribution of resources. It calls for various utopian ideas only attainable by all countries submitting to a central global power. The only way any of that plan is possible would be after something like ww3 and the plan would be used when rebuilding after total destruction of the old order. <a href="https://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/post2015/transformingourworld">https://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/post2015/transformingourworld</a></p>
