    <div class="md"><p>Two big things leap out at me First off, while I agree our agriculture needs some cleaning up if we go back entirely to organic we are not going to have any where near the yields we have now. Food prices will climb. Second is both mentions of recycling everything. While we do need more recycling with specific things in the US the problem is recycling is more energy intensive in many cases. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think the main problem with the ideological extremes of every party, which I agree with you on, is that the people voting for their candidates have the expectations and/or the misunderstanding that these ideologies should be accomplished and achieved in 4-8 years. </p>

<p>Either because of such expectations, or perhaps it&#39;s partially the cause of such expectations, our political candidates&#39; rhetoric leans heavily towards promising they can accomplish these goals during their time in office. Ultimately, this is why we&#39;re all left so disappointed every 4-8 years.</p>

<p>That&#39;s not what party platforms are for. They are not 4-8 year agendas to be accomplished if their candidate gets into office. They are long-term, multi-generational goals to work towards.</p>

<p>So no, we will not be able to go back to purely organic farming within the next 4-8 years. That doesn&#39;t mean it would be asinine to take strides to see what new technologies and/or methodologies we might be able to create to get us closer to that goal.</p>

<p>And yes, recycling is more energy intensive in many cases, but how do we get to a point where it&#39;s not? We start focusing on it now, and make whatever steps we can, whenever and wherever we can, in order to get us there. </p>

<p>So, in terms of a quick-fix, immediate results, automatic solutions kind of thing... yeah, sure, the Green Party&#39;s platform may seem a bit out of reach. But in that whole &quot;planting trees whose shade we know we shall never sit in&quot; sort of way... their platform isn&#39;t outlandish at all. It&#39;s just laying out the direction they&#39;d like to work towards. </p>

<p>Also, to get back to Jill Stein in particular, it&#39;s worth noting that none of these points were part of her campaign pledges.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was full-on expecting that Johnson would get at least 9% of the vote. For fuck&#39;s sake, he had been polling at 22% in New Mexico and been tied for second in the border states for a month prior to 11/8. I was calling bullshit on it to my Libertarian buddy and he wasn&#39;t surprised a bit; he said a lot of people were really upset and didn&#39;t vote. Apparently the week before the election Bill Weld decided it would be appropriate to endorse Hillary. Talk about campaign suicide... &quot;We&#39;re not gonna win anyway, go vote for Clinton!&quot; I hadn&#39;t heard about it, myself, but I had seen several months ago where Weld said he looked up to Merkel... They couldn&#39;t have been too serious about their campaign.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, to a degree it&#39;s controlled. You can only fudge the numbers so much, right? I had no problem believing that he was polling that high in New Mexico - he is very liked there, where he served two terms as governor. But I don&#39;t know, your explanation certainly plays into it too- many people did inevitably think it better to vote for Clinton or Trump when it came voting time. I&#39;m positive that Johnson&#39;s numbers dwindled because of Weld, though. I&#39;m not a member of any of the groups he&#39;s in but all the Libertarian-minded people he had on Facebook were blowing up these groups because of how pissed off they were that Weld endorsed Clinton. Johnson lost a very significant amount of his supporters from that.</p>

<p>Also, FYI, democrats often have slight overrepresentation in polling for a reason. Which is that there are slightly more people who identify as democrats than republicans. Equal representation of parties in polling would not be representative of the country. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The problem, in my opinion, with polling during this election year is the faith in the term &quot;likely voters&quot;, when we have deeply hated candidates, unexciting candidates, and candidates primarily backed by the least likely demographics to show up to vote. </p>

<p>Since 2014, there are only 3 samples out of about 40 that put republicans ahead, and only 7 in the &quot;leaners&quot; group. Altogether, democrats are ahead by at least a few points. You can&#39;t look at a couple outliers and call it even. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Also, to touch on that D+10 instance you&#39;re talking about, that&#39;s just going to happen sometimes, particularly when democrats have a larger percentage in the country. But that&#39;s why we primarily rely on aggregate polling (I don&#39;t like when the media freaks out about single polls toward either side). </p>

<p>Some of these polls, like this one, are not made to have participants screened and create accurately representative samples of party demographics. It&#39;s just random polling, with sample size justifying its accuracy. That can swing many different ways. It&#39;s hardly evidence of manipulation, and even if they wanted to do that, they could have falsified data to show Hillary polling higher with independents and republicans. You can disagree with their methodology, but they&#39;re showing you what it is. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The nonresponse rate accounts for the inaccuracies of polls as of late.  While they&#39;re still selecting a sample of, say, 1000 people, today they have to go through twenty times that to find people who actually are willing to answer.  And what are people who answer likely to be?  People with strong political ideologies.  Most Trump voters were in the middle but ended up swaying towards him.  So it makes sense that Hillary supporters would be overrepresented in the polls- because they actually answered them.</p>

<p>Yes, but many people unenthusiastically voted for her.  I know very few people who voted for Trump, but I&#39;m not ignorant enough to assume that my professional and social circles represent the country as a whole.  In fact, I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve ever met someone from the dakotas. </p>

<p>That said- if there was any significant malfeasance at the polls (and at my polling station it would have been easy to vote several times- the books were out, the booths were open and nobody was really checking anything), I would suspect it was by the dems in the swing states.  I feel like the republican apparatus didn&#39;t have enough of a dog in this fight, this time around.</p>

But hey, your right, some places are incredibly expensive so let&#39;s just disregard the landowner thing and compromise on who should be able to  vote, right? Firstly, judging by the IQ gap between whites and other races, the pedophilia and other crime issues with LGBT&#39;s, and the conformity of women, I&#39;d be happy if only straight white men were allowed to vote. That&#39;s how we got Andrew Jackson and all the other great presidents. (AND also how we got the next great, Trump. Lolll)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No. The Electoral College is divided fairly by population. Less rural voters means more weight should be attached to the vote. Urban voters have more of a collective voice and a huge amount of Electors. I could say the same about places like California in LA/SA and New York. In states with mega-cities, rural voters have to abide by the overwhelmingly liberal state legislatures. That is a vote being unfair. Not the average liberal pseudo intellectual in cities who consistently vote Democrat time &amp; time again for presidential elections. Well, California since 1965.</p>

<p>I have no problem believing that 70 million people support Clinton, its still a minority of the country but it creates this illusion that she won the popular vote. She had a slightly higher percentage of the 40% of the population that actually voted. Hell more people in the US don&#39;t have the right to vote (non-citizens, underage, ex-cons) than voted for Clinton. </p>

<p>Likewise third party supporters were less likely to go out and vote since they knew their vote wouldn&#39;t change the overall election results. </p>

<p>Also of note, a lot of people can vote democrat without being pro-Clinton. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>there is a 0% chance HRC won the popular vote. If Donald Trump had lost do you know all people would be doing is showing example after example of election fraud on Nov 8th. I live in Philly and there was so many reports it was insane. </p>

<p>In Florida they got caught filling out the ballots in the back. That is literally just one person we happens to catch. Think about the couple hundred thousand we didn&#39;t catch.</p>

<p>They tried but the rigging just wasn&#39;t enough. They were not expecting Trump to win by a landslide.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The Democrats would not let Republicans poll watchers into the building who were legally supposed to be? How do you know how small scale that is? In Florida they were in the backroom filling out ballots. Those are just the people who got caught.</p>

<p>With all due respect, you have given ZERO examples of anything related to election fraud. Are you saying the Republicans put fake votes in to the system? Yeah because it didn&#39;t appear that Trump had any momentum at all in his last week. Let&#39;s also ignore the Reuters poll that had him up by 6% the morning of the election.</p>

<p>I provide examples and you say it is small scale. While you provide no examples and call it large scale.</p>
