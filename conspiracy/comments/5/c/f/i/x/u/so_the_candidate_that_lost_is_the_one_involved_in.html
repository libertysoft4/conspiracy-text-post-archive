<p>The candidate who didn&#39;t win lost, in part, <strong>because</strong> they were involved in conspiracies and all kids if BS, you mouth breathing, knuckle dragging, spoon fed retard.</p>

<p>Instead of throwing around insults and your own delirious interpretation of the facts why don&#39;t you spend 10 minutes on research and investigating the actual facts instead of what your professors or coworkers or newspapers or television feeds your neuron malfunctioning brain??</p>

<p>Spend 10 minutes in this sub or r/Wikileaks looking at ACTUAL internal communications from Hillary, the DNC, or John Podesta. Look at the corruption and collusion and illegal activities perpetuated by your own martyr.</p>

<p>If you don&#39;t trust the Russian state controlled leaks, then go to the FBI document vault and investigate government released documents.</p>

<p>Still not good enough? Then maybe research back pre-2008 and see what news stories come up regarding your candidate.</p>

<p>All of this information was available <strong>before</strong> the election and fucking retards like you couldn&#39;t be bothered to look anywhere past what was handed to you.</p>

<p>Thank god there was enough informed democrats and republicans that saw your candidate for what she was and voted elsewhere. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, without factoring in possible implications of the sarcasm, I&#39;d say that it&#39;s factual.</p>

<p>Your post is rife with ad hominem insults, and worse, spelling and grammatical errors.  Plus, it looks like you&#39;re accusing OP of being a Hillary supporter, when nothing he says indicates that.  This leads me to believe that you&#39;re a sad, unintelligent man, who is extremely insecure in his beliefs.</p>

<p>We don&#39;t need people like that posting on <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>, go back to t_d if you&#39;re going to spout partisan bullshit like this.  You&#39;re contributing nothing that suits the purpose of the sub.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You caught me. My miserable life has led me to r/conspiracy and where I can spend my time debating with people like you.</p>

<p>Let me clear the record for you;
OP implies the real conspiracy is with faulty polling data (true) and that there is a hand working against democracy (also true). Furthermore they implied that there was an unjustified thrust of anti-Clinton propaganda, in turn implying Clinton was somehow the representative of democracy and liberty. Finally OP called me, and you and the entire sub pathetic. The overall message conveyed was Clinton was wronged and by supporting the truth of her actions we are somehow partisanly supporting Trump.</p>

<p>You also have accused my post of partisan support of Trump, and I would like you to cite specifically where I showed that in what I wrote. Please do, because not a single line I wrote shows Trump support. It&#39;s you and OP that brought partisanship to the table.</p>

<p>I&#39;m sorry my typos and grammatical errors are not up to your own fine construction of the English language.  </p>

<p>Finally eat a dick. I&#39;m pretty sure you aren&#39;t r/conspiracy&#39;s police man and grammar nazi, so I&#39;ll continue to post, hopefully more now that I know it pisses you off.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I see where you went wrong.  Your jump in logic begins at &quot;the overall message conveyed was-&quot;.  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>there&#39;s clearly a hidden hand at work AGAINST democracy and liberal ideas.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If OP is talking about the establishment being opposed to liberal ideas, he probably isn&#39;t talking about Clinton.  She wasn&#39;t much more liberal than Trump, and fought against adopting a liberal platform, or at least to the extent her party wanted.</p>

<p>The attacks against democracy, I agree with too.  This election was entirely based on personal attacks, I can remember about 5 minutes total of policy discussion from the presidential debates.  Not exactly ideal in a functioning</p>

<p>Furthermore, I agree with OP&#39;s judgment of this sub.  It has become so inundated with one-sided attacks, that it reads more like an op-ed blog than a discussion of conspiracies.  Just because your candidate talks about the viability of conspiracy theories constantly doesn&#39;t automatically make him a true believer, either.  We constantly discuss Alex Jones, Snowden, and Assange working for the people they claim to speak out against.  It&#39;s part of staying on your toes.</p>

<p>Continue to post if you want, I&#39;m just telling you what was praised here before the influx of braindead t_d shitposters.  Right now, you&#39;re revealing yourself to be just as willfully ignorant and entrenched in your beliefs.  </p>

<p>There&#39;s all kinds of psychotic anti-Clinton rhetoric here.  The thing is, you don&#39;t see it, because you&#39;re used to articles like &quot;10 reasons Clinton is literally a pedophile demon&quot; from the_donald.</p>

<p>Why didn&#39;t every racist white person vote for Hillary so that their establishment could continue?</p>

<p>Why would a white racist, be against the ultimate form of white supremacy while at the same time here in a forum like <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> helping expose all of their own elite&#39;s details and evil deeds?</p>

<p>How did Hillary, who is the epitome of the white establishment (although much more liberal in our time) lose to someone who demonized Latinos, Muslims and Blacks (The Other Half of America) but literally has no backing nor political experience?</p>

<p>when trump and brexit arguments were made their use of the term globalist was correct.</p>

<p>the pressure on soros and his army is from history, i am not trying to win becaus history says we already won and will continue to win, i am simply explaining how victory for liberty will occur over the next 11 years.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sounds like you need to sit down and accept the fact that the democratic candidate was so dishonest, so corrupted, and so disliked that she failed to inspire people to show up to the polls, not to mention the unknown number of people she turned away and to Trump or 3rd parties. The DNC spent the entire election cycle just looking at how many people registered as democrats and just assumed their entire support, when in reality, she critically lacked the enthusiasm to get voters out to the polls. </p>

<p>And the &quot;hidden hand&quot; you speak of?  Sounds like the DNC to me, actively colluding against Sanders and conspiring with Hillary, all while they were planning to court conservative votes, even if it lost liberal votes.</p>

The bag lady and her pederest slaves couldn&#39;t steal enough votes or get enough illegals to cheat their way into the polling booth. Get over yourselves losers.</p>
