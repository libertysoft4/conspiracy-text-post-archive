        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>So I recently found out they&#39;ve been inducing lot of needle/cramp feelings remotely between my sleep and awake state (and synthetic headaches, very painful feelings while I meditate) so I don&#39;t astral travel or OBE. I did the stupid thing of posting my experiences online and this is the consequence, so all I can do is let you know there&#39;s something fascinating to spiritual practices and an advanced AI (probably) controls lot of things now even many people to a degree. </p>

<p>edit: must realize I took meditation very seriously and I was floating and seeing other worlds or times after much effort. Just wanted to let you know weird shit really does happen after a while.</p>

<p>edit2: Not only so I can&#39;t astral travel or OBE, I can&#39;t find the link but natural telepathy is real and can affect others with our emotions also I&#39;m gangstalked and harassed with electronic weapons in iran so when I say fuck the nwo I&#39;m not being metaphorical .</p>

<p>edit: they also induce pain when I&#39;m studying or pain/itches while I&#39;m drawing. I can tell the cramps/headaches/itches are fake because for example a bad headache will come and go for 3 seconds and do that again a few seconds after, it escalates when I do certain things, you have no idea how advanced TPTB&#39;s technology is</p>

    <div class="md"><p>yes I know all about the claims, but the thing is you are not important enough to waste time with annoying you. The other, bigger problem is that the symptoms of schizophrenia and paranoid delusions just happen to be the same as what these &quot;weapons&quot; are claimed to do. If you really must go down this path to insanity the answer is very simple, construct a faraday cage and sit inside of that. If you are so well-versed in these technologies why don&#39;t you know that?</p>

<p>I have an idea of how advanced TPTB weaponry is i just posted the links to their microwave mind control. Basically what you are saying.</p>

<p>But its probably only theoretical and even if it is real why would they target you? Do you know some big secret? I guess if they were targeting a certain type of the population that would make sense but right now only you are reporting it.</p>

<p>Lets get it out in the open to see if you are being targeted.</p>

<p>Are you Muslim?</p>

<p>Do you support Hezbollah/Hamas?</p>

<p>Do you think jews need to be killed?</p>

<p>Do you know secrets?</p>

<p>You into pedo?</p>

<p>.</p>

<p>If you answered yes to any of the above then you have a reason to be targeted, if not then they are not targeting you unless there is a reason.</p>

<p>Reasons for being targeted vary and some are targeted just cuz TPTB want to study them and advance their tech (a lot of people with high cognitive abilities or who could help humanity in big ways are targeted)</p>

<p>I want people to understand there is nothing very special about many targets and more people are targeted than you&#39;d think, to various degrees. Most of it is done for research purposes, the program is designed to make targets sound mentally ill and many targets have family issues, a history of mental illness or were veterans, they are chosen for various reasons and most are people with not many connections to get this info out or who the public will not believe.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Why do i think? Cause those are the people the government is targeting and you are scared of being targeted.</p>

<p>You have deflected the question 3 times now lets see if we can get number 4.</p>

<p>Are you a pedo?</p>

<p>Do you think all jews should die?</p>

<p>Just say no its easy, why 5 posts of agreeing with it?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It didnt say you werent a pedo/terrorist.</p>

<p>I read all about</p>

<p>delusions of persecution</p>

<p>delusions of grandeur</p>

<p>and paranoia </p>

<p>.</p>

<p>You gotta start convincing me you arent a bad person or having a mental break right now. Cause your behavior is beyond concerning.</p>

<p>That is the whole reason this line of questioning has begun. Yet every time you refuse to answer and deflect saying read the trigger posts. That is a sign of a liar, hence you are saying you are a pedo/terrorist. </p>

<p>Saying no would have taken one post yet here we are 6 or so posts into it.</p>

<p>Answer the questions already. </p>

<p>Are you a pedo??</p>

<p>Do you think all jews should die??</p>

<p>(watch) Nope dont like to diddle little kids and think jews are ok</p>
