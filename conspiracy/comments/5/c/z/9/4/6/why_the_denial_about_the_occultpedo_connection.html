        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I don&#39;t get the argument that this is all just a wacky conspiracy and to ignore the religious aspect of it - It has already been proven that the CATHOLIC CHURCH itself have pedos involved and had hiding it for years!! A belief and religion that millions of people trusted, and still do. why? because it&#39;s &quot;GOOD&quot; or &quot;HOLY&quot;?</p>

<p>Yet you want us to believe Satanic pedos DON&#39;T exist??? That they are a just a silly conspiracy, a myth, not real etc??</p>

<p>If Catholics were doing it and covering it up for decades, you better believe that Satanists are not only abusing kids for sex, but much worse.</p>

<p>Satan is 100% real to those that believe in him, just as much as a Christian believes in Christ. No different.</p>

<p>Pedos exists, it is NOT a conspiracy</p>

<p>The Occult and people that believe in it are REAL, it is NOT a conspiracy.</p>

<p>Most conspiracies start with just one of a few pieces of circumstantial evidence that are expanded in theory without further proof or conclusion.</p>

<p>THIS situation however, has a TON of evidence (email, photos, connections, proof that human trafficking exists) All of it is beyond circumstance and there are many solid conclusions being made.</p>

<p>Only about 5% of what has been found to theorized here to be debunked or proven false, all these doors to just darker and darker places...it never seems to end</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m skeptical of Pizzagate- not because it&#39;s improbable (I think there are pedofile networks, and they do use codewords), but because much of the evidence being used to back it up is forced.  There&#39;s no real evidence of the main focus of the theory- that pizza shops are being run by pedofiles in an elite political pedo network.</p>

<p>That said- Pizza shops are a cash heavy business that are good for laundering money.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think many of us, myself included, are NOT skeptical that the Wikileaks emails are <em>very</em> strange.</p>

<p>What many of us reasonably-minded truth seekers ARE skeptical of is a witch hunt focusing on potentially completely innocent businesses and their owners based solely on combinations of anonymous 4chan posts, questionable &quot;pedo codes,&quot; and instagram posts from hipster weirdos.</p>

<p>Many people in this sub are trying to claim this is all proven fact or at least close to it. So far, I have yet to see ONE shred of hard evidence that ties any of this together. All I&#39;ve seen is posts based off of info found in other posts based off of info found in other posts. We&#39;re getting to the point of a <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> game of satanic pedophile telephone in which users are accusing any and every pizza restaurant in the country of being involved in satanic child sex rituals just because they have a triangle or a swirl in their logo. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>My theory is this :</p>

<p>the Catholics pedos were purposely exposed to discredit ALL Christians. After that, they were no longer trusted to run oversea orphanages. It was after that, companies like the Clinton Foundation took over to fill the void....and completely corrupted it</p>

<p>makes you wonder who had the power and means to expose the catholic church, when they kept it hidden for so long</p>
