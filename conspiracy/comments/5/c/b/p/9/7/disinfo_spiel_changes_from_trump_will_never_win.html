    <div class="md"><p>There isn&#39;t one unified theory going on here.  Trump as a plant is one I thought looked plausible but wasn&#39;t the case, or was a failed plot.  Trump being a hand picked alternate is a theory I also thought plausible given what we know.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>What this election and the documents from Wikileaks make me realize is that while there&#39;s definitely shady shit going on and plenty of corruption, the whole thing seems to be a bunch of factions individually trying to game the system (and/or working with a few other factions) rather than a wide-spread single conspiracy with &quot;the elite&quot; at the top of the pyramid controlling and micromanaging everything under them to ensure HRC is elected.</p>

<p>To me, the picture looks a lot more like a lot of different size groups looking out for themselves... which in the end still ends up fucking regular people over, but is entirely less hopeless than a situation where you&#39;ve got one faction controlling everything.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s the most likely end fact of the matter.  You could even be generous and imagine each group being well meaning with good character, but the competition between the groups causing the damage.</p>

<p>I agree, an expansive Illuminati type group isn&#39;t needed to explain things.  People seem to have a limit to how much of an impact they can attribute to themselves, so when they make an error with catastrophic effect, they only blame themselves for the first domino in the row.  I think that&#39;s why banking, real estate, international crime and military groups all get bundled together in most conspiracies.  They are obviously dealing with things in such an abstract way that the damage they cause is invisible to themselves.</p>

<p>It&#39;s almost a relief to think that someone is doing all this shit on purpose, but I guess that&#39;s how we got religion.  If it wasn&#39;t for the occasional real conspiracy I&#39;d dismiss the whole thing.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is almost exactly what I was thinking. &quot;Trump is a plant. He will lose and his supporters will cause another civil war&quot; to &quot;well I&#39;m confused, that was unexpected&quot;. </p>

<p>Upon further reading, I currently feel like the exact opposite of my theory was true, the outcome was going to be the same regardless of who was elected, civil unrest probably followed by martial law, but instead of Trump supporters, they&#39;re going to use the same Craigslist protesters they always have. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s possible that it simply doesn&#39;t matter who won.  As has been noted, the Clintons were on good terms with the Trumps, and they share much of the same politics and social groups.</p>

<p>You can already see Trump walking back some of the things he campaigned on, including indicting Clinton.</p>

<p>&quot;He deflected a question on whether he would follow up on a campaign vow to appoint a special prosecutor to investigate his election opponent, Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton, over her use of a private email server while she was secretary of state: “It’s not something I’ve given a lot of thought, because I want to solve health care, jobs, border control, tax reform.”&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It does get old. I, for one, don&#39;t fully understand how Trump managed to win. It&#39;s clear that Hillary was the establishment&#39;s choice and they didn&#39;t prop her up just so Trump could win in the end. Trump getting elected makes me think the system may not be as rigged as I thought.</p>

<p>And no, I won&#39;t buy into the whole &quot;Trump was the establishment&#39;s choice and they now have you believing that the whole thing was legit&quot; shit.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This comment makes me wonder if that was the whole point.  Would people on the right and in Trump&#39;s corner have accepted the results if she had won on election night?  I think they would have actually rioted (not these isolated pockets of faux riots the news are so happy to cover).  Now, the right has seen these &quot;fools&quot; rioting and denounced them.  Many will be unwilling to appear hypocritical in doing the same thing, once the results are overturned.</p>

<p>All that remains to be awarded are Michigan&#39;s 16 electoral votes, with Trump leading by a mere 12000 votes.  If she is successful in &quot;winning&quot; Michigan, then all it takes is to claim that vote totals in Florida were tampered with (likely through hacking)...they will recount or award it to Clinton outright and the White House is hers.</p>

They&#39;ve never needed to be before. The plan was for Hillary to win. It seems to me like the plan B was to surround Trump with people like Giuliani and Gingrich, get them to ingratiate themselves with him as a failsafe. TPP was not supposed to fail. Putin was not supposed to make moves to become an ally of America. None of this was supposed to happen. It&#39;s a very exciting time, full of great opportunities. We need to make use of this.

    <div class="md"><p>Trump was MEANT TO get Hillary elected. <a href="http://www.inquisitr.com/3696795/you-all-know-that-the-clinton-campaign-deliberately-plotted-to-get-trump-nominated-right/">Wikileaks exposed an active strategy by the Clinton campaign to get the media to elevate bad Republicans during the primaries</a>. They specifically named Trump as one, and because of this strategy, Trump ended up getting literally more free media coverage than any other candidate, even from supposedly liberal media outlets. The same media outlets snubbed and smeared Bernie Sanders at the behest of the Clinton campaign. Donald&#39;s ridiculous amount of media attention gave him a serious advantage against the competition and Bernie&#39;s lack of coverage made it difficult for him to overcome the fraud being committed against his campaign. It was all for Hillary. </p>

<p>This plan obviously backfired for Clinton though. Her campaign encouraged the media to create a monster as controlled opposition, but that monster turned out to be a populist that they couldn&#39;t control. </p>

<p>Whereas people like us as are not really reveling in any kind of victory. We seem to be sitting back and waiting, generally.</p>

<p>Can this be a good thing? To have half of the public traumatized and the other half skeptical? I know that is am oversimplification but I am just thinking out loud.</p>

    <div class="md"><p><em>&quot;My method, my style, has always been to be open-minded, to be critical, to be rational, but to seek the weird. And to seek it seriously. Now, if you seek the weird without a critical intelligence, it will find you faster than you can lock your apartment behind you! The number of squirrelly ideas on the market these days is truly alarming. I coined a phrase (I hope), &quot;the balkanization of epistemology&quot;. This is what we&#39;re dealing with now. You understand what I mean? It means people can&#39;t tell shit from Shinola, but they wanna talk about it, a lot! This is a place where you have to bring to bear what are called razors, logical razors.  One is: hypotheses should not be multiplied without necessity.  Another is: equations should not be multiplied without necessity.  Razors always seek what is called the principle of parsimony. In other words, keep it simple, stupid. The simplest explanation is always to be preferred first.&quot;</em></p>

    <div class="md"><p>I mean, there was a discussion about voter fraud and manipulation. About how you couldnt make it a land slide victory. Same with brexit. You woild have to spend a whole lot of time planning and shoot for a close victory within a few points.  Just humans are fickle as fuck and hard to predict some times, so ppl fucked up. But, they probably have a back up plan. So we shall see what goes down in the coming months. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>TPTB pulled a fast one, what can ya say...I personally think it is all being orchestrated and they did a phenomenal job with discrediting conspiracy theorists even further. Anyone else find it crazy how the exact opposite of what George Soros predicted is what happend?</p>

<p>I so think at this point nobody has a clue what is actually going on. Obama 3rd term is my ultimate prediction. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Depends who i shill for. I charge far more to shill for Clinton than i do for Trump. The best is how i make 2 accounts and have debates back and forth on <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a>. Account 1 shills for Clinton, account 2 shills for Trump. It makes for some hilarity while getting PAID.</p>

<p>My other account name is <a href="/u/skankhunt_42">/u/skankhunt_42</a></p>
