<p><strong>testing the Pizza Pages</strong> - your list</p>

<p><strong>As of today we are able to test the new credit card landing pages</strong></p>

<p><strong>(Pizza).</strong></p>

<p>We have until the end of the week to find as many bugs / errors / <strong>weird
stuff before launching to real visitors.</strong> Below you&#39;ll find a list of
questions I&#39;ve come up with that i need your help in thoroughly testing.
These questions are tailored specifically toward your department and we
are relying on you to find any problems. </p>

<p>As you go through the different scenarios please take notes on <strong>anything
that seems weird</strong> or doesn&#39;t work. </p>

<p><strong>Additionally, If you just notice something that doesnt make sense</strong> (even if
it&#39;s not on on your question list), make a note. </p>

<p>To reduce clutter, all feedback should be sent directly to me as soon as
possible. *<em>Do not open any new IT tickets. *</em></p>

<p>Please use as many web browsers as you have available. </p>

<p>If you end up in the &quot;Original&quot; Credit Card campaign version, in order to
see the new version you&#39;ll have to clear your stratfor cookies and refresh
the page. <strong>Once you have the Pizza version</strong> You should be able to view all
campaign pages in the new version, even if you close your browser and come
back later. </p>

<h2>Your Questions - Service Dept</h2>

<p>1) Are test pages (both A &amp;B versions) pushing the right data to iPay?</p>

<ul>
<li><p>refcode</p></li>
<li><p>modality</p></li>
<li><p>price</p></li>
<li><p>address</p></li>
<li><p>premium attached? Shipping? (only on newly created campaign pages)</p></li>
<li><p>Which version of the campaign page they came from (old or new)</p></li>
</ul>

<p>2) <strong>International Orders being processed properly?</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><p>What about any common <strong>international order processing</strong> issues? </p></li>
<li><p>Does postal code box map to the right spot in ipay? </p></li>
</ul>

<p>3) Does the <em>Questions</em> tile work?</p>

<p>4) does the page show as secure in all browsers (SSL?)</p>

<hr/>

<p>Any idea what this means? They are an intelligence firm are they not? Also have seen Pizza mentioned in emails from USAID and Stratfor. What gives? Even if it was pizza, who ships pizza internationally?</p>

<p>ANYONE willing to help, please try and use this lead, I don&#39;t know where else to go with it but it could be something. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Disturbingly, yes, it sounds like something like that. I&#39;m a web developer, and their would be no reason for me to beta test international orders, unless that was a part of the business. Like OP said, who ships pizza internationally? No one. Unless they are an ingredients distributor. Which is why this lead needs to be followed, imo.</p>

If you are afraid for your own personal safety, understandable, but please don&#39;t try to talk anyone else out of being brave and doing the right thing. No one needs to go full vigilante, but if we make enough noise for long enough, then others will eventually have to pay attention.

<p>Check this article out from 1989: <a href="http://educate-yourself.org/tg/franklincoverupexcerptwashtimesphoto.shtml">http://educate-yourself.org/tg/franklincoverupexcerptwashtimesphoto.shtml</a>.  A prostitution ring was busted in Washington with a lot of ties to the white house.  It looks like credit cards played a large roll as that&#39;s how most payments were made and that is why the house got raided.</p>

<p>The address to this house?</p>

<p>6004 34th Place NW.  7 minutes from our favorite pizza place, Comet Ping Pong.</p>

<p>That area stinks, and it has for 30+ years apparently.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Nothing about this seems weird other than the pizza thing. However the web developer could have simply chosen fake products, in this case pizza.</p>

<p>It&#39;s very likely fake products to make sure the data (the payment/shipping information) is sending the right data to an internal test server that gathers that data. Once everything is a go, they will change out the fake products for real ones and actually send the data to ipay. </p>

<p>There are plenty of tutorials for learning a language that involve ordinary things like pizza. In fact I think the last time I was trying to learn java, one of the lessons was a pizza ordering web page.</p>

<p>scroll down for the views...</p>

<p>to me it looks like they were just testing different designs on the subscription pages for their &#39;normal&#39; intelligence services, and this project somehow ended up with the internal codeword &quot;pizza&quot;.</p>

<p>PS: which does <strong>not</strong> mean i dismiss the pizzagate allegations, just that in this specific case we are following a dead end</p>

<li><p>Art purchases (Hey I had my MKULTRA artist at the last pizza party and she saw everything. Her alters are painting some fucked up shit. Buy her dog shit art at the gallery for $50,000 and i&#39;ll let you in the back door to the pizza place for a 10 pm all ages party)</p></li>
