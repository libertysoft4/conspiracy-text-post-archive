<p>Yes, they do in fact do that.  Right after the Romney loss last time, it was widely reported that Romney left a lot of his closest workers stranded.  Their business cards stopped working literally during his concession speech, and they all had to fly home on their own dime after working for years for him.  CTR has almost certainly been disbanded, with maybe a skeleton crew left to attempt to make her not look too bad on the way out the door. </p>

I&#39;m sure there are also some sort of FEC filings somewhere if you care to search since I think its a 501c. Astroturfing to correct the Clintons&#39; record has been going for even longer though, Brock has been in business a long time.</p>
