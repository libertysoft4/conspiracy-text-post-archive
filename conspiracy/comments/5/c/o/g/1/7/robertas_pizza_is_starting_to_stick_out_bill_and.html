There is no fucking of kids going on at Roberta&#39;s I assure you. There is the fucking of legal hipster girls tho, and the recreational use of drugs like molly and cocaine. But it&#39;s far from an Eyes Wide Shut scene, I promise. </p>

Not only are you totally ignorant, you are exactly the reason why some people may be on the fence about taking this shit seriously.  Get out of your parents basement.

    <div class="md"><p>I guess my &quot;sore spot&quot; is ignorance. As a New Yorker, I guess I&#39;m naturally defensive about places I hang out at. I mean I get it, being an outsider with no connection to Bushwick, you probably have this vision in your head about some illuminati operation. But it couldn&#39;t be further from the truth. I&#39;ll be happy to take video footage next time I go there so you can get the vibe. It&#39;s a cool place in a cool neighborhood, where good-looking hipsters go to socialize and get laid. They serve Italian food, but it&#39;s mainly a few rooms and an outdoor area with picnic tables to just chill with your friends and drink. I&#39;ve been there until they closed many nights, and not weird shit goes on. The fact the Clintons may have went there once is not a green light to start viral rumors about a place that I happen to enjoy going to. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You are absolutely right about people pushing way too hard at angles.  The whole &quot;you are definitely trying to shy me away from something&quot; is a perfect example of the problem with many of these conspiracy subs.  Make any comment to detract from a specific theory, and you are a shill.</p>

<p>Whether it is shills or misdirected people, I feel that the general wave of &quot;pizza hysteria&quot; is going that way.  Everyone seems to want to think Pizza is code, but I am hesitant to believe that.  I am not saying it is never code (Hell I&#39;ve known for about 15-20 years now that you always avoid Cheese Pizza!), but sometimes a Pizza really is just a pizza.  </p>
