<p>This is a serious question though.  Any of you who have seen <em>rich man&#39;s trick</em> or know about mkultra knows the lengths the elite will go to.  I&#39;ve met ignorant people often, but how many of them were playing ignorant?  Most of what I&#39;ve seen has been a manipulation tactic to rope impressionable people into following along (think butters from south park).  Today, especially, does white racism still exist (because while I have seen it on TV plenty, I have not seen a true racist white guy in a while).</p>

<p>This is prompted by that little occultist with her dumb fuck theory about white men being like isis.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;Racist&quot; isn&#39;t sufficiently well defined.  I personally know some white guys who, while not extremely racist, are unable to ignore the slightest fault in any ethnic minority while being fairly forgiving of whites.</p>

<p>The one TV quality racist I met had spent years in prison, ended up in a racist prison gang, and carried the aggressive fear toward blacks and Hispanics with him outside of prison.  It was apparently a survival thing for him, permanently damaged by our corrections system.</p>

<p>So yes, I think it exists, but that racism manifesting as holding minorities to higher standards is more common than more exciting versions of racism.  But that&#39;s just anecdotes, and I&#39;m just some random PNW person, so what do I know.</p>

<p>that&#39;s pretty damn valid, but my question is really about how much of white racism is a psyop.  ...probably should have made that more clear.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, we know that media portrayals of racism are inaccurate to the facts of racism in how it is expressed.  Reasons for exaggerating it could be benign, or malevolent, but are likely a mix of the two.  Knowing what proportion is deliberately faked by the government would be tough to untangle.</p>

<p>This past US election is a good place to start.  While both candidates can easily be implicated in systemic racism, Trump&#39;s hiring practices and Clinton&#39;s mass incarceration, the focus was entirely on Trump&#39;s words.  This is obviously a deliberate tactic to ensure that performances of racism were more visible and disabled conversation regarding more troubling brands of racism that both candidates exhibit.</p>

<p>This doesn&#39;t require deliberate government meddling of course.  We have our archetypes in entertainment media, and the news media relies in those archetypes for clearer messaging.  However, since we know that the exaggeration of Trump&#39;s race oriented remarks were exaggerated through selective editing motivated by the Clinton campaign, we know that the usage of those archetypes for specific effect were indeed used as a tool by the government to influence the election.  It would certainly be worth while to watch for instances of performative racism being highlighted and seeing how often it is used to paint over the rest of the story.  Since we saw instances of criticism of Clinton being erased through leverage of misogynistic comments made by allies of those who would criticize her, this may be a super common tactic of news media.</p>

<p>The origin of the racist caricature is also important.  Oakies and Whitetrash as terms came from 1830s and were used to describe poor whites, white servants, and rural whites.  During the civil war, the term Whitetrash was elevated to use in the upper class and included poor southerners who weren&#39;t politically involved but didn&#39;t own slaves.  The implication was of course that these poor white southerners hated blacks so much that they refused to vote in their own best interests out of spite.  Grant had this to say about poor whites: <a href="http://www.bartleby.com/1011/41.html">http://www.bartleby.com/1011/41.html</a></p>

<p>&quot;There was no time during the rebellion when I did not think, and often say, that the South was more to be benefited by its defeat than the North. The latter had the people, the institutions, and the territory to make a great and prosperous nation. The former was burdened with an institution abhorrent to all civilized people not brought up under it, and one which degraded labor, kept it in ignorance, and enervated the governing class. With the outside world at war with this institution, they could not have extended their territory. The labor of the country was not skilled, nor allowed to become so. The whites could not toil without becoming degraded, and those who did were denominated “poor white trash.” The system of labor would have soon exhausted the soil and left the people poor. The non-slaveholders would have left the country, and the small slaveholder must have sold out to his more fortunate neighbor. Soon the slaves would have outnumbered the masters, and, not being in sympathy with them, would have risen in their might and exterminated them. The war was expensive to the South as well as to the North, both in blood and treasure, but it was worth all it cost.&quot;</p>

<p>He presents poor whites as helpless, unskilled, and future victims of liberated blacks.  This shows his contempt for the poor, and his fear of black freedom, but he uses both together to admonish poor whites for not voting with the north.  With the end of the civil war, the Whitetrash got linked to the racism inherent in the US slave system despite being victims of economic bondage.  Essentially, political elites scapegoated poor southerners to take the fall for rich southerners socially.  At this point you have the &quot;poor rural white = racist slave supporter&quot; archetype established as part of a war time coercion method.</p>

<p>The fact that the rural south is mocked by liberals after every election, for being racist, shows that this particular bundle of traits is still used as a cultural bludgeon to coerce adherence to the elite political vision.</p>

<p>Modern ways of reinforcing this belief focus entirely on language, more performative racism.  Rather than look at where more minorities are imprisoned, we have a tendency to look for where people use derogatory terms for race.  By coding racist=people who say bad words, an educated elite can claim not to be racist simply by knowing which words to avoid.  So we see this same practice being constantly reinforced.</p>

<p>So is it a deliberate political subversive trend masterminded by shadowy elites?  Probably not, it looks more like assholes returning to the trough of power looking for the old weapons that always seem to work.  I&#39;d say the preservation of the caricature is a psyop, and modifications made to that collection of traits are most definitely.  The recent cultural bundle created by Clinton&#39;s campaign, &quot;the alt right&quot;, is a method of expanding the group of people who can be hated through membership along increasingly more abstract lines.</p>

<p>So... maybe?</p>

<p>I&#39;m only up to this point in your post, but I can&#39;t move past this line without mentioning <a href="https://youtu.be/QBCaKX6n5pU?t=155">this</a> and wondering if there was anything more racist during the entire election season.  I think this tops Trump&#39;s Mexican speech---which IMO has been taken wildly out of context.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I would say yes, racism exists, but there has been a deliberate move by the establishment to expand its meaning for political purposes. Racism as I understand it is hating people because of their skin color. This to me seems to be almost entirely dead in the U.S. But if you choose to accept an expanded definition of the term, you could include things like unconscious bias which basically asserts that you are racist and don&#39;t know it because of the privileges you have or because of that way you&#39;ve been socialized. Institutional racism is real. I believe that. But I think we need to be careful that we are not calling people racists using an expanded definition of the word. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Today especially?</p>

<p>It exists, but is far smaller than black racists.  (I mean extremely small).</p>

<p>Instead what you see is black racists calling random white guys racists until they snap and start speaking a little bit racist.  When you have people pushing you and calling you names, you start to generalize.</p>

<p>What is happening is, by select blacks being so brute-like with their own racism, they are creating racism, instead of stopping racism.  (they even attack their own, which is ridiculous even if they are racist, calling them uncle toms and whatnot.  It&#39;s like they are 30-40 years behind the white man.  If you look at their progression over time (not all black, like I said, these select individuals were like select whites were 30-40+ years ago.)</p>
