<p>Our government funds terrorists groups in Syria who behead 12 year old boys, give billions our hard earned dollars to Israel so that they can kill Palestinians and expand their territory, violate our privacy and spy on us every day in the name of fighting terrorism, and many other terrible things. You get the picture. Yet you don&#39;t see those dumbasses protesting that shit. They just brush it off as crazy conspiracy theories and go to back to getting their thinking fodder from the media. It&#39;s bullshit.</p>

<p>&quot;Trump is a misogynist&quot; I guess that&#39;s why he employs hundreds of women in his businesses? Because he hates them so much? And I suppose that&#39;s why he&#39;s been happily married to Melania for years now? Don&#39;t you think she would have come out and said something if he was an asshole? Use some common sense. Most people like to bring up that pussy comment he made, but most men talk like that all the time! And many times say things far worse! He said this in private to one of his buddies too. Goddamn.</p>

<p>&quot;Trump is a xenophobe&quot; Because he&#39;s against illegal immigration? If he was truly a xenophobe, he&#39;d be against legal immigration as well.</p>

<p>Jesus  I mean I could go on and on but even if these things were true, <em>he would not be able to pass any policies that represent these beliefs</em>. The other branches would shut that shit down. I don&#39;t understand what those dumbasses don&#39;t understand about that. He&#39;s not perfect by any means, and he&#39;s said some inflammatory shit, I get that, but come on people. Look at what Hillary Clinton has <em>done</em>. Do you really think she would be a better president?</p>

They mocked us. They ridiculed us.<br/>
They fucking sent police disbanding the protest, when we had our permitttttttt.     </p>

Protesting against trump is democracy.<br/>
Protesting against hillary is not democracy.   </p>

They dont like trump for his discriminating behavior, yet they are the one discriminating, labeling, accusing bernie people.      </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m a Marxist, and although other Marxists (particularly of the Leninist/Maoist persuasion) will disagree with me, I am vehemently opposed to the PC/SJW culture that is raging today. Political Correctness, Racism, Sexism, et al is what we refer to as &quot;Identity Politics.&quot; Marxists, first and foremost, adhere to the philosophy of Dialectical Materialism that dictates that we are products of our material existence and our material surroundings (the opposite is idealism - the philosophy that our ideas dictate reality). One important aspect of Dialectical Materialism is to examine the whole rather than the part, as the part can often represent a misleading &quot;abstraction.&quot; I call this &quot;Exclusionary Detailing&quot; and this is how many ideologies continue to thrive in this postmodern late stage capitalist world (e.g. Religion thrives on the ignorance of its followers to the contradictions presented by science either by force or the promotion of cognitive dissonance). All of those aforementioned aspects of Identity Politics are abstractions that obscure the true nature of the contradiction - a class based contradiction of the haves vs. the have nots, or as classical Marxists say the &quot;Bourgeoisie&quot; vs the &quot;Proletariat.&quot; Focusing on abstract externalities, such as race, gender, etc. are easy concepts to grasp for most people but they really ignore and obfuscate the bigger picture that these disputes are REALLY about class. Focusing on them also helps to maintain the existence of the class structure by maintaining these illusionary divides. As long as people say &quot;race&quot; or &quot;gender&quot; is what is the problem, that also re-validates the idea that race and gender are valid separations of humanity.</p>

<p>Now people will argue that Racism and Sexism do exist - sure, they do, but they are a result of class warfare. Think of where this narrative of racism and sexism is primarily coming from? Perhaps its the media? The wealthy, who have the most to gain from keeping the poor divided and fighting amongst themselves? And who embraces it? The poor, the uneducated, those whom these abstractions provide an easy answer to the problems in the world? It&#39;s easy to blame your problems on someone else, it&#39;s far harder to look inwards and say that I&#39;m part of the problem. We need to abandon the rhetoric of identity politics and realize that this the masses of poor are being duped by the small amount of wealthy in the world, and this is the way it&#39;s been for ages. The poor/workers need to be united in order to illicit real change - and they never will be so long as they adhere to and validate the divides of race, gender and other identity politics. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Watch this if you intend to understand the roots of political correctness. Don&#39;t trust someone who tells you PC culture is not fundamentally rooted from marxism, politically correct culture sprang from the cultural marxists which started in the Frankfurt School. The frankfurt school was a group that intended to import European ideals into America by a methodical slow subversion of American principles and ideals such as individualism and mistrust of authority. You can learn about it here, and I implore you to watch this video and educate yourself. You can immunize yourself against the subversive forces only by educating yourself: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz8pzG02oxU">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz8pzG02oxU</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>It comes from the idea of deconstruction, which is the Marxist process of breaking something down into its integral parts, usually in a modernizing process. We have deconstruction in the arts, which leads to modern art, we have deconstruction of cultural norms, which leads to degeneracy, and we have deconstruction in every aspect of society to uproot the Christian roots of American society and replace them with qualities that were more acceptable in Europe, socialized medicine, top-down government, authoritarian government.  </p>

<p>&quot;Finally, both varieties of (cultural and economic) Marxists employ a method of analysis designed to show the correctness of their ideology in every situation. For classical Marxists, the analysis is economic. For cultural Marxists, the analysis is linguistic: deconstruction. Deconstruction &quot;proves&quot; that any &quot;text&quot;, past or present, illustrates the oppression of Muslims, women, homosexuals, etc. by reading that meaning into words of the text (regardless of their actual meaning). Both methods are, of course, phony analyses that twist the evidence to fit preordained conclusions, but they lend a &#39;scientific&quot; air to the ideology.&quot;\</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The Frankfurt School (what you all call &quot;Cultural Marxism&quot;) was created by liberals, capitalists, and socialists who did not believe in removing capitalism (who are therefore not socialists, correct?).</p>

<p>Socialism/Communism cannot exist within the capitalist framework and the Liberals created the Frankfurt School to attempt to demonstrate that you could correct for the (edit: social) inequities of capitalism without dismantling it (edit: to correct the economic inequities).</p>

<p>It&#39;s quite obvious why it failed, it&#39;s like treating cancer by giving a person an aspirin. When the economics of capitalism are what create racism, misogyny in the first place. The Frankfurt School is not &quot;socialism&quot; or &quot;marxism&quot; it&#39;s identity politics put into practice. </p>

<p>No you don&#39;t. The USSR, Cuba, North Korea, China et al were NOT communist despite labelling themselves as such. A rock can call itself a cloud but that doesn&#39;t make it a cloud. Those nations were State Capitalist or borderline Socialist at best. Communism is a term describing a <strong>stateless, classless, moneyless society with common ownership of the means of production.</strong> So the very idea that Communism, a concept that requires a stateless society can &quot;lead to a government&quot; is utterly ridiculous. </p>

<p>Also, if you&#39;re employing the &quot;muh human nature&quot; arguement you DEFINITELY don&#39;t know what Communism is.</p>

The only difference between you, and me, is that when you seize control of the state, before dissolving it you do not intend to return the ill-gotten gains of your corporate friends back to the people you propose allowing them to keep it to create a new stateless serfdom.</p>

<p>Explain how you can remove the state, remove the state&#39;s protections for workers, allow capitalism to exist, and not create a new government based on oligarchy in one fell swoop? You pretend like giving the state&#39;s power to the private owner isn&#39;t going to end up creating a new state. Find the poor person who can afford to make sure your non-aggression principle cannot be violated, without a state to enforce it. That&#39;s what blows my god damned mind with you people. You recognize the problem (that the State concentrates power into the hands of specific business interests) but somehow you arrived at an absolutely twisted conclusion as to how to fix it.</p>

<p>Please read a fucking book sometime. I implore you. You seem to have a brain, so why don&#39;t you use it?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Russia was not communist. We have never had communism, just as we have never had anarcho-capitalism. It is difficult to argue with you about communism when you already conflate the USSR with what communism is. </p>

<p>Please also remember that I am not a communist and do not advocate for stalinism, marxism, trotskyism, etc. I am not a maoist and you cannot debate me like I am a maoist. And you really want to debate a marxist or a maoist it seems. So, I implore you to ask some of these questions in <a href="/r/DebateaCommunist">/r/DebateaCommunist</a> or <a href="/r/socialism">/r/socialism</a>, the people in those communities are far more intelligent and better at speaking than who you are talking to. And you&#39;ll get to debate an actual communist.</p>

<p>Most communists want a vanguard party to rise to power, seize control for the people, and then dissolve the state. I think that is impossible. I think the USSR is a good exemplar of why. But there are other kinds of communism.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Ahaha. I get it, I present like an elitist asshole. That&#39;s cool you asked questions when I present it this way, though. If I could say, it&#39;s sort of intentional, I&#39;m fishing for troll responses and when I get someone like you who asks legitimate questions in spite of the asshole they&#39;re talking to I know I wont &quot;offend&quot; you easily without personal attacks. This is good, it means we can have an adult discussion! If you&#39;re willing to ask a total fucking asshole these questions you might be willing to read the answers.</p>

<p>The question you asked has a long and complicated answer so I apologize in the beginning if this is TL;DR. But I&#39;m sure you expected somewhat of a detailed answer. I am trying to provide a clear and concise one.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Can you tell me more about Libertarian Socialism? I&#39;m unfamiliar with it as well.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I think a lot of people are familiar with the concept, just not the terminology.</p>

<p>To begin, Libertarian Socialism is a flavor of socialism (it&#39;s actually an umbrella term covering several different and more specific flavors of socialism) where the adherents are anti-authoritarian and also socialist. We reject the doctrine that the Vanguard Party should seize the state and centralize the economy. For various reasons we feel central control over the economy is not the correct direction to go. You&#39;ll get many different theories on that, but mine is still that power corrupts and vesting all of the control over the economy in a small group will inevitably lead to an antidemocratic government obsessed with nothing else but furthering it&#39;s own power. This is the same criticism that right-libertarians apply to socialists, as well. I don&#39;t necessarily believe it&#39;s human nature, rather the nature of governance itself that causes this. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t remember who the quote is from, but someone far smarter than me once said that &quot;the kind of person who wants to be in power is the last person you want taking the job.&quot; Could be paraphrasing someone, but I hold that truism in high regard.</p>

<p>As an alternative to central planning we propose worker&#39;s self-management over the economy where businesses run as cooperatives with democratic control. To achieve these goals we advocate for worker&#39;s councils, democratic control over workplaces, and trade unions. We want to dismantle the authority we have seen vested in other institutions and return it to people, but we want workplace relationships and economic participation to be voluntary. We&#39;re still individualists.</p>

<p>There&#39;s a lot of different &quot;views&quot; that technically fall under this umbrella and it takes a lot of sorting and reading to have a good understanding of it all. You have Anarcho-Syndicalism, Libertarian Marxism (which is actually probably a good place to start for anyone who is both critical of Marxism-Leninism and things like Trotskyism directly, and also critical of capitalism and reformist liberals), anarchism as an umbrella probably falls under here, Collectivist Anarchism, etc.</p>

<p>Some good reading (to start) on libertarian-socialist concepts would be Mikhail Bakunin&#39;s &quot;Collectivist Anarchism&quot;. You can also read &quot;The Soul of Man under Socialism&quot; by Oscar Wilde, anything written by Rudolf Rocker like his pamphlet &quot;Anarcho Syndicalism&quot; from the 1930s. If you&#39;re interested in Libertarian Marxism, reading some of Marx and Engels&#39; later works like &quot;The Civil War in France&quot; will give you a good starting point.</p>

<p>I would describe myself as an Anarcho-Syndicalist generally. I believe we should be strengthening and joining labor unions, I think unions could organize workers as a second government if they got large enough and peacefully (or non-peacefully) replace the current system. I don&#39;t particularly support some of the larger, more bourgeois unions in the USA because they have been corrupted, but something like the IWW could grow to be a governmental-sized agency that advocates for workers.</p>

<p>We believe that only direct action will serve to get us closer to our liberation, so protests and general strikes and demonstrations, versus indirect action like voting for a capitalist like Hillary Clinton or Bernie Sanders to change the world for us. I voted for Bernie, but if we had President Sanders I&#39;d still want to protest in the streets and strike. We think that all workers should support one another and drop racism, sexism, homophobia, and other distractions created by the capitalist system to divide us. I, personally, don&#39;t believe in this liberal tumblr oppression point shit. I&#39;m a transwoman, I&#39;m poor, and a child abuse victim, and I hate it when liberals try to enter me into the damned Oppression Olympics. I resent being used as a pawn in this way and I resent that HRC thought I&#39;d vote for her because I&#39;m a transwoman. </p>

<p>In my mind, if you are a worker, anywhere in the world, and not a boss or a landlord then you are being oppressed, and we are all being oppressed equally. I believe all oppression in the world; from racism to sex trafficking to misogyny comes from the capitalist system that seeks to force us all into divided groups where we must compete for scraps as the 0.1% who owns our world profits and takes rent. I don&#39;t think there&#39;s a need for these people -- we could run this shit ourselves with democracy and voluntary association. </p>

<p>I believe that the perfect world would involve pro-worker organizations and the workers themselves organizing, and creating a government based on voluntary associations in the workplace and democratic ownership. Under this system there is nothing stopping multiple democratic worker-based organizations from &#39;competing&#39; to use a capitalist&#39;s term, to organize their own workers. There&#39;s nothing stopping us from having multiple levels of worker organization. As long as workers and people who want to work are the ones being represented and calling the shots I&#39;m not too concerned with the organization.</p>

<p>I hope I gave you a good place to start. Feel free to ask any more questions that come to you and I will do my best to answer although if your questions are beyond the scope of what I can answer or beyond what I feel confident to answer I&#39;ll try to point you towards someone who can answer your questions.</p>

<p><strong>TL;DR:</strong> Fuck you, this is a a complex question so read the complex answer. The desire for simple answers about socialism and communism is the reason people on the real left have to keep fighting this battle.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The &quot;state&quot; as it exists is nothing more than a tool of oppression. It exists purely to maintain the rule of the few over the many - the rich over the poor. You&#39;re conflating the workings of government such as the concepts of police, health care, maintainance of infrastructure, etc. with the state. These systems will exist within communist societies, and likely maintained by systems of democratic government, they will just not be used as tools of oppression. The police would promote equality from those who would wish to exploit others, rather than the other way around - as it is now. Communism doesn&#39;t imply that everyone will be left to their own and they will magically all get along - simply that the state, as it exists now, will no longer exist. Communism represents a diametric shift in values - the needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few. </p>

<p>Wrong! There is both nurture and nature. Some things shape us, others are already hard wired and inevitably lead to bullshit.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Of course we would, because people have an inner need for individualism based expression and will naturally join the groups/movements/beliefs that interest them. Post scarcity won;t change shit about human nature</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Communists advocate for a stateless, money-less society with democratic worker ownership over the factories and the capital (defined commonly as the &#39;means of production&#39;). There are many different kinds of Communism and vastly different theories on how to achieve this goal.</p>

<p>Your primary criticism seems to be leveled at the belief of a &#39;vanguard party&#39; who will seize all the power with the goal of the eventual dissolution of the state and the return of the power to the people. Many Communists also criticize this concept, because it goes against the (apparent) nature of humans to give up power once <del>given</del> edit: seized. You are confusing Marxist-leninist philosophy as if it represents all Communists. It&#39;s the same thing as if I took Donald Trump and said he represents all conservatives. You are committing the same error you (figurative you) accuse liberals of committing. </p>

<p>Not all Communists, socialists, etc. believe that we require a vanguard party to take back what belongs to us. I personally do not believe that under current conditions a vanguard could be created that would be &#39;above corruption&#39;.</p>

<p>Capitalism, and especially globalized capitalism, creates a system that rewards sociopathy and greed. &quot;Human Nature&quot; is a product of the systems that created it and the system that created our current nature is one that pits man against woman, black against white, poor against working poor, and muslim against christian. </p>

<p>You are making the argument that a system that did <em>not</em> reward greed, hoarding, and sociopaths behavior would then again turn around and create more sociopaths and greedy people. I do not follow this logic. </p>

<p>This is already wired into people&#39;s minds. You can can do research on cultures that existed prior to our current globalized capitalism system, and find sociopathy, inequality, infighting, dominance, and other ego/animal/sociopath qualities that exist because of human nature.</p>

<p>It is much different. Before there was barter/trade/precious metals, whereas today you have out-of-thin-air printed paper that isn&#39;t backed to anything other than Oil (For USD) which causes us to invade and control (try to) various middle east countries to keep this scam going, or else there will be a massive collapse of the dollar and Hyperinflation in the U.S. on the level of the Great Depression but even worse than that.</p>

<p>This current system and unchecked capitalism (lead by said corrupted human nature/sociopathy) is why everything is currently fucked up.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Even if you implement a true Communism, let&#39;s say one that many experts/intellectuals are discussing as being possible once Robotics/A.I./Singularity comes, even then Sociopathy/Human Nature via Egotism and Individualism will always look to manipulate, overthrow, get positions of power or create them.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Communists propose an alternative society without a state.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It&#39;s impossible and will never happen unless you have Humans 2.0 which have completely transcended sociopathy/animalism/biased limited mental capacity, and at the point you might as well be discussing some sort of Spiritual or Post Modern Utopia</p>

<blockquote>
<p>There will be no government to abuse people under communism.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Impossible because again, Human nature. Abuse is part of Human nature and happens on level Micros and Macro.</p>

<p>Micro you have abuse via relationships, parenting, between individuals or small groups of individuals.</p>

<p>Macro you have situations like Gulags, Polpot, Concentration camps, control over the collective, etc</p>

<p>If this election cycle has taught me anything, it&#39;s not to rely on the media to tell me how to think... especially about our citizenry. Trump supporters aren&#39;t racist rednecks. And I&#39;m not going to buy into the MSM&#39;s perception that they&#39;re spoon-feeding me about Clinton supporters.</p>

<p>Look at <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a> post-election because that&#39;s the best indicator of millennials. Most <em>hated</em> Clinton and wanted Sanders. I have a lot of faith that they aren&#39;t engaging in this protest, especially with so much news about hired protestors. It&#39;s such a small fraction that yet again, is being exacerbated by the media to create the perception that it&#39;s real. They did the same thing to Trump supporters much to their frustration, but it&#39;s unfortunate that Trump supporters now view this and assume that this is the real face of liberals.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ehh, you might want to calm down on that just a tad. As someone who knows a few people who live and work in the Bay Area, not every single one of them is smug, and selling things at a 1000% markup. Most people who just work are just that, working. They work to feed themselves and their families and happen to have a slightly different outlook on the world. The Bay Area is notorious for being SHW central, but that isn&#39;t wholly indicative of the entire populace of that area.</p>

<p>Are they, though? Who speaks for the protesters? Where did you get this narrative? </p>

<p>The elites are always taking protests and portraying them as things they are not, so the public can malign them and go back to sleep. OWS was a perfect example. It was an illegal hobo camp that was causing health hazards. Most people believed that, and they even paid homeless people to make it so, just so Americans would go back to sleep. In every protest now, I have learned to be extra-cautious of the narratives that build up around it, especially early on. </p>

I HATE the Clintons - ever since whitewater and the pardon of Marc Rich.  Mr Clinton repealed the bucket law that caused the recession and ruined my life.  If I never see another Clinton again in my life (that means YOU CHELSEA), it&#39;ll be too soon.
However, President Cheney started a war that has now ruined our economy, the middle east, and our privacy and the repercussions are still going.
Democrats are the party that protect minority rights, environment, consumers, etc.  Everyone knows it, but nobody votes for them because they are &quot;ineffective&quot;.  You know why they&#39;re ineffective?  Because they don&#39;t fight dirty.  Republicans are willing to &quot;burn it down&quot; to get their way, but they manage to do that under a Democratic president.  All I want is for my party to realize this is LONG TERM.  I want them to block everything - NO compromise, and I want them to destroy the economy (go ahead - block the budget - ruin our credit).  I want every single Republican voter to declare bankruptcy under president Trump, so that the ENTIRE nation will finally put the pieces together that the tea party and this greed driven, selfish, homophobic, misogynistic, xenophobic, isolationist thinking is NOT constructive.  You think David Duke is going to let go of a &quot;grudge&quot;?  F<strong>k that, and f</strong>k you for your appeasment position.  This is a fight for my society - not a &quot;grudge&quot;.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, it&#39;s a Jewish state and the official religion is Judaism. Because it was founded after the Holocaust and Jews have spread around the world, some voluntary and some by force it was made into a law allowing any jew to become a citizen in part to prevent some of the things that happened during WW2 where jews were forcibly expelled from some countries and no other country would allow them in. (look up MS St. Louis)</p>

<p>There are many countries that require its residents to carry ID cards and show them to officials. Even in the US, there are 24 states that require you to show them and ID card is asked. I&#39;m sure that you will not have any problems finding info indication that certain minorities are stopped more often than others in the US.</p>

<p>As for the Palestinians whether they were expelled or left because the Arab countries said that if they didn&#39;t leave there would be problems after they destroyed Israel is another debate that I&#39;m not going to get into. Did you know that most Palestinians that settled in the neighboring Arab countries are also living in camps and are unable to obtain citizenship in the countries where they live? </p>

<p>There is more than enough blame to go around for all the countries in the Mideast. Less not forget the issues that were created by the way the British divided up the Mideast into countries.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>They are useless idiots.  Which I mean to be the opposite of useful idiots--they don&#39;t earn the illuminati any points and in fact only take them away faster.  And by this I mean they are <em>re-resonating CTR and other artifacts of a failed memetic warfare</em>, and in the process they are only compounding their karmic freefall at a later time when they finally get a grip.  </p>

<p>A lot of them are going to find out the truth eventually, and when that happens many will fall into heavy drug use, self-destructive self-abuse or even commit suicide for being so wrong for so long.  I suspect though, this is a long way off.  Like if and when we finally get justice for 9/11 by taking the criminals like the entire bush family, guiliani and the vast network of the cog goverment / corporate pirate class</p>

<p>So my point is do what you can to educate them patiently and handle them with care: their awakening is going to be ugly and rife with downfall</p>

    <div class="md"><p>People aren&#39;t just sore loosers.  People are afraid for their lives and the lives of their families.  Trump was so <em>vilified</em> this election that there are people that truly, honestly believe he&#39;s the next Hitler. He&#39;s already said he wants to &quot;round up&quot; illegal immigrants and deport them; that sounds like a good idea on paper but that imagery in practice is a bit terrifying. And then who else is he going to &quot;round up&quot;? He&#39;s fearful of Arabs, he&#39;s said that Latinos and Blacks fill up our prisons because &quot;they just commit more crimes&quot; than whites, he&#39;s been hard on the LGBT community.  All those people are legitimately scared that they will be targeted by the Trump regime. One of his first 100-day measures is the &quot;Restoring Community Safety Act&quot; which will create a group called the &quot;Task Force On Violent Crime&quot;.  What that smells like is he&#39;s creating his own personal police force that&#39;s above the law. After the election the largest for-profit prison company (Corrections Corp) saw it&#39;s stock rise <strong>49%</strong>.   </p>

<p>The adds up to the idea that Trump will round up everyone who&#39;s not a white heterosexual Christian with his personal police force and throw them in prisons where they are forced to work for little or no pay. That&#39;s why people are scared.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The truth is the only reason this would even be possible is because our last two presidents basically stripped us of our rights through the threat of terrorism. And I mean ALL of us, gay straight black white whatever. And a lot of people see this as the real issue of the election, while all the SJW issues were more likely diversions.</p>

<p>A lot of people believe the exact opposite to be true of Trump. They think he has seen the citizens (once again, ALL of us) being taken advantage of and he believes it to be wrong.</p>

<p>Now which of us is right? No one knows yet. But at least half of this country has faith that he will start restoring the rights to ALL citizens, while at the same time they are being called racist and bigoted baselessly. </p>

<p>Most people don&#39;t want anyone to ever be victim to any -ism. Most people are genuinely good and care about people. </p>

<p>Unfortunately MSM hasn&#39;t been portraying this truth and instead broadcasted fear into the heats of millions having them believe that half of our society was voting for hatred, when in reality they were voting for the rights of ALL.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No... Him appointing a climate change denier to lead the EPA is catastrophically bad. His insistence on returning to coal power is catastrophically bad. His belief that climate change is a Chinese hoax is catastrophic. There&#39;s no other way to put it and there&#39;s zero purely economic reason not to transition to renewable forms of energy but that&#39;s even further exacerbated by the fact that the alternative isn&#39;t just more expensive it legitimately threatens our way of life and potentially our existence.</p>

<p>Even if you don&#39;t believe climate change could be so catastrophic, you should believe how different our way of life will have to be when we run out of oil. Think of all the plastics we use in our day to day lives derived from oil and realize that we&#39;ll have to find various substitutes. A transition to renewable energy should have began about 10 years ago but now it&#39;s quickly become urgently necessary.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Dude the fact is this country is less sexist and racist than the media narrative suggests. </p>

<p>And I think we can both agree that being called something you&#39;re not just because of your race or sex hurts (IE all blacks are xyz, all white males are racist).</p>

<p>The truth about trump supporters is that most have felt their freedoms being stripped throughout the past few decades. Most aren&#39;t fighting against equality, but instead are fighting against elites stripping them of their rights and telling them how to live.</p>

<p>Us white &#39;hicks&#39; just want to live our lives without being bothered and we want the same for all citizens. </p>

<p>We just want freedom and want to stop being told what to do and think based on the faults of others (IE gun control, or being called racist just because we are white).</p>

<p>We need to stop tying to bring everyone down to the same level while the elites laugh at us for throwing away our rights, and start trying to lift everyone up to the same level of freedom so we can all live the lives we believe are right.</p>

<p>Take gun control for instance. Instead of limiting the right to own guns, wouldn&#39;t it be better to lift up our sisters and brothers throughout our society who may be dealing with some mental health issues in order to make our country safer without taking away basic human rights.</p>

<p>Sorry for the rant, but I think Trump supporters and Hillary supporters are equally looking for self preservation, but we are being pitted against each other with hate instead of really trying to come together and solve our problems.</p>

For many Americans the fact that someone who announced his candidacy by calling Mexican immigrants rapists, criminals, etc and has called for a ban on Muslim immigration has actually won a nationwide election is very alarming. It signals that it&#39;s okay to be openly racist to each other because suddenly you feel justified in your racism. There&#39;s definitely a certain level of racism that is normal and nationalism that is healthy but historically speaking it&#39;s usually countries that take these things too far that really freak out as we struggle to wrap our heads around their atrocities.</p>

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abwc7AAXn3A">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abwc7AAXn3A</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Not all of the people who voted for Trump are bigots, but all of the bigots did vote for Trump.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As clearly idiotic as it is to block freeways and set shit on fire in Oakland (you&#39;re hurting your comrades, aren&#39;t you?), but these people are protesting to make sure that there&#39;s a counter-voice to show the bigoted Trump voters that not everyone thinks like they do.</p>

Society needs to show the KKK, rapists, homophobes, etc, that we do not support those ideas and they need to go back under their rock, because there will be consequences to dragging their antisocial instincts back into the light after we worked so hard to get rid of them.  Trump as an individual may only be a single narcissist conman in a single branch of a beautifully constructed government, but his election makes the deplorables think they are the majority.  People conveniently forget Hillary won the popular vote.  Trump does NOT have a mandate, and his inflammatory rhetoric does NOT represent the spirit of America.</p>

<p>There are plenty of things the USA does wrong, but putting Trump in charge of the patriot act, the IRS, and the EPA is just the door opening to God knows what.  So.  There is good reason that we can protest BEFORE the fact for once.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>All the people protesting Trump, spent zero time reading the Wikileaks releases. If those same people studied, they would have realized the whole thing was a shame and Trump was the only option. I despise Trump from his policy issues, but I think most of those were to get votes. He&#39;s really a mystery how he&#39;ll lead. His environmental issues are scary. I was really hoping we&#39;d move past the abortion thing, hopefully that was just too get the Evangelicals, as i don&#39;t think he cares (he&#39;s probably paid for one or two).  I&#39;d like him to throw Hillary in jail, clean the swamp. That&#39;s why I voted for him, but he&#39;s miles from perfect and Bernie would have had my view. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, and I can understand it being a flashpoint for people who <em>do</em> want to protest bigger issues and are simply being inaccurately portrayed by the media as being merely upset Hillary supporters. I think there&#39;s both going on. </p>

<p>All I know is, there&#39;s a lot of emotional upset right now, and I think people just need to wait and see how this plays out instead of feeding the fire in any one direction.  This isn&#39;t the right protest for the right reasons, and the elite will play off that. Just keep doing you, don&#39;t react to the narrative or counter-narrative. Reacting is how you get sucked in. I don&#39;t mean to preach, but this is just becoming clear to me, that our attention and reactions are a limited resource that we have to use carefully, and many protesters are focused on who the president is instead of the deeper systemic issues in both parties that have been causing America&#39;s decline for 40 years now. If this protest develops a tone of speaking to deeper issues, then I&#39;m all ears. If it&#39;s just crying because Democrats didn&#39;t get their demagogue, then I don&#39;t care. </p>

<p>It&#39;s within Russia&#39;s existing business interests to endorse Trump. And if it means us not creating more of a mess in the Midd East I&#39;m okay with it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>All of that is too abstract and difficult for the average person to deal with. Even if they accept it as true, to simply make it out of their beds and subserviate themselves daily, they must wash it from their mind. This isn&#39;t because they&#39;re ignorant or crazy but because their survival has been tied to a crazy system that demands their ignorance. Those who admit that reality is real are punished through alienation. When a human is given the option between telling the truth or feeding themselves and their children, it is hardly a shock which option they choose.</p>

<p>Trump gives them a socially acceptable outlet for rage and protest. They know, viscerally, how fucked everything is. There is a silent awareness of the lurking evil they are complicit in. Now they have been given an opportunity to join those of us who have sacrificed ourselves on the alter of truth rather then the alter of corporate greed, and they are seizing that opportunity. </p>

<p>This is a win. We should not reject their struggle. Better to be thankful that the spirit of protest is not dead and join them on the streets. </p>

<p>Voting has become a case of &quot;right&quot; or &quot;wrong&quot; - not &quot;vote for what you prefer&quot;.</p>

<p>This is why the polls are so off.  People who support the &quot;wrong&quot; side won&#39;t admit to it because the hassle and vitriol it would receive just isn&#39;t worth it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Last night&#39;s protests in Seattle were ironic to me:  On December 12, 2000, when the Supreme Court stopped the Florida vote count and awarded Bush the presidency, I went to the Seattle Federal Building in the rain.  I expected to join a protest.</p>

<p>I was the only person in Seattle who was there.</p>

<p>I went the next night, and there were no protests then, either.</p>

<p>I&#39;m sure that if Hillary had won, Republicans would be burning cities and claiming it was stolen.  Maybe they&#39;d be right, maybe not.  The system is opaque and trust is broken.</p>

<p>When the Supreme Court steals an election, that&#39;s a whole new level of corruption.  But nobody blinked in 2000.  Then we all got burned.</p>

<p><strong>Both Republicans &amp; Democrats have legitimate complaints of voting irregularities &amp; electoral fraud in this 2016 election, including voting machines flipping votes &amp; elected officials stripping millions from voter rolls.</strong></p>

<p>But we are not listening to each other.  &quot;CTR&quot; is the new &quot;commie&quot;/&quot;racist&quot;/&quot;sexist&quot; smear intended to silence dissent.  Divide &amp; conquer is injected into the crowd.</p>

<p>And so the tree falls.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh, I&#39;m not trying to get Trump not to be president.  What I want now is that the Democrats take a page from the Republican playbook and stop the government from functioning for four years.  Screw &quot;coming together&quot;, &quot;give him a chance&quot;, blah blah.  Anyone remember this?:

Now is the time.  I am sick of Democrats putting the country back on track and taking the high road.  I want them to unanimously vote no on every single Republican idea/fart that comes at them for the next four years.  I don&#39;t care if Republicans want to give every orphan a million dollars in gold - NO, a liberal supreme court justice - NO, stronger regulations AGAINST off shore money - NO...  After 8 years of Republican dog-in-the-manger, it&#39;s time to turn the tables.</p>

<p>For something that is&#39;nt real, it sure is effective, isn&#39;t it? I think what you&#39;re really getting at by saying &quot;Nationality is just a social construct&quot; is that Nationality and Patriotism are just ideologies - which I would agree with. But ideologies are very real, effective, and dangerous.</p>
