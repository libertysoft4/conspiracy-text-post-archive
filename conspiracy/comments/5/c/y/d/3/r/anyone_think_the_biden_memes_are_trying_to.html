    <div class="md"><p>Oh they&#39;ve been covertly doing it since the beginning but now they get the idiot public to beg for it and congratulate one another.  Just as I see this blocking fake news for the &quot;greater good&quot; tyranny aka public benefit as poorly concealed censorship.  Yet Reddit main is applauding with fervor and down voting and viciously denouncing anyone who questions how this can be abused.  Hell Reuters even called out CNN for a recent lie about Trump... another lie among millions these last decades and yet they are &quot;legit&quot; while no doubt Breitbert and Daily Mail will get black listed. Sure the latter especially has some odd stuff sometimes but they also have broken things none in MSM would even acknowledge until forced to do so and only then because these &quot;non legit&quot; sites made us aware.  Like that poor girl and her family kidnapped by a hospital and CPS.</p>

<p>It&#39;s being said it&#39;s just for the click bait crap and scam sites like see which celebrities aged horribly and some photo of Julia Roberts and some woman who barely resembles in her 90s with some kind of drug problem.  But it&#39;s the same crap... camel nose in the tent. Pretty soon tent is destroyed and you are outside shivering in the desert night... or trampled.</p>

<p>Social Security cards were just a temporary thing and would never be used as IDs.  Income tax was just an emergency patriotic support of freedom during war time they would roll them back after. Etc etc</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I especially like the ones with both Obama and Biden in them,  such great chums.   Except that you never see Obama&#39;s daughters anywhere near Biden.   Obama is smart enough,  or his daughters are smart enough,  or Michelle set down the law,  so Biden can&#39;t get his creeps off on those two.</p>

<p>The other thing this shows is just how able Obama is to compartmentalize and compromise with drone bombing kids,  implementing a police state,  etc.    Its like he is totally ok with the Hillary agenda/corruption/treason,   to the point he went out and campaigned for her.    What a shame,  and then Chappelle and others calling Obama a great president because of what again?    Because he is &quot;chill&quot; and broke the color barrier.   No,  sorry,  but that does not give Obama a pass.   Any more than memes give Biden a pass.    By the way,    look where Biden&#39;s son happens to be,  in the Ukraine,  helping to install neo-Nazi&#39;s to pillage the wealth for American corporate masters.</p>

<p>Some republicans are globalists,  and some are not.    Obama was deeply against Brexit,  Trump was deeply for it.</p>

<p>Remember,  George Bush Sr.  voted for Hillary.   That means he also largely approved of what Obama did.   And why not,  Obama supported the war on terror,   fracking,  etc.    Still,  republicans would rather see a Bush in the white house over a Clinton or an Obama.    Its mafia politics,  there are factions even among the republicans.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Was MLK regarded as &quot;rowdy&quot;?    Yeah,   people are wary of blacks,  but we will never know what good our first black president could have pulled off.    Because Obama was ineffective at doing anything well except bullshitting,  and being chill.   He was probably the last great master of the liberal con job.   No one else will be able to follow that,  the liberals are dead,  officially.   Unofficially they have been dead since the 60&#39;s.    Imitation republicans.

    <div class="md"><p>Yes,  MLK was not compliant,  he did try to disrupt the &quot;order&quot; of the corrupt establishment,  and paid with his life.  </p>

<p>Obama had pretended that he was going to pick up where MLK had been stopped.</p>

<p>That pretend was a fraud.   For 8 years we have endured that fraud in the White House,  and the Libyans and Syrians have endured far worse than we have.     Strange if Trump gets away with ending the foreign aggressions,  but Obama would have been killed if he had tried to.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t think Obama should be compared with MLK except in contrast,  because Obama relished his role as murderer in chief too much.    He wasn&#39;t a reluctant participant in any of the crimes as far as I can tell.    Even lots of black people now view Obama as a willing and eager tool of white oppression.    I too wanted to believe,  but my eyes are clear now.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t like or trust Trump,  but the election process has done a good job of exposing the character of so many aspects of our government,  media,  political parties,  and specific individual players.   Eyes are being forced open.   Hopefully real investigations will ensue.   And real prosecutions of the guilty.    There is a lot more truth that has yet to be dealt with or even yet to come out.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, it seems we&#39;re on the same page since we don&#39;t trust these administrations and presidents. The idea is that the deep state (CIA, NSA, military-industrial complex, Israeli influence, etc) is making too much money off wars in the middle east to ever end it. Obama promised to pull out of Iraq and Afghanistan 8 years ago, and now what? Now the US is still in both countries, fighting the same wars, and potentially entering more wars in the future. The pre-designed plans of the elite are going to go on no matter what shill/man-in-the-middle they&#39;ve got in the W.H.</p>

<p>Either way I remain optimistic for the future. Maybe Trump will curb military power over seas (just like the last 16 or so presidents promised to do).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Tell that to Afghanistan,  Iraq,  Libya,  Syria,  Lebanon,  Ukraine.    They have been battlegrounds.    Its not your typical world war,  but its not minor either,   and many other countries have been involved including the US,  Russia, Canada,  Australia,  Japan,  France,  Germany,  China,  Pakistan,  Saudi,  Yemen,  Egypt,  and the list goes on an on,  since 2003 to now.    The positioning of the nuclear powers in these regards are especially troubling.    But if you just look at the volume and power of the bombs dropped,   it is amazing,  it rivals WWII.   And economies all over the world have been rigged,   propped up,  and yet still decimated.    Unemployment is much higher than stated in the EU and the US,  and is very,  very high in China,  in the hundreds of millions.    The world is reeling,  but you wouldn&#39;t know it looking at the news.</p>

<p>but yes these obama-biden memes come as a petty counterattack that just reminds people of how disgusting pizzagate is.   &quot;Obama ordering 65k for hotdogs and pizza from chicago&quot;.  scary shit if you really think about it.  not just an oligarchy, but a satanic pedophile cult oligarchy!  </p>

<p>Depressing as shit, to think that the candidate I voted for twice has rape/killed children for satanic cult purposes.  Even if it&#39;s just an &quot;elite&quot; club, it&#39;s still dark and fucking stupid.

Never heard that before, just wondering what you base that on? What is the connection with pizza gate? Even Biden I&#39;ve never heard of him being involved, just Hillary and her DNC goons. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;I think Obama spent about $65,000 of the tax-payers money flying in
pizza/dogs from Chicago for a private party at the White House not long
ago, assume we are using the same channels? &quot;</p>

<p>&quot;If we get the same &quot;waitresses,&quot; I&#39;m all for it!!!&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>:-/</p>

<p>I want to believe Obama isn&#39;t involved, but he had a fundraiser at Comet Ping Pong.</p>

<p>edit:  Biden just has that grope-y cspan video with children that was pretty disturbing.  And the weird &quot;friendship&quot; bracelet with a weirder <em>pizza</em> charm on it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Biden once cut me up in traffic. I was driving along the I-495 minding my own business when this black car swerved in front of my lane without putting their blinkers on. I know it was Biden because the licence plate read DZ 1534, the 34 clearly meaning Biden (B+I+D+E+N = 2+9+4+5+14 = 34). It was an asian lady, but everyone knows that the white house has shape-shifting technology implanted in all their operatives to let them go incognito so they can say racist words at Trump rallies. Anyway, what I was getting at is Biden inconvenienced me almost as much as the genital sores I got from your mom.</p>
