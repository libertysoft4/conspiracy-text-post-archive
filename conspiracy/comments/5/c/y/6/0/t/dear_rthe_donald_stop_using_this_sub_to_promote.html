    <div class="md"><p>Honestly I never understood the Trump love around here beyond his support for Alex Jones. He&#39;s been a member of the elite his entire life, has friends in shady places, has a primary interest in increasing his fortune and popularity, and is looking to fill his cabinet with Bush-era establishment guys. </p>

<p>I believe Clinton is corrupt too, but the major difference I&#39;ve seen between him and Clinton this election is that we&#39;ve barely seen ANYTHING about Trump&#39;s behind-the-scenes dealings. We&#39;ve been fortunate enough to explore massive investigations against Clinton, look at her and her foundation&#39;s financial records, see thousands of leaked and released emails, but we can&#39;t even see Trump&#39;s tax returns. I really don&#39;t like that there&#39;s some kind of assumption he&#39;s clean when he should be an obviously shady character and we know little beyond what he tells us. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>What America needs is someone to go in and clean up the military industrial complex, the privatized prison systems and legalize marijuana.</p>

<p>Once we stop crippling our economy by going to war and locking our citizens up for profit using tax dollars and instead start receiving sales tax for the marijuana that&#39;s currently being sold illegally - true change will become possible. </p>

<p>Political corruption, our prison population, federal income taxes - all cut down</p>

<p>Citizens would be able to live their lives free of being imprisoned for smoking a little reefer. </p>

<p>Jobs? Plenty. The privatized prison systems are largely fronts for legalized slavery. You see once you are sentenced, you lose all of your rights and become property of the state to use for manufacturing. That&#39;s where all of our jobs went. Not Mexico (who&#39;s cartels are now financially weakened due to the legalization as well).</p>

<p>Our schools and prison systems are fundamentally flawed. We &quot;teach&quot; children by spouting information at them without teaching them how to find it on their own - how to fact-check it for validity. We use our &quot;correctional facilities&quot; simply as a means to punish people without putting any thought into actually helping them become a better citizen.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve yet to hear any candidate mention or acknowledge these problems let alone run a campaign on them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>People can&#39;t &quot;find&quot; jobs because half the country is dumb enough to vote for Trump. We need to educate people on how to start a business or at least tell them to go into a profession with a demand. My college program has had a 100% pre-graduation job placement rating for like 10 years running (meaning every student to graduate with that degree accepted jobs prior to graduating) and myself along with 2 of my highschool buddies all went through it and now have lucrative careers while I see other friends who wasted free rides on parties and unmarketable degrees.</p>

<p>People need to accept that the future is in education and IT. Not manual labor that can be cheaply outsourced. </p>

<p>Either that or embrace the fact that we are the world&#39;s mob and up the extortion. I&#39;m down with whatever, just vote for me. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, You are an agent. Tell me how come Trump message or propaganda prevailed , opposed to Hilary&#39;s ?  What was the tipping point .. Was it FBIAnon post on 4chan , or was it that Hillary was out of touch and more corrupted ?

    <div class="md"><p>Trumps &quot;message&quot; prevailed because it was all-encompassing, had sophisticated brainwashing techniques and was targeted at America&#39;s most gullible political party (almost entirely christian hence the fake pope articles, antichrist messages, anti muslim sentiments etc). They told people that if they didn&#39;t vote they would be personally accountable to god for every abortion that takes place post-election. They told people that Soros/the DNC control the government and Trump is their only hope at a fair democracy. They told people that Clinton was paying people to beat up Trump supporters. They told people BLM was run by Soros. They told people the MSM is biased and to only come to them for information. Need I go on? He ran an excellent campaign and as a businessman I tip my hat to him but he&#39;s still not my president. I&#39;d like to think that conspiracy theorists weren&#39;t the target/aren&#39;t republican and he was merely exploiting the addictiveness of a good theory, however, I&#39;m beginning to have doubts.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not an agent. In truth I&#39;m a pissed off ~25 year old white guy who has been dating an undocumented immigrant for the past 3 years and I&#39;m personally pissed off that he thinks he has the right to wrangle her up and deport her.</p>

<p>She comes from an area that&#39;s filled with violence/poverty and merely fled here to escape and now lives peacefully with me working over 40 hours a week and paying the same income and sales taxes as every other citizen.</p>

<p>I&#39;m able to separate myself from that and see that other citizens will suffer just as much from Trump&#39;s &quot;message&quot;. That&#39;s why you see people protesting in mass.</p>

<p>In general, the Republican platform runs off Christianity, the Military, Whites and the Rich while the Democratic platform runs off increasing civil rights for all citizens.</p>

<p>As Obama was taking office he was subjected to being called a Muslim terrorist and was basically forced to show his birth certificate to the public. People were/still are so racist that they can&#39;t help but distrust a black man. Almost every white person I knew - family, friends&#39; families called him a nigger and talked about how he was going to ruin the country (coming out of being economically depressed from the Bush administration). For the past 8 years he has turned this country around. We are (almost) completely recovered and things seem to have been business as usual on the war front. Women saw lots of rights given to them. Black people felt accepted in society since they finally got one of their own in office (there was a huge racial divide). Gays were granted the right to marry. Immigrants were welcomed with open arms. Our suffering were given government assistance to get back on their feet. etc. It seemed the USA was truly the land of the free and a place I could call my home.</p>

<p>Then Trump came along with his civil rights stomping ass. The Democrats will never take a civil right away from anyone. The Republicans seem to want to oppress any non-white male (claim the bible for why women should have less pay, rights, etc). People seemed to have forgotten America&#39;s ugly domestic past. While I was off having fun with my new black, hispanic and gay friends a dark faction of citizens were apparently stewing in their bunkers pissed off at how the world has gone to shit.</p>

Look into Josip Broz Tito (who was our &#39;marchall&#39; and a socialist dictator) and look into the making of Non-Aligned Movement. I&#39;m 43yr white male. When I was born , our country experienced major economic boost , coming from a int.loan , but economy was so blooming it was easily payed off. There are some analysis that citizens of Yugoslavia actually felt and made up to 50% more money / consumer power (?) in the small period of 2 years. At that time 1973 - 75,6 . Now comes 1980 and our beloved dictator dies of old age (had a one of the largest funerals in history - by foreign delegation attendance, look it up, too). It took about 10 years for shit to hits the fan and nationalism to start blooming (YU consisted of 6 republics and about 8 major nations: Slovenians, Croats, Muslims, Serbs, Macedonians, Montenegrians, Kosovo-albanians, and some Hungarians) I&#39;m a minor minority nation, too.</p>

<p>So, with incentives from Western Europe (EU Union in forming) and NATO in forming, Slovenia and Croatia decides to secede. All hell breaks loose, &#39;cause Croatia had about 15% of Serbs living in it, they wanted to keep living in Yugoslavia. Also , they remembered 2nd WW , when Croats had a strong fascist movement of Ustasha. 
Western world allies Croatia to secede , war starts, first Croatia, then Bosnia, then Kosovo. Serbia are bad guys , all the time. 
In retrospective, the reason for this was always the way of independence and non-aligment being rooted very strong in Serbia.</p>

<p>Basically , western europe, USA, and NATO helped very much for a country of 20 million same language speaking , with strong independence movement, strong economy and strong army, to fall apart to 7 small , nationalistic countries.</p>

<p>In comes EU and USA to buy all the good industrial resources, and make us work like slaves for a small vage for them. Divide &amp; rule. 
My country - Serbia was made to look like it&#39;s full of villains (look up some holiwood movies) , savages and nationalistic retards. 
And it was made to look like that - by American Democrats. 
When in fact, the only countries that were accepted into EU were Slovenia and Croatia, countries that are almost purely ethnically clean. (Look up Croatia - operation Storm / Oluja , which made almost all Serbs to flee to Serbia , 10% of Croatia population) Oh, that made with a help of NATO and USA liberals. </p>

<p>Soros all the way involved in &#39;making of these civil societies&#39;. Fact. 
Comes a 1999 and a Kosovo problem , long in waiting, since Serbs and Kosovars had their share of disputes. Again, with the incentives from the West, Kosovo demands indipendence (how lucky for USA that it has some major mining grounds and resources to serve in next 50 years). Liberal politics from USA. </p>

<p>And here comes the first european bombing of independant country since the 2ndWW.  That bombing of Serbia could&#39;ve easily instigated 3rdWW if the Russia was strong as it is now. Luckily for Serbia (which is to &#39;blame&#39; for all wars ever (look up &#39;Gavrilo Princip&#39;)) , it did not grow into major world conflict. 
Kosovo albanians payed of their debt to western world by being a major drug trafficing country, and with an illegal trade of people and organs (look-up &#39;Organ theft in Kosovo , Yellow house&#39;) </p>

<p>Comes 2000, and we were overthrowing our &#39;dictator&#39; Milosevic (who , by the way , wasn&#39;t at all nationalist, but more of a socialist with a strong non-nationalistic view for Serbia) , and happily run into this &#39;Brave new world&#39; of freedom and democracy.</p>

<p>So, 16 years later, we are still waiting to be accepted to European Union, still getting lectured of democracy, still being called savages (by England and USA, most prominently) , and with having now a gullible , easily manipulated (from West) goverment. Still waiting for a better pay , better life, better day. I am a minor minority in Serbia, never had a single nationalistic problem in life, live in a city that has the most variants of religions and churches, probably in the whole eastern europe (see &#39;Novi Sad&#39; it&#39;s a beautiful city - chosen to be Cultural capital of Europe for 2020.) , still waiting to not be called &#39;savage&#39; by the western societies.
Here is an example of a City sign in my neighbour, written in six languages ... it was always like this here where I live. <a href="http://www.alo.rs/resources/images/0000/021/594/zrenjanin_1000x0.jpg">http://www.alo.rs/resources/images/0000/021/594/zrenjanin_1000x0.jpg</a>
Savage , isn&#39;t it ?</p>

<p>I&#39;m seeing a major influx of Syrian , Iraq, Afganistan refugess , passing through my country and city , going to EU to seek a better life. Every day. Croatia and Hungary (both part of EU) had built their walls already, they did not need Trump for that.</p>

<p>So, all I can think when looking at american liberals protest against Trump is this: even though your purpose and goal is credible and worth fighting for, you people live in the bubble and not seeing that Democrats and liberals with a MAJOR HELP of Soros and so called &#39;open societies&#39; are actually blackmailing and destroing countries , inventing wars to sell arms and take resources.
And your protests against Trump are used, organized, or helped by some major villains, as seen throughout the world. Well, if you don&#39;t chill and learn about what&#39;s going on, you will now see the same shit that I in the Serbia, some dude in Iraq, Libya, Sirya , and Ukraine were seeing all these years.  Maybe it&#39;s for the best. Maybe you need a rude awakening. </p>

<p>Russia isn&#39;t the good guy or the bad guy since countries aren&#39;t human beings and therefore can&#39;t be good guys or bad guys,  they can do good or bad things from certain perspectives but that&#39;s really depending on what country you live and it&#39;s relationship with Russia. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ok, but at the height of the cold war both the USA and USSR were doing equally corrupt shit. At the very least both nations are equally corrupt. Why is it though that americans have such a hateboner for russia/putin when their own government does the same thing, and worse than russia now?</p>

<p>Unlike the president of the united states, putin is firmly in charge. At least you know who is pulling the strings and how the power structure is aligned. With the USA there&#39;s a shadow government controlled by massive monetary interests from around the world. They abuse the USA&#39;s power for their wealth whereas Putin enriches himself. The corruption in Russia is much more open  and authoritarian rather than the subversive manipulation in the USA that makes people think their country isn&#39;t a fucking monstrosity.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Eh, I feel it should just be assumed that the POTUS is going to subjected to corruption and extortion since it essentially comes with the job. The ridiculous idea that he would even be able to come in and sweep out corruption without immediately being assassinated is preposterous and needs to just be thrown out the window.</p>

<p>This leaves three options: he&#39;s already corrupt, he will be corrupted, or he&#39;s not going to survive to see anything come to fruition.</p>

<p>Given that he is fully saying that he wants to go in and flush out &quot;the swamp&quot; (corrupt democrats), I&#39;m left with the options that the government&#39;s corruption isn&#39;t really an issue (not likely), Trump want&#39;s to go in and be the Republican&#39;s Soros (what I&#39;m guessing), Trump is dumb enough to think he can sweep out a shadow government (I don&#39;t think he&#39;s that dumb) or he is willing to sacrifice himself for &quot;the truth&quot; (possible but I doubt it).</p>

<p>Judging by his familiarity with MoveOn, Soros, Wikileaks, etc. I assume he&#39;s just been playing the jester in order to further the police state agenda for the NWO or whoever and drawing attention to Soros in order to take over his position or as a scapegoat for simple military industrial complex/privatized prison/etc money. </p>

<p>My best guess is the last, he&#39;s using Soros (a known conspiracy theory target and someone with relatively low wealth and life expectancy) as a scapegoat for his election and his plans are to exploit his position to further his family&#39;s wealth and power.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re assuming there&#39;s only one controlling monetary interest in congress. It&#39;s not centralized corruption or control, it&#39;s just the invisible hand of a broken power structure controlled by overall greed not a single entity. A nudge in the right direction (trump&#39;s plan) won&#39;t fix it but it will reduce the weight that hand has on policy.</p>

<p>If you think there&#39;s some sort of evil cabal that controls every move and policy you&#39;re a fucking moron plain and simple.</p>

<p>I look at it like this: I&#39;m the president and the nation wants gun control - the NRA is offering me a 200k bribe and the anti-gun lobby is offering me 100k - I&#39;m obviously taking the NRA&#39;s offer and keeping that relationship alive.</p>

<p>Then just apply that to every issue and every politician and that&#39;s how the &quot;shadow government&quot; operates. George Soros would just be a major player with a lot of interests.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah and Trump&#39;s policies will help alleviate that. There will be a revolving door of corruption as we vote out the congress people who vote against our interest but at least if you&#39;re voted out you now have some employment/lobbying restrictions and thus the bribes will be more costly.</p>

<p>Babysteps to get money out of politics. </p>

<p>Personally I think we should an avenue of legally pursuing death penalties for corrupt congressmen instead of just voting them out. Either that or direct democracy/meritocracy is the only way we curb corruption to a manageable level</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There was a time about 15 years ago that I thought Alex Jones was speaking truth to power. His appearance in the Richard Linklater film, Waking Life, was electrifying to hear as a 16 year old beginning to question the system. It was what first put him on my radar and I started listening to his radio program so after seeing the movie. This was around 2002-2003. For a while, he seemed like he was dead right about a ton of stuff - 9/11, Iraq, Bush war crimes, mass government surveillance, police militarization etc.  Sure he was bombastic and over the top sometimes but that&#39;s why I loved him. He was nothing if not passionate and I felt like his passion was well deserved and I wished more people got as fired up about the real things as he did. </p>

<p>Then...something changed. Admittedly, I stopped listening to him as much as I got busier with life post-college. Then I see him start popping up in random youtube videos here and there a few years ago and he just looks unhinged and almost like a caricature of his old self. It&#39;s hard to describe but it just looked staged or something. And now this election cycle I see that he&#39;s got all his weight behind Donald Trump?! This is the same guy that I used to hear losing his mind when George W. Bush talked about how much easier things would be if the US was a dictatorship? He&#39;s putting his support behind a guy who routinely praises strong men and has an Authoritarian bent like no one else we&#39;ve seen in recent history? It just doesn&#39;t gel with who he used to be and what he used to stand for. </p>

<p>I&#39;m left to come to one of two conclusions: 1) Alex Jones has officially lost his mind or 2) Alex Jones is being used as a puppet by the very people he used to warn all of us about. I am inclined to think it&#39;s #1. But #2 is also an intriguing option and not one I had never considered before. I remember even thinking during the early days about how much more on edge I was and angry I was and then hopeless I felt after listening to 3 hours of Alex rail on and on about how fucked we were getting by the Elites that I actually started to think &quot;what if Alex is just a stooge put here to fill us with terror and half truths and distractions?&quot; I dunno, it&#39;s like some one else said, it&#39;s almost like a conspiracy-ception! I dismissed the notion back then, and today I still feel like the simpler answer is probably true - after walking a razors edge for so long, he just ain&#39;t right in the head any more. </p>

<p>sorry for any typos, kind of rambled more than I thought I was going to when I started. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Holy shit, I didn&#39;t realize that was Alex Jones in Waking Life.</p>

<p>Actually kind of depressing now that I went back and watched it... Talking bout two sides of the same coin and how they give you a buffet of misinformation - now he runs infowars for the radical right. </p>

<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/5cq7t8/watch_fox_news_calls_out_george_soros_for_funding/d9zh56m/">I think I might have actually been the one to make the &quot;cospiracy-ception&quot; comment your referring to, lol.</a></p>

<p>There&#39;s definitely more than meets the eye with this one and I can&#39;t stop poking around. Now that I know Alex Jones&#39; past it definitely makes things more interesting and helps explain the Soros links.</p>

<p>My best guess off of the top of my head is that he&#39;s simply a puppet for Trump. That would explain him falling off of the radar, looking different, beginning new youtube channels, all that fucking money they apparently have (seriously, infowars is better filmed than MSM), and the overall craziness. He was either simply bought out by Trump and exploited to push his agenda as the white night for government corruption or the two of them are truly on a mission to rid corruption and are willing to lie their asses off for the greater good (but that sounds too much like the_donald so probably not).</p>

<p>I keep coming to the conclusion that Trump is plotting to simply make money off of the usual military industrial complex, privatized prison systems, pharmaceuticals, etc while destroying the legislature hindering his and his interests&#39; current operations and he&#39;s just exploiting the conspiracy theory/alex jones/, anti-MSM/fake news narratives to keep completely envelop his followers in these ideas that liberal (commies) are either batshit insane criminals, lazy idiot drug addicts or funded by Soros (explains why the_donald is so hysterically brainwashed and think you&#39;re a shill if you offer any debate).</p>

<p>Hell, InfoWars is basically training them how to talk over democrats/opposing views in all of their &quot;interview&quot; videos. </p>

<p>If you don&#39;t think Trump (or campaign managers) is that sophisticated take a look at this <a href="http://moneysexcharisma.com/how-to-humiliate-your-enemies-how-hillary-supporters-could-bury-trump/">http://moneysexcharisma.com/how-to-humiliate-your-enemies-how-hillary-supporters-could-bury-trump/</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve also been thinking about this a lot lately and in my opinion there&#39;s no one more angry about Trump winning than Alex Jones.  Jones planned on riding the whole &quot;it was rigged&quot; thing for another year after Trump lost, while still grilling &quot;President Hillary Clinton&quot; with all her baggage.  Jones&#39; whole shtick is going against whichever president is in office so seeing how weak of a candidate Trump was (although widely popular), Jones doubled down on Trump losing in order to play the rigged card.  This plan backfired when Trump won so now Jones has the choice of becoming a full blown right-wing personality, or slowly distancing himself from Trump and going back his old approach.  This explains why Jones was more left leaning when Bush was in office and then went right when Obama got in.  It almost like Glenn Beck and Alex Jones swapped bodies.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This was my comment a day ago when Alex Jones came up:
I mean, most of that shit comes from Alex Jones and personally think he is a plant of the CIA in counter intelligence (like Anderson Cooper). His role is to fill the airwaves with all sorts of crazy conspiracy bullshit (like lizard people) and put out factual stuff. He is poisoning the well of information. By putting out factual stuff and then tying it to the really crazy shit, no one will actually take any of it seriously, and those that will are off their rocker (thinking the world&#39;s government are full of lizards who are trying to raise the global CO2 temperatures so they can have a more habitable environment to live in).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Most conspiracies are actually based on the assumptions that those in power collude and conspire to keep their power, control, wealth...and to expand it further.</p>

<p>I actually have trouble believing that &quot;some shadowy figures&quot; as you called them (the wealthy elite) , had no hand in his rise and didn&#39;t help, promote, support and finance him.
Especially when you understand how powerful the media is in controlling the mass consciousness (and how much of the media is already controlled).</p>

<p>This is the enormous difference between &quot;conspiracy theorists&quot; and other people - we think many (not all)  things that promote and give further power and control to the wealthy elite are there by design, since the elite, though sociopaths they may be,  are very intelligent and indeed far from fools - but you think that these things and events are there by mere chance, which I just cannot bring myself to believe.  </p>

<p>I think it might be a little bit more than that, though.  I feel like when people listen to Alex Jones spitting all over the mic, they think, &quot;Wow, this guy is really fighting for me, I guess I can keep going to my 9-5 job and drink myself to sleep every night.  No need to protest, this guy has it covered.&quot;</p>

<p>It&#39;s like they&#39;re fulfilling their urges to do something by just listening to a guy lose his shit over it.  Very similarly to the way that people will like a cause on Facebook, and then consider that their public service for the year.  Giving yourself the illusion of giving a damn.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yea, same thing happens with TV too. Some people watch some evil doer get his in a TV show/movie and it gives them that release of brain chemicals that makes them feel good kind of like how games supplement real accomplishments the same way and porn does the same thing with sex.</p>

<p>Except since it isn&#39;t the real thing it&#39;s a fleeting feeling and it makes people go back to it more often instead of looking for real tangible things to do that will actually give them a long lasting sense of accomplishment and purpose in life. Our brains are wired to go for the easy/fast way. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Agreed. Thing I hate about Alex is that yes, he dives into some theories and gets tot he bottom, but then he goes off on a crazy rant about fish controlling the ocean water or something. </p>

<p>He is controlled opposition. He will give you just enough then stop and say something totally bat shit crazy that discredits himself. Kind of reminds me of old Glenn beck. He was on to some stuff then went off the deep end. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Completely agreed.  I used to watch Alex Jones back in the 2000s and while I occasionally could tellhe was going way too far out on a limb, I at least thought he was trying to fight the good fight even if he was occasionally(often?) misinformed.</p>

<p>Now?  Eh. At best he&#39;s a peddler of goods who uses fear mongering to increase his sales.</p>

<p>If Alex Jones was who he presents himself to be, going after people as powerful as he presents them to be..  why has he not died of a heart attack or suspicious robbery or something by now? </p>

<p>Nobody&#39;s squeaky clean. Nobody, but especially not a billionaire real estate mogul. This means Trump is better at hiding the skeletons in his closet than Clinton. <em>That&#39;s</em> a scary thought. Whether it&#39;s the friends he&#39;s made, the backroom deals he&#39;s brokering, or whatever, Trump has the power to be a sleazy cheating fuck <em>and make it vanish</em>. Like, Russian hackers are leaking Clinton&#39;s every email in the last decade and yet nothing turns up on Trump? He opens casinos and develops real estate around the world without a single government pay off or deal brokered with organized crime? Nah, there&#39;s something weird as fuck going on there.</p>

I spent a lot of time on r/politics (I&#39;m sure some people looking at my history would say I&#39;m a shill), and there were actually a ton of conspiracies posted there, and also a ton of facts that people seem to just ignore about him. If you ask me, the media might hate Trump, but they focused on Hillary&#39;s emails the whole election and never pushed any of the shit he did in the past, so he got a huge pass that probably won him the election</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s cause he throws so much crap onto the floor it&#39;s hard for the main stream to pick thru and find something legitimate. Everyone is so worried to report on something that could be perceived as wrong that they wait for the next guy to verify it. But by the time anything is moved on that story, trump has already said something silly at a rally and it&#39;s time to cover that. </p>

<p>In a way the pussy grab video kind of helped trump. It dominated the news cycle for so long and had no impact on his base/followers. By the time the media got over that it was too close to the election for anyone to do any real searching for anything else. </p>

<p>I&#39;m sorry but the whole Russian/trump connection did not get as much searching as it deserved. The media just basically asked trump camp about it and then let it be. His ex campaign manager helped dictators for crying out loud and had more then just connections with Russia. </p>

<p>Trump just so happen to be the perfect candidate in the perfect media to fall into the White House. The media is a fucking circle jerk and each one is to afraid to let go of the next guy to do anything important. </p>

<p>The media made trump. They believed it was so in the bag for Clinton that they wanted a piece of the reality shit show that was trump. But instead of people tuning in to watch a meltdown they were tuning into a persecution of Clinton. The last month the only thing that was of substance was emails emails emails and trump driving it home and the media gave him free air time to spout whatever he wanted and make his own narrative. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Either that, or he just isn&#39;t as ballsy as Hillary was.
Hillary got caught because she had this highly complex <em>global network</em> of corrupt ties. She spread herself far too wide, and in the end it was too much to hide, too easy to break into. It collapsed under its own weight. 
I do think Trump has his own skeletons in the closet. I imagine he&#39;s got a knack for exploiting loopholes, so his sleazy behavior might not technically be illegal. I don&#39;t think his corruption is as far reaching as Hillary&#39;s though, and I don&#39;t think he&#39;s better at hiding them so much as they&#39;re easier to hide. </p>

<p>Then again I might be wrong, this election has made it pretty clear not to underestimate Trump. </p>

If you read through that, and still have questions that haven&#39;t been addressed, I&#39;m happy to continue the discussion.</p>

<p>I am about to go on a roughly three hour drive, so the conversation probably won&#39;t realistically continue until tomorrow, but I will respond.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Your argument was that someone needs to be there who knows what is going on. For this argument to be valid and Trump to still be considered &quot;anti-establishment&quot;, the whole cabinet cannot be an insider echo chamber. If he doesn&#39;t have reasonable representation from outside of establishment politics then he cannot claim to be anti-establishment. You also set up a straw man argument by listing people who have nothing at all to do with governing as the alternative. I think no matter what you think of him, Bernie Sanders can clearly be put up as a shining example of someone who knows what&#39;s going on in politics even though he is squarely anti-establishment, and there are many more like him. Ron Paul, if you want one from the other side of the aisle.</p>

<p>Pretty big assumption there, but, again, no. I am replying directly to the fact that your reply attempts to link justifiable skepticism with paranoia. The words you chose in the above quote (post-hyphen) are more direct and rational, but that is not what was stated in the comment that I replied to. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>The only person who is adhering to blind faith is you -- in the assumption that trump is evil.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Again, I have only made a comment about you linking paranoia to skepticism, especially when justified. There&#39;s no way you can know what I believe about Trump as I have never stated an opinion to that effect. This is just a poor attempt to redirect and obfuscate from the context of this thread. </p>

<p>It seems you are defensive and passionate right now. I speculate it is a normal reaction to the potential reality of a consequence of ego and governmental action. No worries, I get it...been there myself multiple times, and will be there again I&#39;m sure. Just try to recognize it and reply rationally to the context of the individual comment, not what you perceive as a <em>me vs. them</em> dialogue.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Cool - I think I hear what you&#39;re saying.</p>

<p>My issue is that <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-staff-factbox-idUSKBN13A04V?il=0">the people</a> he&#39;s <em>already</em> contacted give us a clear signal as to the direction of his administration.</p>

<p>Being considered for Secretary of Homeland Security is <strong>David A. Clarke</strong>, a notoriously pro-authoritarian sheriff <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/david-clarke-jail-death-terrill-thomas_us_57e03580e4b04a1497b5f12e">whose department is now under investigation after an inmate at the county jail died of profound dehydration.</a> It was later revealed that the water to his cell had been shut off. Inmates alleged that the water had been shut off <em>for six days</em> and that staff refused to give him water.</p>

<p>Being considered for Attorney General and/or Secretary of State is <strong>Rudy Giuliani</strong>, who comes from a Mafia family and who served as a career prosecutor, playing a key role in the sabotage of the investigations of the pedophile operations at the U.S. Military Academy. He was also involved in sabotaging the investigation of the Bank of Credit and Commerce International, the establishment-run bank where dictators, terror groups, cults and major drug and arms trafficking syndicates held accounts under the supervision of American and Israeli Intelligence. </p>

<p>Giuliani is of course best-known for serving as mayor of New York City from 1994 until December 2001, pushing through infamously authoritarian policies and legislation. The 9/11 attacks occurred during the final months of his term, <a href="https://www.corbettreport.com/911-suspects-rudy-giuliani/">and he oversaw the illegal destruction of large amounts of rubble in the days immediately following the attacks.</a> He also exhibited foreknowledge of the impending collapse of the towers <em>and</em> World Trade Center 7. He then played the early front runner for the GOP nomination in 2008.</p>

<p>Being considered for Secretary of the Treasury is <strong>Jamie Dimon</strong>, who is chairman, president and chief executive of J.P. Morgan Chase &amp; Company, co-founder and former president of Citigroup, and a former director of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. Dimon is a member of the Council on Foreign Relations and the Trilateral Commission.</p>

<p>Being considered for Secretary of Defense and/or National Security Advisor is <strong>Stephen Hadley</strong>, a self-professed neoconservative who was Deputy National Security Advisor from 2001-2005 and National Security Advisor from 2005-2009. Hadley was among the <em>&quot;Vulcans,&quot;</em> the six-man team of advisors assembled by Cheney to guide Bush. Hadley was formerly a principal at <strong>the Scowcroft Group</strong>, an international consulting firm founded by Brent Scowcroft - one of the &#39;wise men&#39; at the pinnacle of the U.S. establishment.</p>

<p>He <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20060405113721/http://www.mepc.org/journal_vol11/0406_lang.asp">shocked a group of Republican policymakers by suggesting, more than a year before 9/11, that removing Saddam Hussein from power was their &quot;number-one foreign-policy agenda.&quot;</a> Prior to the attacks, he was among the officials who consistently interered with attempts to arrest or kill Bin Laden.</p>

<p>Hadley, a member of the Council on Foreign Relations, presently sits on the board of defense contractor Raytheon, and is among its major stockholders. This did not stop CNN, NBC, FOX, Bloomberg TV and the Washington Post from giving him a platform to call for a U.S. missile attack on Syria following the staged chemical attacks in September 2013.</p>

<p>I think we need to begin organizing grassroots resistance against the globalist agenda, locally-oriented and action-based.

    <div class="md"><p>You have no understanding of the alt right or milo. I strongly encourage you to do some research before you blindly shoot your mouth off like this slandering people for no reason. Milo doesn&#39;t suppress gay people, in fact most of his speeches usually always involve him mentioning that he loves &quot;black cock&quot;. You probably saw he&#39;s against gay marriage and immediately went all liberal REEEEE. Just for your information, he&#39;s against gay marriage because he is against the religious institution of marriage in general...it has nothing to do with being gay. And that&#39;s an opinion that actually runs counter to most of the alt right as they are totally FOR marriage equality dumb dumb </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Bannon <strong>is</strong> establishment. He epitomizes the overlap between private financial interests and military intelligence.</p>

<p>He was born to a military family in Norfolk, Virginia, which has one of the largest naval presences in the U.S. </p>

<p>In 1976, he graduated from <strong>Virginia Tech</strong>, a major recruiting ground for the U.S. military, CIA and NASA, and the recipient of generous grants from DARPA for classified research. Why do you think there are so many mysterious murders and <em>&quot;people going postal&quot;</em> there? Why do you think Nidal Malik Hasan, the man allegedly responsible for the killings at Fort Hood, was trained there? </p>

<p>After his studies (or programming) at Virginia Tech, Bannon obtained a master&#39;s degree in <strong><em>national security studies</em></strong> from Georgetown, the prestigious Jesuit college in D.C. This school is largely viewed as a training ground for both the CIA and the State Department, and so based on the nature of his studies there it is highly-likely Bannon was receiving intelligence training.</p>

<p>He then graduated with honors from the elite Harvard Business School in 1983 and enlisted in the U.S. Navy. Serving as a Surface Warfare Officer in the Pacific Fleet, he would eventually become a special assistant to the Chief of Naval Operations. How many anti-establishment crusaders are in the employ of Naval Intelligence?</p>

<p>After his ostensible retirement from naval operations, Bannon found employment with Goldman Sachs. How many anti-establishment crusaders are in the employ of establishment-dominated global investment banks? </p>

<p>He eventually founded his own investment bank, Bannon &amp; Company, with several associates from Goldman Sachs, and negotiated the sale of Castle Rock Entertainment to establishment billionaire Ted Turner.</p>

<p>Don&#39;t you realize that the establishment and the intelligence services sponsor agents-of-influence in every part of the political spectrum? There are plenty of figures like Bannon on the <em>&quot;alternative right&quot;</em> and the <em>&quot;alternative left&quot;</em> whose purpose is manipulation.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>But why is it a problem suddenly now?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Because they couldn&#39;t see it until it was too late. </p>

<p>The way Trump&#39;s campaigners swarmed in, took over Reddit, botted the everliving fuck out of every the_donald post until everything <a href="/r/all/rising">/r/all/rising</a> was the_donald, co-opted Pepe, co-opted the memeverse, co-opted Sanders supporters after they got the shaft from Hillary, and managed to establish a personality cult around one of the most vile, filthy stereotypes of the 1% imaginable... that was something to behold.</p>

<p>And they&#39;re still at it. The phenomenon has now become self-sustaining.</p>

<p>&quot;Vote against Hillary&quot; said one side...</p>

<p>&quot;Vote against Trump&quot;, said the other....</p>

<p>And the divide and conquer two party &quot;lesser evil&quot;-tactics ensured another fucked up presidency with another fucked up financial elitist.</p>

<p>Obama would have never made it without him making peace with Wall Street. Sanders refused to do it, and the way he was sabotaged tells you all you need to know about him. The only sort of candidate you can trust is anti-Wall Street.</p>

<p>Cue the whinging about the liberty of the free market. Yeah, we&#39;ve seen that liberty at work the past 25 years after the Berlin Wall fell. Absolute fucking barrel-scraping, privatized, planet-destroying plutocrat pandemonium.</p>

<p>And you do what? Elect <em>Trump</em> to fix this?</p>

<p>I know why it was possible: because his fawning, memeing sycophants all over Reddit and the American electorate alike were swept along in Trump&#39;s complete epistemological nothingness: nothing is true today the way it was yesterday, and everything he does is evidence of the opposite. </p>

<p>Trump achieved the presidency by disturbing the very fabric of logic and truth to the point where the hapless electorate could no longer see him for what he was, and could only focus on the other side of  the establishment whorehouse.</p>

<p>There is no truth or insight possible into a man whose every malicious action can be explained away as evidence to the contrary by some elaborate scheme of collective cultist denial.</p>

<p>Well done Reddit.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Agreed. In fact, I believe that <strong>the collusion between (the criminally corrupt) Hillary Clinton, the DNC, the Washington elite (and the compromised DOJ in particular), the media and the polling organisations was the most pervasive and blatant State conspiracy of the modern age.</strong> </p>

<p>This Continuity of Government cabal manufactured and promoted a gigantic deception (that Hillary was a popular and viable presidential candidate) in order to steal the election, and they FAILED. </p>

<p>Billions of dollars were spent, thousands of lies were disseminated to promote the big lie, and millions of people were systematically brainwashed  into supporting a criminal for the highest office (not just in the US but around the world). </p>

<p>I am proud that <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> was at the forefront of exposing that corruption and waking people up to it.</p>

<p>Now that she has been dispatched, I hope, to the dustbin of history, Donald Trump&#39;s sins and misdemeanours will inevitably get more attention from us. I hope that all the Trump supporters who have found this subreddit in the last few months will stay with us and help to monitor the new president&#39;s actions and policies so he remains accountable to the people, and doesn&#39;t become corrupted by the Washington machine.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think the good thing about Trump is that, because <em>so</em> many people despise him, he might be more likely to be held accountable for his bad actions. I&#39;m pretty sure even a good chunk of the people who actually voted for him hate him. He&#39;s walking on thin ice so to speak, so he must tread carefully to avoid upsetting the American people.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, that&#39;s the ridiculously one-dimensional way of looking at it.</p>

<p>I&#39;d say the more reasonable conclusion is that those of us in agreement with the OP <em>never</em> supported him. We were in fact frustrated that this sleazy fascist creep - a friend of the Clintons (their daughters are friends too) - was receiving so much support from otherwise-informed people simply because he&#39;s been dressed differently. </p>

<p>He received the official endorsement of the Fraternal Order of Police and has openly stated his intentions to drastically expand the powers of law enforcement. He has also openly stated his plans to expand U.S. involvement in the wars in the Middle East, and not only endorsed the intelligence services&#39; right to employ torture but said their leeway should be expanded. </p>

<p>How is this man a threat to the power elite when his statements and actions suggest he&#39;s furthering their agenda?</p>

<p>Not only has he already backpedaled on his half promises, but one look at his campaign staff, advisors, transition team and the people being contacted for cabinet positions reveals a <em>&quot;who&#39;s who&quot;</em> of lobbyists, Wall Street bankers, defense executives and military intelligence assets, including truly-odious personalities like alleged Octopus member Ed Meese.</p>

<p>What&#39;s up with Trump wanting to dismantle NATO?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Nothing*. Hillary fear-mongering. Trump said NATO members need to pay their 2% of GDP.</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NATO">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NATO</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Members&#39; defence spending is supposed to amount to 2% of GDP.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Look up the % of GDP spending here:</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Member_states_of_NATO">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Member_states_of_NATO</a></p>

<p>Even Obama confirmed that Trump is ok with NATO:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Obama told reporters that Trump &quot;expressed a great interest in maintaining our core strategic relationships&quot; when they spoke last week at the White House.</p>
</blockquote>

<hr/>

<p>*</p>

<p>And whether he knew it or not, on one point, Trump was almost cribbing directly from Obama’s notebook when he said this:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“Our allies must contribute toward their financial, political and human costs — have to do it — of our tremendous security burden. But many of them are simply not doing so. They look at the United States as weak and forgiving, and feel no obligation to honor their agreements with us. In NATO, for instance, only four of 28 other member countries, besides America, are spending the minimum required 2 percent of GDP on defense. We have spent trillions of dollars over time on planes, missiles, ships, equipment, building up our military to provide a strong defense for Europe and Asia. The countries we are defending must pay for the cost of this defense. And if not, the U.S. must be prepared to let these countries defend themselves.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Strong words — that fit right in line with what Obama said in his speech to Europeans last week in Hanover, Germany (emphasis added):</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“We need to stay nimble, and make sure our forces are interoperable, and invest in new capabilities like cyber defense and missile defense. And that’s why every NATO member should be contributing its full share — 2 percent of GDP — toward our common security, something that doesn’t always happen. And I’ll be honest, sometimes Europe has been complacent about its own defense.”</p>
</blockquote>

<hr/>

<p>If you want a conspiracy, here it is: Russia would love nothing more than European countries to not spend their GDP on military but be dependent on USA. All Russia would have to do then is have only one target to weaken.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Trump can fuck off with his 2% ! </p>

<p>First of all 2% of trillions is not the same as 2% of just billions that some countries have, some countries are just too poor to afford 2%.</p>

<p>Secondly most of the countries even that 1%-1.5% they afford now, they use to buy weapons from USA while US uses most of those trillions to make those weapons.</p>

<p>3rd, it&#39;s not about the military budget only. USA gets a market for normal products, natural resources, influence, support, a theater of operations away from their land, allies and lots much more in return. Example: US company Bechtel should have made 400 km of highway in Romania with 2.5 billion euro, we ended up paying 5.6 billion euros for 62 km. That&#39;s the military budget for 3 years.</p>

<p>Clinton&#39;s camp purposely &quot;elevated&quot; Trump during the Republican primaries so that he would be the &quot;pied piper&quot; candidate. He was set up to be knocked down. Reflecting back on how I perceived him as a candidate 5 months ago, I think that strategy was working. Obviously, we now know it was a major mistake.</p>

<p>After he secured the leadership, that media coverage has been nearly 100% hostile to Trump. You&#39;d have to perform some serious mental gymnastics to argue that the goal of their coverage was to propel him to victory. I actually still think the whole Trump phenomenon is ridiculous, but the Democrats are just reaping the whirlwind here.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re totally right, and I recognize that prospect. Ultimately, making a firm decision on this issue (is Donald just part of the master plan?) is almost impossible because there&#39;s still too much we don&#39;t know.

<p>So some of that is true. But you accuse me of exaggerating then quote facts from fake news. If you can find any if that in the leaked emails, that&#39;d be great. Yes the foundation took money from SA, that&#39;s bullshit. The rest... exaggerated...</p>

<p>But now you have to defend Trump WITHOUT just saying how bad Hillary is. So go ahead and do that. </p>

<p>Also ad homonym attacks make you look stupid. And ironically young. Like you need to ask your parents what taxes are. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you want to understand the Trump love, read this transcript of his, less than a month before the election. Trump was speaking our language. Sure, he was doing it to gain power, and he likely has no interest in rocking the boat in a meaningful way. But, I think it was music to a lot of our ears to hear a candidate talking about broad-reaching establishment corruption by the upper class with the pure goal of gaining further enrichment.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s funny people are making a big deal about him refusing the President salary, when he&#39;s supposed to have billions (or at least hundreds of millions) tied up in real estate.</p>

<p>If he gets real estate values to go up 10% during his Presidency he&#39;d make millions more than the paltry 400k salary. Not to mention things of non-monetary value like helping draft laws that give more bailout guarantees to big business or reduce his liability to pay taxes or damages in lawsuits. None of which will get as big a headline as &quot;Trump takes $1 salary&quot;.</p>

<p>We already know Trump is a big fan of gaming the tax system to his benefit (claimed countless corporate &quot;bankruptcies&quot; to avoid debts and tax). The idea he would want to clean all that up after a lifetime of taking advantage of it is unbelievably gullible. </p>

<p>Question is how long can he carry on business as usual with all the Washington insiders and corporate elites he&#39;s surrounding himself with before his supporters realize it.</p>

<p>Reince Priebus, Chris Christie, Jeff Sessions, Rudi Giuliani, Steven Mnuchin...yeah, sounds like a real swamp draining there.  What a complete farce.  Insiders, insiders everywhere.</p>

<p>And you know, the one making me laugh the hardest at the backflips it&#39;s going to induce in delusional Trump supporters is Steven Mnuchin.  16 years at Goldman Sachs...16 years as a Wall Street insider at one of the most corrupt banking corporations which crippled the US in &#39;07 and caused the very money crunch that Trump has referenced at every turn to fire up the working class.  How exactly can Trump supporters still claim Trump is the anti-corruption candidate with a Cabinet containing Steve Mnuchin at the head of the Treasury?  It&#39;s fucking insane.</p>

<p>Trump university scam? Chinese steel? Stiffing contractors? Bribing attorneys? Misuse of Trump foundation funds? Possible sexual assaults? The &quot;locker room talk&quot; tape? His bizarre statements made about his own daughter on the Howard Stern show? His time hanging out with Epstein?</p>

<p>Theres a list a god damned mile long of Trumps bizarre, shady, and corrupt actions. But you wouldn&#39;t know it if you were relying on this sub for your news the last 6 months.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah the problem with that is the media jumped from one thing to another because there was so much and they were focused on talking points. If they really wanted maximum impact, they had to dig into it but they didn&#39;t spend nearly as much time as they should have really &quot;exploring&quot; it like we all explored the Clinton email case and had hours of testimony &amp; legal documents which were FAR more informative than a news broadcast. </p>

They leaked the first emails in chains first, then next, then next, until you hit Pizzagate shit, Brazile shit, etc. </p>

<p>I guess I could go back to Benghazi (which IMO still has not been fully delved into specifically the Marc Turi connection - real <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> material) as something that was drawn out so heavily, so much detail as to the misconduct, that it left a mark on people like the email scandal did. </p>

<p>I believe Clinton is corrupt too, but the major difference I&#39;ve seen between him and Clinton this election is that we&#39;ve barely seen ANYTHING about Trump&#39;s behind-the-scenes dealings. We&#39;ve been fortunate enough to explore massive investigations against Clinton, look at her and her foundation&#39;s financial records, see thousands of leaked and released emails, but we can&#39;t even see Trump&#39;s tax returns. I really don&#39;t like that there&#39;s some kind of assumption he&#39;s clean when he should be an obviously shady character and we know little beyond what he tells us.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There&#39;s a metric fuckton of dirt on Trump too, but it never gets talked about in this subreddit.</p>

<p>For instance, there&#39;s far more concrete evidence for Trump engaging in pay-for-play with Florida AG Pam Bondi than there is for the Clinton Foundation pay-for-play, but all <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> wants to talk about is the latter. Don&#39;t get me wrong, I&#39;m not saying this to dismiss Clinton Foundation issues. The Foundation is shady as fuck for sure. But regardless, the time devoted to each issue in this sub is completely out of whack with the strength of evidence in each case.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s another example: people in this sub were dredging up two decade old sexual assault allegations on Bill Clinton that have been resolved out of court, and simultaneously turning a complete blind eye to the multiple sexual assault allegations levied at Trump <em>right now</em>, which are in fact supported by Trump&#39;s own words captured on tape/video. Again, not trying to dismiss Bill Clinton&#39;s misconduct. He&#39;s obviously a predator. But time devoted to each issue in this sub is, again, completely out of whack with the strength of evidence in each case.</p>

<p>The point being that there was no semblance of truth or non-partisanship in <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> for the last 10+ months. This place turned into <a href="/r/the_donald">/r/the_donald</a> 2.0. And frankly, despite this post being on the front page, it&#39;s still mostly the same as before. Clinton lost the election and is no longer relevant in US politics, but people are still focusing on her instead of discussing the multitude of legitimate concerns following our current President-elect.</p>

<p>Which is why I can&#39;t take this place seriously anymore. I&#39;m done. It has become what it used to hate -- gullible group-thinkers, useful idiots being manipulated by the powerful.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Why I like Trump is because hes not afraid, or as afraid, to speak his own thoughts. For example he was interviewed on 9/11 there he said he couldbt understand how only one plane to each of the building could make them collapse, generel meaning i got. He seems to disagree to the political correctness. </p>

<p>Also FBI anon seemed to say there was little dirt on Trump.</p>

<p>Tax returns arent that important to me since i dont know if hillary has herself released hers.</p>

<p>I believe even though Trump is a billionare/at least rich he has a patriotic feel for his country.</p>

<p>I wish also to know if the title of nobility actually was completly ratified</p>

<p>He really seems to care about his supporters, has multiple rallies, tries to listen to some of their ideas, making an application for job website for his, either transistion team or administration, or both, or they are the same.</p>

<p>People critizise him for getting money from his father, then goes and builds a large organization</p>

<p>Hes a time traveller conspiracy. He has connection to Nicola Tesla through his uncle</p>

<p>Some of the reasons i could think of, for why i like trump</p>

<p>I also took a liking to Ron Paul and Trump seems like the closest republican in my eyes</p>

<p>This. People point out that Trump is better because of all of the dirt on Hilary. The reason for this is she is a politician and no matter how good a politician hides their less scrupulous dealings, there will ALWAYS be a paper trail because they are a civil servant. </p>

<p>Trump, like many billionaires, have no civil obligations and have much more powerful means to hide even delete their shady practices. Ditto for Soros, Rothschilds, Rockefellers, etc. At most you will find is some indirect connections,  </p>

<li><p>He enters markets he has no business being in to push his name(and usually fails)</p></li>
<li><p>He creates TV shows to push his brand</p></li>
<li><p>He used a political campaign to promote his businesses, including cycling campaign money back to himself through rental spaces, books, etc</p></li>
<li><p>He created a foundation to make himself look like a philanthropist despite not contributing any money to it, not doing any charity work by the foundation itself, and explicitly using foundation money for personal purposes</p></li>
<li><p>He threatens, and sometimes even files lawsuits against people who claim he&#39;s not as wealthy as he says he is</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Trump feeds off fortune, power, and fame. He hardly has a great reputation in the business world itself. His goals are achieved through his name power and his charisma. The idea that he&#39;s running for the middle class is beyond insane, when nothing in his history suggests he has any interest in helping anyone other than himself and his associates. </p>

Being able to get away from money that drives politics is a huge deal, and one of his declared plans for his &quot;first 100 days.&quot; Im no supporter, but its kind of easy to see how he would be fine with not utilizing his new political status for personal financial gain, when he can just leave in 4 or 8 years and go back to doing all the underhanded albeit likily legal shit he was always doing to keep on making more money than he ever could have as a politician. Unlike Bill and Hillary, who literally prey on the system to amass thier small fortune. </p>

<p>It&#39;s not correcting the records.  The other piece is that trumps campaign constantly says the media is owned by liberals and that they need to &quot;level the playing field&quot;... this is a blatant mistruth, as 90% of the media is owned by conservatives. By saying the opposite, the conservative campaign is using a sales tactic known as &quot;placing blame on them, to take that focus off of you.&quot; It&#39;s when you know they can easily make a negative point about yourself and before they do you blame them for having this negative attribute. You see this tactic uses many times in arguments, you know the person is going to be called a liar or that they &#39;don&#39;t care&#39;, but before they do they will blame that reason on the other person -then the other party will feel like their not fighting fair if they say, &quot;no that&#39;s you!&quot; I&#39;ve seen the Trump campaign use this tactic over and over.</p>

    <div class="md"><p><strong>JE is Jeffrey Epstein</strong>, the convicted sex offender and pedophile kingpin. He owns an airplane, referred to as <em>&quot;the Lolita Express,&quot;</em> and a private island, in addition to numerous homes. It has long been alleged by numerous highly-credible sources that child prostitutes were brought to Epstein&#39;s <em>&quot;parties,&quot;</em> attended by the rich and powerful. </p>

<p>Epstein&#39;s circle of friends include Trump, Bill Clinton, Edward and Evelyn de Rothschild, Queen Elizabeth II, David Rockefeller, Prince Andrew, Duchess Sarah Ferguson, Edgar Bronfman, Henry Kissinger, Peter Soros (George&#39;s son), Viscount William Astor, Ted Kennedy, Bobby Kennedy, John Kerry, Tony Blair, Jose Aznar, Richard Branson, Alan Dershowitz, Michael Bloomberg, Rupert Murdoch, Ed Koch, Ehud Barak, Kevin Spacey, Michael Jackson, Mick Jagger, Courtney Love and <em>many</em> others. </p>

<p>All of them appear in his infamous <strong><em>&quot;little black book,&quot;</em></strong> <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1508273-jeffrey-epsteins-little-black-book-redacted.html">which was leaked and can be read here.</a></p>

<p>The reality is that there are pedophile networks operating in every nation at every level of society and in virtually every walk of life. These networks are largely intertwined and a part of a larger international structure under the control of the same elements that are in control global drug and arms traffic, both underground trades repeatedly shown to be inextricably tied to human trafficking operations. </p>

<p>It would appear based on his address book alone that Epstein&#39;s ring is at the pinnacle of this global network. The unique concentration of the world&#39;s most powerful, closely-interlocked families  - Rothschild, Bronfman, Astor, Kennedy, Rockefeller and Windsor - makes that clear.  </p>

<p>Here is how Trump has described Epstein, convicted of multiple counts of sexual assault against children: </p>

<p><em>&quot;&quot;I&#39;ve known Jeff for fifteen years. Terrific guy, he&#39;s a lot of fun to be with. It is even said that he likes beautiful women as much as I do, and many of them are on the younger side. No doubt about it -- Jeffrey enjoys his social life.&quot;&quot;</em></p>

<p>Epstein and Trump certainly appeared to be close:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Epstein created a number of other odd categories, including one called &quot;Jeffrey.&quot; There were dozens of names in the Jeffrey category, including Ehud Barak, Alan Dershowitz, then–Senator John Kerry, former senator and lobbyist George Mitchell, powerhouse DC lobbyist Thomas Quinn, and David Rockefeller.</p>

<p><strong>Trump was also listed in this section. Under his name were 14 phone numbers, including emergency numbers, car numbers, and numbers to Trump&#39;s security guard and houseman.</strong></p>

    <div class="md"><p>This claim is merely sourced to their <em>&quot;investigation&quot;</em> and the only sources they quote are Trump&#39;s attorneys, legally obligated to represent his best interests, and an unnamed <em>&quot;associate&quot;</em> of Trump. Furthermore, their claim that Trump and Epstein <em>&quot;had no relationship&quot;</em> directly conflicts with the evidence in Epstein&#39;s address book and with Trump&#39;s own statements about their fifteen-year friendship.</p>

<p>You should keep in mind that <em>Radar Online</em> is a tabloid that has relentlessly supported Trump in the same way many other establishment publications have been backing Hillary Clinton. In its early days, it <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maer_Roshan#Career">was actually partly-financed by Epstein himself.</a></p>

<p>Around 2011-2012, <em>Radar Online</em> was purchased by <strong>American Media</strong>, headed by <a href="http://www.vanityfair.com/news/2016/09/is-the-national-enquirer-in-bed-with-donald-trump">Trump&#39;s close friend</a> David J. Pecker. </p>

<p>American Media also publishes <em>The National Enquirer</em>, which enthusiastically supported and endorsed Trump, and which leaked the information about Ted Cruz&#39;s extramarital affairs. After ownership of <em>Radar Online</em> passed to American Media, its founding staff and editors were <a href="http://investmentwatchblog.com/trump-sued-for-sex-crimes-via-epstein-here-are-the-facts-updated/">reportedly fired and replaced</a> with <em>Enquirer</em> personnel.</p>

<p>It&#39;s interesting to note that the <em>Enquirer</em> was <a href="http://dujour.com/news/national-enquirer-history-scandal/">founded by a CIA psychological warfare specialist and financed by Frank Costello, the head of the Luciano crime family, and Roy Cohn, Chief Counsel for the House Un-American Activites Committee.</a> Trump has maintained <a href="http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2016/05/donald-trump-2016-mob-organized-crime-213910">a lifelong association with the Mafia.</a> Cohn, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/1982/05/15/nyregion/notes-on-people-roy-cohn-joins-board-of-anti-communist-group.html">who sat on the advisory board</a> of <a href="http://rightweb.irc-online.org/western_goals_foundation/">the Western Goals Foundation</a>, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/06/21/us/politics/donald-trump-roy-cohn.html">was Trump&#39;s mentor.</a></p>

<p>I did find reference to <a href="https://news.vice.com/article/the-salacious-ammo-even-donald-trump-wont-use-in-a-fight-against-hillary-clinton-bill-clinton">a 2007 article in the New York Post</a> reporting that Epstein was banned from Mar-a-Lago. However, this was publicly announced weeks after he had plead guilty to sexual crimes against children and so it&#39;s likely this was simply for optics. </p>

<p>If they really had no relationship, why did he <em>still</em> have fourteen numbers for Trump in his address book?</p>

<p>Furthermore, Epstein isn&#39;t the only member of Trump&#39;s circle who has been directly implicated in organized pedophile operations.</p>

<p>From <em>The Franklin Cover-up</em> by John DeCamp:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Gray&#39;s associate Wilson was apparently continuing the work of a reported collaborator of Gray from the 1950s -- McCarthy committee counsel Roy Cohn, now dead of AIDs. According to the former head of the vice squad for one of America&#39;s biggest cities, <strong>&quot;Cohn&#39;s job was to run the little boys. Say you had an admiral, a general, a congressman, who did not want to go along with the program. Cohn&#39;s job was to set them up, then they would go along. Cohn told me that himself.&quot;</strong> </p>

</blockquote>

<p>From the Washington Times:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>[A businessman] described Mr. [Craig] Spence [<a href="http://www.whale.to/b/pedophocracy.html#The_Pedophocracy,_Part_II:__..._to_Washington_">operator of the D.C. &#39;call boy&#39; ring</a>]  as &quot;strange,&quot; saying that he often boasted that he was working for the CIA... Mr. Spence told him that the CIA might &quot;doublecross him,&quot; however, and kill him instead &quot;and then to make it look like a suicide.&quot; <strong>The businessman also said he attended a birthday bash for Roy Cohn at Mr. Spence&#39;s house.</strong> He said Mr. Casey was at the party.&quot;</p>

</blockquote>

<p>From the Straight Dope:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Ms. Rosenstiel claimed that in 1958 she and her husband went to a party at a New York hotel, where they met Hoover <strong>and McCarthy witch-hunt lawyer Roy Cohn.</strong> Hoover, whom Cohn introduced as &quot;Mary,&quot; was supposedly wearing a wig, a black dress, lace stockings, and high heels. Hoover went into a bedroom, took off his skirt to reveal a garter belt, <strong>and had a couple of blond boys — one wearing rubber gloves — &quot;work on him with their hands.&quot; Cohn and Hoover then watched while Lewis Rosenstiel had sex with the boys.</strong></p>

<p>Rudy Giuliani, who is <a href="http://www.wsj.com/articles/rudy-giuliani-john-bolton-are-leading-candidates-for-next-secretary-of-state-1479156004">currently being considered for Secretary of State</a>, headed the <em>&quot;investigation&quot;</em> of the pedophile operations at the prestigious U.S. Military Academy. Despite overwhelming evidence, Giuliani did not secure a single indictment and in fact facilitated the protection of the ring:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The West Point case, among others, was alleged to be linked to the Presidio case. As The Times Herald Record reported in June 1991, the &quot;incidents [at the West Point Child Development Center] unfolded against a backdrop of satanic acts, animal sacrifices and cult-like behavior among the abusers, whose activities extended beyond the U.S. Military Academy borders to Orange County and a military base in San Francisco, parents charged.&quot; The case first broke in July 1984, when a three-year-old girl found herself in the emergency room of the West Point Hospital with a lacerated vagina. She told the examining physician that a teacher at the daycare center had hurt her. The next month, the parents of another child leveled accusations of abuse at the center. As the Mercury News reported, &quot;by the end of the year, 50 children had been interviewed by investigators. Children at West Point told stories that would become horrifyingly familiar. They said they had been ritually abused. They said they had had excrement smeared on their bodies and been forced to eat feces and drink urine. They said they were taken away from the day care center and photographed.&quot;</p>

<p><strong>Despite abundant medical and psychological evidence and literally dozens of child witnesses, and despite &quot;950 interviews by 60 FBI agents assigned to the investigation,&quot; the investigation, &quot;led by former U.S. Attorney [and future mayor] Rudolph Giuliani&quot; produced &quot;no federal grand jury indictments,&quot;</strong> according to the Herald Record. <strong>&quot;In 1987, Giuliani said his detailed investigation showed only one or two children were abused.&quot; Giuliani&#39;s contention was directly contradicted by an independent investigation, as the Herald report divulged: &quot;a still-secret, independent report - produced by one of the nation&#39;s top experts on child sexual abuse - confirms the children&#39;s accusations of abuse.&quot;</strong></p>

<p><a href="http://www.real-debt-elimination.com/child_protection/child_sexual_abuse_at_the_Presidio_and_Westpoint.htm">www.real-debt-elimination.com/child_protection/child_sexual_abuse_at_the_Presidio_and_Westpoint.htm</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>It would later emerge that one of Giuliani&#39;s <em>&quot;oldest friends&quot;</em> is Fr. Alan Placa, a Catholic priest implicated in pedophile operations:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Rudy Giuliani&#39;s consulting firm, Giuliani Partners, has for years employed a Catholic priest who was accused by a grand jury of orchestrating the over-up of nearly 60 separate molestations allegation -- a priest who allegedly partook of the activities himself.</strong> The priest, Alan Placa, <strong>is one of Giuliani&#39;s oldest friends</strong>; in turn, <strong>Giuliani has become Placa&#39;s highest-profile defender.</strong> </p>

<p>Edit : For those who say &quot;It&#39;s just humor&quot;</p>

<p>Well it&#39;s not humor anymore when it turns into into a real and systematic way of obstructing any critic against Trump, banning any one who dissent from the &quot;Trump is perfect&quot; narrative, and drowning any critic of him with whataboutism (But HRC did this, HRC is gone, so now you guys have to find other ways to defend him) and insults. It&#39;s also telling that Trump supporters don&#39;t feel confortable when they are in another sub when their lord and savior can be criticized, they are too used to their safe space.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Haha, well if I&#39;m not mistaken, the anti-Christ is supposed to be loved by everyone right? Trump&#39;s coming into office with the lowest approval rating of probably any president.</p>

<p>Take what you will from it, but I find it hilarious. The fact that the establishment can&#39;t control the idea of it (especially the media) or whether people are serious or not about referring to Trump as the God-emporer makes it even better. It irritated the opposition &amp; establishment and gets under their skin, which is the whole point of trolling..and Trump has done some legendary trolling this election year. I mean, Hillary Clinton herself targeted a fucking green cartoon frog named Pepe as a white supremacist. Her <a href="https://www.hillaryclinton.com/feed/donald-trump-pepe-the-frog-and-white-supremacists-an-explainer/">campaign website</a> sourced an article where the &quot;white supremacist&quot; they interviewed about Pepe was actually a Jewish teenager who took on a Taylor Swift/Jared Taylor pseudonym. Just think about that: an actual journalist was too stupid to even catch on to the fake name and the Clinton campaign just accepted it as a sound article. Like, how stupid are they and it just questions their ability to identify and distribute news. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1EqkwHd1zI">It&#39;s fun to make fun of them though.</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>Still fits the &quot;let&#39;s pretend we are Warhammer40000 Space Marines and let&#39;s pretend Donald Trump is the God Emperor of Mankind!&quot; your disgust at what it looks like if taken seriously doesn&#39;t undo the grotesqueness present in a contemporary political figure spoken of as the living god of a Theocratic Junta... which would explain away the naivete at taking any internet support of Trump at face value. Anyone can switch words around after writing fanfic. notepad++ is  a nice example.</p>

<p>How does someone reason with a voice they hear mirrored in a satire like that? <a href="http://wh40k.lexicanum.com/wiki/Exterminatus">Exterminatus.</a> What earthly analog exists?</p>

<p>Like debating semantics with an intentionally crafted circular reasoning would be anything but feeding the trolls. Feeding a troll can make it president. Obviously.</p>

<p>Take what you will from it, but I find it hilarious. The fact that the establishment can&#39;t control the idea of it (especially the media) or whether people are serious or not about referring to Trump as the God-emporer makes it even better. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I commented this to another thread, but I think it&#39;s going to be something I end up re-commenting a lot because apparently it needs to be more widely-known:</p>

<p>My understanding of Trump is that he&#39;s not a loyalist to a party or an ideology. He does what he thinks at the time is the right thing to do - which leads to reversals of position on many subjects. If he were a rock-ribbed yellow-dog Democrat, or if he were just a New York Republican, charges of &quot;flip-flopper&quot; would have some meaning. But they don&#39;t, because he doesn&#39;t have a rigid ideal he adheres to. When he changes it&#39;s just a change, not an abandonment of principle. Combine that with the fact that he&#39;s 101% full of bluster, very self-confident, and accustomed to getting his way, and he&#39;s explained pretty thoroughly in my opinion.</p>

<p>I completely disagree. Bernie doesn&#39;t spread hate, fear and encourage violence among his supporters. And most importantly, he&#39;s not a goddamn moron. The only thing Bernie and Trump supporters have in common is that they both hate the establishment, that&#39;s literally it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That similarity is pretty powerful though. Obviously it was a major variable to Trump winning.

<p>Spreading fear? This is very subjective so I&#39;m not sure what you mean, but I do know that Liberals/Democrats are a much more sensitive bunch than anyone else. Fear of ISIS? You betcha. Fear of losing jobs to increasing illegal immigrant acceptance? You betcha. Fear of losing freedom of speech? You bet Trump is.

    <div class="md"><p>One of my co-workers, who is an engineer, told me his parents crossed the border illegally. He went to a top 10 engineering school, and is a good &amp; smart dude. This is just an anecdote, and I&#39;m not even saying most situations turn out this way. But Trump implied the opposite, that most are criminals, which IMO is unwarranted fear mongering. In his initial speech he never said &quot;illegal&quot; or &quot;undocumented&quot;, which I believe was a calculated move (i.e. dog whistle). Why do you think white nationalists support him across the board? Where were they for Romney, McCain, Bush?</p>

<p>I believe the truth is somewhere in the middle. Most illegals are just trying to make a better life for themselves and their families. You&#39;re more likely to find one in a restaurant kitchen than a dark alley waiting to mug you. Certainly we should secure our border and deport criminals. Seems to me like we&#39;ve been doing a good job of that under the Obama administration. Just look up his numbers and compare them to Bush (or any other administration).</p>

<p>I do hope, however, that this continues to open a more respectable discussion amongst eligible voters. Bernie surely helped to draw appeal from millennials and younger voters, and I do think that anyone getting involved with politics is a good thing. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The rules of the game was to win the electoral college, not the popular vote. How does it feel to lose the presidency in the way that our country&#39;s democracy has worked for hundreds of years? Probably bad, ey? </p>

<p>If the presidency was won through the popular vote, then both Trump and Clinton would have had a completely different game plan. If American football was won by who got the most rushing yards, then both teams would completely change their game plans in order to win.</p>

<p>Go figure Trump won. He followed the rules that have been decided for hundreds of years. </p>

<p>If the losing team got more rushing yards than the winning team, should they get the victory? NO, because they lost given the rules of the game. </p>

<p>You likely have been given a participation award your whole life from losing that you don&#39;t understand what it truly means to win or lose. Take a step back and realize that you lost regardless of any false circumstance you can think of. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Crimea is historically Russian and they overwhelmingly voted in a democratic referendum to return to Russia.  It was exactly what the people wanted, not some hostile takeover as described by Western Propaganda.</p>

<p>Saudi Arabia exports violent wahhabist terrorism across the globe and is the main funder of ISIS.  They buy massive amounts of weapons to support the Military Industrial complex, and absolutely ravage helpless nations such as Yemen.  They profit almost exclusively from selling oil and destroying the planet.</p>

<p>Russia is surrounded on all sides by advancing NATO forces and US military bases.  It has been fending off a massive geopolitical and economic war being waged on it by Western powers.  The war is waged through sanctions, West-backed Saudi move to sell oil so cheap that Russia must sell at a loss, Western takeover of neighbouring Nations (US was heavily involved in the Ukraine coup, almost identical strategy to Iran in 1953), and proxy/resource wars such as in Syria.</p>

<p>Russia isn&#39;t blameless, but it is the only country with the balls to stand up to the ultimate evil in this world: The Western War Machine.  But.. if you didn&#39;t know that, what the hell are you doing in this subreddit?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>i&#39;ll use the amendments, as i feel that would have the most backlash. Taking away most of our bill of rights, is not something that one side agrees with and one side hates, no one wants that.
1st Amendment; every one wants this, maybe an absolutely tiny minority, and the second amendment, applies to most trump voters in general. i think if he were to try something like that, we would see REAL protesting, with everyone coming together as one, to stop such an unconstitutional act from ever happening. Of course, maybe i have too much faith in humanity </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You don&#39;t need to be an ideologue to flip-flop. If you say &quot;This is my policy&quot; one day, then a week later you say &quot;Nevermind, my policy is now the complete opposite&quot;.</p>

<p>Then that&#39;s a flip-flop, regardless about whether you adhere to a strict ideology.</p>

<p>Of course sometimes people should, and do, learn something and change their position on it. The difference there is how often it happens, and how obvious it is that something is just pandering to whoever they happen to be speaking to at that particular moment.</p>

<p>Trump has most definitely flip-flopped a significant amount.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Before the election, it was either/or to many. Damaging Hillary meant electing Trump. Admitting Trump&#39;s flaws meant electing Hillary.</p>

<p>Now that&#39;s over, so maybe we can finally admit that Trump is the most full of shit person to ever win the presidency. Nearly every fact or stat he said was a lie, and his policy proposals wouldn&#39;t pass a financial review by a fifth grader.</p>

<p>Hell, in less than a week after winning he walked back like half of his ridiculous promises. Maybe it won&#39;t be a literal wall and Mexico paying isn&#39;t a priority, not looking at a Muslim ban yet, maybe we won&#39;t repeal Obamacare yet, not immediately deporting all illegals, we are probably moving on and not appointing a prosecutor for Hillary, etc. </p>

<p>20 million more with health care</p>

<p>4.5% unemployment.</p>

<p>and he deported a lot of illegal immigrants.</p>

<p>oh and bin laden.</p>

<p>and trump is already filling cabinet with lobbyists and corrupt politicians, like he said he wouldn&#39;t hahahaha. </p>

<p>Also, if you are blaming the last president, then might as well take that train all the way back. Obama didn&#39;t really leave as shitty a situation as bush. it&#39;s obviously not perfect, but it&#39;s never really been. </p>

</blockquote>

<p>She&#39;s many things...ambitions, calculating, cold, egomaniacal, narcissistic, but she&#39;s not crazy.  There&#39;s zero doubt in my mind that she would mostly do what&#39;s best for the country, even if you don&#39;t entirely agree with it.  You know where she stands and you know she&#39;s not going to blow up the world</p>

<p>Trump...only cares about himself.  Period.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>For one, I simply look at who are the biggest pushers of climate change, and how important it is to them. They want that sweet, sweet carbon tax, and to deindustrialize the West. It&#39;s pushed by the Rothschilds, the Rockefellers, the Clintons, Obama, Gore, etc etc etc. ALL THE USUAL SUSPECTS that should cause people on this sub to at least be suspicious if they are knowledgable <em>at all</em> on the subjects covered in this sub. </p>

<p>There is a very, very clear agenda of destroying the West right now, through mass immigration, through impossible debt, and through deindustrialization. The way TPTB always set up these things is like, oh, you either accept climate change, or you hate the environment and want us all to drown in rising oceans or a new ice age. I mean Al Gore owns plenty of property that, if he is right, will be flooded. Remember when all the top climate scientists got caught doctoring data? It was a huge scandal, but it just got pushed right under the rug. </p>

<p>I am personally all for massive shifts in the way we conduct business, capitalism, and all the rest of it, but how does deindustrializing the West, while allowing China and India and whoever else to fill the gap, how does that solve anything but fucking over Europeans while allowing other countries to become prosperous and take over the world? For me its not even about the science, I&#39;m not qualified to comment on that, and I wouldn&#39;t pretend to be. I am very, very concerned about the environment. </p>

<p>BUT the fact that the mainstream media and every other politician tries to ram climate change down our throats 24/7 makes me not trust the agenda one bit.</p>

<p>It&#39;s not an agenda, it&#39;s a fact. And they&#39;re shoving it down your throat because people need to accept it because it will destroy the planet if they don&#39;t.</p>

<p>So if your evidence for not accepting is because people you don&#39;t like believe in it, you&#39;re a goddamn idiot. You&#39;ll notice at no point in your post did you address any of the evidence. Just &quot;these people probably have ulterior motives because reasons!&quot;</p>

</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;ll bite. Do you know the level of CO2 in the atmosphere by percentage composition as of today? It&#39;s less than 0.1%. Do you know what it was during prehistoric times, like the age of dinosaurs? More than 10%. Do you also know about how vegetation THRIVED in high CO2 levels? CO2 is plant food. Reducing its levels drastically will impact farming, agriculture and vegetation as a whole and our survival as a species will be threatened heavily. Please note, that this is not an endorsement to open pollution; stopping pollution is a great idea, and a step forward to reduce our dependence on fossil fuels should be encouraged nonetheless.</p>

<p>Do you know the current state of the shitshow that is the carbon tax industry? Do you know that one of the biggest profiteers of that industry is Al Gore? Also, are you aware that all predictive climate models have FAILED so far? And that the trend in the garbage of a concept called &quot;global average temperature&quot; has been a completely flat line? Are you aware that the size of the Arctic Ice Cap has actually increased, the same Ice Caps Al Gore&#39;s rubbish documentary An Inconvenient <del>Truth</del> alleged would melt off completely by 2008?  Did you know that polar bear census has reported an all-time HIGH in its population??</p>

<p>Finally, I got one word for you: Climategate. Do let me know your thoughts on this scandal which reveals how prominent climate &quot;experts&quot; manipulated data before publishing to suit their agenda</p>

Historic CO2 levels, changing weather patterns, etc. are all great pieces of evidence but anyone who is genuinely trying to get the truth should be able to accept climate change as something that is really happening just based on research into blue ocean event alone. Someone can look at co2 levels and still be skeptical about their effects. A blue ocean event is very clearly a sign of change.</p>

<p>Again, you&#39;re misunderstanding. I&#39;m not labelling somebody stupid for believing something I don&#39;t. I&#39;m labelling them stupid for believing something for which there is no evidence to believe and for which their only obvious reason for believing is because they have an agenda and so everything needs to fit neatly into it. And a bit of overt racism as well.</p>

<p>I have no problem with plenty of things people believe that I don&#39;t, plenty of it isn&#39;t stupid whether I believe it or not. I have a problem with stupid things.</p>

<p>And again, I never said that this &#39;can&#39;t be talked about&#39; here. I just said it&#39;s dumb and <a href="/u/Kalki_Filth">/u/Kalki_Filth</a> is dumb for believing it. And even more dumb for not believing in manmade climate-change. Especially because his evidence for both of those beliefs is exclusively because those beliefs fit into his preconceived notion of how the world works.</p>

<p>Shit.</p>

<p>First off, I please tell me precisely where I said that they were respectable ideas? I would like to know. I sure don&#39;t see it.</p>

<p>Second, they are actual ideas. You don&#39;t have to like an idea for it to be an idea. Racism is an idea. Eugenics is an idea. Creationism is an idea. Calvinism and fatalism and nihilism are all fucking ideas, regardless of the dangers they may or may not bring along.</p>

<p>Are the Jews controlling the world? I don&#39;t think so. Has man affected the climate? Probably.

<p>No one is mad at them for it; it&#39;s just hard to verify info of which you can&#39;t identify the source, which is why people argue down this road.

<p>Timing is more about exposure.  Content dictates bias.</p>

<p>As to what wikileaks has on trump.  It is all speculation as to what is contained.  Just as the MSM chose not to report on any of the wikileaks emails WL can so choose not to report on leaks they recieve.  </p>

<p>The amount of shit flung at trump this election in and of itself gives good reason to assume that the wikileaks material is irrelevant.  And if such material were relevant and MSM is reporting on even fabricated trump stories why were they not privy to said leaks? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s curious how aggressive some of those comments are, and how quick they are to condemn Wikileaks. Some of which were straight up calling them out as an arm of Russian Intelligence. Others claiming that it&#39;s impossible to verify authenticity of their content. </p>

<p>Here&#39;s a conspiracy for ya: Turning an AMA into ammo to allow the old establishment to discredit them, and give a future candidate cover from anything damaging from Wikileaks. Render them to the state of RT, which is handily dismissed without consideration. Doesn&#39;t matter what it is that is being dismissed, but if it says RT in the corner, out with the trash. This is sowing seeds for a future effort.</p>

<p>We need to remember, we&#39;re now in a time where a politician was able to say just about anything, and despite &#39;fact checkers&#39; (and I do use that term very loosely), still won in the end. The art of persuasion is very strong, with Trump being one of the best at it. So his opponents are going to start ramping up their game. Wikileaks is a prime target for such a counter offensive. Taint them with Russia, or make the idea that what they have isn&#39;t necessarily accurate or outright lies, they could get people to outright dismiss anything from Wikileaks. Perception is king. Control people&#39;s perceptions, and you control reality.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, you didn&#39;t add the word &quot;some&quot; into your post until just now, so you pretty much just insinuated the entire leaks were nothing.</p>

<p>Of course, I really don&#39;t think it&#39;s fair to assume what is or isn&#39;t in unreleased leaks. Either way, RNC wasn&#39;t for Trump till he won the nomination, so I&#39;d not be surprised if they were less organized DNC copy-cat plans to get Jeb or Cruz or something else elected.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, with the context of the original post you commented on, I was pretty much picking on one specific email. According to the Wikileaks staff in the AMA, what they had on Trump was less significant than the DNC email, so I was citing it to point out the exact absurdity of that claim. If they were claiming that what they had on Trump was less important than the DNC emails as a whole, they were insinuating that they were less important than the least important DNC email.

<p>That doesn&#39;t make sense, and why assume? Wikileaks was clear, they don&#39;t censor, so you get your recipes. The RNC stuff was written in the context of a investigate journalist or something, and it was weak sauce, so you get none of it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>People have already mentioned the Trump stuff but there was some other shitty stuff. </p>

<p>I can&#39;t remember the exact quote but it was something along the lines of &quot;We release our leaks to have the most political, social, and cultural impact.&quot;</p>

<p>Some people will defend it, but if you are going to admit to &quot;controlling the narrative&quot; so to speak, don&#39;t act like you&#39;re a zealot for transparency. </p>

<p>To add to this they said the stuff they had on Donald wasn&#39;t important. Someone then asked if that was their criteria why did they feel it was necessary to release the social security number of a person who donated $10 to the DNC. As you can probably guess they didn&#39;t answer. </p>

<p>There was another question about how in 2010 Assange claimed to have something huge on Russia but never released it and then, two years later, was given a show on Russia Today. Again, no answer there. </p>

<p>The AMA created more questions than it answered, in my opinion. </p>

<p>He has all of the signs of classic Narcissistic Personality DIsorder, which means that he is extremely insecure and also craves attention and praise, and he fears that others will perceive him as incompetent.</p>

<p>He was bored and wanted to be president so he could say &quot;I got to be president.&quot; And he used his celebrity to appeal to morons who trusted that this billionaire could magically fix things.  Never mind that he&#39;s only a billionaire because his dad was a finance/business genius. Trump is just a trust fund kid who, according to finance experts, has actually done worse in business than if he&#39;d just put his holdings from 35 years ago into unmanaged stock funds and let it sit there.</p>

<p>A lot of people aren&#39;t aware of what true narcissists are. You did a good job of explaining it but l&#39;m going to add some more stuff in. These people are <em>completely</em> void of empathy. Other people are objects to them. They feel the same way about their wives as they do their cars or their televisions. They&#39;re extremely manipulative. They can&#39;t truly love anyone but themselves.</p>

<p>It&#39;s hard for mentally healthy people to comprehend narcissists. Just try to imagine how easy it would be to lie and manipulate people if you literally saw them as objects. It&#39;s effortless. Any pain or unhappiness you cause is meaningless to you. The only thing you&#39;re susceptible to (generalizing here) is shame.</p>

<p>And the weirdest part is that they admit they&#39;re narcissists. They&#39;ll openly talk about it like it&#39;s nothing. The girl I knew who had it was almost proud of it. </p>

<p>I just don&#39;t think there&#39;s any way to lower costs for manufacturing in the US enough to compete with the third world countries where so much of our manufacturing is being done.

<p>In Philadelphia recently, he promised to bring back the Philadelphia Navy Yard, a huge Naval shipyard, where Navy ships were built and repaired.</p>

<p>The Navy Yard is now the location of an office park, with 150 business tenants, including some corporate headquarters. Thousands of office workers are employed there. There&#39;s also a shipyard still, but it mostly works on cargo ships; the location is unsuitable for work on modern aircraft carriers (too shallow, I think). And there are still US Navy offices.</p>

<p>The point is, Trump made a promise to bring back specific manufacturing jobs which is impossible for him to fulfill. The best that can be said in his defense is that he probably had no clue about what he was talking about, and only knew that there used to be a big shipyard there, that closed.</p>

<p>She was accused of these things, and the Republican FBI director said she did none of these things. No charges. No indictment. Which part of that don&#39;t you understand?</p>

<p>We often let politicians off after doing illegal things, but when Clinton is accused of things, investigated, and exonerated, we blow it up.</p>

<p>Look: it is quite clear that you never would have voted for her. This requires you to exaggerate her flaws to convince yourself why you should vote for Trump.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, you have to assess for yourself if you think they are for the people. The guy is lowering taxes on the rich. Experts say he will make inequality much worse and make the economy worse. Experts also say that Hillary&#39;s economic plans would be much better &quot;for the people.&quot; Meanwhile, she has the environmental policy that is &quot;for the people&quot; too, and so many other policies that are for the people.</p>

<p>What actual policy does Trump have that&#39;s actually for the people? Can you name one that appears to be legit?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The most obvious thing is on taxes. Experts from <a href="http://www.taxpolicycenter.org/taxvox/latest-trump-tax-plan-adds-trillions-national-debt-clinton-plan-trims-deficits-taxing-wealthy">the Tax Policy Center (a non-partisan research group)</a> say Trump&#39;s policies will cut taxes on the rich and mostly benefit corporations, raise taxes on some in the middle class, reduce federal revenue by over $6 trillion, add trillions of dollars to the debt, and basically be very bad for the economy over time.</p>

<p>Clinton would raise taxes on the rich, reduce taxes for the poor and middle class, and overhaul corporate taxes, resulting in an increase in revenue of $1.4 trillion that she would have used for education funding and other initiatives.</p>

<p>Trump&#39;s tax breaks might look good in the beginning, but this will totally decimate the ability of government to function for us the way it should.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, perhaps what you&#39;re talking about are his <em>claims</em> that he&#39;s done things for people? I know he bragged about donating money to 9/11 charities. But there&#39;s no evidence that he donated any:

<p>He has also claimed to donate millions of dollars to charities for veterans and others, but evidence has only found that he has donated about $10,000:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-promised-millions-to-charity-we-found-less-than-10000-over-7-years/2016/06/28/cbab5d1a-37dd-11e6-8f7c-d4c723a2becb_story.html">https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-promised-millions-to-charity-we-found-less-than-10000-over-7-years/2016/06/28/cbab5d1a-37dd-11e6-8f7c-d4c723a2becb_story.html</a></p>

<p>Seriously, there is verifiable fact that he just lied about donating money, so he benefited from the perception that he donated the money while donating little to nothing.</p>

<p>theres more stories like this, alot more. i sincerely doubt he hasnt given a substantial amount to help people over the years. everyone who knows him says he&#39;s a good guy, mike tyson included, and tyson can smell bs from a mile away. just my 2 cents. i do think this sub should be for conspiracy though, something p   i z z a related perhaps</p>

    <div class="md"><p>OK seriously. Answer me a question: Does it matter to you whether anything you read is false or true? This is not a hypothetical question. Can you answer this?</p>

<p>Because this story is FALSE: <a href="http://www.snopes.com/donald-trumps-marine-airlift/">http://www.snopes.com/donald-trumps-marine-airlift/</a></p>

<p>What&#39;s the true story? Trump previously owned this plane -- a commercial plane (not his private plane) when he tried to create &quot;Trump Airlines.&quot; This airline failed in 1990, and Trump lost control of this plane. This was a year before these military veterans were flown in this plane with &quot;Trump&quot; on the side.</p>

<p>The US military chartered and paid for these flights. Again, they paid a company that owned this plane after Trump owned it. Trump had literally nothing to do with this.</p>

<p>Isn&#39;t it possible that many -- perhaps even all -- of the stories like this that you&#39;ve read are actually false?</p>

<p>If you&#39;re willing to believe this story without doing a simple Google search to verify it&#39;s veracity, I have no faith that you actually verified the veracity of any of the other stories. In fact, I assume that if you believe this bullshit, that you&#39;ll believe any bullshit as long as it supports what you believe about Trump.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not sure if you trust the Washington Post (if not, who do you trust??) but The Washington Post interviewed a military veteran about this and debunked it here: <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2016/08/11/too-good-to-check-sean-hannitys-tale-of-a-trump-rescue/">https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2016/08/11/too-good-to-check-sean-hannitys-tale-of-a-trump-rescue/</a></p>

<p>Or why don&#39;t you try reading the Snopes article, instead of dismissing it without reading it? At least I read the dumb article that was referred to me.</p>

<p>Snopes references an interview with Lieutenant General Vernon Kondra, retired Air force.  Here&#39;s the description with background from Snopes, with his words in quotes:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>There are several references to a 1990-91 contract for Trump Shuttle to carry personnel across the United States, between the East and West Coasts, on a standard LaGuardia-Dover-Charleston-Travis-Chord-Kelly-Dover-LaGuardia run.</p>

<p>&quot;It worked very well, and the crews loved it, and really thought that we&#39;d done something special for them,&quot; Kondra recalled in the oral history. &quot;It was a helluva lot better than using 141s [cargo craft], which we could use for something else.&quot;</p>

<p>But Kondra said that the notion that Trump personally arranged to help the stranded soldiers made little sense. &quot;I certainly was not aware of that. It does not sound reasonable that it would happen like that. It would not fit in with how we did business. I don&#39;t even know of how he would have known there was a need.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve got a little secret for you: you won but you lost. Your life is going to get worse because of Donald Trump. For a little while, you won&#39;t see the difference because the inertia of Obama&#39;s economic policies will make it look like things are going OK. And then Trump will lower your taxes and things will maybe even temporarily go a little better.</p>

<p>Behind your back, Trump will be lowering taxes a lot more on rich people, and revenue for roads, schools, police, and other important social infrastructure will erode. Then Trump will tell you that this is clear that government is a failure, and then you might vote for him again because you&#39;ll think that all of this is not his fault. And then your life will get worse. And in 8 years, if Trump won re-election, your life will be definitely worse. The country will definitely be in worse shape -- there is no denying this given that his plans will lead to a massive revenue shortfall of over $6 trillion. He&#39;ll engage in a war with ISIS that could escalate.</p>

<p>But you think he has it all under control, and you have no evidence for believing this.</p>

<p>So what I&#39;m saying is that you own this. You own these problems now. The sad thing is that you think this is just a game between two teams of equal merits. What&#39;s actually funny -- in a black comedy sort of way -- is that you have no ability to understand that your dear leader is a feeding on your misguided fears -- fears of a terror threat that statistics show is under control, fears of an economic problem that Trump will make worse.</p>

<p>I&#39;ll take some solace in the fact that I tried to tell people what would happen and they wouldn&#39;t believe me. I hope you&#39;ll remember in 10 years or so that the liberals were right.</p>

He is &quot;technically&quot; outside of the establishment, or was.  I think that&#39;s why people are putting more behind him.  Yes, he&#39;s a rich fuck, but he&#39;s just a rich fuck.

<p>But is everyone outside the establishment automatically free of corruption? I mean, have you looked at Trump&#39;s phony unversity? Or his false claims of donating millions of dollars to charity (<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-promised-millions-to-charity-we-found-less-than-10000-over-7-years/2016/06/28/cbab5d1a-37dd-11e6-8f7c-d4c723a2becb_story.html">9/11 charities, veterans charities, and others while actually only donating about $10,000?</a>).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Is everyone automatically free of corruption? Absolutely not, but I&#39;m speaking relatively.  He&#39;s the new fish in the pond, so he deserves more slack than someone who&#39;s been swimming in the soup for 40 years.  That&#39;s my only point/position on that.  I get that he&#39;s done some bad things, and he lied, but that&#39;s not the same as furthering an agenda like a global gov&#39;t.  It&#39;s just not the same thing.  Trump is peanuts comparably.

    <div class="md"><p>The idea that being in the establishment is worse than not being establishment is just based on a hunch. It&#39;s not based on any evidence. I mean, we have no evidence that an anti-establishment outsider can be a good president. So you&#39;re just guessing, and that is really scary.</p>

<p>Also, I hate his policies. Do you know his policies? Most of his policies are totally untested and incredibly risky. Part of the thing about the establishment, even if you don&#39;t like it, is that it uses tried and true policies and doesn&#39;t try to take huge risks.</p>

<p>It&#39;s kind of like this, I guess: Do you want a gambler as the president or not? That&#39;s what he is, and he&#39;ll be gambling with all of our futures.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Do you really think that Obama did a bad job on foreign policy? Trump acts like this is an easy thing to do, and he&#39;s fucking delusional.</p>

<p>Obama used diplomacy and drone campaigns more than his predecessors, pulling out ground troops when possible. Far from perfect, but all in all we stayed out of conflicts and avoided excessive military spending, avoided a lot of dead veterans, and let people in the Middle East fight things out. And we&#39;ve occasionally helped the &quot;preferred&quot; side in conflicts between two groups.</p>

<p>Hillary would do about the same as Obama did. Trump says he is going to go over and destroy ISIS. Do you really think that Trump will be less involved in military conflicts if he plans to do what&#39;s necessary to destroy ISIS? This will require either ground troops or major bombing campaigns (or both).</p>

<p>Furthermore, there is risk that these actions will trigger something worse, like getting other nations involved against us. World War III is not ridiculous to consider as a possible development.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>First of all, let&#39;s just get out of the way that you&#39;re apparently preferring a guy who praises Russia and Putin while criticizing someone who takes on Saudi Arabians as allies.</p>

<p>Bush destabilized the Middle East. Most of the things happening there are an outgrowth of the Iraq War and then the subsequent Arab Spring.</p>

<p>How do you figure that Hillary created anything? The thing about being allies with Saudi Arabia is that it has always been an uneasy alliance that is preferable to having them as enemies. Haven&#39;t you ever watched any movies to understand that you sometimes need to make allies you don&#39;t love? You know, &quot;the enemy of my worst enemy is my friend.&quot;</p>

<p>To understand why she and other leaders have been allied with Saudi Arabia, all you have to do is ask yourself if we&#39;d be better off with Saudi Arabia as an enemy or a friend. Similarly, we have been better off to do what we did in Iraq, or to continue putting pressure on them while preferring diplomacy and restraint?</p>

<p>I worry that Trump does not understand the value and importance of diplomacy, of our traditional relationships, even the relationships that come with questionable people.</p>

<p>Its also not a requirement to be an anarchist to participate in this sub.  There are a lot of misconceptions in here about &quot;litmus tests&quot; being a viable way to discern who is a shill and who is a real person.  I find that to be a ridiculous notion, its entirely possible that real people hold the same opinion that a shill is being paid to promote.

    <div class="md"><p>It is somewhat nice that we can look at Trump&#39;s behavior in office and derive some answer to the old question about whether or not the President actually has any control over his administration or whether it&#39;s all just for show. </p>

<p>He definitely has an ego. Some shadowy people in suits showing up in the oval office telling him what to do, when he considers himself the most powerful person in the world, will certainly illicit a reaction.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, it was the alt-right that introduced me to Operation Paperclip which inducted Nazis into our space and intelligence agencies to get ahead of Russia during the Cold War.</p>

<p>It backfired.</p>

<p>The agencies went rogue by becoming so classified the country is now suffering a deep state much like the SS during Nazi Germany.</p>

<p>From my experience most alt-right news is about global economics and how today&#39;s military-industrial complex is exploiting the Federal Reserve, the War on Drugs, and the War on Terror.</p>

<p>Anyways, let go of the left-right paradigm: it&#39;s a fucking illusion. The establishment controls both sides. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You will never know a world that starts with truth, only ends with it. At least, that is the only hope you can carry.</p>

<p>And yes, you can take an honest stance based on lies if you believe them to be truth. And, without an ID, an ego, that something which corrupts truth, you could never ever find the direction to seek it.</p>

<p>Information isn&#39;t flawed, reason is. Information is the product of reason, and even in lies there is a reason.</p>

<p>How would you know the &quot;truth&quot; in anything? Honesty is not truth, by the way. Unless you mean transparent information, which isn&#39;t truth, either.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yikes. Once again, you&#39;re just not using English correctly. &quot;articulate yourself&quot; is incorrect - you can just say &quot;articulate&quot;, the &quot;yourself&quot; is redundant. And there&#39;s no way you&#39;re going to be able to argue that &quot;satisfy the issue&quot; is in any way grammatically correct... it&#39;s simply nonsensical. You don&#39;t satisfy an issue. It&#39;s just not correct. </p>

<p>You need to try to simplify your writing so that it becomes clearer. I think you&#39;ll find that fewer people will misinterpret your comments that way. Using phrases like &quot;articulate yourself&quot; or &quot;satisfy the issue&quot; is going to lead to confusion. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t care. Communication is full of nuance, and I&#39;ll use it, whether or not it confuses you or everyone. &quot;Articulate yourself&quot; is fine form. In fact, it&#39;s meant to point to a direct subject; you. Not an idea you have, but yourself.</p>

<p>But go ahead, take the last word.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sure, but the rules of grammar exist to <em>facilitate</em> communication. This isn&#39;t a matter of nuance, it&#39;s a matter of being intelligible. </p>

<p>&quot;Articulate yourself&quot; is wrong because it&#39;s redundant. The word &quot;articulate&quot; as a verb means &quot;to speak&quot; or &quot;to communicate&quot;, so it&#39;s obvious that when you say &quot;you lack the ability to articulate&quot; that you&#39;re speaking about <em>me</em> as the one that&#39;s articulating. Understand? This is what I mean when I say that simplification will go a long way towards making it easier to communicate for you. </p>

<p>On the other hand, if you&#39;re fine with literally adding unnecessary confusion when you communicate, then carry on!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m still waiting for r/conspiracy to get interested in the allegations that the Trump campaign actively worked to purge the names of about 1 million voters from the voter rolls in several battleground states, targeting names of people with last names like &quot;Garcia,&quot; &quot;Jackson,&quot; etc... that are probably minorities. This investigation started long before the election. It appears to have purged far more than enough voters in several close states that it could have swung the election. </p>

You&#39;re making it a talking point.  It&#39;s come up as strategy.  Betting on voters believing you and switching sides to vote for you?  I dunno.  But there&#39;s a really common tactic in both business and politics that when you&#39;re caught or about to get caught doing something shady, you immediately start accusing the other side of doing it first.  So that when they try to accuse you, they sound ridiculous, repetitive, less shock value in the news.  </p>

<p>We saw it in the debates when he kept sniffling all the time, then people were accusing him of being on coke, and then suddenly he starts accusing Clinton of being on drugs during the debates, for no discernible reason?  It&#39;s a strategy play.  So maybe accusing it of being rigged for Clinton was to deflate anyone accusing him of rigging it if he won.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m telling you right now in this <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> sub, there was some shady shit happening at </p>

<ul>
<li>the local caucusus (coin flips always going Clintons way. They would reflip the coin anytime Sanders won. I was at these caucuses and I saw it happen first hand.)</li>
<li>the county conventions (Clinton delegates receive regular ballots while Sanders delegates received provisional ballots few of which were counted)</li>
<li>and then there are the state conventions like the one in California where exit polls differed by more than %20, a clear indication of election fraud. </li>
</ul>

<p>So tell me... how is that not rigging an election?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No she stacked the DNC election process heavily and overtly in her favor. She didn&#39;t rig it. It was disrespectful to all registered democrats. It was supremely conceited to think that guaranteeing her candidacy in this political climate, coming off of 8 years of vitriol against Obama, would easily guarantee her election to the presidency. She made a choice that cost America dearly, and because she wanted to be president she deserves every bit of blame a president would for the consequences of their actions even if those consequences are not entirely her fault.</p>

<p>There were a number of people who did attempt to rig the campaign in her favor but ultimately the DNC is not a strictly democratic institution, it is a political party so any chicanery that happens within it is not the same as rigging an election. It does make me loose trust in the ability of the perpetrators of that sort of rigging to respect the institution of democracy, but it doesn&#39;t strictly break that institution.</p>

<p>Sanders himself is responsible for his own failure. Had he taken his campaign seriously from the start he would have gone into the primary season with a solid ground game and pushed hard to compensate for the lack of name recognition. He did not do that until later in the campaign, and consequently was too hamstrung to push back against everything Hilary was doing to shut him out of the political discussion. He wanted to be president and he gets judged similarly: that was his fault and ultimately he is responsible for his own loss.</p>

<p>they don&#39;t even have all of them. </p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>She should be. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Any scandal or allegations I&#39;ve seen against her have turned out to be bullshit.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Liar and biased.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>3 women said he assaulted them -- and you believe them.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>He has had to pay a lot of women in court over the years. Including one of those three women. And yes I do believe them. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>ut the same exact evidence exists that Trump raped/assaulted women.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Not as much evidence as Bill Clinton, and if there was I&#39;d say fuck him too. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>but you don&#39;t believe the 15 or so women who have accused Trump of assault? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>No because those women came out early, went to court, got paid off, they have proof they met Bill Clinton, and haven&#39;t changed their stories once. There stories fit too, a lot of the women.. and it&#39;s been more then 3.</p>

<p>The ones that said it about Trump all have holes in their stories, like the one who said Trump touched her on a plane, when there wasn&#39;t even armrests that went up on the plane she was describing for example. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>And Bill was not running for president!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Last time I checked he would have been back in the white house, and Hillary said he would be taking care of the economy. Her words. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>What do you make of the infamous &quot;grab her by the pussy&quot; tape? Even if it was &quot;locker room talk&quot; it still shows his attitude towards women and his own fame in regards to what he can get away with.</p>

<p>Even if he was just trying to brag and sound &quot;cool&quot; in front of Billy Bush (lol), his words clearly show that he has thought about what he can and do to women. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t know much about the allegations towards Bill except for the Monica Lewinsky scandal. What evidence is there to support the claim that he raped women? I don&#39;t necessarily doubt it, but everything I&#39;ve seen about it seemed to be not very substantial. What evidence is there? </p>

<p>Also you say there is &quot;more evidence&quot; of Bill Clinton&#39;s allegations than there is of Trump&#39;s. The evidence against Trump is a primary source. I guess it&#39;s up to interpretation, but an audio recording of him saying he can get away with sexual assault is pretty damning.</p>

<p>Let&#39;s say Trump was just a normal guy that we both knew, and he was being accused by multiple women of sexual assault. Let&#39;s say there were a tape of him joking about sexual assault. I&#39;d wager that we would both at least suspect that he did it and that a court would see that as pretty strong evidence. </p>

<p>Also, I believe that the claim about the airplane seat not moving up was proven to be false by people who worked for the airline company themselves. <a href="http://money.cnn.com/2016/10/14/news/donald-trump-jessica-leeds-armrest/">The fact that the rest moved was in the flight manual (which is another primary source)</a>. <a href="http://qz.com/808368/photos-of-airline-seats-from-the-1970s-and-1980s-undermine-donald-trumps-denial-of-groping-allegations/">Another link.</a>.</p>

<p>Furthermore why would any of these women risk putting themselves out there in the public eye and say they were assaulted? None of them wanted money. It wasn&#39;t a case of someone wanting to be paid off in court. </p>

<p>All of the alleged victims I&#39;ve seen have seemed very genuine and distraught over the whole thing. I suppose that&#39;s not a very concrete point since it&#39;s my own opinion, but it&#39;s not nothing.</p>

<p>And what do you make of the fact <a href="http://leakyou.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Donald-Trump-Accusers.png">most of the accusers</a> groped all were tall, attractive blondes? </p>

<p>It really seems like the accusations hold water.</p>

<p>Curious about Clinton though. </p>

<p>I&#39;m a women and heard worst stuff from other women. That&#39;s what I think about it. </p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Yeah he&#39;s a famous billionaire man. They get lots of girls all over them. Is anyone really that surprised? </p>

<blockquote>
<p>don&#39;t know much about the allegations towards Bill except for the Monica Lewinsky scandal.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>He literally has a whole wikipedia page on his sexual misconduct allegations: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Clinton_sexual_misconduct_allegations">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Clinton_sexual_misconduct_allegations</a></p>

<p>He has a long history also of treating women very poorly, I mean the Monica Lewinsky case being the biggest. </p>

<p>Gennifer Flowers who did have sexual relations with him, and is well known, came out and even said Bill had a sex addiction. </p>

<p>All of the women have kept their stories straight, some for decades. </p>

<hr/>

<blockquote>
<p>audio recording of him saying he can get away with sexual assault is pretty damning.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>He never once says in the whole audio did he say he can get away with sexual assault. He says women let him just grab their pussy. LET HIM. Allow him. Consensual. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>I&#39;d wager that we would both at least suspect that he did it and that a court would see that as pretty strong evidence.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>He didn&#39;t joke about sexual assault. And its funny near the end of the campaign, after a audio comes out, so many women all of a sudden come out claiming he sexually assaulted them. But a lot of those stories were already found out as fraud, or had major holes in their stories. Like details that didn&#39;t make sense at all. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Also, I believe that the claim about the airplane seat not moving up was proven to be false by people who worked for the airline company themselves. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Why didn&#39;t they also add that their was a witness there the whole time and said nothing happened? </p>

<p>Also those links are saying that there is armrests that go up in first class, yes in some planes. But most do not have armrests that go up like your 2nd link suggests. That&#39;s very few. And even in your first link they mention she got the flight wrong. </p>

<p>But the biggest thing, regardless of armrests or not, is that there was a witness. </p>

<hr/>

<blockquote>
<p>Furthermore why would any of these women risk putting themselves out there in the public eye and say they were assaulted?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There have been tons of cases where women lie for attention, fame, wealth, or just to lie. I mean I read a case once where a women stabbed herself and hit herself, and then claimed she was raped, for no reason. </p>

<p>Also wouldn&#39;t this statement hold true for Bill Clinton?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>None of them wanted money. It wasn&#39;t a case of someone wanting to be paid off in court.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Really? better go look for what they want from those lawsuits. Is it money? Cause pretty sure it&#39;s money. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>All of the alleged victims I&#39;ve seen have seemed very genuine and distraught over the whole thing.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Most of them have already been found out as frauds, and the rest have holes in their story. sooo.. </p>

<p>I think all of them seem like liars. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>And what do you make of the fact most of the accusers groped all were tall, attractive blondes?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>uh, most people dye their hair blonde.. and there is a lot of brunettes, and were brunette when they said it happened?.. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>It really seems like the accusations hold water.</p>

<p>but they don&#39;t. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;The Fed&quot; is the Federal Reserve, which has nothing to do with marijuana laws. &quot;The Fed&quot; does not refer to the federal government.</p>

<p>And you&#39;ve got it the wrong way around. It&#39;s states that aren&#39;t allowed to reverse federal laws.</p>

<p>Any law within the competence of the federal government can override state law if Congress wants it to, iirc. And the federal government has pretty broad lawmaking powers, including the power to ban cannabis.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ok, you&#39;re wrong. Those state laws are in direct violation of federal law. They&#39;ve been allowed to continue because the Obama administration and his justice department have essentially agreed not to prosecute. </p>

<p>But an anti-weed attorney general - like Christie - could most assuredly decide to reverse course and give all states  six months or a year to shut it down. </p>

<p>Would people protest/riot? Sure. But it wouldn&#39;t change anything. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah no. That&#39;s not how things work. The people in California and Colorado didn&#39;t just wake up on election day and decide to vote for legal weed. It took years and years and years of lobbying, fundraising, and campaigning - licensed, straight edge, nerdy looking lawyers studying laws and meeting with elected officials and inching their way closer to a ballot initiative. Even then it took a bunch of failed referendums to finally pass. </p>

<p>That&#39;s what it will take - and then some - on the federal level. People like you, who stand in the background and call for rash actions and scream about anarchy and revolution and all that bullshit, never accomplish a damn thing. Because that&#39;s not how the world works. </p>

<p>And because you literally don&#39;t even know how to spell secede. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Dear god that shit has been making me not want to use Reddit anymore. I mean, I appreciate that Reddit is supposed to support free speech, but they&#39;ve made a habit of banning hateful and scary inappropriate subs (r/fatpeoplehate, r/picsofdeadkids, etc). I think the only reason they haven&#39;t banned r/The_Donald is that they don&#39;t want to handle the backlash, which I understand after the meltdown that occurred after r/fatpeoplehate was banned - but still, this shit is getting out of hand. It isn&#39;t funny, it&#39;s just garbage threads filled with incredible hate and cult-like rhetoric. It&#39;s really making this site unbelievably unpleasant. </p>

<p>For fucks sake, r/The_Donald started as a freaking 4chan operation. It&#39;s a joke, but they ban anyone who calls it out and the sub successfully snowballed to the point where they now just have strength in numbers. They&#39;re everywhere, too! It&#39;s one thing to spew bullshit in a designated bullshit sub, and that&#39;s bad enough, but so many of them are flooding every sub they can, and just finding reasons to be hateful across this entire website. Something needs to change. This shit is too much.</p>

<p>No, you didn&#39;t &quot;meme Trump into the White House.&quot; Nobody wants to see infinite &quot;pepes&quot; and nonstop ludicrous and hateful rhetoric. Somebody needs to start a petition or something. I really wish they&#39;d all just go to voat like all the r/fatpeoplehate morons did.</p>

Even now they make a habit of brigading posts and comments, and it&#39;s just become sort of accepted since they&#39;ve essentially flooded Reddit. </p>

<p>I can&#39;t fathom why all of what they do isn&#39;t considered to be a big deal. It&#39;s disruptive, disrespectful, and childish.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If alt-right is synonymous with seeking truth, then yes. Otherwise, not really. What you&#39;re seeing is the exposition of the vast corruption of democratic party and leftist policy. Recognizing that doesn&#39;t mean someone is alt-right, right, or whatever. Are we not allowed to have objectivity?</p>

<p>People confuse unbiased as somehow meaning that things will always be equal, but that&#39;s not the case. It&#39;s the same idea against black crime. They cite a disproportionate amount of blacks as being evidence of institutional racism. They want &quot;balance&quot; like you can&#39;t have a greater percentage of blacks in prison over whites. Well, why not? If blacks are committing criminal acts at a higher percentage, then it is what it is.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Because T_D was doing the majority of the digging through wikileaks to take down Clinton. It was a mutally benificial relationship at the time. Now that he has won the sub is going to have to dig on him too because his administration is now the most powerful and unchecked administration in history. Senate, house, white house, and supreme court. He will get away with murder. </p>

<hr/>

<p>Disclaimer: I feel like he is playing the Clintons right now. I think he is not going to be prosecuting them because once he swaps FBI directors he will have complete control of the entire government and he will OWN the Clintons and get whatever the hell he wants past. I also am okay with this because I want all of the right wing stuff to pass. Mass deportation, tax code change, entitlement reform, gerrymandering, and anything else that brings us back from this PC culture where kids are absolute pussies. I am done with the left and I want them absolutely annihilated from the history books.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Again, an insignificant amount of people that visit reddit actually look through the comment section. So even if 5-6 million pair of eyes saw this thread (probably an overestimation since conspiracy isn&#39;t a default and most people don&#39;t browse /all, only 10% of them are actually going to click the link, 10% of those will read through a meaningful amount of comments giving you about 50.000 pair of eyes. Even if you double the people seeing it on the frontpage that&#39;s still only 100.000 pair of eyes on an anonnymous forum. It&#39;s significant to reddit for sure, but I&#39;d be extremely surprised if it was a target of any priority for any organization aiming to seriously influence the national discourse through social media.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So you want to silence half the country and eliminate them? That&#39;s sounds a lot like fascism. PC culture is a small part of the left. Those that are for PC culture are ignorant and regressive, and in no way represent the actual values of the vast majority of left-wingers. Just like how insane racists/homophobes are in no way the majority of right-wingers. I am a left-winger, but I totally agree with some right-wing ideas and would like to see Trump implement them. But there are also left-wing ideas that are also good for the nation. It&#39;s all about finding the common ground between both groups to improve the nation. Trump&#39;s plan for infrastructure is a great idea, for instance. Edit: Your downvotes have NOTHING to do with CTR. You stated you want the entire left annihilated from the history books. That right there is the type of thinking that only increases the divide. It&#39;s not a healthy way to look at people. I am left, and I in no way want to annihilate anyone just because they are right wing. That&#39;s like saying I want Christianity and all Christians wiped from history because the Westboro Baptist Church pickets soldiers&#39; funerals. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s impossible to tell though, isn&#39;t it? I&#39;m not out there marching in the streets but I am very concerned that nobody seems have to have the slightest idea what his actual policies are going to be. &quot;He&#39;s gonna build the wall. No he&#39;s not gonna build a wall he only said that to get votes.&quot; and so on. </p>

<p>I think what matters most here is who he picks to serve on his cabinet since they will most likely be the actual decision makers during his term. Trump seems to be more of a figurehead than a political playmaker.  </p>

<p>Rumor has it that Ben &quot;pyramids were grain silos&quot; Carson is a potential pick for secretary of education. Can&#39;t be a good omen. </p>

He also released the old taxes and changed the narrative for weeks. I&#39;m just saying he only cares about winning and getting what he wants. If keeping the Clintons out of jail to enslave them because he has their dirt will win him the game he would do it. I am okay with this. I believe the end justifies the means. Some do not agree with this but I do.</p>

<p>What are the ends? Who knows. Maybe he wants to conquer the whole world. Maybe he actually wants to help America. With Clinton I knew she hated this country. With Trump it&#39;s a coin toss and that is better odds than Clinton gave me. Only time will tell.</p>

<p>I have no doubt that Hillary was the face of a more publicly known effort for globalization, I&#39;m truly curious what angle do you think Trump would be  playing?</p>

<p>It&#39;s definitely a coin toss, one I hope ends up in our favor, but I&#39;m really doubting he&#39;d make any attempt to conquer the world, especially at his advanced age.  If he achieved that within a few years, he might actually deserve it, lol.  Don&#39;t get me wrong, I am seriously interested to know your thoughts. </p>

<p>I&#39;m truly curious what angle do you think Trump would be playing?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>He is a narcissist. He wanted to be president because he thinks he is better than everyone else and can do the job better. I genuinely believe that&#39;s all it is.</p>

<p>I think he will be good for America, he will get illegals out, and he will slow down the crawl of globalism. Or they will all work together to destroy America because we elected him. One or the other.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Edit:  Good conversation, BTW- I look forward to your response!</p>

<blockquote>
<p>He is a narcissist. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;m not under the belief that he is.  I know that people keep saying this, but I&#39;ll vehemently disagree that even his public persona does not demonstrate any narcissistic tendencies.</p>

<p>I&#39;m, of course, referring to the textbook narcissist, not the internet colloquial narcissist.  I know that arguing that Trump is not a narcissist may seem unconventional and irrational, but just hear me out.  </p>

<p>The first cue that somebody may be a narcissist is their inability to handle criticism.  Since they have no ability to self-reflect, any critique, serious or no, will reward you with anger and often times vindictive behavior.  Even the slightest damage to their ego will result in fury of an inappropriate level.  Part of Trump&#39;s charm is his ability to make fun of himself, and not take himself seriously.  This by itself may demonstrate an ability to adapt and overcome narcissism, but my understanding is that it&#39;s incredibly rare.  </p>

<p>Second, narcissists believe that their way is right, and people around them should simply accept it.  Narcissist, naturally, find their way into management, but don&#39;t usually last very long.  This is usually because they hire people who worship them with compliments, rather than properly evaluating their competence.  Trump has demonstrated that he is quite capable of hiring and calling on people of competence rather than appearance.</p>

<p>I would argue, however, that Hillary is a classic narcissist.  All of the signs are there, especially her complete failure to understand what has happened and why since the election results.  She would have been the end of America.  Even if Trump rapes our economy, and fails to deliver his promises, we at least dodged a major bullet there.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not arguing that you are wrong, I just wouldn&#39;t let his public personality get in the way of valid skepticism.  He is most definitely not a classic narcissist- somewhat egotistical, maybe, but definitely not mentally handicapped by self-absorption.  </p>

<p>It&#39;s a good point but Trump might just be used to criticism from being in the limelight for 30 years. He also never lets things go and I think he does react to criticism.</p>

<p>The woman is a career self promoter with a huge ego, but she isn&#39;t hell bent on ruining the country like you Trumpies have decided she is. She just wants to rig the system to make herself look good. </p>

<p>It&#39;s still a scummy thing to do, but if she&#39;s rigging the system to make herself look good, that means she&#39;d be inadvertently trying to improve the country to make herself look good as the president. </p>

<p>What point would it serve if she got elected, said &quot;hahaha I&#39;m evil you idiots&quot; and started destroying the country? Everyone would hate her, which is the opposite of what she craves</p>

<p>I could go on, but I&#39;m sure you already have pocket notes for why these obviously racist and/or hate inciting things have been misconstrued by the #crooked MSM </p>

<p>Your casual and dismissive response that Trump is better than Hillary, particularly contextualized as a response to <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/5cy60t/dear_rthe_donald_stop_using_this_sub_to_promote/da0lfd0/">this comment about vote/content manipulation on this subreddit</a>, without providing any support for your assertion or any other sign of critical thinking whatsoever, is &quot;smug&quot;, &quot;uncritical&quot;, and comes off as seemingly &quot;satisfied&quot; with the outcome. Making you complacent. </p>

<p>You&#39;re <em>dangerously</em> complacent because of the context of the comment to which you responded - writing off vote/comment manipulation in an &quot;ends justify the means&quot;-style one-liner that is, and I repeat, devoid of any critical thinking whatsoever. It&#39;s your comment that isn&#39;t &quot;relative&quot; to the conversation, not mine.</p>

<p>So, by that logic I can post 19 fake stories and 1 real one? The point of a post shouldn&#39;t be to purposefully mislead, or push an agenda. It should be a well-reasoned, semi-plausible conspiracy. Spirit cooking, definitely doesn&#39;t fall into that category.</p>

<p>The point you are making is that I can&#39;t have had a high standard, and further that point by saying r/politics has a low standard, thereby I have to lower my standards everywhere?

    <div class="md"><p>Well first off, there was plenty of reason for people to see spirit cooking and Hillarys campaign chair and then an exact definition of spirit cooking posted on reddit by the very host inviting the Podestas to partake in a spirit cooking, and say wtf, we want answers.</p>

<p>And secondly, what I am saying is that for a sub that is a little nutty by nature, r/conspiracy should not be held to the same standard as r/politics. r/conspiracy&#39;s whole role is to take a look at often limited evidence,  make educated guesses, and discuss it to either debunk the evidence or bring light to it in hopes that more evidence can be collected. Wikileaks was/is an exhaustive amount of evidence pointing to a number of possibly huge conspiracy theories that just happen to be very beneficial to the Trump campaign. If there was, or rather when there is an exhaustive amount of evidence handed out to the public about Trump, r/conspiracy will surely pour over it like wild.</p>

<p>r/politics on the other hand by definition is supposed to be discussion on the governance of a country, not propaganda supported by a multi-million dollar campaign.</p>

<p>You are disgusted with r/conspiracy for doing what conspiracy theorists, by definition, inherently do. If you are not more disgusted by r/politics behaving in a way counter to its very definition then you are creating a double standard and you are a hypocrite.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Some of my favorite conspiracies have evidence. Even circumstantial evidence. The idea that Trump is working with the Russians is mainstream media propaganda. I mean, there&#39;s a conspiracy there, but it&#39;s not the one you want.</p>

<p>If you watch Russian media, they&#39;re super critical of Obama&#39;s actions in the middle East, so by extension, they criticize Hillary. A bunch of them thought Trump &quot;looks more presidential&quot; as well, make what you want of that.</p>

<p>Trump working with the Russians isn&#39;t a conspiracy theory to me because it doesn&#39;t explain anything. He&#39;s be more likely to work with China or India. That&#39;s where the money is.</p>

<p>Because she wants to impose a no-fly zone over a country that specifically asked Russia for military assistance.  What was she going to do, shoot down Russian planes flying over a country that asked for Russian help?  What right did she think she had to go sticking her nose in a sovereign country&#39;s airspace?  Putin said she would bring about a world war because she is a neoconservative warhawk.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, <em>someone</em> got their hands on the Podesta and DNC emails. So either some group with decent hacking chops supports Trump and was selectively leaking to support him, or two such groups leaked them very close together.</p>

<p>Now, the obvious culprit is Russia; they could do it, they have motive (Clinton was strongly anti-Russian.) As someone pointed out upthread, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/5b013v/reddit_users_declare_war_on_hillarys_paid/d9kotxa/">there&#39;s evidence</a> paid Russian trolls (which we know are a thing) were pushing Trump on Reddit. The Russian state media also seem distinctly pro-Trump.</p>

<p>Several <a href="http://motherboard.vice.com/en_uk/read/all-signs-point-to-russia-being-behind-the-dnc-hack">cybersecurity firms</a> claimed that the techniques used to hack the DNC were charictaristic of the Russian government.</p>

<p>Some emails had metadata in Cyrillic saying they had been edited, and typos in Cyrillic (probably attributable to the spellcheck automatically altering them); this doesn&#39;t prove the text was deliberately modified, but it does show that someone using a Russian-language computer was fiddling with the files. </p>

<p>Meanwhile, &quot;Guccifer 2.0&quot; has made numerous mistakes suggesting they&#39;re lying about their identity. They claimed to be Romanian, but spoke only a little broken Romanian. Their english notably improves when discussing politics, suggesting there&#39;s an english-speaking political expert there working as part of a team, rather than a lone individual.</p>

<p>It&#39;s possible that US intelligence is lying, or has evidence it&#39;s Russia that they don&#39;t want to disclose (NSA?), but it&#39;s also possible they looked at all this and went &quot;duh, clearly Russia&quot;.</p>

There is no place that spoke positively of him, so people got together and made it their safe space. Reddit is liberal as fuck along with the rest of the media. All I read was trump hate in basically every sub. Hell r/politics (a default sub) was fueled on trump hate. You guys are delusional and so far separated from the majority of America.

You also have to admit t_d is just as guilty as ignoring their own candidates scandals as much as <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a>.</p>

<p>You guys have really lost your minds at this point.</p>

<p>His refusal to put his business in a <em>real</em> blind trust, his refuse to disclose his tax returns, and his seeking security clearances for his kids are far greater conflicts of interest than anything Clinton has been accused of. He&#39;s surrounding himself with the very people he said he&#39;ll remove from Washington. He&#39;s been going around in interviews walking all of his promises back -- the wall, repealing Obamacare, everything. He&#39;s not going to do a single thing he campaigned on. He&#39;ll spend the next 4 years being an establishment pawn. And you&#39;re still going to be roaming these subs, still finding <em>some</em> new crazy way to defend him.</p>

People who supported Trump realized the media and other organizations are conspiring against him quite obviously, then found this subreddit a place to discuss that.

<p>I mean, considering Trump is a human meme (even in the 80s he was more or less a WWF villian) he got the exact type of coverage he needed to cruise into victory (always front and center for debates). Even if the general election was 50/50, the media handed Trump that 50/50 shot on a silver platter, far from conspiring against him.</p>

Once people caught on to the fact that the founding mods were already mods of the_donald and had their own agenda they unsubscribed and all that was left was the altright group. They used the guise of protesting bias to draw people in order to legitimize themselves and help smokescreen their own bias.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Trump used the quote, &quot;Drain the swamp in Washington.&quot;, when asked about removing corruption. The term originally is implied with removing the breeding grounds for mosquitoes. During the primaries he was basically calling out everyone in the RNC that was involved. Now he is assigning all the people he once said contributed to the swampiness, i.e. swamp men, to his staff. Additionally, today he announced some of the Bush Era administration that was attributed to the war in Iraq being considered.</p>

<p>The whole conspiracy movement is a fictitious movement of the right wing to invent reptilians and satanic circles, to distract from actual out in the open conspiracies. The real power in this world is money and corporates rules that world. r/conspiracy just helped elect the most elite inner circle President the US has ever seen.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Part of the justification for the war that the Bush administration put in place was the concept of &quot;enemy combatants&quot;. By reclassifying the terrorists Bush was able to use a possibly illegal loophole to not give the same rights as enemy soldiers would receive. This is what they used to justify waterboarding and Gitmo. Obama inherited these rules and never got rid of them. </p>

<p>Later the US government learned of American citizens that were terrorists. And they wanted to launch a drone strike on them, which is tantamount to an assassination, no matter how you rephrase it. But they were Americans and afforded all rights of citizens. And for obvious reasons the US government can&#39;t just kill its own citizens. And born citizens cannot be stripped of their citizenship by the government, even if they&#39;re terrorists. But by saying they were enemy combatants they were able to justify them being enemy soldiers and thus valid military targets.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Personally, I&#39;m going to wait and see what he does because I was colossally wrong about one of my conspiracies that the election was rigged, and that Trump wouldn&#39;t be allowed to win by TPTB (all of whom were pushing Clinton).</p>

<p>Look, guys... it&#39;s the easiest thing in the world to sit back and say, &quot;he&#39;s as corrupt as the rest of them.&quot; It&#39;s a lot harder having high standards for politicians. But this election gave me hope that people DON&#39;T blindly trust politicians without one iota of critical thinking because it that was the case, Clinton would&#39;ve been elected in spite of her being a corrupt criminal. </p>

<p>I personally am going to give Trump a chance. I didn&#39;t vote for him (or anyone), but I have nothing to lose from it, since the guy&#39;s already in office. Some things do give me concern like his transition team and appointees, but let me see what he actually does, because thus far, the Time Warner/Comcast merger is falling apart, the TPP fell apart, Canada and Mexico invite NAFTA&#39;s renegotiation, I feel relieved knowing we might stop bombing the shit out of Syria and the Midd East... I&#39;m cautiously optimistic.</p>

<p>This election made me realize I&#39;m not good at predicting the future, so when it comes to Trump as president I&#39;m going to simply answer &quot;I don&#39;t know yet.&quot;</p>

<p>Maybe we&#39;re on a similar cusp when it comes to the iron-clad grip of the banks/corporate rule that&#39;s been going on for centuries in this country. I like to hope so, and I think our social climate is ripe for such change. All of the signs are there.</p>

<p>I can see how that would appear like he&#39;s their enemy, but I simply think its because they believe Hilary would be more competent at carrying out their agenda, not that Trump would ever seriously consider taking them on when he is so deeply embedded in the current system.</p>

<p>The guy openly bragged about buying politicians like Hilary in the past and we&#39;re supposed to believe he&#39;s not going to be corrupt?</p>

<p>Trump just has incredibly little experience in anything like the job. No matter what your world view, experience still counts for a lot. Trumps inexperience just means he&#39;ll be leaning more heavily on the insiders he&#39;s surrounding himself with to make decisions for him, though he&#39;ll call it &quot;delegation&quot;.</p>

<p>He&#39;s already packing his staff with GOP regulars and corporate lobbyists. Look at how Wallstreet has reacted to his election. Those are the only two signals you need to see whether he&#39;s going to challenge the establish order or just carry on the way things are whilst doing a few token gestures (like building a few hundred miles of <del>wall</del> fence) and pretending to be some radical changemaker</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Your perspective is totally valid, and may be exactly what ends up happening. </p>

<p>The counter perspective is that experience in politics hasn&#39;t necessarily been <em>good</em> experience. The life-long politicians haven&#39;t made for the best presidents. Trump&#39;s run several hundred successful companies (and 5 that declared bankruptcy, yes) and has amassed billions doing it. If he leverages that wealth of managerial experience managing huge projects/companies to reduce our $19 trillion deficit, and makes life easier for Americans via job creation, lowered taxes, better healthcare, and better infrastructure, and negotiate better trade deals then great. Big business doing well does not necessarily have to be synonymous with being terrible for Americans. His policies are not perfect and is not my ideal political platform (which would consist of things like slashing military spending, investing in clean energy, single payer healthcare, etc), but his isn&#39;t a BAD platform, either. I can survive four years of it easily, if he does what he says.</p>

<p>As to Wall Street, the market initially nose dived when he took office (peso is still recovering), but it stabilized when he arguably showed he wasn&#39;t going to be a total wildcard since markets hate unpredictability. </p>

<p>Anyway, I again stress that in 4 years I might look back on this post and say, &quot;wow, I was an idiot for thinking things could be different.&quot; But hey, I felt like an idiot (but was so happy to be proven wrong) when Trump won because I thought the election was rigged to render that impossible. Maybe your judgment&#39;s proven much better than mine so that you&#39;re more confident in your views. But mine hasn&#39;t so I&#39;m waiting to see. </p>

<p>Sure, I don&#39;t think anyone who&#39;s ever made it that far is ever going to seriously challenge the system. There&#39;s too many filtering mechanisms to stop someone ever getting to that point. Even if they go in with the best of intentions there&#39;s a million compromises big and small they have to make to get that kind of power.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Contrary to Trumps hype, the vast majority of the wealth he has made is from speculating in real estate with inherited money, and by bribing/negotiating with politicians to grant him permission to build that he then subcontracts out. He takes advantages of all kind of tax/debt loopholes that people without millions of dollars imply can&#39;t afford to. He does not want a level economic playing field. He&#39;s proud to pay no income tax for 18 years whilst some schmo on 10k a year pays 15%. In his mind that&#39;s smart, not corrupt or unfair.</p>

<p>There&#39;s also many cases of him fucking over contractors by refusing to pay and then using his superior wealth and ability to sustain prolonged lawsuits to fuck them out of the money.</p>

<p>Compare how much money his subcontractors have made from actually constructing his buildings compared to how much he&#39;s made from all the speculating and deals with government and debt write offs to see what kind of capitalism he&#39;s an advocate of.</p>

<p>He&#39;s the exact opposite of a Elon Musk type billionaire who made his money from creating valuable things. Trump considers himself a success if he uses a bankruptcy to get out of millions of dollars he owes, or buys up property that triples in value without him having to do anything to it. He doesn&#39;t care whether he&#39;s helping other people or profiting at their expense. Big chunks of the financial sector will love him for that since he&#39;ll be fine with maximizing growth and debt, and we may get a short term bubble out of it but long term it will be more boom and bust. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I felt the exact same as you. I spent the entire election cycle trying to read and disseminate Wikileaks as much as possible to warn voters what they were getting if they voted for her. I paid zero attention to Trump because my rationale was, &quot;we survived Bush and he surely can&#39;t be worse than that.&quot;</p>

<p>Then after the guy got elected I went back to learn more about him, and was happy to learn I actually don&#39;t hate most of his policies. And if he doesn&#39;t execute on them then my standards are still so low that it won&#39;t matter too much.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>To be fair, if we follow the money we&#39;d see one candidate who was basically a prostitute for donors (no matter how corrupt, like Saudi Arabia) and a guy whose campaign was almost entirely self-financed by either himself, or small-medium donors. </p>

<p>I&#39;ll have to try and find as much info about the SuperPACs and large donors that comprised of roughly 18% of his campaign dollars, but generally, his campaign financing makes me trust him more, not less. </p>

<p>Edit: Just looked at those donors and they&#39;re really quite boring: real estate groups, lawyers, etc. Then you look at Clinton and see that Soros contributed a whopping $10 mil, and, well...</p>

Americans love to fight. All real Americans love the sting and clash of battle. When you were kids, you all admired the champion marble shooter, the fastest runner, the big-league ball players and the toughest boxers. Americans love a winner and will not tolerate a loser. Americans play to win all the time. That&#39;s why Americans have never lost and will never lose a war. The very thought of losing is hateful to Americans. Battle is the most significant competition in which a man can indulge. It brings out all that is best and it removes all that is base.</a></p>

<p>Americans lost Vietnam.  So badly, that a president pardoned everyone who bailed because the war was so stupid.  I&#39;m planning on getting out before there&#39;s a draft for another stupid one, because I&#39;m actually not a little boy, unfortunately.  I don&#39;t want to get drafted.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m going to double post just to make sure you see this.</p>

<p>The &quot;attached image on this one&quot; is... a photo of two women and a girl eating pizza. It is entitled &quot;pizza.jpg&quot; and the main message states, &quot;As John said, it doesn&#39;t get any better than this.&quot;</p>

<p><a href="/u/SonofaBear5">/u/SonofaBear5</a> would have us believe that &quot;pizza&quot; is actually some kind of sick pedophile code for the little girl, and that presumably the actual pizza is only in the image for reasons of plausible deniability. However, I was curious about <em>why</em> this picture was being shared, so I did a little detective work.</p>

<p>The e-mail was sent by &quot;<a href="mailto:doug@presidentclinton.com">doug@presidentclinton.com</a>&quot;, who appears to be Clinton staffer <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doug_Band">Doug Band</a>. This was important, because image-searching for Doug Band allowed me to identify the two adults in the picture - <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laura_Ling">Laura Ling</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euna_Lee">Euna Lee</a>, a pair of American journalists who were captured by North Korea and released after negotiations with Bill Clinton on August 4, 2009, for which Band was present.</p>

<p>Google image searching for &quot;Euna Lee&quot; reveals that the child is in fact <a href="http://news.uga.edu/releases/article/lee-lings-mcgill-medal/">Lee&#39;s daughter Hana</a>. And the email is dated August 8th.</p>

<p>This is a photograph of a little girl enjoy a celebratory meal with her mother, who mere days ago was rescued from a North Korean prison, shared by one of the people who made that rescue possible. And you&#39;re claiming it as evidence that those people are actually running a child sex trafficking ring.</p>

<p>This is the danger of politically-motivated investigations. You weren&#39;t &quot;investigating&quot;  the Podesta e-mails to find out the truth, you were investigating them to find dirt on Clinton. For every question you asked, you &quot;investigated&quot; until you found an answer you liked, then stopped investigating instead of double-checking to make sure the answer was actually true. If you&#39;d genuinely been looking for the truth, it would have taken you five minutes on Google to realize what that photo really was.</p>

<p>The e-mail was sent by &quot;<a href="mailto:doug@presidentclinton.com">doug@presidentclinton.com</a>&quot;, who appears to be Clinton staffer <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doug_Band">Doug Band</a>. This was important, because image-searching for Doug Band allowed me to identify the two adults in the picture - <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laura_Ling">Laura Ling</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euna_Lee">Euna Lee</a>, a pair of American journalists who were captured by North Korea and released after negotiations with Bill Clinton on August 4, 2009, for which Band was present.</p>

<p>Google image searching for &quot;Euna Lee&quot; reveals that the child is in fact <a href="http://news.uga.edu/releases/article/lee-lings-mcgill-medal/">Lee&#39;s daughter Hana</a>. And the email is dated August 8th.</p>

<p>This is a photograph of a little girl enjoy a celebratory meal with her mother, who mere days ago was rescued from a North Korean prison, shared by one of the people who made that rescue possible.</p>

<p>I have a friend who went to school with a guy who got arrested for violently raping a 13 year old.

He hung out with him in class a lot and was really chocked from hearing the news.</p>

<p>The worst part about that story is that that was the seventh guy or so. So she&#39;s been with six other elderly guys, that girl must&#39;ve been through hell. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>my quick summary/response...</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I say always start with the Wikileaks. Podesta discussing awkward &quot;pizza-related&quot; things in emails, they mention &quot;spirit cooking&quot;, and the parties at &quot;Comet Ping Pong&quot;.</p>

<p>From there you can easily link to James Alefantis for Comet Ping Pong. see his incriminating instagram posts discussing pedophilia. Besta is right next to Alefantis&#39; two businesses, and they had a distinguishable pedophile symbol in their logo, and have connections to an orphanage.</p>

<p>There right there is enough to gross any decent human being out. So shills, naive-nay-sayers, random trolls, welcome to #pizzagate. it&#39;s fucking sick, and anyone who idly sits by not helping should do the world a favor step aside and shut up.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>A well-put summary that hits the major beats in the case.  </p>

<p>I&#39;m generally a pretty skeptical person, so I&#39;m not inclined to believe interpretations from either side - TPTB/MSM or conspiracy sites/alt news/etc.  </p>

<p>Whenever &quot;satanic pedophile rings&quot; come up, my skepticism gets cranked up to 11. I think the whole &quot;spirit cooking&quot; thing is stupid bullshit that weakens the other more disturbing allegations. I mean, it sounds like Podesta attended a &quot;spirit cooking&quot; event by that macabre performance artist lady, but I do believe that&#39;s all it is - a weird experiential art piece. I&#39;m an atheist who is attracted exclusively to adult women, and my apartment is full of creepy Norwegian troll sculptures, I have a framed monster eye sculpture on my wall, I like to go to intense extreme haunted houses... and creepy taste =\= occult childfucker. I don&#39;t think we have any basis to say Podesta is worshiping demons.  </p>

<p>Having said that, when you get the <em>obvious</em> innocuous stuff out of the way, there is definitely some legitimately shady looking stuff. Those instagram accounts give me the most pause. I agree they give me a terrible feeling. But that&#39;s what it is - a feeling, primed by an existing interpretation I was already privy to.  </p>

<p>I think there could be something horrible here. But the constant talk of undeniable proof is just as closed-minded as the average zealot. We need more investigation, less posts with BREAKING or CONFIRMED or PROOF in the title (unless something is legitimately confirmed), and definitely less people getting their undies in a knot over a stupid fucking performance artist.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Lol pizzagate? That entire thing trump supporters made up because they desperately wanted dirt on Hilary and her friends. It&#39;s pathetic that they take anything and everything out of context to make it fit into a puzzle they want.</p>

<p>They (4chan /pol/, <a href="/r/the_donald">/r/the_donald</a>) saw <a href="https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/10037">this email</a> which has <a href="https://i.imgur.com/oRY5ETu.jpg">this image (named pizza.jpg)</a> attached and jumped to Podesta/Clinton are involved in a sex cult/child trafficking and this image is showing off the &quot;goods.&quot; They see the &quot;doesn&#39;t get any better than this&quot; as referring to the little girl.</p>

<p>This is related to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2009_imprisonment_of_American_journalists_by_North_Korea">Bill Clinton saving</a> the two women in this photo from North Korea. The image in question is of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laura_Ling">Laura Ling</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euna_Lee">Euna Lee</a> and a daughter belonging to one of them eating pizza together. What they mean is that their jobs don&#39;t get any better than reuniting a family by saving people from North Korea. Apparently they were sent this photo after the fact and shared it amongst themselves.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s another <a href="https://i.imgur.com/859zZuU.png">photo</a> of them getting off the plane from North Korea and seeing the daughter and the husband.</p>

<p>They turned the Clintons using their influence to save journalists from North Korea and reuniting a family at the end of it into the Clintons are involved in child trafficking. </p>

<p>They then decided that all pizza related words in the emails are code for child trafficking and continued digging and came up with other innocuous things and construed them similarly, connected it all together.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>k. The fact that every establishment in the world was against him is enough for me to know they didn&#39;t want him. Did he lie to get the presidency? Probably 1000 times. But that&#39;s not why I voted him in. I voted him in to slow them down and cause them problems. I wanted him to slow down the left. He will and that is enough for me to be happy about him over Clinton. He won barely in the end because he flanked them in WI MI and they couldn&#39;t win even with FL being stolen. This is the only reason they failed. He went up to MI where they had not put in preparations to steal because they are blue states and they didn&#39;t have time. He came in at the last moment and beat them. Will he be a good pres? Who knows. Did the elite want him? No. Hell no. That&#39;s enough for me.</p>

<p>In Hillary&#39;s emails they said Trump was easy to beat so they asked their surrogates in the media to pump him up to knock out the republicans they couldn&#39;t beat. In the general it was nonstop attacks from those same surrogates. It&#39;s in the emails.</p>

<p>I&#39;m thinking we&#39;ll probably need this place after Trump has a chance to affect free press and speech laws though, so I want to try to help keep it as unbiased as possible while I still can.</p>

<p>The best method I&#39;ve found is just to be as nice as you can, and break down your logic as clearly as possible to limit counterarguments or picking apart answers.  </p>

<p>It still gets depressing having to deal with all the insults and disgusting people though.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Shit, I had someone, I think on this sub tell me that &quot;at least trump isn&#39;t an oligarch&quot;...</p>

<p>bitch, he is the exact definition of an oligarch. A rich businessman, from a rich family who uses his money for political power. He has paid bribes, and used eminent domain to gain more money/power...he has been in the know with many in the political field, and now he is in line for the presidency.</p>

<p>dude&#39;s an oligarch.</p>

<p>Peter Thiel has shown no previous interest in Trump, in the Republican party or in any of the policies Trump advocates (Thiel is actually a libertarian/anarcho-capitalist not a protectionist nationalist), but he donates a million dollars to Trumps campaign, then gets invited to speak at one of his rallies and suddenly he has a position on Trumps transition team.</p>

<p>I&#39;m shocked at how many people who complained about elites buying political influence seemed totally on board with Trump just outright trying to buy his way into power rather than bribing someone already in power.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>yea pence is a pretty underwhelming VP choice anyways. Offers nothing to the ticket since he was guaranteed the evangelical vote anyways, and Indiana is a red state. </p>

<p>And the fact that he&#39;s only considering establishment republicans for important cabinet positions proves that he&#39;s not anti-establishment. If he wanted to &quot;drain the swamp,&quot; maybe you shouldn&#39;t tell your voter base to re-elect the incumbent GOPer instead of alt-right congresspeople, and maybe you shouldn&#39;t only consider establishment GOPers for your cabinet. But I voted third party, so what do I know?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thank you <a href="/u/The_In-Betweener">/u/The_In-Betweener</a> for making this thread which shouldn&#39;t even have been created in the first place if the situation of this subreddit wasn&#39;t as bad as it is now. I respect that some users are also Donald Trump supporters but they shouldn&#39;t brigade this subreddit which was meant as a free-thinking space. Everyone can criticise everything if they can bring up proofs or elements of proof and arguments. Noone is sacred and untouchable for real <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> users. If you can&#39;t understand this simple notion then you&#39;re not a &quot;free-thinker&quot; and <a href="/r/The_Donald">/r/The_Donald</a> should be more appropriate for you.</p>

<p>Also I&#39;d like to hear from the mods

    <div class="md"><p>I haven&#39;t seen what you&#39;re claiming here, OP, you&#39;re projecting.</p>

<p>I&#39;m looking at the front page of this subreddit right now and I only see one post talking about Obama deporting more illegals than Trump is saying he will, and one other post asking why Clinton hasn&#39;t denounced the anti-Trump riots, both of which don&#39;t sound like it&#39;s promoting either candidate.</p>

<p>It sounds like the mods haven&#39;t gotten any reports of what you claim either, because they haven&#39;t said any thing. </p>

<p>Could you provide an example of what you&#39;re speaking about? Pretty sure that the mods will or would typically remove a post that doesn&#39;t fit this subreddit or belong here.</p>

<p>His stance on climate change is absurd. I don&#39;t understand why people would want to even deny it. Even if climate change was just made up, why wouldn&#39;t we want to pursue renewable resources instead of mining the earth for its remaining stock of oil? Guy wants to put coal back on the map when it&#39;s a dying industry. There&#39;s no money in it for the long run. I don&#39;t understand why a business man wouldn&#39;t want to make a better long term investment. </p>

<p>Baffling. Everyone protesting is scared of their civil rights going away. That&#39;ll never happen. The people won&#39;t let it happen. But humanity dying is going to happen and no one seems to really be protesting that aspect.</p>

As I said, I&#39;m interested in his potential and never expected him to fix everything, I hope you didn&#39;t misinterpret my comment to think that, as I&#39;m not sure where I stated that. Feel free to support the guy all you want but I recommend not blindly follow him. Learn to think critically for yourself. </p>

<p>There are some things I have hope for. Congressional term limits are a plus. Hopefully the guy knows how to make money and can stimulate the economy, but putting it into resources that damage the earth and put our ability to survive on it at very high risk is as I said before; absurd. It might make him look good in the short term with temporarily increased profits and jobs, but it will not fair well for us long term. The earth is at <a href="http://www.livescience.com/55469-2016-could-be-hottest-year-on-record.html">record high temperatures</a>. Climate change isn&#39;t some insane liberal agenda people are trying to push on conservatives to scare children into being hippies. It is a scientific fact. This is the fate of humanity. And for a world leader to be idiotically opposed to it is fucking retarded. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>To be fair to r/the_donald, they have been more on top of a lot of conspiracy information than r/conspiracy has at times. While there is a very obvious bias towards Trump on that sub, the vast majority of topics were about things that had little to do with Trump himself, rather disproving things said in the MSM, or trying to expose Soros, even going through all the wikileaks emails trying to piece together the pizzagate pedophile stuff. </p>

<p>So I get where you are coming from here, but r/conspiracy has more in common with r/the_donald than you think. </p>

If you simply post a comment on the_donald, you will be instantly banned from many other subreddits. It doesn&#39;t matter what you said in your comment, you are instantly banned from many other subreddits because of it. Many of those subreddits are ones controlled by CTR(or were) along with the infiltration and subversion of Reddit in general. Look to the Warrant Canary being removed this year as obvious proof. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You need to understand that I already understand reddit and social media in general. We aren&#39;t talking about what happens in other subs. We are talking about what happens in this sub and the trump sub. The trump sub does not allow for dissenters and SJW, it says it right there in their rules section. So that means they have an agenda. This place was never meant to have a political agenda because the majority here are apolitical. So you can&#39;t point fingers at other subs and blame them, while turning the blind eye to the Trump sub and ignoring their posted rules, while trying to justify the takeover here.

<p>They were in a war trying to elect who they thought was the best chance at saving the US. If that meant banning shills/dissenters/SJW&#39;s to keep the boards as clean as possible to promote their message than so be it. Like I said, they are biased towards their candidate and did what needed to be done. </p>

<p>As for what I originally said, I give them credit for talking about things not being discussed anywhere else on Reddit, even on this sub. The majority of posts were not so much about Trump, but about conspiracies in the MSM, in government, in globalism/NWO, in Secret societies, in spirit cooking and international pedophilia rings etc...</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know whether you are a shill or just an impassioned r/conspiracy nut concerned with the sub...but I would be happy with the_donald as I have seen more people wake up to the realities of the world there than anywhere else in my decade long adventure into the belly of the conspiracy beast. </p>

<p>As for giving them credit, well, there was absolutely nothing I saw in the sub that wasn&#39;t discussed here, in depth, with a bit more insight. Even if what you are saying is true, what does that have to do with pushing a political agenda <em>here</em>?</p>

<p>And I don&#39;t know if <strong>you</strong> are a shill, a trump deepthroater, or the man on the moon. What does any of that have to do with infiltrating this sub and making it the_Donald 2.0? </p>

<p>I have been trying to give this sub a chance to redeem itself, and every time I am more and more disappointed. Just look at the recent threads regarding wikileaks and the international pedo rings. I see more comments that are what I would expect from a Huffington Post comment section than I do anything relatively conspiracy related. Seriously...it is fucking depressing. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t believe we are going to decide the leadership of the most advanced country on the planet by filling in bubbles next to names on a piece of paper. What I do realize is that in this rigged system we have to go with what we are given. Do we want immediate war with Russia leading to WWIII by electing Hillary Clinton who was the only candidate for a no fly zone over Syria? Or do we want an &quot;outsider&quot; who might possibly change things up a bit. </p>

<p>There are no good choices here, and I don&#39;t think for one second that Donald Trump couldn&#39;t be compromised by the elites, but he is our best shot right now. </p>

<p>As far as a political based subreddit is concerned, the_donald was as far from politically centered as anything I have ever seen. Everyone about it has been for the most part upbeat and positive with a bias more towards conspiracy than politics. </p>

<p>This is where you are wrong. Your falling into the trap of letting something or someone choose for you by allowing yourself to be convinced that your choice is limited. That&#39;s how authoritarian systems work. They create the perception of limited choice so they can manipulate the masses between the choices they create.</p>

<p>The fact of the matter is you do have a choice, you can refuse to consent to a system that has been proven time and time again that it will do what is in the best interest of the TPTW the same choice you would have if you ran a company that was taken over by corrupt individuals. Refuse to consent and take you money and support elsewhere.
Everybody that claims they have lack of choice is just deciving themselves because they don&#39;t want to let go of the ship that has protected them for so long. The ship is sinking, just let go, you don&#39;t need to be pulled under by the weight of false choice.</p>

The problem is that poltics is an agenda that most of us no longer consent to. We know that is designed to disempower people regardless of the candidate. The question is are you going to align yourself with truth, or a political figure head designed to steal the energy of truth so that it may use it for its own purposes?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>A lot of people had excessive expectations for Trump.   Trump like Obama,  knew how to pump/sell to a lot of people based on hope,  them projecting their hope for a savior on a schmuck.</p>

<p>So,  there will be a lot of let downs.   Emperors do not give up their powers,  and do not blow the cover of their secret operations.   Forget a real investigation into 9/11.    Its a national myth,  and no matter how nuts the official version is,  its like the official version of the NFL or major league baseball.    Too many people have too much invested in it.    Too many people would be sidelined for complicity if the truth came out.    But history will <strong>NOT</strong> look kindly on these megalomaniacs,  not for Pearl Harbor or Hiroshima/Nagasaki/Vietnam/Iraq etc.  which also were undertaken with duplicity,  premeditated genocide.</p>

<p>Well,  back to the subject.   Two mob factions had a war and the people they operate their racket against took sides.   Get ready to pay your protection money to the mob that won.   And celebrate the mob that lost getting whipped,  if they do get whipped.   Trump will probably pardon them,  at this rate.</p>

<p>Except they love to pretend they&#39;re free speech advocates and that liberal cucks can&#39;t handle disagreement in their safe spaces. They&#39;re hypocrites. I&#39;ve seen people in this very thread say they were there for months and were surprised they were banned the second they said something critical of trump, so clearly there&#39;s some pretending going on.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve criticized Obama as an amoral drone killer who&#39;s been worse on transparency and whistleblowing than Bush, and who had no real intention to shutdown Guantanamo because of the bad headlines it would produce, and I&#39;ve not been banned for it.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve also said Hilary is blatantly corrupt and that voting for the lesser of two evils is wrong, and I&#39;ve not been banned for it.</p>

<p>It&#39;s not the creation of a Donald Trump fan club that&#39;s hypocritical, its doing so when you call out safe spaces and liberals for not tolerating disagreement and think yourself superior somehow when you do exactly the same thing, and pretend &quot;but we&#39;re intentionally creating a Trump safe space!&quot; makes a difference.</p>

<p>That&#39;s what a safe space is. I&#39;m not sure why you think them being explicit about what they&#39;re doing makes it less hypocritical when they rave about liberals being triggered and offended by any opposing views all the time.</p>

<p>If they really believed their shit about challenging views and free speech they wouldn&#39;t want a safe space. The fact they admit that its a safe space is not relevant to that point.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Do you really not see the difference? Are you daft?</p>

<p>&quot;Safe spaces&quot; are commonly on college campuses and in places where open discussion and open minds are supposed to be encouraged. They intentionally block out the noise so their echo chamber goes undisturbed. <a href="/r/the_donald">/r/the_donald</a> members are more than willing to debate, but if they <em>allow</em> it in <a href="/r/the_donald">/r/the_donald</a> than it&#39;s going to clutter the subreddit and take away what it is about, memes and circlejerking.</p>

<p>Also, this trend was not started by <a href="/r/the_donald">/r/the_donald</a>, it was a trend started by <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a>. I have tried to debate in their multiple times or bring up an opposing viewpoint, but within seconds I&#39;m -10. <a href="/r/the_donald">/r/the_donald</a> has the choice of allowing open debate whereas <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a> does not, or they can choose to counteract one extreme with another.</p>

<p>You can call it what you want, but changing a definition or viewpoint to try and catch someone being a hypocrite doesn&#39;t make them hypocritical, it makes you a fuckin moron lol.</p>

<p>Posting this here cause this topic has some visibility... If anyone is wondering how moderators got compromised... on reddit and elsewhere... check out that topic I remember from a while back...  This is what they sent in a PM </p>

<p><strong>&quot;Thanks for responding.
I&#39;m a student at the Salt Institute in Portland studying radio documentary and am doing a story about content moderation. As of now the scope I have for the story is that I don&#39;t really think the general population has any idea that these jobs exist. Content Moderation is absolutely necessary but it&#39;s all behind the scenes and it would be interesting to learn more about it.
If you would like to talk about your experience doing some of this work it would be great if we could set up an interview wherever you&#39;d like.&quot;</strong></p>

<p>I think the tendrils went out over a year ago... I&#39;m sure there is a topic like that on about any board with a userbase. </p>

So the Deep State itself has protested radically in order to remove the Clintonian parasitic carapace from its back, in doing so it has mutilated itself, indeed left the official state essentially headless for at least 4 years. Anything is possible, all is up in the air. The main question is, does this portend more or less war for the world?</p>

<p>Have you never heard of the phrase &quot;No such thing as bad publicity&quot;? He was getting millions of dollars of free advertising from all the controversies he stirred up.</p>

<p>Even if Trump lost his fame would have been propelled to an all time high.  This a man who puts his name on every building he gets a chance to. He was planning on launching a TV network off the back of the hype if he lost.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It would make no sense for him to publicly call the MSM out on their bullshit and become an enemy of the DNC, when he could have just joined the left and had an easy ride to victory</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Trump won almost entirely based off opposing Hilary and proposing populist protectionist policies like cracking down on immigration and foreign trade. He would have never made it through DNC primaries, and he wouldn&#39;t have had a candidate so embroiled in scandal and thoroughly uncharismatic to go up against.</p>

<p>The fact Trump previously praised Clinton to high heaven and described himself as a democrat before going back on it and deciding democrats have ruined the country and Clinton is terrible tells you all you need to know about whether he believes what he says, or cares about principles more than power.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Why does he go on reality TV? It doesn&#39;t pay enough to be worth a billionaires time. Not everything is about money. The man is clearly a raving egotist. Getting your name in the list of presidents is worth about 10,000 skyscrapers with your name on it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Just curious if you knew about any of those allegations before he started his campaign, or are they just things you picked up from the year long smear campaign I mentioned? This seems to be more proof of my argument. </p>

<p>If Trump is doing everything simply to boost his ego, then why wouldn&#39;t he just take the easy rout and run as a democrat?Why risk tarnishing his name? Why put so much energy into bashing the DNC and the media when he could have easily just joined the left and had an easy ride to the top, all while being praised by the MSM? With the current political climate, nobody in their right mind would run as a republican candidate in hopes for an easy victory. </p>

<p>You say &#39;&#39;no such thing as bad publicity&#39;&#39;, but if someone could make the choice to be seen as a &#39;&#39;racist bigot homophobe child molester&#39;&#39; or &#39;&#39;an intellectual, businessman, genius&#39;&#39; ( which is how the media would have portrayed him if he was on the left) who the hell would choose the negativity? Like I said, it makes no sense that he is doing this to boost his ego. </p>

<p>Also, the whole &#39;&#39;Trump didn&#39;t pay a bunch of contractors&#39;&#39; thing I think is an oversimplification. Just one of those quick jabs people keep in their arsenal and use when the time is right.  Trump was running a multi billion dollar empire. There are alot of moving gears within businesses that large. Sometimes there are penalty claues if a person finishes a job late, or if its a shit job all together. Sometimes mistakes happen. Wasn&#39;t &#39;&#39;the list of contractors Trump didn&#39;t pay&#39;&#39; all the way back from the 80s to present day? How can someone run business that massive for that long and not have issues? </p>

<p>I could post a  list of a bunch of good things Trump has done for people, where there is no way he could have gained anything in return. Would that change your position that everything he does is motivated purely by self interest? I doubt it. You seem to be pretty set in your idea of him. </p>

<p>Would that make them not true?</p>

<p>I didn&#39;t hear about Hilary laughing about getting a child rapist off until the smear campaign against her kicked off, doesn&#39;t mean its not true. I did hear about Trump U being a scam a few years back though when the first lawsuits started coming in.</p>

<p>If this is just the natural result of having a billion dollar empire, where&#39;s Elon Musks equivalent scandals and lawsuits?  Where&#39;s his repeated bankruptcies?</p>

<p>I have a more philosophical problem with the way Trump makes his money even ignoring the allegations of fraud and breach of contract. At the very least Trump himself <del>admits to</del> brags about gaming the system, trying to pay as little tax as possible, using corporate bankruptcy to repeatedly get out of paying debts, using ties and bribes to politicians in order to get special favors. Even if all of the lawsuits against him where false, he still revels in stacking the deck in his favor using his wealth and influence. He also has a huge amount of money tied up in property speculation, instead of actually producing value. That is not the kind of businessman I admire. I admire people like Elon Musk, people who want to make money by producing things of value, not just by gaming the system. </p>

<p>Musk has far more money than Trump, started off with much less of an advantage and still hasn&#39;t a fraction of the lawsuits against him as Trump did. </p>

<p>Do you think he would have won the democratic primary on a ticket of &quot;build the wall&quot;, &quot;shutdown on muslim imigration&quot;, &quot;Obama is the founder of ISIS and btw remember when I kept asking to see his birth certificate&quot;? The birther stuff alone was enough to kill his chances at primary and election with democratic voters. </p>

<p>Trump got less votes than Romney did. Going up against someone as corrupt and uncharismatic as Hilary was a golden gift he would have lost on a democratic ticket (which he wouldn&#39;t have won anyway).</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>I don&#39;t recall saying everything he does is out of self interest. I think I said something like I don&#39;t think he ran for president out of some altruistic urge to do good, and that putting his name on everything and becoming a reality TV star are clearly about his ego. But I don&#39;t think Hilary ran for altruistic reasons either.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think the problem lies within Reddit itself. T_d is popular because it&#39;s one of the only places that doesn&#39;t constantly bash trump. So, they take it to the other extreme and praise him. 
Maybe if Reddit actually viewed Trump without hate, t_d would go away. It&#39;s the only place for his fans to really talk positives because nobody else does. Yet he won the election, so that shows the bias and even the demographic of Reddit. It&#39;s hard for this to be a place of fair discussion when it&#39;s ALL hate. It pisses me off and I&#39;m not crazy about the guy either. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Threads like this were being posted once or twice a week for months but they were always aggressively downvoted. I usually sort by &#39;new&#39; so I saw them. I guess now that Trump&#39;s won the election the funding&#39;s been cut back on the Republicans&#39; version of CTR, so the anti-Trump stuff has more chance to gain traction. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Personally I think it&#39;s a little more simple than that. The average user of <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> is 1. happy to upvote anything damning about an authority figure, regardless of the legitimacy of the story, and 2. feels threatened and oppressed by &quot;the powers that be&quot;, whomever that might be.</p>

<p>During the election Hillary represented the &quot;establishment&quot; and Trump represented the &quot;underdog&quot; here (however inaccurate that characterization may have been), so naturally the users of this sub upvoted anything damning about Hillary and ignored anything damning about Trump. Now that Hillary is out of the picture and Trump will be president, Trump now represents &quot;the powers that be&quot; so this sub has turned on him. He&#39;s now the oppressor they&#39;re looking for because he has the power, so he&#39;ll be the focus of this sub for the next 4 years. </p>

<p>To me, this is a much simpler explanation than thousands of paid shills trying to control the posts on a niche subreddit. But believe whatever you want to believe.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Way too early to offer real criticism, it&#39;s just guesswork and speculation at this point. We&#39;ll have to wait to see what he actually does in office. Even more than most people, it&#39;s going to be what he does not what he says. </p>

<p>I speculate that he is being disingenuous when he says he won&#39;t go after gay marriage and abortion rights - he won&#39;t need to do it himself if he appoints the &#39;right&#39; people to the supreme court. </p>

<p>He appoints priebus, and bannon at the same time. While priebus can be seen as a moderating influence / olive branch to the republican establishment, bannon is most certainly a giant &#39;fuck you&#39; to the establishment and doesn&#39;t bode well for the current &#39;see, he really is a moderate after all&#39; sentiment. </p>

<p>There will be some that support wikileaks now that will hate them if they ever release anything about Trump. That&#39;s just how people work, and this post isn&#39;t going to stop that. You&#39;re not that powerful.</p>

<p>What you can do is stop eating your friends and start accepting their quirks. Let us dig into what we find interesting, and eventually we&#39;ll find something you find interesting too.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, here&#39;s the good news; from what I gather from The_Donald (and I&#39;ve been active since it was at 13k subscribers), we&#39;re excited at the prospect of him being president next year. That being said, we&#39;re on our toes watching for any type of 180 that signifies that he&#39;s going to go back on his campaign promises. If he gets out of line, we&#39;ll likely be the first to speak up.</p>

<p>For example, his recent appointment of Reince Priebus to a cabinet position was scrutinized; from what we can gather, it&#39;s a case of &quot;keep your friends close, and your enemies closer&quot; to lessen a chance of rebellion from the guy. It also helps to have insiders who know the ins and outs of the corruption plaguing D.C. to assist with routing out the corruption. We absolutely plan on holding him accountable for everything he does; if he steps out of line, we&#39;ll be absolutely speak out in opposition.</p>

<p>Dealing with the corruption in Washington is a bipartisan issue.</p>

<p>Hahaha. What makes you think they&#39;re enemies? Have you been following Trump&#39;s campaign? Look here:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;He is very likely Chief of Staff,” said one person familiar with the conversations. “Trump legit listens to him.”
Priebus took on a leading role in encouraging Trump to stay on message in the final weeks of the campaign, holding multiple calls with the candidate daily since he became the presumptive nominee in May, and frequently traveling on his plane.
<em>Under Priebus’ leadership the RNC took on an unprecedented role in managing the nuts-and-bolts of Trump’s data, field, and finance operations.</em></p>

<p>Blows the mind that after everything that came from this election some people can still walk around acting like conspiracy theories are just totally impossible and that you&#39;d have to be a total retard to consider them.</p>

<p>News flash people, Trump very likely had his own version of CTR but it was probably much more organically fueled. It was clear he dominated Clinton in social media, if she could take over <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a> and have shills running amok he totally had some crazy shit going on too.</p>

<p>All these people saying <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> was used and we couldn&#39;t see it, just shut the hell up. Many saw it, many complained, and well that sort of thing is always possibility when you try to have a sub with minimal censorship.

    <div class="md"><p>I have no idea why no one is pointing this out on here. Trump just got to the Presidency while circumventing the lobbying system. The lobbying system ensures that politicians basically owe favors once they get into office. If they want to get re-elected, they have to please the special interests. This acts as a means to control politicians. Trump doesn&#39;t owe anyone any favors because his campaign was mostly self-funded. He also has billions of dollars at his disposal. The President is exempt from the conflicts of interest laws surrounding investing. This means that he can help push through legislation that deregulates certain markets that he&#39;s invested in. It wouldn&#39;t even be illegal. That would make him a ton of money. He can then funnel this money to the election campaigns of the politicians who are loyal to him. His plan is to severely limit the power of lobbyists in Washington. Good, right? No, not if the President just made a ton of money and could use that money to fund congressional election campaigns. Severely limiting the power of lobbyists would set him up to be the main financier of election campaigns. He&#39;d basically own Congress. </p>

<p>He could then push through legislation that creates congressional term limits. This would make it so that he could just wait out the members of Congress that he couldn&#39;t force out by just funding their competition&#39;s election campaigns. From there he could pass any legislation he wants or have them appoint whoever he wants to the Supreme Court. He could also impeach anyone he wants. That would get rid of any checks or balances to the President&#39;s power. He has set up a blind trust which is run by members of his own family. Usually these are used to provide some transparency with regard to the President&#39;s investments. Having your family members run it basically ensures that that information will be kept secret. This guy just found a legal loophole that he could exploit to make himself America&#39;s first dictator. We just put him in a position where he can take advantage of that loophole. We&#39;re dumb as fuuck.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Small point, but Trump didn&#39;t mostly self-fund his campaign. He donated around 25% of the total amount raised (or $66 million), some ~$10 million of which was paid back to himself and his children as reimbursement for travel expenses and use of family-owned entities like hotels and such. His PACs raised $33 million just from people writing checks of a million dollars or more, people like Robert Mercer of Rennaisance Technologies (interesting little hedge fund if you want to look into it-- the two CEOs were both top donors to the Hillary and Trump campaigns). None of that negates the rest of your post however. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I only subbed because I heard this one from my room mate a few months back when he said he was gonna leave the country. </p>

<p>Right around when that black guy sniped the two cops, the theory was that riots would be spreading. Big ones. BLM had already had a few riots, but there were going to be more. </p>

<p>Then Trump would get elected. Obviously, this did happen. We are having riots now because of this. </p>

<p>The next step is that Obama will deny the results of the election. He&#39;ll call for &quot;boots on the ground,&quot; (that term seems to be very important) and enact martial law of the country. </p>

<p>All this time, cops have been silently disarming citizens. This was kind of true. Obama did call an executive mandate for more gun control. Executive mandates don&#39;t necessarily do anything though, it&#39;s just an influential person declaring their intentions. </p>

<p>So now the nation is under military control, Obama will declare himself President for another term, any citizens who still have guns will be systematically confiscated. </p>

<p>Then things are supposed to somehow devolve into all out civil war. You either join the cops and kill people or resist and get killed. I&#39;m fuzzy on any other details. </p>

<p>Haven&#39;t heard any conspiracy like that on here since joining though... </p>

There is so much corruption, conspiracy and overall evil surrounding the Clintons and the DNC that Trump supporters are very engaged in waking people up to what is really going on.

There are overbearing and ill intented Trump supporters of course, but the majority are level headed people who appreciate facts and liberty.

Will you admit these crimes? Are you not delusional? If President elect Trump makes even a tenth of these kinds of crimes against humanity, I will be one of the first to call him out on it.

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ll explain it for you. It is ironic to say that trump supporters are delusional to the misdeeds of their candidate when Hillary Clinton is literally responsible for the death of hundreds of thousands of people and yet her supporters, like yourself, seem not to care and instead focus on unimportant things. I am not filled with hate, but you seem to be. I&#39;m mostly disappointed and disgusted with about 50% of the American public. Bring me your facts and evidence, and I will listen to you. That is how discussion works! So far, you&#39;ve literally provided nothing. Edit: After checking your post history, it is obvious you are uneducated, and in past &quot;discussions&quot; focused on unimportant grammar, while yourself making a plethora of grammatical errors. You spend your time watching and thinking about sports, and preaching to other people about how stupid they are without providing any positive reinforcement. You&#39;re a burden on all around you, and a disappointment to your family. Examine yourself closely, and maybe you will wake up. Good luck.</p>

Furthermore, their claim that Trump and Epstein <em>&quot;had no relationship&quot;</em> directly conflicts with the evidence in Epstein&#39;s address book and with Trump&#39;s own statements about their fifteen-year friendship.</p>

<p>You should keep in mind that <em>Radar Online</em> is a tabloid that has relentlessly supported Trump in the same way many other establishment publications have been backing Hillary Clinton. In its early days, it <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maer_Roshan#Career">was actually partly-financed by Epstein himself.</a></p>

<p>Around 2011-2012, <em>Radar Online</em> was purchased by <strong>American Media</strong>, headed by <a href="http://www.vanityfair.com/news/2016/09/is-the-national-enquirer-in-bed-with-donald-trump">Trump&#39;s close friend</a> David J. Pecker. </p>

<p>American Media also publishes <em>The National Enquirer</em>, which enthusiastically supported and endorsed Trump, and which leaked the information about Ted Cruz&#39;s extramarital affairs. After ownership of <em>Radar Online</em> passed to American Media, its founding staff and editors were <a href="http://investmentwatchblog.com/trump-sued-for-sex-crimes-via-epstein-here-are-the-facts-updated/">reportedly fired and replaced</a> with <em>Enquirer</em> personnel.</p>

<p>It&#39;s interesting to note that the <em>Enquirer</em> was <a href="http://dujour.com/news/national-enquirer-history-scandal/">founded by a CIA psychological warfare specialist and financed by Frank Costello, the head of the Luciano crime family, and Roy Cohn, Chief Counsel for the House Un-American Activites Committee.</a> Trump has maintained <a href="http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2016/05/donald-trump-2016-mob-organized-crime-213910">a lifelong association with the Mafia.</a> Cohn, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/1982/05/15/nyregion/notes-on-people-roy-cohn-joins-board-of-anti-communist-group.html">who sat on the advisory board</a> of <a href="http://rightweb.irc-online.org/western_goals_foundation/">the Western Goals Foundation</a>, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/06/21/us/politics/donald-trump-roy-cohn.html">was Trump&#39;s mentor.</a></p>

<p>She was accused of these things, and the Republican FBI director said she did none of these things. No charges. No indictment. Which part of that don&#39;t you understand?</p>

<p>We often let politicians off after doing illegal things, but when Clinton is accused of things, investigated, and exonerated, we blow it up.</p>

<p>Look: it is quite clear that you never would have voted for her. This requires you to exaggerate her flaws to convince yourself why you should vote for Trump.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/amp/37931552">http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/amp/37931552</a></p>

<p>Reince Priebus, Chris Christie, Jeff Sessions, Rudi Giuliani, Steven Mnuchin...yeah, sounds like a real swamp draining there.  What a complete farce.  Insiders, insiders everywhere.</p>

<p>And you know, the one making me laugh the hardest at the backflips it&#39;s going to induce in delusional Trump supporters is Steven Mnuchin.  16 years at Goldman Sachs...16 years as a Wall Street insider at one of the most corrupt banking corporations which crippled the US in &#39;07 and caused the very money crunch that Trump has referenced at every turn to fire up the working class.  How exactly can Trump supporters still claim Trump is the anti-corruption candidate with a Cabinet containing Steve Mnuchin at the head of the Treasury?  It&#39;s fucking insane.</p>

However, the good posters here research what they want to investigate and provide their own sources. With the last place they would ever need to rely on for information being   R/the_donald. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not sure if you trust the Washington Post (if not, who do you trust??) but The Washington Post interviewed a military veteran about this and debunked it here: <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2016/08/11/too-good-to-check-sean-hannitys-tale-of-a-trump-rescue/">https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2016/08/11/too-good-to-check-sean-hannitys-tale-of-a-trump-rescue/</a></p>

<p>Or why don&#39;t you try reading the Snopes article, instead of dismissing it without reading it? At least I read the dumb article that was referred to me.</p>

<p>Snopes references an interview with Lieutenant General Vernon Kondra, retired Air force.  Here&#39;s the description with background from Snopes, with his words in quotes:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>There are several references to a 1990-91 contract for Trump Shuttle to carry personnel across the United States, between the East and West Coasts, on a standard LaGuardia-Dover-Charleston-Travis-Chord-Kelly-Dover-LaGuardia run.</p>

<p>&quot;It worked very well, and the crews loved it, and really thought that we&#39;d done something special for them,&quot; Kondra recalled in the oral history. &quot;It was a helluva lot better than using 141s [cargo craft], which we could use for something else.&quot;</p>

<p>But Kondra said that the notion that Trump personally arranged to help the stranded soldiers made little sense. &quot;I certainly was not aware of that. It does not sound reasonable that it would happen like that. It would not fit in with how we did business. I don&#39;t even know of how he would have known there was a need.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think you hit the nail on the head with hopelessness/helplessness.</p>

<p>I think it might be a little bit more than that, though.  I feel like when people listen to Alex Jones spitting all over the mic, they think, &quot;Wow, this guy is really fighting for me, I guess I can keep going to my 9-5 job and drink myself to sleep every night.  No need to protest, this guy has it covered.&quot;</p>

<p>It&#39;s like they&#39;re fulfilling their urges to do something by just listening to a guy lose his shit over it.  Very similarly to the way that people will like a cause on Facebook, and then consider that their public service for the year.  Giving yourself the illusion of giving a damn.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There was a time about 15 years ago that I thought Alex Jones was speaking truth to power. His appearance in the Richard Linklater film, Waking Life, was electrifying to hear as a 16 year old beginning to question the system. It was what first put him on my radar and I started listening to his radio program so after seeing the movie. This was around 2002-2003. For a while, he seemed like he was dead right about a ton of stuff - 9/11, Iraq, Bush war crimes, mass government surveillance, police militarization etc.  Sure he was bombastic and over the top sometimes but that&#39;s why I loved him. He was nothing if not passionate and I felt like his passion was well deserved and I wished more people got as fired up about the real things as he did. </p>

<p>Then...something changed. Admittedly, I stopped listening to him as much as I got busier with life post-college. Then I see him start popping up in random youtube videos here and there a few years ago and he just looks unhinged and almost like a caricature of his old self. It&#39;s hard to describe but it just looked staged or something. And now this election cycle I see that he&#39;s got all his weight behind Donald Trump?! This is the same guy that I used to hear losing his mind when George W. Bush talked about how much easier things would be if the US was a dictatorship? He&#39;s putting his support behind a guy who routinely praises strong men and has an Authoritarian bent like no one else we&#39;ve seen in recent history? It just doesn&#39;t gel with who he used to be and what he used to stand for. </p>

<p>I&#39;m left to come to one of two conclusions: 1) Alex Jones has officially lost his mind or 2) Alex Jones is being used as a puppet by the very people he used to warn all of us about. I am inclined to think it&#39;s #1. But #2 is also an intriguing option and not one I had never considered before. I remember even thinking during the early days about how much more on edge I was and angry I was and then hopeless I felt after listening to 3 hours of Alex rail on and on about how fucked we were getting by the Elites that I actually started to think &quot;what if Alex is just a stooge put here to fill us with terror and half truths and distractions?&quot; I dunno, it&#39;s like some one else said, it&#39;s almost like a conspiracy-ception! I dismissed the notion back then, and today I still feel like the simpler answer is probably true - after walking a razors edge for so long, he just ain&#39;t right in the head any more. </p>

<p>sorry for any typos, kind of rambled more than I thought I was going to when I started. </p>

When people start to sense things aren&#39;t right, when they start wanting to dig a little deeper, there&#39;s Alex Jones ready to baffle them with bullshit and leave them more confused than when they started (and sell them a little silver bullion and fluoride filters while they&#39;re on his website).</p>

<p>Proof has a place and the culprit should always be held accountable. But sometimes a lack of evidence makes this impossible. In the case of Hillary Clinton for example with her aides deliberately colluding with the DNC to discredit Bernie.</p>

<p>Why should Hillary Clinton, who benefited extremely from this subversion not be punished? It was her aides who did this but does she hold no responsibility for this travesty whatsoever? I don&#39;t believe so. Sure the specific aides who engaged in this should be prosecuted. </p>

<p>But why shouldn&#39;t she be punished as well?????</p>

<p>She&#39;s many things...ambitions, calculating, cold, egomaniacal, narcissistic, but she&#39;s not crazy.

<p>Now?  Eh. At best he&#39;s a peddler of goods who uses fear mongering to increase his sales.</p>

<p>If Alex Jones was who he presents himself to be, going after people as powerful as he presents them to be..  why has he not died of a heart attack or suspicious robbery or something by now? </p>

<p>It&#39;s not humor anymore when it turns into into a real and systematic way of obstructing any critic against Trump, banning any one who dissent from the &quot;Trump is perfect&quot; narrative, and drowning any critic of him with whataboutism (But HRC did this, HRC is gone, so now you guys have to find other ways to defend him) and insults.
It&#39;s also telling that a lot of Trump supporters like you don&#39;t feel confortable when they are in another sub when their lord and savior can be criticized, they are too used to their safe space.</p>

<p>dark faction of citizens</p>
</blockquote>

<p>OK. Let me tell about myself , since you were being so kind in sharing your place and view of the world. </p>

<p>I live in Serbia, it&#39;s in eastern europe and was until 1991 a part of a country called Yugoslavia. Look into Josip Broz Tito (who was our &#39;marchall&#39; and a socialist dictator) and look into the making of Non-Aligned Movement. I&#39;m 43yr white male. When I was born , our country experienced major economic boost , coming from a int.loan , but economy was so blooming it was easily payed off. There are some analysis that citizens of Yugoslavia actually felt and made up to 50% more money / consumer power (?) in the small period of 2 years. At that time 1973 - 75,6 . Now comes 1980 and our beloved dictator dies of old age (had a one of the largest funerals in history - by foreign delegation attendance, look it up, too). It took about 10 years for shit to hits the fan and nationalism to start blooming (YU consisted of 6 republics and about 8 major nations: Slovenians, Croats, Muslims, Serbs, Macedonians, Montenegrians, Kosovo-albanians, and some Hungarians) I&#39;m a minor minority nation, too.</p>

<p>So, with incentives from Western Europe (EU Union in forming) and NATO in forming, Slovenia and Croatia decides to secede. All hell breaks loose, &#39;cause Croatia had about 15% of Serbs living in it, they wanted to keep living in Yugoslavia. Also , they remembered 2nd WW , when Croats had a strong fascist movement of Ustasha. 
Western world allies Croatia to secede , war starts, first Croatia, then Bosnia, then Kosovo. Serbia are bad guys , all the time. 
In retrospective, the reason for this was always the way of independence and non-aligment being rooted very strong in Serbia.</p>

<p>Basically , western europe, USA, and NATO helped very much for a country of 20 million same language speaking , with strong independence movement, strong economy and strong army, to fall apart to 7 small , nationalistic countries.</p>

<p>In comes EU and USA to buy all the good industrial resources, and make us work like slaves for a small vage for them. Divide &amp; rule. 
My country - Serbia was made to look like it&#39;s full of villains (look up some holiwood movies) , savages and nationalistic retards. 
And it was made to look like that - by American Democrats. 
When in fact, the only countries that were accepted into EU were Slovenia and Croatia, countries that are almost purely ethnically clean. (Look up Croatia - operation Storm / Oluja , which made almost all Serbs to flee to Serbia , 10% of Croatia population) Oh, that made with a help of NATO and USA liberals. </p>

<p>Soros all the way involved in &#39;making of these civil societies&#39;. Fact. 
Comes a 1999 and a Kosovo problem , long in waiting, since Serbs and Kosovars had their share of disputes. Again, with the incentives from the West, Kosovo demands indipendence (how lucky for USA that it has some major mining grounds and resources to serve in next 50 years). Liberal politics from USA. </p>

<p>And here comes the first european bombing of independant country since the 2ndWW.  That bombing of Serbia could&#39;ve easily instigated 3rdWW if the Russia was strong as it is now. Luckily for Serbia (which is to &#39;blame&#39; for all wars ever (look up &#39;Gavrilo Princip&#39;)) , it did not grow into major world conflict. 
Kosovo albanians payed of their debt to western world by being a major drug trafficing country, and with an illegal trade of people and organs (look-up &#39;Organ theft in Kosovo , Yellow house&#39;) </p>

<p>Comes 2000, and we were overthrowing our &#39;dictator&#39; Milosevic (who , by the way , wasn&#39;t at all nationalist, but more of a socialist with a strong non-nationalistic view for Serbia) , and happily run into this &#39;Brave new world&#39; of freedom and democracy.</p>

<p>So, 16 years later, we are still waiting to be accepted to European Union, still getting lectured of democracy, still being called savages (by England and USA, most prominently) , and with having now a gullible , easily manipulated (from West) goverment. Still waiting for a better pay , better life, better day. I am a minor minority in Serbia, never had a single nationalistic problem in life, live in a city that has the most variants of religions and churches, probably in the whole eastern europe (see &#39;Novi Sad&#39; it&#39;s a beautiful city - chosen to be Cultural capital of Europe for 2020.) , still waiting to not be called &#39;savage&#39; by the western societies.
Here is an example of a City sign in my neighbour, written in six languages ... it was always like this here where I live. <a href="http://www.alo.rs/resources/images/0000/021/594/zrenjanin_1000x0.jpg">http://www.alo.rs/resources/images/0000/021/594/zrenjanin_1000x0.jpg</a>
Savage , isn&#39;t it ?</p>

<p>I&#39;m seeing a major influx of Syrian , Iraq, Afganistan refugess , passing through my country and city , going to EU to seek a better life. Every day. Croatia and Hungary (both part of EU) had built their walls already, they did not need Trump for that.</p>

<p>So, all I can think when looking at american liberals protest against Trump is this: even though your purpose and goal is credible and worth fighting for, you people live in the bubble and not seeing that Democrats and liberals with a MAJOR HELP of Soros and so called &#39;open societies&#39; are actually blackmailing and destroing countries , inventing wars to sell arms and take resources.
And your protests against Trump are used, organized, or helped by some major villains, as seen throughout the world. Well, if you don&#39;t chill and learn about what&#39;s going on, you will now see the same shit that I in the Serbia, some dude in Iraq, Libya, Sirya , and Ukraine were seeing all these years.  Maybe it&#39;s for the best. Maybe you need a rude awakening. </p>

<p>You guys have really lost your minds at this point.</p>

<p>His refusal to put his business in a <em>real</em> blind trust, his refuse to disclose his tax returns, and his seeking security clearances for his kids are far greater conflicts of interest than anything Clinton has been accused of. He&#39;s surrounding himself with the very people he said he&#39;ll remove from Washington. He&#39;s been going around in interviews walking all of his promises back -- the wall, repealing Obamacare, everything. He&#39;s not going to do a single thing he campaigned on. He&#39;ll spend the next 4 years being an establishment pawn. And you&#39;re still going to be roaming these subs, still finding <em>some</em> new crazy way to defend him.</p>

<p>Because, really, you&#39;ve become what you once criticized -- blind group-thinkers, useful idiots being manipulated by the elite.</p>

It&#39;s hilarious you attack anyone who disagrees with you, even Milo. I guess because he&#39;s not a democrat he&#39;s not gay enough for you? The only intolerant people left in this country are Libs like you :) and just for your information, the prime minister of Israel even commented that he looks forward to working with Bannon. </p>
