        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Have you seen <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wx_iLIlqUVc">The Columbine Cause</a> by Evan Long?</p>

<p>The film presents documentary evidence showing that Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold did not act alone, and that in fact the killings at the school were perpetrated by a satanic cult composed largely of graduates widely referred to as <em>&quot;the Trench Coat Mafia.&quot;</em> Virtually the entire presentation is composed of the tens of thousands of records released by the Jefferson County Sheriff&#39;s Office. </p>

<p>The actual evidence in the police files tells a far different story than every book, news story and documentary about the case - <strong><em>all</em></strong> of which are government disinformation. More than one hundred witnesses saw more than two gunmen or gunmen whose physical description and clothing were different than that of Harris and Klebold. Many of these witnesses corroborated one another on important points. Many other witnesses heard shooting and explosions simultaneously occurring in different parts of the school and no less than 35 placed the blasts and gunfire hours after 12:00, around when Harris and Klebold reportedly committed suicide. A number of others reported that they heard automatic fire.</p>

<p>Dozens were able to positively identify these gunmen by name as members of the Trench Coat Mafia. Other witnesses saw trench-coated suspects with guns and duffel bags in and around the school <em>before</em> the shooting began. One witness saw a group of trench-coated students outside of the school with a similarly-dressed man in his early-to-mid twenties. Witnesses in the science hall said that Dylan Klebold was with an <em>&quot;adult in his thirties&quot;</em> who they believed was a police officer until they saw his sawed-off shotgun. Investigators insisted to these witnesses that they had actually seen Harris. Witness Jennifer Smull, however, said that she knew Harris and had seen him earlier that day at the smoking pit and remained adamant that he was not the man she saw with Klebold. On the evening of the assault, Patrick McDuffee, who belonged to the group, approached investigators and revealed that multiple members of the group had been involved in the planning, the construction and testing of explosives, and the shooting itself. He provided the names of different members, along with descriptions of their homes, vehicles, their roles in the plan and the drugs they used, much of the information - at least where the shooters were concerned - corroborating the stories of eyewitnesses. Very shortly after his initial interview, however, McDuffee recanted everything he said to investigators and has never spoken publicly about the events at Columbine High again.</p>

<p>The official narrative acknowledges that 99 explosive devices were found in and around the school, including two twenty-pound propane tanks that were later found in the cafeteria. The official narrative holds that the tanks were placed there by Harris and Klebold before the attack, and yet not a single witness saw them engaged in suspicious activity in the cafeteria beforehand. The surveillance tapes do not show this either, purportedly because the custodian switched the tape at the very moment Harris and Klebold transported the bombs there. CBS reported the discovery of &quot;more than 120.&quot; Some of these were found in various backpacks and <em>inside cars</em> in the school&#39;s parking lot. The students who owned these backpacks and cars were never identified, nor was it explained how Harris and Klebold were able to access the insides of other students&#39; vehicles. </p>

<p>The Trench Coat Mafia was interested in fascism and spoke German at their meetings, held at different private homes and in the woods. They tested explosives together at a nearby restaurant where many of them worked and were part of a larger satanic subculture in the region involved in cutting, bloodletting, violence and sadistic pedophilia. </p>

<p>The FBI arrived within minutes and all but one of the investigative teams would be headed or co-headed by the FBI agent. The head of the overall investigation was FBI psychologist Dwayne Fuselier, who was a key figure in the negotiations at Waco. </p>

<p>It would later emerge that Fuselier&#39;s sons attended Columbine High at the time of the attack and were close friends with Brooks Brown, who was one of the closest known associates of Harris and Klebold and one of the last people to see them before the assault. </p>

<p>Brown, who was considered an early suspect by police, helped one of Fuselier&#39;s sons produce a film for video class in 1997 depicting four trench-coated gunmen shooting through the halls of the school. The film ends with the gunmen walking away as the school explodes behind them. </p>

<p>The FBI categorically denied that there was any conflict of interest and Fuselier was allowed to stay on as the head of the investigation.</p>

<p>Why? Like 9/11, many people remember precisely where they were and what they were doing when they first heard of the shooting at Columbine High. School shootings weren&#39;t the semi-monthly ritual they would become, and this attack had claimed more lives than the incidents of the previous decades. As such, the attack was seared into the collective psyche and remains the archetypal school shooting despite the more deadly assaults that have occurred since.</p>

<p>This was among the events designed to inflict trauma on the U.S. citizenry, creating emotional support for increased police presence and surveillance in schools, strengthening the state psychiatric system, strengthening gun control laws and creating a general atmosphere of fear in the U.S. President Bill Clinton said in a phone call to a local official shortly afterward that he intended to use the shooting to generate support for gun laws. He also mentioned that he had a very close friend living in the community surrounding the school. By sheer coincidence, President Clinton was reportedly a friend and classmate of Frank DeAngelis, principle at Columbine High. DeAngelis was seen running up and down the stairs very shortly before the shooting began. He had reportedly been warned by a special-ed student that there were <em>&quot;bombs in the trashcan&quot;</em> in the days prior. </p>

<p>The memorial event - lined with military trucks and highlighted by a military flyover - was attended by President Bill Clinton, First Lady Hillary Clinton, and Vice President Al Gore, who appeared, rather conspicuously, in a black trench coat. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thank you. But no one is listening. Our collective critical thinking has been so marred by media blueprinting that we have been socially engineered not to connect the dots, not to see relationships, and not to consider evidence that is outside our normalcy bias, which almost always is because of the alien motives of all such predators </p>

<p>Columbine is something I haven&#39;t done much research into, but this is definitely getting me started on the right foot.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is spot on. We&#39;re slowly putting the pieces together. With the shootings of 2014, 2015, and 2016, we&#39;ve seen federal agents being connected to the communities where the violence was committed with locals talking about their suspicions being scrubbed from the internet.
