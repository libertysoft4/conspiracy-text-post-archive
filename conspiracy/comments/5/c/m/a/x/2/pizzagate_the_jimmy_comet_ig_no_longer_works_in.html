    <div class="md"><p>Yes, this also scares me and wakes me up to just how serious this situation is.</p>

<p>But, I&#39;d like to know that there are no other possibilities. One such being, had there ever been a situation where so many users visited an archived / way back machine version of a website that the act of so many people visiting the page/resource is what caused the page to.be removed?</p>

<p>also, is there any sort of open source initiative that has a communication outlet via normal web, and darknet web protocols (tor, i2p, freenet, retroshare, etc) to prevent such censorship as we continue?</p>

<p>And one last &quot;also&quot;, is there an accepted method of archiving/collecting evidence (digital/electronic) that is accepted as standard practice amongst most law enforcement agencies in the world?  --- if so, could someone share with us that method and it&#39;d be a method which all research participants would adopt, making it easier in the end to have people new to the investigation to accept that &quot; yes in fact this screenshot was once live, but the original page was removed/edited AND the archived version of it had also been tampered/removed&quot;.</p>

<p>Does everything that I am saying above make sense?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>First, no, I don&#39;t ever recall this happening. I thought archive.is&#39;s motto was something like &quot;information should be open for all to know&quot; or something.</p>

<p>To your second question, yeah, actually - <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/getaether/">Aether</a>.</p>

<p>Decentralized, so theoretically no one can delete or edit other people&#39;s posts. Then again, it also means it takes a little setup and a lot of time to sync. It&#39;s not so much for file sharing though. I&#39;m pretty sure it has at least SSL encryption, but it does operate on &quot;clearnet&quot;.</p>

<p>As for &quot;accepted methods&quot; there are a bunch of them. A tool on *nix distros is called wget that can recursively fetch a whole page at a time and convert all the links to local so you can browse it offline. It takes a while though &#39;cause you&#39;re running it on a slower connection and you have to turn the speed down or the site will probably throttle you.</p>

<p>Then for sharing it, creating a torrent with a good few offshore trackers and putting a magnet link to it on Aether might work. A torrent is a good method for ensuring it isn&#39;t shut down, but also exposes the IPs of anyone spreading it to anyone who wants to look.</p>
