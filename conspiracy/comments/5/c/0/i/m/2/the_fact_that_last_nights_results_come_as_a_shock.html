    <div class="md"><p>Oh, Bernie DID win: When you understand how the DNC&#39;s database works, it&#39;s exceptionally easy to flip votes and purge records of those who you know are going to vote Clinton. The Dem&#39;s project with Google was very likely merging our browsing habits (which reveals a ton) with the known census data/govt data, and then using that to purge Sanders supporters. In the database is a prediction percent of how likely you are to vote for a certain candidate. Those were the ones that got erased, switched, or altered. </p>

<p>They used these tricks, and it&#39;s why the statistic that she won fairly was a mere 1:70,000,000,000. </p>

<p>But of course, the database can&#39;t be used like this in the general election because Clinton needed every single voter in there.  </p>

<p>We see in the emails--especially the outline discussed between Soros and Podesta--that this is a long-term, concerted effort to endorse a &quot;populist movement&quot; (and I put that in quotes because it&#39;s really to foment local instability to capitalize from it, rather than a genuine one like that of Sanders).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This speaks more to effective compartmentalization. Of course there are observable instances of ... I don&#39;t even know what to call them at this point. Anchors?</p>

<p>There are observable instances of anchors pushing propaganda. But overall, they may have been as blinded by the filters of censorship they purveyed.</p>

<p>As misanthropic as I am as a person, and all the mistrust I have of media and government, something inside my mind cannot reconcile the possibility that they were all such simple agents of misinformation.</p>

<p>They had incentive to toe the line in interest of a paycheck. I think many of them actually believed the shit they were peddling.</p>

<p>Not that that really changes anything for me today. I have no sympathy, and neither do I think that anyone should let them restructure themselves.</p>

<p>Many of the real journalists this election season were condemned or even killed in the attempt to bring us the real information. And for each and every one of those journalists, who had to scuttle about in the dark behind the scenes, the MSM are to blame for this atrocity of the 1st amendment.</p>

<ul>
<li>PA was TRUMP&#39;s 1-2 hours before they called it. You had commentators saying things like, PA is going to go TRUMP&#39;s way, but we&#39;re not calling it yet.</li>
<li>The NYT suddenly changed their percent of vote counted in PA from 98% to 89% about 1/2 hr before they called it</li>
<li>hillary did not concede.</li>
<li>The Dow Jones was down 800 pts. then suddenly it was only down 300 pts.</li>
