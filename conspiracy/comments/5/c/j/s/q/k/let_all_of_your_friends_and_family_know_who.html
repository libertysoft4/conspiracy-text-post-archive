    <div class="md"><p>Yep, even tho Russia and China wants a stable relationship with the US i dont think they are happy with the propaganda against them. I think they wish US would burn and could potentially attack US if they see its people and government as weak and in poor shape.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Realistically, we have to come to grips that there is propaganda flowing both directions. At least in their case they have a tighter grip of control over the flow of information. The USA can track it, but there is a lot of red tape in the way of taking action to keep propaganda out of the country. </p>

<p>I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if Russia is fueling a lot of the &quot;GET OUT INTO THE STREETS!&quot; type of propaganda. A US revolution is exactly what our enemies want. The US and other countries have deployed the tactic in other countries. And now the barrel of the gun is aimed at us.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Very true, but looking and reading alot of Putin statements is that hes very very tired of how Nato/US are putting up their anti-missiles in europe pointed towards them.</p>

<p>A bbc journalist asked him why he was so aggressive in the air-space towards other nations like Sweden and Norway and he was laughing his balls off and replied &quot;How would the US feel if i made a deal with Mexico, Cuba, Canada to put anti missiles towards the US ? How can you say we are the aggressors because we train our pilots ? Russia just want a stable relationship because it will benefit both countries but we want to have our national interests included too.&quot; 
I doesnt feel he want to be unfriendly with you. If i were him i would be really pissed how you (US/Nato) treat Russia and i would definetly exploit the US if you get chaos in the country.</p>

<p>But ofc thats just how i see it. And the more China-Russia-India&#39;s relationship gets stronger i would say Americans really need to worry about the fact you are in decline as world power.</p>
