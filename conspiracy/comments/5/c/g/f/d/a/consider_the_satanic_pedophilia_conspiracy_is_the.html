<p>To be honest, I&#39;m starting to worry it&#39;s a CTR-like effort to discredit the people going after this, who think it&#39;ll be a cause for taking down Clinton.  I&#39;ve been seeing a lot of vote inflation on posts and comments that hardly even make sense.</p>

<p>The parent comment says this has happened before, which makes me even more nervous.  I don&#39;t want an excuse to appear for Trump to not be held to the Clinton investigation.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Part of the reason it was pushed is because a lot of low info folks can&#39;t wrap their head around the enormity of the issues from the emails (foreign donations, foia issues, media collusion, etc) but they freak out over &#39;black magic&#39; and &#39;devil worship&#39;.

<p>Well, I guess if you&#39;re going to swap in the charges against Clinton that we have actual facts to back up, blast this stuff out all over the internet.  Maybe enough people pushing for an investigation really is all it&#39;ll take.</p>

<p>For me, the web of people &quot;implicated&quot; was the saddest.  It looked like something out of A Beautiful Mind.  The pictures of kids grossed me out too, I immediately started wondering if they had put actual child porn pictures in it to make anyone who saves it a criminal</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It started over there as a quick means to red pill the masses on what was in the leaked emails. The reasoning being that minority groups targeted by Clinton also happened to be religious, and no one was really getting through the media block with anything else. Sensationalizing the spirit cooking thing worked, got people asking questions, even when that sub was questioning the tactic amongst themselves. I think they&#39;re still running with it because of how well it took off.</p>

<p>And I believe the OP is referencing the 80s Satanic Panic in the US, something worth looking into if you have the time.</p>

<p>Do they think that these strategies will actually pay off?  </p>

<p>Just talked about the Satanic Panic in a separate thread, worried that this will follow the same course.  If you&#39;re on the inside, any chance you could try to get them to dial it back to a point where it doesn&#39;t seem so desperate?  </p>

<p>I&#39;d like to see the Clintons actually get investigated, and the hysteria over a still very weak case is making me start to worry.  It might be long enough after the election to start putting very preliminary outlines of people&#39;s suspicions up on <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a> (omitting the satanism stuff, hopefully).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not active on that sub, mainly just a lurker, so regrettably I can&#39;t influence much over there. The politics sub, though, that is a great idea, now that it seems to be returning to a unbiased state. I also agree with you about the damaging effects. In the long run, based on history, this probably won&#39;t pay off. TPTB are notorious for deflecting and refocusing just enough that anyone who asks question feels like an idiot afterward, or is made to feel like an idiot by their peers. The best method in my opinion, is slowly bringing others in with the hard facts, those who aren&#39;t aware of the corruption and pay to play beforehand because of media interference. Child sex rings and trafficking should come after, and without the satanic context, mainly because it&#39;s a sick subject that makes people uncomfortable, and it&#39;s easier to write stuff like that off so they need to be eased into the information.</p>

<p>You probably feel the same way, I&#39;m assuming, I was just kind of rambling here.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah I agree, there&#39;s a lot of gloating, I&#39;m not one of those that advocates for that however. I prefer taking the high road and trying to preserve relationship rather than destroy them, however nevertrumpers didn&#39;t exactly make it easy to take the high road so some people are lashing out after all the insanity. There are still plenty of people dedicated to exposing the inner circle of corrupt politicians via wikileaks and beyond, I have to be honest though, I&#39;m of the opinion that there&#39;s a possibility that wikileaks has been compromised and the leaks we&#39;ve been fed are filtered thus limiting our ability to expose the truth.

<p>If humans weren&#39;t created with free will, then Eve wouldn&#39;t have even been able to eat the apple in the first place. Satan isn&#39;t an all powerful antithesis to God in that book, so he can&#39;t &quot;give&quot; things to humans of his own accord.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p><strong>Wall of text inbound</strong></p>

<p>I would like to preface this with a disclaimer that I am in no way an expert but the occult and its teachings are something that I truly enjoy and I have dedicated my life to the study of it. With that being said I try to show people what I have learned because there seems to be an overwhelming stigma and fear attached to occult teachings casting them off as &quot;satantic&quot; and &quot;evil&quot; which is simply not the case. Like any great knowledge it can be wielded to enslave you or used as a great gift to set you free. The more you know about these teachings the more you can stand in confidence when those who wish to keep you enslaved in fear try to use them to your detriment. Unveil these hidden truths and inspire an apocalypse of the soul and you too can awaken the Christ within. After all occult simply means hidden.  </p>

<p>Essentially both these symbols are used in whats called &quot;ceremonial magic/magick&quot; and Alchemy. Many, if not all, occult teachings contain the study of ceremonial magick and Alchemy. Whether it be Thelema, Wicca, The Qabbalah, Free Masonry, Rosicrucianism, Hindu mysticism or The Templars. I won&#39;t go into the process and practice of ceremonial magic here unless someone is interested.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://imgur.com/a/KgnG7">pentagram</a> is an ancient symbol used in the magical arts by alchemists, magicians and sorcerers and signifies the five properties of the Great Magical Agent, The Great Astral Light, the five elements of nature, the five senses of man, and the five extremities of the human body. What we must keep in mind is that while this symbol itself is not evil it is the <a href="http://imgur.com/a/uIHJs">perversion</a> of it that makes it left handed. When it is flipped on its head this symbol becomes to the magician or sorcerer a form of &quot;black magic&quot; and therefore a means of evil. In symbolism an inverted or distorted figure always means that it is being misused. To the adept of the dark arts an inverted pentagram is called the &quot;sign of the cloven hoof&quot;. The upright star with its point turned down signifies the fall of the morning star. So be wary of anyone rocking this image. I can recall a time when I met someone with an inverted pentagram tattooed on his shoulder. I approached him and asked if he practiced magic. He had no idea what I was talking about. I pointed out the perverted symbol that donned his arm and he laughed casting it off as something he got on a whim to scare to people. Little did he know what dark spirits he was invoking by using this distorted image. I simply smiled, nodded and exclaimed he should look into it further. </p>

<p><a href="http://imgur.com/a/az6ZD">Baphomet</a> has an interesting history which can be dated back to the Templars. Many believed they worshiped this image as an idol but that is up for debate. Today we see <a href="http://imgur.com/a/bxgJc">it</a> used by the self proclaimed &quot;Satanic Temple&quot; Take note of the pentagram in both representations. The latter is inverted.  Again it is a symbol used to communicate certain truths about the visible and invisible universe which when understood can again be used for great evil or great good. We see in Baphomet a hermaphorditic humanoid with a goats head, wings and cloven feet. This type of hybrid imagery has been used by all ancient clutures and priest crafts whether it be the sphinx in the priestcraft of the Egyptians or the winged cherubs of Judeo Christianity. In the work titled &quot;The Book Of Splendours&quot; Elphas Levi explains Baphomets rather odd and bizarre appearance succinctly with this passage.</p>

<p>“[Baphomet] is a knowledge rising in opposition to idolatry, protesting though the very monstrosity of the idol. The Israelites were forbidden to give divine concepts the figure of a man or of any animal; thus, on the ark of the covenant and in the sanctuary, they dared sculpt only cherubs, that is, sphinxes with the bodies of bulls and the heads of men, eagles or lions. These mixed figures reproduced neither the complete form of any man, nor that of any animal. These hybrid creations of impossible animals gave to understand that the image was not an idol or reproduction of a living thing, but rather a character or representation of something having its existence in thought. Baphomet is not worshipped; it is God who is worshipped, this faceless God behind this formless form, this image which resembles no created being. Baphomet is not a God; He is the sign of initiation.” [5]</p>

<p>His right hand points to the white moon his left to the black. The dual nature of the astral light is also reflected in the alchemical formula “Solve et Coagula:” These two operations are represented by the words written on the arms of Baphomet: SOLVE, to dissolve, to project, to move; and COAGULA, to coagulate, to concentrate, to fix. The image has breasts and the caduceus rising from the groin which represents the union of opposites. The masculine and the feminine united in equilibrium. The progenitive caduceus being the ancient sign of genesis rising betwixt the life giving breasts where all who are born unto this human form succor for nourishment. The torch rising from the top of his head is the illuminated mind. The pineal gland fully awakened. The third eye opened and aware of the self peering deeply into the mystery of mysteries.</p>

<p>Do not fear these images and symbols my friends. Rather take and eat of the fruits of knowledge that the great serpent guards. It is your duty to rise from darks depths of ignorance and storm the gates of illumination saying &quot;I&#39;ve come home now!&quot; Break the shackles that have enslaved you and you too can, as Morpheus said to Neo, &quot;free your mind.&quot; The world is ruled by symbols. Understand them and you can rule your world.    </p>

    <div class="md"><p>you replied to me in another comment thread mentioning you were going to post this. so i followed you here.</p>

<p>that said....i agree completely and perhaps we got off on the wrong foot here. i agree that the occult in and of itself isnt bad. as occult is simply hidden mysteries or the study of them or something like that so the occult itself isnt a bad thing.</p>

<p>the problem though becomes as you rightly point out:</p>

<p>&quot;What we must keep in mind is that while this symbol itself is not evil it is the perversion of it that makes it left handed. When it is flipped on its head this symbol becomes to the magician or sorcerer a form of &quot;black magic&quot; and therefore a means of evil.&quot;</p>

<p>this then becomes the chief problem....generally speaking people arent studying or reading about the christian occult and how it relates to blood human sacrifices....it is always some version of satanism. christianity certainly has symbols all throughout and perhaps there should be a christian occult or group that studies the deep mysteries of Christ. but this is rarely the case, it is usually the satanist that here doing that.</p>

<p>as such the symbols very often take on an evil connotation. </p>

<p>even knowing this....a life time of programming is hard to always react against. and having read many of these pizzagate threads, a lot of people seem to be defending some of this stuff. so i suspect there is a larger problem at work beyond just not getting the definition of occult correct.</p>

<p>that said i appreciate the reply and you clearly know quite a bit about it.</p>

<p>if you don&#39;t mind i would love to hear what you have to say on:</p>

<p>&quot;Essentially both these symbols are used in whats called &quot;ceremonial magic/magick&quot; and Alchemy. Many, if not all, occult teachings contain the study of ceremonial magick and Alchemy. Whether it be Thelema, Wicca, The Qabbalah, Free Masonry, Rosicrucianism, Hindu mysticism or The Templars.

    <div class="md"><p>Sure I would be happy to talk about the process of ceremonial magic. First addressing your thoughts on what seems to be the absence of Christian occultism. If you would like to know more about that you will find that the mysticism of Christ and those who study it are quite extensive. Rosicrucians and The Templars are the gold standard for Christian mysticism and I personally love studying that sect of the occult because I used to be a Roman Catholic.</p>

<p>I would like to start out with a quote from the great occultist Manly P. Hall on the practice of virtue trumping magic always. </p>

<p>&quot;Among the Qabbalists of the Middle Ages were a great number of black magicians who strayed from the noble concepts of the Sepher Yetzirah and became enmeshed in demonism and witchcraft. They sought to substitute magic mirrors, consecrated daggers, and circles spread around posts of coffin nails, for the living of that virtuous life which, without the assistance of complicated rituals or submundane creatures, unfailingly brings man to the state of true individual completion.&quot;</p>

<p>I find this to be very important. I myself do not practice ceremonial magic. To master these practices even if one plans to use them for good is quite difficult to say the least and has really been lost on our modern secular culture. Unless you manage to find a true sorcerer who can teach you the ways of the astral plains I would recommend staying away from most ceremonial magic. In &quot;The Occult Sciences&quot; Arthur Edward Waites explains that to invoke the elementals of the astral plain one must be void of any vices or passions lest you become a plaything for the spirits. If you could not curb your fears of certain aspects of Earth, water, air, and fire your gonna have a bad time. This however does not stop us from studying it and understanding its purpose. </p>

<p>Ultimately the practice of ceremonial magic is to gain fruits of transcendental  knowledge and supernatural power through modes of calling the spirits of the astral plain down to the physical world. A magician who has summoned one of these spirits may also make a contract with a spirit which would facilitate an exchange of some service between the two. Classic example is promising your service in the after life to this spirit in exchange for some temporal talent or wealth. The &quot;I made a deal with a the devil at the crossroads&quot; story is probably the most well known. Now you may be saying to yourself that that&#39;s a bunch nonsense and there is no such thing as these &quot;spirits&quot; who can give you super powers. My response to people on this is to ask them if they have ever heard of astral projection. Most people have at least heard of this in passing and if you listen to anyone who has practiced it and managed to play in the astral realm they all have similar stories of seeing strange alien creatures. These are the spirits of the astral realm and they are what the magician is trying to contact. </p>

<p>Most ceremonial magic is performed with the use of a <a href="http://imgur.com/a/8BiqM">wand/sword</a> which is consecrated, <a href="http://imgur.com/a/qxS07">a magic circle</a> which protects the sorcerer and <a href="http://imgur.com/a/upYZS">another circle</a> for the spirit to be summoned in. Depending on what <a href="http://imgur.com/a/cMv4a">kind of circle</a> is drawn dictates the type of spirit to be summoned. Then a series of prayers is said while moving about the circle. If all is done correctly and the magician deemed worthy an astral spirit will apparite. It is at this point you can communicate with it. Ask what kind of spirit it is. Dismiss it. Ask it for a favor or some knowledge etc.    </p>

    <div class="md"><p>might i ask why you left the roman catholics? and are you religious at all now? especially curious given your knowledge on the subject.</p>

<p>i want to ask you....i am approaching this first and foremost from a christian perspective....specitically a mormon christian perspective.</p>

<p>so terms like magician are at best taboo. to that end....are the knights templars the only known holy occult group? this almost feels like it dives down an endless rabbit hole.</p>

<p>in the story of moses in the old testament for example....the pharoah uses magicians to try and copy moses and they are of course the bad guys.</p>

<p>the only scriptural story of a guy that invokes spirits seems to be stories about Solomon though none made it into the bible if I recall correctly. the founder of the mormons Joseph Smith never mentions anything either, though he is said to have used a few odd things(hats and stones) and Paul i think heals a guy with a shadow(one of the apostles does). the book of mormon folks use a urim and thunimum(spelling)</p>

<p>so the stuff is out there and the scriptures do speak of it....but i guess as far as invoking spirits for help? that part I havent noticed in any christian lore anywhere. the bible for example warns against familar spirits.</p>

<p>I guess i am both curious and cautious to learn more....i have interacted with the spirit world enough to know it is there and it is very real....but i also know to treat cautiously in certain respects. my caution is then not to inadvertedly invoke the black arts because of course it isnt talked about. it is rarely mentioned and it is almost always seen as evil. if the apostle that healed a guy with his shadow was alive today, no doubt he&#39;d be called a satanist.</p>

<p>I do agree with this:</p>

<p>&quot;If you could not curb your fears of certain aspects of Earth, water, air, and fire your gonna have a bad time.&quot;</p>

<p>you cannot go in half hearted and fearful. do not interact with spirits if you are unaware of what you are dealing with. in this i do believe christians are sorely overpowered these days. with no knowledge on this subject.</p>

<p>i guess what started this for me was....learning how to cast out satan thoroughly and completely and those old stories of healing the sick and the lame and so on....attempting to tap into that faith and power which seems to ellude me. </p>

<p>&quot;Unless you manage to find a true sorcerer who can teach you the ways of the astral plains I would recommend staying away from most ceremonial magic.&quot;</p>

<p>I believe i have met and know one such fellow. due to conflicting things that occurred....this brings me to a spiritual crisis where i cannot tell who is right and who is wrong.</p>

<p>&quot;Arthur Edward Waites explains that to invoke the elementals of the astral plain one must be void of any vices or passions lest you become a plaything for the spirits.&quot;</p>

<p>sadly the aforementioned healing that i seek, makes me bound to certain vices. i simply cannot seem to shake them....this is why i think i remain confused. </p>

<p>i do actually know a bit about the holy occult as a thing....but i wanted to see what you knew as its clear you know stuff i do not know. and i havent studied it extensively or anything. but i do know some stuff.</p>

<p>in any event....good conversation so far. much appreciated. </p>

<p>if you want we can continue chatting in PMs or here. not sure how you feel about some of this stuff.</p>

I&#39;ll send you a PM addressing the rest of your comment as well. What I can say now though is to not fear the knowledge that occult teachings contain. Just start researching. Egyptian mythology is a great place to start.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>no worries about the late reply...its all good.....i even hear rumors that there is life beyond reddit? tell me....what is outside like? lol</p>

<p>yes we all have our vices....if only it was so easy to get rid of them</p>

<p>so how are you defining ceremonial magic....i feel like that could mean 10000 different things depending on the person.</p>

<p>my stance on the mormons is....joseph smith was a prophet who restored much of the true gospel of Christ that had been lost thanks to nearly 2000 years of the catholics going off course....and since the time of joseph smith the mormon church has gone off course too. so you could say i am mormon, but not really a fan of the current church.</p>

<p>yes i am aware smith depending on who you ask was the greatest con man in history of the biggest saint since Jesus.</p>

<p>Rosicrucians? nope....unfamilar.</p>

<p>i&#39;ll check out those videos....they are quite long so i&#39;ll have to make specific time for that.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sorry for not getting back to you sooner. Been a little busy. I am also bound to certain vices but that shouldn&#39;t stop you form seeking the knowledge that is out there. I would just recommend staying away from CEREMONIAL magic. There are all kinds of magic which to occultists simply means exercising your will. </p>

<p>Are you still involved with the Mormons? Do you know much about Rosicrucians? Like I said I would maybe start there. Depending on where you live there might be a local sect you can reach out to. </p>

<p>This guy is great. He has some great talks that may interest you. </p>

<p>Pentagram is nothing other than satanic. So is baal, baphomet, molech and Ishtar. They co-opted Christianity to create a satanic Catholicism which then destroyed European &quot;paganism&quot; which wasn&#39;t satanic (didn&#39;t sacrifice children, didn&#39;t hate the beauty of the image of God in people) </p>

I just don&#39;t get why people say Christians are crazy,  I mean look. We have been saying for thousands of years that people are evil and there are spiritual powers behind it. The Bible isnt just some book that talks about how to be a good person. It talks about very very advanced subjects beyond our realm. And since it&#39;s all real,  God even makes promises to you through it that you will see come true by prayers and experiences. God is real people,  these days are very close to what the Bible talks about being the end of days. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is a huge topic and it feels like we&#39;re accelerating towards a greater understanding every day on a mass level. The evolution of consciousness is happening now.</p>

<p>This is likely to get down-voted by those who are easily shaken from their current beliefs, but it&#39;s worth it if a few people decided to dig further.</p>

<p>The Khazarians are one group worth looking into regarding the &#39;fall&#39; of the angels, which is actually a story about the descent of 5th density ETs onto earth. Certain ET groups accelerated neanderthal evolution into modern human form by altering the DNA. Spirituality is a true way to connect to GOD (which is the SOURCE of all) but religion is the control system that these negative ET groups set up to control humanity. Many of the &#39;gods&#39; from myth are only ET visitors from different races who&#39;ve visited in ancient times.</p>

<p>These rituals based in fear or trauma (murder, war, pedophilia) are a source of energy and many of these negative groups feed off of us like parasites. Every major war is a false flag war. One hand creates the problem, the other hand provides the solution.</p>

<p>Reincarnation is real... and everyone has lived many lives, some only here on this planet and others elsewhere in the universe. There are both positive and negative ET groups incarnated in human form now, and these &#39;satanic&#39; type people, who are the same as the Illuminati, practice energy-based blood ritual (magic) on large and small scales to manifest their preferred reality over the masses. The Khazarians are one such group, and relates to many of the current world leaders involved in globalism.</p>

<p>David Icke speaks the truth. We are dealing with a multi-dimensional reality and centuries of misunderstood history. These things are scary to some but we are inching our way to disclosure on many subjects every day.</p>

<p>I know a lot of it might sound crazy to some, which is why the truth can&#39;t fully be told to everyone all at once. There is too much brainwashing and mind control. And this is also why the positive ET groups don&#39;t just land in a public place today... They are contacting people on an individual basis and making themselves seen here and there. Peace.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I grew up atheist, or actually agnostic, but someone very close to me had a huge spiritual awakening a few years ago and began to manifest clairvoyant abilities, seeing multidimensionally, out of body experiences, astral projection, telepathy with ET Spirit Guides. This isn&#39;t exactly very common, but there are many others who have experienced this as well. </p>

<p>I&#39;ve since been studying many related fields for the past several years and have worked hard to cross-verify and discern certain teachers who understand these things and teach truth. For anyone interested in these things, check out recent stuff by David Wilcock. He goes in depth on many of these subjects, but foremost is involved with the areas of consciousness evolution (ascension) and the forthcoming ET disclosures.</p>

People can&#39;t discern for themselves what they should take seriously and what to leave alone?

Are people not allowed to use their imaginations anymore and discuss things without constantly trying to please the rigidly skeptical who can only think in the left side of their brains without having a concern trolling, insult spewing meltdown like you?  If there&#39;s people that judge the entire sub because there is something here that they don&#39;t like or agree with I say good riddance to that close minded ignorance.</p>

<p>You are designed to live your life with freewill in this dimension. Denying that and viewing it as a realm of enslavement is the number one tenant in Luciferean ideology. You have been tricked, I don&#39;t say this out of condescension or hate I say it truthfully. You have been lied to and tricked, it&#39;s not too late to save yourself. </p>

<p>You do not write the truths of this reality and thusly these are not my truths or my ideas. They are the immutable components of natural law. You are on the wrong path and you&#39;ve been offered an olive branch, I suggest you take it. Your truths are lies to manipulate you into falling into Lucifereanism.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>im not discouraging anyone or anything, so far all I have said is show the evidence.  Your evidence doesent go above some vague emails and a pizza shop.  I mean we already know that the FBI so far has been the largest disseminator of child porn in history. There are so many cases of child rings caught within the government and not prosecuted with evidence.  I believe there are high level things going on.  Penn state is a prime example, I refuse to believe that the Sandusky charity does not have more victims.  Also the Vatican is a prime example of international situations and I believe that was why the nazi pope stepped down. But this is wild speculation mixed with political rhetoric and flimsy stuff.  Saville is another prime example.  I mean the subway guy even should of been caught a long time ago.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>No one has to do shit for you.  There&#39;s plenty of evidence about pedophile rings already which is why people are investigating in the first place, which you wouldn&#39;t know of course, because your expect it to be handed to you instead of doing a little work to educate your lazy ass like now.   If you can&#39;t wrap your head around it go stick it in the sand somewhere.

    <div class="md"><p>Yep. The Matrix is a great analogy to what our current situation is... Also, the Wachowski&#39;s have gotten eerily close to great truths in several of their films. Cloud Atlas is a fairly accurate depiction of reincarnation, even Jupiter Ascending has &#39;some&#39; accuracy, but it&#39;s all thrown in a blender and obviously doesn&#39;t work that well as a film.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Moloch is just another figure in the satanic magical system. I don&#39;t know if he/it was an actual physical being or only representative of an energetic archetype, but the idea of worshipping these deities is about opposing God-Source through &#39;free will&#39; in 3rdDimension. It&#39;s all energy-work on some level, and blood sacrifice, and other trauma, is a way of channeling energy to these &#39;deities&#39;. Anu, Enki, Enlil, Baal, and many more were all ET instigators in our history, in these cases from the Orion or Sirius constellations. </p>

<p>Much of what is going on relates to &#39;inter-dimensional&#39; beings as opposed to &#39;extra-terrestrial&#39;... they are specifically called Archons, and David Icke has gone into this subject extensively. The reptilians and Archons (Andromedans) work hand-in-hand in controlling many governments (Illuminati), banking and religious systems. These are all systems meant to enslave us.</p>

<p>There is only one true God (Source), which is where all things in the Universe come from, and all things are made of, including us. We are all extensions of God-Source... any being that has claimed to be a &#39;god&#39; is not, although sometimes in the past, such as Ancient Egypt, some well-meaning ET visitors were mistaken as &#39;gods&#39; and worshipped. </p>

<p>There have been many, such as Jesus (Yeshua) or Buddha, who have come to teach us greater truths. These are what we&#39;d call &#39;ascended masters&#39;. The true God-Source does not need worship, and is not vengeful, only false &#39;gods&#39; do and are.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I hear ya. But those labels are thrown around too frequently to disparage things not well understood...  The &#39;New Age&#39; movement from decades ago was actually a Psi-op invented by the Tavistock Institute to discredit legit information. There are far less opportunists than there were in years past, mostly because it&#39;s gets harder to fake the real thing these days. We have a mass awakening happening, and we have the internet. It&#39;s good to keep and open mind and stay discerning... blind skepticism can often be the enemy of truth.</p>

<p>Schizophrenia is not likely to be mistaken as a legit source channeled information, the symptoms are too chaotic. I personally feel that many mental illnesses are a result of parasitic/dimensional interference...somewhat related to the idea of &#39;possession&#39;.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh bullshit. Yes, we all love the phrase &quot;muddy the waters&quot; now, and we all know why. You don&#39;t get to just throw that at anyone you disagree with and expect us to blindly accept that you are on the side of truth.  </p>

<p>There is no reason to believe that the name Jesus refers to a real person, much less that he was somehow resurrected. Come on people, we can do better than this. This is not an all or nothing game. Many of us here are scientists, engineers, mathematicians, or academics. You make blanket statements like &quot;they were behind evolution&quot; or &quot;they built the Tower of Babel&quot; and talk about fallen angels and the Garden of Eden and expect us not to laugh?  </p>

<p>Look, there is something new that the world is coming to understand, for sure. There is more to the nature of the Universe than many people would imagine. But it is real and physical just like everything else. No magic, no gods, but a dramatically revised perspective on the true nature of reality is rapidly emerging. </p>

<p>I mean no offense, but you need to take a long, hard look at yourself and think about whether you are offering real, meaningful insights or merely chasing that &quot;eureka!&quot; sensation. We all do it, there is no shame in it.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Just a thought: In regards to scientists, engineers, mathematicians, and academics, if we step into a hypothetical reality where God, Satan, angels, and demons all exist (presumably in a realm/dimension/capacity beyond our comprehension) and we know that to 100% fact (again, hypothetical), then what gives science–the irrefutable cornerstone of modern societies–the power to overrule and invalidate the heavenly realm? After all, science is an ever-evolving process that continues to accumulate knowledge as time goes on (i.e. by nature it is incomplete), slowly learning by trial and error, rinse and repeat etc. </p>

<p>So if in this hypothetical world we admit that there are entities and beings beyond our realm, how can one say anything along the lines of &quot;With science I&#39;ve disproved God!&quot; (not your words, just an example to illustrate my point) with any more relief and comfort than those who adamantly believe in said realm? After all, I highly doubt that every scientist, engineer, mathematician, and academic has poured through every record of scientific data and therefore must be operating on some notion of faith/presumption that the words written in well-revered articles are in fact true and conclusive. When you start to analyze this stance from a philosophy standpoint, it really starts to unravel and place huge cracks in the concrete-ness of the Unquestionable Scientific Authority (for lack of a better term).</p>

<p>I&#39;m not trying to convince you one way or the other, I&#39;m just floating out the thought of &quot;Why are you so confident that things unexplained <em>and unexplainable</em> by science simply cannot exist?&quot; Perhaps it provides one holding that viewpoint some sort of comfort and assurance that the reality you&#39;ve been pitched your whole entire life <em>indeed is</em> the way the world/universe works, which draws loose parallels to the way America thought the election would work out prior to their rude awakening. Perhaps you don&#39;t <em>actually</em> deny this theory entirely but rather accept that based on what seems to have worked for you up til now, the <em>likelihood</em> of it being real is low enough to where you can safely assume it is not. But again, if we&#39;re in this hypothetical reality, isn&#39;t that exactly what a Lucifer-figure would want of you?</p>

<p>Sorry to ramble, these kinds of thoughts bounce around in my head on a daily basis. All I&#39;m really trying to say is, while you can be sure of the <em>chances</em> of one thing, you really can never be too sure of any one thing entirely. And in light of all the crazy events that have happened in the past decade and beyond, I&#39;m very hesitant to ever call anything farfetched. After all, didn&#39;t we all used to regard people claiming the government was tapping their phones as tin-foil hat wearing crazies? Low and behold, the NSA has been active and not without work for quite a while up until Snowden blew his whistle. Just another example to show no matter how ridiculous something sounds (often times by design to muddy up the waters), the status quo with which we draw comparison to (eventually concluding that it&#39;s farfetched etc.) is not as infallible as our comfort-seeking-brains believe it to be.</p>

<p>If any of that was unclear I&#39;d be happy to further expand/ramble. I&#39;d love to hear your thoughts!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, there are great truths in the bible, and other religious texts... In the case of the bible, Roman Emperor Constantine tampered with much of it. Jesus did not preach of Hell or Satan. These thing were added later.</p>

<p>I absolutely believe in Jesus and his teachings, but he taught that we all have Divinity within us, not that he was literally the ONLY son of God... and lizard people, they are reptilians from the Orion constellation. And I KNOW that&#39;s hard to believe.</p>

<p>There are no shape-shifters as Icke as been misinterpreted as saying, but these groups are incarnated in human form in some instances. This where the archetypal form of Satan comes from. The Catholics needed this fear inducing image to incorporate into their magical system. Not all people who are religious are serving dark beings, but overall it&#39;s been a system of control to keep society from advancing.</p>

<p>Well I&#39;m not &quot;religious&quot; so what you&#39;re saying doesn&#39;t apply to me. In addition, I don&#39;t see how what you&#39;re saying is controversial. If anything it&#39;s rooted in a fallacy and a lack of knowledge when it comes to Abrahamic religions, Yeshua/Jesus, syncretism and early versions of the NT. None of which I am holding against you, just sayin&#39;.</p>

<p>Anyway, I gave you &quot;Jewish&quot; things that you can look into, things that have nothing to do with Catholicism and what you&#39;re attempting to pass off as fact.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Nobody is a chosen one. Everyone has access to truth, which comes from the Higher Self, which is connected to Source. There are truthful messengers out there, and through meditation a person can feel what resonates with them. This is one way of finding the right direction... </p>

<p>In my case, and increasingly for many others, there is direct communication with beings who are here to assist in this awakening that is happening now. This source of information, and through my own personal research into other sources, sometimes even ancient knowledge, has lead me to specific answers. There are many ancient cultures who had the answers all along.</p>

<p>There are groups from MANY different star systems who have come and gone, some good and some bad, but the reptilians specifically come from Alpha Draconis in the Orion system. </p>

<p>Daryl Anka has been channeling Bashar for over 30 years and has never given any false information. If you&#39;re only response is &#39;lol&#39;, then you haven&#39;t given that source of information a chance. The reason why some people never learn anything is because they need things to look and feel a certain way. This is conditioning. </p>

<p>Noah&#39;s flood: There are so may things wrong with this story, it&#39;s gonna take me a while to list them simply because I&#39;ll be laughing about it the whole time.</p>

<p>1) The story itself was plagiarized from earlier myths.  Gilgamesh, anyone?</p>

<p>2) There is not enough water ON OR IN this planet in ANY form for it to have happened.  The only way for God to flood the entire planet such that it covered the highest mountain- which, by the way, is Mount friggin&#39; Everest at approx. 8,850 meters (29,035 feet) above sea level- is if he magicked it into existence, and then magicked it out of existence when he was done.</p>

<p>3) Speaking of Everest, the tip of that thing is so high up, that if God really did flood the planet about twenty feet above that, Almost everything on the ark would freeze to death.  Anything that didn&#39;t freeze would die of exhaustion and/or suffocation because of reduced air pressure lowering the amount of available oxygen by about 33%.</p>

<p>4) Let&#39;s talk about that water now.  That much water will cause massive changes to water pressure, light filtration, the temperature of the water, and don&#39;t even get me started on salt and fresh water inevitably mixing.  Nearly everything UNDER the water would die.</p>

<p>5) There&#39;s simply not enough space on the ark.  Even if Noah only took two of every unclean animal, seven of the clean, and cut out all the variation and stuck to the bare minimum so that &quot;micro evolution&quot; could do its thing, guess what?  There&#39;s still not enough room in the big wooden box for all of them.</p>

<p>6) Speaking of tight squeezes, let&#39;s talk about food and water.  The largest animals ALONE eat several hundred tons of food in a year per individual.  If there&#39;s not enough room on the ark for the animals, there&#39;s DEFINITELY no room for the food.  And what about the water?  Sure it&#39;s only gonna rain for forty days, but the flood itself is gonna last a whole year, so what the hell is Noah gonna do about water for the next 325 days?</p>

<p>7) Let&#39;s assume everything on the boat survives, though.  What then?  There&#39;s no plant life left for the herbivores to eat- guess what?  Land-based plants don&#39;t do so well under thirty thousand feet of water- and the carnivores will inevitably eat them into oblivion, thereby killing their own species&#39; as well.</p>

<p>8) Now let&#39;s talk about genetic variation.  Two individuals- hell, SEVEN individuals- isn&#39;t nearly enough to propagate an entire species.  Bare minimum for proper genetic diversity in a species is 50 individuals.  With only two or seven, you&#39;re gonna get a LOT of inbreeding.  And with that much inbreeding going on, there&#39;s going to be a LOT of genetic defects going on, which will eventually kill the species anyway.</p>

<p>9) And finally, the pièce de résistance, the biggest quesiton: How the fake hell did the animals get TO the ark AND back to where they lived without drowning in the oceans, dying of exhaustion (or becoming so exhausted that they drowned), or just straight up getting killed by something, all without leaving any evidence that they went anywhere?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>1)  The story itself was plagiarized from earlier myths. Gilgamesh, anyone?
The following 2 paragraphs are straight from that article
<a href="http://www.apologeticspress.org/APContent.aspx?article=5194">http://www.apologeticspress.org/APContent.aspx?article=5194</a>
While the similarities between Gilgamesh and the account of the Flood in Genesis are striking, there are vast differences that the Genesis-copied-Gilgamesh theory does not adequately explain. Why are the number of decks and the dimensions of the Ark different? How does Utnapishtim finish such a massive boat in so brief a time? Why such a large difference in the two accounts between how long the flood lasted (in the Bible Noah and his family don’t exit the Ark for a year, while Utnapishtim seems to spend only two weeks or a little more on the cubical boat). Why doesn’t the Genesis account include the swallow? Why does Gilgamesh say that one of the gods is unaware of the survivors?</p>

<p>The skeptic who insists that Genesis plagiarized Gilgamesh is then obligated to account for the various and serious differences. Once it is admitted, and it must be, that the Genesis account had some other source than Gilgamesh for those differences (i.e. God), then it must be conceded that the Genesis account could also have gotten all the details from that source, including the ones that are similar to the Babylonian poem.
How do you account for these differences?  Historically it makes no sense that Gilgamesh is the source if there are so many differences.  This isn’t the difference between a story in Matthew and a story from Marks point of view…but a difference between the origin of the flying spaghetti god and the actual God of the bible.
Genesis wasn’t the first written book in all of history, so if there was a world wide flood you would expect other cultures to have the same flood story ,but with differences since they didn’t have the same source.  Note “There are over 200 flood legends in different cultures all over the world” </p>

<p>Here’s another article that goes into detail on the Gilgamesh vs. the bible <a href="http://www.icr.org/article/noah-flood-gilgamesh/">http://www.icr.org/article/noah-flood-gilgamesh/</a>
2)  There is not enough water ON OR IN this planet in ANY form for it to have happened. The only way for God to flood the entire planet such that it covered the highest mountain- which, by the way, is Mount friggin&#39; Everest at approx. 8,850 meters (29,035 feet) above sea level- is if he magicked it into existence, and then magicked it out of existence when he was done.</p>

<p>Tl/dr this is an incorrect assumption that the pre flood topography is the same as now.  Also, there are marine fossils on every mountain, including Everest.  If there was a worldwide flood, much of the worlds topography would have changed since.<br/>
<a href="http://www.icr.org/article/did-noahs-flood-cover-himalayan-mountains/">http://www.icr.org/article/did-noahs-flood-cover-himalayan-mountains/</a>
Mt. Everest and the Himalayan range, along with the Alps, the Rockies, the Appalachians, the Andes, and most of the world&#39;s other mountains are composed of ocean-bottom sediments, full of marine fossils laid down by the Flood. Mt. Everest itself has clam fossils at its summit. These rock layers cover an extensive area, including much of Asia. They give every indication of resulting from cataclysmic water processes. These are the kinds of deposits we would expect to result from the worldwide, world-destroying Flood of Noah&#39;s day.
<a href="http://creationtoday.org/where-did-the-water-come-from-to-flood-the-earth/">http://creationtoday.org/where-did-the-water-come-from-to-flood-the-earth/</a>
3) Speaking of Everest, the tip of that thing is so high up, that if God really did flood the planet about twenty feet above that, Almost everything on the ark would freeze to death. Anything that didn&#39;t freeze would die of exhaustion and/or suffocation because of reduced air pressure lowering the amount of available oxygen by about 33%.
Pre flood topography, different see point #2.  Nothing would freeze to death.<br/>
4)  Let&#39;s talk about that water now. That much water will cause massive changes to water pressure, light filtration, the temperature of the water, and don&#39;t even get me started on salt and fresh water inevitably mixing. Nearly everything UNDER the water would die.
95% of all fossils are fish.  Most fish did die…but read this:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.icr.org/article/fish-flood/">http://www.icr.org/article/fish-flood/</a></p>

<p>In the complex of events and conditions that made up the Flood, certainly there were pockets of fresh water at any one time. Remember, it was raining in torrents, and we can expect that the rain water was fairly fresh. Many studies have shown that waters of various temperatures, chemistries, and sediment loads do not tend to mix; they tend to remain segregated in zones. It would be unlikely for any one area to retain such zones for very long during the tumult of the Flood, but on a worldwide scale, some such segregated zones would have existed at any given time.
Some fish lived due to these segregated zones.</p>

<p>5)  There&#39;s simply not enough space on the ark. Even if Noah only took two of every unclean animal, seven of the clean, and cut out all the variation and stuck to the bare minimum so that &quot;micro evolution&quot; could do its thing, guess what? There&#39;s still not enough room in the big wooden box for all of them.
There was plenty of room, you should research it…start here:

Was every species on the ark? No! From chapters such as Leviticus 11, it is obvious that the created kind (min in Hebrew, in Genesis 1:11–12, 21, 24–25) was a much broader category than the modern term of classification, species. Current baraminological2 research suggests that the created kind most closely corresponded to the family level in current taxonomy. However, to be conservative in this study, the genus was set as equivalent to the original created kind. As for the clean animals that entered the ark in seven pairs, this added a modest number of additional animals, notably bovids (cow-like mammals) and cervids (deer-like mammals). Under these conservative assumptions, there were no more than 16,000 land animals and birds on the ark.</p>

<p>According to the Bible, the ark had three decks (floors). It is not difficult to show that there was plenty of room for 16,000 animals
6) Speaking of tight squeezes, let&#39;s talk about food and water. The largest animals ALONE eat several hundred tons of food in a year per individual. If there&#39;s not enough room on the ark for the animals, there&#39;s DEFINITELY no room for the food. And what about the water? Sure it&#39;s only gonna rain for forty days, but the flood itself is gonna last a whole year, so what the hell is Noah gonna do about water for the next 325 days?
From the same source:
<a href="https://answersingenesis.org/noahs-ark/how-could-noah-fit-the-animals-on-the-ark-and-care-for-them/">https://answersingenesis.org/noahs-ark/how-could-noah-fit-the-animals-on-the-ark-and-care-for-them/</a>
We must distinguish between the long-term care required for animals kept in zoos and the temporary, emergency care required on the ark. The animals’ comfort and healthy appearance were not essential for emergency survival during one stressful year, where survival was the primary goal.
Studies of non-mechanized animal care indicate that eight people could have fed and watered 16,000 creatures. The key is to avoid unnecessary walking around. As the old adage says, “Don’t work harder, work smarter.”
Therefore, Noah probably stored the food and water near each animal. Even better, drinking water could have been piped into troughs, just as the Chinese have used bamboo pipes for this purpose for thousands of years. The use of some sort of self-feeders, as is commonly done for birds, would have been relatively easy and probably essential. Animals that required special care or diets were uncommon and should not have needed an inordinate amount of time from the handlers. Even animals with the most specialized diets in nature could have been switched to readily sustainable substitute diets.</p>

<p>7) Let&#39;s assume everything on the boat survives, though. What then? There&#39;s no plant life left for the herbivores to eat- guess what? Land-based plants don&#39;t do so well under thirty thousand feet of water- and the carnivores will inevitably eat them into oblivion, thereby killing their own species&#39; as well.
When do you assume they ran out of food on the ark?  Where in the story does it say they ran out?  They had enough for 1 year at least…and even if they were running out…as the land dried they were still in the ark…and left when there was dry land.  Therefore, the sun and soil could definitely sprouted plantlife when drying.<br/>
<a href="http://b4answers.blogspot.com/2013/05/after-flood-how-did-animals-from-noahs.html">http://b4answers.blogspot.com/2013/05/after-flood-how-did-animals-from-noahs.html</a>
Plants: Noah, his family, and the animals remained in the Ark for about 7 ½ months as the land dried (and as the plants grew) until God instructed him to leave the Ark. There was an Olive that had sprouted into leaf before they left the ark (8:11) and certainly the grasses grow even more rapidly having quite a head start in that warm sun and soft soil. It should also be noted that the soil would have had many water-borne nutrients deposited in it as a result of the flood. I can testify to how tall the grass in my neighbor’s backyard grew after 7 ½ months of not being mowed, even despite the bad soil!
8) Now let&#39;s talk about genetic variation. Two individuals- hell, SEVEN individuals- isn&#39;t nearly enough to propagate an entire species. Bare minimum for proper genetic diversity in a species is 50 individuals. With only two or seven, you&#39;re gonna get a LOT of inbreeding. And with that much inbreeding going on, there&#39;s going to be a LOT of genetic defects going on, which will eventually kill the species anyway.
There’s enough time, for humanity….easily:
<a href="http://creation.com/where-are-all-the-people">http://creation.com/where-are-all-the-people</a>
 It is relatively easy to calculate the growth rate needed to get today’s population from Noah’s three sons and their wives, after the Flood. With the Flood at about 4,500 years ago, it needs less than 0.5% per year growth.6 That’s not very much.
The first people on earth…the first man and woman…they had kids…who did those kids procreate with? Themselves.  How else did man or any other animal procreate. </p>

<p>This article may also help with the other obvious questions: <a href="http://creation.com/noah-and-genetics">http://creation.com/noah-and-genetics</a>
9) And finally, the pièce de résistance, the biggest quesiton: How the fake hell did the animals get TO the ark AND back to where they lived without drowning in the oceans, dying of exhaustion (or becoming so exhausted that they drowned), or just straight up getting killed by something, all without leaving any evidence that they went anywhere?
As far as coming to the Ark, that’s a ‘God did it’ answer:<br/>
<a href="http://www.christiananswers.net/q-aig/aig-c006.html">http://www.christiananswers.net/q-aig/aig-c006.html</a>
Skeptics paint a picture of Noah going to countries remote from the Middle East to gather animals such as kangaroos and koalas from Australia, and kiwis from New Zealand. However, the Bible states that the animals came to Noah; he did not have to round them up (Genesis 6:20). God apparently caused the animals to come to Noah. The Bible does not state how this was done.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>1) A plagiarism doesn&#39;t have to be an exact copy.  Stories, myths, legends, religions, and even languages evolve all the time as information is added, removed, or changed.  Do try again.</p>

<p>2) Mount Everest is 250 million years old.  If God wanted to go twenty feet above the highest mountain top, he would have to go above Everest.  Also, the marine fossils argument incorrectly assumes that there is no other way those fossils could have gotten up those mountains.  For instance, what if those fossils were already in the ground when the mountains were formed?  That would certainly explain how they got up there.</p>

<p>3) Point still stands as strong and high as Everest.</p>

<p>4) Chemical mixing of various water types might not happen as often as I thought, I&#39;ll grant you that, but this fails to account for everything else that I listed, such as light filtration and water pressure.  With enough water to cover even Mount Everest, I&#39;m not even sure the Cloverfield monster could survive the bottom of the ocean under that much pressure, and a lot of us are sure it survived that vacuum bomb at the end of the movie.</p>

<p>5) Okay, first, there are no &quot;kinds.&quot;  &quot;Kind&quot; is a term that is intentionally left vague so that Ken Ham and his ilk can change its definition whenever and however they see fit during debates like this.  If you could scientifically define the word &quot;kind,&quot; even then this argument would only show that Ham knows evolution is a fact.</p>

<p>But let&#39;s go ahead and say that the ark was big enough for 16K land animals and birds.  Does this include insects?  Arachnids?  Slugs?  Snails?  Parasitic organisms like tape worms?  What about microscopic diseases?  I mean, obviously there&#39;s room for them, but how does everything on the ark not die from these things?</p>

<p>And what about the food and water?  Noah and his family would have to store enough food and water on the ark for every single one of those animals and for themselves for an entire year.  When you take that into account, there&#39;s still not enough room in the ark.  The only way this could have worked is if the thing were TARDIS.</p>

<p>And you still have to answer the question of what the animals are going to do about food AFTER the flood has subsided, since literally all land-based plant life will have died.  The herbivores will have nothing to eat, and the carnivores will quickly drive their prey, and by extension themselves, to extinction.</p>

What&#39;s eight people gonna do about THAT MUCH animal waste for a whole year if the only way they&#39;re gonna fit that many animals onto the ark, given its dimensions in the Bible, is if it was magical or a TARDIS?</p>

<p>In case you don&#39;t recognize the term, TARDIS stands for &quot;Time And Relative Dimensions In Space.&quot;  It&#39;s a type of ship in the popular British sci-fi series &quot;Doctor Who&quot; that can travel through space and time.  It&#39;s literally bigger on the inside, too, but that&#39;s because it&#39;s basically an alternate dimension.</p>

In my opinion, a half-truth is the WORST kind of lie.  That&#39;s right, God LIED.

<p>For <strong>by grace are ye saved through faith</strong>; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God: <strong>Not of works</strong>, lest any man should boast. —Ephesians 2:8,9</p>

<p>Ye see then how that <strong>by works a man is justified, and not by faith only.</strong> —James 2:24</p>

<p>Here&#39;s another one:</p>

<p>Jehoiachin was <strong>eighteen years old</strong> when he began to reign, and he reigned in Jerusalem three months. And his mother&#39;s name was Nehushta, the daughter of Elnathan of Jerusalem. —2Kings 24:8</p>

<p>Jehoiachin was <strong>eight years old</strong> when he began to reign, and he reigned three months and ten days in Jerusalem: and he did that which was evil in the sight of the Lord

    <div class="md"><p>My faith in the bible is based on evidence.   I belive in Newtons 2nd law.  I believe that without supernatural forces, nothing will always be nothing.</p>

<p>I believe that there are enough historical texts thst prove the bible to be real.  I believe that combined with prophies that came through and archaeological evidence that the bible being real is the biggest conspiracy there is.</p>

<p>Its no wonder that when u uncover politics...you find molech worship.   When u uncover freemasonry....baal or satan worship....the...e.u and the u.n....the same.. ..its all from the same paganism that is in the bible.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, changes to physical attributes have been observed but not changes in species.  For example, your pet rabbit has four babies in the wintertime and one turns out to be a hamster - never happens.  However, for the theory of evolution to be correct then cross species transformations would be taking place on a daily basis.  Darwin himself denounced his own theory on his deathbed - his realization was that there was just too much perfect symbiosis for things not to have developed in unison (rather than at different paces as his theory suggested).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What? How can you not even have the most basic fundamental understanding of natural selection? It&#39;s been observed in white and black moth populations in coal towns during the industrial revolution.. the trees in the town got covered in black coal soot and all the white moths stood out against the black background and were eaten by birds so only the black moths survived.  This happened for a few generations until there were no white moths left with the genetic code to breed more white moths. One or two will still pop up each generation due to random genetic mutation, and if the trees are ever white again, they are the ones that survive, so the white gene will be bred back in. Simple, get it?<br/>
It does happen all the time, it&#39;s a constant process within all populations of species, it&#39;s been observed. I don&#39;t understand why you would even think it&#39;s not happening all the time. Your points are frankly nonsense.
Don&#39;t need no bullshit gods. Religion and magical thinking is a tool for powerful people to keep the unwashed masses under control, it&#39;s time to let it go.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Nobody said natural selection was fake.  What you are arguing for, or attempting to at least, is for the theory of evolution.  Now, this theory says we all started off as single cellular organisms and evolved from there.  This simply does not happen.  You do not see single cellular organisms becoming more complex over time.  You do not see monkeys becoming humans.  This would still be happening if this theory was correct.  However, cross species conversion or the theory of evolution is false:  shit simply does not happen.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m actually flabbergasted at how ignorant this post is.  The entire fossil record is like a giant timeline of evolution.  We can very definitively see how mammals evolved from reptiles, which evolved from amphibians, which evolved from fish, etc.  Funghi actually have more similarity to the animal kingdom because they separated a couple hundred million years after plants did.  Whales still retain finger bones in their fins from when they were land mammals.  Humans still have vestigial organs that were used to digest fibrous plant matter when we were monkeys..  I could literally go on ad infinitum because evolution is a ubiquitous, constant process that is inextricably linked to biological life.</p>

<p>What does happen, over millions of years, is the fish starts crawling out of the water on its fins to catch insects on the beach, each generation having some tiny survival advantage for doing this, passing on those genes and reinforcing that adaptation (evolution).   Those fins are slowly transforming over thousands of generations into little legs.  One day, one descendent is not a fish anymore and doesn&#39;t go back in the water.</p>

<p>How about this, can you concisely write out the evolution of man.  I dont care about time periods...just something simple like the following:</p>

<p>Firrst was nonlife and that evolved into <em>__, and they evolved into _</em><em>, and they evolved into _</em>__, and they evolved into man.</p>

<p>Keep in mind for evolution to work both a male and female has to evolve at the same time in the same area and they have to find each other and copulate.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Evolution works slowly.  It is adaptation over many thousands of generations that produce substantial change.  the difference between a chiwawa and a German Shepard is one of adaptation.  The genetic differences between one generation and the next are slight, insignificant.  They are small natural variances that become amplified through advantageous adaptation.  Both the male and the female of each generation are within standard statistical deviations from average.  So are the children.  It&#39;s just that certain attributes carry reproductive advantages for the entire species in whatever reproductive niche they are found in and that vectors the transmission of those advantageous genes over many generations towards adaptations that may eventually result is significant morphological change.</p>

<p>I believe in God, my friend, but I also believe that this universe that we inhabit was infused with the beauty of physics by the hand of that creator.  We don&#39;t need him to design a frog, and he doesn&#39;t have to do that.  His design was even more profound and more elegant.  He designed the physics, knowing the frog, and trillions of other beautiful things, would sprout like flowers from his creation.</p>

<p>It&#39;s a far more beautiful artwork when seen this way.</p>

<p>The org started at the fall from heaven.  It was made known to man either at the garden or at the tower of babel.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>if you&#39;re being serious....then I will reply seriously. read on.</p>

<p>the biggest problem with modern science especially modern science is it is stuck in a pre-conceived notion of how things should be more or less and these things when it comes to God and spirits and whatnot....always come from a &quot;they cannot possibly ever be real no matter what perspective&quot;.</p>

<p>evolution is very very anti-God for  example. and I do not mean because it clashes with the created in 6 days or whatever other creation story you might have....I mean because it completely ignores the even slightest possibility in favor a God like being existing. going so far as to suppose that 4534534534 perfectly aligned coincidences occurred....you would have better odds in las vegas.</p>

<p>concerning things like hallucinations.....just because YOU can&#39;t see it....does that make them all fake? I&#39;ve never personally seen a shark, yet i rely on the eye witness testimony of others who have seen sharks. the same thing with the earth being round....yet we have the same number of eye witnesses that verify there is a God and a spirit world....why do you value one over the other? you are selectively picking one over the other based on the aforementioned preconceived notion that there cannot be a God or spirits. the burden then falls on you to explain why the scientist&#39;s opinion trumps the priests opinion. Priests too have created countless documentaries and journals about exorcisms often following a similar methodology as science to make sure they are dealing with an actual demon.</p>

<p>i dont remember the name of this mental illness but there is one that is fairly well documented where people can see 5 feet above their bodies in some sort of weird trance or something. i forget the name of it. yet it is  mental disorder in its classification and not a spiritual problem. </p>

<p>the earth is ripe with cultures that have no end of odd stories about spirits....are all these stories universally false? I mean that in and of itself is a bold claim. </p>

<p>take for instance the UFO phenomenon....in a court of law you only need a handful of witnesses to create a case against someone, yet we have millions upon millions of people claiming to have been abducted. same with witnesses to the spirit world or God or Christ or whoever else(for the sake of this argument here Im not specifiying anyone deity) and science tosses them out the window as false or hallucinations....yet in a court of law this would be a clear case that the spirit world does exist. if God was on trial with the case being do you really exist....God has countless witnesses in his favor. </p>

<p>what I am saying is, if you apply a common set of rules beyond just the scientific method....suddenly it becomes very plausible.</p>

<p>so you have two claims with vast amounts of research.....why do you universally toss out the religious claims so readily and easily? </p>

<p>skepticism is good....and i do not discourage questions....however i write this is posing questions to get you to open your mind a little bit and ask why you think the way you do. </p>

<p>since i cannot get a spirit to manifest directly in front of you nor do i have an overwhelming desire to even try to do that if i could.....but if you have interacted with the spirit world and angels and demons you know it is a very real thing. getting choked by an unseen hand or things levitating or other things happening that science claims is impossible....you realize that this is no joke.</p>

<p>if you want to find out about God....He has left His witness to many....the question is what will we do with that witness? you want to learn about God and spirits....you are going to have to research it with a completely open mind a broken and contrite spirit if you will....not coming in with a preconceived notion.</p>

<p>yes some of us are liars....it is true....but are we all lying about this? are all 100 million of us or whatever telling the same lie for the LOLz? </p>

<p>if you want proof of what is actually in the rabbit hole....you are going to have to actually go down the rabbit hole. until you are ready for that....there are no end to journals and documentaries and eye witnesses on the matter. same thing with scientific theories. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>you missed the point is completely valid when someone misses it</p>

<p>if i say yes they are real you will blast me as crazy because imaginary friends must be imaginary. </p>

<p>if i say no, then and only then will you have read what i wrote and call me a liar and a hypocrite and attempt to use my own words against me.</p>

<p>this is obvious as you have pigeon holed the entire conservation onto one question and have a predetermined response depending on what i say.</p>

<p>i will ask you why are you so against spirits existing? what bothers you about their potential existence?  like the atom, we never knew it existed until recently but when viewed correctly suddenly atoms are a very real thing. spirits could be like that. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The theory is that basically somewhere far in the history of &#39;civilised&#39; humanity some people came together with the intent to control and mold society for the good of themselves [some say for the good of all, but that&#39;s subjective in itself]. They go by many names. Some evidence points interesting places, some is utter bullshit, some is classic misdirection. Nothing has been proven, but groups like bilderberg certainly raise eyebrows, and with past events and learning from our history, there&#39;s much reason to be suspicious. But skepticism is important as well. Most of the stuff people are saying in this thread is pretty much 100% bullshit. Do your own research, think RATIONALLY, and question EVERYTHING. Come to your own hypotheses, and discuss them with others. That&#39;s how we learn and solve problems. Best to you.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It literally goes back to Atlantis and the &quot;fall&quot; wherein false gods and godesses and their followers rebelled and ended up destroying Atlantis and relocated to Babylon and then egypt, the Hebrew patriachs were actually pharoas who were apart of these satanic bloodlines and who wrote the bible to cover up history and the actual origin of &quot;the fall&quot;. Lucifer is an actual being who was the main false God and who along with his mate &quot;isis&quot; has literally reincarnated over and over again with the help of his followers and genetically manipulated ET minions as osiris, zues, mithra, apollo, shiva, quetzleqoutle, and, of course yahweh. Lucifer is &quot;jesus&quot; who never existed as the bible says. Lucifer and Jesus are both referred to as the bright and morning star and have the same numerical gemotria...him and his mate have created much of this &quot;world&quot; which is really a holographic matrix into which we have incarnated to help end. And which is ending this year, as has been prophesied by many...this is it, the satanic masons and vatican, along with their &quot;jewish&quot; bankers are all part of these ancient bloodlines which are linked to Isis and Osiris. These false gods are losing power fast and are unable to stop the Destiny of all to return back to love and infinity </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I just want to point out one thing here. It&#39;s not &quot;this same organization&quot;. Certainly, there is a relatively small group of families that have maintained power and wealth for hundreds of years and some of those families have been protected from prosecution in all kinds of heinous crimes. However, the biggest misunderstanding in all these conspiracies is the idea of the &quot;illuminati&quot; style NWO group that plot about how to take over the world and ruin your day (and yes I&#39;m aware of Jekyll Island). It doesn&#39;t take intentional evil acts to perpetrate them. All it takes is a couple cops that look the other way, a couple politicians that take a few bribes, a couple lawyers that take clients they shouldn&#39;t and it can add up to some really fucked up shit. Now that it&#39;s been going on for so long, there are a lot of people involved and it looks like a giant web of criminals and crooked politicians, but I guarantee if you could read their mind, none of them would think of themselves as involved in a millennia old organization.</p>

<p>TL/DR; Despite all the History Channel shows about how terrible the Nazis were, the #1 deadliest weapon in causing the Holocaust was bureaucracy. The big evil organization is not required to commit the most horrible crimes in history anymore.</p>

<p>The bible is a game of telephone where at the very least you can ask the 2nd person who heard the story.   Its literally astounding how it has held up in time compared to any historical ancient documents...from homer to knowledge of alexander the great to knowledge of ceasar...the bible got them all beat.</p>

<p>I never needed to know that the earth was an oblate spheroid.  I was never taught that in school and you are the first person i have ever seen write that.  I was told the earth is round by my non secular public school.  I dont think they are wrong.  </p>

<p>I would like to preface this with a disclaimer that I am in no way an expert but the occult and its teachings are something that I truly enjoy and I have dedicated my life to the study of it. With that being said I try to show people what I have learned because there seems to be an overwhelming stigma and fear attached to occult teachings casting them off as &quot;satantic&quot; and &quot;evil&quot; which is simply not the case. Like any great knowledge it can be wielded to enslave you or used as a great gift to set you free. The more you know about these teachings the more you can stand in confidence when those who wish to keep you enslaved in fear try to use them to your detriment. Unveil these hidden truths and inspire an apocalypse of the soul and you too can awaken the Christ within. After all occult simply means hidden.  </p>

<p>Essentially both these symbols are used in whats called &quot;ceremonial magic/magick&quot; and Alchemy. Many, if not all, occult teachings contain the study of ceremonial magick and Alchemy. Whether it be Thelema, Wicca, The Qabbalah, Free Masonry, Rosicrucianism, Hindu mysticism or The Templars. I won&#39;t go into the process and practice of ceremonial magic here unless someone is interested.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://imgur.com/a/KgnG7">pentagram</a> is an ancient symbol used in the magical arts by alchemists, magicians and sorcerers and signifies the five properties of the Great Magical Agent, The Great Astral Light, the five elements of nature, the five senses of man, and the five extremities of the human body. What we must keep in mind is that while this symbol itself is not evil it is the <a href="http://imgur.com/a/uIHJs">perversion</a> of it that makes it left handed. When it is flipped on its head this symbol becomes to the magician or sorcerer a form of &quot;black magic&quot; and therefore a means of evil. In symbolism an inverted or distorted figure always means that it is being misused. To the adept of the dark arts an inverted pentagram is called the &quot;sign of the cloven hoof&quot;. The upright star with its point turned down signifies the fall of the morning star. So be wary of anyone rocking this image. I can recall a time when I met someone with an inverted pentagram tattooed on his shoulder. I approached him and asked if he practiced magic. He had no idea what I was talking about. I pointed out the perverted symbol that donned his arm and he laughed casting it off as something he got on a whim to scare to people. Little did he know what dark spirits he was invoking by using this distorted image. I simply smiled, nodded and exclaimed he should look into it further. </p>

<p><a href="http://imgur.com/a/az6ZD">Baphomet</a> has an interesting history which can be dated back to the Templars. Many believed they worshiped this image as an idol but that is up for debate. Today we see <a href="http://imgur.com/a/bxgJc">it</a> used by the self proclaimed &quot;Satanic Temple&quot; Take note of the pentagram in both representations. The latter is inverted.  Again it is a symbol used to communicate certain truths about the visible and invisible universe which when understood can again be used for great evil or great good. We see in Baphomet a hermaphorditic humanoid with a goats head, wings and cloven feet. This type of hybrid imagery has been used by all ancient clutures and priest crafts whether it be the sphinx in the priestcraft of the Egyptians or the winged cherubs of Judeo Christianity. In the work titled &quot;The Book Of Splendours&quot; Elphas Levi explains Baphomets rather odd and bizarre appearance succinctly with this passage.</p>

<p>“[Baphomet] is a knowledge rising in opposition to idolatry, protesting though the very monstrosity of the idol. The Israelites were forbidden to give divine concepts the figure of a man or of any animal; thus, on the ark of the covenant and in the sanctuary, they dared sculpt only cherubs, that is, sphinxes with the bodies of bulls and the heads of men, eagles or lions. These mixed figures reproduced neither the complete form of any man, nor that of any animal. These hybrid creations of impossible animals gave to understand that the image was not an idol or reproduction of a living thing, but rather a character or representation of something having its existence in thought. Baphomet is not worshipped; it is God who is worshipped, this faceless God behind this formless form, this image which resembles no created being. Baphomet is not a God; He is the sign of initiation.” [5]</p>

<p>His right hand points to the white moon his left to the black. The dual nature of the astral light is also reflected in the alchemical formula “Solve et Coagula:” These two operations are represented by the words written on the arms of Baphomet: SOLVE, to dissolve, to project, to move; and COAGULA, to coagulate, to concentrate, to fix. The image has breasts and the caduceus rising from the groin which represents the union of opposites. The masculine and the feminine united in equilibrium. The progenitive caduceus being the ancient sign of genesis rising betwixt the life giving breasts where all who are born unto this human form succor for nourishment. The torch rising from the top of his head is the illuminated mind. The pineal gland fully awakened. The third eye opened and aware of the self peering deeply into the mystery of mysteries.</p>

<p>Do not fear these images and symbols my friends. Rather take and eat of the fruits of knowledge that the great serpent guards. It is your duty to rise from darks depths of ignorance and storm the gates of illumination saying &quot;I&#39;ve come home now!&quot; Break the shackles that have enslaved you and you too can, as Morpheus said to Neo, &quot;free your mind.&quot; The world is ruled by symbols. Understand them and you can rule your world.    </p>
