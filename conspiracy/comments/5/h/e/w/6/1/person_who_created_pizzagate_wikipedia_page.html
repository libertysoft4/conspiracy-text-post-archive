    <div class="md"><p>Yeah someone else just actually debunked one of the alleged codes for me, or at least debunked it in regards to its use in one of the emails. The hotdog stand in Hawaii is just an inside joke dating back as far as 2000. </p>

<p>Last paragraph.</p>

<p>So that&#39;s somewhat of a relief. Why don&#39;t actual fucking journalists go through and do this stuff? Like actually debunk instead of triggering people like me who were abused as kids? Getting triggered by trolls, and then the MSM just points and laughs instead of explaining, just like people who were abused as kids were not believed. This whole thing has been an exhausting shitfest rollercoaster. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>They were quoting his brother, who said it, it wasn&#39;t the Washington Post&#39;s own words. Not a fan of the Post but still, it wasn&#39;t their own words. That nobody I have seen has been mentioning that joke from back in 2000 when using the email as a piece of evidence, though, makes me more suspicious of everything else. I mean what is the story behind all of the other examples, that I might not have stumbled upon yet? I already know the MSM isn&#39;t trustworthy at all, but it seems there might be some bullshit afoot with this, as well. Which if so really pisses me off, since child predators in governments is a very real issue, we don&#39;t need people drumming up distorted half-truths that could make it harder future victims to be taken seriously. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s not the point of my posts. The point of my posts is that the information relevant to the email about a hotdog stand has not been included by anyone I have seen showing that email as evidence for reason to be suspicious. I&#39;m only of average intelligence, you see, and when reading about a topic that is triggering for me, like I actually have PTSD, I become even less intelligent due to the fight/flight response. Hence I did not think to do searches that would have brought up the article for me a long time ago. So I can only conclude that the people doing the investigations are either also not that bright if they did not think to look it up, or they deliberately don&#39;t include it so as to deliberately not have any context for the email when they use it as evidence. Those are the only two possibilities and neither of them are good.</p>

<p>It&#39;s not the media&#39;s fault that you believed a load of old rubbish, it&#39;s not the media&#39;s role to address every single piece of crap on the internet, and it&#39;s not the job of journalists to provide you with a therapeutic reading experience.</p>

<p>The question you ought to be asking yourself is: &quot;Why on earth did I believe self-evident total nonsense from a completely anonymous stranger with no credentials, and why did I make no effort to check?&quot;</p>

<p>You are a victim in this, but not in the way you seem to imagine. You are a victim because you chose to listen to idiots, and unless you learn to be a bit more discriminating, you&#39;ll be a victim again. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>But what about everyone else who believes some ridiculous crap they read online? Why do you (pizzagaters, not you personally) get preferential treatment? And why do you (personally) get preferential treatment out of all the other pizzagaters who want to see some other item of &#39;evidence&#39; addressed?</p>

<p>You can see where this is going. The media&#39;s job is to report on things that are actually happening. So far the only &#39;thing&#39; that has happened as part of pizzagate is that gunman incident. There is literally nothing else to report, unless you want media debased to the level at which twitterstorms are the stuff of headlines.</p>

<p>Perhaps there will be some exhaustive pizzagate debunking documentary in the near future. There&#39;s enough interest for a potential audience-winner. But true pizzagaters will dismiss it as part of the cover-up. So it won&#39;t accomplish much.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Personally, my hope has been that pizzagate will increase public awareness / concern over child predator activity and coverups in powerful governments. That there might have been a small surge in that from the MSM, as well. </p>

<p>And like I said, the media has gone out of their way to talk about pizzagate but only to call it fake in order to support the &quot;fake news is dangerous&quot; narrative that has suddenly surged.

<p>it took a while for 9/11 conspiracy theories to catch on.  Alex Jones and his crowd was a bit more limited.  Loose Change was probably the first mainstreaming/ popularizing of the concept.</p>

<p>i think the media doesn&#39;t want to spend time debunking when they can just discredit and talk down. that&#39;s what works- it&#39;s the same strategy used against skeptics of GMO/ Global Warming Vaccines and all those &quot;anti-science&quot; concepts.  Just lable the people who question or criticize as crazy or stupid or dangerous.</p>

<p>but I agree that this community needs to be debunking their own concepts if they want to create a more coherent framework for their narrative.  There is too much bs in the pizzagate story and it does a disservice to the larger problems.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>A fair question, and an interesting area in any case, so I&#39;ll unpack some stuff here.</p>

<p>What&#39;s changed between 9/11 and now is that on 9/11 the US wasn&#39;t in the early stages of a superpower confrontation, in which the opponent was making good use of information (be that media material or digital data).</p>

<p>There&#39;s no need to fight a propaganda war against an enemy that has just devastated a city landmark, and what&#39;s more since the enemy are basically shepherds equipped with cellphones hiding somewhere in a third world country, there&#39;s no effective way of doing it either.</p>

<p>The internet was just getting going properly (OK, the WWW but I don&#39;t care for the distinction these days). Al-Qaeda was a very retro terrorist body, as you might expect from such Cold War leftovers, and although they used the internet to propagate material and make announcements, they weren&#39;t great adapters to the digital age.</p>

<p>Bin Laden put up a video of a defiant speech, the media reported it, and we all moved on. Rinse and repeat.</p>

<p>Putin&#39;s Russia is in a different league, and has the historical &#39;chess mentality&#39; to make good use of the internet (which is now a decade more advanced than it was on 9/11).</p>

<p>There is a lot of history here. But the upshot is that the end of the First Cold War was merely the prelude to the encircling of Russia, and this cranked the Second Cold War into motion - and that&#39;s where we are now. </p>

<p>This is about a bit more than &#39;Bin Laden: Wanted dead or alive&#39;.</p>

<p>Whether or not the Kremlin is really percolating &#39;fake news&#39; into US audiences is neither here nor there, really. The aim is that nothing from Russia will be trusted.</p>

<p>And the big thing that has also changed since 9/11 is the strength of the west&#39;s media. A decade of cost-cutting and cutbacks had already led commentators to observe how weakened the media&#39;s resources and fact-checking had become, even before the 2008 crash. </p>

<p>The western media had become vulnerable to Russian propaganda. The western intelligence agencies exploited that same vulnerability to spread the &#39;fake news&#39; meme, designed to contaminate Russian sources. </p>

<p>And now that meme is backfiring, because it is ironically shining a spotlight on exactly how parlous western news reporting had already become. </p>

<p>The &#39;fake news&#39; meme outbreak is still developing, and it&#39;s not clear how the situation will stabilise, but it looks at least as though &#39;the free press&#39; are going to have been catastrophically injured by supping with the Devil.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I can debunk it pretty easily.</p>

<p>The crux of the Pizzagate argument is the alleged pedophile code in Podesta&#39;s emails. I&#39;m speaking specifically of the code table listed <a href="https://i.sli.mg/eoWIeB.jpg">here</a>. </p>

<p>There is no source attached to that alleged pedophile code, which the table contends is widely used among pedophiles. However, Googling some of the phrases, like &quot;hotdog&quot; for boy and &quot;ice cream&quot; for male prostitute, returns no results except Pizzagate-related articles. </p>

<p>Upon further investigation, I traced the source of this code table to a single random 4chan post. That&#39;s it. Some random 4chan user invented that table out of thin air, and now people blindly assume it&#39;s true. Remove that code table and all of the suspect emails are rendered innocuous. </p>

<p>The connections are shaky at best. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>the Alefantis Instagram</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Is this the one you cherry-picked, out of thousands of images, one or two that showed kids in it? Hardly proof of anything unless you honestly think they&#39;d post the kids they abducted online. Why hasn&#39;t anyone come forward with all the exposure this has gained and said &quot;that&#39;s my kid!&quot; </p>

<blockquote>

<p>Haven&#39;t seen these yet. Looking them up now. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>spirit cooking</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Oh my fucking god, they attended a performance artist&#39;s well-known routine! Someone stop the presses they must be pedophiles!</p>

<blockquote>
<p>sacrificing chickens to Moloch</p>
</blockquote>

<p>From Google it seems to be a random reference to a person in Honorees. No proof such a sacrifice actually took place. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Bill on the Lolita Express</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Well that solves it, he must have fucked kids on that flight!</p>

<blockquote>
<p>a convicted sex trafficker appointed by Clinton getting Laura Silsby out of kidnapping charges and into Amber Alert</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The Secretary of State helps return United States citizens arrested on foreign soil? Say it aint so! And from what I&#39;m reading about that case they were trying to rescue kids after the Haiti earthquake but didn&#39;t have the proper paperwork for it. Zero evidence of child sexual abuse. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>all the people who have turned up dead investigating the Clinton Foundation and its ties to human trafficking</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Out of the tens of thousands of people who believe this crap maybe 10 or so turned up dead, most with a history of mental illness and were found to have killed themselves. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>the traffic camera moving just long enough for a gunman...</p>

<p>The ONLY source for this is a random Voat post two days before the shooting. That voat post offers no evidence, its literally just a guy saying &quot;hey the camera moved!&quot; </p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;i will allow you to investigate your claim and build evidence to support it. &quot;</p>

<p>This is my entire point. Do you not see the irony?  There needs to be EVIDENCE for claims. Extreme claims require extreme evidence. </p>

<p>&quot;Care to share why you are so adamantly supporting the suppression of information? &quot;</p>

<p>I am adamant about information, but not disinformation.  Flimsy and circumstantial evidence led to someone with a gun invading a private business and shooting. This wild goose chase is hurting people based on super casual correlation. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Wow. The dearth of your analytical skills is astounding. </p>

<p>You are making the claim that what the people are discussing is disinformation. You have now made a claim. You are obligated to provide evidence for that claim. </p>

<p>I really like your last bit there. The think about the children statement. Does that one ever work? </p>

<p>The gunman? You just made the claim that he acted because of flimsy and circumstantial evidence. We are going to need evidence of your claim to his reasoning. </p>

<p>And no, media sources dont count as legit sources. They have already been proven unreliable. </p>

<p>So, again, please answer the question why you are arguing so hard against performing an investigation. Especially since, if you are correct, the investigation would exonerate everyone involved. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You speak like someone who wants to be thought of as smart but your reasoning is circular.  You&#39;ve seen my assertions. I believe that evidence is needed to draw conclusions. </p>

<p>Let there be an investigation, I&#39;m not arguing against that. </p>

<p>And lol for arguing &quot;think of the children&quot; isn&#39;t a valid statement. This whole witch hunt is based on saving children from a pedophile ring. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Circular? Would that be because i keep turning what you say around to show you how you are making claims with the same amount of evidence that you are accusing others of? Or would it be because i keep returning to the question you refuse to answer? </p>

<p>Or do you just not understand circular logic? Because i havent used any of my arguments to define my own arguments yet. Nor have i made any statement that anything is true or false beyond the original claim that this has been debunked. </p>

<p>Ill give you that my phrasing is a bit off on that one. I didnt see the irony in that at first. However, i was referring to your appeal to fear. Its not a valid arguing point. Unless you are making the statement that any investigation shoukd be left alone due to any adverse reactions from the public. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think for the public good there should be an investigation. But the irony is there&#39;s so much disinformation out there that if any news media would report that the FBI says there was no evidence of any of the claims no one would believe them anyway. This isn&#39;t a case built in facts, it&#39;s a case built in the gaps of evidence. </p>

<p>I won&#39;t get into the circular logic because it&#39;s detracting from the important point, but if you look into your statements it is there. </p>

<p>You also have a nasty habit of trying to discredit anyone who disagrees with you by calling them names or attempting to discredit them (ad hominem), or their reasoning abilities. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well they could have been.  No chain of custody and many have no DKIM signature.  That means they are text files a hacker gave you and said they came from a guy&#39;s inbox.  They could in fact be altered and yes that&#39;s what anyone who actually was caught would claim too.    I guess that means it&#39;s all opinion as only NSA/FBI could verify that the emails were altered by having a version of the original saved in collected data.</p>

<p>Still good to point this out.  There&#39;s now a claim that the emails contents were altered.  If you could actually prove that, which as I said MIGHT be possible, then you would have your smoking gun that someone was seeking to manipulate the election with false information.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Some parts of them are verified.  On the ones I have examined you could alter the time stamps on the emails to whatever you wanted (on the outside headers), but you could not alter the inside part (body) of the email.  Here&#39;s the thing though, you could compromise the account, send the emails yourself and then change the date.  Many of the emails being pointed to in the Podesta emails are not DKIM verified which means there is no control over the content at all.  I tend to trust the google.com DKIM more than the one from the earlier Clinton emails.  I believe there was a domain (clintonemail or something like that I forget which one it was) that had DKIM that was working in some of the earlier releases.  We do not know the extent to which the earliest email server was compromised.  If admin access was gained, then they could have just signed the emails themselves.  I&#39;d say I believe that the emails that are signed by google&#39;s DKIM were sent using a properly authorized client.  If I were the NSA I&#39;d just go see if they have a record of a single one of these and if I can find one alteration that&#39;s pretty good evidence of tampering.</p>

<p>Like actually debunk instead of triggering people like me who were abused as kids? Getting triggered by trolls, and then the MSM just points and laughs instead of explaining, just like people who were abused as kids were not believed. </p>

<p>It&#39;s not the media&#39;s fault that you believed a load of old rubbish, it&#39;s not the media&#39;s role to address every single piece of crap on the internet, and it&#39;s not the job of journalists to provide you with a therapeutic reading experience.</p>

<p>The question you ought to be asking yourself is: &quot;Why on earth did I believe self-evident total nonsense from a completely anonymous stranger with no credentials, and why did I make no effort to check?&quot;</p>

<p>You are a victim in this, but not in the way you seem to imagine. You are a victim because you chose to listen to idiots, and unless you learn to be a bit more discriminating, you&#39;ll be a victim again. </p>

<p>Use this squalid episode as the basis for personal growth, because it&#39;s the only positive you&#39;re going to get from it.</p>

<p>It&#39;s a disservice to the victims of P-G, to dismiss the whole thing. I&#39;ve personally researched this in depth, and I guarantee if real investigation was done, that this would blow up. </p>

<p>And lol for arguing &quot;think of the children&quot; isn&#39;t a valid statement. This whole witch hunt is based on saving children from a pedophile ring. </p>
