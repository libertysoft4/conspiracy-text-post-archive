        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I am no longer a moderator of <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>. I have decided that this is what is best for me after seeing the state of this place and the total disregard of the rules by (some) of the mods. I am not going to call anyone out specifically, but way more than half of the mod team is in favor of allowing EVERYTHING to flow through this place and have absolutely zero content moderation. I am not a fan of removing content myself. I believe a lot of subs fall victim to overmoderation, and in a place like this you want as little of that as possible.But allowing everything to just flow through here is a recipie for disaster. Let the votes decide is the rallying cry for a lot of people here. I can get behind that 100%, but we need to stay focused and on target here. I am not attacking anyone here in this post so please don&#39;t remove this based on that basis. I just think the users of our sub deserve to know these things. I am no longer your &quot;gatekeeper&quot; as some would put it. I only wanted what was best for this sub and everyone involved. I will take this opportunity to say that I am going to be working on new projects that will probably require a lot more of my time than I can devote if I am busy with moderation duties here. I want to start a documentary film. I want to do things to be more active in the conspiracy investigations circle. I want to really make a name for myself and not just sit behind a computer screen typing my opinions to the world. I am going to be the change I want to see.</p>

<p>I hope that this place does well with the current mod team. One thing I can tell you for sure is that they won&#39;t censor your content at all. And they are usually pretty reasonable about comment removals as well. I wish you all the best. I love you guys.</p>

Then, 3 days ago, and without any discussion with the active mods, he approached the site admins and asked to be given control of <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>....citing the fact that our most senior mod <a href="/u/illuminatedwax">/u/illuminatedwax</a> has not been active for over a year.</p>

<p><a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/redditrequest/comments/5gxsuc/hello_i_have_been_a_moderator_of_rconspiracy_for/">https://np.reddit.com/r/redditrequest/comments/5gxsuc/hello_i_have_been_a_moderator_of_rconspiracy_for/</a></p>

<p>Although <a href="/u/9000sins">/u/9000sins</a> explained to us later that he was doing this as a gift to the sub, it is fair to say that the other mods were not convinced by this explanation. The current mod team work by consensus and mutual trust, and Sins&#39; rogue action was a breach of that trust.</p>

<p>A vote was underway to demote <a href="/u/9000sins">/u/9000sins</a> in the mod order and suspend his privileges, but he saw how the vote was going and decided to resign instead.</p>

<p>He likely is NOT the same person who created the account, and likely is part of the systematic takeover of all reddit subs with any psy op or political exploitative potential. Has already happened on several other subs and is an open secret already.  My own feeling on the behind the scenes puppet masters are us alphabet agencies, fairly recently passed regulation explicitly allows exactly this behavior and activity.   But we dont have to play their game, it has been exposed.  For now strongly suggest move to voat and gab, longer term a new platform might be needed</p>

They&#39;ll come in your house to look around, ask bullshit questions, drug test you and depending on your location they&#39;ll maybe even look into having your kid taken away. Taking shots of Everclear in front of your child wouldn&#39;t warrant an investigation but if you vape cannabis then you&#39;re the most irresponsible parent ever. You could hotbox your house with cigar smoke all damn day and the most DCF would do is just say &quot;maybe stop it plz?&quot;.

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve helped manage other &#39;controversial&#39; subs, and this is essentially how &#39;shill&#39; take-overs occur. Long story short, often &#39;shill takeover&#39; is less &#39;paid shills&#39; (though they are in the mix), but essentially a question of mod power vs reddit / social power. 9000sins is essentially saying reddit power has become derailed and mod power needs more authority.</p>

<p>So what happens in &#39;shill&#39; take over (the long of it), is that &#39;bad information&#39; starts to corrupt or degrade a sub. 9000sins is almost certainly referencing pizzagate, but let&#39;s discuss &#39;memes&#39;. Memes start making front page, degrading sub, along with shit comments.</p>

<p>This forces mods to make a decision : &#39;allow it&#39; or &#39;don&#39;t&#39;. Though Conspiracy ruled allow it, many people choose the &#39;don&#39;t allow it&#39;, model. Now once you choose &#39;don&#39;t allow it&#39;, the question because who decides what is or isn&#39;t allowed? Then this becomes a game of votes, seniority, and fear mongering (this is a big thing with mods lol... or &#39;rulers&#39; - the idea of &#39;peasant uprisings&#39;, and so on).</p>

<p>Does any mod feel more info should be allowed? They are part of the Peasant Rebellion! Ban / Strip them immediately! Are votes not going your way? Invite more mods to swing the vote, and echo chamber! Do I have top authority? Rule in a chaotic fashion, and &#39;revamp&#39; the sub! and so on...</p>

<p>I&#39;m not saying 9000sins was shilling or anything like that, but that his actions could have lead a path toward what users call Shillary but really is more a kin to &#39;a series of bad decisions&#39;, which is partly caused through paid bots or shills, but is primarily caused via the hierarchical mod structure, reddit&#39;s support of bot / gov disruption, and current mindset of &#39;war of mod vs users, users vs shills, mods vs shills&#39;, instead of say... a better model or platform.</p>

<p>I support a very, very low removal policy, and I would have likely agreed with the Conspiracy mod team at large. The reason being NOT because I don&#39;t feel &#39;branding&#39; or whatever is important, but because I don&#39;t believe (especially in a sub like this), I could trust myself, or anyone else, to know remove content in a proper manner. There is simply too much to look through, and the ultimate criteria for removal would come down to &#39;I am familiar with this, or I am not familiar with this&#39;, and having mods remove everything they are unfamiliar with ends up being a LOT of shit, and discourages aggressive info hunting.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve seen a few subs get totally destroyed (participation wise) through even low amounts of user post removal + high bans. However, some mods would argue that low participation is a good thing, so long as the quality of the sub is preserved, but personally I&#39;d say there is too much opportunity for personal bias when one (or very few) decide what is this &#39;quality&#39; you are &#39;preserving&#39;, and for whom?</p>

<p>I guess the reverse metaphor is the neighborhood bar overrun with outsiders. Do you ban them and say &#39;jock / hippie speech&#39; is no longer permitted, or do you adjust in some other way? Many do the former, which creates us vs them discussions ad nauseum.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>As it applies, Wikileaks sub went through the same thing - without getting into too many details, we essentially decided to Denounce Pizzagate. I likely would have agreed with something &#39;akin&#39; to your thought process. However, reddit straight banned <a href="/r/pizzagate">/r/pizzagate</a>, so it&#39;s hard to give them a community since reddit won&#39;t allow it. I&#39;ll just say I understand the predicament. Like ~70% of the front page of Conspiracy is Pizzagate, but this wasn&#39;t an issue while <a href="/r/pizzagate">/r/pizzagate</a> was active.</p>

<p>The most socially accepted policy I&#39;ve used for this process was locking &#39;repeat&#39; threads (say the 3rd thread discussed Pizzagate) while sticking a comment linking to the current &#39;hot&#39; pizzagate thread, as well as Voat for further discussion (which isn&#39;t even in your sidebar).</p>

<p>In either case, it&#39;s a tough decision to arrive at via mod mail, emotions, yadda yadda.</p>

<p>That being said, dismissing it because it&#39;s &quot;just a theory&quot; is against what this sub is about. JFK was assassinated in 1963 and all we have about that are theories.

    <div class="md"><p>I tended to let some of the crazier stuff go, like UFO, Bigfoot, flat earth, hollow earth, etc. I know maybe it doesn&#39;t fit into those categories but I tend to like the sub to have a little more variety than just political conspiracy all day every day. Don&#39;t get me wrong, it&#39;s the biggest issue we face as humanity right now. But I have always believed that <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> was like an umbrella sub that covers all of these subjects and doesn&#39;t leave anything out. Asserting fact in a lot of those subjects is damn near impossible as there are almost no established facts to go on. This made moderating that stuff pretty easy because I mostly just left it alone. It never really gets that much attention anyways. But when you have misleading political conspiracy stories they somehow always rise to the top. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I didn&#39;t want the spot for myself, I simply wanted Illuminatedwax to removed from the top spot seeing as how his account has been inactive for over a year and has not once contributed to the community in any way other than admin type stuff, which we cannot rely on him to do anymore anyways now that his account is dead. It was a security hole that I wanted to see dealt with. I want to see a good mod in the top spot because I was there once, and the amount of power there is huge. I personally want to see Mr.Dong in the top spot because he has proven for years that he is a solid dude who can be trusted with the sub. I hope that my resignation is proof enough that I wasn&#39;t asking for myself.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It does not, you went to the admins instead of talking to the other mods. That reeks of corruption (either from the current mods or yourself). I have severe reservations about pizzagate but watching people behave like you makes me believe there must be something to it. People are acting so abnormally around this specific conspiracy. Not lizards in control of our government, not the moon landing was fake, not the illuminati, not any of those conspiracys were attached like this one. That&#39;s despite the fact that elite pedophilia had been around since the dawn of time. It&#39;s getting harder to dismiss this theory the more it&#39;s attacked. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s not that I don&#39;t want the topic mentioned here. Quite the opposite. I just want to distance ourselves from it a bit more because it&#39;s radioactive. Post all the links you want, but don&#39;t go out and stalk/harass people then post it on youtube and then on reddit. If you must do that stuff at least post it to Voat, then link it. I am not asking that much. I just think a degree of separation is a really good thing here. Reddit is not as free as we all seem to think it is. And the growing list of banned subreddits is a testament to that fact.</p>

<p>I understand your concern about Pizzagate here. I personally think there&#39;s a lot of truth to it, but I also worry that this sub could be removed or quarantined if we aren&#39;t very careful about personal information.</p>

<p>You wanting to lower the amount of pizzagate stuff makes sense and isn&#39;t suspicious. </p>

<p>BUT - I 100% understand why people are suspicious and upset about you going to the admins about removing said inactive mod.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know if you&#39;re telling the truth or not, but some of your answers seem really off to me and don&#39;t make much sense.</p>

<p>Even if you thought you were doing a favor and everyone would be OK with what you did, why wouldn&#39;t you even discuss it with your fellow mods?</p>

<p>Did you at least link them to your request or did the others find out on their own?</p>

<p>Also, considering the fact that we&#39;ve witnessed actual take overs on other subs, if another mod had done the same thing and didn&#39;t tell anyone, wouldn&#39;t <em>you</em> find that suspicious? Especially considering the topic of this subreddit?</p>

<p>Jeez, that&#39;s harsh! All of the current mods in this sub have long and consistent reddit histories. To the best of my knowledge, we are all here voluntarily, in our spare time, just like you are - because we enjoy it. There is no agenda or financial incentive.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Guys, he&#39;s right. Most of us who have been here long enough have seen what&#39;s left of r/conspiracy slowly heading south. There has been a influx of complete and utter shit posts sometimes which makes this place looks so disorganized and retarded. I&#39;m am 100000% for complete transparency but there has to be some kind of moderation of shitposts. One of the biggest shill tactics is to shitpost just they like T_D and what ends up happening is all the real quality post don&#39;t get the attention they deserve. I think it would be a good idea for mods to do a stickied posts for open discussion of the future moderation of r/conspiracy</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The technology sub experience is a relevant case study to weigh outcome of potential strategies. </p>

<p>When news of domestic spying broke the sub was heavily manipulated both from within the mod team and comments to disrupt conversation (nod of appreciation to creq for helping restore some room for conversation out of that mess). It looked like an earlier model of the type of activity we&#39;re seeing through CTR or other groups aimed at disruption. After the initial disruption there was a longer term campaign to divide the community and split it out into multiple other subs. To some degree argument can be made that this approach was successful in splitting and dividing eyes away from a concentrated forum information could be shared quickly, and SOPA-like organized response could be coordinated. </p>

<p>Don&#39;t have many solutions for the problem but it&#39;s worth discussion and some thought at what splitting out of a community might accomplish. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This sub is unlike any other sub. Zero moderation works best for <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> because of the very nature of our cause. Any and all analysis of any subject is to be allowed. Who is anyone as a moderator to decide what the community should or should not discuss? Why would any true conspiracy theorist want any material pruned at all?  Isn&#39;t that why the vote system was designed in the first place? Let us all decide on what&#39;s relevant, together. Everyone has something to contribute when on the earnest journey of finding truth. </p>

<p>Furthermore, this vein of ongoing chatter about how this sub has lost its way, or &quot;heading south&quot;, IMHO, is just another shill argument. If you want to see better posts, then make it your business to create better posts. Instead of spending time complaining, start posting more of what you want to see and allow the community to self-adjust.</p>

<p>A small group of individuals do not get to decide for me what is or what isn&#39;t a shit post. I will think for myself and use the vote system.</p>

<p>Promote what you love instead of bashing what you hate. For all of us baby. </p>

There are many shill accounts lately with 1-5 year account histories of posting NOTHING in conspiracy until the last month or two, and then it&#39;s a flood of concern trolling or outright insults and &quot;zero evidence&quot; shit.

<p>One shill acount in particular where i wasn&#39;t 100% sure if he was legit or not had a post from 1 year ago where (i presume) the original owner was actually instructing someone you could sell your account on Reddit and that his company made their employees do that every so often or something like that. That original dude had a history of posting only on smartphone and biking subreddits for years and all of a sudden since November he is on r/conspiracy concern trolling 24/7. There are too many instances of this stuff on Reddit these days. </p>

Calling them all shills is a great way to close out people and turn them against you, which seems to go against the very concept of this subreddit.  Now I could be wrong but I thought this was a place for discussion and attempting to spread truth, not being insulting to everyone who doesn&#39;t 100% agree with your conclusions.</p>

<p>I&#39;m saying this as someone who didn&#39;t contribute to this sub, or at least I don&#39;t think I did because I&#39;ve been here for years but have one-off posts in a lot of places, before recent events but did lurk here and read things now and then.  I&#39;m highly skeptical of the Pizzagate stuff, like I am of anything until there&#39;s evidence, and that&#39;s what attracted me to this sub.  There&#39;s a lot more attention to this sub as of late, but skimming through some of the posts it seems there&#39;s a decent amount of people who are hostile to anyone that is skeptical.  This is going to turn people off, turn them away, and in general stop people from wanting to listen.</p>

<p>Would you consider the possibility that these are just real people with differing opinions than yours?</p>

<p>Take me, for example. I fit your description perfectly. 8 year account with over 20k karma. Never posted to r/conspiracy until this Pizzagate stuff surfaced.</p>

<p>Why am I here? Because watching Pizzagate go down is like rubbernecking at a car crash, or reading a mystery novel you can&#39;t put down. It&#39;s grotesque, intriguing and so <em>different</em> - it breaks the monotony of my otherwise completely mundane life.</p>

<p>I mean, a secret global pedophile ring! Implicating some of the world&#39;s richest and most powerful people! With the FBI and CIA involved in cover-ups! Right in the midst of a contentious election!</p>

<p>Shit&#39;s intriguing, right? </p>

<p>So I looked into it. Believe me, I know our politicians have the capacity to be corrupt sacks of shit, and I didn&#39;t want to be the dude who just jams his fingers in his ears and sings &quot;la la la&quot; hoping for the best. I hate people who are willfully ignorant - if some heinous shit is going down, I need to know.</p>

<p>I found the now-banned PG subreddit. I went through the evidence in the sticky threads, and in discovery threads that followed over the next few days.</p>

<p>What I found was a mountain of &#39;evidence&#39; that is mostly circumstantial and/or mis-informed. In many cases, I felt the investigations were rooted in heavy confirmation bias from the start (I&#39;m gonna prove these rich powerful people are pedophiles!), and the facts presented were simply warped to reinforce the desired conclusion.</p>

<p>I consider much of the evidence presented to be &quot;weird&quot; or &quot;in poor taste&quot; but it takes a huge leap to go from there to &quot;conclusive evidence of sex with minors.&quot;</p>

<p>Provocative art is just art. </p>

<p>Bathroom graffiti is just graffiti. </p>

<p>A handkerchief map is just a handkerchief with a map on it. You&#39;d find that kind of thing at a gift shop, or on Etsy or whatever.</p>

<p>Pool parties with the kids just means the kids want to swim too. </p>

<p>&quot;Dominos on pizza or pasta&quot; is just a dumb dad joke about whether switching up food courses will make him play better or worse when everyone sits down for their family dominos game (seems to be a yearly tradition).</p>

<p>Alefantis was named 49th most powerful person in DC - not because he is, but because the list was a fluff piece curated by GQ, a fashion magazine. The list also featured baseball players, party planners, actors and hairdressers. Since JA owns a few local community watering holes and has rubbed elbows with political elites, he made the list.</p>

<p>(I&#39;m gonna stop here - I don&#39;t want to get too deep into details or I could be here all night. The point is all of these things are still being cited as smoking gun proof of pedophilia, even when there are eminently more plausible explanations for these things.)</p>

<p>Basically, I think many of the conclusions drawn just operate on confirmation bias and presumption of guilt by association. I have not seen a single piece of hard evidence that convinces me any of the accused parties (Podestas, Clintons, Alefantis) have engaged in pedophilic behavior. Just a whole lot of &quot;what if&quot; and &quot;don&#39;t you find this suspicious?&quot;</p>

<p><strong>So if I don&#39;t believe it...and I&#39;m not a shill...then what am I still doing here?</strong></p>

<p>Because what you call &quot;concern trolling,&quot; I just call legitimate concern. As an empathetic human being, I&#39;m actually concerned. This shit has spilled out into the real world. A dude who owns a pizza place, as well as his employees who are probably young and work for shit pay and hate their jobs anyway, now have to deal with harassment and death threats on a daily basis. Then a guy with a gun comes in and scares the shit out of them, and they have to close the business for a few days and lose a bunch of money. </p>

<p>All because (<em>gasp!</em>) some politicians once held a fundraiser, and ate pizza, at a pizza place, and it turns out that &quot;cheese pizza&quot; means &quot;child porn&quot; in some circles, so everyone who eats pizza must be a pedophile.</p>

<p>This community is pulling out tenuous, poorly-researched accusations against strangers; some people are then using these malicious accusations as excuse to stalk and harass innocent people, both over the phone and in person. </p>

<p>That&#39;s why I&#39;m here: if I can convince just one of you guys to stop harassing innocent people, I&#39;ll be happy. There is a very real danger that employees or patrons could get hurt or killed due to the reckless propagation of these theories. I don&#39;t want the misguided research here to turn into misguided violence in real life. So I&#39;m speaking up.</p>

<p>Note that I&#39;m not telling you to stop looking into it. <strong>Don&#39;t stop doing responsible, unbiased research.</strong> I think the claims about CPP and Alefantis are bogus, but Pizzagate isn&#39;t just about CPP - it&#39;s about (as I understand it) underage sex trafficking on a global scale, and unfathomable cover-ups and abuse of power by elites.</p>

<p>I want to know more about the Podesta-McCann link. </p>

<p>I want to know about Bill Clinton&#39;s flights to Epstein&#39;s island. </p>

<p>I want to know about the circumstances surrounding Monica Peterson&#39;s death.</p>

<p>IMO there are actually legitimate, intriguing questions here that may implicate <strong>individual people</strong> in serious crimes. Clearly with all the high-profile pedophilia busts lately, the world&#39;s most powerful people are capable of sick shit like this. Based on what I have seen, it would not shock me if it turned out someone like Bill Clinton or Tony Podesta had sexual relations with minors. But right now there is no evidence that convinces me this is the case. And even if one person is guilty, that doesn&#39;t implicate the whole tribe by proxy.</p>

<p>Look at it this way - my best friend in high school stole CDs from Borders. That doesn&#39;t make me a thief by association. In the same vein, not everyone who sent an email about grabbing a bite to eat somewhere is a pedophile. Such serious allegations require a higher standard of evidence than &quot;he knows somebody, so he&#39;s guilty too.&quot;</p>

<p>Please, keep doing legitimate research, but stop the witch hunts. And stop calling people &quot;shills&quot; when they&#39;re trying to have a reasonable, civil conversation with you. We are not shills, but skeptics who have looked at the evidence and come to a different conclusion than you have. Pizzagate is in the national media spotlight, and long time redditors are showing up here for the first time to do their research - it makes complete sense we would express our disbelief, especially when the most accessible and digestible &#39;evidence&#39; is so demonstrably false or misleading.</p>

<p>If you truly want to make progress in this investigation, I encourage you to be skeptical of our skepticism in return, and use our feedback to separate the wheat from the chaff. If you filter out the weak and nonsensical arguments we poke holes through, what should remain is a truly compelling body of evidence with which to make your case. </p>

<p>After all, if there really is something to this, eventually you&#39;re gonna need to put together an argument that convinces people who don&#39;t share your opinion. Telling us &quot;GTFO shill&quot; is not exactly the most effective way to do this.</p>

Simply subscribing to the conspiracy mindset one becomes instantly smeared. <strong>This sub is where the smeared come to for support and affirmation that their observations are not &quot;crazy&quot;</strong> We are the outcasts, the ones ridiculed and laughed at, the &quot;conspiracy loonies&quot;, the &quot;waaaay out there&quot; people. You think you&#39;d know that after being here for 6 years. </p>

<p>Entities buying votes and old accounts washes out any popular effort to use the voting system. That was my point. </p>

<p>C: &quot;Most people don&#39;t vote. So it&#39;s actually a small group of individuals who choose what reaches the front page&quot;.
R: &quot;Most people don&#39;t vote&quot; is an unsubstantiated claim. Subsequently, the small group of individuals that choose the content that get to the front page change post to post. The group changes because each and everyone of us feel differently about different content or aren&#39;t available to vote at the time of original posting. It&#39;s not always the same group of people that make the content rise. This only adds credence to my argument as to my original statement. USE THE VOTE SYSTEM. It provides for the most diversity of content and synchronizes users across the world to discuss what truly resonates within those groups.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Exactly.</p>

<p>Is anyone so stupid as to fall for this?</p>

<p>OP&#39;s post, in brief, is this: &quot;The mods are allowing too much pizzagate stuff to be posted, so I&#39;m rage quitting.&quot;</p>

<p>You know it&#39;s true because that&#39;s the only thing that&#39;s been inundating this subreddit recently, while the OP has become active again.</p>

<p>The subtext is that OP is throwing another dart at pizzagate with as much substance as a child screaming, &quot;Nuh uh, you big stupid head!&quot; That&#39;s what this is. That&#39;s what it all is.</p>

<p>Pizzagate is THE conspiracy. It&#39;s the tip of the iceberg for the conspiracy above all others: satanic, perverse, bloodthirsty wickedness at the very top. It&#39;s long been suspected and now there&#39;s a modicum of proof, so they&#39;re firing back with every subversive tactic they have available.</p>

<p>I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if the original person behind OP&#39;s screen name is dead.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you were referring to my post, then I&#39;ll concede ad hominem and appeal to emotion, but I didn&#39;t straw man anyone.</p>

<p>There&#39;s nothing substantial about anything OP said in the original post or in any of his responses throughout the thread. I can&#39;t straw man something without any substance already.</p>

<p>OP said this: &quot;There&#39;s stuff the mods are allowing that I disagree with, and it&#39;s too much of an issue now that I can&#39;t take it anymore and I&#39;m quitting.&quot;</p>

<p>Based on the timing, we must conclude OP is talking about Pizzagate.</p>

<p>Therefore, my supposed straw man of &quot;The mods are allowing too much pizzagate stuff to be posted, so I&#39;m rage quitting,&quot; isn&#39;t a straw man, but it&#39;s exactly what OP said, only more succinct. If there&#39;s some nuance I&#39;m missing, please let me know so I can be informed, otherwise stop patting yourself on the back for knowing a couple of logical fallacies while you misapply that knowledge.</p>

<p>Furthermore, my overall message above isn&#39;t reliant on appeal to emotion and ad hominem, so the mere fact I used them isn&#39;t damning to what I said.</p>

<p>All that being said, I still must agree in part to what the guy you replied to (who apparently deleted the message) said. I think there is a need for other scandals exposed by the leaked emails to be brought to people&#39;s attention.</p>

<p>Having made that concession, I still think OP is a shill and this whole thing is some sort of weird reverse psychology psy op.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I dont recall telling anyone to delete their account, and Im not deleting mine.  In my view I still use reddit in non political, non controversial discussion subs, but anything political or controversial, I dont even bother to try contributing new things, they will be downvoted to the abyss and/or I will be banned (both have happened numerous times, though this sub hasnt banned me), and I am letting my friends and fellow users here in those political/controversial subs that if they think anything is amiss, they are right and in my <strong>opinion</strong> this is what has happened and is happening behind the scenes.   I am certainly not the first to loudly proclaim this.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, yes. I really wish this would have gone the other way. I really want to this place stay around forever, and I hope that this current style of moderation helps that ultimately. As I was told by someone earlier, &quot;I was making a lot of waves around here&quot; lately and that I &quot;needed to leave and not look back&quot;. So I was thinking maybe I should take that advice even though I didn&#39;t really care for who it was coming from or the sentiment behind it. Ultimately in the end mod consensus is really what is good for the sub, so I bowed to the pressure. I really hope this actually helps because my opinions on the direction things should go is a bit different than the majority and I am actually impeding progress by standing in the way. I wish them all the best. And if they are reading this, Sorry if I was nasty in the mod mail. I was just a bit fed up with the tone of the conversation.</p>

<p>I respect your decision to leave the team, but it saddens me as I very much felt we all could have come to terms with a style of moderation that was able to respond to spam while protecting the free exchange of ideas sans compromise.</p>

This should have been downvoted to obilvion, but somehow it found itself at the top of our sub, making us all look crazy. People should investigate this, but not the way those people did. It was reckless, irresponsible and borderline illegal and we all got duped into promoting it to the top of the sub. I just felt that it would be better if people posted things like that elsewhere and then link it rather than posting it here directly. That was enough for some to think that I was somehow censoring that information. No I just asked that people post it elsewhere for the integrity of our sub. After <a href="/r/PizzaGate">/r/PizzaGate</a> was banned we all saw what can happen. To avoid something like that here, we need to redirect that subject to a place where there is a degree of seperation from us or a similar fate may befall us.</p>

<p>Just FYI, it&#39;s all conjecture and reeks of 4chan trolling/manic-delusion.

    <div class="md"><p>I agree that the alt-right jumped on this particular theory because it helped to de-legitimize the left and in D.C. this kind of thing is great for the opposition to sling around as a weapon. I know it&#39;s been sensationalized quite a bit (if it&#39;s true, it doesn&#39;t need to be sensationalized, it&#39;s already insane enough). There is quite a bit of conjecture, but that doesn&#39;t make a lot of inconvenient facts go away. I  need to watch some pizzagate debunking videos to really get info from all sides to make an informed decision. I will admit that I am being a lazy researcher with this subject because of kids and time constraints.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There is no way they would get away with banning r/conspiracy.  The users of reddit would not allow it. You seen what happened when they tried to ban subs lIke r/fatpeoplehate. There was a huge uproar and the ceo had to step down. I am extremely surprised something didn&#39;t go down after r/pizzagate was taken down. I think it&#39;s because it was a fairly new sub and topic. R/conspiracy has been around for a long time. And for alot of people it&#39;s the one of the only subs they visit. Taking out r/conspiracy would be the end of reddit as we know it. Personally I think reddit has proven more than once that is suppresses free speech and we should boycott it. Nevertheless people still congregate here and it is still a great place to get breaking information </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Weren&#39;t you #2 on the list of mods?<br/>
Many don&#39;t know this but the moderator list is a hierarchy.  Those mods that are lower on the list can&#39;t remove mods that are higher on the list.  No matter what.  They don&#39;t have the rights to do it.</p>

<p>Don&#39;t believe me?  Well here&#39;s the quote from <a href="https://www.reddit.com/wiki/moderation">wiki</a> at <a href="/r/modhelp">/r/modhelp</a>  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Can I be removed as a moderator of my subreddit?</p>

<p>Any mod above you on the moderator list can remove you at any time. If your account is inactive on reddit for 60 days or longer any mods below you in seniority can use <a href="/r/redditrequest">/r/redditrequest</a> to have you removed or if you are the only moderator any user can use <a href="/r/redditrequest">/r/redditrequest</a> to take over your subreddit. Please see the rules in <a href="/r/redditrequest">/r/redditrequest</a> for details.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It&#39;s further clarified in another section of that wiki also:  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Can other moderators remove me as a moderator?</p>

<p>Any moderator appointed after you cannot remove you, only moderators above you that have &#39;full permissions&#39; can. They can however override your bans and post removals.
The chronological order of appointment is shown vertically in the list of moderators. A moderator that is listed below you cannot remove you.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Therefore the reports about him/her being voted out don&#39;t hold water.  Now if he/she was lower on the list then yeah, he/she could have been removed.</p>

<p>The other thing is, quitting in protest is silly because once you&#39;re out, you&#39;re out.  Stay and fight for what is right regardless of how difficult the fight is.  If the sub was good enough to fight for, you should have stayed.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes it is a hierarchy. This is why we need a strong top mod that will keep in close contact and not go MIA for long periods of time. I was #3 for a long while (just below donbueno and illuminatedwax). A few years back donbueno removed all of the mods below him because we did something that pissed him off, and I think it was the admins who stepped in and gave us a handler to make sure we played nice for a while. When we were re-added the mod order got shuffled, and I ended up like 4 or 5 on the list, so there were like 2 or 3 mods that could have removed me if they wanted to. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>donbueno said illuminatedwax was the real culprit, after he purged the mods and they all got added back. Is wax a top-level admin account?</p>

<p>I say you just stick around and become a regular contributor here. I never really saw you participate before which is probably why a lot of people are questioning this maneuver, but more can be done from the sidelines than from the top anyway. The <em>true</em> hierarchy is horizontal not vertical. :)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have never been pro-censorship. My record on that speaks for itself. I have been here for about 5 years as a mod now, and I wrote the original sidebar mission (with help from the other mods at the time.) I believe very much that this is a free speech zone. I&#39;ve never removed content that wasn&#39;t very much over the line (the rules listed in the sidebar). I have worked very hard to maintain this sub under those conditions. About 3 years ago I had my first child and I have taken a lot of time off from day to day moderation of this sub. I still checked in quite often and made sure most of the mods were on the up and up. But something bothered me about the things I have been seeing lately, and the mod team being divided about these issues really does no one any good. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Your idea of letting the vote decide who&#39;s right is farcical without telling us specifically what you think should be moderated or banned. You disagree with other moderators, so what?--tell us what that disagreement is then! There is no right or wrong, true/false, or informed vote on something unless you make a specific claim. Make your claim (something capable of being true or false) and then ask for a vote on it. But simply coming on a &quot;conspiracy&quot; subreddit and assuming that upvotes to your tantalizingly vague post proves some kind of point that the rest of us don&#39;t even know is completely childish. I for one will be happy to be rid of you unless you bother to state a thesis.</p>

They have been infiltrated by people who are shit posting to make the rest of the forums look crazy. It&#39;s working. Most replies are brief obnoxious ones and there is no longer any meaningful discourse. I&#39;m over it. I don&#39;t care anymore. I&#39;m no investigator but I do enjoy reading material on intriguing subjects. I shall reserve my precious time for books now.

    <div class="md"><p>the floodgates in r/conspiracy were opened on campaign time because people felt there was no freedom of expression in some of the main political subs. 
That said, we passed that, the &quot;underdogs&quot; won, for now, so it&#39;s time to go back to focus on conspiracies.
I&#39;m one of those that admited I was coming to r/conspiracy for news, because I felt it was sacred ground for some info to flow.</p>

<p>Maybe there should be a new sub with conspiracies in mind for all the &quot;BREAKING&quot; and all the other shitposting, which it might be interesting and valid, but it definitely clogs this sub and diminishes its capacity to discuss and document about conspiracies with time and reading. Not surfing on &quot;news&quot;.</p>

<p>Sorry to heat it came to this for you 9000sins.
Good luck with your projects!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m fairly new to this sub, but I see what your talking about. All of a sudden the quality of posts just dropped like a ton of bricks in the ocean. And only garbage threads are making it to the top. I also notice weird things with the upvote counter on threads where they jump up votes then get knocked down by either 2, 5, or 10 votes the next second. </p>

<p>Just weird how this was actually a good source for investigation purposes and now you have to check at least 5 pages back to make sure you didn&#39;t actually miss a good post. And then that good post dies  because it&#39;s constantly pushed to the bottom to never be seen.</p>

<p>So in conclusion I see it all man, who would of thought it would get this far SO QUICK! Goodbye either way I hardly knew ye. But major props for wanting to get out there and ACTUALLY do something about it :).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Okay. For a very long time, we the mods of <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> chose not to censor content of any kind unless it explicitly broke one of the few rules listed on the sidebar. I have not removed any content about PizzaGate, nor do I have a problem with people researching it or posting findings here. I simply felt that with the recent closing of <a href="/r/pizzagate">/r/pizzagate</a> we have had a huge rush of users here that used to post that stuff there, but now they do it here instead because of the no moderation policy. My concern is mainly that if those people got their sub shut down by posting only about this subject, and then when it got shut down they all came here and continued business as usual, what does that say about our chances of survival in this space? All I have asked people to do is post pizzagate related materials to voat.co and link it here. Nothing less, nothing more.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What pile of shit. Mods of <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> have been deleting posts and comments left and right if they don&#39;t support the establishment&#39;s preferred narrative, and I happen to know because I&#39;ve had mine deleted numerous times recently.</p>

<p><a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> has been hard at work shilling for the establishment and unless one falls for the narrative by worshiping Trump, they get quickly silenced.</p>

<p>That being said - why not tell the truth? Have you been sacrificed and chosen to take the hit so the establishment can continue manipulating the narrative on <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> because the readers have become aware of the rhetoric on the sub being controlled to promote &quot;Trump the Savior&quot; agenda? The aware among us know that Hillary was sacrificed in the same fashion - in order to hoodwink the sheeple into worshiping Trump as God.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I am generally in favor of this style of moderation. In this particular case it&#39;s not that I don&#39;t believe it. I believe 1000000% that pizzagate is fucking real. I want those involved to face serious consequences. This video was not about truth. This should have been downvoted to obilvion, but somehow it found itself at the top of our sub, making us all look crazy. People should investigate this, but not the way those people did. It was reckless, irresponsible and borderline illegal and we all got duped into promoting it to the top of the sub. I just felt that it would be better if people posted things like that elsewhere and then link it rather than posting it here directly. That was enough for some to think that I was somehow censoring that information. No I just asked that people post it elsewhere for the integrity of our sub. After <a href="/r/PizzaGate">/r/PizzaGate</a> was banned we all saw what can happen. To avoid something like that here, we need to redirect that subject to a place where there is a degree of seperation from us or a similar fate may befall us.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;ve probably already been asked this, so if you have, feel free to copy paste or link your answer.</p>

<p>I understand your concern about Pizzagate here. I personally think there&#39;s a lot of truth to it, but I also worry that this sub could be removed or quarantined if we aren&#39;t very careful about personal information.</p>

<p>You wanting to lower the amount of pizzagate stuff makes sense and isn&#39;t suspicious. </p>

<p>BUT - I 100% understand why people are suspicious and upset about you going to the admins about removing said inactive mod.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know if you&#39;re telling the truth or not, but some of your answers seem really off to me and don&#39;t make much sense.</p>

<p>Even if you thought you were doing a favor and everyone would be OK with what you did, why wouldn&#39;t you even discuss it with your fellow mods?</p>

<p>Did you at least link them to your request or did the others find out on their own?</p>

<p>Also, considering the fact that we&#39;ve witnessed actual take overs on other subs, if another mod had done the same thing and didn&#39;t tell anyone, wouldn&#39;t <em>you</em> find that suspicious? Especially considering the topic of this subreddit?</p>

Taking shots of Everclear in front of your child wouldn&#39;t warrant an investigation but if you vape cannabis then you&#39;re the most irresponsible parent ever.

    <div class="md"><p>I tended to let some of the crazier stuff go, like UFO, Bigfoot, flat earth, hollow earth, etc. I know maybe it doesn&#39;t fit into those categories but I tend to like the sub to have a little more variety than just political conspiracy all day every day. Don&#39;t get me wrong, it&#39;s the biggest issue we face as humanity right now. But I have always believed that <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> was like an umbrella sub that covers all of these subjects and doesn&#39;t leave anything out. Asserting fact in a lot of those subjects is damn near impossible as there are almost no established facts to go on. This made moderating that stuff pretty easy because I mostly just left it alone. It never really gets that much attention anyways. But when you have misleading political conspiracy stories they somehow always rise to the top. </p>
