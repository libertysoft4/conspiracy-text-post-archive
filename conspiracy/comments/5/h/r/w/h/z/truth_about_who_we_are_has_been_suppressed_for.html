        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>In times like these it&#39;s important to know who and what we truly are so we have a grounding point. These viewpoints aren&#39;t known or shared by many people on earth but will be soon because of an awakening of who we are going on. </p>

<p>Ever since December of 2012 (what was supposed to be the &quot;end times&quot; but was really us stepping into a new age of spiritual advancement)</p>

<p>We are all one. We come from source energy. We are billions of versions of God experiencing himself through ourselves. We are all equals, no one is better than anyone. No one truly dies, we are eternal spirits of consciousness that can&#39;t be destroyed. Consciousness is energy. Energy can&#39;t be destroyed. We are spiritual beings having a physical experience. School is a place of learning for souls. Advanced alien life exists. It&#39;s possible to channel alien consciousness.</p>

<p>We, aliens, and the creator, as well as animals, plants, and every living organism are all one. No one is truly separate; we are all connected, even to alien species. The human body has 7 chakra points of energy through the body. We are truly powerful beings that can shape our own destiny and our own realities through the use of free will and law of attraction.</p>

<p>This is just some of the information suppressed not only by the Vatican but by most governments all over the world.</p>

<p>Humanity is undergoing a spiritual awakening currently on a global scale and is the reason for most conflict and negativity currently. </p>

<p>Alien disclosure will unite us as one and is one of the reasons why alien disclosure has been kept a secret. The evil dark people that were once controlling this world do not want us United.</p>

<p>It is too late. The momentum of an awakening of consciousness is sweeping through mankind and negative evil self serving people will no longer hold reign of this planet.</p>

<p>The people of earth are reclaiming their power and their home of Mother Earth and are going to live in harmony with Mother Earth once again. This is probably not new information to most of you but it&#39;s good to be refreshed. I love you guys. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is every thought I&#39;ve been going through once I turned to the other side recently. The world is more interesting to me than ever. I feel like I&#39;m living for the first time. </p>

<p>I&#39;ve been non religious most of my life but believed in the possibility of a higher power, just unaware of what it could be. Mostly flip flop with higher power or we just get buried and that&#39;s it. </p>

<p>I never, ever, thought in my life I would become the person I transitioned into these past few months. Everything in my life lead up to the moment where I believe in everything you talked about. It got weird. I&#39;ve always researched history because I always felt like I really didn&#39;t know our true history since school was a pack of lies. Then I started researching energies and meanings and origins behind everything. My favorite colors, animals, numbers, zodiac all completely are spot on for who I am. Even my friends and coworkers all have meaning to why they are in my life. </p>

<p>Thanks for this. I have been getting too distracted lately. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks for the reply. And you are right man! Everything you have done has led you to this point. Everything happens for a reason and there are no coincidences. Small things happen to us here and there but can lead us to something great. I pretty much started off the same way. Prodding into various things until I started connecting all the dots between all this material. It&#39;s a truly eye opening experience and really opens you up to that feeling of peacefulness and oneness.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have it on good faith and authority that the planet is moving into a higher &quot;density.&quot; The energies right now are fucking ridiculous. Even my [more grounded, blue pill] friends are feeling it. And I know what I&#39;m experiencing firsthand - life-changing thoughtforms, the encroaching Ubermensch. Almost too much for me if I&#39;m not diligent in regulating my cognitive behavior.</p>

<p>Mother Earth is activating an immune system of sorts to combat the demonic incursion she has endured for millennia. Stay strong and diligent. There is FAR more to this reality than we are being told or taught. This is a mis-en-scene of good and evil, and the darkness is on its heels right now. The Shadow Cabal is finished. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>YES! IT IS HAPPENING. </p>

<p>I&#39;d also like to suggest to my brothers and sisters that, being energy, our state of being is a frequency. Inner frequencies are projected outwards to the world and are subconsciously picked up by others. Picture a radio antenna shooting out a song to the world. Thus, by understanding the truth (we are all pure consciousness, which is everyones&#39; God), we are naturally and effortlessly projecting the truth outwards to the world, which literally gets picked up by other individual consciousnesses. At this time, the truth will spread like wild fire.</p>

<p>As OP mentioned, a negative energy has enslaved us for an unfathomably long time but the elite have provided us all with a Dark Night from which we are all preparing to escape. How? Dismissing ego and returning back to our true, uninfluenced state of perfect love/light.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Just remember when taking in this information to refrain from accepting more hierarchical structures. I have noticed that the whole ascension agenda good vs evil (Not to be confused with awakening which is empowering you come to your own conclusions without an authority structure) trys to wrap people up into a new false system of spiritual guidance that isn&#39;t really beneficial to a souls well being, but actual serves these so called masters.</p>

<p>If you find people are calling themselves masters, or spiritual light workers its probably another system of control.</p>

<p>I do agree you need to be careful with charlatans. I always advocate for everyone to do their own research, come to their own opinions, and to not let anyone shape their reality for them.</p>

<p>It&#39;s important with this kind of information to let people come to their own conclusions and to not force anything through or try to be a gate keeper and promise only all information can come through you.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I respect your opinion and agree with most of your post, except that we are &quot;one&quot; with aliens, animals, plants etc. I believe humans are a separate and distinct species created in the image of God. The Bible has prophesied what is happening now for many ages. </p>

<p>There is a great spiritual battle being waged between God and his angels and Satan and his demons for our souls. Jesus came to earth to provide the pathway back to heaven, by being offered as the sacrificial Lamb to cleanse away all of mankind&#39;s sins, past present and future. The devil knows his days are coming to an end soon and is working overtime to take as many of us down with him as he can.  God loves us immensely and wants us back from the grips of the devil. The shadow cabal are the enemy&#39;s agents brainwashing and oppressing us to lead us into darkness. This is the ultimate conspiracy.  We must repent and pray for God&#39;s help in this fight. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks for the reply and I hope I don&#39;t ruffle your feathers with my opinion I&#39;m about to give but I feel it&#39;s relevant to what you said.</p>

<p>Hell doesn&#39;t exist, and neither does Satan (source: conversations with God, book 1, 2, &amp; 3) but evil and negativity are real things and the polar opposite of what we truly are which is love, light, and joy &amp; kindness.</p>

<p>Churches have used religions as a means of control with fear thrown in to get you to come back. While I love the idea of community and coming together at a church and listening to positive things I&#39;m against the notion of fearing God and fearing that you will go to hell.</p>

<p>Neither hell nor Satan exist but like I said evil and the opposite of love exist because we live in a dual spectrum world to help us choose what we truly want in life because if everything was only &quot;all good&quot; all the time, we would not learn anything. By having evil and love together in the same world gives us a choice as a soul to choose what we want to resonate with.</p>

<p>I feel it&#39;s time religion is left in the past where it belongs and I believe we as a species should move forward to spiritual truths that will unite us and bring us together as one as we truly are.</p>

<p>Now, there are negatively aligned entities that only focus on service to self (greed, and everything opposite of service to others)</p>

<p>Until recently they maintained power over humans for A LONG ASS TIME, and are now losing their power because of this spiritual revolution taking place ever since we entered a new age of spiritual empowerment (December 2012)</p>

<p>Love and light is making its way to the main stream. Humanity has gone SO FAR INTO THE DARKNESS that we are snapping back into the light like a rubber band held back too far.</p>

<p>We are getting launched into a new way of living. A new way of consciousness, a new meaning of life.</p>

<p>Negative oriented souls will no longer hold the reigns of this earth and it is now time for humans to come together and express our desire to advance and evolve as a spiritually enlightened species.</p>

<p>These next few years will be trying times as the dark negative cabal tries their hardest to grasp onto the power they once held. They won&#39;t be able to. It&#39;s falling around them.</p>

<p>We are cleansing ourselves as a whole. That&#39;s why there&#39;s so much negativity happening currently. As each day passes we become closer and closer to not only full disclosure of advanced alien intelligence but come closer to spiritual truth of who and what we truly are and where we came from.</p>

<p>Thanks for your reply man and I hope I didn&#39;t upset you.</p>

Sounds very similar to a &quot;hidden hand&quot; interview I read recently ;) touching on 2012 as an awakening (or graduation) of our spirit. And that day was also a catalyst of some sort. 
This is a new viewpoint for me, and am anxious to learn more!</p>

<p>Lol kidding!</p>

<p>We are coming full circle. The Library of Alexandria was destroyed for this reason. It held just about all records of our past, likely documenting many exo-people and breakaway human groups. If the ultra elite at the time wanted to extend their evil bloodline, they could destroy that library. However they also knew that eventually positive consciousness en masse is needed to truly evolve to higher densities, like 3 - 4 and to 5.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No. It&#39;s because I used to be able to find intelligent discussions and relevant information on this sub. Now, most of what I find is tabloid bullshit, and now apparently pseudoscience/new-age is acceptable here. I&#39;m close to un-subbing--not that it matters to anyone other than myself.</p>

<p>Btw, this &quot;information&quot; isn&#39;t esoteric. It&#39;s just a hodgepodge of cool-sounding ideas pulled from different spiritual belief systems. But, who knows? I could be wrong and fail to ascend to the 4th density or whatever.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Actually there is information out there that Tim Leary worked for the cultural engineers to bring about the psychedelic movement. Another system of control with provocateurs to continue to control perception and keep that generation from discovering the truth. That&#39;s what happens to each generation. You will find that all of these movements have a centralized control strcutures in place to limit the scope of humanity.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I respect your viewpoints but I don&#39;t consider this information a hodgepodge of different religions and new age &quot;theories&quot;</p>

<p>These are documented facts that have been repeatedly brought about through different mediums for thousands of years.</p>

<p>Even music, passionate writing or songs, and art and other things in a sense are channeled from the divine essence of what we are all made of.</p>

<p>You can deny and label this all you want and I respect that as everyone has free will but I respectfully disagree with the idea that this is new age Bologna. </p>

<p>A lot of these principles can even be explained in modern science such as string theory and other quantum concepts that science is beginning to unravel and understand.</p>

<p>Thanks for the reply and I wish you the best</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah I think you are trying to stretch the truth. I wouldn&#39;t call them facts, since they can&#39;t be verified empirically. When you are dealing with information that is being passed extra sensory I&#39;d be very skeptical about taking it in as complete truth. Too many variables that can cause error.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I would not state these things without first hand knowledge. I hate spreading false information. And these facts theories and ideas have intrigued me for years but I finally understand it enough to where I can reduce it down to something simple to help people understand.</p>

<p>I would not have been able to type this up years or even months ago. I&#39;ve done a lot of research on these things to help me understand what it means. Again I am a huge advocate for only stating truth and facts. I would hate to mis lead anyone.</p>

<p>I understand your concern.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Humbly speaking, you approach concerns me. If you have first hand knowedge about this information you should be extra careful not to imply any essence of fact by your own knowledge in an attempt to create anchors of authority since nobody will be able to confirm it.</p>

<p>To me that&#39;s usually a sign that there is some ego involved. There is a Huge movment to deceive people durring this transition to get people to subscribe to new systems of control. The alien abduction theory I consider to be one of them along with the false light vs dark battle being part of the demiurge.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree and understand what you mean. I&#39;ve always tried to limit my own ego and there is such a thing as spiritual ego. I&#39;ve always tried to suppress my own and I will admit it is very easy to fill your ego in regards to spiritual insight.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t try to anchor facts in a way that says it&#39;s only this or that way but I am insistent on people doing their own research and their own conclusions.</p>

<p>I merely just wanted to present these facts in a way that is easy for people to understand.</p>

<p>I would never want to lead someone astray or maintain power or control over anyone... Control and power are the last things I want or need I just merely want to help people wake up.</p>
