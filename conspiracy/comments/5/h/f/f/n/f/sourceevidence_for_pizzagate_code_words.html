    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not saying you or anyone is wrong.  But it seems to me that in years of law enforcement investigation, journalism investigation and psychological study of pedophiles, there would just have to be evidence here in the real world inside the pages of books, official documents, online discussion.  Something at all aside form personally going to the dark web yourself to have a look.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That would be great.  If people really want to call themselves part of a &quot;citizens investigation&quot; they need to hold themselves to the absolute highest ethical level of standard and demand proof and evidence for everything they see and read regarding this.

<p>Says you, but I still see no proof.</p>

<p>People were saying this is an FBI list of code words. That is obviously not true. As far as verification of the code words, there isn&#39;t any verification...and unless you&#39;re looking at child porn yourself, I doubt you have any idea what&#39;s on the dark web.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The FBI very well may know of code words used by pedophiles and have them classified.  But that doesn&#39;t help us here any because we don&#39;t know them.  The next best thing to official documents would be demonstrations of provable real world use.  Also it would be helpful to see any published articles and/or books about pedophilia that state these codewords.  You would think that this evidence would be easily presentable if it were true.  But again, I&#39;m not saying anyone is wrong.  But I cannot believe anything without evidence.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re absolutely right. I only harp on the FBI list because that was what people were saying for the longest time and many still believe it.

    <div class="md"><p>I think that it&#39;s very easy to make the mistake of accepting unproved facts because there are a high number of very unusual things about all of this.  The Spirit Cooking emails, the Jeffrey Epstein connection, the strange deaths surrounding the Clinton Foundation, the large amount of highly bizarre artwork, the number of Podesta emails that do seem to be speaking in code, the logos that do seem to coincide with FBI pedophile symbols, etc.  There is a lot of strange stuff that begins to paint a picture.  And people want to do their part to expose it and sometimes fall for unproven points along the way.  It happens but it should be diligently fought against.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The thing about all those unusual things is they are not unusual to me. I see logical explanations for pretty much everything you listed.</p>

<p>Two things I do want to comment on are:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Jeffrey Epstein - this is disturbing, but not so unusual considering Epstein apparently knows everybody. Epstein is certainly well-connected to the Clintons (his girlfriend who took sexy photos of underage girls was at Chelsea&#39;s wedding after Epstein got busted and we all know Clinton flew Lolita Express many times), but that doesn&#39;t mean anyone who knows the Clintons is guilty. Especially pizza &quot;code words&quot; at a pizza shop. Like Alex Jones said, &quot;pizza is a super-common word!&quot; and &quot;[James Alefanti] might well be innocent for all we know!&quot;</p></li>
<li><p>strange deaths surrounding Clinton Foundation - yes, definitely...so why are we getting distracted with Comet Ping Pong? Clintons are the ones who needs to be investigated. There is a lot more substantial evidence about them in all the information we have up to this point than anything about Comet Ping Pong.</p></li>

<p>But, now I imagine you have to look harder because any searches should turn up &quot;pizzagate&quot; information, which proves nothing about pizzagate.  </p>

<p>Pete Townsend got caught doing &quot;research&quot;, so the dark web is a bad idea.  LOL.  </p>

<p>It is better to ask a legitimate source at this point, but I do not know who.  I suggested before to ask law enforcement, but that might be a bad idea now that I think about it.  They will be suspicious of you.  Maybe ask a lawyer that specializes in these cases, especially computer related.  He or she should be familiar with the terminology used, and lawyers are bound by attorney-client privilege.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well a real true serious investigator or journalist could simply contact experts on pedophilia.  Whether they are a current or retired FBI agent.  A journalist or psychologist who studies pedophilia.  Or perhaps a private investigator who has experience in studying the field.  Or hell, even someone who is an actual pedophile.  There&#39;s got to be a reformed pedophile who could answer these questions.</p>

There is so much more in the Podesta emails to investigate and there are definitely pedophile ties to the Clintons and pay to play and the Clinton Foundation should be invetsigated...but they won&#39;t be because a bunch of fools fell for pizzagate instead.</p>

<p>This is the same thing that happened with the 9/11 Investigation. A bunch of kooks came up with really absurd claims not based in reality and made the whole truther movement look nuts when it counted. After the judgement was made by the general population, it didn&#39;t matter anymore that the majority thinks something is fishy with 9/11; it was cemented in public opinion. The same thing is going to happen with the Podesta emails. People are going to say condescendingly: &quot;oh, you&#39;re a pizzagater?&quot; without any clue what all is in the Wikiemail dump.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sorry, nope.  Why wouldn&#39;t any law enforcement agency, anywhere in the world produce this information as a way for parents and concerned individuals to beware of these things?  It&#39;s false on its face.  There would be alerts from police in France, or their FBI equivalent.  Maybe a document from police in Japan, or any western european country if this were indeed some well-known pedo language.  This FBI document was produced supposedly in 2007, so where is any other document, from anywhere in the whole world, and from a reliable source like law enforcement in the last 10 solid years?  Or do law enforcement agencies now just allow all of this to go on without ever alerting the public?  This is supposed to be a world-wide phenomenon, not just something on the east coast of the USA. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I understand, same here.</p>

<p>I find this to be an honest assumption though:  Whic is more likely, that a huge elite satanic child abduction ring exists and is being run out of a pizza restaurant, or since Assange is missing, and these documents are not verifiable (documents that hinge on the whole thing being legit) this is all a ruse that blew up in order to hide the proven corruption of the Clinton foundation and the complicity of many Clinton insiders?  The public has a short attention span.  Just watch as this scandal fizzles and the Clinton&#39;s are never charged with anything.  </p>

<p>I personally think there is a lot more validity in the latter.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>When I first heard of this, I thought it was crazy and people were making shit up.  Then someone posted a link to Conspiracy of Silence on youtube.  That was an eye opener.  There are also other documentary videos on youtube about this issue (see below).  So, I think it is likely that children are being abducted by powerful people and used for sex.  I see the same patterns and behaviors being described in these videos.  </p>

<p>You are right, the public does have a short attention span, but we can communicate with each other easily.  This does not have to die if we keep pushing for change.  Soon, Trump will be in the White House and the Republicans will have both houses of Congress. The Democrats will not be able to interfere with the investigation.  If the Republicans cover this up, then we will know that they are also involved.  </p>

<p>I provide this video because they are more open about what they do even though it is illegal.  You can get some insight into how they keep things going without police interference.  You can also get some insight into how they find boys.  For example, one man operates a kite shop because he knows that young boys love to fly kites.  That way, he does not have to go searching for young boys.  They come to him...  Young boys in American love pizza and ping pong, but it would be inappropriate for me to jump to any conclusions, so I won&#39;t.   </p>

<p>There&#39;s enough real stuff without these crazy panics that keep on happening. In the UK we had this happen too many times, crazed tabloid outrage that led to things like a paediatrician being abused (really). But that&#39;s tabloids, they like angrying people up to sell papers.</p>

<p>Actually this does make me wonder about all the sites and YouTube channels &#39;reporting&#39; on this. Some frequently talk up how they&#39;re in danger and fake threatening emails, and they&#39;re getting money for all this.

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s not 800,000, you&#39;re getting confused by how they calculate these things. When you see a shocking looking statistic it only takes a quick search to check it out. I mean that would be greater 10% of all children going missing annually.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Just 115 of the 797,500 children were subject to what Finkelhor and his co-authors define as a &quot;stereotypical&quot; kidnapping - that is, they were abducted by a stranger and detained overnight, perhaps permanently, or taken at least 50 miles away.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And those aren&#39;t all permanently missing, and old numbers when this has been on the decline.</p>

<p>The way the stats are reported in the UK is the same, so I can&#39;t be bothered to dig through and find the real total (and I like to be up to date). But some old reports suggest that the UK equivalent to the that 115 for the US is 20~.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree the truth will eventually come out.  Advancing false information does likely slow it down though.  Even if 3/4 of an investigation&#39;s evidence is absolutely true, the mainstream will cherrypick the 1/4 of poorly researched evidence to discredit you.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The thing about all those unusual things is they are not unusual to me. I see logical explanations for pretty much everything you listed.</p>

<p>Two things I do want to comment on are:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Jeffrey Epstein - this is disturbing, but not so unusual considering Epstein apparently knows everybody. Epstein is certainly well-connected to the Clintons (his girlfriend who took sexy photos of underage girls was at Chelsea&#39;s wedding after Epstein got busted and we all know Clinton flew Lolita Express many times), but that doesn&#39;t mean anyone who knows the Clintons is guilty. Especially pizza &quot;code words&quot; at a pizza shop. Like Alex Jones said, &quot;pizza is a super-common word!&quot; and &quot;[James Alefanti] might well be innocent for all we know!&quot;</p></li>
<li><p>strange deaths surrounding Clinton Foundation - yes, definitely...so why are we getting distracted with Comet Ping Pong? Clintons are the ones who needs to be investigated. There is a lot more substantial evidence about them in all the information we have up to this point than anything about Comet Ping Pong.</p></li>
</ul>
