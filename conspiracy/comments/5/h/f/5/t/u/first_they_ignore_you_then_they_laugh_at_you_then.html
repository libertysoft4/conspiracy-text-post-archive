        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>These wise words resonate as truth, especially today. The mainstream media has ignored us and that failed. They laughed at us and that failed. Now they are forced to fight us, intellectually, and they will fail once again. I would just like to congratulate all of the people working tirelessly to expose evil in high places for our inevitable victory. It has been and will continue to be a strenuous information battle. The ultimate evil, the one&#39;s who lust for power and control. Their time is running out. They are attempting to take the whole of human consciousness for themselves. It will fail as well. This is because Love and Truth from our source is the One and only TRUTH. Stay strong and remember that the MSM is in its death throes. Keep spreading love, life, light and Truth. </p>

<p>EDIT: Another user pointed out that this is a common misattributed quote to Ghandi. There is not much evidence to show whether he said this or not yet it is very similar to another quote by the trade unionist Nicholas Klein gave in a 1918 address to the Amalgamated Clothing Workers of America in Baltimore, &quot;First they ignore you. Then they ridicule you. And then they attack you and want to burn you. And then they build monuments to you. And that, is what is going to happen to the Amalgamated Clothing Workers of America.&quot; Either way it is an inspirational quote and I&#39;m sure Ghandi would have loved it too. Thank you to the user who pointed this out.</p>

<p>Just kidding the sun actually does change sizes drastically in the sky because it&#39;s going away and coming back it spins around the north pole. We&#39;re not spinning around millions of kilometers away in space.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What makes you think the earth is flat? I&#39;ve never seen the globe earth with my own eyes only pictures, and as a natural skeptic I know I can&#39;t trust gov pictures. In other words I have no idea either way. I&#39;ll tell ya one thing it sure does look and feel flat and still from my perspective but what do I know lol. One thing I haven&#39;t heard flat earth advocates explain is a crescent moon. Offical explanation of course is it&#39;s the shadow of the globe earth cast by the sun. Any explanation?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah I had heard that all their photos are admittedly CGI and it doesn&#39;t surprised me. What I find interesting is that all the photos show a perfect sphere, yet they turn around and say that Earth is more pear shaped when debating with flat earth advocates. About the moon, I have seen the experiment that shows things are cooler under direct moonlight at night which is interesting. But if the moon is giving off its own light how come the cycle it goes through forms a crescent moon? What I mean is that it seems like an odd shape to randomly create that can be explained away by the shadow of the globe earth being projected on it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Good question research that yourself but keep an open mind. There is an easily explainable reason. Maybe the sunlight doesn&#39;t line up properly. I can add that the moon goes through cycles, new moon to new moon is 29.5 days. Watch the sky, it&#39;s an elaborate lie. :)</p>
