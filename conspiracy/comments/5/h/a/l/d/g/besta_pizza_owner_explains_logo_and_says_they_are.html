        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>From their google reviews: &quot;Besta Pizza is a family owned and operated since August 1992. It was bought by the family from John Umble, it was named then Pizza Movers. We joined Pizza Boli&#39;s franchise a year later till early 2000. We had our differences with Pizza Boli&#39;s organization and parted ways around 2001 after a court battle in DC. (Pizza Boli&#39;s vs HIZ Inc.) Unfortunately we lost the case and with it, we lost the name and our phone numbers. We had to work hard to come up with a new name and logo and phone number. a friend recommended a friend , who turned around and recommended another friend to design a logo and the new name. We did that in two days and started printing our flyers under the new name and logo since. Lately we were accused of adopting that vulgar symbol and being associated with Comet pizza (Actually, they claimed that the owner of Comet Pizza also own Besta Pizza, Which is far from the truth), of running a sex-trafficking ring. We existed and been in business long before Comet became a neighbor. Actually, the land lord had to ask us for permission to allow Comet&#39;s owner to lease that space. We respect everybody&#39;s way of life, but at the same time we expect any person to verify their source of information before accusing innocent people of such a terrible behavior and in turn ruin their business. As soon as we were aware of the Logo&#39;s meanings, we immediately changed it. We apologize for any misunderstanding. Please feel free to contact us if you still need more verification or answers to your questions. It will take us a little time to update our signs due to tight cash flow situation. Thank you all for understanding. Regards, Besta Pizza&quot;</p>

<p>EDIT: I&#39;m not sure how/if you can link reviews from google </p>

    <div class="md"><p>My gut tells me the besta pizza guys aren&#39;t involved. The biggest tie, other than proximity was that Andrew kline was the registered officer, but he is for 200 or more restaurants. We&#39;ve debunked that it&#39;s the DOJ guy, and it&#39;s a normal hospitality/restaurant activity to have a registrar as DC requires a lawyer to handle filings. </p>

<p>Once you debunk that, and look at the fact that besta has been around for 25 or so years, I think it could be a coincidence the logo is similar to known pedo stuff, especially since they&#39;ve used that logo for 10 plus years.</p>

<p>How did you decide on the name Besta Pizza again? </p>

<p>We&#39;ll need the name of the man who designed your original logo. He needs to be questioned as it appears he is involved in pedophilia. Do you plan on suing him for damages? </p>

<p>Do you acknowledge the fact that you have a basement? Would you allow live feed video of your restaurant and the basement? </p>
