    <div class="md"><p>Thank you, I read it and the article does make a lot of sense. From the whole fueling gun sales through the 2nd amendment debate, when the gov&#39;t should not be a threat to its citizens along with homeland security not existing 14 years ago, is a way to use tax payers money for military purchases and is not needed, to Chomsky and others being gatekeepers. I am curious though who this guy is? I mean he is an artist his webpage looks like old html and he just seems like an interesting figure or mysterious. But I haven&#39;t looked into it.

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t know Miles personally, though I have corresponded with him quite a bit. I also contributed two papers to his website, one exposing <a href="http://mileswmathis.com/fakir.pdf">Gandhi</a> as controlled opposition and one showing that <a href="http://mileswmathis.com/dreyfus.pdf">the Dreyfus Affair was a hoax.</a> </p>

<p>He has a small annual conference where a handful of people spend a week with him talking about science and conspiracy. I blog occasionally over at <a href="http://pieceofmindful.com">PieceOfMindful,</a> and the guy who started that blog, Mark Tokarski, went to this year&#39;s conference and attests to his authenticity, as does another guy (&quot;Brandon&quot;) who who also went to the conference and now comments at our blog. I&#39;ve never personally met either of those two guys, so at the end of the day I don&#39;t really have anything to go on beyond strangers&#39; testimonials and my own instinct. </p>

<p>Some people accuse him of being disinfo or whatever, but I disagree. Of course I could be wrong. I don&#39;t think he&#39;s 100% right about everything, but I don&#39;t think he&#39;s intentionally trying to mislead. And even if he is disinfo, his work has opened up my eyes and my mind to a lot of things that I think are true. If nothing else, he helped me recognize disinformation and skip past a lot of blind alleys and wrong turns in the world of conspiracy. </p>

<p>You can read his bio on his website: <a href="http://mileswmathis.com/bio.html">http://mileswmathis.com/bio.html</a> </p>

<p>As for his conspiracy research, I recommend going to <a href="http://mileswmathis.com/updates.html">this page</a> and going down to 2013 and his paper on Theosophy and the Beat Generation. Work your way forward from there (including my papers), because he is discovering things as he goes along and it&#39;s helpful to read them in order (you can skip the review of the Painted word). You will have to decide for yourself if you think he&#39;s disinfo. </p>

<p>BTW, before he really waded into the conspiracy world, he spent over a decade rebuilding and rethinking physics from the ground up. His <a href="http://milesmathis.com/">physics work</a> is remarkable and <a href="http://milesmathis.com/rainbow2.pdf">surprisingly accessible.</a> I think he&#39;s a genius, and I don&#39;t use that term lightly. He also is/was an artist and art critic (or counter-critic). </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hey, I just peeked into your comment history and notice you mentioned false flags a fair amount. Here is what I&#39;ve learned, and if you examine the evidence (as you should), you might reach the same conclusion:</p>

<p>They always give us (at least) two versions of events: One is the official mainstream narrative. Take San Bernardino for example. The mainstream narrative is it&#39;s the Muslim couple. </p>

<p>The other is what I would call the &#39;mainstream&#39; conspiracy narrative. In the case of SB, it&#39;s that there were 3 white gunmen who &#39;really did it.&#39; </p>

<p>But in my experience the truth is usually that these events are hoaxed, and they give us false leads to keep us off the scent of the hoax. I think it helps them sell the illusion that we have a free press or something. So yes, what I&#39;m telling you is that SB, Orlando, Aurora, Paris, Brussels, Dallas, etc. were all hoaxed (just like Sandy Hook and Boston, which even the mainstream conspiracy theory says were hoaxed). <em>Nobody died.</em> </p>

<p>EDIT: By the way there is a lot of evidence that 9/11 was the same. There were no planes and nobody died. The buildings came down, but not in the way that we think. See here: <a href="http://septemberclues.info/">http://septemberclues.info/</a></p>

<p>It&#39;s a big leap to make, and I think you should be skeptical. I first watched 9/11 The New Pearl Harbor and spent several months thinking that the imagery we saw on TV was real but the buildings were brought down by controlled demolition. I still think they were brought down that way, but I no longer think the imagery was real, and I also believe nobody died. </p>

<p>Oh and also: partisan politics is a gimmick. And so is nationalism, capitalism vs. communism, etc. etc. The communists were financed by the same big banks that were financing the West. Communist leaders were installed by Western bankers, etc. etc. It&#39;s all done to keep our eyes off them by keeping us fighting each other and filling their pockets to buy weapons to kill each other with. </p>

<p>But don&#39;t take my word for it. Look into it. Check out Anthony Sutton&#39;s work on who financed Communism and Nazism. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s a good question. If they are trying to mislead us, how come they&#39;re revealing so much good information? Well, they have to salt their lies with the truth to make the misdirection harder to see. With Sandy Hook, I think they misdirected by trying to get people to think it was part of Obama&#39;s gun control agenda. This deepened the left-right schism and, as Miles pointed out, boosted gun sales tremendously. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ok, so having seen the video of the blacked out section right before plane 2 hits the tower and then the explosion makes sense to as the plane being just cgi or something. But if no one died on US soil, it would make sense to certain people being willing to go along with this. Sometimes I ask myself how could some like L Paul Bremmer do such a thing because I could not see myself killing innocent people, especially those with a close relationship to me. But if indeed it was a hoax and no one did die all he is really doing is lying and he could always fall back on that if it were to get revealed, look no one did die all I really did was lie. Although it is bad, it is a much easier thing to not feel horribly ashamed about when one is by themselves.</p>
