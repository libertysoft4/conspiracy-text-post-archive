        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I just got done watching on YouTube the documentary, &quot;An Open Secret,&quot; which is about pedophilia in Hollywood and they spent about 30 minutes talking about Brock Pierce who was heavily involved with a lot of convicted/accused pedophiles in Hollywood and was also accused of it himself. Well, that name really started to tickle my brain for some reason and started to look into him.  To keep in short I won&#39;t go into his full history, but there was a few key points that I found which may be how payments are facilitated in all this human/sex trafficking.</p>

<p>1)  Brock Pierce is one of the original founders\investors of BitCoin and in 2014 was elected as the Director of the Bitcoin Foundation.</p>

<p>2) He is the founder and Managing Partner of Blockchain Capital. Another cryptocurrency company.</p>

<p>3)  He is also a founder/advisor/investor of 12 other cryptocurrency companies.</p>

<p>and here is where it gets intertesting:</p>

<p>He is also a member of the Clinton Global Initiative where he does  &quot;philanthropic work,&quot; and is also a fundraiser for them.  There is also an article on the clintonfoundation.org website talking about his carbon footprint changes.</p>

<p>I think this may be how they launder their money for all the trafficking. They use all these cyptocurrency companies that PB is part of and it doesn&#39;t raise any flags and hard as hell to trace.</p>

<p>Or this is just an unlucky guy who happened to hang around a bunch of pedophiles back in the day and was falsely accused and just happens to like philanthropy work with the Clintions who are also getting wrongly accused.....\s</p>

<p>I apologize if this has been posted before or already talked about. I haven&#39;t seen it and just wanted everyone else opinions on it. If anyone has more to add or more research into this connection I would be interested in hearing it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think these are the connections we need to start going after instead of CCP and Alefantis. While those are important dots to be connected, there&#39;s way to much speculation without any hard evidence and its to easily used to discredit us, as recent events have shown. If we stay focused on the connections that have a little more evidence towards child abuse would make this a lot more creditable. Here we have a guy that has been accused of pedophilia, owned a company with a bunch a pedophiles and is a known sex offender who just also owns cryptocurrency companies. Hopefully we can find more connections like this to use to actual bring some hard evidence to p-gate.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree. CPP, Alefantis and the Podestas are red herrings at this point. Anything of value will have been cleaned up by professionals at this point, so continuing to pursue them is a waste of time and resources. We need to begin oblique attacks and start looking in places they don&#39;t expect yet. </p>

<p>I actually think this is why there is a huge push on &quot;fake news&quot; and why we are seeing MSM, Google, Youtube, and even Reddit push back. The research is getting dangerously close to something of value and TPTB are getting a little desparate. There was some valuable &#39;chan threads 404&#39;d in the past couple of weeks, and now the Norwegean cp news articles going away... It all smells of a blockade of something but we don&#39;t know what&#39;s being blockaded.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Exactly. But I think they would clean from the top of the pyramid down... The key to a breakthrough is focusing on the small guys. For example, the CEO of a company will likely have the strongest digital security, but maybe not the guy working in the warehouse. So, if the goal is to get onto the email server success is more likely cracking the forklift drivers server login rather than the CEO&#39;s. Likewise finding dirt on a small fry like Alefantis was easier than it would be on HRC. Now they see Alefantis is comprised the cleaners will be working on covering him up, but they may not have had the time or even thought of someone else... Like the limo driver or Lear jet pilot for example.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The most devastating thing <strong>any</strong> of us can do is simply explain it to people. Word of mouth is the most viral un-taintable way to get people involved.</p>

<p>Here is how I explain it (it takes about 20 minutes)</p>

<ol>
<li>Around June a whole bunch of reports started appearing that Wikileaks had emails that would &quot;lead to Clintons arrest&quot; (NYT, New Yorker, RT, ITV and others reported this but I can&#39;t find the source of the quote).</li>
<li>In July some anon guy on 4chan claims to be an FBI leak, and says the Clintons are into CP and trafficking. Everyone calls bullshit.</li>
<li>In September Kimdotcom claims Wikileaks has a nuclear bomb coming for Clinton.</li>
<li>In September Anthony Weiner gets arrested by the NY-SVU for sexting a 15 year old. The SVU confiscates his digital devices.</li>
<li>Also in September Anonymous claims a video of Bill Clinton molesting a child exists and may be part of the Wikileaks insurance file.</li>
<li>In October Assange promises 10 weeks of releases (starting October and ending mid-December)</li>
<li>Podesta emails get released and the famous PG8 emails are found (cheese pizze, pizza.jpg and the map) Someone noticed the code speak and people began searching the emails for similar references.</li>
<li>Kimdotcom started tweeting about a Oct.26 release date.</li>
<li>On Oct 17 fuckery happens at the Ecuadorian embassy. Assange&#39;s internet is cut, police vans are spotted. From this point onward Assange has never been seen at the embassy window. All proof of life for Assange is second hand, or questionable video. People begin to suspect a dead man&#39;s switch may be tripped.</li>
<li>Odd tweets and strange Wikileaks behavior begin. Wikileaks may be compromised.</li>
<li>October 24/25? A MASSIVE DDOS attack occurs. The ddos is so big it can only come from a nation with adequate computing abilities. I&#39;ve heard on a news report the ddos utilized unsecured bluetooth and wireless appliances like tv&#39;s and fridges and microwaves to assist in the attack. Something far beyond the skills of anonymous. Someone on reddit claims to have tracked the source to near a military base (not sure which thread that was or what base).</li>
<li>Oct 28 J.Comey re-opens the email investigation. Says they have received 650,000 emails from SVU from Weiner.<br/></li>
<li>FBI closes &quot;email investigation&quot; no new evidence. Interestingly during the FBI drama it was revealed the FBI had an active investigation into the Clinton Foundation. The FBI also stated they do not disclose active investigations, so there could possibly be other investigations active.</li>
<li>A 4Chan user claims to have detected a hash code embedded in the pizza.jpg file. Using this code he claims to have found a file and password stored on a mega.nz host. From this new un-seen photos of podesta appear as well as other unusual pics.</li>
<li>A discussion board discovers what might be the dead man’s switch password key hidden in bitcoin transactions. The data appears to have begun showing up shortly after the Oct.17 internet outage at the Ecuadorian embassy. The discussion board so far has been able to detect that the insurance file contains a couple of disk images, a series of spreadsheets and a few videos also. The method of discovering the insurance key is long and arduous so it may take a very long time to decode fully.</li>
<li>Following the Trump victory, the collective powers of CTR, and the media which includes Google, Twitter and Reddit move against the Pizzagate investigations. The term Fake News was invented around this time, also subreddits were closed, -chan discussion threads 404&#39;d, youtube videos deleted, and Google changes how search results are collected.</li>
</ol>

<p>Individually any <strong>ONE</strong> of the above points amounts to very little. However when looked at collectively a very disturbing theme emerges. </p>

<p>A. Pizzagate confirms FBI anon’s and possibly Anonymous’s claims of abuse.</p>

<p>B. The investigation in Weiner was related to child abuse also, and presumable some of the emails forwarded to the FBI were related to this.</p>

<p>C. <em>Someone</em> appears to have made a coordinated move against Wikileaks. </p>

<p>D. If Wikileaks has fallen, then the DMS is probably live, which is confirmed through the bitcoin research.</p>

<p>E. Based on the bitcoin research, the Wikileaks insurance file seems to contain video which may confirm Anonymous’s claims also.</p>

<p>Once you have outlined everything above, ask the following question….</p>

<p><strong>What would be so important as to cause the US, UK, and Ecuadorian governments, the mainstream media, digital media including Twitter, Google, and Reddit  all to collectively work together to put a stop to?</strong></p>

<p>Then… send whoever it is you are having the conversation with to Voat to check out pizzagate on their own. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think voat&#39;s time on this earth is limited. It&#39;s significantly smaller than reddit to killing the entire site won&#39;t create the huge outcry killing somethig like reddit would. Also, it would be very easy to spin a negative narrative about voat based upon many of contributions.</p>

<p>Pizzagate needs to look for a new host <strong>now</strong>. I think a reddit/voat clone hosted on an icelandic server is the best option. Unfortunately I personally dont have the time, finances or knowledge to pull something like that off.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think the time is right for the research to leave CCP and Alefantis behind as the focus. And furthermore, it seems to me that it would be ideal to change the name of things since P-gate is easy to search and censor. Obviously it&#39;s not easy to force something like that organically, but the 4chan threads on it go with &#39;Eyes Wide Open&#39;, which I think is better because they&#39;re words in the common lexicon.</p>

<p>Lots of great leads have been uncovered, there&#39;s lots to go on. The web of depravity is revealed to be bigger and more connected by the day. I certainly find what you&#39;ve uncovered to be interesting, so well done.</p>

<p>I appreciate you taking the time to contribute some potentially new leads. Thanks!</p>

It was a valuable foot in the door and there is no doubt disgusting things behind with that place. But it is only one of the trees in a vast forest: that forest is the real focus of the investigation.  I believe the CF is where the focus needs to be.</p>

<p>Here we have a guy that has been accused of pedophilia, owned a company with a bunch a pedophiles and is a known sex offender who just also owns cryptocurrency companies.</p>

<p>What significance do you think there is to him being a member of CGI? CGI has hundreds of members. It is basically a club for big companies paying 20k per year for sweet networking opportunities for their CEO.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.clintonfoundation.org/clinton-global-initiative/membership/frequently-asked-questions">https://www.clintonfoundation.org/clinton-global-initiative/membership/frequently-asked-questions</a></p>

<p>What mechanism is there here that suggests money laundering? This is not a position that has any control or involvement with the management of the organization. It is just membership in a club. If he didn&#39;t need any official control over the organization to pull off whatever illicit activities you think they were involved in, then wouldn&#39;t it make more sense to keep their relationship a bit more secret?</p>

<p>I would think that if I had a conspiracy to launder money for some sort of child sex ring, I wouldn&#39;t want to make public connections between those various partners unnecessarily. Why would they want him going around telling everyone about his relationship with GCI? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hansjörg Wyss needs to be investigated. Wyss is a reclusive Swiss billionaire whose company, Synthes, conducted illegal human experiments that resulted in the deaths of three elderly patients. Wyss and other Synthes executives decided to enter the highly profitable field of spinal surgery in 2000 with Norian XR, a cement-like mixture of calcium phosphate with barium sulfate. Company managers claimed the compound could act like bone when injected in the spine in a procedure called &quot;vertebrosplasty.&quot; CAP received $4.1 million from Wyss during Podesta&#39;s tenure as the liberal nonprofit&#39;s founding president and chief executive officer. The HJW Foundation, which is Wyss&#39;s private foundation, hired Podesta in 2013 as a paid consultant, for which he was paid $87,000 that year, according to the presidential counselor&#39;s financial disclosure statement. Wyss has a seat on CAP&#39;s 10-member board of directors, which also includes former Secretary of State Madeleine Albright; former Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle, D-S.D.; and Carol Browner, Obama&#39;s first energy czar and administrator of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. Wyss, who now lives in Wyoming, is a major donor to scores of liberal groups in this country, with his contributions estimated to total more than $110 million, according to the HJW Foundation&#39;s tax filings with the IRS since 2008. The Swiss Broadcasting Corp. reported last year that Wyss was the second-richest person in Switzerland. He is the 112th wealthiest man in the world, with a net worth estimated at $11.2 billion by Forbes magazine. In December 2014, Wyss contributed $5 million to The Clinton Foundation’s feminist “No Ceilings” project. Wyss told a Swiss newspaper in a rare interview in 2011 that &quot;nobody knows me, and I hope that it stays like this,&quot; according to Fortune. he original June 8 story highlighted Long’s case. She was a former employee at a Wyss foundation and at a California vineyard he owns. She described a lengthy intimate relationship with Wyss that allegedly turned violent and abusive. The 2013 settlement agreement provided a $1.5 million payment to Long and a provision in which both parties agreed to keep details of the agreement secret. Long enjoys wide support among Colorado’s law enforcement community, especially for her work in helping to form the Innocence Lost Project in that state. The program was started by the FBI in 2003 to help young girls who are captive in the sex trafficking trade. “The sexual behavior that Mr. Wyss required Ms. Long to participate in ran the full gamut of rather perverse sex acts,” DiMaria wrote, graphically outlining eight sex acts Wyss allegedly forced Long to endure. Jackie Long and Hansjorg Wyss have been supporters of Attention Homes(out of Boulder, CO) through the Runaway &amp; Homeless Youth program development and opening of the teen shelter in December 2010.<br/>

<p>Also Marion and Herb Sandler. Why: Marion look like a demon tbh. There is an interesting gap of time when you search Marion Sandler in the Podesta emails from 2009 to 2014. In the 2008/9 emails they worried about bad publicity about financial crisis(sold their business for like 24 Billion before pop). Marion Sandler died in 2012. But in 2014 Podesta has a google alert for Marion. Also in 2014 they are sending each other early 2003 messages about the formation of CenterForAmericanProgress, which the Sandler&#39;s seem to be integral in. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes to foreign transactions. The blockchain (underlying data structure for bitcoin) is precisely an open ledger. If you use your bitcoin wallet for illegal activities and 5-0 manages to associate you with that wallet then you are toast. Pretty much how they rolled up as much of the Silk Road network as they wanted once they&#39;d managed to identify Dread Pirate Whoever.</p>

<p>Bitcoin and ethereum both use the blockchain. It&#39;ll be applying to a lot of other things not even remotely related to crypto currencies too.

<p>For a TV show Mr. Robot was pretty good. For a technology trainer, not so much. I was particularly annoyed at the assertion that Gnome was better than KDE. I&#39;d guess that the writers did some googling, but they are clearly n00bs.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Had to chime in here on some things as I frequent this /r and r/bitcoin for many years.</p>

<p>He did not found bitcoin. Bitcoin&#39;s underlying principals/code is open source and can be evaluated by anyone. </p>

<p>BlockChain capital is a venture company that invests money (USD i believe) in startups in the bitcoin space. This works like virtually any other company in principal, it&#39;s just instead of working on widgets - they work with things related to bitcoin. Not sure at what scale these entities actually OWN bitcoin for operations/testing purposes though. </p>

<p>I think it&#39;s important to clarify these points. I&#39;m a big proponent of bitcoin and actually see it as an alternative/solution to the mania we&#39;re seeing in r/conspiracy (for what it&#39;s worth). </p>

<p>I REALLY don&#39;t think there&#39;s a correlation between this stuff and bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies. The bitcoin foundation has been considered a joke of an organization for sometime (in fact I was under the impression it has dissolved). One of the other persons involved Gavin Andresen who used to be one of the core devs was famously outed from the community for believing that an australian guy was satoshi nakamoto. Long story here, but it wasn&#39;t: </p>

<p><a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2016/05/bitcoin-creator-revealed/480711/">http://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2016/05/bitcoin-creator-revealed/480711/</a></p>

<p>I suppose crypto currencies could be used for the purposes mentioned, but the only trouble I see in believing this is liquidity and amounts. Bitcoin is still a small market, and the other currencies even smaller (where only thousands of $ can move markets), and getting money in and out is rather difficult - there are a handful of large exchanges/brokerages. </p>

<p>I agree. But if there ever <em>was</em> an anonymous way to instantly move a lot of money, bitcoin could fit the bill. There are sometimes address with tons of bitcoin being moved all at once. Probably no correlation, but interesting. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>There is so much wrong with this that it&#39;s hard to choose where to start. I&#39;m on phone right now, so writing at length is difficult, but i&#39;ll leave a few notes.</p>

<p>Brock Pierce is not a founder of <em>Bitcoin</em>. He was elected as Director to an irrelevant Foundation to much public outcry (causing many to resign and stop paying fees). All he had was money, which he threw around and lost a lot of.</p>

<p>Laundering via crypto currencies, especially Bitcoin, is the height of stupidity. The exchanges are heavily controlled and monitored by government and regulations. You can&#39;t exchange notable amounts of currency without dozens of governmental alarms going off. </p>

<p>More importantly, all of your transactions with crypto are public and stored forever. Cash and existing bank systems are far less risky.</p>

<p>Now, there may certainly be validity in the rest of what is covered, but any attempts to spin him as someone important in Bitcoin, or being able to use Bitcoin to launder significant sums... are so far off base.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Bitcoin looks like a civil war right now, and maybe mostly because of this. There&#39;s been a coup. Blockstream&#39;s shady and blackmailable people are now mostly in charge of paying the main developers, and are taking decisions to control and/or make it fail. Huge Chinese miners have lots of user control too</p>

<p>Right now there&#39;s been accounts of taking more than 48 hours (instead of 10 min) to confirm a payment because of the block size limitations imposed. Some technologies are being proposed to scale up, but some of them would mean huge control and money for vultures</p>

<p>Bitcoin has many vultures around, think banks/fed/governments... And this would be making them obsolete. The p2p blockchain and cryptography technologies used by bitcoin allow to invent your own economic system, your own currency, do instant voting, decision making and consensus, proof of identity and ownership, legal contracts... </p>

<p>It could even stop the money for the war machine and mafias:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>we could simply refuse to pay taxes to the gov to fund wars, or dedicate and manage gov budgets, and decide what parts to fund</p></li>
<li><p>banks would not exist, so they would not be investing and profiteering with armament companies like they do now</p></li>
<li><p>all CIA and co. secret operations (hi ISIS) fueled with drug money like the Afghan heroin trade or the Iran-Contra cocaine that destroyed the black youth with its crack epidemic... 
All this could be solved with a simple webpage like silkroad (eBay for drugs) but anonymous and p2p (like openbazaar.org) </p></li>
</ul>

<p>The weak points of Bitcoin are its governance and decision making, where Dash coin tries to solve this and be more Democratic. This could work</p>

<p>And its anonymity, but for that there are solutions too, like tumblers or Monero coin</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I kinda get what your saying but i don&#39;t need to be using a cryptocurrency at supermarkets or for any other regular things. The only other reason i can see for using a cryptocurrency is for nefarious reasons. Non declaration of funds , cp , illicit transactions.
I don&#39;t have that much of a need for a cryptocurrency unless i&#39;d think there was financial &quot;valley&quot; upcoming as it may offer some stability.</p>

<p>Also the government doesn&#39;t outright decide the value of a currency  it merely attempts to do so.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve never seen the currency of the government so unreliable except in the even of a financial even.</p>

<p>I just don&#39;t want to support or be a part of a cryptocurrency sytem which is perfect for pedophiles and other illicit actors.
It just begs for federal attention. There should be another lesser way</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sure, using a crypto currency at a super market is a bit like using a flamethrower to take out a hornets nest. It works, but it might be overkill.</p>

<p>However, there aren&#39;t really any other options. If you don&#39;t support the concept of crypto currencies, then you&#39;re stuck using a government issued, Rothschild sponsored state currency. If you don&#39;t like either of those ideas, then you can go out and write your own world changing white paper that redefines the concept of money like satoshi did :) </p>

<p>Honestly, this whole thread is fucking ridiculous. Bitcoin is exactly the type of thing this community should be supporting. If you don&#39;t like the current system, don&#39;t just bitch about it, take action and put your money into an alternative. This takes away the power of TPTB better than any amount of #pizzagate babbling. If we all switch to an alternative means to exchange value between us, the current global powers fall apart and we can just be people. This is how we beat the system, by giving people a better choice.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I mean, this question is answered every day on <a href="/r/Bitcoin">/r/Bitcoin</a> and <a href="/r/btc">/r/btc</a> . At this point I would generally recommend localbitcoins.com or coinbase.com . coinbase gets a lot of gruff on <a href="/r/Bitcoin">/r/Bitcoin</a> for complying with the IRS, but I can&#39;t really fault them for that. Sometimes the best option to overcome the system is to work within it. </p>

<p>Keep in mind, there is a lot of infighting within the bitcoin community lately, or at least we&#39;re given the appearance that is the case. I think a lot of it is manufactured by TPTB to create FUD, the reality is the price of bitcoin has remained strong despite everything that&#39;s happened, so I&#39;m remaining optimistic. It&#39;s interesting times, stop by and do some research before you jump in.</p>
