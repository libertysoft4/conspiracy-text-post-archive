    <div class="md"><p>They used the abortion issue as long as they could, then gay marriage, guns, etc. All the complete b.s. issues that you should not decide a leader on at the national level. I was surprised to se abortion pop back up this time.
I am super pro 2nd, pro choice, pro marriage equality (or govt out of marriage whichever).</p>

<p>I try to stay logical at all times and I am mindfucked. They did a good job. Is Trump legit anti establishment, possibly. News today though leads me to believe something is going to happen, like he wasn&#39;t supposed to win (the news being CIA &quot;confirming&quot; Russia interferred, while simultaneously Trump chooses an Exxon CEO a company who allegedly had a multi hundred billion dollar deal stalled by sanctions on Russia after the invasion of Crimea). Before Trump I believed elections were rigged (even thought he was a fake candidate up until he really started bringing out the dirty stuff) and maybe they are, but Hillary could have easily taken it if the elections are rigged. Of course it&#39;s possible Trump was supposed to do this.</p>

<p>It&#39;s all got me thinking this has nothing to do with Russia and everything to do with dividing America. They already have the two political sides hating each other enough to commit physical violence, and honestly, some would kill each other over it no doubt. Then again the wikileaks and fake news and new propaganda bill make me think things happened that were legit anti establishment.
I am just completely unsure, but I do think if it&#39;s a put on, it&#39;s about dividing us in a severe way.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you actually just take a step back you will realize nothing happened that was anti-establishment. Nothing. And here&#39;s why: because nothing <em>actually</em> happened yet and nothing will. As in, it&#39;s all just talk. Remember, Trump stated, even before he was elected, that he will expand the NSA, renew the Patriot Act, not abolish the Fed, infringe on the second amendment without trial, and loves Israel. That is as establishment as it gets. That&#39;s Obama 2.0/Bush 3.0.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, well I knew his platform was b.s. I was just solely anti Clinton. Not an actual Trump supporter. </p>

<p>I really think Clinton wanted to go down in history as the first female president. Before this election I fully believed the elected officials were chosen.</p>

<p>Who knows though maybe she was told from high on up that it just couldn&#39;t be and that we needed to divide the people more than she needed to be the first female pres.</p>

<p>However, some of his moves have been pretty anti establishment in regard to Russia. At least the conflict of interest of this appointment. It could be seen as a middle finger to the fact that the US and EU fomented revolution in the Ukraine and the Russian sanctions would be lifted. I mean, the dude might not, but Obama admins sanctions allegedly stopped a 500 billion dollar deal with Russia with his corp.. if that&#39;s a true story and not just a news story to make him seem like a conflict of interest appointment.</p>

<p>Honestly the news is so full of b.s. how do I know.</p>

<p>We really need to break it down and get all new officials and media laws and funding laws regarding campaigns and lobbyists.
It&#39;s too much of a mess, makes my head spin.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t must of us are anti-American government at all. We&#39;re against corruption in government, many of us even consider ourselves patriotic. If anything, some of us have hope that we can turn this country around.

<p>My post on it was simplified because I wasn&#39;t looking to write an essay, but that isn&#39;t to say my take on it is simple.</p>

<p>Either way I&#39;ve come to the conclusion that we&#39;re just harder on the U.S. government because most of us here are American, and it makes sense to have your own house in order first before worrying about others. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>dude, I can understand that maybe what you&#39;re saying makes sense according to your present worldview, but I promise you that is not how things actually are. There is leaked email after leaked email that demonstrates beyond any doubt that Hillary has done not just one or two things that would ordinarily lead to a prison sentence, but many, many things that would ordinarily lead to a prison sentence. Beyond that, you really don&#39;t even have to comb through any emails at all, because even the use of her private server and her mishandling of classified documents is itself sufficient reason for a prison sentence, and would most definitely result in prison if a civilian were to do it. (it&#39;s the same charge as Snowden&#39;s and Chelsea Manning&#39;s, it&#39;s pretty black and white.) My point being, looking at this stuff as though the absence of criminal charges and prison time is positive evidence in favor of innocence is a completely insufficient viewpoint, and it can be shown to be so very easily by very simple evaluation. Please consider these things as you continue forming your own beliefs. Cheers</p>
