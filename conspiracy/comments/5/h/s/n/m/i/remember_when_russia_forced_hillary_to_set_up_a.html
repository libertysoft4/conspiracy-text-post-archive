<p>You are not watching or listening to any news. There have been countless pieces about why she lost that do not involve blaming Russia. Primarily, they discuss her over confidence in the rust belt being so high that she didn&#39;t bother with campaign stops. </p>

<p>There are no shortage of MSM stories about the campaigns failings.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, I think part of the issue is the framing in how you seem to think &quot;news&quot; works.</p>

<p>It&#39;s not the job of news programs to run a story like &quot;Why Hillary lost the election&quot; because that is primarily an opinion piece. Discussions like that happen on the &quot;talking head&quot; shows and in op-ed articles in papers. </p>

<p>It is news, however, to report on Russian hacking or Trump skipping intel briefings. Because those are in fact, news. It doesn&#39;t mean Russia was to blame, but the discussion about throughout DC is a news-worthy item.</p>

<p>So if you primarily just tune into your local nightly news program, I wouldn&#39;t expect you to see it. But if you turn on any of the cable news networks, there have been no shortage of those discussions. </p>

<p>I think those &quot;you people&quot; would like to see some actual evidence of &quot;Russian meddling.&quot;  Is the argument, seriously, that the best Russia could come up with was releasing the DNC&#39;s own emails?  No ballot box stuffing?  No vote machine hacking?  Just . . . releasing some of Podesta&#39;s emails?  But not other folks (other than the ones in Podesta&#39;s box)?  What lame hackers. </p>

<p>That doesn&#39;t feel like meddling.  That feels like a whistleblower.  Or maybe investigative journalism.   But pretty weak sauce for a technically savvy nation.   Also: where&#39;s the evidence?  This feels like a simple repeat of Team Clinton propaganda, in an effort to flip the Electoral College.  (And that&#39;s exactly what it is, btw).</p>

<p>There is a major push by both sides to take this away from Trump, and it will ramp up from now until the Electoral College does its thing.</p>

<p>This is the problem with running corrupt candidates from a national security perspective.  Revealing the truth becomes blackmail.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;Russia rigged the election by informing Americans of what we&#39;ve been doing for the past 6 months!&quot;</p>

<p>Sounds an awful lot like the DNC&#39;s attempted Trump smear when they called him out for saying the media was rigging it against him.</p>

<p>I remember someone (I think Colbert) satirizing him by saying &quot;The media is rigging the election against Trump by showing clips of Trump speaking!&quot;</p>

<p>When in reality a lot of the clips shown of Trump speaking were, in fact, <em>clips</em> and not the full argument he was making.</p>

<p>The difference with Hillary is that we got the full context. There were no partial emails on WL. </p>

<p>even the so called &quot;source&quot; says its &quot;someone with connections to Russia&quot;. Hillary has connections to Russia, Buzz Aldrin his connections to Russia, Colin Powell has connections to Russia - what does that phrase even mean? This &quot;news&quot; itself Sounds like it&#39;s been generated/engineered in such a way as to drive a story where evidence for one does not exist.</p>

<p>If there was a plausible theory put forward (even without firm evidence or sources) detailing who was involved and why they might do this, I&#39;d be all ears. </p>

<p>The WaPo saying &quot;Russia did it&quot; however does smack of sore losers.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s not. It&#39;s an amalgamation of different people with different ideas. Yours included! Mods are openly neutral and transparent. Which is why you are able to see a shift at all (rather than mods controlling a narrative so that r/conspiracy&#39;s aesthetic never changes) Given the history and the nature of governance, of course 99.9% of r/conspiracy are going to be skeptical of all government, and if one &quot;team&quot; promises smaller government, and the other promises bigger government, it makes sense that some, up to and including the majority of r/conspiracy might become attracted to the team promising smaller government. Especially when the leader of that team had to fight a grueling, bitter fight with a common enemy (the MSM) to get there.</p>

<p>If there&#39;s any blindness, I will confess, it is because the MSM have time and time again shot themselves in the foot, and I just refuse believe anything they say anymore. It will take someone like you to come up with a convincing argument (and that argument is not &quot;he&#39;s racist, he&#39;s sexist, he&#39;s XYZ&quot;). With regards to the MSM It&#39;s boy who cried wolf syndrome, and they&#39;re still doing it with all this Russian hacking nonsense, so no reason to believe they have changed.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Assange also runs the organization that withheld info they have on Trump and only released stuff that was harmful towards Hillary. He isn&#39;t infallible and he has biases of his own, just like everyone else. What I&#39;m trying to say is he could have reasons of his own for insinuating that Rich was the leaker. And honestly we don&#39;t even really know where Julian is right now, let alone if he&#39;s alive. Wikileaks has likely been compromised, and they have an agenda, as evidenced by their timing of the release of the leaks and their not leaking hacked RNC info.</p>

<p>When the entire intelligence community is claiming that Russia influenced the election, we should at least take it seriously and not dismiss it. The democrats don&#39;t singlehandedly control all of the intelligence agencies. And this isn&#39;t new news, they&#39;ve been saying this for months. Is there a smoking gun? No. Is there sufficient evidence to say with certainty that Russia interfered? No. But there is enough to warrant an investigation.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree with most of what you said... except for that he withheld information on trump. Wikileaks as an organization has never been known to withheld any info for personal motives, and assange explicitly said that nobody had leaked him any info on trump or republicans and that if they had he would have verified and published it. Wikileaks doesn&#39;t have control over who they get information on...</p>

<p>Also, not sure how this is turning into a discussion on trump as i only said its possible that the corrupt started this rumor because they feared him following through on draining the swamp... regardless: we found out from wikileaks that the owners of citibank picked obamas cabinet for him. You know, the same people from saudi arabia that hillary clinton took money from despite having acknowledged that they fund isis. The same people that were publicly mocking trump saying he would never be president and after he was elected told him to bow down. Not saying i agree or disagree with any of his picks... but it is definitely going to be very different from what we&#39;ve seen over the bush/obama/clinton years.</p>

<p>But on to russian interference, i haven&#39;t heard any credible info as to how exactly they interfered other than potentially leaking the podesta emails (his email password was &quot;password&quot; btw... so not exactly tough to hack). To me, unless they did something more substantial then it hardly justifies retaliation or action as some are suggesting... I just don&#39;t understand how when the secretary of state takes top secret classified info off of secure government devices and uploads them on a private, illegal, unsecure server that the FBI says was hacked 5 times presumably by world powers, no one gives the slightest shit in the world and gives her a get out of jail free card. </p>

<p>Honestly if her and podesta weren&#39;t so careless with information vital to national security or privacy, maybe they don&#39;t deserve to be running the country?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I also agree with most of what you&#39;re saying here. I think Hillary&#39;s law-breaking, constant lying, and flat out untrustworthiness are what <em>really</em> killed her campaign, but the purported Russian disinformation could have really tipped the election in Trump&#39;s favor. I mean it was a pretty close election, so something like that (along with the timing of the leaks) could have wound up being a deciding factor.</p>

<p>But at the end of the day, it was just a propaganda campaign, I don&#39;t think it was more than that like actually altering votes or machines based off of the current info. So I don&#39;t think that any kind of <em>extreme</em> measures need to be taken necessarily. But there needs to be <em>some</em> kind of response if it&#39;s proven that Russia did interfere, diplomatically or otherwise. </p>

<p>Spot on about Hillary and Obama, but I don&#39;t really see Trump&#39;s reign being much different from a typical republican presidency. He&#39;s going to defer to Pence on things like policy decisions and that says it all. The guy is in over his head, though I like how he&#39;s telling China to fuck off. </p>

<p>As far as Assange, I also remember him saying in an interview something along the lines of &quot;what we have on Trump wouldn&#39;t be worse than what he&#39;s saying all the time&quot;. So that kind of implied to me that they do in fact have dirt on him, along with reports that the RNC was hacked as well, with no release (though it&#39;s possible Wikileaks just didn&#39;t get those leaks from whoever hacked them). </p>

<p>Honestly can&#39;t say I really blame Julian though. Our government shit on him, I would want to send the country into disarray too if I was him lol.</p>

<p>Sorry but you just sound stupid when you say someone who is dying would have admitted something like that... and EVEN in the slight chance that he did. Do you think ambulance or police would say anything after seeing this guy getting murdered for what he did? As if whoever did it is above killing them too?</p>

<p>But no... its gotta be russia because seth rich didn&#39;t say anything as he was gurgling up blood when trying to breathe just to stay alive.</p>

<p>So you have no actual evidence he was the source of the leaks, other than innuendo. Got it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Available evidence should certainly be discussed, so it&#39;s great that you posted it.</p>

<p>But I as well as others find the evidence weak/circumstantial/based on claims of biased parties. It is not necessary for me to prove that someone else is responsible or prove that Russia has an alibi (&quot;it was hanging out with Finland that week, witness reindeer confirm&quot;), merely to point out the faults in your evidence.</p>

<p>So your demand that someone provide &quot;evidence that Russia didn&#39;t hack&quot; is excessive, while your claim that Russia did hack does require proof. The logical onus is on the one making the original accusation.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There doesn&#39;t seem to be any.  It&#39;s almost as if Clinton makes stuff up and the media reports it.</p>

<p>My understanding is that the &quot;hack&quot; was mostly a release of Podesta&#39;s emails - which sounds like someone guessed his idiotically password (which supposedly was p@ssw0rd).  </p>

<p>That doesn&#39;t feel like the might of the Russian intelligence apparatus.  And you can bet, given that Hillary didn&#39;t even have as much security as Podesta on her server, that the Russians really do have her emails, and that those are plenty incriminating (the FBI has said its 99% that 5 hostile agencies penetrated her server).   But Hillary&#39;s emails/server contents have not been released.</p>

<p>Logic suggests that it was inside job, by someone with lucky and limited access.  Meanwhile, unknown agencies have the contents of Hillary&#39;s &quot;secret server.&quot;  And the US media continues to disgrace itself.</p>

All they had was Russia, Russia, Russia and Nazi&#39;s- even though Trump is a known supporter of the Jews and its public record that Hillary has more ties to Russia than Trump with her Uranium One Deal.</p>

<p>Democrat here.</p>

<p>You can go ahead and try and explain and justify, try to be dismissive and willfully ignorant. Im just going to leave this here for you to think about. Anyone saying there is nothing in the leaks hasnt read them and was counting on CNN or the WaPo to show you the context. </p>

<p><a href="https://www.fbi.gov/investigate/terrorism">https://www.fbi.gov/investigate/terrorism</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Definitions of Terrorism in U.S. Code 
18 U.S.C. § 2331 defines &quot;international terrorism&quot; and &quot;domestic terrorism&quot; for purposes of Chapter 113B of the U.S. Code, entitled &quot;Terrorism.”</p>

<p>&quot;International terrorism&quot; means activities with the following three characteristics:</p>

<p>Involve violent acts or acts dangerous to human life that violate federal or state law;
Appear to be intended<br/>
(i) to intimidate or coerce a civilian population;<br/>
(ii) to influence the policy of a government by intimidation or coercion; or<br/>
(iii) to affect the conduct of a government by mass destruction, assassination, or kidnapping; and
Occur primarily outside the territorial jurisdiction of the U.S., or transcend national boundaries in terms of the means by which they are accomplished, the persons they appear intended to intimidate or coerce, or the locale in which their perpetrators operate or seek asylum.*      </p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is important because it defines who a particular set of enemies of the state are.</p>

<hr/>

<p>First the Email in Question and what Assange actually said about it: <a href="https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/7243">https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/7243</a> (Note it was Published on 10/13/16)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>At the same time we should return to plans to provide the FSA, or some group of moderate forces, with equipment that will allow them to deal with a weakened ISIL, and stepped up operations against the Syrian regime. This entire effort should be done with a low profile, avoiding the massive traditional military operations that are at best temporary solutions. While this military/para-military operation is moving forward, <strong>we need to use our diplomatic and more traditional intelligence assets to bring pressure on the governments of Qatar and Saudi Arabia, which are providing clandestine financial and logistic support to ISIL and other radical Sunni groups in the region.</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Its necessary to point out that the significance of this email is not what it literally states, obviously the US would rather limit ISIS&#39; influence in the region. The context is that the US knew that Saudi Arabia was arming ISIS when the <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-saudi-security-idUSKCN11D2JQ">US State Department approved $115 Billion Dollars worth of arms deals to Saudi Arabia</a></p>

<p><a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/articleiii">Cornell University sites the US Constitution defining Treason</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Treason against the United States, shall consist only in levying War against them, or in <strong>adhering to their Enemies, giving them Aid and Comfort.</strong> No Person shall be convicted of Treason unless on the Testimony of two Witnesses to the same overt Act, or on Confession in open Court.</p>

<p>ARTICLE III, SECTION 3, CLAUSE 1 </p>
</blockquote>

<p>You can decide that this isnt actually treasonous. But you should know that this comes as close as any Presidential Candidate has ever got to crossing that line. Chances are that if you disagree about Clinton or Kerry or Obama&#39;s culpability in this matter, you would have said Reagan and Oliver North were Traitors if you were asked 5 years ago. For more context, keep reading.</p>

<p>CNN reported that <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2015/12/08/politics/amnesty-international-isis-weapons-u-s-/index.html">ISIS was armed with American Weapons</a> in December, 2015; and if you read the actual <a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/mde14/2812/2015/en/">Amnesty.org</a> report it says (Pg. 20, 21):</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It is also likely that some of the small arms in IS’ possession – such as an M4 carbine-style Bushmaster X15E2S manufactured in the USA and documented in IS’ arsenal entered Iraq with private security companies during the US occupation and found their way into Iraqi arms markets.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A few months prior <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/jun/03/us-isis-syria-iraq">The Guardian reported:</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>a recently declassified <a href="http://www.judicialwatch.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Pg.-291-Pgs.-287-293-JW-v-DOD-and-State-14-812-DOD-Release-2015-04-10-final-version11.pdf">secret US intelligence report</a>, written in August 2012, which uncannily predicts – and effectively welcomes – the prospect of a “Salafist principality” in eastern Syria and an al-Qaida-controlled Islamic state in Syria and Iraq. In stark contrast to western claims at the time, the Defense Intelligence Agency document identifies al-Qaida in Iraq (which became Isis) and fellow Salafists as the “major forces driving the insurgency in Syria” – and states that “western countries, the Gulf states and Turkey” were supporting the opposition’s efforts to take control of eastern Syria.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Clinton openly criticized the Saudi, Qatari, and Kuwaiti governments for failing “to stop their citizens from funding extremist organizations.” Her newly released 2014 email goes a step further, directly attributing support for ISIS to the Saudi government.</p>

ISIS has <a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/pictures/isis-attacks-a-timeline-of-terror/1/">claimed responsibility for attacks</a> (CBS) on Belgium when they <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/23/world/europe/brussels-airport-explosions.html">bombed the airport at Brussels</a> (NYT), France at Charlie Hebdo and <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/15/world/europe/isis-claims-responsibility-for-paris-attacks-calling-them-miracles.html">Bataclan theater</a> (NYT), Australia, Russia, Lebanon and others that could potentially lay financial culpability on the US. </p>

<p>This has had significant effect on international relationships too that threaten <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pax_Europaea">the longest peace in western Europe</a> since Augustus Caeser.

</blockquote>

<p>The US created the Refugee Crisis in Europe by knowingly arming ISIS and is why <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/opinion/2016/07/turexit-turkey-leave-nato-160721105010182.html">Turkey may leave NATO</a> (Al Jazeera); This is why <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2014/09/04/world/europe/uk-nato-summit/index.html">Russia</a> (CNN) may invade the rest of Ukraine.

<p>In short, Assange did not over-hype <a href="https://www.rt.com/news/319797-syria-depopulation-refugees-assange/">the ramifications of US involvement in Syria.</a></p>

<p>And that should suffice for incriminating and substantiated things not adequately covered in the media. The left seems to think they can point a finger at Russia while not addressing anything in the emails. If all that Russia released simply amounted to a bad segment on The Today Show and had nothing of any substance to it, how would it have effected the election? How <em>could</em> it? Not to deflect, but Carlos Slim (the riches man in Mexico) owns the NYT. Is Mexico interfering with US politics? Or are they simply publishing truth? Anyone that thinks WL was &quot;manipulating the election&quot; by publishing primary sources <em>and</em> thinks it is okay for NYT to publish without the same degree of skepticism is being intellectually dishonest and hypocritical.</p>

<p>Also, good source on your little factoid that was reported by Breitbart and the numbers came from the &quot;Government Accountability Institute&quot;.

<p>So, you&#39;re saying it&#39;s not true that he missed half of those meetings, and after that you agree that he did miss a lot of these meetings?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Here is a good one covered by a couple of outlets to some degree but lacking in the context. You can go ahead and try and explain and justify, try to be dismissive and willfully ignorant. Im just going to leave this here for you to think about.</p>

<p>Anyone saying there is nothing in the leaks hasnt read them and was counting on CNN or the WaPo to show you the context</p>

<p><a href="https://www.fbi.gov/investigate/terrorism">https://www.fbi.gov/investigate/terrorism</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Definitions of Terrorism in U.S. Code 
18 U.S.C. § 2331 defines &quot;international terrorism&quot; and &quot;domestic terrorism&quot; for purposes of Chapter 113B of the U.S. Code, entitled &quot;Terrorism.”</p>

<p>&quot;International terrorism&quot; means activities with the following three characteristics:</p>

<p>Involve violent acts or acts dangerous to human life that violate federal or state law;
Appear to be intended<br/>
(i) to intimidate or coerce a civilian population;<br/>
(ii) to influence the policy of a government by intimidation or coercion; or<br/>
(iii) to affect the conduct of a government by mass destruction, assassination, or kidnapping; and
Occur primarily outside the territorial jurisdiction of the U.S., or transcend national boundaries in terms of the means by which they are accomplished, the persons they appear intended to intimidate or coerce, or the locale in which their perpetrators operate or seek asylum.*      </p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is important because it defines who a particular set of enemies of the state are.</p>

<hr/>

<p>First the Email in Question and what Assange actually said about it: <a href="https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/7243">https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/7243</a> (Note it was Published on 10/13/16)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>At the same time we should return to plans to provide the FSA, or some group of moderate forces, with equipment that will allow them to deal with a weakened ISIL, and stepped up operations against the Syrian regime. This entire effort should be done with a low profile, avoiding the massive traditional military operations that are at best temporary solutions. While this military/para-military operation is moving forward, <strong>we need to use our diplomatic and more traditional intelligence assets to bring pressure on the governments of Qatar and Saudi Arabia, which are providing clandestine financial and logistic support to ISIL and other radical Sunni groups in the region.</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Its necessary to point out that the significance of this email is not what it literally states, obviously the US would rather limit ISIS&#39; influence in the region. The context is that the US knew that Saudi Arabia was arming ISIS when the <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-saudi-security-idUSKCN11D2JQ">US State Department approved $115 Billion Dollars worth of arms deals to Saudi Arabia</a></p>

<p><a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/articleiii">Cornell University sites the US Constitution defining Treason</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Treason against the United States, shall consist only in levying War against them, or in <strong>adhering to their Enemies, giving them Aid and Comfort.</strong> No Person shall be convicted of Treason unless on the Testimony of two Witnesses to the same overt Act, or on Confession in open Court.</p>

<p>ARTICLE III, SECTION 3, CLAUSE 1 </p>
</blockquote>

<p>You can decide that this isnt actually treasonous. But you should know that this comes as close as any Presidential Candidate has ever got to crossing that line. Chances are that if you disagree about Clinton or Kerry or Obama&#39;s culpability in this matter, you would have said Reagan and Oliver North were Traitors if you were asked 5 years ago. For more context, keep reading.</p>

<p>CNN reported that <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2015/12/08/politics/amnesty-international-isis-weapons-u-s-/index.html">ISIS was armed with American Weapons</a> in December, 2015; and if you read the actual <a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/mde14/2812/2015/en/">Amnesty.org</a> report it says (Pg. 20, 21):</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It is also likely that some of the small arms in IS’ possession – such as an M4 carbine-style Bushmaster X15E2S manufactured in the USA and documented in IS’ arsenal entered Iraq with private security companies during the US occupation and found their way into Iraqi arms markets.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A few months prior <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/jun/03/us-isis-syria-iraq">The Guardian reported:</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>a recently declassified <a href="http://www.judicialwatch.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Pg.-291-Pgs.-287-293-JW-v-DOD-and-State-14-812-DOD-Release-2015-04-10-final-version11.pdf">secret US intelligence report</a>, written in August 2012, which uncannily predicts – and effectively welcomes – the prospect of a “Salafist principality” in eastern Syria and an al-Qaida-controlled Islamic state in Syria and Iraq. In stark contrast to western claims at the time, the Defense Intelligence Agency document identifies al-Qaida in Iraq (which became Isis) and fellow Salafists as the “major forces driving the insurgency in Syria” – and states that “western countries, the Gulf states and Turkey” were supporting the opposition’s efforts to take control of eastern Syria.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Maybe you would like <a href="https://theintercept.com/2016/10/12/hillary-clinton-acknowledges-saudi-terror-financing-in-hacked-email-hinting-at-tougher-approach/">The Intercept</a> to clarify a few things:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Clinton openly criticized the Saudi, Qatari, and Kuwaiti governments for failing “to stop their citizens from funding extremist organizations.” Her newly released 2014 email goes a step further, directly attributing support for ISIS to the Saudi government.</p>

<p>The US created the Refugee Crisis in Europe by knowingly arming ISIS and is why <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/opinion/2016/07/turexit-turkey-leave-nato-160721105010182.html">Turkey may leave NATO</a> (Al Jazeera); This is why <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2014/09/04/world/europe/uk-nato-summit/index.html">Russia</a> (CNN) may invade the rest of Ukraine.

<p>In short, Assange did not over-hype <a href="https://www.rt.com/news/319797-syria-depopulation-refugees-assange/">the ramifications of US involvement in Syria.</a></p>

<p>And that should suffice for incriminating and substantiated things not adequately covered in the media. The left seems to think they can point a finger at Russia while not addressing anything in the emails. If all that Russia released simply amounted to a bad segment on The Today Show and had nothing of any substance to it, how would it have effected the election? How <em>could</em> it? Not to deflect, but Carlos Slim (the riches man in Mexico) owns the NYT. Is Mexico interfering with US politics? Or are they simply publishing truth? Anyone that thinks WL was &quot;manipulating the election&quot; by publishing primary sources <em>and</em> thinks it is okay for NYT to publish without the same degree of skepticism is being intellectually dishonest and hypocritical.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You arent citing any sources for any of your claims. You think I am being partisan but I am the one that acknowledged fault on both sides of the aisle for 3 separate arms deals. And yes, the SoS can kill an arms deal on her own.

I pointed out exactly how this is just like Contra which was illegal and people convicted, so this clears that goalpost but the goalpost set in this conversation was you asking for policy or secret that was compromised. What I linked you to was a TS email that originated with the SoS. That is something you and I should not be able to read for obvious reasons. But here we are.

<p>This isnt true. The president can <em>prevent</em> SoS from acting in certain ways but the SoS can also pressure the President. That is why cabinet positions exist. So the President doesn&#39;t have to do everything. SoS does not run everything through the president and may also limit the things that get to the President. So if the SoS wanted to prevent a foreign government with furnishing enemies of the state with american weapons all they would have to do is not negotiate with terrorist sponsoring states. </p>

<p>Hillary Clinton&#39;s &quot;Reset&quot; policy towards Russia as Secretary of State was an absolute failure.  She completely screwed the pooch when it came to diplomacy with Russia.  This was during the Medvedev administration, early in Obama&#39;s presidency, well before Putin&#39;s involvement in Ukraine or Syria, and if she hadn&#39;t totally mishandled our relationship with Russia things may have turned out differently over the past 8 years.</p>

<p>The government should have known that it was only a matter of time before the Russians tried to attack Hillary Clinton in some way.  They know full well how much she&#39;s despised in Russia, not just by the government but by the common people.  So why the fuck were they so lax about cyber security when they knew that Russian hackers were a universal threat and that they had a personal grudge against Hillary in particular?</p>

<p>but they certainly seem to have targeted Clinton</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I would be surprised if they didn&#39;t. Apparently, Clinton&#39;s private server was easy to find, and more than one foreign intelligence agency knows the secrets that it contained.</p>

<p>But if we&#39;re being specific, then we&#39;re discussing the leaks that actually affected the election: the DNC leaks and John Podesta&#39;s email. For the DNC leaks, Assange all but bluntly states that it was leaked (not hacked) by Seth Rich:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kp7FkLBRpKg">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kp7FkLBRpKg</a></p>

<p>For Podesta&#39;s email, we don&#39;t have the name of the leaker, but in the Pilger interview, Assange says that leak is from a &quot;Washington insider&quot;. Craig Murray, an associate of Assange and a generally credible source, says as much, claiming that he has even met the leaker and that it was, again, a &quot;Washington insider&quot;:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.craigmurray.org.uk/archives/2016/12/cias-absence-conviction/">https://www.craigmurray.org.uk/archives/2016/12/cias-absence-conviction/</a></p>

<p>As for the credibility of the CIA&#39;s recent claims? Consider this dose of skepticism from Glenn Greenwald:</p>

    <div class="md"><p>When faced with conflicting accounts, evaluate those accounts and how well they correspond to other known facts. And either, in theory, could be a lie. So are you suggesting that this poorly sourced story from the Washington Post and the CIA is more believable than the person who at least knows from whom he <em>directly</em> received the leak? Does the CIA and Washington Post have a better track record for honesty than Assange? I&#39;ve chosen my answer to that question, and I&#39;m pretty damn comfortable with it for now.</p>

<p>This would seem to be in our interest. I think there is a valid case for a non-interventionist US foreign policy. I don&#39;t think anyone is seriously suggesting that other countries should not be intervening in these cases, however. I&#39;d be perfectly happy to see us not be the world police. But large parts of the world still need policing, and <em>especially</em> after 2007-08 none of our allies are really in shape to beef up their military in short order. Europe is a clusterfuck right now. China and Russia are uneasy allies as are the US and China. It will take courage, intelligence, careful planning, diplomacy, and a good amount of time to remove us from the world stage in this fashion without completely demolishing the First World as we know it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>WARNING!  WALL OF TEXT INCOMING!</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Why do you think the USG starting a civil war would be &#39;suicidal&#39;?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Because if it actually comes to all-out war, it&#39;s not a war they can win.  If there&#39;s one thing Iraq and Afghanistan have taught us, it&#39;s that ragtag bands of goat-fuckers, armed only with AK-47s, IEDs, home-field advantage, and sheer fucking tenacity, can fight the world&#39;s most advanced military to a draw; all this on foreign land, where the people speak a different language and can be easily characterized as &quot;other&quot; (making it easier to convince US forces to kill them.)</p>

<p>On American soil, with Americans fighting Americans, the instant those orders go out, the Fedcoats lose a third to half of their enlisted forces and a smaller (but still significant) chunk of their officer corps to defection. (I am basing these numbers off of conversations I&#39;ve had with friends and family who are veterans; I admit that they are anecdotal, but they&#39;re not pulled straight from my ass.)</p>

<p>Cops are a different ball game, because they&#39;ve been trained to think with an &quot;us against them&quot; mentality.  The average cop, if ordered to, will mow down a group of people without a second thought.  A soldier, sailor, Marine, or airman <em>might</em> consider whether the order is lawful or not before pulling the trigger, which pretty much explains why</p>

<blockquote>
<p>the USG has been giving military hardware to our Law Enforcement organizations that&#39;s better than what our enlisted had in Iraq.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It&#39;s obvious how they&#39;re going to make their move.  They&#39;re going to take all the data the NSA has been gathering and come up with a list of people for the police to arrest and/or kill, in the hope that this will nip an incipient insurrection in the bud.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Your Federal government sees YOU as more of a threat to security than anyone in the middle east</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I doubt they see ME, personally, as a particularly grave threat.  They&#39;ve obviously collected a vast amount of data on me, just like they have everyone else, but I&#39;d be surprised if a human eye has ever looked at my file.  I&#39;m simply not important enough.  And this is a good thing, since it means I probably won&#39;t be in the first wave of disappearances.</p>

<p>Thing of it is, once that first wave goes down, the Fedcoats start losing hearts and minds <em>really</em> fucking quick, and in order to keep a lid on the situation, they would need to act with more speed, competence, and brutality than I think is within their capability (at least the first two).</p>

<p>They&#39;d probably be able to subdue the cities without too much trouble, but short of bombing the entire continent to smithereens, the Feds are not going to be able to crush a rebellion (or several disjointed ones) that&#39;s waging a guerrilla war from the countryside.  Too much territory to cover, too many veterans familiar with current counterinsurgency tactics, too many hunters who know the terrain like the back of their hand.  You know that misattributed Admiral Yamamoto quote about there being &quot;a rifle behind every blade of grass&quot;?  There you go.  They&#39;re not winning that kind of war, I don&#39;t think they can prevent it from becoming that kind of war, and I think they know it.</p>

<p>I haven&#39;t even touched the fact that a domestic insurrection in the United States would tank the global economy.  The banksters know this.  It&#39;s one thing if the insurrection pops off organically, but why on earth would they give the go-ahead for their goons to start a war themselves?</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>it&#39;s not a war they can win.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>They don&#39;t want to &quot;win&quot;. They want martial law. The civil war will be between brothers. Just like it always is. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>On American soil, with Americans fighting Americans, the instant those orders go out, the Fedcoats lose a third to half of their enlisted forces and a smaller (but still significant) chunk of their officer corps to defection. (I am basing these numbers off of conversations I&#39;ve had with friends and family who are veterans; I admit that they are anecdotal, but they&#39;re not pulled straight from my ass.)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Again, organizing an offensive isn&#39;t the point here. Creating mass chaos so moderate Americans beg for &quot;law and order&quot; is. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>It&#39;s obvious how they&#39;re going to make their move. They&#39;re going to take all the data the NSA has been gathering and come up with a list of people for the police to arrest and/or kill, in the hope that this will nip an incipient insurrection in the bud.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And they&#39;re probably going to use Blue Helms to do it, to avoid that problem with LEO&#39;s being too destructive and jarheads trying to protect us. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Thing of it is, once that first wave goes down, the Fedcoats start losing hearts and minds really fucking quick, and in order to keep a lid on the situation, they would need to act with more speed, competence, and brutality than I think is within their capability (at least the first two).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is why you have &#39;terrorists&#39; shoot up night clubs and schools. Just change &quot;muslim&quot; to &quot;conspiracy theorist&quot; and you can yank anyone off the street in the name of security. You&#39;re staring at the framework right now, they&#39;ve already built it. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>the Feds are not going to be able to crush a rebellion (or several disjointed ones) that&#39;s waging a guerrilla war from the countryside.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You don&#39;t have to crush the countryside. You wait for 2/3rds to die out from starvation, and then let the rest kill each other over resources while you sit nice and safe in DUMBs. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>I haven&#39;t even touched the fact that a domestic insurrection in the United States would tank the global economy. The banksters know this.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And they don&#39;t give a shit. The market correction is a mathematically inevitable event at this late date. That&#39;s why the bankers have been working hard to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIcqb9hHQ3E">extract</a> all the actual wealth (land, minerals, water) from their holdings as much as possible and secure it for themselves. Now, they&#39;re sending in the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-dsiufhMu0">jackals</a> in the form of Trump et. al. to get whatever crumbs are left while the American people wander around clueless in the streets chanting &quot;let&#39;s give him a chance&quot;. They know the economy is boned, they&#39;re prepared. Are you?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Rofl remember when Obama campaigned saying he would pull out troops out of Iraq and eventually the Middle East? Remember when drew that red line? Remember when nothing of the sort happened? Foreign policy is very similar between the two. Bush cut taxes for the rich and then Obama bailed em out and gave em raises when the market crashed. Both have completely ignored national debt. And health care, have you seen the massive spike in insurance rates under Obamacare recently? Do you&#39;re ally think he didn&#39;t see that coming? Funny how it was called the AFFORDABLE care act. Presidents today say what they have to to get elected and then go to the middle of the aisle. Both supported increased surveillance, both did nothing to change the situation in Guantanamo, both were in wall street&#39;s pocket. Both have done nothing pertaining to the war on drugs/private prisons/pharmaceutical companies. Obama is all talk. Your right about their differing views on homosexuality though. </p>

<p>I remember corporations given bailouts by Obama deciding on their own to give raises to their executives and being roundly condemned for it, even by Obama himself.</p>

<p>I remember Republicans admitting for a time that deficit spending was necessary to get the unemployment rate down. Then beginning, like you, to complain about the federal budget deficit. That&#39;s now going down. What do you think President Trump is going to do with the national debt and the federal deficit with his pledges to cut taxes, set the feds loose on illegal immigrants, explode the military budget and pass a trillion dollar infrastructure bill?

<p>Obama has had a Republican Congress all but 14 months of his terms. Yet he has been able to reform Federal drug policy in ways that cause people like Senator Sessions conniption fits.  Sessions is going to clamp down on marijuana sales in EVERY state, by the way.  That make you happy?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Okay, first off, the word &quot;hacked&quot; shouldn&#39;t really be used here. What should be used as an adjective instead is &quot;influenced&quot;. It&#39;s not debatable that Russia certainly wanted to influence the election, and anyone who doesn&#39;t understand the &#39;why&#39; of this isn&#39;t smart enough to even engage in conversation with. What is debatable is the extent of the influence. </p>

<p>Next, this issue goes beyond American politics and should be taken very seriously by both parties. The concern, at its core, has nothing to do with Hilary fucking Clinton or your lord and savior, Donald Trump, and this post proves exactly how ignorant people are. So congratulations by focusing on what really doesn&#39;t matter. Some of these people are fucking incorrigible. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This has everything to do with Hillary Clinton and her butt hurt supporters losing an election that they should have won. Instead of getting votes, though, they were too busy planning victory parties. The her magisterial drunkness couldn&#39;t even get her shit together to actually accept the results and lead her voters and followers.</p>

<p>Your whole argument rests upon the supposition that the American public is dumb and easily hoodwinked. That&#39;s the problem with Clinton dead enders, in that you have no respect for people who may have different opinions and feelings than you about the direction of the country. I don&#39;t agree with Trump and his ideas, but I didn&#39;t agree with Clinton either (mainly because I don&#39;t like two-faced hypocrites that try and make their hypocrisy and duplicity positive attributes).</p>

<p>And I say this as someone who is many standard deviations from the mean in terms of things you frankly aren&#39;t capable of understanding with your close-mindedness and intellectual bigotry. She and the system she represents got the comeuppance they deserve (well, they really deserve the gallows for the collective war crimes enabled by their cowardice, but whatevs). </p>

<p>I hope this Russian hyperventilation thing continues to erode public support for all neo-liberals and neo-cons, like John McCain and Lindsey Graham (and most assuredly Chelsea). Fuck the establishment, and if it is the Russians doing the fucking, I don&#39;t care. Your precious American ideals were sold out decades ago when we chose to invade a country for bullshit reasons (well, that and project paperclip giving Nazis a home in the USA after the war).</p>

For starters, <a href="https://www.dhs.gov/news/2016/10/07/joint-statement-department-homeland-security-and-office-director-national">this statement from the CIA, FBI, NSA, Army Intelligence and Security Command and pretty much every other US intelligence agency.</a></p>

<p>Outside of every US Intelligence agency, there is some corroboration from private security firms as well:</p>

<p><em>Threat researchers at Dell SecureWorks, an Atlanta-based security firm, had been tracking the Russian intelligence group for more than a year. In June, they reported that they had uncovered a critical tool in the Russian spy campaign. SecureWorks researchers found that the Russian hackers were using a popular link shortening service, called Bitly, to shorten malicious links they used to send targets fake Google login pages to bait them into submitting their email credentials.</em></p>

<p><em>The hackers made a critical error by leaving some of their Bitly accounts public, making it possible for SecureWorks to trace 9,000 of their links to nearly 4,000 Gmail accounts targeted between October 2015 and May 2016 with fake Google login pages and security alerts designed to trick users into turning over their passwords.</em></p>

<p><em>Among the list of targets were more than 100 email addresses associated with Hillary Clinton’s presidential campaign, including Mr. Podesta’s. By June, 20 staff members for the campaign had clicked on the short links sent by Russian spies. In June, SecureWorks disclosed that among those whose email accounts had been targeted were staff members who advised Mrs. Clinton on policy and managed her travel, communications and campaign finances.</em></p>

<p>1) What difference does it make that it was 100 out of 4,000 or 100 out of 40,000? Russian hackers targeted the Clinton campaign. That is the only point here.</p>

<p>2) What difference does it make if Trump&#39;s campaign was targeted? No information about him or his campaign was leaked. Had they been targeted and infiltrated it would bolster the case for Russia trying to meddle with the election since they would have kept whatever they found quiet. </p>

<p>3) Why do you believe that FBI, CIA, NSA, Army, Navy, Air Force, Marines and every other intelligence agency would lie about this? </p>

<p>I moved to the U.S. from Russia when I was a kid. I can tell you with certainty that they have absolutely no respect for the democratic process (United Russia routinely wins over 100% of the vote in many Oblasts and no one really gives a shit). Our Presidential elections mean something to me -- all of the political ads and partisan bullshit aside, it makes me proud to be a part of a country that truly has free elections (even if the rest of our political system is corrupt).

    <div class="md"><p>So they are automatically wrong about everything? While  it&#39;s certainly possible that the FBI might lie, it doesn&#39;t seem likely in this case. At least, their actions have not been consistent  with the notion that they were trying to get Clinton elected. If they were,  why would they re-open their investigation into her emails just days before the election?  And why would they sit on the information that Russia was actively trying to get Trump elected until <em>after</em> the election? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s difficult to say, because you&#39;re trying to measure something inherently subjective. </p>

<p>Either way, I think debating the content of all of these emails is somewhat beside the point. There&#39;s no denying the content and the picture they paint of Clinton being the career nepotist she is.</p>

<p>What I&#39;m personally more concerned with is whether people are willing to excuse a foreign power deliberately involving itself in our political process, especially if that power has a preferred outcome, just because they happen to support &quot;our guy&quot;.  If we&#39;re going to comb through every DNC email available, fine, transparency is good. But it needs to be balanced. Where are the RNC&#39;s emails? What do those show? I want to see everybody&#39;s dirty laundry, not just one sides.</p>

<p>Either way, we are doing ourselves a disservice if we willingly allow foreign involvement in our electoral process,  no matter who the beneficiary is. Russia doesn&#39;t do anything for the magnanimous benefit of the US, so we should certainly appreciate their motives when analyzing this situation.</p>

<p>Russia&#39;s involvement is hacking both political parties emails and deciding to sit on one and release the other. We have multiple agencies telling us this.  You&#39;re either saying it&#39;s no big deal, or that literally every one of these actors are in cahoots with one another to lie and pin the blame on Russia.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>In my mind, the public has a right to see those emails. While in a perfect world our benevolent public servants would be completely transparent, that&#39;s obviously not the reality. </p>

<p>Unfortunately we&#39;ll never know, but if the shoe were on the other foot, I highly doubt the same people shrieking about this would be doing the same thing. The whole &quot;integrity of our election&quot; thing just seems phony. Perhaps some people, such as yourself, have genuine concern, and that&#39;s fine, but I don&#39;t believe that&#39;s the case for a majority who say they are &quot;concerned&quot; about this.</p>

<p>Having said all this, there still isn&#39;t concrete proof this occurred. From my view this looks like a last ditch effort to discredit Trump and perhaps attempt to change the result before the EC votes -- the timing is just too convenient.</p>

What is paramount, in this specific example of &quot;Russian hacking,&quot; is the fact that all of these <em>revelations</em> are intended to delegitimize the incoming POTUS in the eyes of the US public and instill a hysterically negative view of Russia into anyone that is vulnerable to this persuasion.  As you would say- this is an example of an active campaign to influence the American public.. although, instead of Russia being the perpetrator, it turns out that the culprits are from the US and other Western nations.

<p>Here is a better writeup than I could have written. </p>

<p>The most relevant bits:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>To summarize, while yes we have no smoking gun, the methods used in the DNC hack are very similar to methods used by groups who are believed to have acted in the interest of the Russian government in the past. The hardest piece of evidence is that the DNC hack reused a command and control node and SSL certificate that were both used in a hack of the German government that german intelligence has linked to Russia.</p>

<p>Now we of course do not know exactly who is in these groups and whether they are directly part of Russian intelligence or just realted, but we do know that their actions align closely with Russian strategic interests. (hacking U.S. defense firms, hacking U.S. Government networks, hacking NATO allies). Crowdstrike, a respected cybersecurity firm, believes two Russian groups functioning independently of each other both hacked the DNC. Crowdstrike was of course hired by the DNC, but they are a respected firm with a good reputation. Two additional tech security firms hired by the DNC, Mandiant and Fidelis, confirmed Crowdstrikes conclusion.</p>

<p>The day after Crowdstrike released their report the Guccifer 2.0 wordpress account was created, claiming to be a lone hacker behind the hack. Though he claimed to be Romanian, he refused to speak at length in Romanian and spoke it poorly.. The meta-data in the first batch of leaked documents also indicates that they were edited by a computer using Russian language settings and who&#39;s username is a nickname for the founder of the Soviet Secret Police. After this was pointed out all subsequent leaks were edited using virtual machines with different languages and usernames from around the world.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t really want to go down this rabbit hole but,</p>

<p>A) High ranking seems like a big stretch here. The best I can gleam from wikipedia is that the man worked as a psychiatrist for the assistant secretary of state as an expert in hostage rescue. Impressive for sure, but even when he did work for the government that is not a position that would be involved with what he&#39;s claiming to do now. Certainly not remotely comparable to Vladimir Putin. </p>

<p>Just as a note, the deputy assistant secretary reports to the assistant secretary, who reports to the deputy secretary, who reports to the secretary. There are 35 assistant secretaries of state, who can have as many deputies as they want. At any given time there are probably 100+ people who shared his title. </p>

<p>B) For the last 30 years he&#39;s worked as a consultant and science fiction writer. There&#39;s no reason to think he would have access to this kind of information in the first place. </p>

<p>C) He hasn&#39;t provided any corroborating evidence, when doing so would be fairly easy. For instance, we know now that the attacks were done by the same computer involved in the &quot;fancy bear&quot; attacks on Germany. If he had simply mentioned this, then his claims could be verified, as that was not public information at the time. Even now, he could provide some kind of information on how he has access to this group, or any kind of verifiable information about this group. </p>

<p>All in all it seems overwhelmingly likely to me that he&#39;s saying most of this as a way to drive traffic to his youtube channel and website, where he sells his novels. </p>

<p>Obviously there is no way you could convict him of treason based solely on that youtube video. If the CIA found any evidence linking him to the hack he would likely be in jail right now. Seems like the fact that he&#39;s publicly admitting to treason and not in jail would imply that he might be lying. </p>

<p>Not to mention, the guy seems pretty far off his rocker. His most recent video is on the civil war being act of auto-genocide from Lincoln, committed because Lincoln was a homosexual. </p>

<p>You&#39;re getting downvoted because you&#39;re completely misinterpreting his statements (something a lot of people in this sub are good at). They are saying that a &quot;smoking gun&quot; is such a high bar to set, it&#39;s unreasonable to ask for it in cases like this. What are the chances that we would find a &quot;very high level communication&quot; that details their attacks and motives? You&#39;re asking for too much if you want a &quot;smoking gun&quot; in this case. The evidence we do have, however, does point to Russia&#39;s involvement.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Okay, so the former Deputy Assistant of the Department of State basically admits to treason so that he can sell a few books. I hope you see the problem with that logic. But if you want more evidence, how about a quote from a former U.K. ambassador in this <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/dec/10/cia-concludes-russia-interfered-to-help-trump-win-election-report?CMP=share_btn_tw">Guardian article</a>: </p>

<p>Craig Murray, the former UK ambassador to Uzbekistan, who is a close associate of Assange, called the CIA claims “bullshit”, adding: “They are absolutely making it up.”</p>

<p>“I know who leaked them,” Murray said. “I’ve met the person who leaked them, and they are certainly not Russian and it’s an insider. It’s a leak, not a hack; the two are different things.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Look, people make outlandish claims all the time. Don&#39;t you think the government would be trying to prosecute him if he really was the source of the leaks? Think about it. I can admit to murder with impunity. You know why? Because I&#39;ve never murdered anyone. You need evidence, not just a &quot;confession&quot; on a vlog, to make a case. There is no evidence this guy or his associates are behind the leaks. That&#39;s why he can comfortably admit to it without fear of prosecution.</p>

<p>And of course a &quot;close associate of Assange&quot; would claim that it wasn&#39;t the Russians. Again, we ask for actual evidence. Not just people who stand to gain from making unsubstantiated claims.</p>

<p>Interesting theory. Here&#39;s the difference between your theory and the theory that Russia was behind the attacks: the amount and quality of evidence.</p>

<p>On one hand, you have various security firms, Democrats and Republicans, and government agencies that agree that the evidence points Russia being behind the attacks. On the other hand, you have a guy with a vlog and a website that links to his book and Alex Jones at the very top. A man who directly stands to benefit from having people buy into his claims (book sales, video views, etc.). A man who risks virtually nothing to reap the benefits of making these claims. Learn to apply Occam&#39;s razor.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, a lot of people believed that Iraq had WMDs. But a lot of people believed they didn&#39;t. There was actual, real-life evidence that showed there weren&#39;t. I remember because I can admit I thought there <em>were</em> WMDs and I would argue with people who showed me evidence to the contrary. Looking back I learned to gauge what is solid evidence, as well as to always remember people self-interested motives. There is no hard evidence that points to anyone <em>other</em> than Russia being the source of the leaks. There&#39;s evidence and motives it was them. You&#39;re only evidence to the contrary is a couple people denying it was the Russians. People who stand to benefit from lying. People who offer no evidence of their own, even though they would be the ones who could most easily prove their claims.</p>

<p>Oh, and as far as your theory about why they don&#39;t go after Pieczenik, I could bring up Edward Snowden as a counter-example. The US aggressively pursued him, even though he had the support of a large portion of the public.</p>

<p>Edit:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>And you think a conspiracy between multiple organizations and people with conflicting motives is a <em>simpler</em> explanation than someone liking money?</p>

<p>Why are you so averse to believing this? I can get that you would hate Clinton/DNC or that you might think Trump is great. But Clinton&#39;s shittiness and/or Trumps greatness, and Russian interference are not mutually exclusive concepts. Is your confirmation bias so strong that you never change your mind?</p>

<p>Trump during the primary when he was taking down Jeb! for his brother&#39;s part in 9/11 makes sense for conspiracy to champion.  </p>

<p>But Trump now is a mess... </p>

<p>I think we can be both concerned with his Russian influences and despise Hillary&#39;s involvement in politics. Outside of the CIA&#39;s allegations, Trump has been friendly with people friendly to Russia and it seems weird the GOP (for the most part) is fine with that. It was just four years ago that Russia was considered our biggest geopolitical foe by Romney and now many Republicans don&#39;t want to talk about Russia or want to talk about Trump&#39;s potential cabinet picks with ties to Russia. </p>

<p>I thinkl earning why the Republicans are not as anti-Russia as they were four years ago would be interesting to say the least. Obviously the Dems are using this opportunity to scapegoat but there does seem to be something there.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Trump spews conspiracy theories left and right - I think he&#39;s creating or at least bolstering a relatively new breed of conspiracy theorist, a hyper-partisan variety that will not believe anything that goes against their prime directive, which I suspect in this case is not just Trump but the rise of a populist white nationalist movement. It is different in the level of cooperation and agreement that is emerging. In times past this particular type of propaganda has been effected through takeover of government run media and forceful shutdown of dissent. In the information age it&#39;s being done through targeted misinformation: complete discrediting of valid news sources that exhibit unavoidable editorial bias, selective acceptance of citizen journalism with no real sources or facts to back it up. It&#39;s like people joining a cult as opposed to a government takeover or coup: people self-select information sources and don&#39;t look at anything that contradicts their world view. So, there&#39;s some overlap with more traditional conspiracy theorists, but it has this other aspect to it that seems...novel.</p>

<p>Saying this you&#39;re implying that she should be ignored, also it is in line with the mainstream. You should also mention what is that so called present? Because I have no idea.</p>

<p>Don&#39;t question anything r/conspiracy , obey or you&#39;re supporting russia.</p>

<p>Ps- no one cared when top secret classified info was taken off secure government devices by <em>the secretary of state</em> and uploaded to an illegal unsecured server which was hacked by Russia, China, and multiple other sources... and now all of a sudden russia allegedly gave us TRUE information about THE SAME PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE LARGEST SECURITY BREACH IN HISTORY and there is an uproar?

<p>We&#39;ve stuck our nose where it doesn&#39;t belong far too often. Our foreign policy is a joke, we live in a constant state of war for oil and regime change, we have a history overthrowing democratically elected leaders to replace with dictatorships with western ties, and we&#39;ve been subverting international law for decades. </p>

<p>Our turn as the sole world power has seen abject destruction become the norm. Unipolarity is an insecure system because it allowed the US to be the world&#39;s playground bully. If you are frightened that Russia will take over if we lose our sole-superpower status don&#39;t, the are in economic shambles and can not take our spot. The move will likely be back to multipolarity in a Westphalian sense.</p>

<p>If you want to prove Putin is a terrible person use his LGBT treatment, economic cronyism and multiple blatant assassinations of political enemies. People will claim our leaders are just as bad but in these three aspects he stands alone.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks, I found <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/5hhn4t/cia_assessment_says_russia_was_trying_to_help/db0zali/">the other post with citations</a> and I note that it&#39;s mainly on the political positioning rather than the evidence of a proven connection between Russia and the hackers. The connection made by DNC-employed CrowdStrike endorsed with &quot;moderate confidence&quot; by SecureWorks is equally rebutted by Jeffrey Carr.</p>

<p>Seems very circumstantial. Imagining for a moment that the Russian state was involved however, I think there are two questions of interest to me:</p>

<p>1) Was this aimed at destabalizing the election, or the process as a whole?</p>

<p>2) Why not now release the RNC stuff (if anything exists)?</p>

<p>There&#39;s a legitimate chance that Russia hacked both parties&#39; servers, and leaked one party&#39;s info so that they could blackmail members of the other party post election. Sure, they didn&#39;t force the DNC to have shady shit on their servers, but if you think for a second the RNC doesn&#39;t have some secrets they don&#39;t want getting out you&#39;ve got to be insane. </p>

<p>The idea that this sub is laughing this off with &quot;Of course it&#39;s those crafty Ruskies again&quot; when the front page is 10 more articles with no new information on fucking pizzagate is actually sad. Hacks are sleeping on what could be one of the biggest conspiracies ever because it doesn&#39;t align with their partisanship. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I keep seeing this about Russian Hacks being the &quot;great conspiracy of our day&quot; but I&#39;ve yet to see anything that even suggests it. Some person supposedly with the CIA anonymously said Russia hacked the election, and only WAPO got it? We&#39;re taking about the geniuses leading the fake news witch hunt who used what equates to a fake news site as one of its sources. While I&#39;m in full agreement this Pizzagate shit is way overblown for being barely supported with evidence, but at least those people are working at something from a basis,  not just the marching call of a bad Media outlet. </p>

<p>If we are going to talk about the election, a better question isn&#39;t puttin, but Assange. Is he afraid of Clinton, did he strike a deal with Donald? Or is WL just publishing the only stuff it can get? </p>

<p>This post outlines the evidence that Russia is behind the hackings, the biggest pieces being that the hackers reused a SSL certificate from an earlier attack that Germany linked to Russia, and that 3 independent Cybersecurity firms all came to the conclusion that the attack was from Russia. The evidence here is pretty hard to argue against, and it seems like there is consensus among the experts. This was also covered by nearly every news source, not just WaPo. </p>

<p>The new information that was leaked was that Russia also hacked the RNC but chose not to release that info for whatever reason. This would imply that it wasn&#39;t just Russia trying to dig up whatever they could to make the U.S. look bad, but rather that they were specifically trying to swing the election. </p>

<p>There isn&#39;t as much &quot;hard evidence&quot; for this, the leak was just the other day and the CIA hasn&#39;t released a report yet. However, the fact that the CIA has yet to comment on the leaks is a good indicator that they are legitimate. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Definitely an interesting read. Now I&#39;m not a cyber expert, but the evidence relies on the fact that the Russians used a similar set of tools and servers as previous, but what prevents someone from intentionally leaving those tracks to get someone else blamed, I.e. increase tension between Russia and USA? Is there something built in that prevents this kind of fraud?</p>

<p>I hate to agree with Trump as well, but we are also dealing with a reality where a mountain of evidence can be perceived in a way to point to multiple conclusions (what appeared to be WMDs and Saddam bluffing,) and it&#39;s pretty important that something like this be correct this time. Additionally RNC chair claims there was no hack on RNC, aND FBI says there&#39;s no proof on it being Russians.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I see this evidence being flogged a lot. It attempts to impress with technically credible sources, but totally ignores basic facts of the interested parties in the situation.</p>

<p>Guccifer 1.0 was a real &quot;hacker&quot; and was arrested. Guccifer 2.0 was a false flag—and a ridiculous one. Does anyone remember the supposed Clinton Foundation leaks from Guccifer 2.0, with the &quot;Pay to Play&quot; folder? What credibility did it have? How damaging was it for the election? What was the value there? Yet this is being pumped up as the hack source? And its effect on the election was nothing next to that of the DNC and Podesta email leaks. The &quot;hacks&quot; you refer to are just theater to cover up for the fact that the DNC leaks and Podesta&#39;s emails come from insiders, not Russia. Oh, and to provide an alternate theory of the DNC leaks to cover for whacking Seth Rich.</p>

<p>So when the divided &quot;media collective&quot; is privately owned and caters to groups of people who are equally divided. That&#39;s terrible, the world has gone to shit.

<p>Furthermore, you&#39;re exaggerating the claim that every Western intelligence agency agrees on this. Many of them are claiming there is evidence of Russian interference, but they are divided on how conclusive this evidence is.</p>

<p>Finally, did we see any dissenting voices from the intelligence community when we invaded Iraq even though they doubted the existence of WMDs? No, because they were doing their job and couldn&#39;t disclose such information. Nonetheless, the people in power fabricated and exaggerated evidence to push a hidden agenda. The CIA is also known to have lied in the past in order to support the President&#39;s objectives. Why is it so difficult to remain skeptical until more facts come to light?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>First, you&#39;re being horribly unspecific. We are arguing about the source of the leaks. Specifically, the ones that had an impact on the election. That would be the DNC leaks and Podesta&#39;s emails.</p>

<p>You are claiming that Russians were responsible for hacking these systems and leaking the mail, and I am saying they did not. That is the truth in question here, upon which further deductions about various agendas might depend.</p>

<p>And my reasons for not believing your theory, I will provide by repeating what I told someone elsewhere:</p>

<p>For the DNC leaks, Assange all but bluntly states that it was leaked (not hacked) by Seth Rich:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kp7FkLBRpKg">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kp7FkLBRpKg</a></p>

<p>For Podesta&#39;s email, we don&#39;t have the name of the leaker, but in the Pilger interview, Assange says that the leak is from a &quot;Washington insider&quot;. Craig Murray, an associate of Assange and a generally credible source, says as much, claiming that he has even met the leaker and that it was, again, a &quot;Washington insider&quot;:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.craigmurray.org.uk/archives/2016/12/cias-absence-conviction/">https://www.craigmurray.org.uk/archives/2016/12/cias-absence-conviction/</a></p>

<p>As for the credibility of the CIA&#39;s recent claims, the ones you&#39;re basing your indignation about Russian meddling on? Consider this dose of skepticism from Glenn Greenwald:</p>

<p><a href="https://theintercept.com/2016/12/10/anonymous-leaks-to-the-washpost-about-the-cias-russia-beliefs-are-no-substitute-for-evidence/">https://theintercept.com/2016/12/10/anonymous-leaks-to-the-washpost-about-the-cias-russia-beliefs-are-no-substitute-for-evidence/</a></p>

<p>When faced with conflicting accounts, evaluate those accounts and how well they correspond to other known facts. And acknowledge that either account here, in theory, could be a lie. So are you suggesting that this poorly sourced story from the Washington Post and the CIA is more believable than the person who at least knows from whom he directly received the leak? Do the CIA and Washington Post have a better track record for honesty than Assange? I&#39;ve chosen my answer to that question, and I&#39;m pretty damn comfortable with it for now.</p>

<p>Then who did? What evidence do you have for that? Seriously, I&#39;m goign to lay out a case, with evidence, of why its the Russians. You should be able to do the same for whomever you think did it. Can you?</p>

<p>Are you aware that this is what Russia has been doing for decades now, going back to the Soviet Union? Interfering with elections is their MO. Sowing seeds of discontent using a &quot;fountain of lies&quot; propaganda is literally how they try and weaken their opponents. They recently did it in Ukraine. <em>We know this about them.</em> We also know they are mad at Obama and Clinton. Trumps statements make it clear that he is Russia&#39;s preferred leader. So given that you have to be naive to expect Russia not to try and do something just like this, like they do everywhere, <em>What are the Russians doing if not what is being reported?</em> Given the threat of the United State&#39;s to them, they&#39;d have to be crazy not to do this, wouldn&#39;t they?</p>

<p>Throw into this Trump&#39;s bizarre praise of Putin, Trump disregarding his own intelligence services and acting in public as if he had never heard the briefings, Trump&#39;s selections of very pro-Russian cabinet picks, <a href="https://twitter.com/keitholbermann/status/808066577715384320">Trump literally reading verbatim the words of Russian media propaganda</a> (I can&#39;t stand Obermann, but everything he says is publicly available, he just connects the dots). And that&#39;s not even all of it. The context is crystal clear to anyone willing to just spend some thinking about it. This is the conspiracy sub. Here is one that is literally laid out right in front of you. You don&#39;t even have to make any leaps of logic or faith. Its right there staring you in the face. </p>

<p>I&#39;m 46 years old. I lived through the end of the cold war where we always suspected there was a decent chance we&#39;d be incinerated in a nuclear war. Our enemy was the Soviets. They are now the Russians. Russians run the KGB playbook when it comes to foreign intelligence. Putin was a foreign intelligence KGB officer for 16 years. I am more scared of what is happening in my country than when I thought we&#39;d might be nuked. And most of my fear is that the people that I expect to be able to sniff this stuff out are completely blind to it. </p>

<p>Then who did? What evidence do you have for that? Seriously, I&#39;m goign to lay out a case, with evidence, of why its the Russians. You should be able to do the same for whomever you think did it. Can you?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Can you read? This question is answered in my post. I gave you direct quotes from the people accepting the leaked documents, and I explained why I trust those sources more than this WaPo CIA article, so ... I guess re-read that?</p>

<p>I am aware that Russia has hacked US government targets on multiple occasions. I also believe it&#39;s likely that they have their own copies of the contents of Hillary&#39;s private email server, which I&#39;ve heard was nearly open to the world.</p>

<p>But after this point, you again want to argue in a very non-specific way, &quot;The Russians have hacked us.&quot; &quot;Putin is former KGB.&quot; A lot of your argument is simply based on anti-Russian prejudice. They aren&#39;t saints, but you&#39;re judging them by a double standard. They seek to protect national interests, as America does. I&#39;m neither American nor Russian, but I find your faith in the CIA troubling. Have you never visited this sub before? Anyway, you said you were going to give evidence. <em>Where is the evidence that Russia supplied the DNC and Podesta leaks, specifically?</em> Let&#39;s do <em>be specific</em> as I suggested in my previous comment.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You didn&#39;t address my question about evidence, but that&#39;s fine.</p>

<p>The <em>cui bono</em> test that you&#39;re referring to is an interesting starting point for understanding a potential conspiracy; it helps to determine whether it even makes sense. But it is not sufficient in itself to determine the nature of events, especially when interested parties have every incentive to cloak their true interests. &quot;Russians benefited from the election of Trump. Trump won the election. Therefore, Russians are responsible for getting him elected.&quot; This is fallacious reasoning. It ignores the much more important factions <em>within the US deep state</em> that clearly support Trump. In case you haven&#39;t noticed, Trump has most of the FBI, the MIC, and possibly the NSA in his corner; the CIA, or elements of it, is not. If you want to know why Hillary lost the election, I suggest you consider that your own deep state was not comfortable with the particular brand of criminality that Hillary represented. The Russians are not nearly as central to the election outcome as the media, who are still serving the array of interests that Hillary represented, want you to believe.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>And why does this matter exactly? Funny that Russia provides the transparency this fucking &quot;democracy&quot; would need in the first place. </p>

<p>Can you quantify how those emails vs. other factors influenced the election results? Why are you so sure Hillary would have won without the email leaks? </p>

<p>Also, let me remind you the importance of words and how fake news are generated and then pushed by these so called &quot;journalists&quot; circlejerking: Russia didn&#39;t &quot;hack&quot; the election. It hacked a private email server, which happens every day. Also, claiming that Russia had shit on the Republicans, which I don&#39;t doubt exist and somehow didn&#39;t publish those is a conspiracy theory in and itself.</p>

<p>All in all these circlejerking &quot;journalists&quot; who lost all their credibility during the campaign anways are trying WAY too hard to discredit Trump.</p>

<p>Now calling them out on this is considered &quot;pro-Trump&quot; somehow. I&#39;m not a huge Trump fan but I&#39;m a fan of unbiased political discussion, and it&#39;s actually pretty fucking clear which side is more unbiased nowadays, and which side has more media power and lies all the time, distorts news, reports fake news then never follow up (where are all those women who Trump supposedly &quot;raped&quot;), and so on.</p>

<p>Oh, you had low expectations for the sub, because it&#39;s pro-Trump?

And someone here gilded this shit?</p>

<p>Read the following for a little bit of grown up skepticism about the horseshit you&#39;re trying to pass off as &quot;a legitimate chance&quot;, despite the directly contradictory statements of Assange, the person who at the very least had direct contact with the leakers themselves.</p>

<p><a href="https://theintercept.com/2016/12/10/anonymous-leaks-to-the-washpost-about-the-cias-russia-beliefs-are-no-substitute-for-evidence/">https://theintercept.com/2016/12/10/anonymous-leaks-to-the-washpost-about-the-cias-russia-beliefs-are-no-substitute-for-evidence/</a></p>

<p>Oh, and since you have such faith in the sincerity of anonymous CIA sources in the government, maybe you can just accept this FBI report at face value, because, you know, the FBI is the agency principally involved in investigating allegations of domestic espionage.</p>

<p><a href="http://archive.is/og8wu">http://archive.is/og8wu</a></p>

<p><a href="http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/nationworld/politics/ct-russian-election-tampering-cia-fbi-20161210-story.html">http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/nationworld/politics/ct-russian-election-tampering-cia-fbi-20161210-story.html</a></p>

<p>Also, the testimony of Craig Murray, an associate of Assange:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.craigmurray.org.uk/archives/2016/12/cias-absence-conviction/">https://www.craigmurray.org.uk/archives/2016/12/cias-absence-conviction/</a></p>

<p>But no, over all the credibility of these sources, people in r/conspiracy, if they were rational by your lights, would accept the word of the WaPo as sock-puppeted by someone in the CIA. Sorry but no.</p>

<p>BTW: I&#39;ve seen your evidence referring to the Guccifer 2.0 hacks. Not buying it. See my direct response there.</p>

I really don&#39;t understand the basis of your second statement. Assuming they covered their tracks well enough to not leave anything incriminating, how exactly would that preclude them from being able to influence the election by releasing harmful information?

<p>Why do you believe every US intelligence agency has a reason to lie about this? And if you do take them at their word, then setting the  carelessness of Podesta and other DNC staffers aside, do you really have no issue with Russia doing this? Whether you supported Hillary or Trump, this is a global rival directly putting their finger in our Democratic process to their own calculated benefit. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m skeptical because I believe that the current administration is in control of those agencies to a large degree and they will say what they are told to say.  The DOJ has been completely corrupted and there is absolutely no argument about that.  It&#39;s not a far toss to think that the three letter agencies are much the same.  The higher ups are controlled by the Obama administration, and the Obama admin is out to get Trump.  So we have &quot;Russian hackers&quot;.  There are other sources who have said the leaks have been coming from internal whistle blowers.<br/>
I&#39;m skeptical of all of them.  I&#39;m not just going to go &quot;oh okay well some dude in a suit who works for an alphabet agency made some statement to some MSM outlet so it must be true!  Now I&#39;m going to go watch football and get fat eating wings!&quot;  Nope.
Also, &quot;strongly believe&quot; is not evidence.  It&#39;s propaganda.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Almost definitely true.
You gotta admit, it is really strange though... she&#39;s single-handedly responsible for the largest security breach in our country&#39;s history (yes, top secret classified info was hacked from her UNSECURED server by Russia, China, and other world powers) and most people don&#39;t give a shit at all. She gets a &quot;get out of jail free&quot; card after paying the wife of someone investigating her almost a million bucks and having her husband ex president meet with the head of the DOJ just before the trial, still no one cares. They don&#39;t care about that same security breach when she runs for President.... And now that she has lost, people are upset that russia may have hacked podesta&#39;s emails (whose password was &quot;password&quot; and revealed TRUE information about her and the people surrounding her, and their countless list of nefarious deeds...
I just... Can&#39;t wrap my head around it. I really can&#39;t.</p>

<p>The U.S. Intelligence Community (USIC) is confident that the Russian Government directed the recent compromises of e-mails from US persons and institutions, including from US political organizations. The recent disclosures of alleged hacked e-mails on sites like DCLeaks.com and WikiLeaks and by the Guccifer 2.0 online persona are consistent with the methods and motivations of Russian-directed efforts. These thefts and disclosures are intended to interfere with the US election process. Such activity is not new to Moscow—the Russians have used similar tactics and techniques across Europe and Eurasia, for example, to influence public opinion there. We believe, based on the scope and sensitivity of these efforts, that only Russia&#39;s senior-most officials could have authorized these activities.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t know how many times it must be repeated until the message sinks in. But -- &quot;Where is the evidence?&quot; -- Citation is needed, what we need is a source that suggests it&#39;s true, but there isn&#39;t.</p>

<p>I could tell you that I&#39;m sitting right next to Big Foot &amp; have no evidence to show as proof and you&#39;d still want people circulating this with no sources to cite other than my word for it.</p>

<p>Just like the claims that Hillary Clinton got 3 million Illegal Immigrant votes, I&#39;m not going to believe that bullshit until a source citing evidence presents itself -- but I will suggest that if it&#39;s true, Hillary Clinton not only lost the Popular vote by 1 million votes, she lost both the Popular &amp; Electoral. But again, I digress, there&#39;s no evidence to suggest that the allegation is true so, why must we buy in to an allegation about the possibility of Russia interfering with the election?</p>

<p>If Russia helped Trump win the election by interference, and that&#39;s some how an automatic disqualifier, then would you not say that Hillary Clinton is equally as disqualified because she had help with foreign aid? Hillary Clinton having foreign aid is actually a provable fact and has been exposed to be true that her campaign was influenced by foreign aid via Saudi Arabia&#39;s ties to the Clinton Foundation amongst others who payed into the Clinton Foundation in exchange for Government favors &amp; influences.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Depends on how long you&#39;ve been into Politics to know who Hillary Clinton was/is prior to the 2016 bid for presidency. I&#39;ve known about both of these people (Trump &amp; Clinton) since the 90&#39;s, Donald Trump has been very good at what he does (which is Entertaining, he&#39;s a very good actor), if you want to know who the real Donald Trump is, the real Donald Trump is the type of person who will hire someone for a job, and if that person doesn&#39;t do a good job then he will find someone who will do a good job &amp; hire them. Trump is the type of person, who if you give him a role to play, then he depict that role in a believable fashion. He played the &quot;Bad Guy&quot; on WWE once &amp; he depicted himself as a &quot;Bad Guy&quot; &amp; he was good at it, it was entertaining. So, if you give him the role to play President, he will depict himself as a President in a Presidential fashion (more than likely). To put it bluntly, Trump is a successful Con Artist. The only person making the claim that Trump is the perfect little lamb, a &quot;Virgin Mary&quot;, is people such as yourself who like to make it out like every argument in defense of Donald Trump is what you make it out to be.</p>

<p>Any thing critical of Donald Trump compared to Hillary, you know, the &quot;Literally Hitler&quot; slogan, based on nothing but perception  &amp; emotional projections. Didn&#39;t believe any of it. Racist, bigoted, hateful, sexist, xenophobe, homophobe, transphobe, Islamophobe, etc. These labels, the slandering, obviously doesn&#39;t work find something else such as a real argument &amp; articulate it in a way that doesn&#39;t accuse or accentuates or projects your opinionated spun narrative. Clinton on the other hand, people cited sources, laid out the facts, &amp; let the evidence speak for itself, it just happens the overwhelming majority who saw that evidence came to the same conclusion, where-as the big difference here between Donald Trump &amp; Hillary Clinton is actually pretty obvious. The consensus on Clinton was generally &amp; majority came to the same conclusion by individuals, and the conclusions about Trump were all over the place you couldn&#39;t pin them down, mostly because the definitions of all the slandering labels did not match up.</p>

<p>As far as I am concerned, I don&#39;t care whether the news is the so called &quot;lame stream media&quot; or google facts. I am a firm believer of innocent until proven guilty. As far as I am concerned about Trump, that too applies, despite the stench of Russian manipulation and the fact he openly has asked the Russians to interfere during his campaign.</p>

<p>What I find fucking hilarious about you lot here is that Clinton is guilty no matter what she does yet the Donald could be forgiven no matter the evidence. Trump is incapable of conspiracy it seems....</p>

I say that there&#39;s a lack of evidence and you say that I&#39;m denying the existence of evidence? Why? Where is the evidence, show me.</p>

<p>I actually saw the conference where Donald Trump spoke about encouraging Russia to &quot;hack&quot;, but again, I can&#39;t say that that, in and of itself, is evidence that Russia was involved in any hacks. WHERE is the evidence that they were? </p>

<p>Donald Trump is only guilty of saying stupid &amp; retarded things at this point.</p>

<p>Do you know what truth, facts, evidence, statistics, etc. are? Because that&#39;s what is missing here when you make your case in arguments against Donald Trump. Give me anything for citation. Don&#39;t just link me to an article, where all the article does is project an opinionated narrative, they make a claim, but fail to link a credible source for why they believe this or that or how &amp; why it&#39;s evidence of any thing.

<p>The U.S. Intelligence Community (USIC) is confident that the Russian Government directed the recent compromises of e-mails from US persons and institutions, including from US political organizations. The recent disclosures of alleged hacked e-mails on sites like DCLeaks.com and WikiLeaks and by the Guccifer 2.0 online persona are consistent with the methods and motivations of Russian-directed efforts. These thefts and disclosures are intended to interfere with the US election process. Such activity is not new to Moscow—the Russians have used similar tactics and techniques across Europe and Eurasia, for example, to influence public opinion there. We believe, based on the scope and sensitivity of these efforts, that only Russia&#39;s senior-most officials could have authorized these activities.</p>

<p>Independent evidence :</p>

<blockquote>
<p>So here is the deal - you are never likely to see hard proof. The amount of info CrowdStrike was allowed to release is already miles ahead of what almost any other similar forensic investigation is allowed to make public. I&#39;ve done a number of these for some very large entities, and the most I&#39;ve ever been allowed to say is &quot;we&#39;re investigating a potential incident&quot;. </p>

<p>I&#39;ve had incidents where I was all but positive who was responsible, but the FBI would not allow us to publicly attribute it because there was still a margin of doubt. If the NSA (and many other independent researchers) are willing to say &quot;Yes, this was Russia,&quot; you can bet your ass they have a mountain of evidence behind that.</p>

<p>CrowdStrike are some of the very best in the business and were the ones responding to the DNC hack. Here is the evidence they were cleared to provide publicly:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.crowdstrike.com/blog/bears-midst-intrusion-democratic-national-committee/">https://www.crowdstrike.com/blog/bears-midst-intrusion-democratic-national-committee/</a></p>

<p><a href="https://www.crowdstrike.com/blog/bear-hunting-tracking-cozybear-backdoors/">https://www.crowdstrike.com/blog/bear-hunting-tracking-cozybear-backdoors/</a></p>

<p>(Again, keep in mind there is nothing nefarious about not sharing these details publicly. You will find very few entities that suffered a hack willing to allow responders to make even this much public.)</p>

<p>Additionally there is a good deal of evidence (technical, social, and circumstantial) that Guccifer 2.0 is an identity created by the Russian intelligence services to keep eyes off of them.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.threatconnect.com/blog/guccifer-2-0-dnc-breach/">https://www.threatconnect.com/blog/guccifer-2-0-dnc-breach/</a></p>

<p><a href="https://www.threatconnect.com/blog/guccifer-2-all-roads-lead-russia/">https://www.threatconnect.com/blog/guccifer-2-all-roads-lead-russia/</a></p>

<p>Lastly, there is this report from SecureWorks:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.secureworks.com/research/threat-group-4127-targets-hillary-clinton-presidential-campaign">https://www.secureworks.com/research/threat-group-4127-targets-hillary-clinton-presidential-campaign</a></p>

<p>These are three highly respected, independent sources all arriving at the same conclusion. To date I have not been able to find any credible sources that have had access to the details of the cases that have come to any other conclusion. If every independent professional investigating the breaches comes to the same conclusion, you can be pretty certain the evidence is all but overwhelming - whether or not you are authorized to see it yourself. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>All of which are speculation, absolutely nothing to suggest that any of this is true with irrefutable evidence or sources cited.</p>

<p>We don&#39;t know who hacked the e-mails, some might even suggest (but no evidence to back this up) that the DNC staffer who suicide by shot to the back of the head, is the one who leaked the information, and for doing so, he was assassinated &amp; it was made to look like a mugging. Now, unless we can link evidence that suggest the DNC staffer was working as a Russian secret agent, I have to throw this out as a credible source to rely on whether he was a Russian spy or just a DNC staffer who didn&#39;t like where things was going -- or he committed suicide via shot to the back of the head for the shits &amp; giggles.</p>

<p>There is enough to speculate though that the reason a lot of sources remain anonymous is because there&#39;s a possible threat to their life being in danger should they out themselves. So, depending on the things that the public does not know because we&#39;re not privy with access to these kinds of information, I&#39;m afraid that all of this is going to be nothing but unconfirmed accusations. We can demand the Freedom of Information Act, but that only gets us so far and often times doesn&#39;t lead us to any answers that we&#39;re looking for, and only confirm what was already common knowledge or speculated to begin with.</p>

<p>If you woke up one morning to find your vehicle vandalized &amp; someone had left video &amp; photographic evidence as proof showing you who it was that did it, are you going to move Heaven &amp; Earth to find out who it was that snitched, or are you going to press charges on the person who trashed your car?</p>

<p>There&#39;s a line to be drawn, of course, the question should never be &quot;where&quot; do we draw the line, but &quot;when&quot; do we draw the line. I&#39;m not interested in the truth? I think it was pretty clear that I want evidence &amp; sources cited that suggest it is true, what you gave me was a bunch of speculations &amp; accusations. Assertions, eh? Tell me, what assertion is strong enough to suggest that this is real, that Russia hacked our voting machines or influenced the election results? You do realize first &amp; foremost, the voting machines are not connected to the Internet, if someone was going to &quot;hack&quot; the voting machines, it&#39;s going to take some knowledge in engineering or reverse-engineering to physically tamper with the machines in person, and absolutely nobody is going to get away with something like that out in the open. if evidence exist that the voting machines was tampered with, please present a source citing this as fact. </p>

<p>If Russia influenced the election results, I have to disagree on the assertion based on not &quot;not&quot; being interested in the truth, but based on there being no strong credible evidence cited that suggests it is a proven irrefutable  fact. The only thing I could say Russia may be guilty of right now that has any merit to the idea that Russia interfered with the election results, it&#39;s when Putin announced &amp; said that a vote for Trump meant peace &amp; a vote for Clinton meant a WW3.</p>

<p>Again just to reiterate, if it&#39;s a disqualifier for a foreign Nation to aid a Presidential candidate on their campaign for Presidency, and if strong evidence that suggests Donald Trump is guilty of this, then would you also agree on the assertion that Hillary Clinton too should be equally disqualified for her ties to Saudi Arabia aiding her campaign amongst other foreign aid through favors &amp; influence being sold via the Clinton Foundation, which actually does have strong evidence to suggest that this is an irrefutably fact to be true? By the way, nobody is making the argument to say -- <em>&quot;so it&#39;s okay if Donald Trump/Republicans do it but if Hillary Clinton/Democrats do it it&#39;s not okay?&quot;</em> -- nobody is saying that.</p>

<p>Russian Support for Trump:</p>

<p>Trump’s behavior, however, has at times concerned the Russians, leading them to revise their hacking and disinformation strategy. For example, when Trump launched into an inexplicable attack on the parents of a Muslim-American soldier who died in combat, the Kremlin assumed the Republican nominee was showing himself psychologically unfit to be president and would be forced by his party to withdraw from the race. As a result, Moscow put its hacking campaign temporarily on hold, ending the distribution of documents until Trump stabilized, both personally and in the polls, according to reports.</p>

<p>FBI issued an unprecedented warning to state election officials urging them to be on the lookout for intrusions into their election systems and to take steps to upgrade security measures across the voting process, including voter registration, voter rolls and election-related websites. The confidential “flash” alert said investigators had detected attempts to penetrate election systems in several states.</p>

<p>Hacking of the Election Itself (Unconfirmed/Speculative):</p>

<p>...attackers would probe election offices in advance to find ways to break into computers. Closer to election, when it was clear from polling which states would have close margins, the attackers might spread malware into machines in some of these states, rigging machines to shift a few % of the vote to favor desired candidate. This malware would likely be designed to remain inactive during preelection tests, do its dirty business during election, then erase itself when polls close. A skilled attacker’s work might leave no visible signs though the country might be surprised when results in several close states were off from preelection polls.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sorry but I&#39;m gonna have to throw out a lot of those &quot;sources&quot; as most are biased left leaning or have just flat out been debunked already.</p>

<p>Don&#39;t cite any thing from NYT, r/politics , r/worldnews , USAToday, Forbes, Washington Post, The Federalist, New Yorker, Politico, News Week, Time, Reuters (any thing from Yahoo News is not credible source any more), Buzzfeed (especially Buzzfeed), CNN, The Guardian, The Hill, PBS, -- I have to throw out all of these immediately with out having to read them mostly because I&#39;ve already read them, and nothing they&#39;ve come out with was anything substantial as cited evidence that would suggest that Russia had any thing to do with the Election.</p>

<p>Don&#39;t need to list any thing from InfoWars, Breitbart or the famed &quot;Alt-Media&quot;, all of those don&#39;t list any facts, statistics, or evidence. I&#39;m a huge advocate for stating facts, evidence &amp; statistics, laying them all out there, and letting it speak for itself rather than someone giving me their opinion &amp; projecting the idea that it&#39;s real. I can&#39;t just have someone telling me what to believe because I&#39;m perfectly capable of critical thinking skills &amp; coming to a conclusion to form an opinion myself with out someone trying to force their narrative on me.</p>

<p>A lot of what you see in MSM today is nothing but an echo-chamber, which is just confirmation bias, which is you&#39;re not going to believe or trust any thing else if it&#39;s something that you already disagree with. I will take a look at a few of the there &quot;sources&quot; you cited though but don&#39;t be surprised if I don&#39;t just automatically believe &amp; agree with it 100%.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Like, for instance, the Haitians. The tsunami, earthquake disasters, etc. We were told for example that we were donating to help rebuild &amp; aid relief for the Haitians, yet there was no actual aid relief or rebuilding. Even the recent hit to Haiti, what I saw with my own eyes, were Haitians pleading with America NOT to donate to the same scam that they were exploited for. You know, there was something very telling about that, they were more concerned about Americans being scammed of these supposed &quot;Relief Efforts&quot;, than of their own predicament. So, I believe what my own eyes &amp; ears are telling me there.</p>

<p>Did Hillary Clinton vote in favor of going to war in Iraq, Afghanistan, Pakistan, etc?  My eyes &amp; ears are telling me yes, she did.</p>

<p>Did Donald Trump talk about grabbing a woman by the pussy? My eyes &amp; ears told me, yes. But did he actually do it? My eyes &amp; ears tell me, no, he didn&#39;t.</p>

<p>Is Donald Trump guilty of the Trump University scandal? Well let&#39;s see, money in the bank accounts, police reports, lawsuits filed, etc. My eyes &amp; ears are telling me, yes. And were these things settled in a court? Eyes &amp; ears are telling me, yes.</p>

<p>So, if you&#39;ve got evidence to cite that would suggest that Russia is responsible for any thing about this election, it better be something that my eyes &amp; ears actually believe.</p>

<p>I&#39;m all for skepticism when it comes to attribution, but when several of the top cybersecurity firms, and the NSA come out and say &quot;it was Russia&quot;, I think we can accept that it&#39;s true.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Question, if it&#39;s true that Russia did hack e-mails, influence the election in some way, etc. Is that at all possibly an indication, that Clintons private e-mail servers (the deleted e-mails) were... &quot;not secure&quot;? Just curious, because if there&#39;s any evidence that would lead to or link Russia to being even remotely involved, then wouldn&#39;t it be possible that the evidence is some where in at least one of those deleted e-mails?</p>

<p>Just interesting to think about, can&#39;t really say for sure though.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>None of the Wikileaks or guciffer leaks were from Clinton&#39;s server. </p>

<p>The leaks were podesta /dnc emails. Clinton&#39;s emails were obtained through foi requests. </p>

<p>Russia likely hacked the RNC too, as I linked above. The question really is not IF Russia hacked, it&#39;s why they hacked both and only released the dems emails. </p>

<p>And that is why this stinks of foreign meddling. </p>

<p>Time will tell, I only hope Obamas report comes soon I believe he wants it for Jan 20th.</p>

<p>It looks more like propaganda to spin a narrative to me. I mean, I see claims that two Russian agencies are involved but doesn&#39;t link a source that proves the connections exist, I can only say that they are wild claims at the moment, because with out a source showing a connection, it&#39;s more like walking right off a cliff or running a dead end.</p>

<p>Guccifer 2.0, sounds more like a convenient scapegoat to spin a narrative, no physical body it&#39;s more like a persona, or &quot;Anonymous&quot; at this point, someone innocent is likely dead right now but we&#39;ll never know because he couldn&#39;t make it to a trial.</p>

<p>One lone hacker trying to take claim of responsibility for the hack but it sounds more like a troll, don&#39;t even know who this person is and can&#39;t even tell if the claims can be substantiated, much less be a link proving any connection was Russia.</p>

<p>So, it seems like the only connection to Russia here, is apparently the &quot;lone hacker&quot; Guccifer 2.0 used a VPN to mask his real location by using a Russian IP address or proxy, and this is some how projected as evidence that Russia is involved?.. I don&#39;t see the connection of strong suggestion that Russia is to blame. </p>

<p>I think I need to give my brain a rest after reading all of that, most of it sounded like the author of these articles didn&#39;t even know what the hell he/she was talking about. It sounds like gullible people read those posts, and are going around projecting their opinionated spun narrative to say that it&#39;s factual evidence of Russia involvement, while at the same time lacking a source evidence to cite the connections with nothing but wild speculation.</p>

<p>Thing is, it does. </p>

<p>By the way, I don&#39;t agree with your assertions on the content of the DNC leaks. There is no evidence of pay to play like you say. </p>

<p>There is mounting evidence a foreign power meddled in a US election by selectively leaking emails from the democratic side. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>for all the people preaching how Russia did everyone a service by making information public, it&#39;s now being asserted that they also hacked the RNC but deliberately chose to withhold their data.</p>

<p>They based that conclusion, in part, on another finding — which they say was also reached with high confidence — that the Russians hacked the Republican National Committee’s computer systems in addition to their attacks on Democratic organizations, but did not release whatever information they gleaned from the Republican networks.</p>

<p>Personally I&#39;m done with all that... Trump won, move on, crybabies. I&#39;m a little more concerned with his cabinet appointments going to family, Wall Street, oil execs, intelligence people employed by foreign governments, etc. Then there was the lack of blind trust or divestment of his numerous business interests. &quot;I&#39;ll let my kids run it and we won&#39;t talk about it.&quot; I guess I have to take the man at his word, since he&#39;s kept all his campaign promises so far.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Craig Murray, Former UK Ambassador to Uzbekistan: The CIA’s Absence of Conviction</p>

<p>I have watched incredulous as the CIA’s blatant lie has grown and grown as a media story – blatant because the CIA has made no attempt whatsoever to substantiate it. There is no Russian involvement in the leaks of emails showing Clinton’s corruption. Yes this rubbish has been the lead today in the Washington Post in the US and the Guardian here, and was the lead item on the BBC main news. I suspect it is leading the American broadcasts also.</p>

<p>A little simple logic demolishes the CIA’s claims. The CIA claim they “know the individuals” involved. Yet under Obama the USA has been absolutely ruthless in its persecution of whistleblowers, and its pursuit of foreign hackers through extradition. We are supposed to believe that in the most vital instance imaginable, an attempt by a foreign power to destabilise a US election, even though the CIA knows who the individuals are, nobody is going to be arrested or extradited, or (if in Russia) made subject to yet more banking and other restrictions against Russian individuals? Plainly it stinks. The anonymous source claims of “We know who it was, it was the Russians” are beneath contempt.</p>

<p>As Julian Assange has made crystal clear, the leaks did not come from the Russians. As I have explained countless times, they are not hacks, they are insider leaks – there is a major difference between the two. And it should be said again and again, that if Hillary Clinton had not connived with the DNC to fix the primary schedule to disadvantage Bernie, if she had not received advance notice of live debate questions to use against Bernie, if she had not accepted massive donations to the Clinton foundation and family members in return for foreign policy influence, if she had not failed to distance herself from some very weird and troubling people, then none of this would have happened. </p>

<p>Clinton and her posse has been COMPLETELY NEGLIGENT WITH CYBER SECURITY THE ENTIRE TIME. Hillary removed classified info off of a secure government server and put it on her private, illegal, unsecured server where our TOP LEVEL CLASSIFIED INFO WAS HACKED AT LEAST 5 TIMES. </p>

<p>EVERYONE CRYING RUSSIA NOW, STFU!!!
if you cared about our nations integrity, hillary should have been put in fucking jail for that. If she had, she never would have run and no one would have been able to release that shit on her to impact an election. Case. Fucking. Closed. Stfu.</p>

<p>P.s. Podestas password to his email was &quot;password&quot;. But yeah... &quot;the hacks really seem similar to hacks russia has done in the past&quot;. 
Hmmm... maybe people with top level security clearance should give a shit about that responsibility and not invite anyone with a keyboard to spy on our secrets.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, and no. Trump had every MSM outlet (even fox at first) out to bring him down and make him look back, hollywood was against him, the fucking president who should have been doing his job was out campaigning for her every day, anyone that wanted to vote was called racist, deplorable, redneck, etc. Everything in the book. Clinton had the media absolutely covering her ass at every turn. They never mentioned anything damning in wikileaks that came out, they never mentioned any of her scandals ever, they never did anything but make trump look worse than he is (not he&#39;s great, but  if you looked at his policies instead of believing what msm tried to spew, there&#39;s a lot of reasonable stuff..</p>

<p>Not defending Trump, but Hillary and co. pulled out every trick in their playbook to paint him as much worse than he is. They&#39;re still doing it now, and we should all pay very close attention to what happens up until he is sworn in and during his term (s) of presidency.</p>

<p>the act of one country using rumour and misinformation to influence global politics is literally hundreds of years old. So although the US government and media is acting by impressively butt hurt, it&#39;s not a new or particularly dramatic for them.   </p>

<p>It would not take long to produce a list of elections around the world that were targeted by the CIA and in some notable cases, where they could not influence a vote, they planned a hit on the president.</p>

<p>So, perhaps more in keeping with the old spirit of this sub - we ought to be asking how this narrative of Russians influence started in the MSM back in September (in Time and CNN ) and now have magically come true - or so the CIA tell us .</p>

I remember watching the towers burn and finally collapse from across the bay. Our entire school was on the 5th story roof of our high school watching before they sent us home. Prior to 9/11 the media and government were yelling about Iraq this, wmds, chemical weapons. Act I : blame Iraq. Act II : 9/11 attack. Now take that anyway you&#39;d like, I for one feel it was allowed to happen. Act III : War.   We&#39;re in the same process now. Russia Russia Russia even during the elections. What could be staged for act II. It needs to be terrible, something so horrific and massive that the entire world instantly jumps into conflict. I shudder to say hydrogen. Act III : end game, there are no winners in a war between nuclear super powers. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I literally could not give a fuck about Hillary&#39;s emails. I believe the story I&#39;ve been told by Hillary and the media because it makes sense. A lot more sense the her secretly being some mind of mastermind out to grab power at any cost for reasons that aren&#39;t clear to me.</p>

<p>She doesn&#39;t know how to use any phone others than a blackberry from the mid 2000s. She doesn&#39;t know how to use the internet let alone how it works. She is in her 70s and has spent the last 20 years, the years that technology and the internet became everyday, in a protected bubble of the White House and constant high pressure work. The server was already in her basement because her husbands staff used it and it was recommended to her by Colin Powell. She asked him what he did about email and he brought up the idea of a private email. </p>

<p>Honestly tell me which story makes more sense. Busy women with zero technical skills who only knows how to use one phone insists her staff figure out a way to let her keep using that phone or us government state department use as a front for powerful political family to trade vast sums of money  and influence for favors and manipulate the whole system?</p>

Seems like the fact that he&#39;s publicly admitting to treason and not in jail would imply that he might be lying. </p>

<p>Not to mention, the guy seems pretty far off his rocker. His most recent video is on the civil war being act of auto-genocide from Lincoln, committed because Lincoln was a homosexual. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>First, you&#39;re being horribly unspecific. We are arguing about the source of the leaks. Specifically, the ones that had an impact on the election. That would be the DNC leaks and Podesta&#39;s emails.</p>

<p>You are claiming that Russians were responsible for hacking these systems and leaking the mail, and I am saying they did not. That is the truth in question here, upon which further deductions about various agendas might depend.</p>

<p>And my reasons for not believing your theory, I will provide by repeating what I told someone elsewhere:</p>

<p>For the DNC leaks, Assange all but bluntly states that it was leaked (not hacked) by Seth Rich:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kp7FkLBRpKg">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kp7FkLBRpKg</a></p>

<p>For Podesta&#39;s email, we don&#39;t have the name of the leaker, but in the Pilger interview, Assange says that the leak is from a &quot;Washington insider&quot;. Craig Murray, an associate of Assange and a generally credible source, says as much, claiming that he has even met the leaker and that it was, again, a &quot;Washington insider&quot;:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.craigmurray.org.uk/archives/2016/12/cias-absence-conviction/">https://www.craigmurray.org.uk/archives/2016/12/cias-absence-conviction/</a></p>

<p>As for the credibility of the CIA&#39;s recent claims, the ones you&#39;re basing your indignation about Russian meddling on? Consider this dose of skepticism from Glenn Greenwald:</p>

<p><a href="https://theintercept.com/2016/12/10/anonymous-leaks-to-the-washpost-about-the-cias-russia-beliefs-are-no-substitute-for-evidence/">https://theintercept.com/2016/12/10/anonymous-leaks-to-the-washpost-about-the-cias-russia-beliefs-are-no-substitute-for-evidence/</a></p>

<p>When faced with conflicting accounts, evaluate those accounts and how well they correspond to other known facts. And acknowledge that either account here, in theory, could be a lie. So are you suggesting that this poorly sourced story from the Washington Post and the CIA is more believable than the person who at least knows from whom he directly received the leak? Do the CIA and Washington Post have a better track record for honesty than Assange? I&#39;ve chosen my answer to that question, and I&#39;m pretty damn comfortable with it for now.</p>

<p>This would seem to be in our interest. I think there is a valid case for a non-interventionist US foreign policy. I don&#39;t think anyone is seriously suggesting that other countries should not be intervening in these cases, however. I&#39;d be perfectly happy to see us not be the world police. But large parts of the world still need policing, and <em>especially</em> after 2007-08 none of our allies are really in shape to beef up their military in short order. Europe is a clusterfuck right now. China and Russia are uneasy allies as are the US and China. It will take courage, intelligence, careful planning, diplomacy, and a good amount of time to remove us from the world stage in this fashion without completely demolishing the First World as we know it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, I think part of the issue is the framing in how you seem to think &quot;news&quot; works.</p>

<p>It&#39;s not the job of news programs to run a story like &quot;Why Hillary lost the election&quot; because that is primarily an opinion piece. Discussions like that happen on the &quot;talking head&quot; shows and in op-ed articles in papers. </p>

<p>It is news, however, to report on Russian hacking or Trump skipping intel briefings. Because those are in fact, news. It doesn&#39;t mean Russia was to blame, but the discussion about throughout DC is a news-worthy item.</p>

<p>So if you primarily just tune into your local nightly news program, I wouldn&#39;t expect you to see it. But if you turn on any of the cable news networks, there have been no shortage of those discussions. </p>
