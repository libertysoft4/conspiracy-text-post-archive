    <div class="md"><p>It really seems to me like &quot;fake news&quot; is &quot;conspiracy theorist 2.0&quot;. The Fake News writer they point to in the MSM says he started writing fake news critical of the democrats to show how stupid the alt-right folks are. If I was in there place I would hire a fake news writer as well in order to have a scapegoat if undesirable material got out.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The term &quot;conspiracy theorist&quot; did not originate with the CIA. The Oxford English Dictionary has a citation from 1964 and there are a few earlier on Google Books. I&#39;ve verified ones from <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=vlBTAAAAYAAJ&amp;amp;q=%22conspiracy+theorist%22&amp;amp;dq=%22conspiracy+theorist%22&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;sa=X&amp;amp;ved=0ahUKEwihtuKD7efQAhWmwFQKHURmCVkQ6AEIJDAC">1956</a> and <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=BRowAAAAIAAJ&amp;amp;q=%22conspiracy+theorist%22&amp;amp;dq=%22conspiracy+theorist%22&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;sa=X&amp;amp;ved=0ahUKEwihtuKD7efQAhWmwFQKHURmCVkQ6AEIHDAA">1962</a>.</p>

<p>The term &quot;conspiracy theory&quot; (as opposed to &quot;theorist&quot;) goes back to the 1800s.</p>

<p>A transcript of the 1967 CIA document: <a href="http://www.jfklancer.com/CIA.html">http://www.jfklancer.com/CIA.html</a></p>

<p>The document uses the term &quot;conspiracy theorist&quot; as a matter-of-fact description, not as a propaganda term. It uses that term one time and the term &quot;critics&quot; ten times. It does not attack them as crazy. You can certainly argue with the arguments they make, but they are rational arguments.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>While the term &quot;conspiracy theorist&quot; was used infrequently before 1967, the CIA brought the term into fashion in 1967. </p>

<p>The document isn&#39;t making arguments, rational or otherwise, it&#39;s outlining a strategy. </p>

<p>While the document doesn&#39;t attack conspiracy theorists as crazy it outlines an organized strategy to discredit those people that theorize conspiracies regarding the JFK assassination. </p>

<p>It wasn&#39;t the document that demonized conspiracy theorists it was the implementation of the anti-conspiracy theorist strategy that did. </p>

<p>There is a portion of society that will question the official narrative if they are free to do so, and there is a portion of society that will accept the official narrative. By utilizing this anti conspiracy  strategy they effectively pitted those factions of society against each other.       </p>

<p>Side note: You say the document makes rational arguments. The only rational for advocating &quot;To employ propaganda assets to and refute the attacks of the critics&quot; is that the official story is a lie, right?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Propaganda assets can disseminate true or false information. Originally the word &quot;propaganda&quot; didn&#39;t have a negative connotation. It just meant an organized effort to <em>propagate</em> information or a viewpoint.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve also never seen evidence that the CIA &quot;brought the term into fashion&quot;. It could well be, but I haven&#39;t seen anything on it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>To quote Lance deHaven-Smith, Florida State University professor and author of &#39;Conspiracy Theory in America&#39; </p>

<p>&quot;In 1967, the CIA had a memo about using “conspiracy theorist” term to discredit questioners of the Warren Commission. In the 45 years before the CIA memo came out, the phrase appeared in WaPo and NYT only 50 times(Once a Year). In the 45 years after, the phrase appeared 2,630 times (Once a week)&quot;</p>

<p>I&#39;m my opinion that isn&#39;t coincidence, and constitutes the CIA bringing the term into fashion. </p>

<p>I feel like we are discussing semantics, what are you thoughts on the strategy of the MSM to blast the &quot;False News narrative&quot; all of a sudden? </p>

<p>In a cultural context, someone who believes everything they read online is an idiot. That context implies a common sense that incorrect information or &quot;False News&quot; is, and has always been, common online.</p>

<p>There must be a reason to name it &quot;False News&quot; and &quot;Propagate&quot; that information at this moment in time.    </p>
