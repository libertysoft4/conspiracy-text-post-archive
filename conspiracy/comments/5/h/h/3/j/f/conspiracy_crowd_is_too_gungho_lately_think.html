    <div class="md"><p>Think rationally? Did you just call Donald Trump that stupid name that all the &quot;superiors&quot; like Jon Oliver started? </p>

<p>Piece of advice. Lose the arrogance.. take a step back. Prepare yourself. Your not ready for what they have. Whatever you think Trump is going to do or the policies he said he is going to put in place is irrelevant. To save America and to save the World. There is only one thing that must be done. Congress and press won&#39;t be needed. They are scared because honestly maybe they didn&#39;t want it to get to this point. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Trump. Real estate mogul of nyc. There was another real estate mogul once of NYc. Trump was actually in his building telling these elites that he was  never like you and he loves the American people. This other real estate mogul was the richest man on earth, richest American man! He was a threat and was killed in the first false flag. It also killed teslas wonders he wanted to bring to us cause this man was teslas friend. The others they have set themselves up in our high offices and taken our wealth, prosperity, innovations, and intelligence. Everything they have done is illegal it is null and void. Their assets, properties, and debt needs to be seized immediately. </p>

<p>They are a criminal cartel and are pagan minded occult scourge. They need to be eradicated from the earth to free mankind, all they have for power is the transmission of fear and no doubt. The belief they hold something worth value. The Vatican leads them all they pay penance. He is the God of them. They hold on their staff the pinecone which symbolized the human penal gland which is calcified and rendered useless from the time your a child because fluoride completely encases it and it&#39;s in your water, beer, soda, and even some foods. They have endless resources and endless remorse to kill and bribe all to serve their purpose to pass laws so we are incarcerated and overcome with corporations so large they make all your foods and drugs. You will never own anything fully if you do not participate. Your laws are made so harsh for safety and environmental and insurance and taxes so that the ingenuity of Americans that first invented these are now made and sold in communist countries where your dollars are spent to further human suffering of Chinese workers to save money. The very inventions made in America no longer support American liberty freedom but are sold to your very face for a price that goes to support the very thing we stand against. </p>

<p>Our soldiers go to war to fight countries to instill foreign entities to further this plan and not create freedom but destruction, poverty, suffering, and death. Your education is is from your country is a debt and it gives you a diploma to work for companies that are always looking to squeeze out income from any class but the rich. </p>

<p>Donald Trump is no nwo, your one of their fools. All he needs is that office and a communication line to you to explain that these entities day 1 will be seized and desist. Irs fed Dea fda
No more oil from places that execute people for belief, gender, or religion. We will not support the lively hoods of such evil. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Do you understand that your very soul was made as collateral for debt. That they go around the world and live lavishly increasing your debt to achieve absolute wickedness? The past 4 years we have killed so many people in shitty ass countries for freedom but it was only to instill a institution of bondage. They are the original masons who with slaves made the biggest and mysterious masonry megalithic structures in the desert that sits on your green god in your pocket and says new.world order. </p>

<p>They are pedophiles, pagans, occult, their power is comes from you believing what they gave you is valuable and that you&#39;ll spend your entire life to get it just to survive and maybe even burn your fellow man to get it. This belief in their worthless magik gives them unmeasurable wealth and power to control all things to siphon off your property, your assets, your land, your children&#39;s namesake. You buy their products which give you disease then go to the hospital to buy the pills that kill your soul and keep your emotion low. Any plants that maybe once people would ingest for therapy and cure disease are made illegal of the highest order and you will even strip freedom from your fellow man lock him away for a law that is non-lawful. These entities, their assets, their power, is by law of the original America null and void and to participate is to further the torture of the very kids that go missing around the world to be dominated and tortured. It is the domination of innocence the demonic possession of ruling over millions with a magic wand while they do and make you everything</p>

That works for me, there is only one way to make America great again and the world, it must be done asap. He must remain clueless and stupid seeming so that they don&#39;t drop nuclear sacrifice on us they must believe he is manageable and corruptable. These merchants of doubt who make anyone wealthy who is willing to fool their fellow man into ignorance and destruction deserve hell fire for eternity for what they have done. They are vessels of demons. No exorcist needed which is booming cause the Roman Catholic Church pays billions every year to settle their own ministers pedophilia. They own the gold which was once the value behind our money, now we sell any gold we find to get their belief money. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Do you even realize that your life is spent chasing something that you believe holds value. That people lose their property and homes because of the very occult idol that is used to buy all of everything anyone ever built or had so that mankind can suffer. Your income is taxed only by submission not by the law of your forebears the law of YOUR land which now holds millions of homes built by people who built them. The freedom of liberty that created so many things like cars, airplanes, computers, and products made in garages by Americans is now owned completely and made in places where people hang themselves cause they are slaves. Made in China by a people who dare not speak out or dare not dissent or face execution. The great cities that shined with glory are turned into hell holes of hatred and sorrow. </p>

<p>They are the pharaohs of old. We build them their temples and cater their wishes to acquire useless paper that holds the images of our forefathers who fought and died to escape it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>At birth when they take your footprint it is a symbol of bondage. Social security is identifying you as colateral for the debt you owe. The world is 292 trillion in debt and if you make 50k a year 98% of the world is poorer than you. That you must pay a Portion of your labor to a foreign entity that sends most of it to the source the central to pay for the interest you owe on the money you printed in your buildings and told what value it holds. </p>

<p>Trump is the messenger. There was a boy that came from the woods of America that had no education but he read lots of books and believed that God is in control. This man was told he could never defeat the Democrats it was impossible and this lowly man freed the black people from bondage with a document. Then shot in the head for opposing this group which controls the green idol in our pocket that men kill for. It&#39;s a 5 pull it out sometime and look at him. He was one of few that come along to ensure the last place of freedom and liberty should not perish from the earth</p>

<p>Trump is gonna tell you he&#39;s lowering taxes and gonna fight isis and build a wall and make great deals and bring back jobs. That sounds great to the weary but that&#39;s the ignora talking, that&#39;s the solution he&#39;s selling. Remember what he said? You don&#39;t tell your enemy your plan. You have to know that right now we are conquered and controlled by laws un constitutional. Your income tax goes to the fed which goes to london eventually to rome. But that is not real value it&#39;s only belief. They use it to take once American owned companies, private property. There is no need to for Congress or senators to abolish fraudulent unlawful institutions controlled by unelected foreign powers. Whatever debt you owe will be no more because you were loaned valueless and illegal notes. There are maybe a million homes empty in california from foreclosure which now the bank owns from the profit. Nice bank too Wells forgt</p>

We celebrate his rise from death but now we have a bunny and our children chase after eggs. Our children are celebrating a day meant for Jesus Christ and instead all they can think about are idols images of beasts and imaginary men who fly across the sky living in Antarctica. We celebrate the gift of his death now by going out on black friday fighting over televisions made in slave house nations. Televisions designed to hypnotize and channels filled with wealthy people that tell you what they want you to hear. Movies that teach so much like bad santa, bad moms, bad grandpas, go out and seek the flesh, get drunk and be stupid.

I don&#39;t think Clinton is above him, just another member of the same group pushing the same agendas. He&#39;s definitely pushing the same types of people she would have pushed anyway. As far as white hats, well, I imagine they would be fearful of going against the agenda of those pulling the strings.. There&#39;s no way they&#39;re not manipulating people behind the scenes to make sure their plans run smoothly. It is possible there are good people...

Unless the whole stage is coming down in 2017, which there are some good theories for. But if it is we will know soon and there was nothing we could have really done to stop it anyway.</p>

<p>This was 2.5 million votes, 74 in the electoral college.</p>

<p>Maybe it really was &quot;The Russians&quot;.</p>

And no it was not &quot;the Russians&quot;, it was any hacker with willingness to hack <a href="mailto:HDR22@clintonemail.com">HDR22@clintonemail.com</a> on an un-encrypted server when she traveled around the world using her blackberry.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Too much of this &quot;They&#39;re calling it fake news, we&#39;re obviously right&quot;. The fake news being discussed by the mainstream has become some sort of tinfoil vindication.</p>

<p>What&#39;s not part of their fake news is that Obama wants the election reviewed to see if the Russians were to blame.</p>

<p>They may simply be doing this for entertainment or to troll the masses.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Agreed. Please please please learn what the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KayBys8gaJY">burden of proof</a> is, how it works, and who holds it.</p>

<p>Also learn what <a href="http://www.logicalfallacies.info/">logical fallacies</a> are, how they work, and why they invalidate arguments.</p>

<p>And as I keep having to explain to the pizzagate guys, the expectation of evidence is kryptonite to claims that lack support. That&#39;s why the conspiracy falls flat.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Bill told him to run. It was obvious during the debates. The smirks, well-planned out one-liners, the whole joke about having her prosecuted. The alt-right will believe anything though. Trump could say, The Green Bay Packers are really from Hawaii &amp; they&#39;d believe that. </p>

<p>This is non-mainstream conspiracy though, so it rarely gets mentioned.</p>
