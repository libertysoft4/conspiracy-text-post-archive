Please, I&#39;m begging all of you, DO NOT ATTEMPT TO DO WHAT THESE GUYS DID. It&#39;s dangerous, probably illegal and will more than likely get you killed/detained by law enforcement. This will only add fuel to the fire and it potentially could lead to serious consequences for everyone here. If this sub becomes a hotbed of this kind of activity, the reddit admins will shit this sub down like they did with <a href="/r/pizzagate">/r/pizzagate</a>. This goes a step beyond doxxing and it becomes harassment and trespassing. I cannot in good faith watch this happen here and stay silent about it. For the love of god, please keep yourselves safe and out of trouble. We debated heavily about the merits of removing the post, but we ultimately decided against it because it goes against what we stand for as mods here. But I do not encourage these kinds of videos. I hope that you guys take this a seriously as I feel about it. Our future, all of our futures, depend on what we do right now. Don&#39;t mess it up for everyone by breaking the law or harassing/stalking anyone. Stay safe everyone.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I read your title as &quot;tunnel vision&quot;. I think it fits just as well.</p>

<p>Instead of harassing businesses I&#39;d suggest people start familiarizing themselves with the full history of the global conspiracy pizzagate is part of. It&#39;s just a tip of a monstrous iceberg that&#39;s been out in the open for centuries.</p>

<p>With a bit of background information they may be more likely to find the links between Jerry Sandusky, the British Royal family, the Korean human trafficking ring, child welfare organisations, and international aid organisations. I&#39;m sure the Vatican fits in there somewhere as well.</p>

<p>Edit:</p>

<p>Also.. the Israeli mafia was busted in Canada running a pedo ring..</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes exactly my point. The other mods were not thrilled with removing the post based on our anti-censorship policy. However I feel that this video violates the rules about stalking/harassment, but instead of here they are doing it IRL! That is even worse in my opinion.

<p>You know why that is possible?  Because we don&#39;t pick and choose what subjects people are allowed to post.  We moderate solely on the behavior conditions set within our rules.  The moment you break away from that tradition for the sake of the children or the protect the sub from danger, then you immediately alter the utility of the subreddit itself.</p>

<p>The sub isn&#39;t getting shut down because of the tunnel video.  The tunnel video wasn&#39;t doxxing anyone or breaking ToS.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>All the pizza gate stuff that is posted on here I saw on 4chan first, there&#39;s barely anything new being discovered, the things I&#39;ve learnt here are about other topics. This sub is getting bogged down with clickbait pizzagate threads and threads titled in a way to purely rev people up about the topic, with no real point. </p>

<p>I do support pizza gate stuff being posted here, but I think that the mods should perhaps get rid of some of the repeat/nonsense threads to clean the subreddit up a bit, otherwise it&#39;ll just become a different version of the_donald, where there were 10+ posts about the same tweet, or same news article, and threads/pictures that didn&#39;t mean anything were getting upvoted so much that the important things get lost. </p>

<p>edit: I had a look at the front page now and it looks a lot better than it has for the last week or so, so hopefully people aren&#39;t just upvoting blindly anymore.</p>

<p>They look at the ground as they go in then the video cuts to a text of them saying this isn&#39;t illegal then they show up in a dark setting and it goes to an underground area which DC is known to have underground areas</p>

<p>Their youtube sums up how they take advantage of current headlines to grab view counts for their ad revenue, you&#39;ve been trolled as have the admins who I suspect anyway are purposely pushing silly posts like this on <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> to make normies view conspiracies in general as silly.</p>

<p>I believe this is the most likely scenario. </p>

<p>Which is why i wouldn&#39;t bring it up. Ever. People love to talk and I&#39;m more than happy to listen with my hidden microphone. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>We should start a post and by posting saying something like we all agree not to go near Comet pizza or any other named businesses involved in conspiracies, or engage in any crimes.  Research and talking about is is NOT a crime.  If they passed legislation to outlaw sppech, it&#39;s invalid becasue it&#39;s unconstitutional.  Constitution has to be superceded by amendments, last I heard. Oh also and the constitituon is invalid anyway because of the COG being active--so there are no laws.  Keep that in mind.  Still you don&#39;t want them to harass you because they have money, technology and the numbers.</p>

<p>Something as simple as an &#39;aye&#39; in the comments, we are consenting to a social contract that no one here on <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> will go anywhere near comet pizza or any of these places.</p>

<p>Just so that we have a kind of agreement that it&#39;s someone else doing this, and not us.</p>

<p>I think it&#39;s stupid to go anywhere near there after this--they&#39;d have your face on camera, so they can recognize you.  And if you really believe in this grand conspiracy, then you&#39;re putting your whole family, neighbors and community at great risk of stalking and possibly murdering everyone you know.</p>
