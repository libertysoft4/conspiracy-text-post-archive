    <div class="md"><p>I bring it up because flat earth does not align with flight paths and i think it has been a bullshit theory to undermine this sub.  I think pizzagate would be burried if it were real.  I also think there are areas we should focus on such as wtc7 and centralized banking.  Pizzagate makes the community vulnerable to poliical attacks because there is not enough evidence.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not the one coming in here trying to conflate flat earth with pizza gate and that we should be focusing on 9/11 truth. </p>

<p>A lot of the 9/11 truth movement is controlled, ae911 in particular. It&#39;s simply not realistic that the biggest opposition to the biggest act of treason hasn&#39;t been infiltrated by establishment assets. That&#39;s why I asked what 9/11 truth they were speaking about in particular. If they wanna get us to dismiss pizzagate and push nano-thermite then I&#39;m gonna be suspicious of them. OP tries to dismiss me by association with r/politics when i&#39;ve been contributing to this subreddit for many years under other handles.</p>

<p>I think the nuclear demolition is pretty compelling. I haven&#39;t looked into much Judy Wood&#39;s stuff but I don&#39;t dismiss it entirely. Tesla technology can scale to extremely powerful levels. The Hurricane off the coast of NY that day is quite interesting. I&#39;ve seen a fair selection of video evidence glitches which makes me also partial to a no plane, or military cessna to get a template for CGI to be rendered over. Think the astrological significance of the event and numerology is interesting too, particularly with reference to Pluto (god of underworld).</p>

<p>Now you...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Kek&#39;s E=mc<sup>2</sup></p>

<p>wasn&#39;t a portion of the pentagon investigating financial crimes when 9/11 happenened? if you were funneling money to terrorists and to mafias to faciliate child sexploitation and the control of the drug market, well, blowing up a building wouldn&#39;t seem like an issue.</p>

<p>i have no proof of my allegations, but looking at why things happen the way they do. most crimes are committed for financial reasons, for profit, and profit flows up.</p>

<p>to me, a bank faciliatating the laundering money from sex crimes and drug sales is the same as being apart of a criminal network  - a conspiracy, this is the grandest conspiracy theory</p>
