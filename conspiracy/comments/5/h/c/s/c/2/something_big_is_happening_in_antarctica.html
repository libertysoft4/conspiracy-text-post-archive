<p>3 years ago scientists discover pyramids in Antarctica</p>

<p>Nov 22 Dailymail posts about Kerry having possibly visited the pyramid</p>

<p>Buzz Aldrin goessto Antarctica, where he tweets the following before being promptly deleted.</p>

<p>He was then medically evacuated from the continent.</p>

<p>If the Agarthians are starting to come topside, or the US Navy is planting a string of nukes along the edge of the dome then, this connection to Buzz doent help.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sure, but I&#39;m of the mentality that 2012 was something else. Disinfo or otherwise. </p>

<p>Although, I did have a dream that night that was very strange. Abducted by aliens sort of dream, but I fought them off, but it seems they did do something to me. I don&#39;t claim to have been abducted or anything, it was just a dream, but it was one of the only dreams of its type I&#39;ve ever had and it happened on said night of the &quot;global shift&quot;.</p>

<p>Ra explains the way the cycles of the cosmos coincide with the cycles of humanity and souls evolution. Ra never said 2012 specifically but it was in the round about time which was mentioned. The end of the cycle does not appear to be abrupt, but takes many many years to happen. </p>

<p>If you can entertain that idea, maybe something did change that night. In my life I can use that date as a rough time of when I started to shift away from self destruction and towards awakening. Maybe its just a coincidence but I&#39;m not ruling anything    out.</p>

<p>Maybe your dream had something to do with this energy shift or maybe it didn&#39;t. </p>

<p>I believe we are on the cusp of major earth changes. In the cosmic sense the cusp may still not be in my lifetime. I have no way of knowing and it is a waste of my time to worry about it either way. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Reposted from: The Voice of Russia.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There are not pyramids in Antarctica, apart from some random ice bergs. </p>

<p><a href="https://owlcation.com/humanities/Debunking-the-Pyramids-of-Antarctica-myth">https://owlcation.com/humanities/Debunking-the-Pyramids-of-Antarctica-myth</a></p>

<p>The daily mail article is based on an unsourced YouTube video and admits there is no evidence :</p>

<blockquote>
<p>A strange theory claiming that there is a mysterious pyramid in the Antarctic has emerged.</p>

<p>Conspiracy theorists have posted a video on YouTube, in which they claim that US Secretary of State, John Kerry, visited Antarctica last week to visit an &#39;alien base&#39; within the pyramid.</p>

<p>The video suggests that the images have been taken from Google Earth, but it is unclear whether they have been edited</p>

<p>The Buzz Aldrin tweet seems to have been entirely fabricated though he was evacuated in a medical emergency.   </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Kerry did go to Antarctica which I thought was odd for an outgoing sec of state.</p>

<p>I would have thought he would have more important things to do in his final days than to personally visit a remote scientific outpost in the middle of nowhere?</p>

<p>And what made buzz lightyear want to fly out there when he was obviously not up to trip.Quite a traumatic journey for an elderly man.Was he driven by something? Was there something that he just had to see?</p>

<p>The Pryimid thing does seem base less propaganda, but to what ends?</p>

<p>When Kerry visited I speculated Russian military movements in Antarctica but Aldrin wouldn&#39;t really fit with this theory. </p>

<p>If he was in poor health, then why take a sick old man to Antarctica?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The funniest part of the rise of Russian and Macedonian fake news and rumor sites is that it attracts the dumbest of conspiracy nuts. Anyone interested in true conspiracies and not just ancient aliens, reptile people etc, is well aware of the mind games Russia likes to use to influence the global stage. Seriously this is like conspiracy101 which asks &quot;who stands to gain&quot;? Who stands to gain from circulating fake news stories that imply our government is out to get us or that they are evil? Russia wins any scenario in which it can cause unrest or distrust in the general public, that&#39;s why these fake stories are all coming from the same hosting area and not a domestic blog or news source. This stuff goes back to the Cold War when we used to just drop leaflets over soviet Russia showing how much better life in America was. And yet instead of this being talked about, people want to talk about aliens and Clinton being a secret pedophile. The real conspiracy isnt a blog post in the daily mail  about alien pyramids, it&#39;s  actually much more simple. It&#39;s that people are being influenced by online propaganda all the while thinking they are above that very propaganda. </p>

<p>Tldr; stop posting Russian and Macedonian fake shit </p>
