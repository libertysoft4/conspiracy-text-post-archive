        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>*Abortions are so cool and amazing. Nobody ever should question abortion, and if you do, you&#39;re an idiot. There are no emotional repercussions. Oh, look, another top post of <a href="/r/twoxchromosomes">/r/twoxchromosomes</a> glorifying abortion!</p>

<p>*You should have sex with anybody. Be sex positive! </p>

<p>*Women really aren&#39;t meant to be homemakers. Let&#39;s convince women that they should work two jobs to support their families...then they are really free!</p>

<p>*Women should never be treated as objects. Let me post on <a href="/r/gonewild">/r/gonewild</a> now, but don&#39;t you dare comment on me being attractive or else you&#39;re a creep!</p>

<p>*There&#39;s no more value to a woman than how many likes she gets on a selfie. That is so much more empowering than being a homemaker!</p>

<p>*Women are princesses and men must constantly cater to them.</p>

<p>*Real women have curves</p>

<p>*You can be pretty, but only that &quot;natural makeup look pretty.&quot; Don&#39;t you dare pretend you like makeup!!</p>

<p>*It&#39;s OK to hate men</p>

<p>*Women don&#39;t need men. Women don&#39;t need to fall into any gender roles whatsoever. Instead, let&#39;s have no purpose and finally feel free!!!</p>

<p>Ok, I&#39;m just being bitter tonight, but I feel I was lied to my entire life about gender roles, and what it means to be a woman.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not saying I disagree with all women&#39;s rights issues. Of course, there are valid issues and there are many women who suffer greatly just because they are women. </p>

<p>However, I&#39;m so tired of being told what to think and believe as a women, and if I don&#39;t fall into that paradigm, I&#39;m evil.</p>

<p>I feel the larger conspiracy is to break up family units (or the concept of family in general) and turn men and women against each other. Gender wars. Eventually we will not need mothers and fathers.</p>

<p>Either way, I&#39;m also tired of not fitting I with women. I&#39;m not saying this in a way to get attention from men, or try to be one of the &quot;bros.&quot; I seriously find it extremely difficult to relate to most women because I feel they are just complete products of an operation they couldn&#39;t even begin to understand. While this can be said about all people, I feel women are like robots in today&#39;s society. &quot;Oh, Ellen Degeneres says we should all support this issue. I better believe her! Now I better go shopping for more clothes to impress men, but let me make sure I post a feminist rant on Facebook about how no men appreciate my beauty because I&#39;m overweight!!&quot;</p>

<p>As for me, I really think that there is a value and purpose for gender roles, and there is a reason &#39;they&#39; are trying to do away with them. </p>

<p>This post is more of a rant than anything. I&#39;ve posted better posts about this topic that I&#39;ll link here in a moment.</p>

<p>I&#39;m tempted to write a similar post, &quot;what I learned as a young gay man&quot;:  be as promiscuous as possible, take zero responsibilities for your actions, aspire to the surface trappings of masculinity but eschew the real thing, etc.   </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, not sure what to add.  Gay male culture seems to be about pure hedonism and taking no responsibility for its consequences.  No interest in the health of the community outside the narrow bounds of your subculture.  Worship of narcissism.</p>

<p>It kind of dovetails with what you describe.  When I was younger and more naive, I thought the fictional character Carrie Bradshaw was based on a gay man (made into a woman just to gain wider audience appeal), but I now realize that women <em>do</em> sometimes behave exactly that way, and modern culture encourages more of that behavior.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t want to overgeneralize, not every gay man is like that, but it is the predominant theme within the culture.  I&#39;ve kind of dropped out from it.  My partner has a little bit more tolerance for it, but not much.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I find it funny you&#39;re saying this, because I was talking with a buddy (we were both raised to be men, by men, who were raised by WW2 survivors whose survival depended on being macho - my buddy&#39;s grandad drove trucks of nitroglycerin for the Nazis and said they did it smoking cigars and drinking brandy) and we both don&#39;t see other men as equals.</p>

<p>We were taught men self sacrifice until you die. So when I hear a guy say &quot;I just had to do something for myself&quot; I see a woman or a child. Me doing something &quot;for myself&quot; means fixing something for my own house or car, not I need to buy something worthless and materialistic.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t have a problem with homosexuality, I have a problem with the culture. You can be a man and fuck one too. Being flamboyant running around flying the rainbow flag as you make things more difficult for every gay person just trying to duck their head and get through life without a hassle. That I have a problem with, it&#39;s not manly. Your sexual preference doesn&#39;t change what you are, it&#39;s not an excuse to be a disgrace to your gender.</p>

<p>Through a buddy I&#39;ve met a couple gay iron workers, and goddamn were they manly. They were just men who happened to like other men. Anything a &quot;man&quot; would stereotypically like to do, they liked like most others. They just went home to their boy not girl friend.</p>

<p>I&#39;m never going to be able to call up a flamboyant gay and say &quot;I&#39;m installing a new staircase, get out here I need someone to hold it.&quot; It ain&#39;t happening, so I&#39;m never going to be friends with them because there&#39;ll never be a reciprocation of value. I&#39;ll do it for a woman, because I&#39;m supposed to be chivalrous and help. It also helps out when they tell my wife what a great husband she has. Dont think it works the same when a Hollywood stereotype gay man says it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I guess you&#39;re a sophisticated city slicker, right?</p>

<p>All I hear is a child. Self-sacrifice is a pillar of being a decent human being (charity work, doctors without borders, you know things that aren&#39;t solely in your own best interest but societies), but I&#39;m guessing you know nothing of that because you sound like a narcissist, but even that sounds too complimentary.</p>

<p>So you&#39;re weak because you seem to think any physical work means you instantly fall apart. You&#39;re a coward - oh no you&#39;re a big man because you wanna make fun of those in the military without even giving a shit as to why they joined. Which goes onto, you clearly think you&#39;re more important than anyone else and they&#39;re not worth you self-sacrificing for.</p>

<p>We can tell by your user name you like imaginary manly things, so what you&#39;re too much of a wuss in real life to actually do manly things?</p>

<p>Do I have anything to back it up? How about a psychology and sociology degrees, and I went into the trades to make money - and I make more than anyone I know in my age group, especially the ones I went to college with, most of whom work at walmart.</p>

<p>I can do just about every construction trade better than most - except structural concrete. I do work for people, and they&#39;re so impressed by the quality they ask what else I can do.</p>

<p>I bought my first house before I even had a credit card in my early twenties. I have a wife and two kids, two god children of my best friend.</p>

<p>What cultural indoctrination anyway? If I listened to what everyone was telling me to do I&#39;d have gone on to sit on my fat ass in an office job struggling to pay off my student debts, working until I&#39;m almost 40 before I even had a hope of buying a house or being able to afford starting a family.</p>

<p>You keep on deluding yourself. Please! That bullshit steering boys away from the trades has made them so fucking lucrative. If you have skills people just throw money at you.</p>

<p>Lmao maybe because you majored in fucking psych and sociology. Jesus christ, for someone who&#39;s trying so desperately to come across as manly, I honestly cannot think of a more feminine major. Hahahha oh my fucking god.</p>

<p>Sorry, I&#39;m the narcissist? Buying a house in some southern hick village isn&#39;t anything to be proud of bud. If you weren&#39;t so fucking stupid as to major in psych/sociology, literally one of the most oversaturated and low-paying fields known to man, you&#39;d probably be able to buy a castle in whatever backwater you live in, and you wouldn&#39;t be a hunchback at 45.</p>

<p>The trades are fine, but please stop deluding yourself into thinking they&#39;re superior or &quot;more manly&quot; than other fields, especially ones that require a college education. The trades wouldn&#39;t exist without an engineer behind it all, and they sure as fuck go to college.</p>

<p>And finally, remind yourself that I&#39;m not the one claiming to be some &quot;big man&quot;, that idiot is you. Which is so ironic given the fields you got your degrees in. It&#39;s clear you learned literally nothing from your time in college.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re trying to make fun of psychology as a feminine subject? Okay buddy. Sure thing! It has gender parity, but you&#39;re clearly sad enough to be looking for any way to try and get a rise out of me. And of course you&#39;re an expert of job market pays too. I mean naturally you must be.</p>

<p>Trades wouldn&#39;t exist without an engineer? Yeah... okay! So God first Created the Engineer, and then the Tradesman? Oh no, it was the other way. And nope. Never been on a residential site that had anything to do with an engineer. Architect sure. Design drawn by the home owner and passed by the building department, yup. But you&#39;re clearly the expert on everything.</p>

<p>And I live in Canada buddy, outside of Toronto. Yeah those house pricing bubbled backwaters of Canada&#39;s biggest city. You also might be interested I emigrated from the UK, and got fucked by the system like most tradesmen from other countries do.</p>

<p>In conclusion, you seem to be an expert on absolutely everything you delusionally claim. So you&#39;re a fucking troll. Have fun, you&#39;re boring.</p>

<p>Clearly you envisioned a testosterone-filled, ruggedly masculine life for yourself when you chose psychology as your major. Who the fuck are you trying to fool?

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;d argue a physically gendered man has no obligation to act manly, gay or straight. Masculinity is largely a social construct and no one should feel forced to comply with their gender&#39;s social norms. That said, people who act outside of gender norms should not expect to be accepted by everyone with open arms, just as they have a right to act flamboyant, I have the right to find it obnoxious. </p>

<p>I also don&#39;t think &quot;flamboyant gays&quot; are a disgrace to other men or gays. If you dont like that sort of behavior then dislike the individual for acting that way,  it should in no way be seen as an affront to men as a whole.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>People have the tendency to assume roles they&#39;re good at. Men are physically stronger than women, generally speaking of course, so they assumed the role of hunter, while women are capable of child rearing, the biggest factor here being the ability to breastfeed, and so they assumed that role. They started as roles motivated by necessity and ability. These days though, a woman is more than capable of assuming virtually any role traditionally done by a man, and visa versa. So the perpeturation of gender roles is more a cultural norm than something that actual benefits us as as species.</p>

<p>I guess what I&#39;m trying to say is that while you&#39;re right, gender roles have existed for most of human history, we&#39;ve reached the point technologically, and socially, where those roles no longer need to be rigid, and the only reason they are is because it&#39;s normal and we&#39;re used to it. A woman being weaker physically no longer matters because we&#39;ve domesticated animals, no one&#39;s wrestling a caribou for dinner. And with breast pumps and formula, a man is fully capable of child rearing. </p>

<p>In the end do what makes one happy, whether it fits with their gender&#39;s supposed place in society or not, as long as people aren&#39;t being parasites to society who gives and shit.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree. If I can remember correctly from over a decade ago back when I was getting a psychology degree; there was a tribe (from Papua New Guinea, or somewhere similar) where the females adopted our traditional masculine roles.</p>

<p>We don&#39;t have any obligation to be or do anything. My personal problem is disguising selfishness and shallowness as a subcultural or personal trait.</p>

<p>If you only care about yourself, only yourself will care about you.</p>

<p>I have a problem with the flamboyancy because it&#39;s used as a mask to hide the truth, and it comes at the expense of others. Making a bad person.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well said.</p>

<p>And of course this can go in thousands of directions. With feminism, though, it&#39;s just infuriating.</p>

<p>The issues I do care about as a women are completely diminished by modern feminism.</p>

<p>One time I posted on one of the feminist subreddits: Shouldn&#39;t feminism be about something more than beauty? Doesn&#39;t that completely contradict itself when feminists focus on beauty?</p>

<p>Downvoted and sent hate messages.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, there are countries where women are treated like complete shit, and I think feminism is needed in that sense.</p>

<p>In addition, I think feminism should be more philosophical, debatable, and open-ended. I think too many women cling to views without really going deeply into them.</p>

<p>Feminism should not be an echo chamber of insecure women.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The divisive nature you mention is by design- subversion can be one of the most powerful weapons of war.  I think Sun Tzu is the earliest known person to have spread this idea (The Art of War) and that was over 2,000 years ago.</p>

<p>Subversion is predicated on the target population being unaware of the attempted influence on them, of course..  that is what I find to be the most frustrating with regard to <em>social issues</em> and the magnitude and frequency of conflicts that they so often entail.  We&#39;re all humans here- as long as you aren&#39;t hurting anyone else then keep on doing you.</p>

<p>Note:  While typing this, I thought of &quot;Join or Die&quot;- the famous newspaper cartoon in Colonial America from 1754.  It illustrated the importance of all of the different states coming together as one for the sake of the collective group.. I&#39;d find it hard to debate that this policy of unification didn&#39;t help those colonists back then and, with a little hope, I find solace in thinking that this policy will help us all, globally as it had helped those colonists in the past.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m going to tell you what you should think as a woman so brace yourself.</p>

<p>As a woman you should think as an individual.  That means that if you find yourself most comfortable in a traditional homemaker role, don&#39;t feel like you&#39;re letting down all these other women who want you to be something else.  It means that being a homemaker is not a nothing role, it&#39;s not a lowly role.  It&#39;s very different than being a top defense lawyer for the best firm in whatever city you&#39;re in, but it&#39;s not less than or greater than that.</p>

<p>Likewise, if you find yourself becoming that defense lawyer... Do it well.  Don&#39;t waste your time worrying about the haters.</p>

<p>What you&#39;ve come in conflict with is identity politics.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Women everywhere are going to celebrate when Hillary Clinton breaks that glass ceiling and a woman holds the highest office in the land.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Obviously that concept was proven wrong since Hillary didn&#39;t dominate the female vote.  But if they can talk you into putting yourself in a box labeled &quot;women&quot; then they can talk you into doing their bidding.</p>

<p>You&#39;re a woman! Great! But more importantly, you are an individual.  Whatever else you are, besides a woman, should be more important to you.  </p>

<p>I wish you the best of luck in life and I&#39;m happy you didn&#39;t voluntarily jump into that box.  Free range women are the best women.</p>

<p>Again I was just ranting. I just get so tired of it. It&#39;s so depressing.</p>

<p>Women have complained about not feeling valued, and then they spend their entire lives doing completely invaluable things.</p>

<p>By the way, I know men have plenty of the same issues (in different ways), but just feel that women are so caught up in this because it is cool to be a feminist and if you don&#39;t support modern feminism, well then, you must be evil.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not that I necessarily disagree with you, but what of taking a person in a coma off life support, who theoretically could recover <em>some</em> function but in all probability will be a vegetable the rest of their life, versus removing a fetus from it&#39;s mother (essentially life support) and letting it die because it&#39;s too young to survive, even with care? What is the difference</p>

<p>I realize that&#39;s not how abortions are done today, but in the abstract that&#39;s what it is, and it could be done that way if need be. Is there a difference between taking a life and not doing what is necessary to preserve one?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ll preface this by saying I have shared this fact a few times on here.  </p>

<p>Under Australian law, a foetus is a &#39;person&#39; once it becomes viable ie after 25 wks gestation. Before that there is no chance of it living outside the mother, therefore not considered a person.</p>

<p>This means that if you were, for instance, to physically assault a woman who was 26 wks pregnant and her baby died, you would be charged with murder as well as assault. If she was 23 wks pregnant, the law doesn&#39;t consider the baby a &#39;person&#39; and it would only be assault (likely grievous bodily harm). </p>

<p>Also, you can only have an abortion before 14wks, with that extended to 18 wks if you are high risk. You can only get an abortion after that if there is a life threatening situation for the mother or child.</p>

<p>Personally, I don&#39;t think that the moral issues this topic raises justify a blanket ban on abortion.</p>

<p>It&#39;s not for me personally, but who am I to make decisions for others? I&#39;m prolife in that I am a mother and value the life of my own children, but I&#39;m pro choice in that I believe that everyone has the right to choose what happens to them. </p>

<p>As humans we have come so far, I feel like making abortion illegal would be a giant step back in human rights. </p>

</blockquote>

<p>We attribute consciousness/sentience scores, on a gradient, to all living things. This is done on a subconscious level by everyone. Everyone&#39;s scoring criteria is different, but generally speaking an ant would be about a 3, a dog would be a 30, an adult human would be 97-100.</p>

<p>Let us assume for the sake of argument that an unborn fetus is generally about a 5. Considering the fetus is in a coma-like state throughout almost all of gestation, depending on how you define consciousness you could potentially even put it at a 1.</p>

<p>If this is acknowledged, is there much difference between killing an ant and killing a fetus?</p>

<p>Meanwhile, assume a born baby has a score of about 70. Autism is conscious-alerting, but even then the baby would likely be around a 50-60.</p>

<p>That is the difference.</p>

<p>Most pro-choice people attribute a low score to fetuses, and most pro-life people attribute a high score to them. Things could be complicated by discussions of potential for future life, but taking that argument to its core may require accepting that humans should produce as many children as possible (and many people do agree with this and implement this under certain consequentialist ethics systems).</p>

<p>So, excluding arguments purely from theistic belief, it really comes down to debate over the scientific interpretation of what consciousness and awareness and qualia and pain is, and where fetuses fall into this.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree with you 100% as a woman. :( I want to be a home-maker now, a gardener, a provider in my own way but society makes you think that those things are not valuable or useful. I used to think I wanted to go to college and get a high paying job, never have children, abortion was morally OK, but now... Im realizing what these things truly mean, being a woman. And yes it&#39;s ok for people to want this but honestly I don&#39;t think a college degree can even get you far. I&#39;d rather focus on family, and making things for myself.</p>

<p>They can&#39;t change what your heart finds valuable though. They can never change how you feel inside. I&#39;m re reading 1984 and it&#39;s making me wake up to all this separation of the sex. Divide and conquer, that&#39;s what the people in power are doing and it sickens me.</p>

<p>At this point I want to go buy property (also how dumb is that, we can&#39;t even go into the wild and live off the land anymore) and build my own home, garden, build furniture for it, etc. I know this sounds insane but living in an AMISH community sounds much better than what is expected of me at the moment</p>

<p>Edit: also I can&#39;t fucking stand twox or trollx anymore. I can&#39;t relate to women that well either. I just don&#39;t have the same values or thoughts and I feel like no one would get it either :/ they&#39;re all ideologues, only interested in how they can deem your beliefs partisan.

<p>Lol what? Welcome to civilization, you pay taxes. Feel free to move to the Congo and live in the forest there, I doubt anyone will bother you, but have fun not dying within days due to a myriad of factors.</p>

<p>You really should have gone to college, education is paramount and it&#39;d help alleviate how stupid you are. How do you expect to buy property when you&#39;re not even educated? You contribute NOTHING to society. Christ.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Partly yes, partly no I would say..  Obviously we live in a capitalistic (more or less) world where everything has a combination of intrinsic and extrinsic value.  Also true that education <em>generally</em> helps, though, I have many reservations about higher ed.

<p>I don&#39;t give a fuck if my words insulted op. They&#39;re fucking retarded if they honestly believe in whatever bullshit they&#39;re spewing.</p>

<p>And education is paramount. I can see some reservations over how some schools provide an easy place for sociology type folk to become kinda radicalized ( heavily preaching consent, abortion, etc), but college is still where the scientists, engineers, lawyers and mathematicians need to go, and society is nothing without people like that. </p>

<p>Ya, I agree with you regarding their views but you obviously aren&#39;t going to get much corroboration lashing out at someone here unless they&#39;re like fucking Hillary Clinton or someone equivalent.</p>

<p>Also agree about college.  My issue is that it is such a glutinous industry.  As well, I have noticed many people around me that performed very well in college but that lacked almost any ability to critically think.  Not so much with engineers as that is the crux of engineering but some people in the sciences I have found to be surprising simple minded.  Idk, it is what it is, I guess.</p>

I see her bounce back and forth between fighting/embracing her role as the homemaker, and myself as the bread winner. I can tell she wants to feel independent at times like she doesn&#39;t need me to survive, and then she&#39;ll come back thr next day thanking me for working so hard to provide for our family. The media plays a huge role on her attitude. Again: great post! </p>

Now I better go shopping for more clothes to impress men, but let me make sure I post a feminist rant on Facebook about how no men appreciate my beauty because I&#39;m overweight!!&quot;</p>

<p>One could say that society is in a &quot;zombie apocalypse&quot; in terms of consciousness. Women are more likely to stay within the norms and rules given to them and are less likely to deviate compared to men.</p>

<p>The other thing is that you have to think and find your own way and nobody else will or can help you. It is harder now because there are more choices, but you have to find what YOU want. For some, it is a high pressure job. For others it is a more traditional role as homemaker. Only you can decide what is best for you.</p>

<p>Women do have (or had) so much power in society, and it seems like the modern agenda has basically sought to remove it. Replacing it with dependency while claiming empowerment.</p>

<p>Beauty, femininity, compassion, nurture of children, creating a true home are all aspects of female power, but these have been disparaged and, horribly, outsourced into corporate hands.</p>

<p>It&#39;s really quite the pickle. So glad to hear you see through it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Okay I see what you&#39;re saying.  here&#39;s my interpretation.. one of the primary goals of feminism was to get rid of gender roles because they saw them as necessarily repressive and induced too much social policing.  you don&#39;t agree with that.  but the funny thing is you&#39;re using that same logic to critique feminism.  you&#39;re saying feminism is responsible for too much repressive social policing to watch ellen degeneras or whatever the fuck.. i can get behind this, but i disagree totally with your implied solution which seems to be to revert back to 1950s era gender roles. this gets us nowhere but a constant back and forth of imposing one set of roles and then the backlash imposing a new set next generation.  i think the elimination of repressive roles and social policing should be the goal-- sometimes that means calling out feminism and sometimes it means calling out traditional values...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think gender roles hold some value.</p>

<p>But I never said that we should go back to an Era of repression.</p>

<p>I think that we have destroyed roles so much that we have lost important family structures.</p>

<p>I think the goes deeper than this.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not advocating for regression or repression. I&#39;m saying that gender roles are influenced by undeniable biological sex differences. The complete elimination of gender roles was irresponsible.</p>

<p>We cannot ignore that there are differences between men and women, and those should shape some of our roles in society.</p>

<p>Have you heard about the controversy in STEM fields for example? Despite all this effort to push women into STEM, it just doesn&#39;t work. It has nothing to do with sexism. Women are biologically better suited in roles that have to do with people and humanities.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, one of the products of people doing whatever they want is the complete breakdown of family structure. How many dads are actually in their child&#39;s lives anymore? Is this a good thing?</p>

<p>With that being said, I&#39;m not calling for policing people. I&#39;m calling for elimination of propaganda that perpetuates a sole liberal feminist view of the world.</p>

<p>We are teaching children that their biological sex means nothing, and that gender roles are &quot;evil&quot;</p>

<p>At the same time, in the strangest twist, we are allowing 5 year Olds to choose their gender?!??! </p>

<p>Feminists hate gender roles, yet they believe a 5 year old boy can choose their gender because they might like to play with girly things.</p>

<p>It just feels completely upside down.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not all of us are that bad ;)</p>

<p>In the same way that young women are socialized in way that makes it hard to form meaningful relationships, or even interact with strangers in a friendly way, so are men, though differently. The whole MRA/red-pillers phenomenon is sort of a reaction to that, albeit misguided in my opinion. It gives them reason that their life didn&#39;t turn out how they thought it should, and puts that blame on women. It&#39;s terribly unhealthy because it puts them in a victim mentality, and when you&#39;re in one of those, they only thing you can do is lash out at those whom you perceive to have wronged you.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sounds kinda fakish, like something that one might read on an alt-dimension version of Jezebel. It has the same commercialized vibe/tone of magazines directed at younger woman with a &#39;progressive&#39; slant, the only difference being the negation of the &#39;progressive&#39; proclamations while retaining the same cookie cutter &quot;feminine&quot; feel. Perhaps the stereotypical tone was done as parody, who knows, in any case it came across as insincere, artificial, at the very least unprofound and generally uninteresting.</p>

<p>Scary isn&#39;t it? I&#39;ve found that a lot of my &quot;friends&quot; who claim to be so open minded about feminism and stuff are only that way as long as it pertains to their beliefs. Ugh.

I do believe that the elites have an ulterior motive in doing away with some traditionalist actions, but some aspects of traditionalism is a &quot;trap&quot; and full of shit.

    <div class="md"><p>Ironically, I actually agree with you on several of your points. Women should definitely think for themselves instead of going along with whatever popular notion society says. This is why I&#39;m against both extreme traditionalism and extreme liberalism. </p>

<p>If you have extra free time, research different forms of feminist thought. The things you describe in your post is more reminiscent of liberal feminism. Radical feminism, the school of thought I like the most, is refreshing. A lot of radical feminists are against porn, the hookup culture, sex positivism, and the trans takeover of female spaces. Of course, there are some major differences that don&#39;t mesh well with 100% your post, but it&#39;s nice for women to think for themselves.</p>

<p>But yes! Let&#39;s definitely talk more. Our conversations would be very interesting and educational. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t give a fuck if my words insulted op. They&#39;re fucking retarded if they honestly believe in whatever bullshit they&#39;re spewing.</p>
