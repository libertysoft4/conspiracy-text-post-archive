<p>Barack declared an official investigation before he leaves office</p>

<p>The CIA found evidence of Russia trying to boost trumps chances by providing wiki leaks with hacked emails</p>

<p>The Obama administration has known about it for months!</p>

<p>Trumps cabinet picks are crazy</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t know. The human brain was not designed for this. After thousands of years, it has only been in relatively recent history that the internet came about and became commonplace in western society. Our evolutionary process, however much of that you believe in, did not account for any of this. Being able to take tons of information from all over the entire planet, having so sift through all of it and rapidly try to keep up while also trying to distinguish what seems legit from what seems like BS, and then having to rapidly try to form theories and perceptions about the massive amount of information incoming. I know there are legit geniuses among us who probably feel that it&#39;s a cake walk, but for average people like myself it is exhausting and disorienting. I have no idea what is going to happen in the next year by itself, let alone the next few.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The people who claim to be geniuses and think they know exactly what is happening or what will happen, are lying.  If they knew, they would have their own radio show or be on tv.  We are all equally disoriented.  To be honest, i think the govt agencies and govt leaders are disoriented too.  Nobody knows whose a whistleblower, whose corrupt, and who is just doing their job.  </p>

<p>I would literally be willing to wager at this point that they are all looking at each other, genuinely shrugging and saying &quot;idk, is pizzagate real?  Do you know??&quot;</p>

<p>Its such a major cluster fuck.  And the fact that the media has been lying, or was dishonest for all this time, and now they got caught by the public - now the public widely doesn&#39;t believe the media, and the media doesn&#39;t know if the public is buying anything, and they are walking on eggshells so they aren&#39;t so obviously biased, yet still appealing to their overlords.</p>

<p>There have honestly been a few times where the elites seem to have been caught off guard, Hillary in particular, which leads me to think that mostly everybody is in a state of uncertainty as what will happen.  For all the govt knows, one little slip up and a vast majority of the public could rise up.  If one little shred of serious pizzagate evidence came out, that could be the dam break right there.</p>

<p>The most important thing isn&#39;t so much what they are doing; its what we are doing.  We should really be finding ways to unite the people so we are able to counter whatever does happen.  Pizzagate, even if it is a lie, is actually a great psyop that is causing people in large numbers to stand united against the govt, because its something we can all agree on.  Its also brilliant, because there are so many stories of govts planting CP on innocent whistleblowers so they could bust them.  Now, the table is flipped and the govt has CP on their hands, and it is very difficult to wash that accusation off</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think transhumanism is something to keep your eye on. If you&#39;re reading this, you may very well &quot;live&quot; hundreds of years. Worst case, your likeness and consciousness will be immortalized. Best case, medical technology hits its stride and we remain truly alive. </p>

<p>Newton (yes, controversial figure here) said we&#39;d be done by 2060. <a href="https://isaac-newton.org/statement-on-the-date-2060/">https://isaac-newton.org/statement-on-the-date-2060/</a></p>

<p>That&#39;s probably not too far off. </p>

<p>Behind all the Trump Clinton crap is a much more complex story taking place. A war fought between intelligence agencies. NSA became extremely powerful with the explosive growth of the Internet worldwide. </p>

<p>Trump wants to make our current NSA director, his future DNI (Director Natl Intel),  to whom all intelligence agencies report to (or so they pretend to.) </p>

<p><a href="http://www.wsj.com/articles/pentagon-intelligence-chiefs-push-to-oust-nsa-director-1479610439">http://www.wsj.com/articles/pentagon-intelligence-chiefs-push-to-oust-nsa-director-1479610439</a></p>

<p>The catch is, our current Sec Defense and DNI want him out. They also want to split up the NSA and Cyber Command, which is run by the same man currently, into two separate agencies - one being civilian and the other still a part of the military. </p>

<p>Remember, the CIA is &quot;civilian&quot;. The NSA is a part of the Navy. They are trying to castrate the NSA before Trump takes over. </p>

<p><a href="http://www.wsj.com/articles/ex-nsa-contractor-stole-at-least-500-million-pages-of-records-and-secrets-1476991747">http://www.wsj.com/articles/ex-nsa-contractor-stole-at-least-500-million-pages-of-records-and-secrets-1476991747</a></p>

<p>This is a huge story. Whatever the NSA is up to, it has some Intel agencies very worried. I&#39;d guess quantum computers. Take some time to read about why quantum computing will change the game.</p>

<p>That&#39;s all just domestic news that I&#39;ve found interesting. There is a lot going on and mobile reddit is limiting me. </p>

<p>Keep in mind there are people at the highest levels that are trying to bring about end times. Don&#39;t stress too much. These guys are all info junkies and none of them can tell you what will actually happen next. It&#39;s debilitating like any other addiction. Take a walk. Hang out with some trees. Enjoy what we have right now. Stay educated but don&#39;t get caught up in the emotional seige. Question everything. Stop lurking. </p>

<p>Go buy a card for your family, or just someone you like seeing on this Earth. </p>

<p>Edit- something something Bank for International Settlements. Financial world is waiting on the Fed to increase rates. It needs to happen. Just a question of when. Do they fuck Obama over or Trump? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>1) Business as usual - lies, creeping/ineffectual regulation, soft wars, political corruption, cyclical prosperity.</p>

<p>2) Wake up one day and world is on fire, hyperinflation, riots, infrastructure disruption, global calamity from comet, weather anomalies, geographical/planetary dysfunction.</p>

<p>3) New Age Dawn. freedom of expression and association, population stabilization, clean energy, basic needs being met globally.</p>

<p>4) New World Order. Police state, depopulation, identity and travel control. Rigid stratification of socioeconomic classes. Coerced religions, enforced thought and association.</p>

<p>Some or all of this? Somewhere in the midst lies the truth?</p>

<p>From the film &quot;Charly&quot;:</p>

<p>(Chemically induced experimental genius being asked questions...about his take on the future)</p>

<p>Convention speaker #5: Modern science.</p>

<p>Charly Gordon: Rampant technology, conscience by computer.</p>

<p>Convention speaker #1: Modern art.</p>

<p>Charly Gordon: Dispassionate draftsmen.</p>

<p>Convention speaker #4: Foreign policy.</p>

<p>Charly Gordon: Brave new weapons.
[laughter]</p>

<p>Convention speaker #1: Today&#39;s youth.</p>

<p>Charly Gordon: Joyless, guideless.</p>

<p>Convention speaker #6: Today&#39;s religion.</p>

<p>Charly Gordon: Preachment by popularity polls.</p>

<p>Convention speaker #3: Standard of living.</p>

<p>Charly Gordon: A TV in every room.</p>

<p>[laughter]
Convention speaker #4: Education.</p>

<p>Charly Gordon: [agitated] A TV in every room.
[more laughter]</p>

<p>Convention speaker #1: The world&#39;s future, Mr. Gordon.</p>

<p>Charly Gordon: Brave new hates, brave new bombs, brave new wars.</p>

<p>Convention speaker #7: The coming generation.</p>

<p>Charly Gordon: Test-tube conception, laboratory birth, TV education, brave new dreams, brave new hates, brave new wars; a beautifully purposeless process of society suicide.</p>

<p>[silence]</p>

<p>Charly Gordon: Any more questions?</p>

<p>(back to &quot;InTheseDays&quot;)</p>

<p>That being said, I have witnessed decades of false hope, wondrous invention, immeasurable broken promises, warnings of impending doom and genuine genuflections of hope for humankind.</p>

<p>TL;dr - <em>Who the hell knows?</em></p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>The CIA found evidence of Russia trying to boost trumps chances by providing wiki leaks with hacked emails</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No evidence of this whatsoever.  If you have it, please present.</p>

<p>We&#39;ve also heard &quot;Assange&quot; <em>is</em> CIA.   Next are we going to hear that Putin=CIA, that would be new.  Of course, yes, they are all on the same team though: MURDER, INC, the sevens.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Trumps cabinet picks are crazy; Wiki leaks, pizza gate, HRC, pedophilia; We are so divided as a country, history is repeating itself  </p>

<p>history is repeating itself</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That&#39;s their <del>fault.</del> success</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Corruption within the FBI, DEA, DNC, GOP. What&#39;s going to happen? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>They can give us Justice or they WILL get a repeat: of the French Revolution.  All the rich will flee, except instead of Malta, they&#39;ll have to go to antarctica because there&#39;s no where else that will have them because they&#39;ve made terrorism aroudn the world, and the world&#39;s full. That is what Antarctica is about. They are picking out condo units there under the ice, because they know they are superfucked.</p>

<p>That&#39;s why we need to pick out places to neutron bomb on antarctica, but wait till they finish the condos first (it leaves structures intact--the perfect capitalist nuke). This last part is a mean joke.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Seems to be headed in the right direction if you ask me. It&#39;s good that your average Joe is starting to realize that you shouldn&#39;t trust everything you hear.</p>

<p>The MSM is completely discredited. Next step is internet censorship which will fail. Ask yourself this: Why would anyone bother censoring &quot;fake news&quot; when the easier and more efficient option would be to provide concrete evidence against it? (unless that option isn&#39;t available) </p>

<p>Only the guilty would discredit accusations instead of providing proof of the contrary.</p>

<p>There are factions everywhere and the same goes for the global elite. Soon they&#39;ll start screwing each other over either in order to save their own skin or because they see this as an opportunity to get rid of the competition (see Trump). </p>

<p>The people aren&#39;t actually divided, it&#39;s just the ones in control scrambling in a desperate attempt to maintain it.</p>

<p>Tl;dr: Keep spreading the truth, more normies need to wake up. There&#39;s more of us so their only option is to stop us from working together.</p>
