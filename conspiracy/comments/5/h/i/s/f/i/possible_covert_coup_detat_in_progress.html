        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Think of what&#39;s been happening this last week.</p>

<p>The entire MSM starts talking about Fake News and the Russian propaganda connection. The Senate then passes a bill that establishes an agency for &quot;counter-propaganda&quot;. The house will soon vote on it and Obama will sign it.</p>

<p><a href="http://archive.is/BEA8j">http://archive.is/BEA8j</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senators Rob Portman (R-OH) and Chris Murphy (D-CT) today announced that their Countering Disinformation and Propaganda Act – legislation designed to help American allies counter foreign government propaganda from Russia, China, and other nations – has passed the Senate as part of the FY 2017 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) Conference Report. The bipartisan bill, which was introduced by Senators Portman and Murphy in March, will improve the ability of the United States to counter foreign propaganda and disinformation <strong>by establishing an interagency center housed at the State Department to coordinate and synchronize counter-propaganda efforts throughout the U.S. government. To support these efforts, the bill also creates a grant program for NGOs, think tanks, civil society and other experts outside government who are engaged in counter-propaganda related work.</strong> This will better leverage existing expertise and empower local communities to defend themselves from foreign manipulation.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Obama then orders a review of any &quot;election-related&quot; hacking done by Russia.
<a href="https://archive.fo/daV8o">https://archive.fo/daV8o</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Washington (CNN) — President Barack Obama has ordered a full review into hacking by the Russians designed to influence the 2016 election, White House Homeland Security and Counterterrorism Adviser Lisa Monaco said Friday.</p>

<p>&quot;The President has directed the Intelligence Community to conduct a full review of what happened during the 2016 election process. It is to capture lessons learned from that and to report to a range of stakeholders,&quot; she said at a Christian Science Monitor breakfast with reporters. &quot;This is consistent with the work that we did over the summer to engage Congress on the threats that we were seeing.&quot;</p>

<p>Monaco said the administration would be <strong>mindful of the consequences of revealing the results of their review publicly.</strong> All of the Democratic senators on the Senate Intelligence Committee have called on Obama to declassify intelligence on Russia&#39;s actions during the election.</p>

<p>&quot;You want to do so <strong>very attentive to not disclosing sources</strong> and methods that would impede our ability to identify and attribute malicious actors in the future,&quot; Monaco said of disclosure.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Then a source starts claiming Russia helped Trump purposely. <a href="http://archive.is/Y2445">http://archive.is/Y2445</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>The CIA has concluded in a secret assessment that Russia intervened in the 2016 election to help Donald Trump win the presidency, rather than just to undermine confidence in the U.S. electoral system, according to officials briefed on the matter.</p>

<p>Intelligence agencies have <strong>identified individuals</strong> with connections to the Russian government who provided WikiLeaks with thousands of hacked emails from the Democratic National Committee and others, including Hillary Clinton’s campaign chairman, according to U.S. officials. Those officials described the individuals as actors known to the intelligence community and part of a wider Russian operation to boost Trump and hurt Clinton’s chances.</p>

<p>“It is the assessment of the intelligence community that Russia’s goal here was to favor one candidate over the other, to help Trump get elected,” said a senior U.S. official briefed on an intelligence presentation made to U.S. senators. “That’s the consensus view.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Finally, keep in mind the DHS was <strong>CAUGHT</strong> probing the Georgia State network. <a href="http://archive.is/vKUOw">http://archive.is/vKUOw</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Georgia Secretary of State Brian Kemp has asked federal officials to explain what appears to be an attempt by the U.S. Homeland Security Department to breach the state’s voter registration database a week after the November election.</p>

<p>The claim comes after an IP address associated with the federal agency attempted to penetrate the state’s firewall Nov. 15. The attempt was unsuccessful, but in a letter Thursday to Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson, Kemp said he wanted to know whether the department had permission to conduct what he called an “unauthorized” scan of Georgia’s system.</p>

<p>“At no time has my office agreed to or permitted DHS to conduct penetration testing or security scans of our network,” Kemp said. “Moreover, your department has not contacted my office since this unsuccessful incident to alert us of any security event that would require testing or scanning of our network.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The way the narrative is flowing, I think Russia could be framed in some sort of hacking attempt on the voting machines to help Trump. Afterwards, the electors would be pushed to choose an alternative Republican such as Kaisich because of an &quot;on going investigation&quot;. Finally, when Congress meets the damning report would be released so they would choose that alternative Republican candidate because of &quot;Trump&#39;s ties to Russia&quot;. Remember, Obama wants the investigation done prior to January 20th.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.archives.gov/federal-register/electoral-college/roles.html#congress">https://www.archives.gov/federal-register/electoral-college/roles.html#congress</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>The Congress is scheduled to meet in joint session in the House of Representatives on January 6, 2017 to conduct the official tally of electoral votes.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Look carefully at Trump&#39;s response. &quot;These are the same people that said Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction. &quot; What do we know about this in hindsight. Well the CIA concluded that there were no WMD&#39;s, however the bureaucracy at the top used select CIA findings to establish a narrative that wasn&#39;t true to justify regime change. Does this sound familiar? Remember all the concern trolling about Trump going back on his promises before he is even inaugurated? What if that&#39;s just to make it more acceptable to us when the covert coup happens?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think OP is right about this theory.  They&#39;ve shown a willingness to try to recount (cast doubt on trumps win) with the idea that in 9 days they will again try to use bribed, threatened or blackmailed electors into &#39;faithless&#39; electors to &quot;re&quot;-win Hillary&#39;s presidency.</p>

<p>And if that fails, their backup plan will be to trump-up charges on Trump and Putin, saying that all the &quot;alt-right&quot; who were inculcated into &quot;russian propaganda&quot;  (ie: Corbett report and Alex JOnes...rofl!) and managed to sway the whole populace into voting for trump (well, voting AGAINST hillary).  Yeah...this fifth column had NOTHING to do with all that propaganda about like...Hillary dying and having parkinsons and such...That Russia pressed a button and hillary&#39;s robot chip glerched and she did the head fast blinky eye thing that totally wasn&#39;t just a seizure...and said, &#39;gleeerrrrrk did you try the COLD CHAI&quot;..  Damn you russia and your illegal hillarybot remote control</p>

<p>Nevermind that we <strong><em>all know about her crimes</em></strong>, we <em>all know she&#39;s a treasonous traitor</em>, and many of us know Obama is too; and now we&#39;re proving they have tight social and financial and political relationships with convicted pedophile murderer cannabals who kidnap children into a post MKULTRA type program to create manchurians and monarchs and probably the victims become abuser/handlers also in this massive multiplayer international crime ring going back decades.  </p>

<p>Lol where? To the bastion of freedom that is the UK? Or maybe to central Europe while it gets flooded with extremists posing a refugees? Or should I go to Australia or Japan, which are under US control. Maybe I should go to China were my online actions are monitored and compiled into a personal score? Or should I go to Africa (do I really need to say anything there?)? Or should I go to South America, where drug cartels behead people daily and economies are crashing so hard that their money is worthless? Or maybe India, where they just made a shitload of currency worthless?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Another interesting phenomenon are these &quot;look who I met&quot; selfies with Hillary. They seem obviously staged and the people who ran into her &quot;by chance&quot; have been later found to have had meetings with her in the past.

If you were scripting a constitutional crisis to engineer a subversion of Trump&#39;s ascension to the white house, this would be a nice little way of keeping your protagonist in the public mind until you&#39;re ready to make your move.

<p>The US Gov has mobilised the greatest fighting force since WW2 and parked it in the Pacific to counter Chinese power (John Pilger has written about this) and has greatly increased its military presence in the Baltics. It has attempted to overthrow Russias only Middle Eastern ally Syria, attempted a Soros/CIA coup in Ukraine and is attempting to build a missile defence shield (which is extremely dangerous) in Central Europe directed against Russia but using Iran as an excuse. This is dangerous because it removes Mutually Assured Destruction as a way to ensure peace. Once that sheild is in place the West can nuke Russia at will and suffer minimal (for a nuclear war) casualties and the Russians definitely know about it. The Americans are doing the same in South Korea, using North Korea as an excuse to implement a missile defence shield targeted against China.</p>

<p>In all of these things you notice it is the US that is the aggressor and yet if you were to take Western media at face value you&#39;d wrongly believe that it was Russia and China that are the aggressors.</p>

<p>Like using a thunderstorm to cover the sound of a gunshot, the powers that be are attempting to engage Russia and China in a war to fully utilise their populace control mechanisms and cover up their corruption that has led to the biggest financial collapse in human history. They do this because if the masses knew the reality they&#39;d revolt and start lynching former elites. That is why they are pushing for war with Russia, better to plunge the world into nuclear war than have your hidden power structure exposed.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>My guess is that the tptb, (NYC/London bankers seem to be main outward incarnation to peer at), do not have control over Putin. And they want Russia because it is a major focus of power with all it&#39;s resources. They hardly can/could stand Cuba, Venezuela, NK, Iran, Libya standing up to them and giving them the finger... So Russia, far more potentially a threat, if it can continue to be independent of their control will bother them to no end.<br/>
.<br/>
Seems they strive for complete, 100% control over everything for themselves. </p>

<p>I think this is the most important bit of information. Here we are talking about Russians hacking when our own government agency was caught. It&#39;s more likely that we are dealing with a cover up in regards to DHS or NSA activity during the elections.</p>

<p>Although it&#39;s just as likely that those in power are trying to link election shenanigans to Russia in order to lay the groundwork for retaliation in Syria since the rebels have been losing ground at an exponential pace since mid November. I&#39;d imagine the establishment doesn&#39;t want Russia to succeed over there no matter what it takes.</p>

<p>I think Trump using the example of the Iraq war wasn&#39;t a mistake. His advisers know full well that the US is intent on trying to fix the quagmire in Syria and need ammunition to bring to the table in order to rationalize a full assault in Syria.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>In my opinion they sure as hell fucked up the first crucial part; banning firearms. Bill Clinton&#39;s Federal Assault Weapons ban had a good leash on the number of Rifles(far superior to pistols) in American hands, but once that expired and the subsequent numerous blocked efforts of Obama to enact similar bans resulted in Record high numbers of Ar-15&#39;s being sold, combined with the rise of 80% receivers(potentially untraceable) they lost a major advantage. If the US government cannot quietly contain this and it becomes a Civil War, foreign intervention will present too large of a danger to risk any US government operation at a grand level.
The endgame for the Left is Communism, and they have been using Cultural Marxism as a foot into the door to Socialism, which is designed to transition into communism(Marx wrote about this) At some point they want a &quot;revolution&quot; and the globalist desire world communism to protect their power/wealth and prevent anyone ever being able to compete with them in the future. </p>
