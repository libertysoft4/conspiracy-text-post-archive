    <div class="md"><p>Don&#39;t politicize this shit. PizzaGate, in it&#39;s current form, holds a heavily politicized connotation (anti-Cunton - DNC - Democrat). Revisit with evidence of this shit happening within the RNC, as well (Boy&#39;s Town - Bush/Reagan call boys). This is why PG is getting rejected so hard. People are still buying into the two party paradigm. It has nothing to do with parties, views, ideologies, per se. But sick fucks in the ruling elite (political class). PG needs to be re-branded, imo. This is coming from someone who knows a shit tonne about marketing and a &quot;conspiracy theorist&quot;...</p>

<p>This is about following leads, wherever they are, in order to bring justice and possibly save lives from these sick fuckers. Re-frame it, as not politicized, but epidemic in the elite class for profit/blackmail... </p>

<p>My two cents..</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is my thing with Pizzagate, is that there have been a lot of accusations of this sort before....on both sides. Yet no investigation and other mysterious happenings that people write off as coincidence.</p>

<p>This is a real thing that is happened, and I agree that the two party midset is whats keeping these fuckers in power.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Don&#39;t tell people specifics that are likely to cause very real psychological trauma.  A lot of the stuff associated with PizzaGate is really horrible, and unless said information is being used for the purpose of bringing charges or making arrests, there is no point in immersing either yourself or them in it.</p>

<p>The most important point that you need to make with anyone, is that the institutions which they currently rely on, are not to be trusted.  Letting people know that politicians are paedophiles, by itself, is as specific as you need to get in 99% of cases; the rest will just horrify and distress people and cause them to view you as a lunatic in order to protect themselves.  That is the main reason why people are so resistant to accepting this, because of how awful it is.</p>

<p>I believe that the primary goal should again be reducing/removing mainstream trust in the existing institutions, so that said institutions can be replaced and run by people with genuine integrity.  The objective should not be to needlessly shock people purely for its&#39; own sake.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think I have been traumatized. EVERY SINGLE time I see a child or a picture of one on Facebook or something I question whether they have been compromised.  And I think about the parents , if I know them, would they be capable of doing that or putting the child in a situation like that? It&#39;s a fleeting thing that passes my mind, but still disturbing nonetheless.  I hope it will eventually go away </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s shitty that this person waited until you were at work to voice his opinion and go on the attack about something you&#39;d put on FB. The upside is he&#39;s shown you who he is, so believe him.  </p>

<p>Let the situation sit for a few days and give some thought to how you&#39;ve been treated simply because you have a different perspective. </p>

<p>The onus isn&#39;t on you to fix this. If there&#39;s any type of relationship to be salvaged, even if it&#39;s only that of co-workers, it&#39;s on the person who attacked to apologise. For now, keep being your awesome self and let him feel the loss. You can&#39;t fix it because you didn&#39;t break it. </p>

It&#39;s ok to have your beliefs questioned, how else would we come to our own conclusions.

No, not yet. </p>

<p>Will the truth be uncovered if they are pedos?
Hopefully, but maybe through another means like clinton foundation or some other source that hasn&#39;t been found or considered yet. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Maybe you should do what some people did about 1000 years ago to convert people by force. It worked for a few hundred years.</p>

<p>Or maybe look up at the Call1phates. Another sure way of forcing people to believe in pizzahate.</p>

<p>Of course if you have any respect for your friends, and any trust, you&#39;ll let them come to you if they have questions... or let them believe whatever the hell they want.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Don&#39;t bother. I gave up trying to reason with ignorant people many years ago. Just bare in mind it&#39;s generally not their fault they are ignorant. They are conditioned by mainstream society to be ignorant and are far too reliant on the system to see it any other way. Many of us were ignorant too at one stage. Try not to take it personally</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Anyone I&#39;ve talked to about it, I&#39;ve left clinton out of it for the most part.  I&#39;ve focused on the fact that this type of thing has happened, and with the recent busts around the world, it&#39;s easy to show that it&#39;s still happening, and if you then tie it to the media cover ups associated with it, you&#39;ve set the stage for the acceptance of it without ever mentioning clinton or the dnc.</p>
