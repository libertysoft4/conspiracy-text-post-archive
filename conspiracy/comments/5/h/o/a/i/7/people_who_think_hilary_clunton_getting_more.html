    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s a compromise.  Each state deserves to have it&#39;s voice heard.  Most of the population is on the coasts so this way the less populated states have a say. Someone said that if you removed California from the pool hillary would not have won the popular vote either. So saying that it should be strictly popular voting in this case means let&#39;s all do what California wants.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s exactly what they had in mind. The electoral college is there for a reason. </p>

<p>That &quot;popular vote&quot; that everyone thinks Hillary won. It&#39;s flawed for two reasons. </p>

<ol>
<li><p>Each state has their own separate election. There is no national election. So adding up the total overall votes is disingenuous.</p></li>
<li><p>You are actually voting on an elector. When all the ballots have been cast it is decided which candidate won a majority of that state and the elector typically pledges to vote that way during the electoral college vote.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>To say someone won the popular vote is not only irrelevant, but downright damaging to the system we use. It teaches people to have a misinformed perception of the system.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>In most states it is required that all of the electors vote for the winner of the popular vote. It wasn&#39;t always that way. Only 3 states had it that way during the 1st election after that it was changed. It wasn&#39;t until sometime during the 1880&#39;s that the states started to change it back to winner take all. </p>

<p>As it&#39;s up to each state to decide whether to be winner talk or some other way it&#39;s easyer to change. There is a movement to make the voting proportional to the popular vote but it has to be agreed to by a certain number of states before the change will take effect. </p>
