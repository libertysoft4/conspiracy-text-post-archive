        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Yo mods, don&#39;t shadow ban me for this--I was told I could post and will be keeping an eye out. Ban this and I&#39;ll believe something weird is going on. Edit: my detailed replies to everyone are being shadowbanned. Not sure what&#39;s going on and am awaiting mod response. </p>

<p>Edit 3,203: Many of my replies are in the automod catch, so they need to be personally approved by the mods for the next 48 hours.</p>

<p>Edit 2: <a href="/u/ReallyLegitX">/u/ReallyLegitX</a> just threatened me with a &quot;you&#39;ve gone too far. The clock is ticking&quot;-type message that I&#39;ve reported to the mods. </p>

<hr/>

<p>Here&#39;s the premise (and please ask me for specifics and to elaborate in the comments, because doing so here means there&#39;s too much to dissect): The US/EU destabilize countries and privatize everything. This is done with &quot;pro-Democracy&quot; groups like Soros sowing dissent. As part of the destabilised country&#39;s interim, they oversee elections, and often appoint the person who will fit the agenda they want to push for the rest of the country. They also bankrupt the nation and as part of the IMF bailout terms and conditions, they have to accept privatization reforms.</p>

<p>All of their children&#39;s welfare groups associated with the US/EU also push for the privatization of child care. They emphasize foster care. The countries in which they did this (Romania, Bulgaria, Albania, Moldova, Ukraine) became regions known as the &quot;fourth wave&quot; of trafficking. It didn&#39;t exist under the communist regimes. </p>

<p>For the first few years, these child welfare groups milked aid money from the revolving door between their organizations and those distributing the aid, like the EU Commission, USAID, etc. Once the &quot;humanitarian crisis&quot; angle dried up, they initiated step 2: the handover of their organization to the crime gangs. In Romania, for example, they freed the criminals as an act of pardon which means they know exactly who to appoint. These gangs then exploited the children--&quot;foster care&quot; became brothels, &quot;adoption&quot; became sale into sex slavery, and &quot;street children&quot; programs became forced begging.</p>

<p>These child welfare groups had partnerships with Italian municipalities. Similarly, organized crime groups trained under Italian mafias. It&#39;s also why we see Romanian children appearing in Italy. The partnerships of the orgs in the mid-90s align with the rise of the mafia, as do the trading routes. These child welfare groups are on record as having misallocated lots of donation funds, often for gifts, mysterious trips, and lavish events for government municipalities and their connections. </p>

<p>In Kosovo, the EU/US (under B Clinton) elevated Thaci&#39;s Kosovo Liberation Army. The guy&#39;s clan is a known child trafficker, organ smuggler, and the Albanian mafia today--many of whom were former KLA officials--account for some of the biggest human smugglers in existence. This includes for things like delivering kids for pedophiles throughout Europe. As to the US, many of Thaci&#39;s former KLA members are sitting in US-based embassies. Camp Bondsteel exists to shuttle out heroin and kids, if the need arises. This is also why the Albanian mafia does not operate in DC but does in other parts of Europe and the US.  </p>

<p>I&#39;ve not researched past 2001, but the template of overthrowing leaders, installing puppet dictators, and privatizing the child welfare system is consistent with other areas in question like Haiti.</p>

<p>Albania/Kosovo also has deeply Satanic connections that I can discuss. </p>

<p>So regarding this work, AMA for greater details and links. I&#39;m happy to provide it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>And that&#39;s the thing: The Albanian mafia is one of the biggest traffickers of heroin. Al Qaida was on the ground helping to train the Kosovo Liberation Army alongside US troops in the mid-90s... and then by 2003, the US took over poppy production by invading Afghanistan and putting in Karzai. It&#39;s believed that 911 was a big excuse to entrench the heroin production and trafficking.</p>

<p>Then in 2000, BOOM--heroin epidemic because pharmaceuticals were pushing opium-based drugs like oxycontin, dilaudid, etc... and when that dried up people switched to actual heroin. The CIA had a lot to do with securing that, and the person who blew the whistle was framed for child porn.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s about the people behind Pizzagate: If we&#39;re eyeing Clinton, then who was the rallying force behind the Kosovo Liberation Army despite this group controlling the child trafficking trade? Read this article because it says not only did Kosovo&#39;s KLA control the trafficking trade, but Western forces were completely in on it. Who were the Western forces, exactly? Clinton. John Podesta was the chief of staff during this time, and he consistently rallied for an independent Kosovo. Thaci paid the Podesta Group 50k a month for lobbying. </p>

<p>This is why Breitbart said, &quot;Fuck you, John Podesta&quot; for being a world class child trafficking protector. Plus, I have hunches that Clinton pulled this exact same template as Kosovo in Haiti.</p>

<p>Although the purported Facebook friend stated that Petersen died of a suicide, an official cause of death has not been announced as of this writing.</p>

<p>Monica Petersen may have been critical of the Clinton Foundation&#39;s work in Haiti (although the evidence presented comes from secondary sources and not from Petersen herself), but there&#39;s no evidence linking the Clintons to her death. </p>

<p>“How prog-guru John Podesta isn’t household name as world class underage sex slave op cover-upperer defending unspeakable dregs escapes me,” Mr. Breitbart wrote Feb. 4, 2011.</p>

<p>He died on March 1st, less than a month later of heart failure. And then his coroner died too. From being poisoned. By arsenic.</p>

<p>Nancy Schaefer</p>

<p>Former Senator Nancy Schaefer and her husband were found dead in their home in Habersham County. Even before a GBI investigation could be initiated, media outlets began pronouncing that their death was a “murder-suicide” and shut off most public comment posting on their web sites. The “murder suicide” theory implies that Sen. Schaefer’s husband shot her and then killed himself (or vice versa). Both Habersham County and the Georgia Bureau of Investigation began investigating the case as a “murder suicide” rather than the more obvious “murder made to look like suicide”. Like so many people, I have known former Sen. Nancy Schaefer for 15 years and spoken to several people who know her better than I do. They believe that the “murder suicide” theory is highly unlikely for any one of the following reasons:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>It is totally against Nancy Schaefer’s consistently strong commitment to the sanctity of life principles that she has fought so valiantly to uphold;</p></li>
<li><p>Nancy and her husband, Bruce, have five children and more than a dozen grandchildren who they would not choose to leave behind so abruptly;</p></li>
<li><p>Bruce’s problem with cancer was corrected and under control so there was no reason to end his life as one senator tried to imply;</p></li>
<li><p>Nancy or Bruce would not likely agree to commit such an act that violates the fundamental principles of their Christian faith;</p></li>
<li><p>Bruce was retired and the couple did not appear to be in any type of dire financial crisis that would lead them to commit such acts;</p></li>
<li><p>Bruce and Nancy knew that her sister who had Alzheimer’s disease needed her to help take care of her;</p></li>
<li><p>Friends who knew the couple best state that Bruce would simply not have the capability to kill his wife;</p></li>
<li><p>Nancy was dedicated, as a national leader, to help needy people overcome abuse within Child Protective Services organizations;</p></li>
<li><p>Nancy was actively exposing corruption within the Department of Family &amp; Child Services (DFCS) including actions by the DFCS director in the county where she lived.</p></li>
<li><p>Nancy knew that she was needed in the fight against child sex slave trafficking in Atlanta which has one of the highest activity rates in the country;</p></li>
<li><p>Bruce was highly supportive of Nancy’s work for decades and would have little or no reason to suddenly try to kill her at such a critical juncture in her career.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Specifically in Georgia, former Senator Nancy Schaefer had found during the last few years that:</p>

<p>– in Georgia housed children in a foster home with a known pedophile who molested the children.</p>

<p>– in Habersham County failed to remove six children from a home where they are being abused and tortured.</p>

<p>– in Georgia turned two girls over to a California father who had a pornographic video business.</p>

<p>A report that Nancy Schaefer produced on these remarkable cases can be found here:</p>

<p><a href="http://fightcps.com/2008/02/29/report-of-georgia-senator-nancy-schaefer-on-cps-corruption/">http://fightcps.com/2008/02/29/report-of-georgia-senator-nancy-schaefer-on-cps-corruption/</a></p>

<p>Nancy Schaefer was also interviewed extensively by talk show host Alex Jones about corruption in Child Protection Services nationally. A multi-part series of her interview and an Eagle Forum presentation can be found on You Tube here:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=nancy+schaefer&amp;amp;search_type=&amp;amp;aq=f">http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=nancy+schaefer&amp;amp;search_type=&amp;amp;aq=f</a></p>

<p>In addition, Senator Schaefer led opposition to HB582 and SB304, two bills introduced by fellow Republicans that would have likely resulted in increasing child sex slave trafficking. These bills would have made it legal for teenagers to participate in certain illicit acts. The bills effectively removed the legal authority that police now have to pick teenagers up and get them into protective custody so that they can no longer be pimped for those acts.</p>

<p>As President of Georgia Eagle Forum, Nancy Schaefer planned to be in Alabama this weekend for an Eagle Forum convention. Instead she chose to stay in Georgia to develop new information that would have further exposed corruption in DFCS and beyond. Many Eagle forum members who were close to Sen. Schaefer were aware of her courageous efforts. None of them believe that either she or her husband was involved in any type of suicide.</p>

<p>It is particularly ironic that the Atlanta Journal Constitution (AJC) chose to quote State Sen. Don Thomas in their March 26 article about Sen. Schaefer’s death. The AJC portrayed him as a friend of the couple even though he lives on the other side of the state from the Schaefer family and was diametrically opposed to many of their core beliefs. Sen. Thomas, the Chairman of the Health and Human Services Committee, immediately propagated and expanded the “murder-suicide” theory without any first-hand knowledge or evidence. That is very disturbing considering it is his committee that should have been helping to clean up the corruption at DFCS. Activists supporting Sen. Schaefer explained that he constantly advocated increased power and authority for DFCS in spite of the evidence showing the organization was misusing that authority.</p>

<p>With Nancy Schaefer no longer on the scene the question may be raised as to how best to continue her legacy. I believe that she would want conservatives, progressives, libertarians, constitutionalists as well as grass roots Democrats and Republicans throughout Georgia to unite and work to rectify the corruption in DFCS and eliminate child sex slave trafficking in Georgia. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That has nothing to do with &quot;sex worker activists&quot; and is literally one link to a PDF that is highly critical at best of CPS as a whole, which also seems like it&#39;s written somewhat non-objectively.

<p>-also a youtube playlist to conspiracy videos, your own comment, and a link to this subreddit aren&#39;t legit sources. I see nothing about &quot;quite a few deaths&quot; there most importantly. I see no deaths, no deaths and no sex slaves. It doesn&#39;t need two overly long comments to provide sources to info about multiple human deaths, I&#39;m sorry. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s no problem. The reason why this happens is because of an automod rule that catches posts made by new accounts. This was implemented a couple of years ago to combat people creating new accounts for trolling. They could always start &quot;cooking&quot; new accounts, but that would require some planning and forethought which most trolls don&#39;t really have. It seemed to do the trick as our problem disappeared almost instantly. (This rule, my idea btw, was the reason I was demodded by donbueno a couple of years ago.) Sorry for any confusion or grief this may have caused you. I assure you our intention was never to censor anyone just to stem a tidal wave of terrible people who meant to do our sub harm.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sure: For one, look at the history of the Albanian flag.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDjlS2SaFME">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDjlS2SaFME</a></p>

<p>We&#39;re talking red shield (Rothschild), which is part of the Khazarian group allegedly trying to create the one world government. Then we have the double-headed eagle, which my understanding is that it&#39;s a Babylonian symbol to identify the &quot;unknown/unspeakable&quot; god that isn&#39;t identified by name. </p>

<p>Then you have Kosovo and its many dragon/snake references. Thaci is known as &quot;the snake,&quot; the US embassy in Kosovo sits in &quot;dragon neighborhood&quot; there, and even the KLA was known as the Drenica (or, dragon) group. Milosevic actually called Albanian leaders something like &quot;blood sucking vampires.&quot;</p>

<p>Oh, and Kosovo&#39;s Dardania flag has interesting symbolism, too--it has the six-pointed star of David associated with the Bel-worshipping Khazarians, along with the seeds of life on its crest. I believe this is in reference to the rising/birth of a diabolical governing force in the country.</p>

<p>This belief is made all the more interesting by the Albanian flag removing its 5-pointed star at the end of Communism (the star being a symbol of keeping away evil).</p>

<p>Also, the Dardania region of Albania is believed to house &quot;chemically pure&quot; bloodlines on account of its mountainous region which led to a lot of in-breeding. This makes for a strong Albanian mafia that bases itself on family/blood purity similar to the Italian mafia (those two criminal groups have a bond, apparently... especially in the north).</p>

<p>Last, the trafficking route in the north of Italy is close to Milan, which is very close to the tunnel of Gotthard. Remember the satanic opening ritual there? Plus CERN? Maybe human sacrifices of kids via the Albanian mafia are going on there in order to bring forth the anti-Christ.</p>

<p>Anyway, that&#39;s my take. Hope it helped. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Magik to a certain extend is indeed real. It&#39;s not like in a fantasy movie though, where you say some words and make some gestures and immediately something spectacular happens. It has to do with the nature of consciousness, spiritual energy and the fact that invisible spiritual dimensions do exist. There are many researchers into the nature of consciousness such as Rupert Sheldrake (he calls them &quot;Morphic&quot; fields) and Dean Radin. There is a also a connection to Quantum Physics which has proven that the you can affect the outcome of experiments simply by observation.</p>

<p>The point is that consciousness creates reality. Mind is indeed over matter and psi-abilities are real. This is esoteric knowledge that secret societies and cults have known for thousands of years. It is all being kept secret from the public though using the mainstream media, science and education.</p>

<p>What these groups are doing in their rituals is creating massive amounts of negative spiritual energy. This gives the manifestation power to create a negative-oriented reality which is what they want. It also serves as &quot;food&quot; for the higher-dimensional negative beings which they serve. </p>

<p>Young children (before puberty) have a relatively pure spirit (being fresh from Source). This source of spiritual energy is what the satanists basically want to steal.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What I found is that the higher up you go, the more esoteric it gets and thus it&#39;s harder to prove. </p>

<p>I think Satanic pedophilia has been proven as &quot;a thing.&quot; The FBI has done countless stings on such satanic rituals. Now the question is whether or not the elite engage in it. I think they&#39;ve shown a proclivity for it based on Bohemian Grove rituals that have been secretly recorded. </p>

<p>Interestingly, a lot of people take Clinton&#39;s &quot;sacrifice a chicken to Moloch&quot; comment as a joke, but the celebration of Goddess Artemis actually entails animal sacrifices... including birds. Like chickens. She is goddess of the hunt. Why is Artemis relevant? It&#39;s allegedly where Clinton camped out after the election, and is at the base of the Gotthard Tunnel (that giant tunnel routing Italy to places like Switzerland). </p>

<p>The folklore behind the Gotthard tunnel is fascinating because it has the reputation as the Devil&#39;s Bridge that could only be passed if the giant rock was removed... hence the tunnel project. So if you tie in the child trafficking with the fact that it&#39;s the womb or artemis, specifically placed on an area anointed as the Devil&#39;s Tunnel, and you can see how a chicken sacrifice to Artemis is the same thing as giving an offering to the deity responsible for &quot;giving birth&quot; (her other reputation) to Moloch, or, the devil they&#39;re trying to arise form that area. </p>

<p><a href="http://vigilantcitizen.com/vigilantreport/opening-ceremony-worlds-largest-tunnel-bizarre-occult-ritual/">http://vigilantcitizen.com/vigilantreport/opening-ceremony-worlds-largest-tunnel-bizarre-occult-ritual/</a></p>

<p>Children sacrifices go back since for-ever. God in the old testament was all about proving devotion to him through sacrifice of Abraham&#39;s son, then we have the plague of Moses ripping through all of the first borns and rivers of blood, plus the Mayans... I have no doubt other clans have done similar grotesque sacrifices. I think it goes back to the concept of purity. </p>

<p>Plus there&#39;s the whole &quot;negative energy as food&quot;/loosh angle, which is to say all of us on Earth are trapped like cows in a slaughterhouse. I don&#39;t quite know about that, though. </p>

<p>So again, this is all of the speculative stuff that can&#39;t be proven because I personally have not witnessed Clinton eating kids. I can point to folklore behind the idea (including vampires drinking blood, which, Vlad the Impaler as satan helping the region defeat the Turks and the Ottoman empire fits with Albania&#39;s own history in the Balkans). So... not sure.</p>

<p>I definitely think there&#39;s a massive organ harvesting ring. Thaci (Albania) was known for that, and Israel especially seems to be at the crux of organ harvesting. Rahm Emanuel might be worth a look since his dad was Israeli intelligence and he as the mayor of Chicago celebrated an organ donor day, on top of being a huge Kosovo supporter. I haven&#39;t researched this angle very thoroughly but I think there are leads to be had. </p>

<p>Demonic child abuse ... here are two videos with mainly footage from the 80&#39;s, before the MSM stopped covering this stuff!</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sLgNm_ay4Sk">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sLgNm_ay4Sk</a></p>

<p>and then there&#39;s this one, which is as horribly believable or &#39;believably horrible&#39;, not sure which ... but FUCKING HELL! and <em>I had little Idea!</em> this kind of shit was going on .... or did I? </p>

<p>Y&#39;know, now I think about it, I know of at least one person who&#39;s told me of something like this BUT I think I thought they were &#39;making it all up!&#39; .... <sup><sup><sup><sup>fuck!</sup></sup></sup></sup></p>

<p>What really gets to me is how all these kids &quot;thought it was *normal&quot;!!!</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-qTCqZ7HiHw">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-qTCqZ7HiHw</a></p>

<p>In a way that helps a lot to explain how they would rarely say anything to other people ... kids don&#39;t complain about the things they don&#39;t like doing, like she says in the first video, like &quot;having to eat greens or brushiing their teeth or going to school, nobody likes that BUT <em>you still have to do it</em>! Same with going to &quot;the church&quot; &quot;  PLUS there&#39;s &quot;family&quot; involved ... </p>

<p>BOOM! the way she says that rocked me! It begins to make sense how they keep these kids quiet, firstly (and it makes even more &#39;sense&#39;) there are whole &quot;families&quot; of these people! (and they most likely have &#39;nepotistic networks&#39; = &quot;jobs for All the &#39;kids&#39; !&quot;- Plus their Abusers <em>normalize&quot;</em> the behaviour in them from birth, (quite literally, If they can) so these kids grow up thinking behaving like this is &quot;normal&quot; ... fuck.ing.hell.!</p>

He presided at the Bohemian Grove for a while. He has a series of youtube talks about his experience. He mentioned that the killing of something innocent is one of their most powerful ritual/spells. I can&#39;t remember if he mentioned the aim of it, but the more innocent the creature, the more powerful the spell.</p>

<p>The other thing he mentioned was that the torture and molestation of children was used as a grooming technique and to break them mentally</p>

    <div class="md"><p>YES! Organs are huge money. IIRC, most of the ones harvested got shipped off to Israelis and Middle Easterners for 40k a pop. </p>

<p>Then there&#39;s this bizarre piece of evidence that I found: the mayor of Tirana requested that this charity work in three places--one was Tirana the capital (which makes sense, even though refugee camps from here had trafficking issues), the second was Shkoder which became one of the worst spots for child trafficking up to Italy (90% of families didn&#39;t want to send their kids to school because it became too difficult to go outside), and the third was Peshkopi. </p>

<p><a href="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm199899/cmselect/cmintdev/422/422app05.htm">http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm199899/cmselect/cmintdev/422/422app05.htm</a></p>

<p>I looked up Peshkopi to see if it had any significance to trafficking. It didn&#39;t, but it was one of the yellow houses used by the KLA as a waypoint for organ harvesting. </p>

<p><a href="https://thebloodyellowhouse.wordpress.com/2009/04/12/kosovo-albanian-organ-harvesting-atrocity-new-testimonies/">https://thebloodyellowhouse.wordpress.com/2009/04/12/kosovo-albanian-organ-harvesting-atrocity-new-testimonies/</a></p>

<p>Peshkopi had absolutely no other significance that I could find. So, why the hell would the mayor request a charity&#39;s presence there if it wasn&#39;t being used as a front for more nefarious purposes?</p>

<p>Link for detailing how crucial Shkoder was as a trafficking hub. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have been very suspicious of the small channel island Jersey and what connection it might have to all this. The island is a very large tax haven worth roughly 2 trillion dollars. It&#39;s only 5 by 9 miles in size, so thats about 5 billion per square mile. Many elites hide there money here. Not only that but there is a history of large scale sexual abuse scandals and cover ups. I have been searching for connections between Jersey and Tavistock, Soros, Clinton Foundation, and what we are seeing in the podesta leaks. I did a  Post on this that got some attention and some people digging but eventually died out. I&#39;ll link my post in case you didn&#39;t get a chance to see it.

    <div class="md"><p>Sure. This report offers a really good overview from 1990-2000. There&#39;s also the book, &quot;Sex Trafficking: Inside the business of modern day slavery,&quot; which discusses the phenomena of human trafficking out of this area corresponding to the mid-90s. Child abduction and prostitution of course existed under Communism, but it was nowhere near an epidemic like it was in the 1990s. </p>

<p>Just like globalisation is about setting up multinational, international trade of goods and services... this is the exact same thing that happened when globalists began running these countries in the mid-90s. </p>

<p><a href="http://www.childtrafficking.org/pdf/user/balkan_trafficking.pdf">http://www.childtrafficking.org/pdf/user/balkan_trafficking.pdf</a></p>

<p>From this report you&#39;ll read that Albania became a huge port for trafficking up through Italy. Romania also started trafficking out of Moldova, Bulgaria, and the Ukraine. If you look at the annual reports of child welfare groups like Save the Children and EveryChild, you&#39;ll notice partnerships in the exact same trafficking regions. </p>

<p>As to source validity, it&#39;s interesting because the same organizations responsible for overseeing border patrol and training the police during war times (OCED) are the same ones publishing trafficking statistics. This organization also has links to Soros, and a member of the OCED was also a head director for the European Children&#39;s Trust in Albania shortly before the Kosovo conflict. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>What role does the CIA play in this scenario? Other than being on the front lines of destabilization and regime change?</p>

<p>First of all, are they friend, foe, or simply opportunists to the Bush-Clinton-Soros-Rothschild syndicate? Is there some subfaction of the CIA that has gone bad, or is the whole organization rotten to the core? How manipulable is the CIA by the executive office? Is it even possible for Trump to drain that portion of the swamp if he wanted to? </p>

<p>Is the CIA doing the physical trafficking (guns, drugs, humans) themselves or do they create the conditions for some other cartel(s) to do the deed? </p>

<p>Does their role include manipulating the media for cover - was there an overt or covert program put in place after HW shut down Mockingbird? </p>

<p>Is the post-HW Bush CIA a continuation of the pre-HW Bush CIA? Was there a shift in power that occurred during HW Bush&#39;s administration that coincided with the initiation of or an increase in CIA trafficking?</p>

<p>How do the Obamas fit in here? Of what significance is Obama&#39;s first choice of Panetta, close friend/colleague of Podesta, to direct the CIA? </p>

<p>My thought on pizzagate is that the CIA has been proven to be involved in international weapons and drug markets - why wouldn&#39;t they be involved in the one other big dark market - humans. Trying to figure out whether they are the initiators or the facilitators or both. </p>

Given that the KLA was raking in funds in trafficking, while this guy had known ties to intelligence agencies, I really can&#39;t reconcile the two in my head at all... especially because this same person worked for the OECD which was ensuring the KLA&#39;s police was trained and that borders were managed (two crucial factors for securing a trafficking operation). I don&#39;t want to name this person because the last thing I want is a witch hunt and to jeopardize this sub. This was one connection that made me think this children&#39;s organization was fishy.</p>

<p>If I were to extrapolate the US&#39;s involvement in trafficking based on what I have strong inferences about regarding the British, then it&#39;s this: the US has child welfare orgs heavily controlled by those on top. They put in members of the CIA to play a managing part of the on-the-ground operations of that &quot;charity.&quot; Then they work with the puppet regime to do the dirty work of moving people from point A to B. </p>

<p>From what I gather, the media manipulation falls to the Soros-think tanks, plus whatever &#39;powers that be&#39; operate the handful of corporate media organizations. </p>

<p>Sorry for the limited answers. I won&#39;t tell you what I don&#39;t know, at least.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Michael Rich, CEO of Rand Corporation (subsidiary of Tavistock) sits on the board of Everychild, which was a child welfare organization doing work in Kosovo during the conflict. It has ties to other organizations (Barnardos) who have been accused of sexually abusing children and sending them abroad. Cherly Saban who sits on the board of the Clinton Foundation and is closely associated with the Clintons also has ties to Everychild.</p>

<p>Many other individuals associated with Tavistock have worked for or been associated with this charity. </p>

<p>EDIT: Investigating a non-profit shouldn&#39;t be considered a witch hunt. Also Tavistock is no stranger to public scrutiny. We have to name some names in order to open new leads</p>

I have been doing a ton of research myself on this Mafia but I discovered that the name of the Mafia is the Khazarian mafia and it includes people like Soros, Rothschild, Rockafellar and much more. They are a few thousand strong I think and they are responsible for taking over the world and causing much of its misery. They also worship Baal/Satan. See my post here and please look into this. This is as critical as it gets. We need to uncover:</p>

    <div class="md"><p>To be honest, I did a lot of dot connecting with one European organization. I do not know who I can name and can&#39;t name in the hyper-sensitive context of no witch hunts. I started commenting on one shortly before Pizzagate got the ban hammer so I don&#39;t want that to happen here.</p>

<p>But I will say this: Look at the child welfare groups getting the most funding in Romania--especially from the EU Commission, USAID, UNICEF, etc--since that country seems to be a hot spot. I was able to find the company paperwork and corporate returns easily. A lot of these have known controversies surrounding their funding allocations--those are especially shady because I allege they were spending them on corrupt politicians that later became crime syndicates engaging in the trafficking, with their blessing. </p>

<p>When you go to Kosovo, look to the staff members sitting on these organizations. Look at where they went, which organizations they started working for (especially Soros-related ones). See if the directors belonged to any medical hospitals and tie that back to Tavistock since I strongly suspect medical testing on children in these regions as well. If you can place any of them to military/intelligence agencies that to me is a red flag because the whole purpose of the military at this time was to support the KLA. This to me is hugely inconsistent with running a charity group especially when the KLA was trafficking.  </p>

<p>This is what I see as the overall picture. </p>

<p>While I think this is what&#39;s happening, I stopped my research when the company hit 2001. It took too much of a toll on my psyche and it still does. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is interesting but has nothing to do with Pizzagate, also it has never been proven that mafias traffic in young children on a large scale basis in the West (not saying it doesn&#39;t happen, it simply hasn&#39;t been proven). Romanian/Roma mafias use their own children for instrumentalized criminal purposes (thievery, etc.), but this is decidedly different than child trafficking on a routinely large scale basis, as opposed to opportunistic occurrences. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It has EVERYTHING to do with pizzagate: aside from the Clintons elevating the greatest child trafficking group into power (the Kosovars/Albanians), where do you think most of these prostitution rings come from? Foster families. Time and again we see exploitation of this vulnerable group, which again ties back to my point here: the globalist structure systematically promotes foster care and decentralization of the system for the exact purpose of exploitation. </p>

<p>As to mafias not being linked to trafficking, where to begin...</p>

<p>Here&#39;s details about the Albanians...
<a href="http://www.ungift.org/docs/ungift/pdf/vf/backgroundpapers/Koca_albania.pdf">http://www.ungift.org/docs/ungift/pdf/vf/backgroundpapers/Koca_albania.pdf</a></p>

<p><a href="http://www.pri.org/stories/2011-03-27/kosovos-mafia-hotbed-human-trafficking">http://www.pri.org/stories/2011-03-27/kosovos-mafia-hotbed-human-trafficking</a></p>

<p>(the last one being my favorite because it specifically cites the US&#39;s involvement in the matter).</p>

<p>Also, this is how the KLA made money. Have you ever heard of the Arizona Market? It was this &quot;free market&quot; place near the Bosnia/Serbia border where gang members of all stripes came to buy, sell, and trade young women. DynCorp was implicated here too, by the way, which makes me think they rather intentionally give these military contracts to groups that knowingly turn a blind eye to the role the West has in these trafficking operations. </p>

<p>Romanian mafias use their own children... that are often exploited out of the orphanages set up by Westerners. If you watch this documentary, you can learn about a guy named Tom that used to work for a Romanian orphanage through a British organization. He now sells sex tours for Westerners who want to hook up with little boys. Also curious is the fact that these Romanian boys are prostituted by their OWN PARENTS. One thing I allege is that the whole &quot;keeping families together&quot; shtick offers an opportunity for the mafia to go up to these hopelessly desperate people and offer them, &quot;hey, want to make quick money?&quot; through sale of their kids. One boy even presented a child charity ID card. </p>

<p>And let&#39;s see, Barnardo&#39;s shipped off British children to Australia who had been sexually abused in their homes... only to partner with the European Children&#39;s Trust in the mid-90s for a Balkan project. </p>

<p>Then there&#39;s Save the Children, where boats connected with the Italian Coast Guard are making several off-the-record shipments to/from Africa-Italy, where prostitution of Nigerians is a BIG deal... </p>

<p>And let&#39;s see, an employee of Save the Children having brutal, masochistic CP that was being video recorded where the kids are undergoing severe deprivation reminiscent of MK Ultra programming...</p>

<p>It&#39;s allll connected. These are not one-off things. It&#39;s an entire system.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That one&#39;s painful, I&#39;m sorry... I still feel sick to my stomach whenever I picture it.</p>

<p>I guess it won&#39;t help you to know that the Tavistock Portman clinic was doing &quot;cutting edge research&quot; surrounding infant attachment disorders, trauma, and psychotherapy around this time. </p>

<p>I was glad to stick with researching the overview stuff because when I started reading the stories about trafficking and experimentation, I actually experienced symptoms that were only congruous with trauma as well... and that was just from reading about it.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You know, I&#39;ve read so much about ritual abuse over the last couple of years and I went through the nightmare stages but had sort of become numb to it but PG has brought it all back and I am now going through it all again. Like yourself I was sticking to the overview and just pointing people in the direction of things I already knew while avoiding it myself. It just hits you right in the heart and knocks the wind from your gut, doesn&#39;t it? It&#39;s too much. I&#39;m so sad people had to find out about this but I feel a great movement is happening. I don&#39;t care if people think I&#39;m crazy, I&#39;ll call it when I see it now. Fuck these sick fuckers.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Very interesting read. Now do you think that destabilizing the great nation of Yugoslavia played a role in all of this ? I mean Bill Clinton was in office at the time.</p>

<p>Edit: I&#39;m well educated on the breaking up of the Balkans don&#39;t get me wrong . Of course there was conflict between all the nations , but perhaps there was also an ulterior motive to Albania gaining it&#39;s independency or it was just taken advantage of by the west after the fact .</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t know as much about Yugoslavia because that was the US&#39;s dirty work more than Europe&#39;s... but I do think the US was starting to support Albania&#39;s existing president, Sali Berisha. Europe wanted Thaci. Thaci and Berisha didn&#39;t get along, and the US branded Thaci and all of the KLA as a terrorist group. </p>

<p>From what I&#39;ve read, Berisha was being backed by a guy named Bukosi, which was this rich dude collecting all of the diaspora money in Germany. He was a mild gentleman, even though Berisha was no saint. He just wasn&#39;t as rogue as Thaci.</p>

<p>The advantage of Albania gaining independence was probably its proximity to Greece and Turkey. These were already US allies and provided a great gateway to move stuff from places like the Midd East up through Western Europe. It made for a good way point. This is what I gathered from reading about the drug route and the trafficking routes.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know why Europe picked the more renegade of the two factions in Albania. All I know is the US went from branding the KLA as a terrorist organization to all of a sudden being like, &quot;we want <em>these</em> guys&quot; in power. Likewise, I don&#39;t know why Europe picked Thaci. If it had something to do with the &quot;better bloodline&quot; (super conspiracy alert) then Thaci was I think the better pick. </p>

<p>This might have also been a decision based in Italy since all I know is that the Albanian mafia and Italian mafia in the north seem to get along well. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sloppy, very sloppy, I&#39;m sorry to say. EU&#39;s own reports expressly states: &quot;While victim caseloads and expert opinions based on assisted child victims of trafficking for begging and pick-pocketing allow some empirical discussion on the profiles of the children involved, there is no such reference point for determining the profile of boys, trafficked for sexual exploitation. Statistical evidence was provided in Bulgaria, where court decisions reveal that in the period 2011 – 2013 there were between 10 and 14 boy victims of “trafficking for debauchery” each year. This constitutes about one fifth of the victims of sexual exploitation...Similarly, in Romania few cases of boys were officially registered as victims of sexual exploitation in recent years. Eight cases of boy victims of trafficking were recorded by the Romanian authorities in 2012 and 14 were registered in 2010...Although there are no identified boys victims of trafficking for sexual services in Hungary, the statistics of the Unified System of Criminal Statistics of the Investigative Authorities (ENYÜBS) show 5 cases of sexual exploitation of boys in 2013.&quot;</p>

<p><a href="http://childrentrafficking.eu/new-forms-of-trafficking/sexual-exploitation-of-boys/">http://childrentrafficking.eu/new-forms-of-trafficking/sexual-exploitation-of-boys/</a></p>

<p>So these are very low numbers and consequently make it difficult to determine trafficking market dimensions, or if there even is, in effect, a market to begin with. No doubt, the numbers for girls are much higher, but again it is not demonstrated that prepubescent girls constitute a sizable &quot;exploitable&quot; market for sex trafficking gangs in Europe.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I offer this link to further prove my point, then:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/romania/8027694/Romanian-gipsy-gang-snatched-200-children-from-homes-to-use-them-as-beggars.html">http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/romania/8027694/Romanian-gipsy-gang-snatched-200-children-from-homes-to-use-them-as-beggars.html</a></p>

<p>This bolsters my point that the Romanian mafia specifically grabs children from vulnerable backgrounds (and in addition, they would know who they are, since they run the child welfare system thanks to the handoff from European/American charities).</p>

<p>Then there&#39;s this article showing that the Romanian mafia&#39;s child trafficking operations were &quot;built on the back of gang crime in Britain&quot; (ie, foreign NGOs in child welfare).  </p>

<p><a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2655054/Flash-Romanian-gypsies-UK-registered-cars-colourful-palaces-thought-funded-criminal-activities-up.html">http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2655054/Flash-Romanian-gypsies-UK-registered-cars-colourful-palaces-thought-funded-criminal-activities-up.html</a></p>

<p>As to the courts, they&#39;re notoriously corrupt in Bulgaria and Romania. They don&#39;t prosecute crimes there because they&#39;re usually in on the action. I also allege there&#39;s the deeper conspiracy at play which is the European/American faction <em>intentionally</em> creating a corrupt government in these countries.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>And that&#39;s the thing: The Albanian mafia is one of the biggest traffickers of heroin. Al Qaida was on the ground helping to train the Kosovo Liberation Army alongside US troops in the mid-90s... and then by 2003, the US took over poppy production by invading Afghanistan and putting in Karzai. It&#39;s believed that 911 was a big excuse to entrench the heroin production and trafficking.</p>

<p>Then in 2000, BOOM--heroin epidemic because pharmaceuticals were pushing opium-based drugs like oxycontin, dilaudid, etc... and when that dried up people switched to actual heroin. The CIA had a lot to do with securing that, and the person who blew the whistle was framed for child porn.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s no problem. The reason why this happens is because of an automod rule that catches posts made by new accounts. This was implemented a couple of years ago to combat people creating new accounts for trolling. They could always start &quot;cooking&quot; new accounts, but that would require some planning and forethought which most trolls don&#39;t really have. It seemed to do the trick as our problem disappeared almost instantly. (This rule, my idea btw, was the reason I was demodded by donbueno a couple of years ago.) Sorry for any confusion or grief this may have caused you. I assure you our intention was never to censor anyone just to stem a tidal wave of terrible people who meant to do our sub harm.</p>
