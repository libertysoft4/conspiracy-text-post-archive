    <div class="md"><p>Yep. This was fairly clear during the election... while Trump supporters were aggressively demanding that heads roll for some of these scandals, the actual Republican leaders were eerily silent on the issue despite the fact that exploiting the scandals to their fullest extent would have yielded more congressional seats. </p>

<p>In the past, either party has been quick to exploit whatever weakness they could and crank up the pressure until bones began to break and ligaments tore... this year? None of that. With the exception of a few people, no one touched the biggest scandals within the WikiLeaks information. The implication being that any scandal that touched BOTH parties was deemed off limits. </p>

<p>Trump himself went pretty far with some of this stuff, which is curious being that his name also shows up in the flight logs with Epstein and Mar a Lago is literally down the street from Epstein&#39;s own home... my guess is that he was just baiting the Clinton camp to bring that up because he knows that whatever dirt they can hit him with would be followed by an enormous mudslide directed back at them regarding Epstein. </p>

<p>It&#39;s still shocking to me that the American people and journalists (even non-MSM ones) are willing to overlook a major child sex scandal because their own party/candidates may be involved. Like, what the fuck guys? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The silver lining here is if you put your trust in FBIAnon.  Just like you said, Trump may get in trouble for donating to CF or for ties to Epstein, but FBIAnon alluded to no real evidence of any Trump pedo stuff.  I&#39;m skeptical myself, but I do believe FBIAnon is legit.

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t know much about the situation, but I think Trump can be forgiven for not knowing what he was getting himself into if he only went one time.</p>

<p>If he learned of something sinister, perhaps he can&#39;t be forgiven for keeping it quiet if he stumbled that sinister thing, but I am vaguely aware he kicked Epstein out of one of the establishments he owns for being a pervert. Maybe Trump intended to wait until he has the power of the presidency to drop the hammer. Maybe he&#39;ll take it to the grave. I can only hope he&#39;s truly a proponent of justice.</p>

<p>Nothing ties President Clinton or Epstein to this through wikileaks. </p>

<p>The <em>real</em> question is why is MSM pushing that Hillary is the target, when pizza gate really has little to do with her either. Is it because the mass3s sympathize with her loss, where if it was people they never heard of they would be outraged?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s because they now have an easily-dismissed conspiracy theory, which has been solidly mocked in the MSM news, and even in the late night talk shows at this point, and it comes complete with its own cute little hashtag!</p>

<p>If I were more cynical than I already am, I would think that the 4chan &quot;code words&quot; were placed deliberately after the Podesta Wikileaks, just because they knew that they could count on everyone whipping themselves into a frenzy over them.  When it turns out to be a big pile of shit (which, rest assured, it will), they have a handy scapegoat for any allegations of child trafficking leveled against TPTB.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve been following this since it broke, and I&#39;ve watched the narrative go from:</p>

<p>&quot;PODESTA AND ALEFANTIS ARE FUCKING AND EATING BABIES IN THAT PIZZA SHOP, AND POSSIBLY SERVING THEM ON THE PIZZA&quot;</p>

<p>to:</p>

<p>&quot;THEY <strong>CLEARLY</strong> RUN CHILDREN THROUGH THERE, AT A MINIMUM&quot;</p>

<p>to:</p>

<p>&quot;THAT ARTWORK PROVES THAT <strong>SOMETHING</strong> IS UP THERE&quot;</p>

<p>to: </p>

<p>&quot;THIS PLACE IS <strong>NOT</strong> FAMILY-FRIENDLY, AS ADVERTISED&quot;</p>

<p>to, finally, today:</p>

<p>&quot;Alefantis needs to apologize, and explain those Instagram pics if he wants to clear this all up.&quot;</p>

<p>By this time next week, it will be:</p>

<p>&quot;<sup>well...</sup> <sup>we</sup> <sup>know</sup> <sup>that</sup> <sup><em>something</em></sup> <sup>is</sup> <sup>going</sup> <sup>on</sup> <sup><em>somewhere</em>.&quot;</sup></p>

<p>I worry that it was a <em>masterful</em> troll.  On whose behalf, I&#39;m not sure... but rest assured that if anything comes out of the Clinton Foundation investigation, or the Silsby connection, or <em>anything</em>... the MSM will not report on it, and then they will use the #pizzagate hashtag to discredit it.</p>
