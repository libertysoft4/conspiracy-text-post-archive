This giant conspiracy is the key to every major elite conspiracy, as they are likely involving the same scum.  This is the big one and everything is at stake.  Don&#39;t stop!  They will begin contingencies soon; I, for one, am willing to lose everything for the truth to come out and see that justice is served.  Its almost 3 am east coast and the pizzagate voat subverse is being browsed by nearly as many people as <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> is.  They have 8000 users.  We have over 400k.  Its on, don&#39;t get fatigued.  Spread it in every creative way you can think of, advocate non-violence, advocate investigation.  Bring them down.  Bring them all down.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I love these kind of posts.</p>

<p>I was watching a youtube video about PG, and I saw a comment that said &quot;New Zealander checking in to show support&quot; or something like that. </p>

<p>You know what was below it? Probably a hundred comments from people showing their support from all over the world. It was beautiful. Australia, Germany, Hungary, South Africa, Japan and dozens more.</p>

<p>I started tearing up, because I realized how beautiful that is. Tens of thousands united from around the world to combat against the child abuse that has infested our power structures. Some of the Americans here, myself included, sometimes focus on just the American aspect, but we obviously have seen cases in other countries like the Dutroux affair or the UK Parliament and now Football case. </p>

<p>Internet crowd sourced revolution. Amazing. &quot;May you live in interesting times&quot;. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I mean.  Rome wasn&#39;t overthrown by outraged citizens.  It collapsed over more than a century because of many factors working in tandem.  There was a huge plague, runaway inflation, nonstop coups, invasions on several front, a mini ice age, all happening at the same and exacerbating one another.</p>

<p>What did NOT happen was the people of Rome overthrowing their leaders for being sexually depraved.  I can&#39;t honestly think of a single historical example of that happening.  I&#39;m open to hearing some, but the fall of the Roman Empire doesn&#39;t jive.  The fall of the Roman Republic doesn&#39;t jive either.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Depends on who you ask. A lot of people would attribute the weakness that allowed Rome to be overthrown as a direct result of the effeminate culture propagated by the change in behavior of their leaders.</p>

<p>Keep in mind, this isnt a pro or anti homosexuality argument. I&#39;m sure vulnerability to Barbarian hordes wasn&#39;t dependent on how individuals preferred their sex. If their leaders aren&#39;t focused on leading though, they&#39;ll eventually be lead to their destruction. The motivation largely doesn&#39;t matter, but to dismiss it entirely because it&#39;s not PC is rather silly.</p>

<p>Its not ridiculous to say that this shift in culture lead to a more passive stance of their military, leading to defense vulnerabilities they hadn&#39;t previously had to deal with. I can guarantee you their citizens weren&#39;t happy about that.</p>

<p>It&#39;s only speculative but definitely a nice read. Even if the guy is lying and isn&#39;t in some secret society he&#39;s clearly very intelligent and has interesting ideas. Claimed Jesus was in the secret society he&#39;s now in. He also predicted the Turkey coup and &#39;the happening&#39; (the black lives matter guy who was sniping cops in Dallas)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>the goverment wants globalization.<br/>
The power to controll all.<br/>
But they forget that whit globalization there while be a global public.<br/>
The global public is stronger together and harder to take down.<br/>
U can easily control a country and its people.<br/>
U can not control all the people of the world.<br/>
And if people all over the world are after u.<br/>
there is no where to hide.<br/>
.<br/>
In a country if 0.01% are after u that is a low amount.<br/>
In the world if 0.01% is after u your fucked.<br/>
Globalization is a dubble edged sword.<br/>
But these fucks think they can control everything.<br/>
I am sorry we 99% are smarter as u.<br/>
And wen robots start replacing humans on a grand scale U ALL FUCKED.<br/>
We humans will not laze around and watch t.v 24/7 we will investigate invent and explore &lt; human nature.<br/>
And wen the world is globalized it will be super easy to from powerful independent group,s whit connections all over the world.<br/>
Wikileaks unanimous is just the start.<br/>
We humans adept and overcome.<br/>
And yes 99% of us will not go there but the 1% that will, will show the rest of us whats up.<br/>
Have fun whit your global cobalt cus it will in the end explode in your face !
.<br/>
.<br/>
Have u all not notice how everytime u controll and manipulate one thing.<br/>
That thing explode and die,s out.<br/>
Only to get replaced ?<br/>
We are so close to create a decentralized internet one where u have no control at all.<br/>
The more control and manipulation u push.<br/>
The more control u and every one loses in the end.<br/>
.<br/>
.<br/>
This is what your fighting every time.<br/>

And yes the start is easy to manipulate and exploit,<br/>
But in the end they attacks on u will increase faster and faster till it brake,s your own capacity </p>

<p>nothing but Hillary email conspiracies</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You mean one of the biggest conspiracies that has hard evidence behind it, which was completely glossed over by the media</p>

<p>Like its so obvious the whole email thing is setup to circumvent the FOIA, and beyond that, just on principle she made the country less safe by using email as she did. If you really want secure email, it takes a full time staff doing network monitoring, making sure the latest patches are applied to all servers etc. </p>

<p>Shit in the wake of the shadowbroker leaks, I wouldn&#39;t trust anyone but the NSA to setup a truly secure server - HDD firmware viruses, 0-days against routers and firewalls, Intel management engine, etc etc there are just too many holes to worry about for a small team if you have an advanced persistent threat.</p>

<p>And if she wasn&#39;t technologically illiterate she would have understood this, but she wanted to have her cake and eat it to. And people don&#39;t even bring up the fact that using the same address for personal and official affairs is in my opinion an abuse of power/conflict of interest - It&#39;s like using secretary of state letterhead on personal emails. Especially if she has personal emails with the same people she is emailing professionally, the lines get real blurry. </p>

<p>But all the nuance was destroyed in this conversation because Americans don&#39;t do nuance very well and she spun it pretty successfully as an unfounded partisan attack. It absolutely was not, she fucked up, she broke the law and james comey basically said as much - the statute doesn&#39;t need intent to prove, its the act that&#39;s illegal. And it would have been easy to at least put criminal motive to it - hiding from FOIA requirements. Those emails along with podestas lost her the election, have no doubt about it</p>

<p>It is getting more and more to be just the extreme liberals who so desperately need their precious politicians to be clean that are holding to the idea that there is nothung there. So many of us dont give a damn about american politics and from an unbiased pov it is very clear that something is off here.

    <div class="md"><p>I liked the analogous sentence that somebody posted here yesterday:</p>

<p><em>&quot;Do you think I&#39;ll play football better on protein shakes than candy bars?&quot;</em></p>

<p>This is a completely reasonable statement, and you wouldn&#39;t give it a second thought if you heard somebody say it.  However, since we&#39;re all sitting here trolling through some 84-year-old man&#39;s sent e-mails, we have no context of previous history.  Maybe the last time he got killed in dominos, he blamed it on being too full from the pasta meal they just had?  Maybe they have a running inside joke about making excuses for why they lost the dominos game?  </p>

<p>Literally <em>any</em> explanation is more plausible than these the pedophilia theories that are being tossed about.  You could tell me that he&#39;s talking about cocaine (cheese) and PCP (pasta), which would still be pure bat-shit insanity... and yet 100x more plausible than this pedo angle.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, I think it is awkwardly worded, totally agree on that.  But you then want to make the leap to &quot;well, it&#39;s awkwardly worded, that seems odd so I will assume he is a pedophile&quot;.  I am willing to believe but I do require real evidence.  Everything I&#39;ve seen has a more convincing explanation than &quot;satanic pedo ring&quot;.  For example, in the above, he was sending a quick email to friends and didn&#39;t take the time to edit his email for clarity.  Now before you tell me that doesn&#39;t make perfect sense remember that I am only saying it makes <em>more</em> sense than your interpretation.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>He got a box of cheeses from Podesta as a Christmas present, instead of the usual gift of pasta and sauce from years prior.  He&#39;s going to wait until Susan and James (his grown children) return from their holiday travels (e-mail is dated 12/24) to enjoy the cheese with them.  There is at least one other e-mail where Herbert talks about playing dominos with his grown daughter, Susan.  </p>

<p>So you can either interpret it as BDSM-fueled child rape sessions with his own grown daughter, or a <em>fucking game of dominos</em>.  Which one is more likely?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The football thing is about youth coaches creeping it up of their own accord and using their position to trick or intimidate the kids into keeping quiet about it. There is, afaik, no suggestion of organised abuse. Just a classic case of paedos getting into positions of authority over kids as they are wont to do.</p>

<p>It&#39;s really annoying to see Americans mischaracterise our scandals to try and legitimise their own Satanic panics.</p>

<p>When you start altering facts and applying controversial interpretations to things (like &quot;pan is the god of pedophilia&quot;), then it&#39;s easy to create a narrative which fits with your pre-determined conclusions.  This type of story building is consistently used to discredit &quot;conspiracy theories&quot;.</p>

<p>Especially if there IS some truth to the larger allegations and concepts (which there absolutely is), now you&#39;ve managed to discredit the search for truth by associating it with a very specific and misguided investigation into a goose chase.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>I&#39;ve seen pics grabbed from pedophilia websites</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Well, you&#39;ve got me beat there.  I&#39;m not interested in being exposed to child porn in order to expose this non-existent child sex abuse ring... but huge props to you.</p>

<p>But you&#39;re still making a HUGE stretch, dude.  Out of like 50,000 emails, they&#39;ve been whittled down to about 100-200 that mention pizza or cheese.  Out of those 100-200, you&#39;ve narrowed them down to about 6 (as far as I can tell) that aren&#39;t <em>embarrassingly</em> easy to explain away as office banter, or, you know... <em>actual conversations about pizza</em>.  Out of those 6 or so, there are still perfectly plausible explanations for all but one.</p>

<p>The <strong>pizza-related map</strong> is definitely weird.  But given that it is literally <em>the only</em> e-mail that isn&#39;t painfully easy to explain, I still think that it&#39;s not anything nefarious.  Any conversation that took place on the original e-mail thread between Susan Sandler and the realtor has been lost... which is certainly a possibility, because the wikileaks thread doesn&#39;t ever show her answering the question about pillows they purchased.  It&#39;s totally plausible that the realtor described more about the handkerchief during those e-mails to Susan... including what design it had on it, and then Susan forwarded the original to Podesta in order to keep those subsequent conversations private.  I do shit like that literally every day with my work e-mails.</p>

<p>Podesta was so <em>amazingly</em> unconcerned about the alleged semen and blood-encrusted Satanic cum rag left on the kitchen island, <em>he didn&#39;t even respond for 36 hours.</em>  When he did finally respond, he said, &quot;It&#39;s mine, but not worth worrying about.&quot;</p>

<p>That&#39;s right.  This guy who was with the Clintons through the whole Monica affair was <em>so unconcerned</em> about a random Martha&#39;s Vineyard realtor having his DNA-covered Satanic child-raping jizz rag, he didn&#39;t even give her instructions to dispose of it!</p>

<p>Just think about it.  Use every bit of critical thinking capacity you have, and if you&#39;re still convinced that it was a Satanic blood and jizz-encrusted child rape trophy, then at least I&#39;ve said my piece.  There&#39;s nothing else I can do.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re 100% right to be sickened.  Any decent person would be.  I only read the text of your voat link, because I have <em>zero</em> desire to view the links.</p>

<p>That said, you&#39;re mistaken about the other emails.  They have absolutely nothing in common with what you linked from voat, and are a total red herring.</p>

<p>First off, you do realize that the phrase &quot;cheese pizza&quot; appears exactly zero times in the Podesta or Clinton e-mails, right?  It appears exactly once in the Stratfor dump... and they&#39;re talking about... wait for it... <em>a goddamn <a href="https://wikileaks.org/gifiles/docs/11/1155044_re-lunch-with-g-on-friday-.html">cheese pizza.</a></em></p>

<p>The other Stratfor e-mail that everyone has their panties in a bunch over is <strong>&quot;How thin to slice it?&quot;</strong> Jesus Christ, this is so clearly an in-joke between the Stratfor staff. The e-mail is addressed to the <em>entire Austin staff</em>, men and women alike.  Like <a href="https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/236x/2b/0e/96/2b0e96d8cd8d7bc362fc72b72903a9e9.jpg">this woman</a>.  Holy shit, there&#39;s a guilty looking pedo if I&#39;ve ever seen one.  </p>

<p>Do you <em>honestly</em> think 100% of this office just happens to be child rapists?</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know if they didn&#39;t order enough pizza last time or what, but all the jokes about filling out forms in triplicate, double-sided, color-coded, etc. is typical office humor. Plus, there&#39;s another e-mail thread about an office pizza party which shows the off-site employees bumming out since they won&#39;t be there for pizza, and the final guy insinuates that it&#39;s a bribe from management, and somebody else should eat his slice. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t know how young you are, but let me let you in on a little secret:  Those of us who work in offices eat a <em>metric fuck-ton</em> of pizza.  It&#39;s the easiest meal to bring in when you&#39;re busy.  And I think you can safely assume that Stratfor Austin is pretty fucking busy.</p>

<p>If you look at it honestly, and without rage or bias getting in your way, you quickly understand how fucking <em>ridiculous</em> is to think that their entire Austin office is planning to fuck a kid <strong>over an office-wide e-mail thread</strong>.  </p>

<p>PIZZAGATE SEZ: THE ENTIRE STRATFOR AUSTIN OFFICE IS DIVVYING UP A CHILD TO FUCK. THEY&#39;RE TRYING TO GET A COUNT OF HOW MANY PEOPLE WANT &quot;IN&quot;.</p>

<p><strong>Dominos on cheese or pasta</strong>: This one seems so blindingly obvious. Keep in mind that the author is the 83-year-old Herb Sandler. His wife Marion of 51 years died about 3 years prior. Podesta had traditionally sent him an Xmas gift of pasta and sauce (Podesta is a known &quot;foodie&quot;), but this time, he got a box of cheeses. He thanks Podesta, and says that when his children (Susan and James) get back from their holiday travels (e-mail is dated 12/24), he&#39;ll enjoy the cheeses with them. Since there are other e-mails talking about how Susan (his grown daughter) <a href="https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/34860">has beaten him at dominos before</a>, he&#39;s wondering if the cheese will improve his luck. This is a simple thank you for a Christmas gift. And fucking news flash: An 83-year-old man likes to play dominos.</p>

<p>BUT PIZZAGATE SEZ: PODESTA SENT A CHILD FOR 83-YEAR-OLD HERB TO FUCK. HE WAS EXPECTING A BOY, BUT GOT A GIRL. HE WONDERS IF HE&#39;LL BE ABLE TO DOMINATE THE LITTLE GIRL BETTER IN HIS BDSM SEX PLAY, AS HE WAS LIMP-DICKED WITH THE LITTLE BOY LAST TIME.</p>

<p>Use your brain, man.  Don&#39;t fall for this bogus shit.  It&#39;s ruining all credibility of the <em>real</em> shit going down, i.e., Silsby &amp; Hillary, people getting &quot;suicided&quot;, Epstein&#39;s pedo plane and fuck island, and all those who visit there.</p>

<p>Seriously. There is zero evidence to substantiate a child sex ring at Comet Ping Pong. I have seen nothing credible, but I keep checking back in, hoping one of you perverts will exonerate yourselves with a shred of anything beyond &quot;muh code words&quot;.</p>

<p>Yes, we know some politicians and other elites are rapists and pedophiles. Yes, we can make a safe guess we&#39;ve caught fewer of them than are still at large. And you&#39;ve caught... zero.</p>

<p>Thousands of you tards have been at work on it for a month, and the only thing you&#39;ve managed to do is scare the shit out of patrons at a pizza restaurant by getting on of your own so riled up, he tried to be an hero.</p>

<p>You failed. This whole movement is a failure. You&#39;re just too spineless to admit your failure, so you keep going after the same target.</p>

<p>And tell me, what have you actually done to help victims of sexual abuse? Have you volunteered or donated to any organization that attempts to help victims find peace? Yeah, most of you people dgaf. You&#39;re doing it because it arouses you.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I can&#39;t disagree with you on the point of evidence, but the majority of users of the sub have only one tool in order to uncover this mystery. All we have is a computer.</p>

<p>We don&#39;t have the resources of the FBI, the authority of the local PD, or even the protection for really diving head first into uncovering disgusting crimes such as this. </p>

<p>The real problem is you are asking for proof from the wrong people. Have you asked yourself, where is the proof from people in a position to provide it?</p>

<p>Understand our frustrations. We are relying on a system that prosecutes whistleblowers, that protects those with enough power that can do harm without repercussions. </p>

<p>Donate to a cause, you say? Like the Red Cross...? You hang out in this sub and point fingers. We have reasons why we don&#39;t blindly &quot;donate to a cause&quot;. There are fine &quot;normal&quot; people out there like you and me looking into these issues and they end up killed.</p>

<p>So, where is the evidence? It&#39;s being buried while we are at work, or at home, or on Reddit. It&#39;s being stolen from us as &quot;propaganda&quot; or fake news. It&#39;s being hidden under the guise of looking for evidence gets you arrested. </p>

<p>We, or maybe some, are fighting against a system with little else than an IP Address. I can only hope that you find a passion for truth and a means. It&#39;s more than we have at the moment. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You are taking the actions of one person (actor or not) and applying it to the population as a whole. That seems unfair.</p>

<p>I cannot condone putting people in danger and will never want to face a situation like that with my family. </p>

<p>Do you see the bigger picture, however? These questionable, disgusting, allegations are <strong>not being challenged thoroughly</strong>.</p>

<ul>
<li>Who were the children on the Instagram feed of the Pizza shop owner?</li>
<li>Why was one child taped to a table?</li>
<li>Why does their website have a login to large zipped files?</li>
</ul>

<p>There are many, many more questions that are not only being ignored, but pushed aside as &quot;fake news&quot;. There is no hard evidence because either: A) There is pressure from the very top to make this go away or B) There are agencies involved that are trying to keep things under wraps for investigation purposes. I hope its B, i&#39;m more concerned its A.</p>

<p>Ask yourself for one moment, as a human being, would you ever in your life post a picture of a child taped to a table to your social media feed? If not, then I hope you can understand why we, or maybe I, am so angered by this.</p>

They were abrasive as fuck and still got a calm response from Alefantis. And they were offered free coffee and got a free tour of Comet Ping Pong.</a></p>

<p>Alefantis says it&#39;s his goddaughter, and the reason she&#39;s taped to the table is because she&#39;s playing with her sister.</p>

<p>Big sis tapes little sis to the table for fun. Children do <em>really</em> stupid shit. Childish shit. Like, shit that doesn&#39;t make <em>any</em> sense whatsoever. Also, kids who are siblings do mean stuff to each other. Or &quot;playfully mean,&quot; whatever you want to call it.</p>

<p>And people always freak out about the baby with the money. Is it so hard to believe that someone would hand a stack of cash to a baby for a funny picture? That sounds funny to me. And GUESS WHAT?? BOMBSHELL: Babies put <em>fucking everything</em> in their mouth. Literally. Everything.</p>

<p>In a move disclosed Monday, Google said it will withhold lucrative digital ads from appearing on any sites that “misrepresent, misstate, or conceal information.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What if sites reporting on Pizzagate are considered &quot;Fake News&quot;? Who determines what is &quot;Fake&quot;? RIP r/pizzagate</p>

<p>Lets not forget, that <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/30/technology/facebook-tinkers-with-users-emotions-in-news-feed-experiment-stirring-outcry.html">Facebook already experiments on its users</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>But last week, Facebook revealed that it had manipulated the news feeds of over half a million randomly selected users to change the number of positive and negative posts they saw. It was part of a psychological study to examine how emotions can be spread on social media.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The two largest companies is a digital space have openly admitted to experimenting on what you see in your &quot;news feed&quot; and Google wants to help dictate what you can search for.</p>

Nothing will backfire because the media are the ones propagating this. You think they will tell a balanced story? You think people will suddenly wake up and see the world is a conspiracy? That is naive, this has happened many many times already, rights are taken away because of a made up bullshit story. Think &quot;shoe bomber&quot; just as an example. Complete bullshit yet we still have to take our shoes off to fly. That is a much less impactful freedom to lose, but it is a simple example.

<p>Editor’s Note: The Washington Post on Nov. 24 published a story on the work of four sets of researchers who have examined what they say are Russian propaganda efforts to undermine American democracy and interests. One of them was PropOrNot, a group that insists on public anonymity, which issued a report identifying more than 200 websites that, in its view, wittingly or unwittingly published or echoed Russian propaganda. A number of those sites have objected to being included on PropOrNot’s list, and some of the sites, as well as others not on the list, have publicly challenged the group’s methodology and conclusions. The Post, which did not name any of the sites, does not itself vouch for the validity of PropOrNot’s findings regarding any individual media outlet, nor did the article purport to do so. Since publication of The Post’s story, PropOrNot has removed some sites from its list.</p>

But the main point of my post was that these people have been publicly accused of a crime, and everyone here thinks they are just continuing on as if nothing has happened and would be stupid enough to still be using places people are stalking for their crimes.  If you really believe all of this Pizzagate stuff, do you really believe they are dumb enough to not change the sites they use or lay low for a while?  I think anyone going to Comet Ping Pong now and thinking they will find someone in the act is certifiably batshit crazy. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Right. I am all for people having and expressing their opinions.  And we should not all live in an echo chamber.  But what is more pathetic.  Being a conspiracy theorist.  Or somebody who comes onto a conspiracy forum to randomly argue with conspiracy theorists?  Most people i know who are not into these sorts of things just go about their day and dont waste their time and energy to dispute it.  Sure if somebody comes to you then you may get into a discussion.  But going out of your way to get into an argument.  Seems strange to me.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The first thing I read on this sub about PG was the emails to John Podesta referencing pizza related maps, as well as a reference to pasta, which are apparently code names for sex with children (although I&#39;ve never seen official evidence of this). I read into Tony Podesta&#39;s fucked up art collection and his connections. I read about the strange events held at Comet Pizza and Ping Pong, which happens to be located near a few establishments also related to the Podesta&#39;s and other high ranking officials. I read about the fundraisers that they held for certain Democratic candidates. I watched some shitty cell phone videos of independent investigators looking for tunnels. I read about a government official who works in the area for law enforcement, and could be related. I went through pages of weird pictures on their social media accounts that seemed to have no direct connection.</p>

<p>None of this, not a single bit of it, comes close the scientific and structural engineering inconsistencies of the 9/11 commission report - a real conspiracy. Not a far fetched political narrative like you all seem to be pushing.</p>

<p>Do child sex rings and secret pedofile groups exist? Yes. Could they involve high ranking government officials? Absolutely. Does the evidence produced by the PG conspiracy prove any of it? Not even remotely.</p>

<p>I tried to do a fair amount of research on PG before denouncing it, but if I have it wrong, please enlighten me with some facts.</p>

<p>I think the sentiment so far is that &quot;theres SOMETHING going on, which we would have never been clued into if those emails weren&#39;t leaked, there are more pieces to the puzzle they just need to be found.&quot;</p>

<p>This is also something many have been (more broadly) alleging for years now, and we finally have a few more specific strings to start pulling and seeing the evidence of that segment of elite scrambling to shut this down is validating the movement and giving it drive to keep pushing</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So if you are wanting to out the truth, now it&#39;s your turn to do some research now that I&#39;ve given you a solid starting point. Or are you just going to keep denying it and say this isn&#39;t evidence?</p>

<p>I&#39;d rather not waste my time with you because I know even if I present a pile of &quot;evidence&quot; you will say it&#39;s not good enough. You are either unwilling to open your eyes, or you clearly have alterior motives. (meaning you do not want the truth to come out for whatever agenda.). I&#39;ll assume you have good scrupulous intentions so am providing some sources here.</p>

<p>All these sources are in addition to the established fact that Hillary Clinton got Laura Silsby pardoned after she got caught smuggling 33 children out of Haiti. Why do you think the CF was in Haiti and burned <a href="http://www.freerepublic.com/focus/news/3270263/posts">billions</a>? And an important prosecutor in the DOJ - Ruo - was also caught showing interest in sick instagram images. The Podesta brothers clearly have a sick interest in spirit cooking (see wikileaks email) and related art, while they show an uncanny resemblance to Madeline McCann&#39;s kidnappers.</p>

<p> </p>

<p><em>Extra sources you probably want to ignore:</em></p>

<p>Michael Aquino is a satanist who is now being exposed as being a long time pedophile, involved with the military, CIA, Bush Senior and top level politicians in many nations on earth.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t think satanists are bad so long as they are getting consent. A dictator like Mugabe is different. He is doing the opposite of dictating by consent. Some people want to see mass murders, but I don&#39;t think all satanists would want this.</p>

It could very well be a distraction, like say Alefantis is part of a ring, and that&#39;s why he likes the dirty rock concerts there, but at the same time doesn&#39;t actually do anything illegal at Comet.  Just an arbitrary theory, but at this point there is no proof of any illegal activity here.  One further: If there ever was, they surely stopped once they got the spotlight and went elsewhere.</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>TALK ABOUT IT!</strong>
From all the money they&#39;re pouring into shilling, they REALLY don&#39;t want us to talk about it. Its important to spread the message online but don&#39;t forget about talking about it to friends and family irl! I&#39;m a college student so many of my friends are college educated,  and I have yet explain pizzagate to someone who straight up refuses to believe there&#39;s anything suspicious. The CTR wants you to believe your silly conspiracy theories will be mocked and laughed at, BUT THIS IS NOT THE CASE! </p></li>
<li><p><strong>JOIN THE FIGHT!</strong>
It has been very clear now that conspiracy has been fighting against an onslaught of shills from the elites. Simply calling someone a shill does not help our case. <strong>FIGHT THEM</strong> argue with them until your blue in the face! Don&#39;t let even a single post  trying to discredit our investigation left unrefuted. Lurkers will read every comment and see our truth everytime these shills try to cover this shit up. </p></li>
</ul>

<p>Be <strong>RELENTLESS!!</strong></p>

<p>I don&#39;t think a coward would be openly supporting a conspiracy theory that the media is trying to turn the entire world against. Standing up to the mainstream media and the elite that govern it is not something a coward would do. You don&#39;t think I&#39;ve encountered people in real life who has already succumbed to the fake news narrative? That doesn&#39;t stop me from spreading pizzagate. </p>

<p>A REAL coward would allow himself to be bribed into defending these sick fucks. How much money did it take for you to completely abandon your morals? You shills make me so fucking sick. Don&#39;t dare call me a coward and a liar when you yourself a filthy sell out. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>YES! </p>

<p>PLEASE SPREAD THIS </p>

<p>Pizzagate IS NOT comet pizza and Alefantis. 
Pizzagate is the realization and potential understanding of how the ruling elite operate, what they are willing to do to hide opposition, and the fact that the US government very well may be extremely close to child trafficking found in numerous other countries abroad.</p>

<p>Those speaking up against it are almost already a lost cause. the ones on the sidelines. The one still wondering. The ones across the world who understand how the globalists work. These are the people we need to influence. Not the literal shills who shill without even knowing it. At least tv pundits get paid millions of dollars. The idiots trolling us are doing it for free and think it&#39;s because they are patriotic.</p>

<p>Keep in mind, this isnt a pro or anti homosexuality argument. I&#39;m sure vulnerability to Barbarian hordes wasn&#39;t dependent on how individuals preferred their sex. If their leaders aren&#39;t focused on leading though, they&#39;ll eventually be lead to their destruction. The motivation largely doesn&#39;t matter, but to dismiss it entirely because it&#39;s not PC is rather silly.</p>

<p>Its not ridiculous to say that this shift in culture lead to a more passive stance of their military, leading to defense vulnerabilities they hadn&#39;t previously had to deal with. I can guarantee you their citizens weren&#39;t happy about that.</p>
