    <div class="md"><p>Yes. The MIC needed entry into a war that was seen as unfavorable by much of the population at the time. Nothing to rile up the populace like a foreign attack on citizens.</p>

<p>It worked with the USS Maine, the Reichstag fire, and later, the Gulf of Tonkin, and the Twin Towers (all three of them). In the early 60s, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Lyman Lemnitzer proposed a similar attack on the US using Cubans as patsies, and was removed from his post by Kennedy. This may or may not have played into Kennedy&#39;s subsequent assassination.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>FDR&#39;s administration provoked Japan by imposing an oil embargo against them in the months before the attack because of Japan&#39;s agression in China. Immediatley before that the US was still selling Japan scrap metal and other items vital to war industries. Japan saw the embargo as an exsistential threat as they do not have oil or steel resourses, hence thay planned to knock down the US long enough to secure other supplies from indonesia and India. FDR probably knew that the embargo would eventually result in war, but maybe Japan would back down. 
To say that the December 7 attack was a false flag, as has been becomming more common in the last 30 years, is almost certainly wrong. In hindsight the US should have been on higher alert. The Japanese prepared very thoroughly for this and the other December attacks in the Philipines , Hong Kong, and most shocking Singapores fall. That the US was able to turn this around in less than one year, at Coral Sea, Midway and Guadalcanal, is an astonishing accomplishment of brains and bravery, not becuse we knew we were going to win, and spotted the Japanese 11 battleships on purpose. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It makes the attack of December 7 less outrageous so it sort of disapeared. At the end of the day, the Japanese were following a plan of conquest and the oil embargo triggered the wider plan earlier than they had planned.

    <div class="md"><p>You are right, it was mainly air to sea torpedoes.</p>

<p>They thought Pearl Harbor was safe because they were in shallow water (about 40ft) and this tactic would not work due to torpedoes sinking. </p>

<p>But with the innovation of adding wooden fins, the torpedo would skim on top of the water and still be effective in shallow water.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes. Not least because the attack on Pearl Harbour was almost the same as the attack on Port Arthur 40 years earlier. Americans are obsessed by the 7th of December, ignoring where the dateline is and the fact that Japan invaded half a dozen countries <em>that day</em>. The Philippines was American territory in 1941 and was attacked several hours ahead of Pearl Harbour (IIRC Guam and/or Midway was attacked earlier, too), it just happened on the other side of the date line, on the 8th.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Assume this is true, that they did know..... what are you suggesting have been done? </p>

<p>Attack Japan unprovoked? OK, now you&#39;re the bad guys and you have no allies. </p>

<p>Put more defense in Pearl Harbour? The entire fleet was there in defence. The attack didn&#39;t do THAT much damage considering it was supposed to knock America out of the war. </p>

<p>Are you suggesting they wanted to get extra hurt so they could get extra sympathy and so more case to go to war? Any attack AT ALL would have given them the same justification, the scale of damage was irrelevant. And allowing more damage could easily have ACTUALLY knocked them out of the war, so why would they have allowed more damage on their ENTIRE Pacific fleet than needed?</p>

<p>I&#39;m not sure what you&#39;re suggesting the conspiracy would have been if they did know, or how their behaviour could have changed.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>Attack Japan unprovoked?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Nope, but you could have had your fleet at sea on war alert ready to defend the island, rather than tied up in docks like sitting targets.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Put more defense in Pearl Harbour? The entire fleet was there in defence.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You could have at least alerted the defence, so that guns were manned and ready to go into action... but instead half the crews were on shore leave and had to be recalled during the attack.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The attack didn&#39;t do THAT much damage considering it was supposed to knock America out of the war.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Which itself is strong evidence... the obsolete battleships were sitting targets lined up in rows, while the entire carrier fleet was safely out at sea doing nothing to defend the island.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Are you suggesting they wanted to get extra hurt so they could get extra sympathy and so more case to go to war? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>When over 80% of the population were against getting involved in a foreign war, the leaders who privately wanted to join the war had to do something that would swing public opinion massively in favour of it. A &quot;Sneak attack&quot; that killed thousands did the job nicely.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Any attack AT ALL would have given them the same justification, the scale of damage was irrelevant.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Not really. Any attack that failed to hit American soil because it was stopped at sea hundreds of miles away would have had much less effect on public opinion. It would have been easy for some to claim the US &quot;fired first&quot;.</p>

<p>The scale of the attack was not relevant... what mattered is that it be a successful &quot;sneak attack&quot; on a sleeping US. It wouldn&#39;t have mattered if it was ten planes or a hundred planes, so long as they dropped their bombs on US soil. But the Japanese chose how large the attack was, not the US... the US just let them carry it out successfully.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>And allowing more damage could easily have ACTUALLY knocked them out of the war</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Nope. With the carriers safely out of harm&#39;s way, the Japanese attack had no chance of doing that kind of damage to the US navy.</p>

<p>The only damage done was done to obsolete aircraft and ships that would not have survived long during the war, anyway.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I&#39;m not sure what you&#39;re suggesting the conspiracy would have been if they did know, or how their behaviour could have changed.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>They definitely knew. There is no doubt at all about that.</p>

<p>As for a change of behaviour... if they had wanted to protect the Pacific Fleet - or at least the obsolete portions of it that were destroyed at Pearl Harbor - they would have recalled the crews and sent the ships to sea where they could be under way, fully manned and far less vulnerable... just like the carriers were. Not a single carrier was hit that day, because they weren&#39;t there.</p>

<p>Thousands of men would have survived that day if they had been at sea on alert rather than tied up as sacrificial lambs for the bombers.</p>
