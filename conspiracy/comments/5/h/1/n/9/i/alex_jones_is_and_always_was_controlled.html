    <div class="md"><p>&quot;Always was&quot;  I disagree.</p>

<p>I do think that there is something behind the scenes with Jones now, but here is how I see his devolvement:</p>

<p>1) Starts out young, fresh, rough on the edges, but decent at presenting information</p>

<p>2) Gets hooked on evil elite stuff, still shooting at 95% accuracy with his reporting.</p>

<p>3) His Bohemian Grove documentary blows up, makes him a household name for a while, making good traction now that he has proof of some of this fucked up shit</p>

<p>4) After that, media organizes around him to spin him has a crazy conspiracy theorist.</p>

<p>5) Because we had no means to organize or to fight propaganda (see: no internet), people start losing trust in him because of this media effort</p>

<p>6) Over time, becomes crazier and crazier as he has to deal with the entire media/culture calling him crazy even though he is <em>mostly</em> right.  Starts shooting at 70% accuracy.</p>

<p>7) More years pass, nothing happens with the things he proves, and this drives him crazier. Perhaps this is when the media has cozied up with him for him to be controlled op. now that they&#39;ve weakened him.</p>

<p>8) Now, is actively spinning factual stories with falsehoods in order to take the steam out of big events.  Maybe he&#39;s not even aware of it.  Now he&#39;s at barely 50% accuracy.  &lt;-------<strong>We are here</strong></p>

    <div class="md"><p>He &quot;seems&quot; more authentic because he has more funding, but there&#39;s no contest in my eyes.  </p>

<p>Look up any clip of him within the past 5 years and compare it to Alex from his <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpKdSvwYsrE">Bohemian Grove documentary</a>.  It&#39;s not even a contest, my friend.  </p>

<p>Ultimately we agree.  I just think he was authentic at one point.</p>

<li><p>Alex Jones has a Jewish wife named Kelly Rebecca Nichols, and he has three children with her. 
(Why is this significant? You couldn&#39;t even provide good enough proof that you resorted to say he has a wife with three children?)</p></li>
<li><p>Alex Jones and his Jewish wife and children all qualify for Israeli citizenship under Israel&#39;s &quot;Law of Return&quot;. 
(With your logic any single American married to a Jewish woman in the entire country is qualified for Israeli citizenship under Israeli&#39;s &quot;Law of Return&quot; and therefore is corrupt) </p></li>
<li><p>Alex Jones has dozens of Jewish sponsors and advertisers that financially support his radio show and websites. (Why is it signigifant that they are Jewish? Are you prejudice against Jews?) 
(Can you name the dozens of Jewish sponsors and advertisers who financially support is radio show? Are you suggesting that without these dozens of Jewish sponsors &amp; advertisers allegedly supporting AJ&#39;s radio show that his show would not be able to broadcast because he relies solely on these Jewish supporters?)</p></li>
<li><p>Alex Jones&#39; flagship radio station, KLBJ AM, in Austin, Texas, is owned by Emmis Communications, a media conglomerate based in Indianapolis, Indiana. The founder, chairman, president, and CEO of Emmis Communications is the dual Israeli citizen Zionist Jew Jeffrey H. Smulyan. 
(Uh, wait so AJ broadcasts on hundreds of radio station across the country BUT there is this ONE station that Alex broadcasts on in Texas and that radio station is owned by a JEW so Alex Jones must be in the illumaniti! Confirmed.)</p></li>

<p>I would go on but your reasons are pathetic</p>
