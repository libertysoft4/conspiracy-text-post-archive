What evidence could come forward to prove the conspiracy to be false in your mind?  What action would have to take place to satisfy your concerns?</p>

<p>The opposite side of the argument seems to want definitive evidence to fully believe that something is going on.  So I am curious about the flip-side to the issue.</p>

<p>Edit: I wanted to discuss how this conspiracy could be disproved in the eyes of the skeptics, however a lot of this thread is related to specific evidence and how if that was shown to be wrong/irrelevant they may change their mind.  I went ahead and posted a response to this <a href="https://i.sli.mg/eoWIeB.jpg">image</a> of some of the compiled evidence.  You can find it down in the comments <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/5h8lks/pizzagate_believers_what_would_it_take_for_you_to/daywmhh/">here</a>. I would appreciate it if people took the time to read it(I know it&#39;s a lot but there was a lot in that image)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Truth be told, the biggest problem is that news sources cannot be trusted.</p>

<p>Large scale news organizations rarely do their own reporting anymore - they get scripts with the majority of the information already in it from the large news houses, and they merely read what is there.</p>

<p>If you listen to JFK&#39;s last speech, he talks greatly about the need of the media to self sensor in how it provides information, since global broadcasts means that anyone can listen in.  Fast forwards to BUSH2 administration, which, when asked if it&#39;s ethical to have news stories that are written by the government with propaganda in mind be shown on TV without any disclosure of who funded it, Bush simply said &quot;there is nothing illegal about it according to the justice department&quot;. That signaled the death of normalization of propaganda, because now one could not tell the difference between what is actual reporting to that which was just a party release. </p>

<hr/>

<p>At the other end of the spectrum, those &quot;regular people&quot; who do their own investigation and post it online cannot be trusted either. They often jump to wild conclusions, lack in logic, and misrepresent information. They chain together events which may or may not be related, and often use the same scare tactics - emotional response - as the mainstream media.</p>

<hr/>

<p>All news has spin. Check out some of Adam Curtis&#39; documentaries about the history of the news, and how it&#39;s usage has changed from being one that reports on events to one that creates events. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t know if such a thing is actually possible.</p>

<p>People have different thresholds for what they consider &quot;reliable&quot;. For many people, so long as it&#39;s on TV or the paper it means it&#39;s reliable. For others, the bar is much higher. This bar does have an upper limit though - the problem is that to truly reach it means that you have only verified the truth of the matter to yourself, and not to others.</p>

<p>It&#39;s not just about how vigorously the facts are researched and organized, but about what direction is taken when they travel through the web of facts, and what kind of story is developed from that path.</p>

<p>If you&#39;ve ever watched any of the James Burke &quot;connections&quot; series, he talks greatly about this concept, that there are a huge number of ways that events interact with each other, but ultimately we choose a certain path to traverse them in order to make a story. The reality is that causality is not merely one thing leads to another, but rather one web of things influences all other webs that are related to it in chaotic and unpredictable ways. In the end, we simplify this as to tell a story that is easy to follow.</p>

<p>Trust, once eroded, needs more than just what it had before to rebuild it. </p>

<p>One of the largest things that we are battling nowadays is that facts cannot be trusted anymore. It&#39;s one things to disagree with the narrative of the media, that is obvious - but with changes in technology we cannot even trust things that we see with our own eyes. So a video of so-and-so saying whatever they are saying can be done with CG and no one can tell the difference. Emails can be released by supposed &quot;bulletproof&quot; organizations, but then later we find out they are not so &quot;bulletproof&quot; (wikileaks). </p>

<p>I think its perfectly reasonable to realize that no person or organization is trustworthy enough to report on actual events without having an agenda of their own.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thank you for the response.  That is what I am afraid of.  I was hoping this thread would help shed some light on how fervent the belief is.  I assumed people are open to counter-evidence and would not try to take action against those they suspect personally.  It is scary that it has reached the point that people are willing to endanger themselves and others in order to search for new evidence.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Who to trust... that&#39;s probably the hardest question. I&#39;m no expert here. But considering what we know about the Catholic Church, the military, residential schools, Britain generally, Australia, Thailand, I mean it&#39;s a global phenomenon not unique to Washington. And we shouldn&#39;t be surprised that DC power is involved. We need a special prosecutor, but I don&#39;t see that happening without popular protest.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well other child trafficking cases get investigated.  Why now is there only citizen investigation into this?   We have a different approach to crime solving now with the vast array of information available and it takes intuition to make connections while they hide things in plain sight.  </p>

<p>Either we figure out a way to go after the true culprits or we keep sweeping it away giving them cover.  I think we all need to stop making up our minds about truth and acknowledge that we only get tiny amounts of information so we shouldn&#39;t 
 be calling the shots on innocence or guilt.  </p>

<p>If there is implied crime it should be investigated regardless of who it implies.  If you post lewd photographs and build the environment that could be imagined as a cover then you should deal with the repercussions.  </p>

</blockquote>

<p>Isn&#39;t that an incredibly dangerous attitude? Isn&#39;t that what an investigation is about? the truth?  Random people on the internet, finding very weak connections and evidence, should be in charge of who is guilty and who is not? What kind of society would that be?  Should you voice your opinion and try to have action taken to investigate? Absolutely.  But to say that you should be the one to decide is outrageous.</p>

<p>Other cases are investigated because the evidence is much stronger.  People show other cases of high level politicians being involved in such things as evidence that this is possible. But isn&#39;t the fact that these cases were discovered and people prosecuted prove the fact that these cases can be handled?  I am fine with the search for evidence, but to say we should stop trying to &quot;make up our minds about the truth&quot; is incredibly irresponsible.</p>

<p>Are lewd photographs illegal? Which photographs are you referencing?  If they have children in them you can report them and they will definitely have action taken against them.</p>

<p>But it&#39;s not like Podesta has off the record meetings with reporters at his house, oh wait Wikileaks showed us he does. Journalists would never collude with Podesta, oh wait Wikileaks showed them sending their stories to Podesta for approval before publication. </p>

<p>I&#39;m not sure what&#39;s going on exactly, but I know there are a lot of rich and powerful people who want people to stop looking at this as soon as possible. If there wasn&#39;t something they wanted to hide they wouldn&#39;t be trying so hard to make us stop looking. </p>

Also weird that the lady who emailed him has a blog where people pay to watch kids on camera,&quot;raw and uncut&quot;. Fuck all the codes, this crazy bitch brand 3 children for Podesta&#39;s entertainment. like what the actual fuck?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Something is definitely wrong in the state of Denmark, as they say. There is too many unusual occurrences going on surrounding the Clintons, the DNC, and Clinton Foundation. It may not be a satanic child sex ring... but it might be. </p>

<p>If it&#39;s not, something else incredibly suspicious is going on to the point where the entire MSM and cohorts of democratic politicos are moving against p-gate. The MSM has created the phantom of Fake News and Russian espionage to try and derail p-gate and Wikileaks. Also, there reeks of a desperate push to get Clinton into office...still... a full month after the election. Someone is funding Stein&#39;s attempt of a recount. It also appears CTR is still operating full force here, on voat, and on the chans. </p>

<p>Something is up, and it&#39;s not good. If it isn&#39;t p-gate it might be something much worse and the p-gate movement is creating unwanted attention and pressure on people who really REALLY don&#39;t want it.</p>

I understand a lot of people have high suspicions of wrong doing, but how can these suspicions be put to rest?  The opposite side would obviously change their mind if hard evidence was presented.  On the suspicious side, who we assume believe it to be true to some degree, what would it take to disprove it in your eyes?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>An actual investigation by an agency not clearly compromised by the people being investigated. Maybe avoiding things like clandestine meetings on runways while investigations are active might actually lead to some credibility when findings are announced.</p>

<p>If you want to really settle this, then appointing a prosecutor who would aggressively investigate and indict would be a great starting point. Actively prosecuting and convicting those guilty of crimes related and unrelated would also likely add to the credibility of the investigation. Transparency on the investigation would also help.  </p>

<p>If such an aggressively and transparently pursued investigation were to occur then I personally would be willing to put the whole thing to rest.</p>

<p>Now.. let me ask you a question in return... what do you think the odds are such an investigation will ever occur would be?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think the most important thing about &quot;who&quot; is that they carry legitimacy and have the confidence of the public. Likely a proven track record of some kind, whether it&#39;s a private sector record or public sector one. The most important thing is that they have demonstrated repeated honesty and trustworthiness.</p>

<p>I nothing is found then nothing is found. Pure and simple. If the prosecutor is trustworthy enough and has been diligent enough in their investigations then the public with rest easy knowing the job was done right. </p>

<p>On a side note, I think it&#39;s important to point out that any investigation should most definitely <strong>not</strong> be limited to democrats and the dnc only. If the stink leads to republicans, greens, or libertarians they need to get taken out also. The scope of the investigation should also not be limited by rank. In order to achieve pure legitimacy congress, sentate and POTUS should <strong>all</strong> be subject to investigation.</p>

<p>There has been far too many investigations into child abuse in government simply covered up. Look back to the Franklin incident and Call-Boy Scandal and follow the trail of filth all the way up to Operation Flicker. Also check out the UK with Operation Yewtree and Operation Hydrant. Compare the investigations on how Hydrant vs. Flicker were carried out. It&#39;s shameful and disgusting that we keep failing to prosecute. Even Hydrant in the UK has issues of cover-up coming to light.</p>

<p>So, I&#39;m going to ask again... Given the pathetic track record we have, and the obvious scale and effectiveness the perpetrators have covering their tracks in Washington.... What do you honestly think the likelihood of getting even a partially legitimate investigation going would be?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think if any strong evidence was found it would lead to an investigation. Based on what has been found so far it doesn&#39;t seem to be a solid case.  Some of the&quot;evidence&quot; others have posted in this thread and elsewhere discredits the legitimacy of the investigation. If a person told you their neighbor murdered someone and you asked for evidence and they said they were listening to their phone calls and they were talking about pizza which is a secret code; would you believe them? You may not agree that is there case here but that is how the non-conspiracy people feel.  People are looking and accepting anything that could possibly be a sign of some kind of strange behavior. If real evidence that clearly pointed to wrong doing was found, I believe there would be an investigation. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, here is the thing..... One of the important things Comey said when he re-opened the email case a few weeks ago is that &quot;the FBI does not discuss or disclose active investigations.&quot; I personally took this to mean that there <em>could</em> be one or more other investigations regarding Clinton or the DNC which the FBI is not discussing. Comey also said that the emails did not change their opinion on the <em>email investigation</em>. Did it change their mind on other investigations?</p>

<p>It&#39;s entirely possible that they could already be investigating child abuse and human trafficking tied to the DNC, but simply are not telling us in order to keep the investigation procedurally &quot;clean&quot;. It was, after all, the NYPD-SVU that found the emails from Weiners computer that got sent to the FBI. This means there is a good chance they are also relevant to SVU investigations. </p>

<p>If that is the case, then discoveries and leads PG8 finds only help any active FBI investigation. Sure, most things discovered on the internet may not be super important to us on reddit and voat, but our discoveries may add to physical evidence the FBI already has. The advantage to a hive mind of citizen investigators is that it gets research on lots and lots of rabbit holes the FBI may not have the time or resources to look at. Using reddit/voat allows us to look at a lot of the bullshit and the FBI can cherry pick what they think is important based on evidence they already have that we don&#39;t know about. They can then take that evidence and do real things with it.</p>

<p>You may ask me next; &quot;Why doesn&#39;t the FBI just charge everyone if they have all this indictable evidence?&quot; The answer is, Trump isn&#39;t president yet. If the FBI, CIA, NSA or NYPD lay <strong>any</strong> charges right now it gives the opportunity for Obama to pardon the charged person. A single charge would let the cat out of the bag that the FBI is investigating a specific issue, and all those not already charged will know the jig is up and start cleaning evidence. Right now, the perps don&#39;t know who is being looked at and who is the biggest risks, and who needs to be suicided before it&#39;s too late. It&#39;s the same reason they don&#39;t arrest a single mafia guy if they are planning on taking down an entire family. </p>

<p>My bet is this.... Come January 21 the FBI (and others) will be let off the leash and you will start to see heads roll. How far up the seniority list the heads rolling will be is anyone&#39;s guess. We will find out who and what the FBI (and others) are after and the chance for pardon by friendlies is going to be gone.</p>

<p>As for the question I&#39;ve asked twice... Allow me to answer that one for you too... The odds of a fair, balanced, non-partisan investigation that will go after all shitty ass perpetrators regardless of political affiliation and led by an aggressive prosecutor everyone can agree will be fair is.... <strong>Zero.</strong> And that fucking sucks. In a nation with the population the size of the USA it&#39;s fucking pathetic that we won&#39;t be able to find a single person capable of pursuing and charging child molesting politicians that everyone can agree won&#39;t fuck it up and sell out. What does that say about us as a nation? So another reason PG8 is alive and growing is because we are sick of seeing these fucks go free when we rely on our government to protect us, and instead we&#39;ve just decided to do it on our own. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I understand where you are coming from, and I wish that were the case.  There definitely could be or could have been an investigation into the claims pizzagate is making.  I do not think that the internet is really helping with this if it is an investigation.  All pizzagate is doing is drawing attention to all of these things, where if they were really being investigated by a professional and skilled group, things would be done more carefully. I see a lot of pizzagate claims of things being changed after they discovered them and so that is proof of wrong doing.  If it really is, then wouldn&#39;t it have been better not to give it away that you were on to them? If you really believe what you said then can you accept the possibility that the internet&#39;s involvement is only interfering with the proper investigation?</p>

<p>You also have a lot of faith in Trump to handle this situation.  Isn&#39;t Trump part of this elite class? Did he not have a relationship with Epstein?  Was there not a woman who claimed he raped her as a child?  If you  look at the situation from a neutral perspective, what is it about Trump that makes him different? You don&#39;t think Trump has anything to hide?</p>

<p>People wish things were more interesting than they are.  Someone suggests a secret sex code based around pizza and things fly off the handle.  All based on the fact that the emails talked about pizza related to events in which they served pizza?  Pizzagate believers want to tear the lives of the people they suspect apart.  A lot of them seem to want them locked up right now without any real evidence.  People want so badly for this to be true and for them to be able to help that they will spin things whatever way they have to to make this work.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>We will just have to agree to disagree about the PG8 investigation and it&#39;s value to any ongoing investigation by officials. </p>

<p>I think you&#39;re making a mistake thinking I have a partisan opinion in this. I didn&#39;t say I had any faith in Trump to handle this properly I  said that we are in a holding pattern until he becomes president so we don&#39;t lose any fish to a pardon. I actually said that there is <strong>zero</strong> chance this will be handled properly. I doubt any republicans will go down once he swears in, but if we can at least take out the cancer in the democrats then half of the tumor will be gone.</p>

<p>To risk coming to Trumps defense, he at least provides the best statistical chance of handling this at all. There was no chance of getting an investigation with Clinton, considering her and her party boy husband are at the very center of anything going on. Jill Stein has shown herself to be a tool of either the democrats, or at least Soros. Gary Johnson? Oh god... can he even find his shoes, much less Aleppo?</p>

<p>Yes he had a relationship with Epstein, but he also banned Epstein from his club when he caught him hitting on young girls. Also, the girl pressing the charges &quot;Katie Johnson&quot; is not mentioned in either the black book, flight logs, or case brought by Virginia Roberts, so her relationship with Epstein is dubious to begin with. She has dropped her suit more than once, and most recently even failed to show up to file the latest suit. According to the <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3914012/Troubled-woman-history-drug-use-claimed-assaulted-Donald-Trump-Jeffrey-Epstein-sex-party-age-13-FABRICATED-story.html">Daily Mail they have a source close to her saying she had made then entire story up</a>. Unfortunately the Daily Mail is a huge manufacturer of &quot;fake news&quot; so who knows how valid that is? Finally, if there was <strong>any</strong> credible evidence of Trump molesting a 13 year old why was he not charged alongside Epstein during the original 2006 investigation? Also, why did he volunteer to testify on behalf of Virginia Roberts in 2010? Surely not the actions of a guilty child molester.... </p>

<p>You are making assumptions I can&#39;t look at this from a neutral perspective, but you are very wrong in that idea. I had earlier said that the ideal investigation should include investigations of congress, senate, and POTUS. I wasn&#39;t referring to the current POTUS Obama alone any future POTUS also. If a real investigation was to implicate Trump then he should burn also. I couldn&#39;t give a shit what party, sex, or orientation the person is. I fully believe that if someone is guilty of molesting or torturing a child they should burn. Don&#39;t you?</p>

<p>If you think the PG8 thing is simply about emails, code words and funny pictures, you are revealing a level of ignorance of the subject that I&#39;m beginning to find a little annoying. This issue isn&#39;t limited to Comet Ping Pong and a couple of freaky weird artists. Look into the systemic problem of child molestation concerning the elite. Look at whats been going on in Washington and then start looking at the problem nationally. If you aren&#39;t puking your lunch by that point start taking a look at the problem internationally. If you don&#39;t see a trend of political elite fucking little children and getting away with it, then you are simply ignoring it intentionally. Pizzagate is simply the latest weak link in the chain that has been discovered.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not going to spoon feed you the resources for research, because the red-pill effect you will experience is more earth shattering if you discover the scale of the problem on your own. </p>

<p>And as for the poor lives of those involved... fuck them. Even if they are innocent of the claims of child molestation there is actually consequences socially when you have fucked up art parties and entertain the ideas of diddling children on your Instagram. There is consequences when the art you hang on your wall celebrates the torture and abuse of children and women. Finally there is consequences when you see these things at your place of work or in your social circle and you let it all slip by without questioning it. The shit the Podestas and CPP employees entertain is <em>not</em> ok, and this is now the price they pay whether they are guilty of worse or not.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s okay, I understand people are passionate about this issue and I&#39;m sure my tone was rough in some of my comments. It&#39;s not that I&#39;m not open to the idea of high level trafficking and abuse, as it has been proven to happen. My issue lies in the fact that a lot of the origins for this specific conspiracy come from the assumption of guilt and misdeeds. I really don&#39;t believe the code or that the pictures are this horrible thing.  I feel as though my explanations for a lot of the evidence presented to me is fair and logical. It is a very serious allegation to accuse people of and so I believe stronger evidence is needed.  Pizzagate began with the comet pizza and the emails, which I don&#39;t believe to be indicative of anything. I think most people saw these emails and pictures as they were told to. To look at it neutrally you have to ignore the idea of codes and think can it be explained more simply and rationally. I believe it can. I hope that you or I are never accused of something so serious based on such weak evidence. Basically anything people say can be made to be code if you want it to be. I know you see a lot of other connections but I can&#39;t yet agree.  Nobody deserves to be accused and convicted of a crime they didn&#39;t commit. Innocent until proven guilty. I&#39;m sure that&#39;s what you&#39;re trying to do but a lot of people are trying to ignore that and have completely made up their minds on the issue.  For the most part I am fine with people investigating as long as they reasonable about what they consider evidence and that they do their investigation legally. The passion and certainty of a lot of believers is what lead to the recent gunman(I know a lot of people think it was a false flag but I think it is completely reasonable to assume he was for real). It&#39;s not worth risking innocent lives for a truth that may not exist.  If future evidence is found that is more definitive I would definitely change my mind.  Obviously I care about children and rescuing those in these kinds of situations but I feel if people are this passionate they should work on being trained and joining groups that are going after more definite cases. I really appreciate you taking the time to discuss this and I do feel I better understand the other side. Several people in this thread have been very reasonable, you included.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thank you for being reasonable also! </p>

<p>If I can make a final comment, I agree that pizzagate <em>on its own</em> has some pretty weak evidence. However, when you considered within the whole it takes on a very very different aspect. Consider the Podestas art interest, then their connections to Clement Freud and the Portugal aspect, then how this ties in with the Clinton Foundations and their suspected child trafficking (see Monica Peterson), then the Clinton Foundations connections to Jay Stephens (re;Call Boy Scandal), and so on and so on. There is too many connections to be made that lead to a very dark corner of consideration that it simply can&#39;t be ignored. Once a concession is made that something hinky is going on, you can then look back at their ties to CPP and the frequency of their activities with CPP and the &quot;code language&quot; all takes on a different aspect. </p>

<p>I firmly believe we are just scratching the surface of something very terrible which had been going on and getting covered up for at least 25 or more years.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Okay lemme go through this:</p>

<p>1.) For the first set of emails referencing food.  People are making up the meaning behind the words.  You could assign any meaning to any word in any email, that doesn&#39;t make it true.  People are reading these emails with the assumption of a code and of child abuse and so you see more than what may be there.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>First email is about a handkerchief with pizza on it.  I don&#39;t see why that has to be weird.  Maybe strange that people have handkerchiefs but not that weird that there is pizza on it.  If you saw someone with pizza on their shirt or backpack or hat you wouldn&#39;t assume it was code or that they were a pedophile.</p></li>
<li><p>To me this email seems to say that their friend sent them a gift box of cheese when normally they send pasta and sauce.  Could be someone close by who sends it fresh, or it could be a long distance package with uncooked/packaged food.  They are going to share it with their family and they thank them.  Apparently they have traditionally played dominoes on the box that was sent to them, maybe when they get together?  Not the easiest to understand but when people discuss their own business there will be some references you don&#39;t fully understand. I think this explanation makes a lot more sense than talking about abusing children. I really don&#39;t understand why this one is so weird.</p></li>
<li><p>Clearly complaining about something work related. Do I understand what exactly is going on? Not really, but it seems pretty normal.  Apparently their friend has a hotdog stand in hawaii that they enjoy.  Is that really suspicious?</p></li>
<li><p>They talked about how someone could cook, and that they made pasta with a walnut sauce.  They wanted to know if the sauce was good, as walnut is not a standard pasta sauce ingredient.  They said they would bring walnuts, maybe they live in an area where walnuts are harvested.  I have walnuts at christmas, I have had walnuts on a salad, am I a pedophile?</p></li>
<li><p>Obama had an event and brought in special pizza and hotdogs from chicago, a place known for pizza and hotdogs.  The cost was high because he flew it in and ordered a lot of food.  Person was asking if they ordered their food in the same way.</p></li>
<li><p>They are having an event at the restaurant, very large event(highly doubt they were abusing children and a public restaurant during the early evening)  The person they are talking to is going to have an event where they read at the local bookstore.  They are wondering if they would want to have a dinner after the event at their place.  Big or small is asking what kind of party.  Pretty clear cut.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>2.) Pedophile symbols:  Definitely weird that they had that symbol, does it mean they are pedophiles? I hope not, as a spiral triangle isn&#39;t that crazy and pizza is triangular so kinda makes sense. Also they <a href="https://plus.google.com/104873060669907951054">addressed</a> it on their google page.  <a href="http://www.snopes.com/code-for-pedophiles-on-toys/">Here</a> is a case of a symbol being used in a unrelated case.</p>

<p>3.) Instagram: </p>

<ul>
<li><p>Starting with the photos of the children, I don&#39;t see what so horrifying about them.  The girl with the tape is clearly happy, I highly doubt she is really trapped, she is playing along.  The baby is a baby. I don&#39;t know what I&#39;m supposed to be looking for.</p></li>
<li><p>The man in the photo is not the owner. <a href="http://www.metroweekly.com/2015/04/from-scratch-james-alefantis/">This</a> is a photo of James Aleftanis.  Also his shirt is referencing a region of d.c. named after <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierre_Charles_L&#x27;Enfant">this man</a></p></li>
</ul>

<p>4.) Strange posters: Are they strange posters? Yes. Are they artistic? Yes. Do they scream pedophilia? I don&#39;t think so.  The events are happening at 10pm so they are not for children. By all ages they mean there is no alcohol so people under 21 are allowed.  Do you really think they would put all ages to mean for people to bring children to abuse?</p>

<p>5.) Nearby businesses: There is nothing strange about the types of locations near by.  The symbol from the bistro does resemble to pedophilic symbol but is also a heart which is not a strange symbol for people to use.  They have probably taken it down for the same reason as besta pizza referenced above.</p>

<p>5.) Madeleine McCann: The photos shown are supposed to be the same suspect. Two people described the same man and they drew two different drawings. <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2013/oct/14/british-detectives-efits-madeleine-mccann-suspect">Source Here</a>.  It says that the Podestas were &quot;allegedly&quot; staying at this location.  According to who?</p>

<p>6.)Artwork: </p>

<ul>
<li><p>Clearly they have a weird taste in artwork. Art is definitely a strange thing and people can be interested in strange art without being pedophiles.  The painting hanging in his office is hard to see but does not scream pedophilia to me.  The hanging headless body is weird but again doesn&#39;t really suggest pedophilia.  The weird pictures after that are said to be in his home but I couldn&#39;t find any source on that.  They may be artwork of an artist enjoyed by Tony Podesta but I&#39;m not sure.  Here is an <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2004/apr/20/usa.world">article</a> discussing his passion for art. <a href="http://washingtonlife.com/2015/06/05/inside-homes-private-viewing/">Here</a> is another that references his favorite artists. Here are links to the artists: <a href="http://olafureliasson.net/archive/artwork">Olaf</a>, <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Marina+Abramovic+artwork&amp;amp;biw=1745&amp;amp;bih=920&amp;amp;source=lnms&amp;amp;tbm=isch&amp;amp;sa=X&amp;amp;ved=0ahUKEwiWo-CTiebQAhUqIcAKHYEID_AQ_AUICCgB">Marina Abromovic</a> who is the one people think is in on it, <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Antony+Gormley&amp;amp;source=lnms&amp;amp;tbm=isch&amp;amp;sa=X&amp;amp;ved=0ahUKEwih16qdhubQAhVJmBoKHdhzBNAQ_AUICCgB&amp;amp;biw=1745&amp;amp;bih=920#tbm=isch&amp;amp;q=Antony+Gormley+artwork">Antony Gormley</a>, <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Vik+Muniz+artwork&amp;amp;biw=1745&amp;amp;bih=920&amp;amp;source=lnms&amp;amp;tbm=isch&amp;amp;sa=X&amp;amp;ved=0ahUKEwj-lZbxhubQAhXLlxoKHbVjDbEQ_AUIBigB">Vic Muniz</a>, <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Bourgeois+artist+artwork&amp;amp;biw=1745&amp;amp;bih=920&amp;amp;source=lnms&amp;amp;tbm=isch&amp;amp;sa=X&amp;amp;ved=0ahUKEwjSyKfthubQAhUJSRoKHV1IC8oQ_AUIBigB">Some artist named bourgeois</a></p></li>
<li><p>I think the spirit cooking falls under this category as the one referenced in the email is related to the artist linked above. <a href="http://townhall.com/tipsheet/katiepavlich/2016/11/04/no-john-podestas-spirit-cooking-wasnt-above-devil-worship-n2241548">Here</a> is an article(I&#39;m sure people won&#39;t trust) explaining.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>7.) Epstein: A lot of people knew and spent time with Epstein. Should some of them be investigated? Probably, and it&#39;s possible they already have.  Should everyone who knew him be investigated as well as anyone connected to someone who knew him? The link seems to suggest that bill clinton knew epstein, so then hillary knew epstein, so then podesta knew epstein, and so comet pizza is an underground child sex ring. Nobody seems to be talking about how <a href="http://nymag.com/nymetro/news/people/n_7912/">Trump</a> knew and praised Epstein in the past.  I&#39;m sure most people who knew him did not realize what he was.</p>

<p>8.)Giustra: This one is weird seeing as I can&#39;t find the source of that image. <a href="http://radcliffefoundation.org/who-we-support/">Here</a> is a link to the foundation giustra founded. And <a href="https://www.facebook.com/pg/elpidafactory/photos/?ref=page_internal">Here</a> is the elpida organization mentioned, though I couldn&#39;t find the symbol as their logo, though the wall with artwork did contain the image and is from elpida.</p>

<p>9.)Silsby: She seems like shes got problems.  She could have been trying to traffic these kids, but seeing as she has an organization working to help children it is possible she was trying to help but is just an idiot.  I tried to find a source that Hillary had her released but I couldn&#39;t find it. <a href="https://wikileaks.org/clinton-emails/emailid/3465">Here</a> is the wikileaks that seems to suggest that, but I don&#39;t see that.  They also claim Hillary&#39;s association with Silsby is damning evidence even though they both worked in the business of helping children/orphans/refugees(clinton foundation).</p>

<p>10.) Missing person statistics: No idea where these numbers came from. I could not easily find a comparison of states in regards to missing children.  However I really don&#39;t think that is concrete evidence.</p>

<p>11.) The rest: Elites can get away with horrible things because they are powerful.  Definitely true but does not prove this case.</p>

<p>Phew. That was exhausting.  But when you look at all this evidence(based on the image linked) carefully the case seems to fall apart.  Maybe one or two of these things are weird but the majority are not, and seeing how this conspiracy depends on a lot of little weird things, I don&#39;t think there&#39;s much substance behind it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>1) It&#39;s entirely possible that all of these are misunderstood, but as a takeaway, it&#39;s weird that so many references to food seem out of place or are spoken about in ways I&#39;ve never heard someone talk about food.    It&#39;s not evidence, but it&#39;s &quot;worth noting&quot;</p>

<p>2) No rational person thinks that everyone who uses a symbol that resembles a pedophile symbol is a pedophile or involved in sex trafficking.  It&#39;s nothing more than the FBI telling us that pedophiles use that symbol, not that the symbol ALWAYS means pedophila. So, it&#39;s interesting in context, but not proof of anything by itself.</p>

<p>3)   What about this one? 
<a href="http://imgur.com/a/mLelx">http://imgur.com/a/mLelx</a></p>

<p>&quot;Yum.. baby. ?&quot;
&quot;#EdibleDc #baby #doublemayo&quot;
&quot;Time for baby to have own #babycaris.  Done&quot;</p>

<p>5) On 5-4 someone told podesta to have a safe trip, so he was going on vacation, somewhere.  We have no proof it was there though.</p>

<p>The sketches are supposedly of the same suspect, but the same investigators that produced them, also said they know who&#39;s responsible but they are unable to arrest the people due to international law.</p>

<p>So, it&#39;s POSSIBLE they released the sketches that match the podesta brothers perfectly, knowing there&#39;s nothing more they can do, and hoping people put it together.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8c3f26M8-Q">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8c3f26M8-Q</a></p>

<p>Again, not proof of anything, but a rather eerie coincidence. </p>

<p>Minor side note, Luxury houses bought May 1st of that year by podesta and alefantis/brock, days before this happened:
<a href="http://archive.is/RcTHx">http://archive.is/RcTHx</a></p>

<p>6)
a) artwork
I don&#39;t know specifically what pieces of art tony has other t han the hanging decapitated &quot;dahmer&quot; piece.  There is an article that says it&#39;s common for his art to make guests uncomfortable.  He also states his favorite artist in one article and that artist has many works that involve kids tied up, in their underwear, being punished.</p>

<p>From: <a href="https://archive.fo/vddrO#selection-3905.12-3913.74">https://archive.fo/vddrO#selection-3905.12-3913.74</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Folks attending a house tour in the Lake Barcroft neighborhood in Falls Church earlier this year got an eyeful when they walked into a bedroom at the Podesta residence hung with multiple color pictures by Katy Grannan, a photographer known for documentary-style pictures of naked teenagers in their parents&#39; suburban homes.</p>

<p>&quot;They were horrified,&quot; Heather recalls, a grin spreading across her face.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Also worth noting, the original article was removed shortly after this was discovered. </p>

<p>b) spirit cooking - the idea that &quot;there&#39;s no proof he went&quot; doesn&#39;t fly with me.  Tony podesta was invited and it didn&#39;t strike me something that was odd or unusual, or a rare invite (She didn&#39;t say, do you want to come to this thing I call spirit cooking , you can read about it here if you don&#39;t know what it is), so playing dumb here and acting like they both had no idea what it was and didn&#39;t go because they aren&#39;t into it, seems blatantly dishonest and evasive.  Tony also emailed John about it and didn&#39;t explain to him what spirit cooking is, so it would seem that it&#39;s completely known and normal in their circle.</p>

<p>Now, you can argue whether tony/johns intentions regarding this, or what it means when it&#39;s all said and done, but for most of us, spirit cooking is fucking weird, and very &quot;cult like&quot; and anyone who regularly engages in that type of thing, is on the weirder side of normal in my opinion.  I have a diverse group of friends, different genders, races, sexuality, and even some that are what I call &quot;horror fetishists&quot; and I can&#39;t picture any of them thinking this type of thing was normal art or &quot;no big deal&quot;.. </p>

<p>BUT,  I&#39;m also willing to dismiss this as &quot;just another oddity about these people&quot;</p>

<p>7) Epstein - 
No, associating with him doesn&#39;t make you guilty.  If one of my friends turns out to be a pedophile, that doesn&#39;t make me guilty.  However, Bill Clinton flying on his plane 26 times, and going OUT OF HIS WAY to DISMISS  his secret service, along with Hillary going 6 times.. I mean.. Come on.  Epstein was OPENLY and WELL KNOWN for being a pedophile and the Feds COVERED for him and his &quot;sentence&quot; was such a joke that it&#39;s not even questionable that something funny is going on.   And to suggest that there&#39;s nothing concerning that Bill Clinton went there 26 times, while he himself being quite the sexual deviant himself... Well, I&#39;m just going to completely disagree.  In my mind there&#39;s very little doubt that Clinton has engaged in sex with minors, but it&#39;s unlikely we&#39;ll ever be able to know or prove that definitively.</p>

<p>If trumps connections and interactions and behavior warrant us suspecting him, then so be it. This isn&#39;t about Trump, or Clinton directly, and we should investigate and follow the evidence where it leads.  He&#39;s not magically the good guy in all this just because it&#39;s directed towards people Clinton is associated with.</p>

<p>8) I haven&#39;t looked into this one much but I did see something that showed Elpida changed their logo shortly after this. Can&#39;t comment much more than that though.</p>

<p>9) Read this carefully about Silsby , every word of it:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>American journalist Anne-Christine d&#39;Adesky claims that she met Silsby the day before the missionaries&#39; entry into Haiti. The NLCR&#39;s leader explained that she had a letter from Dominican officials authorizing the transfer of orphans to the hotel in Cabarete. D&#39;Adesky warned Silsby that she also required proper paperwork from Haitian authorities.[6] On January 26, the group gathered forty children and set off for the Dominican Republic. They were stopped by a policeman, who explained that their actions were illegal. [7] [8] Undeterred the group set out to collect orphans from the devastated town of Calebasse (or Callabas) and from the slum of Le Citron in Port-au-Prince. [9] [10] 33 children (20 from Calebasse and 13 from Le Citron) were put under the mission&#39;s care. On the night of January 29, the missionaries were arrested while trying to cross the Dominican border without proper authorization. They denied any wrongdoing and maintained that they were doing God&#39;s will by helping orphaned victims of the quake. 
The children were sent to the SOS Children&#39;s Village orphanage in Croix-des-Bouquets, a suburb of Port-au-Prince, and it became clear that most (if not all) of them were not orphans.[12] NLCR missionaries maintained that they were told that the children were orphaned. In turn, people in Calebasse and SOS Children&#39;s Villages accused the missionaries of lying about their intentions.[9][12] Although the children&#39;s relatives were told that they would be able to visit them and eventually take them back, the NLCR&#39;s mission statement clearly outlined plans for adoption.[1][9]</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So, let&#39;s review this.  She was warned 24 hours prior that she had to have the proper paperwork or else they&#39;d be charged for trafficking, and she still tried to transport kids without the proper paperwork.  She claimed they were orphaned victims, but most of them weren&#39;t orphans.  The childrens relatives were told they would be able to visit them and take them back, but the NLCR had outlined their plans for adoption.</p>

<p>That&#39;s a very loaded piece of information, and while it&#39;s POSSIBLE that it&#39;s a misunderstanding, or misreported, it&#39;s very suspect.</p>

<p>10) I saw an entire thread of people using a website that had national stats and debating/discussing them. I didn&#39;t dig into it myself, because i dont feel like missing person numbers really prove or disprove anything, so I can&#39;t comment.</p>

<p>11) The child pornography investigation being dropped into the department of defense in 2011, DESPITE THEIR BEING EVIDENCE and 5200 people involved, is very telling that our government simply isn&#39;t interested in pursuing this.  The other part, is this is well documented as being covered up in regards to governments across the world.  We seem to continually dismiss it as not possible for whatever reason, but it would seem that it&#39;s not only possible, but likely to be occurring regularly.   I could elaborate on this one a lot, but I&#39;m tired of typing. :)</p>

<p>So, in summary, I agree with you that many of these things might just seem weird, or able to be explained away. But as the oddities pile up , you have to give serious thought to the idea that this might be possible.
Now I&#39;m not saying we should assume everyone is a pedophile who does anything weird, or that we should go and accuse these people or try to get them thrown in jail. but we shouldn&#39;t take so many coincidences lightly and we should, at a MINIMUM, not go around calling people bat shit crazy or lunatics for thinking that there might be something to all this.  In my opinion, we should keep digging and confirm that there&#39;s nothing before we dismiss it.</p>

<p>EDIT: Just want to add that I have a massive amount of links related to all this saved off. I could share more information if you&#39;re really interested, and I&#39;m not even trying to convince you to change your mind. I&#39;m only trying to get other people to understand why it&#39;s not easily dismissable for a lot of people, and it&#39;s got nothing to do with being conservative or alt-right or a conspiracy theorist (As of 2 months ago, i was the exact opposite of all of those).</p>

    <p class="byline text-muted mb-0"><a href="javascript:;" class="score"><span class="badge badge-secondary">1</span></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a class="author" href="../../../../../../../../user/Pillager.html">Pillager</a> 2016-12-08</p>
    <div class="md"><p>Thank you, I appreciate the reply and your willingness to discuss.</p>

<p>I&#39;ll focus on the new links and information you discussed.</p>

<p>1.) Photo of baby: I still don&#39;t really see the problem here.  The article was from edible magazine and there was a baby in the photo.  Joke being that the baby was edible.  &quot;Time for baby to have own #babycaris. Done&quot; is about the baby having their own hashtag. Apparently this baby is named caris and they created a hashtag for her. &quot;Done&quot; signified that they had made the hashtag.  It already feels wrong to even be talking about this baby as we don&#39;t know her or her family or even Alefantis.  No idea what #doublemayo is, but googling it didn&#39;t turn up anything weird, so probably an inside joke.</p>

<p>2.) McCAnn: Again very weak coincidences in relation to the podestas.  The fact that someone wished them a good trip(in the U.S.) a day <em>after</em> a girl(in portugal) goes missing doesn&#39;t mean anything.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>So, it&#39;s POSSIBLE they released the sketches that match the podesta brothers perfectly, knowing there&#39;s nothing more they can do, and hoping people put it together.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Seriously? The sketches were released in 2013. Why would anyone suspect the podestas? Who were they hoping would connect the dots?  The internet 3 years in a future by finding out about a secret pizza code? Again they were supposed to be two witness&#39;s recollection of the same man. Even more important is that the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2013/oct/14/british-detectives-efits-madeleine-mccann-suspect">sighting</a> of the man taking the child occurred on the night of the 3rd, the night she disappeared. You said the podesta happy trip wishing occurred on the 4th.</p>

<p>The Fox News video you posted said that an &quot;explosive new report&quot; says that the police know who did it. They then say that they believe it is a group of Portuguese thieves.  How does this connect to the podestas?  This seems to be more an issue about the difficulties of criminal matters across nations.  Also where is this report? <a href="http://insider.foxnews.com/2014/01/06/reports-police-know-who-kidnapped-madeleine-mccann-can%E2%80%99t-arrest-them">Here</a> is the Fox News page about it but there is no source.</p>

<p>No idea what the purchase of the house has to do with anything.  It&#39;s a house in Maryland not in Portugal so what is the connection?  Maybe that is where he was taking the trip to.  That would make a lot more sense.</p>

<p>3.)Spirit Cooking: To me it doesn&#39;t matter if they went or not.  This spirit cooking event was a live performance piece, a performance.  Was it weird? Very. Do I want to see a show like that? No way.  Do people who enjoy this kind of art deserve to be investigated? I don&#39;t think so, because I&#39;m pretty sure you&#39;d have a lot of people to investigate. Again <a href="http://townhall.com/tipsheet/katiepavlich/2016/11/04/no-john-podestas-spirit-cooking-wasnt-above-devil-worship-n2241548">here</a> is the article that explains the situation. Also, what is the deal with the obsession over devil worship?  How many satanic rituals do people think are going on out there? This is a continuance of a fear started in the 1980&#39;s. You can read about it <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satanic_ritual_abuse">here</a>.</p>

<p>4.) Epstein: Possible Bill was in on something. I&#39;m more doubtful of Hillary. At the same time there seems to be zero evidence so gotta let that one go.</p>

<p>5.)  Silsby: This woman was a person with good intentions but no sense to back it up.  It is not crazy to have someone doing something they believe is right for religious purposes that others would say is wrong.  I think she thought she was doing the right thing, probably had a bunch of wrong information, and then acted on her religious faith.  Also, if she wanted to smuggle children out to be sold into child sex rings, then why wouldn&#39;t she try to take orphans? Wouldn&#39;t people be less likely to come looking for them?  Or why wouldn&#39;t she be better prepared?  If shes part of this elite sex ring then shouldn&#39;t she be an expert on these kinds of things? Honestly, I think she was a sanctimonious missionary who believed fully what she was doing was right and went about it completely wrong.</p>

<p>6.) I understand the history and possibility for high level underground sex rings.  I definitely think it is something that should be handled very seriously and investigated fully.  I think that a lot of this is happening on the dark web and through secret channels which is where most law enforcement is focused.  It is possible for the elite to buy their way out of trouble, but at the same time if the evidence is strong enough and in the right hands, there isn&#39;t really a way out of it. I am also tired of typing @_@.</p>

<p>I appreciate you helping me see what people are looking at in this whole pizzagate thing.  My problem is that I don&#39;t really see anything that bad in the evidence so far presented to me.  The explanations I come to are much less of a stretch than the child sex ring theory. To me this is an occam&#39;s razor situation.  It would be much more interesting if pizzagate is true, but I really think people just want it to be true because they would feel better.  The idea of helping children is a noble effort but you can&#39;t go around hurting innocent people in the process.  Nobody should be called insane or crazy for wanting to look into these matters, but wanting to take extreme action(recent gunman, ignoring reasonable doubt) make the entire conspiracy look crazy.  I would love to see more information related to this whole thing.  I find it all very interesting even though I am not a believer. Thanks again for contributing.</p>

<p>Edit: Also related to the artwork: You(and a lot of others) have said that the article from the washington post about their personal art was removed.  That article wasn&#39;t removed. <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A43480-2004Sep22.html">Here</a> is a link to it(it has 3 pages, the 3rd page is the archived one you linked).  I don&#39;t know why people would say it was removed other than to try and make this all more believable.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>One other small note I forgot to add:</p>

<p>You stressed that the email was sent AFTER she was kidnapped.</p>

<p>If you leave for vacation on the 1st, and I email you on the 4th and say Have a safe trip, that doesn&#39;t mean you weren&#39;t already on vacation.  It only means that you&#39;re either still on vacation, or just going on vacation.</p>

<p>Also, 5-4 is the date of the first email in the account. It&#39;s possible anything prior to that was deleted or that it&#39;s a new account, but regardless, there&#39;s no data there to verify one way or the other.</p>

<p>There is an email that says they traveled there in July though, so we know it&#39;s at least on their radar of places they go to : <a href="https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/7941">https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/7941</a></p>

<p>So there&#39;s still nothing that dismisses it, just a lot of weirdness that makes it possible, and a bunch of &quot;possible&quot; mixed with nearly identically matching sketches, is enough for me to say it&#39;s at least worth considering and not dismissing.</p>

But also couldn&#39;t you then say he wasn&#39;t leaving until the 5th? or the 6th? If I spoke to a friend on a tuesday or a wednesday and they were leaving on a friday, if I wasn&#39;t going to see them again I would wish them a safe trip. There is a lot of leeway in both directions here, which I feel makes the whole idea pointless, especially when you don&#39;t know where he went.  </p>

<p>In this new post at least the connection of Portugal is present. The problem is <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/us-portugal-tourism-idUSKCN0VP1JE">Portugal</a> is an incredibly <a href="http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/ST.INT.ARVL?locations=PT">popular</a> tourist destination.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>1)The explanations for these comments really don&#39;t make much sense to me..  I mean I&#39;ve never heard anyone say &quot;yum.. baby.. &quot; on a public instagram account  in the context of an article that references another ping pong place with a whole bunch of weirdness surrounding it as well.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve showed that picture to about 7 different people and every single of one of them said &quot;What the fuck?&quot;.<br/>
Mayo is on urban dictionary as slang for semen.  Or, maybe they like &quot;double mayo&quot; on their pizza, or maybe it&#39;s an 
inside joke,or maybe it&#39;s something else altogether.  </p>

<p>2) I&#39;m only proposing a theory, as it&#39;s hard to argue that the two sketches look nearly identical to the podestas.  If one matched and the other didn&#39;t, I probably would have written it off, but that&#39;s not the case.  It was also just announced in the last few days that the police have a new lead in relation to this related to a &quot;child trafficking gang&quot;.  That seems incredibly odd that this case with all this strangeness around it, that has a sketch that matches both podestas, yet has been relatively stale for years and years, suddenly has a new lead on it 10 years after it happened , immediately after people draw attention to the similarities of the sketch.</p>

<p>Again, not evidence, not proof, merely yet another odd coincidence. </p>

<p>3) I&#39;m not sure what you&#39;re getting at. I&#39;m not obsessed with devil worshiping or occult stuff.  I had no idea spiritcooking even existed prior to this, I certainly didn&#39;t know it was considered &quot;art&quot; (even though she said herself when it&#39;s practiced in private it&#39;s a ritual and not art, but whatever).  I mean you linked me a video showing what it was, so there&#39;s not really any confusion here on what&#39;s going on. Dismissing it as &quot;just art&quot; is a bit dishonest/naive in my opinion.  When that&#39;s the kind of thing people are involved in, and the type of thing they organize, you can&#39;t honestly argue that it&#39;s a &quot;cooking event&quot;.</p>

<p>4) So they take 30 flights on the plane of a known, convicted pedophile, to his island, and your analysis of that is &quot;No proof&quot;, dismissed?</p>

<p>5) Again, very clear statements made by people that highlight very clear contradictions in her story, and you&#39;re bending over backwards to dismiss them outright.   </p>

<p>It would seem to me that at this point, you&#39;re consciously and ACTIVELY trying to explain away every possible point by dismissing things and giving every person the full benefit of the doubt in every situation.   It may be that the pictures are nothing, maybe spirit cooking is totally normal, maybe nothing foul goes on on the lolita express, maybe laura silsby just made a mistake, and maybe all the pedophiles just hang out on the dark web, and maybe a bunch of adoption agencies having symbols that match pedophile symbols is a coincidence, and maybe Clinton passing legislation that helped make adoption profitable is a coincidence, and I could go on and on and on and on and on. </p>

<p>Maybe they are all coincidences, but I have to say, as a pretty level headed person, for me to look at all these &quot;misunderstandings&quot; and &quot;coincidences&quot;, and write them off, while we KNOW that human trafficking/child pornography goes on in a massive way, and we KNOW it gets covered up, and we KNOW the government has immunity in regards to it..  well, I just can&#39;t look at all that and dismiss it because I don&#39;t have an email that says &quot;IM TRAFFICKING CHILDREN AND I HOPE NO ONE READS THIS EMAIL&quot;.</p>

<p>Again, I&#39;m not messaging these people, I&#39;m not protesting them, I&#39;m not slandering them, and I believe they are innocent until proven guilty, but i refuse to treat anyone as crazy who thinks these are enough coincidences and weirdness to want to further investigate.</p>

<p>I hope I turn out to be wrong and none of this is going on.  There&#39;s simply too much prior proof of this type of thing happening in plain sight with people in power for me to dismiss it though. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>1.)  People make stupid jokes all the time.  Magazine called edible. Baby is in this magazine. Is baby edible? That&#39;s all there is to it.  People make dead baby jokes, does that mean they killed a baby? Also here&#39;s a <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23doublemayo">twitter</a> search for #doublemayo, and here&#39;s an <a href="https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/doublemayo/">instagram</a> search.  I don&#39;t understand half the hashtags out there.  There is no suggestion of wrong doing here, only weird shitty jokes and references to things we don&#39;t get.</p>

<p>2.)  I really cannot get on board with this one. At least with the other stuff I can agree on the weirdness of it.  The two sketches were of the same man as described by two different witnesses.  This happened on the night she disappeared.  You said yourself that the email wishing him a good trip was from the 4th even though the witness saw the man on the 3rd. <a href="https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/9364">Here</a> is that email.  It doesn&#39;t even seem to be wishing podesta a safe trip. It is addressed to Mr. Sandler. I am very confused as to the logic/meaning behind this one.</p>

<p>Also <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/2323187/cops-given-cash-to-probe-important-new-lead-that-maddie-was-snatched-by-people-trafficking-gang/">here</a> is a link to a story(the source that foxnews used) about the new developments.  Again saying that this is a european child abducting gang.  Also the investigation hasn&#39;t been stale for years, it has been active the whole time. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Operation Grange:At the request of the British Home Secretary Alan Johnson, the Home Office began discussions in 2010 with the Association of Chief Police Officers about setting up a new investigation.[175] In May 2011, under Home Secretary Theresa May, Scotland Yard launched an investigative review, Operation Grange, with a team of 29 detectives and eight civilians.[176] The inquiry, which by June 2015 had cost £10.1m, was financed by a government contingency fund at the request of Prime Minister David Cameron, reportedly after News International persuaded the government to involve the British police.[177]The team was led by Commander Simon Foy.[176] Detective Chief Inspector (DCI) Andy Redwood of Scotland Yard&#39;s Homicide and Serious Crime Command was the first senior investigating officer, reporting to Detective Chief Superintendent Hamish Campbell.[176] Redwood retired in December 2014 and was replaced by DCI Nicola Wall.[178] The investigation was scaled back in October 2015 and the number of officers reduced to four.[10] The Home Office funded the final months of the investigation in 2016 to the tune of £95,000.[179]The Operation Grange team had tens of thousands of documents translated, released an updated age-progressed image of Madeleine,[180] and investigated 560 lines in inquiry and 8,685 potential sightings of Madeleine. By 2015 they had taken 1,338 statements, collected 1,027 exhibits, and investigated 60 persons of interest, as well as 650 sex offenders.[10] </p>

<p>To me there is no coincidence. There is nothing here other than the fact that some digital police images based off of descriptions of a man in portugal happens to look like two different people from across the world who are completely unrelated.  Also, I am sure you could find millions of older men who would look similar enough to those photos. In fact, <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=madeleine+mccann+efit&amp;amp;tbm=isch&amp;amp;imgil=x5cd8MpTiySaEM%253A%253BT0vQ9vdXA5BqeM%253Bhttp%25253A%25252F%25252Fjillhavern.forumotion.net%25252Ft8018p110-new-e-fits-express-maddy-pictures-of-new-suspect&amp;amp;source=iu&amp;amp;pf=m&amp;amp;tbs=simg:CAESnQIJkNQsDUVsY0cakQILEKjU2AQaBggXCD4IQgwLELCMpwgaYgpgCAMSKPEF8gWtH4QIkweuH8ca1Aa1GssPkDqaOvoksS6CLZE67yTvMfgkmToaMKCG9hRknnJ0h3C9vMM04n-bJfNjnl5uT32jHXi0dlDY1LGklU2O9GCP3gwnkgAgKyAEDAsQjq7-CBoKCggIARIEGMzdlgwLEJ3twQkaewoXCgRoZWFk2qWI9gMLCgkvbS8wNGhndGsKFgoDamF32qWI9gMLCgkvbS8wMWs5bGoKFgoDbGlw2qWI9gMLCgkvbS8wNnBqMmsKFgoDZWFy2qWI9gMLCgkvbS8wMzl4al8KGAoFYmVhcmTapYj2AwsKCS9tLzAxNWhfdAw&amp;amp;fir=x5cd8MpTiySaEM%253A%252CT0vQ9vdXA5BqeM%252C_&amp;amp;usg=__wJNgVZkWOvfdX62xje8E6izrkb8%3D&amp;amp;biw=1745&amp;amp;bih=920&amp;amp;ved=0ahUKEwihhLvM_ufQAhVO6GMKHc5gAgAQyjcIRA&amp;amp;ei=OBlLWKEIztCPA87BCQ#imgrc=x5cd8MpTiySaEM%3A">here</a> is a google search of the image in which you can see people trying to fit the face to other people(like one of the people on the trip, which would make much more sense)</p>

<p>3.) I didn&#39;t mean to accuse you of believing this but I have seen a lot of references to it in relation to pizzagate. It is something that is often referenced in conspiracy theories based around the elite.  I agree that the performance was weird and disturbing, but there are many performance art pieces that are strange. I don&#39;t understand modern art at all, but I accept that some people enjoy it. <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=weird+performance+art&amp;amp;oq=weird+performance+art&amp;amp;aqs=chrome..69i57j0l5.2208j0j7&amp;amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;amp;ie=UTF-8#q=disturbing+performance+art&amp;amp;tbm=vid">Here</a> is a link to more strange performances. I don&#39;t think someone&#39;s taste in art should be used as evidence that they are committing crimes.  If there was other evidence maybe? But even so it would not be worth using if there was real evidence. Art is not illegal to look at and enjoy, regardless of what it is(assuming it was legally done).</p>

<p>4.)I am fine with looking into the whole Epstein thing. I feel like that is not really connected to the meat of this whole pizzagate thing.  I would work on getting something done in that area rather than pizza. At least there you have a pedophile and people interacting strangely with him.</p>

<p>5.) I am not saying that Silsby is innocent, or didn&#39;t know what she was doing was illegal.  I just think that she thought she was doing a good thing.  She was caught, the children were returned, and she did spend time in jail.  Yes she was set free but I don&#39;t see any reason to believe Clinton got her out of jail.  If you want to look into Silsby and her organization and their behavior that&#39;s fine with me, though I&#39;m not confident there is anything there besides some zealot missionaries trying too hard.</p>

<p>I am sorry that I can&#39;t really agree with these points. I promise that if you presented concrete evidence that I would admit to it. I do admit to the weirdness of some of the presented material but I just don&#39;t think it is damning evidence or even evidence at all.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>What? Should we not give everyone the benefit of the doubt? Especially those who have not even been committed of a crime? I am carefully considering the evidence presented to me and rationally coming to a conclusion about their meaning.  I will agree on the Epstein and Silsby cases as at least something actually happened there.  I don&#39;t think it goes as deep as others might but there might be something there, I don&#39;t know all the details.  However, all of the &quot;evidence&quot; related to secret codes and pizza and these essentially innocent photos, is pretty nuts to me.  I am pretty sure most rational people would not come to the conclusion of child sex rings and secret code unless someone planted that idea in their mind. And even then it takes a lot of creative thinking to make it work.  You mentioned adoption agencies with pedophile symbols and Clinton passing legislation but we haven&#39;t discussed that yet so I don&#39;t really know what you&#39;re referencing.  The whole reason I made this post was because I have no idea how this whole thing will end. I suppose(assuming none of it is true/no evidence is found) that it will fade away until there are only a few die hard believers still thinking about it. I was curious about what would end it in the minds of those who are suspicious.  It is scary to think that people would be so sure of such a harsh accusation based on such weak evidence.</p>

<p>But if the FBI does the investigation, but is also in on it, then does that investigation really mean anything?</p>

<p>After the way they let clinton off, even after finding her guilty, I would assume they would be complicit. I bet they use the ring as blackmail over politicians, and they wouldn&#39;t disrupt their own power by doing a legit investigation</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s really hard to answer that, because there&#39;s so much evidence of shady behavior in general (unrelated to trafficking/etc).</p>

<p>Our government is constantly lying to us, circumstances around events are constantly in question or contradicted or proven false.  Evidence is hidden, access restricted, investigations thwarted, investigators mysteriously dying, narratives woven, etc etc etc.  People have no idea what the NSA/CIA are actually up to, because whenever they want us to not know that, it&#39;s perfectly fine to make sure we don&#39;t and nothing ever happens.  </p>

<p>So when we have reason to believe that our intelligence agencies have known about a trafficking ring and have protected those involved from being exposed, for decades, it&#39;s pretty tough for any civilian to believe when they say &quot;We investigated, there&#39;s nothing going on&quot;.</p>

<p>If your wife cheats on you 5 times, and everytime you suspect her of it you question her and she vehemently lies about it for a week straight before admitting it, is it fair to say that the 6th time it happens you are justified in not believing her when she says &quot;but I swear i didn&#39;t!&quot;  ?</p>

<p>We have proof this occurs.  We have actual evidence from real investigations that the white house and politicians are involved in pedophilia rings and trafficking, and we have actual evidence that they thwarted investigations.  So, who&#39;s really at fault here? The &quot;conspiracy theorists&quot;?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>To better understand the situation. My discussions with others helped me to better understand people&#39;s beliefs on the matter as well as what&#39;s driving them. I started the thread because I understood that if investigations happened and people were convicted, people who are looking into pizza gate would be satisfied; I wanted to know how could this come to a close if there really wasn&#39;t anything going on.  My fear is that if nothing is found people will never be satisfied based on how sure they seem to be. Most people didn&#39;t really discuss that but it ended up being a good conversation anyway.  Many thought if a proper investigation took place and found nothing they would accept that. Clearly I&#39;m not a believer but I enjoyed learning about the other side. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The <a href="https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/30613">email</a> in question references the box that the food comes in specifically the shape.  Is it not possible that they traditionally have played dominoes on this box?  I know it doesn&#39;t make the most sense but at the same time when people are talking to friends they will often reference inside jokes or events only their friend is aware of.  They never expected to have to explain every word in every email, so not all of them will make sense to people outside of the loop.  Instead of coded language I think it is more reasonable to explain it as personal references.</p>

<p>Kid taped to the table? She is smiling in the photo and I&#39;m sure could easily wiggle free based on the small amount of masking tape. This is an innocent photo, and the only reason you would think it was sexual is because it was suggested to you or you wanted it to be.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The picture is a bit strange, but in no way proof of what people are saying it is.  If the children looked distressed or there was some kind of sexual suggestion in the object that they were given that&#39;s one thing.  Looks like the person was traveling in europe and had currency for the trip.  They let the baby chew on the money because it was cute and harmless.</p>

<p>As for the instagram pic, that is not in the actual restaurant.  It is from a personal instagram account where people are allowed to post whatever they want.  There are no children in the painting.  It is just a weird sexual pizza painting.  At worst this might be a poor decision in terms of p.r. but I&#39;m not even sure who&#39;s account it is.  I don&#39;t know how he is affiliated with the restaurant.</p>

Why aren&#39;t people up in arms to find and prosecute the people involved in that message?  If a message like that had been found in the emails it definitely would have sparked an investigation.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It is from a prosecuted case that how it&#39;s known. Obviously pizza can be just pizza most of the time but when you use pizza as a coded word, and offer to cut up ways that make no sense it becomes suspicious. Add in the sexualized artwork and photos and the dots start to connect.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think the problem is that people want the dots to connect.  Some of these dots are spaced pretty far apart to be connected.  Even now you&#39;re referencing two different leaks, right?  I thought we were focusing on the recent pizzagate related emails.  In regards to that email(which I said in the other response) it seems to be a joke.  If I was having a pizza party and told everyone that there would only be one slice that we would have to cut up for everyone,  people would think I was joking, not that I was trying to distribute child porn.  Now you have to realize that that is what is going on in these emails.  We are reading personal messages sent between co-workers who have their own relationships and senses of humor.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Do you really think that is a solid piece of evidence? It is not a clear picture at all. An incredibly blurry pixelated zoom in of a low res pic that doesn&#39;t clearly show anything. I can barely tell that the zoomed in part is an eye at all. That is something out of a CSI enhance photo scene.  If people really believe that is evidence then I am losing hope here.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I understand where you are coming from, and I wish that were the case.  There definitely could be or could have been an investigation into the claims pizzagate is making.  I do not think that the internet is really helping with this if it is an investigation.  All pizzagate is doing is drawing attention to all of these things, where if they were really being investigated by a professional and skilled group, things would be done more carefully. I see a lot of pizzagate claims of things being changed after they discovered them and so that is proof of wrong doing.  If it really is, then wouldn&#39;t it have been better not to give it away that you were on to them? If you really believe what you said then can you accept the possibility that the internet&#39;s involvement is only interfering with the proper investigation?</p>

<p>You also have a lot of faith in Trump to handle this situation.  Isn&#39;t Trump part of this elite class? Did he not have a relationship with Epstein?  Was there not a woman who claimed he raped her as a child?  If you  look at the situation from a neutral perspective, what is it about Trump that makes him different? You don&#39;t think Trump has anything to hide?</p>

<p>People wish things were more interesting than they are.  Someone suggests a secret sex code based around pizza and things fly off the handle.  All based on the fact that the emails talked about pizza related to events in which they served pizza?  Pizzagate believers want to tear the lives of the people they suspect apart.  A lot of them seem to want them locked up right now without any real evidence.  People want so badly for this to be true and for them to be able to help that they will spin things whatever way they have to to make this work.</p>
