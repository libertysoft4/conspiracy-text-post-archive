    <div class="md"><p>The thing is the internet doesn&#39;t forget. Someone pulling up a tweet by the Twitter CEO from a decade ago when there was absolutely no social network on it, mostly just a bunch of Silicon Valley programmers sharing code snippets and chatting. It&#39;s not convincing, it&#39;s just sigh worthy.</p>

<p>I say really weird shit all the time. Someone being able to take a 10 year log of what I say, yeah you could jump to outrageous conclusions by me quoting movies alone.</p>

<p>My thing has been guilt by association. How come the rich seem perfectly fine hanging out with convicted pedos, but the people I&#39;ve known who are in gangs, criminals, served jail terms, etc. would beat the shit out of a suspected one in their neighborhood (it happens to sex offenders all the time) not go and hang out on vacation with one, or have a dinner party at their house. This was my kinda red pill for &quot;something&#39;s wrong at the top&quot;. Don&#39;t get me wrong, I knew there&#39;d be some, but this sounds like more than one rotten apple in the buschel.</p>

<p>The NYT basically having the first article out over local papers and television, etc. The police and FBI seemingly being on top of it immediately, and then major social media corporations involved. They just hoisted a massive red flag.</p>

<p>People get accused of shit all the time, and it blows over. Why did it take less than 2 weeks for a massive scale response to help some little pizza chain. Even if nothing was up and he just had some politician friends. They&#39;re human rats, they&#39;d flee not pull strings to help. So what the fuck is this.</p>

<p>My boss wouldn&#39;t get a NYT article espousing his innocence, why is this guy. Who the fuck managed to get the cops to actually move for at best a &quot;cyber crime&quot; of slander.</p>

<p>Say you&#39;ll kill the Prez and you might get a Secret Service member stop by to politely explain why you shouldn&#39;t be saying stuff like that. It happens, and they&#39;re surprisingly nice about it when it gets reported. But for at best slander, this pizza guy gets the whole fucking US upper echelons moving in days? They normally wouldn&#39;t have even got a memo between departments.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So if literally anyone/anything is accused of doing something shady, regardless of any evidence or lack of evidence, it&#39;s proof of a coverup if people speak out against it?

    <div class="md"><p>I agree with you. Just why is it the NYT first, not the usual months/years long endeavor it takes for any normal or famous person. Why does some little pizza joint get the NYT defending him, but Michael Jackson didn&#39;t get any defense, but a witch hunt. On really shady heresay evidence too. This is no difference, but the King of Pop can&#39;t get what this nobody got.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well part of Michael Jackson&#39;s was that he had actual (supposed) victims. Pizzagate is just &quot;they must be doing this&quot; even though there isn&#39;t anyone who claimed/heard/saw any victimization. </p>

<p>Now that the internet and social media are bigger, these things can enter into mainstream conversations more quickly and easily. So why not tell people that something probably untrue is probably untrue. I personally see no issue with the media having a small rally against fake &amp; false news. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This. In the videos where the comet pizza owner is interviewed and giving a tour, he&#39;s asked why he started a pizza joint. He said that&#39;s all he was good at. So he emphasized his apparent smallness. He&#39;s just a regular dude that opened a pizza joint... that gets defended by the NYT and Washington Post and Snopes and has Twitter, FB, YouTube, and Reddit all pulling content that makes this poor guy look bad. He&#39;s just a poor pizza shop owner trying to serve his customers god food and make it fun for the family. Awe shucks. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yup. And the way to have all bases covered is to hide the real conspiracy within a fake conspiracy and then cover that fake conspiracy up. Then we also fool the critical thinkers. Not saying I suspect that to be the case with Pizzagate but these two are events that may be examples of that:<br/>

    <div class="md"><p>im not even a big conspiracy dude, and I started following on day 2 just after the election.. I honestly feel super confident that some degree of shadyness is ongoing, and the reaction we have seen in the last week only confirms that we&#39;ve hit a nerve... then once you start looking more into similar cases reported in the last 20 years the correlations, the people, the way its been suppressed is all almost identical.. as far as Im concerned the only reason it hasnt been fully suppressed at this point, or has managed to gain so much traction is compared to previous reveals is due to the emergence of the internet as we know it, and its gone viral.</p>

Circumstantial evidence is really strong to get the ball rolling if there&#39;s a crime committed, but until then the majority of brainwashed masses accuse everyone of tinfoiling. </p>

<p>It&#39;s basically impossible to prove a negative, we&#39;re the ones making a claim and it is our job to put forward evidence supporting that claim. They could try to shut down our evidence to make our arguments fall apart, but they won&#39;t bring up actual evidence involved in order to explain it away because that would just give a bigger spotlight to the suspicious connections we&#39;ve all seen. And there&#39;s no way they could explain it all away without saying &quot;Well, it&#39;s clearly a code, but we just don&#39;t know what it&#39;s a code for,&quot; and they wouldn&#39;t want to admit wrongdoing of any kind. </p>

<p>I agree with your your statement that a theory needs to be proven before it should be believed and that it is on the supporters of the theory to provide credible proof.</p>

<p>But with the title of the article they are claiming that all of pizzagate is fake, but the majority of the story is about how it affects his business and employees. At no point do they write what part they know is fake, or disproven.</p>

<p>So you can say that a theory is not backed by (police) evidence for example, but you can&#39;t dismiss a theory as being fake unless you have proof that it is fake. That&#39;s the distinction I was trying to point out.</p>

<p>But by using the word &#39;FAKE&#39;, they are making a statement of fact. It is not an ambiguous word. Can they prove that fact?</p>

<p>They have made an accusation that something is fake, and in doing so they have now become an accuser. They should have evidence to back up the claim they have made.</p>

<p>The term fake news has a specific meaning lately because people have created lots of it with zero evidence to drive ad traffic.

<p>I agree with you, not all stories deserve the same treatment, and yes, a lot of stuff on the internet is exaggerated or made up to garner views. But if a large outlet like the NYT is to take on a story then it should treat it properly.</p>

<p>Some people will believe pizzagate allegations no matter what, some people won&#39;t ever believe. Dismissing the claims off hand by calling pizzagate fake does not help get anyone to the truth however.</p>

<p>And no, it&#39;s not up to the newspaper to provide proof. We will have to wait for proper police investigations on the matter. But don&#39;t go calling something fake unless you know its fake.</p>

<p>Think about it this way, if you were charged with protecting a real pedophile wing, what better way to do so than by propping up and feeding a story about a fake one. You get a whole bunch of people emotionally invested in the fake story, and spreading the information about it far and wide. Then you &quot;disprove&quot; it, or merely disprove certain aspects of it. Then next time, when people discover an actual pedophile ring, others are much less apt to believe it. &quot;Oh yeah, just like pizzagate, right?&quot;</p>

<p>It&#39;s hard to say, but there are a number of theories, ranging from them actually believing that doing so grants some power in a magickal sense, to children&#39;s blood having rejuvenating potential in a scientific sense, to it simply being a natural predilection they have, to power over children being concomitant with desiring power in a political sense, to it being used as a blackmail token in order to induct these people into higher positions of power. I think it&#39;s likely a combination of these things, though the last one seems fairly compelling to me. </p>

Yet when something strikes most people around the world as seriously dodgy, when jokes are made about selling children, by people with sexually orientated names we are supposed to shrug our shoulders and say &#39;meh&#39;?
All we want is someone to investigate and let us know that nothing bad is happening, but nobody is actually even looking into it. It&#39;s akin to tell a mother to eff off and not to worry, even if she has a strong suspicion.
We don&#39;t want anything more than someone to take a good, hard LOOK, so we can all sleep easier. Why is that not granted after everything out there that is at best done by really tasteless people, that should be exposed for what they are and at worst by paedos?</p>

<p>Well yeah.  Of course.  It’s certainly a hell of a long shot that these pedos will get brought to justice (on this plane of existence anyway), but it’s NOT out of any stretch of the imagination whatsoever to logically assess THAT THEY’RE FUCKING PEDOS in the first place.</p>

<p>And <em>that</em> is the big contention here and immediate criticism with your previous response.  You called the substantial mountain of circumstantial evidence continuing to build up “flimsy” when the fact is that it’s anything but.</p>

<p>It’s disturbingly strong, actually.  And it’s continuing to mount.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Within the context of this pizzagate controversy, however, we’re not really dealing with or talking about <em>your</em> pubes, but those of underage children.  Your user name just seemed rather to stand out in the context of the topic.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, but one level deeper, all speculation here, but lets say there is a mountain of evidence for organized pedocracy (and there is) wouldn&#39;t it be easy to send out an easily disprovable fake allegation, get truth seeking folks all flamed up about it, then easily disprove the fake allegations in public in the mainstream and then whenever future evidence leaks that actually is provable the mainstream regular Joes will write it off because that one time there was a crazy witch hunt about these things. The whole thing stemmed from one 8chan post about pizza code words and is all built on circumstance and jumping to conclusions. It really reeks of disinfo and was probably spooled up by internet agent provocateurs.  I think the whole pizzagate thing is a red herring to discredit any future leaks when there is actual smoking gun evidence.

    <div class="md"><p>I think you are right. The elite have been afraid of the internet because it has the power to unite ppl. I think they ran some think tanks and found how to use the power of the internet to their advantage. Just as in the old days the Romans would cause fires and destruction then theyd say it was the enemy and offer solutions. Now they are just starting fires online and pronounce bs to throw everyone off.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>One easy thing to investigate are the victims. As you saw from the Houston, the Franklin, the Dutroux and Casa Pia scandals, the victims do either talk or are murdered. 
E.g. in Houston the number was 500 dead boys per year. Lots of boys started talking in secret - not to the press of course. These numbers cannot be covered up.</p>

These people are nerds who travel the world talking to non-native English-speakers every day. It isn&#39;t surprising that they might pick up some idiosyncratic speech patterns. That doesn&#39;t begin to justify a witch hunt. As a person who himself uses weird phrases when talking to friends, I find the whole idea frightening and disgusting.</p>

<p>You&#39;re talking about people&#39;s personal emails about their personal lives. These aren&#39;t business settings. There&#39;s no expectation or need for uniformity or formality.

<p>Also, did you not see how much Subway Jared paid to fuck children? Like $100. And he&#39;s a celebrity. Rich people don&#39;t need global charities and private jets to fuck kids. Go to vice.com, there are kids all over America just waiting to be fucked at affordable prices. </p>

<p>Actually, I found seven comments in the first three pages of your reddit comment history strongly suggesting that you are a wight, an undead creature very similar to a vampire.</p>

<p>How else do you explain comments like this?:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>DIE there are to many humans and that is why there getting displaced</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Once you understand that wights are not native English speakers and make frequent spelling errors, the rest follows quite reasonably. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>ill eat one whit u but mine,s made out of chocolate</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This sentence doesn&#39;t make sense in any context. However, a search of 4chan shows that &quot;chocolate&quot; is another word for black person. It becomes clear that you and another &quot;whit&quot; are planning to devour your victims, but yours is a black person. </p>

<blockquote>

<p>This one doesn&#39;t make sense in any context. It must be code.</p>

<blockquote>

But its not all lie,s.

<p>This one makes reference again to how wights are not native to America and are not English speakers.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>This one as well.</p>

<p>You also make several references to witches.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>This next one doesn&#39;t make sense at all. It has to be code for the undead and undead activities.</p>

<p>If these emails are fabricated to cover up the code, can you poke holes in it? If you went to a site like Trulia, would you find every house they described on the market? And would those houses have every feature they described?

<p>That is besides the point. My response was to your statement that there was no context in the Podesta emails and that is provably false. </p>

<p>You are free to interpret the context however you like. While I have Pizzagate sympathies, I&#39;m not convinced enough to argue one way or the other. </p>

<p>In my honest opinion, people trying to rationalize all the emails are trying to see something/pigeonhole a narrative just as much as those who see a pedophile child sex ring. </p>

<p>The only thing I am 90% convinced of is that Podesta is talking in code and I am 66% convinced that it is probably something illegal.  </p>

<p>So, do you believe anything should be done at this point? Because any kind of investigation would be hugely antithetical to the Bill of Rights at this point. I can understand why Constitutional concerns might not stop someone who genuinely thinks children are being harmed, but if all that you know is that someone is speaking in code on their private emails, don&#39;t you think they should be left alone?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Everything I have seen about this is grossly out of the ordinary. I don&#39;t care if people are satanists, eat cake shaped like a person, have pictures of bound children on their wall, use known paedo pictures in their logos or make jokes about babies that are a little under the beltline, with sexual screen names. I don&#39;t even care if they have &#39;art&#39; on the wall of their establishment that shows clear interest in the occult, I really couldn&#39;t care less. However if I was a parent there is no way I&#39;d take my kid to their place, find it OK to joke about &#39;preferences&#39; [after someone shouting &#39;boys&#39;] during a [funny] speech. It is all fine and dandy as long as adults doing it in an adult environment. 
The kicker and the worry stems from this being marketed as a FAMILY restaurant, that there are performances by bands whose videos have paedo signs in them and a grown woman, dressed as a child is singing, the band&#39;s name is Sex Stains [Planet Pizza&#39;s own home band] and who are performing for the whole family after 23:00h. 
You see where I am getting at here? Nobody cares what adults are doing but when they are doing dodgy stuff, I hope nobody expects this to be from a Family orientated place. Which it is. Therefore it&#39;s NOT ok. Need investigating as clearly these people are not quite Mary frigging Poppins!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Here is my question. So far on the &quot;official news stories&quot; I see online, they claim that pizza gate has officially been debunked. On what basis are there claims for it being false? Simply that the people involved were asked and they said &quot;no that&#39;s not true&quot; and nothing more? I i&#39;m not saying that I 100% believe absolutely everything uncovered but after the Franklin cover-up I have been more than open-minded when it comes to these sorts of things being true. So far I just see this being dismissed as just a case of conservatives trying to sabotage Hillary Clinton. That&#39;s way too easy for me to believe that pizzagate is completely false. So again am I missing something on official sources for this being factually debunked?</p>

I think a large part of it is legitimate though and you can&#39;t get bogged down by people who are taking it to the extremes.

The fact that some of the simplest things like the question I asked you is a huge problem for me, there&#39;s no excuse not to know the basics at least at this point and the officials involved aren&#39;t addressing it and the implications of this being true are inconceivable. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The point of what the person is trying to ask you, about the handkerchief, is to carefully read the email from bottom to top and to pay attention.</p>

<p>I actually brought this point up before, and this specific exchange is what confused me and made me actually think that there might be something to it all.</p>

<p>Like you, I originally assumed it was a gift perhaps, of maybe a treasure map with pizza on it. But seriously, and I promise you that I&#39;m not trying to be condescending at all because I was thinking the same exact things about it as you, just think about it.</p>

<p>The realtor emails the woman about finding a handkerchief. The only defining details that she gives, at all, is that it&#39;s square and black and white. That&#39;s it. She doesn&#39;t mention pizza, nor does she mention a map. Just the color and shape.</p>

<p>Then, the woman who received that email, forwards it to Podesta, and says that the realtor found a handkerchief that she &quot;thinks&quot; has a &quot;map&quot; on it that could be &quot;pizza-related&quot;.</p>

<p>So, when I realized that the woman who emailed Podesta described the handkerchief in a totally different way than the realtor, I thought that <em>maybe</em> the realtor had given her a phone call perhaps to describe it more. Although to be honest, if the handkerchief had an actual map or pizza on it, she would have described those details rather than saying it&#39;s just black and white and square. </p>

<p>But even if they had spoken, and she was given more details, why would she use words that suggest she isn&#39;t sure? Why would she say she &quot;thinks&quot; it has a map and that it could be pizza &quot;related&quot; if she was <em>told</em> it had an actual map and/or pizza on it?</p>

<p>After seeing artwork of a child being raped on a small piece of cloth, and seeing that DNA from semen or blood left on fabric/scene of the crime has been referred to as a map, <em>and</em> that, in this case, pizza could absolutely be a code word, it..just made sense that it could be a possibility. And that combined with everything else, it starts to paint a clear picture. </p>

<p>I just wanted to explain what they were getting at when they were asking you about that email. Hopefully I explained properly and coherently why it absolutely (in my opinion, and many others) seems off.</p>

<p>I just wanted to explain it to you myself because I also had originally asked the same questions you did before I decided to pay attention to the exact wording used and to what each person in the email actually said.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No problem. I realized the same odd stuff about that email myself maybe a week or two ago, and it&#39;s honestly the thing that convinced me I needed to look deeper and not just assume it&#39;s some form of &quot;satanic panic.&quot;</p>

<p>Unfortunately though, there are a lot of people who will just assume it means nothing, without investigating all of the other stuff that makes all of this suspicious. </p>

<p>It can be really frustrating knowing there is something off and having people call you crazy for seeing the lines connecting the dots. All we can do is try to explain and get people to open their eyes so they can look at all of this information honestly and without bias.</p>

<p>Hopefully, the right person will realize there&#39;s possibly something very wrong, kids could be in danger and not care that people will call them a looney for making sure all of this suspicious stuff is or isn&#39;t true.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>How do you know the woman didn&#39;t read that initial email, then speak to the realtor on the phone at a later time where they got more details about the handkerchief?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I actually mentioned this in my post specifically <em>because</em> I asked the same question. I already answered that question. Did you read my entire post or just skim it?</p>

<p>To reiterate - (Aside from the fact that we see the email in which this handkerchief was first brought up, which shows us that they hadn&#39;t had a conversation about this handkerchief <em>before</em> the realtor sent her this email and thus realistically <em>would have</em> given a proper description with the actual defining details, such as pizza and a map, rather than simply shape and color, in the first email it was brought up.)</p>

<p><em>IF</em> the realtor had called this lady after sending her the email describing the handkerchief, with some extra detail (instead of doing that in the first place, as any normal person would have done), the specific words used to describe it to Podesta is the actual <em>strange</em> parts.</p>

<p>If the realtor told her it specifically had a map and pizza on it - it seems strange that she would say she THINKS it has a map that is pizza RELATED. If she was told specifically, again, most rational people would instead say something like &quot;the realtor said it had a map and pizza on it.&quot; Instead, her language implies she isn&#39;t sure. Which wouldn&#39;t make a hell of a lot of sense if she had received a call with the specific details.</p>

<p>Even if there was an email that happened outside of this email chain (and these emails themselves <em>are not edited and verified by Google themselves</em>) then the same logic would still apply. The point being that the realtor gave a description that never mentioned pizza or map, and even if she had somewhere else before the lady emailed Podesta, the second description uses language that implies doubt or being unsure.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Btw, &quot;map&quot; is NOT actually an official &quot;code word&quot; meaning semen. That has already been debunked as originating from 4chan itself...so we know that whoever created that original image where it brokedown &quot;commonly used code words&quot; was being deceptive</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;m not talking about any kind of official code words in regards to the term &quot;map&quot;, and I&#39;m not going by anything posted on 4chan because I haven&#39;t even <em>seen</em> whatever image it is that you&#39;re talking about.</p>

<p>Using the term map in this instance makes <em>sense</em> because any kind of bodily fluids containing DNA, left somewhere where a crime occurred, could be used as a sort of map leading to the perpetrator. </p>

<p>Not only am I positive that I&#39;ve heard it used that way at least once on one of those crime shows, but it isn&#39;t as if the word map never shows up around DNA, such as genetic mapping.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not sitting here saying that <em>this</em> email is some kind of smoking gun, nor is it even close to being the only &quot;evidence&quot; that there might be something going on here. All I&#39;m saying is that this is why a lot of people found that specific email suspicious and that combined with the multitude of other emails, connections and pictures, it seems even <em>more</em> suspicious. </p>

<p>I&#39;m also not saying that these people are definitely guilty. It could be nothing. However, to me, and a lot of other folks, everything combined is enough to at the very least, investigate.</p>

<p>People are investigated based on suspicion alone all the time. Unless you&#39;re caught red handed, investigators have to dig, make connections and find evidence.</p>

<p>In my mind, all of these people are innocent until proven guilty, and they all deserve a fair trial. I don&#39;t know they are guilty or innocent. All I believe, and plenty of others believe, is that there is absolutely enough here (not JUST this email) to investigate and look, to make sure.</p>

<p>There absolutely seems to be something wrong, and I sincerely hope that sooner rather than later, someone with authority will be allowed to investigate this. I don&#39;t see how anyone who <em>honestly</em> and without bias, can sit down, look at <strong>all</strong> of the  available information, and not seriously think that it&#39;s very possible a lot of children could be in danger.</p>

<p>I really do think that a lot of people who are rolling their eyes at this, and hand waving it away, are either automatically assuming that it&#39;s all bullshit because the people looking into it are nothing but nutjob conspiracy theorists, or they&#39;re not honest to God looking at <em>all</em> the information available. I&#39;m sure there&#39;s a few people who just don&#39;t want to believe it, as well as people who never will until an actual authority figure tells them so.</p>

<p>Regardless, there&#39;s nothing I can do about any of those people except try to explain why people find some of this stuff very suspicious, and combined with everything else, downright scary.</p>

<p>In my opinion, if I can get even one more person to take an honest look into everything, then hopefully it&#39;s worth tons of people calling me crazy.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So you read the emails from top to bottom correct? I got the first three emails, but what did the ones after those mean? Who were they and why we&#39;re they apart of the chain?</p>

<p>I&#39;m so confused why is the real estate agent messaging him about a handkerchief? Was she like having a open house and he had left it there, like it&#39;s his fav one, and if she is just a real estate agent how would she know who it belonged too?</p>

<p>But if it was a pedo thing. Why would again the real estate agent have the hanky and why would a real estate throw a pedo party or whatever (what do you think happened, sex party?) or is it just a guise and she&#39;s not a real estate agent. </p>

<p>Just context pls for the love of God</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The emails are read from bottom to top friend. It looks like they may have had a get together at a rental property perhaps? It is only the last two messages (the top two) that interest me, other people have theories about the whole thread I believe. </p>

<p>So in the last two messages you can see the realtor emails Susan Sandler about a handkerchief she found, she describes it as a black and white handkerchief, Susan emails JP and describes it as a handkerchief that seems to have a map that might be pizza related. My question is why did the description change so drastically and if it is one of those novelty towels with a map of it all on it or anywhere, why did the real estate agent not use that in her description? </p>

<p>I&#39;m simply not certain that online conspiracy theorists are worth the time reporting about or articles (even anti-pizzagate ones) would be endorsed by the &quot;victims&quot; if everything is as it appears on the surface.</p>

<p>The saddest part of it is that there is enough real stuff in the Clinton emails to actually get upset about. It would be more productive and useful to look at that stuff than to create some kind of dangerous conspiracy theory about what it doesn&#39;t actually contain.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I read spin talk as much as name calling of accusers even though case is sketchy at best.</p>

<p>What&#39;s more worrying to me is the way the press is speaking about those who could be accused. Like how ridiculous it is for such people are to well known, famous, rich, powerful to be involved in such crimes and if they did such things it would have come out years ago. </p>

<p>Crap.. Like schizoids and other mental issues, paedophiles aren&#39;t defined by nationality, ethnicity, class, social standing, ability, intelligence, etc ..</p>

<p>As for a powerful person hiding this sickness; well as they say with the more power and influence the easier it is to hide your sins.</p>

<p>Allegations of paedophilia in high places has been around since dot. The Cleveland Street scandal and Prince Albert Victor, Duke of Clarence and heir to the British throne (as well as Jack the Ripper suspect) is one from last century.</p>

<p>The actual allegation of J.Edgar Hoover being a homosexual is that he was having sex with boys. What I have read (in my opinion), this account is rejected by msm, not because of the woman who made the allegation was done for perjury in another matter, but because he was Director of F.B.I.. I think that if J.Edgar had been a school janitor who wore dresses, drove to work, had lunch, then dinner, went home with, and then went on holidays with same man, no one would doubted he touched up boys and he&#39;d been given life with out a 2nd thought.

<p>Further that the powers that be do cover up such cases is proven by Johnny Rotten talking about Jimmy Savile being a pervert 20 years ago while Saville was still at large. If Johnny knew and the interview was censored, then the powers at the BBC also knew and were actively protecting the man.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The article was published because of the impact it had on the establishment and the people who worked there. My f&#39;ing Instagram profile is dissected in one theory video because I commented on a post made by a friend of mine who works there. I&#39;ve been receiving a constant stream of messages and comments on my Instagram account from inane conspiracy theorists calling me a pedophile and a Satanist. It&#39;s all bullshit but it&#39;s had a real impact on people. I had no clue what it was and had no clue why I was getting messages telling me to kill myself because I&#39;m a satanic pedophile until someone sent me a link to the video. My friends and I were cackling watching the video I&#39;m featured in because he tries to tie pictures of Homer simpsons artist&#39;s comics and shoe boxes from Unif into his theory. The NYT article illustrates the fake news epidemic that&#39;s going on right now and how in some instances it has real consequences (i.e., pizza restaurant employees being harassed by tin-foil hat wearing keyboard warriors). </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I wonder why the Pope is advising to stop focus on &quot;scandals and all sorts of human failure&quot;, in an effort to not let &quot;tragedy of human suffering and the mystery of evil&quot; to become entertainment. Or did he mean evidence instead of entertainment? Interesting since there is a plethora of evidence showing that #pizzagate and elite pedophilia is a worldwide evil, going back for generations and deeply entrenched in the Catholic Church. There are plenty of allegations and testimony against Pope Francis, especially in years prior to becoming the Pope, regarding pedophilia and sacrifices. No wonder he&#39;d advocate for turning our heads to something else. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not really.  It&#39;s important to remember pizzagate isn&#39;t the start of this pedo ring.  Far from it.  In 1977 the Chicago Tribune ran a cover story outlining the John Wayne Gacy case.  They document that he was a patsy for a large national child trafficking ring.  The lead investigator found 30k index consisting of high profile politicians in Washington.  These index cards were the customer base.  What happened to the cards?  As you see in the article they were turned over to the FBI.  What did the FBI do with those cards?  They lost them.  Here is the link.  To question our credibility any longer implies that you are no fan of history or literacy. <a href="http://archives.chicagotribune.com/1977/05/16/page/1/article/chicago-is-center-of-national-child-porno-ring">http://archives.chicagotribune.com/1977/05/16/page/1/article/chicago-is-center-of-national-child-porno-ring</a></p>

<p>BTW from the outside looking in, it really does look like a witch hunt being driven by people with agendas.  </p>

<p>That is why some people are trying to put a stop to it because although today you are targeting a pizza place, they are afraid that tomorrow you might get fabricated evidence from someone with an agenda that leads you to falsely believe that it is their business or family that is involved in something horrific.</p>

Look up how pedophiles talk. They have a dictionary learn it. Then start reading they emails and tweeter. Also #chocolatecake had no food just a little girl playing. So maybe just ask why? Do some thinking and research. Now days there is no thinking just being let by the news but no independent thinking.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Strange, mothers are told that if they &#39;suspect&#39; [not know, not &#39;have evidence] to err on the side of caution. Yet when something strikes most people around the world as seriously dodgy, when jokes are made about selling children, by people with sexually orientated names we are supposed to shrug our shoulders and say &#39;meh&#39;?
All we want is someone to investigate and let us know that nothing bad is happening, but nobody is actually even looking into it. It&#39;s akin to tell a mother to eff off and not to worry, even if she has a strong suspicion.
We don&#39;t want anything more than someone to take a good, hard LOOK, so we can all sleep easier. Why is that not granted after everything out there that is at best done by really tasteless people, that should be exposed for what they are and at worst by paedos?</p>
