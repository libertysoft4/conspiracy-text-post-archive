<p>After they had been edited, <a href="http://archive.is/4J0Ae">The Washington Post runs this article</a> titled <strong>&quot;Fearing yet another witch hunt, Reddit bans ‘Pizzagate’&quot;</strong>.</p>

<p>Hey Everyone,</p>

<p>Yep. I messed with the “fuck u/spez” comments, replacing &quot;spez&quot; with r/the_donald mods for about an hour. It’s been a long week here trying to unwind the r/pizzagate stuff. As much as we try to maintain a good relationship with you all, it does get old getting called a pedophile constantly. As the CEO, I shouldn’t play such games, and it’s all fixed now. Our community team is pretty pissed at me, so I most assuredly won’t do this again.</p>

<p>Fuck u/spez.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I find it rather convenient that the time period referred to &quot;for about an hour&quot; happened to be the same time period that WaPo archived the post and linked to it in an article.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This reminds me of a story I heard on the moth radio hour Saturday night. This woman was telling a story about how her health insurance provider screwed her out of hundreds thousands dollars and there is a law (she cited the statute name &amp; number) prohibiting their act and told the audience 1) this is not a crime where you can call the police and they will do something and 2) the best deal she could find in getting an attorney to go after the insurance company required a thirty thousand dollar retainer she couldn&#39;t come up with.</p>

<p>As long as you don&#39;t commit a RICO act violation against somebody with government lawyers or a lot of money I doubt if the law applies to you. (Not A Lawyer!)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Because someone carried this over to <a href="/r/kotakuinaction">/r/kotakuinaction</a> - I&#39;m gonna teach you guys something about archives regarding that WaPo thing.  Go look at the raw link for the WaPo article.  It includes the direct link to the current state of that <a href="/r/the_donald">/r/the_donald</a> post, with the spez name restored.  Now click it from your archive above.  Notice how it goes to an archive still?  That&#39;s because the archive site tries to redirect you to an archived version of a page if it exists <em>before</em> it sends you offsite to the original link source.  You can test this on any other archived page that includes links which may be archived for other reasons.</p>

<p>While yeah, the rest of this shit is a big deal - the WaPo thing is not what you are making it out to be.  That&#39;s just bad understanding of the mechanics of the archive website.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>To do such a thing you have to have gone out of your way to implement such a system or do it the hard way.</p>

<p>Either the admins have the ability to login to the database and change the entry that represents the comment&#39;s text(I highly doubt the ceo has the credentials to login to a server that only some of the IT staff would ever have the need for let alone know how the db is structured and how to issue sql commands.) or editing other people&#39;s comments was built into the site. </p>

<p>As in someone went out of their way to write code that would allow an account with the correct permissions to edit the posts of other users without marking them as edited(which is far worse).</p>

<p>I remember seeing that Reddit&#39;s source code was up on GitHub although I have not bothered to look into it. Someone should really get on that to confirm whether or not the editing was a site functionality or whether the ceo did it manually.</p>

<p>Either way it his abhorrent and perfectly represents the Reddit staff&#39;s complete disregard for the free speech of its users.</p>

<p>We&#39;ve known for ages that they are corrupt but this is just a whole other level. It is impersonation.</p>

<p><a href="/u/spez">/u/spez</a> I really hope you understand exactly what you have done here. All it would take for Reddit to go the way of Myspace is if an alternative appears that markets itself as &quot;Reddit minus the shitty staff&quot;.</p>

<p>All you have managed to do is solidify that idea.</p>
