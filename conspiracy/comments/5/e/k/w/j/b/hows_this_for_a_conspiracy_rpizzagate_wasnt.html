<p>r/The_Donald and r/Conspiracy have some of the BEST/AWAKE redditors around. Those of us who&#39;ve been here through several scandals are fully aware doxxing is punishable and would never do it. If newbies had done it, our fully experienced admins would instantly &amp; immediately delete. There was no warning, and they have provided no proof of any offending post or TOS violation. Only accusations.</p>

<p>The screenshot lists only four accounts over four days.  If that&#39;s true, why didn&#39;t you mention this or show the screenshots until after the subreddit was gone?  What posts did they make after getting unmuted?  Why didn&#39;t you ban them from posting completely? </p>

<p>That&#39;s ignoring the inconsistencies in <em>their</em> projected motives.</p>

<p>For example, why would they even bother?  They never bothered with citations for fatpeoplehate, they just gave their side of the story.  Even if it <em>was</em> following the rules, the subreddit was specifically designed to investigate the personal lives of complete strangers, by what rule are they being held accountable that required it?</p>

<p>This election cycle was different though for a number of reasons, obviously. But we were diving into a huge conspiracy, and the amount of woke redditors on the_donald was growing exponential.</p>

<p>So now, take a step back and check out our sub.
We are legitimately investigating (as a huge open source community) one of THE biggest conspiracy theories in the game.</p>

<p>Make no mistake, Conspiracy of Silence, the Pedo/Occult/Satantic conspiracies are found near the bottom of the rabbit hole, and I think its extremely impressive to see this many people working towards this massive awakening.</p>

I created <a href="/r/pizzagate2">/r/pizzagate2</a> a few days before it closed as a means to back up the CSS and sidebar information in anticipation of reddit closing down the sub. I am not affiliated with <a href="/r/pizzagate">/r/pizzagate</a> nor a moderator of any other sub. I didn&#39;t post on <a href="/r/pizzagate">/r/pizzagate</a>. The day after it was closed, my private subreddit for which I was the sole subscriber was also closed down with the same message as <a href="/r/pizzagate">/r/pizzagate</a>. I didn&#39;t witch hunt anyone. No one was witch hunting on my private subreddit. I have no means to contest the ban either. Make of that what you will.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, just, no. The reason <a href="/r/pizzagate">/r/pizzagate</a> was banned was because you guys were going on a witch hunt, posting facebook links and all kinds of personal information that should not be distributed. And this is coming from someone who actually sees validity in pizzagate, honestly. </p>

<p>Just read the post that is linked when you go to <a href="/r/pizzagate">/r/pizzagate</a>, it clearly states that posting facebook links, private info etc. is not allowed. Pizzagate was simply a matter of policy, but what <a href="/u/spez">/u/spez</a> did is still completely unacceptable, I think we can all agree.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, just yes. Obviously you don’t understand the way r/Conspiracy works. Idiot. If we had proof it would not be a conspiracy theory, it would be fact. </p>

<p>You are side-stepping the fact that you have no proof either. You are just taking the word of u/Spez that there was doxxing happening on r/pizzagate. I frequented r/PizzaGate daily and NEVER saw doxxing happening. There was no witch-hunt going on, it was pure investigation. Heartfelt, genuine and by the books. </p>

<p>Besides, Hypothesis Forming is a key part of investigation. Thus far we have all circumstantial evidence, and that&#39;s OK. </p>

<p>I’m not asking you to just believe the post, I don&#39;t 100% believe it. </p>

<p>Come up with a more plausible counter theory. That&#39;s how you eventually find the truth together.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>there were facebook links, idk what to tell you man. Let me put it this way:</p>

<p>You guys were posting links to private social media, posting names and personal information ACCUSING PEOPLE TO BE PEDOPHILES!!!! Do you honestly not see what is wrong about that? People have a right to not be harassed by strangers on the internet and that is exactly what you guys were doing. Put yourself in anyone&#39;s shoes. How the fuck would you feel if thousands of people were accusing you of being a fucking pedo?</p>

<p>I know you guys are gonna hate hearing this, but leave the investigating to the people that are paid to do it. Don&#39;t trust them? Well, maybe you should become a fucking private investigator or something, but don&#39;t come crying when your little subreddit gets banned because you were accusing random strangers of being child molestors. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Is CTR prevalent on reddit?  I kept hearing that, and as &quot;evidence&quot; people pointed to anti-trump posts in the main subreddits.</p>

<p>But the site is left-leaning to begin with, and Clinton suffered <em>hard</em> during the primaries.</p>

<p>If CTR is a driving force, why didn&#39;t they have a foothold until she won the primary?  Why don&#39;t they have a foothold in <em>this</em> subreddit, you&#39;d expect there to be more people pointing out Trump&#39;s business associates.</p>

<p>this subreddit is way smaller and should be easier to manipulate than a huge subreddit like r/news.  We only see anti-clinton stuff here, and the regular non-political contributors are people who tend to spread stories on social media.</p>

<p>The CTR accusations don&#39;t hold up, IMO it was a false flag by the Russians to distract us from who was really manipulating the narrative.</p>

<p>I really didn&#39;t see anything in there that supports your narrative.  It does seem to indicate that they genuinely consider T_D to violate the rules, but are more concerned with public image than actually enforcing the rules.</p>

<p>When did I say CTR had anything to do with Russia?  </p>

<p>A pro-government narrative is affecting posts critical of Russia&#39;s actions, and completely controls T_D and conspiracy.</p>

<p>A major flood of pro-russian comments happens in every thread about russia in the major subreddits, but doesn&#39;t match the vote count of the large number of existing users, so they only stay at the top of the thread while it&#39;s relatively fresh.  </p>

<p>Articles critical of Russia are often downvoted before making it out of the queue in ways that don&#39;t affect other articles.</p>

<p>Are you joking?  The clinton emails talked extensively about all their opponents.  Did you even read the emails?</p>

<p>You can&#39;t even understand simple comments on reddit, you might as well give up on complex international politics.  By repeating all this stuff without actually checking for its plausibility you&#39;re just a tool serving the interests of TPTB.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m a systems designer by trade.  I hear what you are saying re: design.

<p>Keeping narratives, and keeping those narratives distributed, is The Way to handle this situation.  The advantage of narratives is that they can become canonical/well-known/well-understood/well-remembered, and thus unwanted mutations to them at various stages of the narrative are harder to actualize in meatspace as people are familiar with the narrative.   </p>

<p>Freeballing some thoughts.  We could use git repos as the way to keep narratives.  Each repo being a narrative or set of narratives.  Git would be the versioning sauce.  Distribution of narrative(s) would be as simple as forking a repo.  Add a layer to provide an API making this more domain specific to a forum thread / document thread.  Have single page html app that wraps calls to the git repo in a domain-specific way.  Also good place to add more narrative-y meta documents with each commit.  If server side validation was required, could nodify the domain specific api to do the narrative-y meta sauce stuff.  Hmmm.. </p>

<p>The components would be:
* A heavily modified bitcoin node that stores messages from addresses. We&#39;d have to figure out a karma/coin system to ensure people didn&#39;t completely spam the chain.
* A frontend website not unlike most bitcoin wallet sites to trawl the chain. Local caches could be used to increase performance. The frontend could look exactly like reddit/voat.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is possible, but to be perfectly honest I don&#39;t think pizzagate needed to be framed. When you&#39;re linking left right and centre to resources leading to these peoples&#39; social media accounts and loudly proclaiming them to be pedos and child traffickers, and growing as fast as they were... I think reddit just didn&#39;t want another Boston bomber situation. I&#39;m all for the citizen&#39;s investigation, but I&#39;m not suprised reddit shut it down. Dangerous territory when you&#39;re amassing a mob of people some of whom are 100% convinced the &quot;targets&quot; of the investigation are satanist child torturers.</p>

<p>I really didn&#39;t see anything in there that supports your narrative.  It does seem to indicate that they genuinely consider T_D to violate the rules, but are more concerned with public image than actually enforcing the rules.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>There goes that Russian narrative.</p>

<p>How does that not <em>support</em> the Russian narrative?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Also, CTR was mentioned in the wikileaks extensively, and so was Reddit. So wrong again.</p>

<p>Donald Trump was mentioned in the wikileaks extensively, does that mean he&#39;s a part of CTR?  Where and how are you making these connections?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m a systems designer by trade.  I hear what you are saying re: design.  In my opinion what we need is this: a document per narrative;  that document is appended to only as it mutates;  that document is distributed; each mutation can be validated by blockchain or some other way of ensuring the data is what it is, and hasn&#39;t been modified.  </p>

<p>Keeping narratives, and keeping those narratives distributed, is The Way to handle this situation.  The advantage of narratives is that they can become canonical/well-known/well-understood/well-remembered, and thus unwanted mutations to them at various stages of the narrative are harder to actualize in meatspace as people are familiar with the narrative.   </p>
