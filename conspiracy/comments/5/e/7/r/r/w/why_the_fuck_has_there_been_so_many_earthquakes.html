    <div class="md"><p>As I said, population control was just a guess. </p>

<p>You present an interesting theory though. I wonder if HAARP has anything to do with this? Was the earthquake machine patented prior to being &quot;destroyed&quot;? I feel like it&#39;d be naive to think his other inventions aren&#39;t being used today like the particle beam so I am definitely entertaining this idea.</p>
