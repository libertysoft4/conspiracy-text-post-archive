    <div class="md"><p>That is not true.  </p>

<p>I proved over a month ago they censored my images by caching redacted imagery from imgur AFTER they published the unredacted ones, and locked that post so I could not edit or delete it.  I have at least 3 witnesses who saw this, and one irl.  I was one of the first people to take multiple screenshots of hillary&#39;s greensboro NC glitching and I made a whole narrative about it, exposing it as a CIA operation by the cass sunstein playbook.  Someone apparently did not like this</p>

<p>I can&#39;t be the only one they&#39;ve done this kind of thing to.  I&#39;m not that special a snowflake.  Come forward others...let people know that steemit is control grid confirmed.<sup><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/4ztnja/steemit_is_control_grid_confirmed/">[1]</a><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/56q9vz/steemit_is_control_grid_confirmed_2_purposeful/">[2]</a><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/4ym8pl/steemit_is_probably_control_grid_the_litmus_tests/">[3]</a><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/4x54ij/steemit_selfcensorship_of_tag_conspiracy_it/">[4]</a><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/4x5tsk/corbettreport_video_on_shilling_out_of_control/">[5]</a></sup></p>

<p>edit:
People need to know...its timing is cuirious, they don&#39;t respond to people, and it&#39;s a whole ponzi scheme anyway.  It&#39;s designed to fracture reddit.  Defenders of steemit who have either willfull blindness or cognitive dissonance about it (ie: they have a sunken cost fallacy of swtichign over to steemit and liking it), say that the changes were &#39;interface level&#39;...that doesn&#39;t matter!  It doesn&#39;t matter if your post is in the blockchain or they are screwing with the interface--either way, they deranged your post in a propaganda way to inhibit your free speech.  Therefore this argument is invalid so please do us a favor and don&#39;t revisit it</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m rather new to steem so will definitely investigate.  Have you checked your post on the uncensored version running on tor? And seriously i doubt anything you posted was censorship material for steemit.  Anyway to clear things up steemit.com is fully open source and the STEEM has always been and is decentralized. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I know all those things are advertised as true, but used develop data-driven websites similar to fb and twitter for a living in php/js and I can assure you that I was made by my bosses to publish capabilities of websites that aren&#39;t true.  Especially at agencies....seo and video publishing... I know there are problems on the backend, and if you have the database and code access you can do anything.  We have got to stop taking everyone&#39;s word as scripture, just because they are ceos or they own the websites they run.   My screenshots and my experience are what&#39;s real to me, I don&#39;t care about any claims they make.  I checked my post on a VPN from moscow and it had the same problems.  I looked at the images on imgur and they were redacted <em>there</em> as well, which means that imgur was the source, however, they were not redacted when I posted, and steemit published the unredacted for about a day as I fwd this to other people via email.  They noticed it a day later and told me.  I checked on it and was super pissed off and very confused, given that I had also believed that steemit was not capable of this (re-caching redacted images after publishing unredacted imagery)</p>
