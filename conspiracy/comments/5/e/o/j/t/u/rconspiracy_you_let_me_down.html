        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>A computer scientist has claimed that the Russians could have hacked into the electronic voting systems of the United States changing the results of the election.  This has spurred Jill Stein to raise $1.5 million in one day to force a recount.  Yet, all you can talk about is pizzagate and the reddit admins changing a few posts.  The one article about the recount just has comments like Hillary lost, deal with it.</p>

<p>What happened to you?  When I was a kid we thought that George Washington was replaced by Adam Weishaupt, John Dillinger was actually five people and the reptilians from the planet Nibiru are taking over all mainstream media.  </p>

<p>I&#39;m not saying that the election was rigged, but I certainly expect r/conspiracy to say that it was.  What happened to the New World Order only keeping pennies around to collect samples of your DNA?  What happened to element 115 releasing antimatter to power faster than light travel in UFOs?</p>

<p>Trump just got elected!!  This should be a conspiracy theorist&#39;s wet dream.  For shame...for shame.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Im not saying there not &quot;real shit&quot; im saying that all of this is happening infront of our face. Idk what u were talking about with the pennies but thats not a concern when we have a real problem of suppressed media such as shutting down pizzagate. What you are saying about Trump could be true and we should also focus on that.  But dont put everyone down about pizzagate this is &quot;real shit&quot; and we were finding real evidence that just got deleted by a media company. If this shows us anything its that we are being suppressed and we beed to put a stop to it before every right of ours is suppressed. </p>

Here&#39;s the conspiracy with the election machines. It&#39;s widespread fraud since Bush was elected the FIRST time, it&#39;s criminal bankers and military industrial lobbyists, and a lying fucking executive office torturing people and assassinating civilians with murder drones. Russia is sitting back thinking &#39;wow... let&#39;s not let it get as bad as America, okay comrade?&#39;</p>
