    <div class="md"><p>Has he got anything else going on? </p>

<p>What I mean is, is there any other reason that he could have been put on the 50 Most Powerful list?</p>

<p>Who made that list and where was it found? </p>

<p>The reason I&#39;m asking is because there are lists and then there are lists. If you find someone in the Forbes 500, that says a lot about who they are. I could go ahead and put out my own list and put whoever I liked on there... but it just wouldn&#39;t carry as much weight.</p>

<p>If this is a &quot;Forbes 500&quot; type list, I&#39;d be interested to know the reasons for Alefantis being on it. But what if this is someone&#39;s backhanded way of saying that he makes great pizza and lots of powerful people are customers?</p>

<p>Can someone tell me about this list?</p>

<p>Bon vivant is french and means &quot;good living&quot;... but in this context it means someone who enjoys partying/socializing.</p>

<p>Going back to my original question about who came up with the list, this is GQ magazine. I kind of suspect they have a different idea of who makes it onto their top 50 list. More of an emphasis on socializing than hard political influence.</p>

<p>edit: I went back and looked to see who else makes that list. Here are some examples:</p>

<ul>
<li><ol>
<li>Svetlana Legetic, Jayne Sandman, Barbara Martin... Party planners</li>
</ol></li>
<li><ol>
<li>Stephen Strasburg... Pitcher, Washington Nationals</li>
</ol></li>
<li><ol>
<li>José Andrés... Restaurateur (not pizza)</li>
</ol></li>
</ul>

<p>Some of the people on the list are genuine heavyweights and some of them are there because hip/cool.</p>

<p>I think I heard he was dating John Podesta at one point? Or maybe they&#39;re just close friends? Not that dating a lobbyist should give you top 50 in DC power or anything, even if that lobbyist is super tight with Russia, Saudi Arabia, and the Clinton cabal. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Where there&#39;s smoke there&#39;s usually fire and they wanted/want that fire out badly enough to launch a coordinated media campaign to kill the credibility of pizzagate. Then go on to vilify the believers and begin an orchestrated attack on truth websites by tar-brushing them with the intel manufactured branding &quot;Fake News&quot; to drive off the interested masses. What you are looking at is a government directed, media propagated counter-offensive in the information war against the public at large. However instead of challenging the blatant and mounting evidence of a running paedophile network in their &quot;news stories&quot;, they instead launch salvoes of innuendo that point to nothing but vague generalities. They localise the circumference of the pizzagate investigations and then paint the perpetrator as poor, misunderstood victim, chosen at random by a wild, digital lynch mob.</p>

<p>Remember Alefantis is just ONE of many fronts for an organised, network of paedophiles who run high up the political predator chain. Twittergate corroborates this exposure as Twitter did nothing to the <strong>23,000</strong> Twitter user accounts of paedos trafficking child porn for months, but instead suspended the user account of Molly, the woman brave enough to report it all. She has stated that she has reported her findings to the FBI and law enforcement, but they have done nothing with it, much to her dismay.</p>

<p>Bottom line is MSM needs the public to believe the shit they are propagating in this coordinated offensive so they can diffuse the situation and lull the masses back to sleep. That way their paymasters and overlords can keep on committing their crimes of murder, trafficking and sexual assault unfettered by public exposure.</p>

Even if you 100% believe the conspiracy, can you not understand that someone who might NOT believe the conspiracy could see it as being harmful towards the potentially innocent people who work at this establishment?

<p>If you are not aware it&#39;s time to realise this. </p>

<p>They are allowed to push propaganda on the citizens. Never forget that. </p>

<p>So when the admin changes the users in the comments it&#39;s meant to make it look like the users are crazy and attacking each other. Doing that, to make a point to do that and to work that into a Washington Post narrative is to make us look crazy, like they always try to do.</p>

<p>Crazy conspiracy theorists all going nuts and witch hunting and fake fake fake, don&#39;t forget it&#39;s fake.</p>

<p>So Reddit admin is participating in An Actual Conspiracy along with The Washington Post.</p>

<p>A conspiracy to defame a group of people investigating pedophile cults.</p>

<p>If a person is skeptical of the MSM shouldn&#39;t that extend to other news sources? </p>

<p>For argument&#39;s sake, let&#39;s say those who did the research and gathered all that information is honest, can any of the information be verified as legit? People can make up anything. One can photoshop anything. </p>

<p>This is bait. They are setting Trumps base up. They are going to incite more vitriol and hateful rhetoric towards the poor rural people and anybody that likes Trump. They can&#39;t go after Trump for the time being. But they can go after his base. And they will. Remember they don&#39;t have to present facts, they simply have to be the first to say something. They have the megaphone and they still have the trust of many despite what just happened. And because like many overreacting to the pizzagate, the media&#39;s base can overreact as well, and they start accusing people of being things they are not. And then they feel justified in attacking or harassing others. </p>

<p>I really like the alternative viewpoints that some bring into these subreddits. I really don&#39;t want them to be censored or removed. People need to take a step back and get some alternative perspective. </p>

<p>edit: to your point on wikipedia. Wikipedia gets edited all the time. The same issues that reddit has with mod manipulation actually occurs in wikipedia daily. </p>

<p>Have you seen the video? It&#39;s an ABC news video from 2013 where the pictures are shown.</p>

<p>There is a definite conspiracy going on. If you want to defend the Podesta&#39;s you could say that Scotland Yard was trying to fool ABC news to damage the Podesta&#39;s in 2013. This sounds pretty tinfoil to me TBH, but it&#39;s a possibility.</p>

<p>Reddit is under a legal obligation to not have these accusations get out of hand or else it will get sued for libel/slander. You can&#39;t just go on a witch hunt because you think someone looks like a suspect. Most of you have little experience. You cannot harass a shop (like what happened at a day care years ago) because you believe it to be a ring for pedophilia. It&#39;s dangerous. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The court of public opinion is very different than the court of law. It is not limited like the court of law. Speculation and conjecture and heresy are allowed in n the court of public opinion. Sometimes that leads ti riots (see: Trayvon Martin media vs court transcripts, see: Brown, media vs Offical investigation, see: Rodney King, media vs court transcript.) The court of public opinion also tends to go into hysterics and have events such as witch trials. You can seriously destroy and individual&#39;s life or company&#39;s life if you simply accuse them of pedophilia. </p>

<p>I have looked at what is available and to be honest, it is all speculation. No real evidence. The only thing that could remotely be seen as reasonable are  the face sketches. It would be seen as reasonable to focus on Madeline&#39;s kidnapping instead of the alleged ring. You want to be seen as reasonable or whatever research anybody does in this matter will be outright dismissed. People confuse truth with credibility. People will believe who is credible, not necessarily who has the truth. </p>

Like all Christians, I await the return of God&#39;s only son, Jesus Christ, to truly &quot;drain the swamp&quot; when he defeats the New World Order before setting up his 1000 year kingdom on Earth. Ezekiel 7:4-6 &quot;And mine eye shall not spare thee, neither will I have pity: but I will recompense thy ways upon thee, and thine abominations shall be in the midst of thee: and ye shall know that I am the Lord. Thus saith the Lord God; An evil, an only evil, behold, is come. An end is come, the end is come: it watcheth for thee; behold, it is come.&quot; Matthew 18:6 &quot;But whoso shall offend one of these little ones which believe in me, it were better for him that a millstone were hanged about his neck, and that he were drowned in the depth of the sea.&quot;</p>
