They talk a good game as to not technically violate the terms of use but the fact is that they are all pieces of shit and the vast majority of them aren&#39;t there because they want to be inspired to seek help (give me a break), they are there to interact with other sexual deviants anonymously because chances are most of the people in their real lives would be appalled to know that their friend/family member fantasizes about abusing children.</p>

<p>Children epitomize innocence and purity; to think that there is a public forum here for those dirty bastards who would like to, or do, defile that innocence for their own unnatural sexual gratification is literally sickening.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Is pedophilia a sexual attraction towards children or an attraction towards hurting children? I&#39;m genuinely curious because I do see some logic in it being a mental condition that I&#39;m sure plenty of people don&#39;t wish to have. But it&#39;s a far cry from having sexual urges to acting on them. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m so glad someone is asking this question.  Pedophilia is an involuntary sexual attraction towards children.  Most people with pedophilia are not at all interested in hurting or dominating or exerting power over children, and most never act on their urges and instead live life without sexual fulfillment.  They are as uninterested sexually in their peers as most people are sexually uninterested in children.</p>

<p>Then there are other people - sexual predators and rapists who use sex as an act of power and violence against their victim.  Sometimes these victims are adults, and sometimes they are children.  Children are easier to victimize because they&#39;re helpless :( It&#39;s heartbreaking.</p>

<p>So, pedophilia =/= sexual predator, though some sexual predators are pedophiles.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, I <em>do</em> have science to back my claims up.</p>

<p>Here is a description of research on paraphilia, particularly pedophilia, by research psychologist Dr. James Cantor, complete with a list of peer reviewer publications at the bottom:
<a href="http://www.jamescantor.org/my-research.html">http://www.jamescantor.org/my-research.html</a></p>

<p>Here is a little background information from &quot;The Neurobiology and Psychology of Pedophilia: Recent Advances and Challenges&quot; published in 2015 in the journal Frontiers of Human Neuroscience
<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4478390/">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4478390/</a></p>

<p>&quot;Concerning sexual offending against children, two groups can be distinguished: first, those who show no sexual preference disorder, but whom, for various reasons, sexually abuse children. Reasons include sexually inexperienced adolescents, mentally retarded persons, and those with antisocial personality disorders (ASPDs), or perpetrators within general traumatizing family constellations, which seek surrogate partners in children (Rice and Harris, 2002; Greenberg et al., 2005). These individuals are most likely diagnosed with various impulse-control disorders, accounting for their engaging in child sexual abuse (CSA) without a specific sexual preference for prepubescent children (Allnutt et al., 1996; Greenberg et al., 2005). Second, there are those who do display a sexual preference disorder, namely pedophilia (i.e., the sexual preference for prepubescent minors) and/or hebephilia (i.e., the sexual preference for pubescent minors) (Seto et al., 1999).</p>

<p>Although this preference increases the risk of engaging in CSA, only about 50% of all individuals who do sexually abuse children are pedophilic (Blanchard et al., 2001; Schaefer et al., 2010) and not every pedophilic individual actually has abused children. The other 50% of individuals that have abused children are those who do so without a sexual attraction to children; i.e., they lack the necessary social skills to develop and maintain emotional and sexual relationships with appropriately aged peers and look to “replacement partners” in children as a kind of “surrogate” (Beier, 1998; Seto, 2008; Mokros et al., 2012b).&quot;</p>

<p>You can find many more scientific articles talking about pedophilia by searching on Google Scholar or PubMed.gov.  Before demonizing people with a disorder, consider having a little empathy and knowing the facts.  It&#39;s all too easy to label people as monsters because of crimes they might commit.</p>

<p>There is a difference between a child molester and a pedophile; just as there is a difference between a man that is sexually attracted to women and a rapist.</p>

<p>I like to use this analogy. Someone pisses you off and maybe you feel like punching them right in their stupid fucking face. Most people experience this feeling from time to time, but manage to keep their urge under control.</p>

<p>Some people can&#39;t control their anger and end up being charged with assault.</p>

<p>My point is: Feeling an urge to do something is perfectly normal. Being unable to control your actions is not normal.</p>

<p>So the difference between a normal, law-abiding citizen is not determined by one&#39;s urges/desires... it is determined by their ability to keep their personal conduct within the law.</p>

<p>I see a lot of rage comments here. To me, those are just people who feel like they&#39;ve got a justification to hate on someone else. If it&#39;s OK to hate pedo&#39;s, they jump at the chance.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There&#39;s no apologia here, but pedophiles are still human beings and some of them live completely normal lives in completely normal families, battling urges they have no control over until the day they die. I&#39;m not okay with Pedo subreddits, but we also can&#39;t demonize and sub-humanize pedophiles. The scary truth is that these pedophiles  decided to bite on a temptation or a little urge here and there, just for curiosity&#39;s sake...and then they became addicted to the rush of the taboo. We ALL have the potential to be one of these people(as much as some would love to proclaim their own righteousness). These people had lapses in self control and now they have to pay the price, but consider their plight, and see a little bit of yourself in their sick ways.</p>

<p>The issue here isn&#39;t attraction - it is consent.  A child cannot consent, therefore any and all sexual acts against the child are harmful.  Being attracted to someone is very different from sexually assaulting someone.  Just because a person might want to have sex with another person doesn&#39;t mean that they WILL have sex with that person, no matter what.</p>

<p>Attraction =/= desire to rape.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Good question, and beware of anyone peddling simple, easy answers to highly charged questions like this.</p>

<p>It&#39;s sexual attraction to children. The narrative being pushed is that it&#39;s entirely involuntary. I&#39;m skeptical of that, just as I am skeptical of anyone claiming that 100% of any sexual attraction is purely biological.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Took a trip over there and despite the good intentions I saw, that is no place for anyone who isn&#39;t actually a suppressed (so they say) peadophile.
The normalisation of such an abhorrent act was weird to see. I get it.. they&#39;re actively engaging in discussion as a means of therapy, I assume to aid in prevention of their urges. That&#39;s an act that comes from a good place, so it&#39;s to be commended. But when you consider their subject matter vs r/pizzagate, it&#39;s difficult to understand why both aren&#39;t banned. Pizzagate discusses <em>alleged child pornography</em> , whilst over there in r/peadofriends it&#39;s the real thing.
Weird huh?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Other subreddits created after PizzaGate weren&#39;t doxing and still are getting banned. Threads that WERE doxing in original PizzaGate were taken down by mods.</p>

<p>Pedofriends has a thread that links to a website that has pictures of random children taken from social media platforms that the pedos &quot;innocently&quot; look at and fantasize about. How would you feel if Reddit allowed a safe haven where pedos looked at photos of YOUR child? Or do you feel the same as one of them &quot;if your kid is on the Internet they&#39;re fair game&quot;. If that&#39;s true, isn&#39;t anybody circulating around wikileaks also &quot;fair game&quot;?

    <div class="md"><p>Because these sick freaks are everywhere, and some of them are most likely part of Reddit admin and mods. To give you an idea, Julian Assange&#39;s family was in the Children of God church when he was a child. So was the Phoenix family as in River and Joaquin, but their mother left because of the weird sex beliefs and pedophilia involved. Rose McGowan was also in this cult and has spoken against it. They changed their name to The Family International after arrests began to happen, and not too much later was when River was found to have died from an overdose. They also have an off shoot called the Family Care Foundation. These sickos are everywhere. The Children of God choir performed at the White House during Daddy Bush&#39;s reign and into the Clinton presidency. The Children of God church was started by a pedo named Berg who promoted pedophilia and even stated that the one thing he regretted was not having sex with his mother.</p>

Because they allow pedos to come to Reddit to discuss their urges, but ban a subreddit centered upon exposing pedos, it seems as though they&#39;re involved in one capacity or another with pedophilia.

    <div class="md"><p>if you are going to &quot;and once again&quot; at least fix the typo(s) from the first time..</p>

<p>There have not been any evidence of Doxxing occurring in <a href="/r/pizzagate">/r/pizzagate</a> .. The top sticky at <a href="/r/pizzagate">/r/pizzagate</a> was a mod post discussing the rule. The mods at <a href="/r/pizzagate">/r/pizzagate</a> did address sharing of private information. It was assumed that any public profiles and information/names in news articles were public not private. The only time children names or pictures were shown was when re-sharing public content from public social media accounts like instagram posts, including some insta posts geo-tagging the pizza restaurant, which had names posted in the photos and even sometimes hash tagged.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t believe &quot;Doxxing&quot; was the issue, the ban came from &quot;witch hunting&quot;... which likely only was a result of James whining to reddit after a small protest outside his restaurant of a few people from Philly occurred</p>

<p>I remember one of the big hooplas over rule was made over posts involving &quot;carisjames&quot; which was a hashtag used in several questionable public instagram photos. All <a href="/r/pizzagate">/r/pizzagate</a> posts referring to it were removed, just to be sure, even though it was determined to not even be the child&#39;s name</p>

<p>So to answer what you are confused about, the mods of the late r/pg did, just not to the degree that appeased the &#39;gods&#39;.. erm &#39;admins&#39;</p>

<p>Although by showing Admins like <a href="/u/Spez">/u/Spez</a> can edit user posts, would show Admins like <a href="/u/Spez">/u/Spez</a> have the ability to edit/remove/delete/ban specific users guilty of violating TOS rather than nuking an entire sub.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Its one thing when feds pretend to be &quot;drug dealers&quot; and distribute drugs in order to &quot;catch&quot; those who buy the drugs.. and usually some of the drugs get used and some go missing/sold.. all in the name of &quot;greater good&quot; catching the dealer/buyer..</p>

<p>Its one thing when the public is okay with feds selling guns to cartels in order to track and arrest the buyers/sellers...only to lose track of them and ultimately have one of those guns used to kill a border agent..</p>

<p>None of those are truly OK, even when attempting to argue &quot;its for the greater good&quot; and none of those tactics have put a real dent in the crimes they were policing..when do we draw the line? Do we really think its ok to create CP honeypots, or allow CP to exist for the sake of &quot;monitoring users&quot; simply to catch someone? It really just sounds like something that makes the public feel like the authorities doing something about the problem. Do they even let the public know of the success rate of these tactics? If they told you for every 100 pedos that view a CP honeypot we track down and arrest 1, would that sound like a successful tactic?</p>

<p>So fuck that tactic being applied to pedophilia. Also, I doubt they get permission from the CP victims to continue to use the &quot;seized evidence&quot; in future honeypots. </p>

<p>You don&#39;t give in to &quot;a little urge here and there, just for curiosity sake&quot; when it comes to touching a child or watching CP. Its never ok and shouldn&#39;t be tolerated.

    <div class="md"><p>How is talking about crushing on a 7 year old you babysit helping ANYBODY? Oh yes, I went to that subreddit. They talk about how little girls bathing suits are so sexy when you catch a peek. They have TEACHERS talking about students they have crushes on. They have BABYSITTERS talking about their crush and how the little girls have crushes back. They have people saying CP needs to be legal to suppress urges, because most CP is made with CONSENT and &quot;would never watch anything that wasn&#39;t consented&quot;. They have people that get angry when Americans call out Saudi Arabia for being pedophiles because over there things are different and how do we know the children aren&#39;t consenting?! They have people saying pedophilia is the same AS BEING GAY and therefor should be accepted by society. They link to another private pedo subreddit where there are &quot;less rules&quot;. They have a token 14 year old bopping around saying they love pedos and sex with kids is cool as long as they consent because it&#39;s LOVE, what do you have against love? Hell if you&#39;re bored, there&#39;s even a thread normalizing sex with CONSENTING ANIMALS.</p>

<p>Yep I went there. It is one huge (literal) circle jerk of pedophiles normalizing pedophilia. They want to FIX SOCIETY so they are no longer outcasts. Because, yes, that is another thing they discuss. It is apparently OUR FAULT that they&#39;re depressed because we think it&#39;s not good to have sex with children. They think pedophilia is bad only because our SOCIETY is wrong and THAT&#39;S why they feel guilty and the need to talk to other &quot;victims&quot; just like themselves.</p>

<p>Can you honestly tell me you&#39;re cool with that kind of culture on Reddit, but think it&#39;s okay for subreddits advocating AGAINST pedophilia to get banned?</p>
