    <div class="md"><p>There are no &quot;good&quot; people in politics. The powers at be would never allow it. If they see a rising incumbent, they will just have the national party pour funds into their opponent&#39;s campaign.</p>

<p>The only people that get elected are the people who play ball, and lack a moral compass. And with those type of people, everyone has some sort of dirt on them, or skeleton in the closet.</p>

<p>Politicians or coalitions of politicians probably have an army of investigators whose jobs are to dig up dirt on people to be used as ammunition, or to create fake dirt that would work just as well.</p>

<p>Power is about control. No better way to control someone tham through blackmail.</p>

<p>I think you are pretty on the money.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Do you even need to ask? No one ever questions <em>why</em> or <em>how</em> Epstein is a billionaire, it&#39;s just apparently accepted that he&#39;s a pedophile Jew-illionaire. Money isn&#39;t free and the easiest way to make a lot is probably to abduct some teens and sell their bodies to politicians. Film the politicians doing it without their knowledge and all of a sudden you have a lot more &quot;free&quot; money and favors.</p>

<p><a href="https://stirlospace.wordpress.com/2016/11/02/roy-cohn-the-men-who-made-donald-trump-ongoing-series/">https://stirlospace.wordpress.com/2016/11/02/roy-cohn-the-men-who-made-donald-trump-ongoing-series/</a></p>

<p>TLDR: Roy Cohn used underage boys as honeypots to get blackmail dirt on politicians suspected of being Commies. Trump hired him to help get shit done in New York. If Trump isn&#39;t implicated in this, at the very least he is well aware of the modus operandi.</p>
