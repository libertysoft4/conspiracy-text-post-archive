But theres not going to be the earth-shattering reveal event so many people seem to be hoping for. It is just not going to happen that way.</p>

<p>We have a call right now. There is a battle ongoing. They need our help.</p>

<p>There could be no better symbolic struggle against all of the parasitic, corrupt and lethal agents amoug our rulers- revealed and occult.</p>

<p>And our allies, our protectors, our #NoDAPL guardians, who are out there on the front lines of true popular democracy and community- and I even say of love- have a defining advantage: you cannot argue against what they stand for. Never, perhaps, has so blatant an affront to liberty and popular interest in the name of corporate power, wealth and immunity been protracted in front of our eyes and without answer to justice.</p>

<p>They fight for water. By extension they fight for the (global) environment wholly- which is under threat of &quot;exhaustion or collapse&quot;. They fight for millions of people to have water. They are fighting, nay, bearing the bludgeons, gas, bullets, dogs, psychological duress and countless other sufferings, of a domestic militarized police force. This militarized police force is clearly and simply the coersive arm of corporate interest, enjoying complete government complicity, against an enemy whose protection is it&#39;s reason for existance.</p>

<p>They will win. They will win or we will all lose.</p>

<p>We must help. In any way possible. With our support and our information sharing; with our ideas, abilities and enthusiasm; with our material support and with our bodies. And we must do it now.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Our struggle is to consolidate our autonomy, to build tight-knit relations of solidarity, friendship and constant reflection, to come together in defense against the attacks of transnational capital and the state as its accomplice, to establish new ways of living that are not mediated by capital and to defend the existing ones—such as those bequeathed to us by our indigenous grandmothers and grandfathers. The social movements organize to change the world from the bottom up.</p>

<p>Politics resides in action, in everyday life, not in some institution. Who has the right to decide on our present and on the fate of the population, on the commons, on work, on living conditions? There can be only one answer to this question: the common people. We decide and we do, we discuss and we act. It is not enough to simply resist. We need to exist again, to build here and now the world in which we want to live tomorrow.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Dude if the cover up surrounding the Dutroux affair led 300,000 Belgians to march in the street and still no one but Dutroux was convicted of a crime what makes you think this collection of creepy instagram posts is going to blow the lid off anythng?</p>

<p>If Jeffrey Epstein can serve 11 months as a convicted pedophile in a private wing of a jail with daily 16 hour &#39;work leave&#39; in which he was allowed to fly to his private island, how is this going to do anything?</p>

<p>There have been leaks of the the global pedophile underground pretty regularly since the 70s (the finders cult, Jimmy Saville, boy&#39;s town to name a few I haven&#39;t already) and every time it is succesfully covered up. If anything this incredible surge in popularity the comet pizza thing has enjoyed is intentional disinformation to draw our eyes away from the fact that both Trump and Clinton have ties to a convicted pedophile.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The protests concern me because it&#39;s another instance of militarized police abusing peaceful protesters.</p>

<p>However, the Indians don&#39;t have a strong legal basis to justify their actions. The Treaty of Fort Laramie of 1851 has been inconsistently enforced and violated by just about everyone (including tribes against other tribes) since its writing. It also gives the Indians vast swaths of Midwest land which they&#39;ve never claimed or defended. At this point claiming it&#39;s Indian land is about as legitimate as saying California belongs to Mexico. These are battles that have long since been won.</p>

<p>There are also some legal questions remaining to be resolved about whether proper approvals are in place for environment impact, etc. However, they don&#39;t have an injunction to stop construction at this point.</p>

<p>While I&#39;m sympathetic to the protesters, they aren&#39;t necessarily in the right. The response to them has been inappropriately disproportionate, but it&#39;s unclear what exactly the appropriate response is to people who won&#39;t stop trespassing. </p>

<p>With the paid organized protesting happening everywhere... and the manipulations I&#39;ve seen on facebook... I think DAPL was just a practice exercise... a warm-up to test how well they could mobilize an angry mob leading up to election night. </p>

<p>I&#39;m sure a lot of people are there on their own... but I feel like an outside power has influenced a lot to be out there... to whip up trouble. People that care about nature and the land shouldn&#39;t be burning tires and torching vehicles. </p>
