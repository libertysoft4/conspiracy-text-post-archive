    <div class="md"><p>PS-- Have a look at her Twitter feed.  <a href="https://twitter.com/donnabrazile">https://twitter.com/donnabrazile</a></p>

<p>I&#39;ve been watching it for weeks.  You&#39;ll notice some patterns.  Brazile uses <strong>her religion, her ethnic background</strong> and other people&#39;s comments to protect herself now.  She feels unaccountable.  If she lies enough and ignores her detractors, they&#39;ll simply go away.  Never mind the DNC is the most to blame for this election cycle, and for their role in destroying Sanders. </p>

<p>The most current comment is a re-tweet commenting on nazi&#39;s and racists anti-semites and bigots having some kind of meeting in DC.  Interesting that the DNC head should speak about fellow citizens in that way.</p>

<p>Brazile is also using Gwen Ifill&#39;s death in an unseemly way on Twitter.  She&#39;s not &quot;celebrating&quot; her life, she&#39;s trying to compare herself to Ifill and shouting down her detractors with a disgusting ploy.  It&#39;s nauseating. </p>

<p>Instead of looking at themselves and asking why they lost the election, they point fingers and blame everyone else. &quot;Fake news,&quot; Racism, Russians, etc.</p>

<p>Donna Brazile should be in prison for a subversion of democracy to meet her desired results. </p>

<p>If anything could be considered illegal voter manipulation its gotta be this.</p>

<p>The way to get this issue to gain more traction is by conflating Brazile with the DNC <strong>AND</strong> CNN. </p>

<p>That way you get CNN to issue a statement saying that they had nothing to do with the potential subversion of democracy and then the issue is at least in the news again. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Came from a strongly Democrat leaning background, and voted predominantly Democrat my entire voting lifetime. I do not recognize what the DNC has become, there is a sense that the party has been completely hijacked. </p>

<p>From my west coast Democrat leaning cable-car riding perspective, this infiltration has to be purged and the party returned to something recognizable before moving forward. </p>

<p>There was a good point made <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/5ebi9q/why_hasnt_the_dnc_fired_donna_brazile_for_her/dab6q02/">below by /u/DoYouEvenBrewBro</a> that we&#39;re having difficulty getting rid of the Wasserman&#39;s and the Brasile&#39;s because they know where all the skeletons are buried. In response to that one strategy might be to expand the review of what role everyone in the DNC was complicit, and shine some bright public lights, to draw attention to it. There are people down the chain that have future career prospects to consider. Raise the pressure across the organization so that it&#39;s more palatable to allow a sacrificial lamb as appeasement. </p>

<p>There was a wonderful visualization of the Podesta emails breaking down the connections within his contacts. It would be informational to review a similar illustration of connections within the DNC along with organization chart as a basis for exploring who are the players closest to Wasserman, Kaine, Brasile, and closer scrutinize what we know of them. </p>

<p>Wasserman and Brasile have to go in order to move on from the HRC campaign and bring back Democrats soured by the experience. The work Sanders is doing is solid foundation for the long-game that will payoff over the next decade. In the short-term we need more heads to roll within the DNC to send a clear message that this unethical &quot;we got to win this thing, not come out unscathed&quot; will not be tolerated. </p>

<p>Edit: Found it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>If the DNC fires Donna, they&#39;d have to admit their is a problem with their internal personnel.  The DNC is not done blaming everyone else and once they&#39;ve finished they might self-reflect and fire her. Though I doubt it.  The DNC is said to be primed to use identify politics with another female front runner soon. </p>
