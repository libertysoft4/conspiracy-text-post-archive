    <div class="md"><p>You know I have to tell you, I didn&#39;t buy your argument when I originally read your post, but something just clicked for me, and I think Im on board. U/spez might have been showing us what the government did, by mocking them himself.</p>

<p>&quot;If you can remove information you don&#39;t like that people say about you, than I can too.&quot; </p>

<p>In doing so, he exposes exactly what happened. Definitely a possibility. If that is what happened, it certainly raises some questions about him suddenly becoming a target of the whole pizza investigation.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>But corporate tyranny is always and everywhere enabled by the State. The State has the monopoly of violence. The State enforces cartels. The State absconds its responsibility to the rule of law. All tyranny, enslavement, deportations, war, crimes against humanity, genocides ... always arise out of the public institution, whether democratic or autocratic.</p>
