<p>When i did the same to telling that the localists in Hong Kong are all soros and hillary funded cronies which are preparing for a mass depopulation scheme, nobody seems to know it or recgonize it. (Although everyone i knew knows that the localists are evil.)</p>

<p>People in real life amazes me to no limit, for they are totally unable to see deception or deception in the way it should be.</p>

<p>It would be difficult for a happy go lucky and unarmed population to wake up to the deceptions of the world.</p>

<p>Also can tell them about the reason there is such a kinda proxy war in Syria, the pipe lines which could weaken Russias posistion because reduced trade of oil and gas to Europe. </p>

<p>And where do the rebels and isis gain weapons from, almost certainly not from Russia or syria or their real allies.</p>

<p>Putin also indicates that US is involved, or its allies like Saudi Arabia are involed in arming rebels and the opposition.</p>

<p>Putin also puts forth that ISIS has captured oil sites which they mine from then sell the oil, but to who, and why doesn&#39;t USA impose any sanctions on these countries who buys this oil.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sorry if I came across as rude and sounded like I suggested that Russia got monopoly on gas and etc trade to europe, what I was thinking is that the pipe lines would be created for the sole purpose of weakning Russia.</p>

<p>Another thing to consider, if the pipeline got built what hinders the saudi, qatar and such from prising it high. And some countries might just ban Russia from selling them oil and gas so Saudi oil and/or gas replaces Russia</p>

<blockquote>
<p>A man who was shot four times in the Orlando nightclub massacre told Local 10 News that he was crawling over bodies to get away from the gunman.</p>

<p>Norman Casiano, 26, was discharged from an Orlando hospital Monday, one day after a mass shooting that killed 49 people and injured at least 53 others.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>WTF kind of hospital discharges someone that&#39;s been shot four times within a day?  How does someone that&#39;s been shot that many times just stand up and walk away?  Did the shooter use a BB gun?  Same kind story with Angel Colon and a bunch of other &quot;victims&quot;.  How obvious can it get?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah and then you have the video of the people (civilians, not medical personnel) carrying an &quot;injured&quot; person toward, not away from, the club. And the only time you see someone get loaded into an emergency vehicle it&#39;s not an ambulance, it&#39;s a pickup truck. So it&#39;s not even a real emergency vehicle. There are no ambulances.</p>

<p>And one thing I&#39;ve recently realized about all these false flag shootings is the lack of people who are injured in the chaos in ways other than being shot. For example at Sandy Hook especially, you would have a chaotic situation where kids are running around in a complete panic, so you would have kids with concussions, sprained ankles, broken wrists, etc. But you never hear anything about that. I think it would apply at Pulse too.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>Orlando shooting did not happen as a shooting</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There was a huge amount of shooting.   I think the point is that it likely did not happen as widely reported.    The way the story has been reported fits a constructed narrative,   a<del>nd</del> no credible research has verified the official account,  on the contrary,  the anomalies of the incident and the follow up point to manipulation.</p>

<p>The problem of compassion is also there in Sandy Hook school in Connecticut or in the Boston &quot;bombing&quot; and others.    Its likely that there were actual cases of injury and/or death,  wrongful harm to the public in some or all of these cases.    False flags are hard to study,  but it is evident that the public is actually at risk.   The focus needs to be shifted to the possibility that the government (or shadow government) is benefiting by and manufacturing this risk.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>They divide hong kong society, infiltrate universities and education and are often presenting themselves with extreme threats (Same technique in Maidan Ukraine, Bolshevik Russia and Nazi Germany). If they can call the WHOLE Chinese ethnic slur &quot;Chee-Na&quot;, <strong>DO YOU THINK THAT THEY WILL HAVE ANY COMPUNCTION IN KILLING 4 MILLION HONG KONGERS?</strong> </p>

<p>This is basically Maidan Ukraine and Nazi Germany all over again, with Maidan happening in the same year where localist infiltration goes out of control. Not to say that the Illuminati have fat hands on those 2.</p>

<p>But there is a fact that basically everyone i know in Hong Kong knows that they are evil. Although when i told them Soros and Hillary sent them to destroy Hong Kong via proxy war, nobody seems to concur.</p>

<p>But one thing is for sure; Division via false unision is a very common tactic of the Illuminati when they want to destroy places, and i can easily smell all Soros tactics possible used to destroy Hong Kong via a radical ideology, waves of bloody riots, and all out proxy war. </p>
