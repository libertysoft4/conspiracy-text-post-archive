<p>And due to the illegals therein. We’ve proven 3 million illegals voted all across the country. A forced recount in any given state will start to out them. If Minnesota is recounted, for example, Trump may even win that. Half a million illegal somalis live there.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>She has to audit and prove the fuckery within just a couple of days in order to flip the still non-certified and closest races in Michigan and Wisconsin, although I believe it&#39;s already too late in Pennsylvania, which she absolutely has to flip along with the other 2 in order to prevail. In other words, this door has effectively already closed. </p>

<p>On the other hand, the best and cheapest shot at fuckery from here forward would seem the Electoral College on December 19th. 29 states, including MI and WI, have laws against <em>faithless electors</em> switching pledged votes (typically a misdemeanor and / or small fine, say $500). However, in MI the vote is vacated and the Elector replaced, so it won&#39;t really matter then if all of PA and WI Electors flip because Clinton still won&#39;t have enough votes to change the overall result. But if an Elector here and an Elector there starts flipping in more than PA, MI &amp; WI, most especially in <strong>the 21 states that have no law against faithless electors</strong>, well, then there&#39;s a path to fuckery.      </p>

<p>What’s your beef with Jews?</p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
<li>Are the Jews in control of Israel?</li>
<li>Do the Jews feel completely assimilated in America (like former Germans, Italians, Irish, etc.), or do they maintain a distinct national identity within that nation?</li>
<li>Is this national identity <em>neutered</em> of its sense of self-preservation, or is its sense of self-preservation alive and well?</li>
<li>Does this mean they have an agenda to <em>act upon</em> this self-preservation?</li>
<li></li>
<li>Are the Jews drastically <em>overrepresented</em> in the highest levels of politics and business?</li>
<li>Did all of these Jews just <em>happen</em> to reach these positions by their individual competencies, or is there a self-perpetuating Jewish culture at the upper echelons of America?</li>
<li>Could the Jews <em>hypothetically</em> use these positions to sway public opinion?</li>
<li>Do the Jews have anything to <em>gain</em> by using their positions of power over media, politics, and money to sway public opinion?</li>
<li>Does it <em>look</em> like public opinion has been swayed?</li>
<li><em>Has</em> it swayed in favor of the Jews?</li>
<li></li>
<li>With this in mind, go watch some Jewish-produced blockbusters and listen to Jewish-American politicians. Does it <em>sound</em> like they are pushing propaganda?</li>
<li>Do you detect a <em>pattern</em> in what you hear?</li>
<li>Is that pattern in or out of alignment with the direction in which society has changed?</li>
<li>Have <em>otherwise</em> respectable people spoken out against this in the past?</li>
<li>Have people who you believe (or have been <em>told</em>) are <em>not</em> respectable spoken out against this in the past?</li>
<li>Where did you get the <em>impression</em> that they are not respectable?</li>
<li>If you do your own research, do you <em>still</em> find said people to be unreasonable?</li>
<li><em>Who are you allowed to criticize?</em></li>
<li><strong><em>Who are you forbidden from criticizing?</em></strong></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
<p>Yeah the elite bankers are Jewish, but so what?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>How the fuck can you even ask that question? Hypothetical (not a claim about jews): “Yeah, the elite bankers <strong>subscribe to an ideology whereby they are commanded to purposefully hyperinflate all currencies and destroy the value thereof, regardless of the benefit to the people</strong>, but so what?” is the same question that you have asked here. THE BELIEFS OF A PEOPLE–PARTICULARLY WHEN SAID GROUP IS WHOLLY IN CHARGE OF A THING (media, finance, politics, etc.)–MATTER IN REGARD TO THE ACTIONS SAID PEOPLE WILL TAKE THEREON. This needs to be said?! This <em>isn’t</em> just something that is so beneath common sense that it itself, unspoken, forms the foundation of thoughts?!</p>
