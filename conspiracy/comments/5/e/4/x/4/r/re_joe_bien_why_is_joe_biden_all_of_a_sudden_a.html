<p>All of a sudden, Julian Assange went quiet, but before that, Joe Biden started yapping away his filthy mouth about various cyber capabilities of the United States, and I know he wasn&#39;t too fond of Julian Assange?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I read that Obama passed a law (in 2013 I think?) that would extend his presidency in the event of a martial law crisis.</p>

<p>We keep hearing from multiple &quot;anon&quot; sources that the info in the Wikileaks insurance files is SO BAD it will break apart our country,</p>

<p>When Wikileaks hashes no longer matched the most recent release, I thought that maybe they (Obama etc) had gained access to the files and had edited out all the parts that incriminated Obama. </p>

<p>They could then release the key, America would devolve into chaos, and Obama (who isn&#39;t implicated), would declare martial law and rule the United States as the shadow puppet. </p>

<p>BUT</p>

<p>With the increase of Biden memes, perhaps even Obama is too embroiled in everything to come out clean, so they plan on assassinating him (or impeaching him), and having Biden take over under martial law rule.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>He was a meme before that, but more of a doofus/fake-badass/fish-out-of-water type character.</p>

<p>While I generally remain unconvinced regarding most of the Biden stuff, the new batch of memes are pretty obviously forced memes.  They aren&#39;t quite funny, and they bend more to specific messages than a pure drive for humor.  They wouldn&#39;t normally gain traction anywhere.</p>

<p>They don&#39;t appear to be crafted to make him look appealing though.  And they don&#39;t run counter to the creepy message either.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>He&#39;s be perfect for 2020. Old yes, but still in the game. A lot of the memes are used to make him appear youthful.</p>

<p>He&#39;s a candidate that has some appeal, but they wouldn&#39;t really expect him to win. If Trump is strong they don&#39;t want to run their strongest candidate on an incumbent Trump. They also don&#39;t want to run someone so weak that the Democrats get even more laughed at.</p>

<p>You can then setup your intended 2024 candidate as the VP of Biden. He will take over if Biden dies in office. If Biden survives, then he backs out after one term and the VP is given quite a push in the polls.</p>

<p>Biden is the perfect candidate for 2020, unless Trump&#39;s presidency is weak and his reelection easily defeated, in which case he will be up against Cuomo.</p>
