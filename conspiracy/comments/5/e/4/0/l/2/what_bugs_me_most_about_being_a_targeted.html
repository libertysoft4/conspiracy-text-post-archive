        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>What bugs me most is when I was staying at my brother&#39;s house years ago they would sexually stimulate me during sleep many times with technology and now next to my ultra conservative Muslim neighbors (mostly induce porn sounds in their heads or phrases of me saying dumb shit) I rarely see my brother and I found out he&#39;d deleted me from facebook when I saw he added me back one day. He kept demanding evidence, called me crazy and that I need an education and I kept linking to good articles and patents, I was like screw that DELETE</p>

<p>It also kinda bothers me that they started hurting my friend with frequency weapons when I told him about this weird program...quite convenient that he was in a mental institution for a short period</p>

<p>And there&#39;s the terrible shock feeling in your hand while driving...</p>

<p>edit: About 9 months ago I found out I been a TI for 4 years and I&#39;m really broke atm, most of my problems is cuz of the targeting, haven&#39;t seen my mom for years, getting tortured every day and no one else believes the program could even exist and I feel a part of me is dying inside...I kept quiet till I started redditting and I was furious. I wanted more to know about targeting and tried to say anything I could so this is best I could do please forgive me if not up to your satisfaction. And I am not misinforming (a certain commentor..) I am relaying personal experience. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Tptb are occultists and psychopaths, trying to understand the reasons behind their actions can be frustrating and time consuming to say the least. Many targets sadly don&#39;t even know they&#39;re targeted or why. I think individuals with high energy,  stronger brain waves and high sensitivity to their technology are targeted to create more mayhem and for them to give out shit emotions.</p>

<p>edit  other relevenet posts on targeting: </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Reasons for being targeted vary and some are targeted just cuz TPTB want to study them and advance their tech (a lot of people with high cognitive abilities or who could help humanity in big ways are targeted) </p>

<p>-I want people to understand there is nothing very special about many targets and more people are targeted than you&#39;d think, to various degrees. Some of it is done for research purposes, the program is designed to make targets sound mentally ill and many targets have personal issues, a history of mental illness or were veterans, they are chosen for various reasons and most are people with not many connections to get this info out or who the public will not believe.</p>

<p>I think there is a &quot;spiritual&quot; aspect to some of the targeting or something our science cannot explain yet which I don&#39;t know enough about it. Something along the lines of certain individuals following their destiny or true desires, reality is probably a simulation, preset automatic paranormal experiences on cycles, automatic writing, portals, OBEs, entity contacts, weird stuff happening around some emotional people, synchronicities. I find this stuff fascinating    </p>

<p>Yes, it&#39;s all inevitably linked to the enemy at the root. (Satan) Since you seem to understand occultists have power, does that mean you believe the existence of Satan? </p>

<p>Regardless, all you can do is turn to God and rebuke the spirits and forces. Bless your house. Read the word. Pray in Jesus name. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I am still not sure about higher powers, so far I like the Gnostic&#39;s idea that there is a realty behind this reality, but I don&#39;t have any certain outlook on spiritual beliefs. I think everyone needs to find their individual path. I do believe in the significance of ritual however and if the bible works for you that is good :) I think it&#39;s something to do with encoding information into the matrix, I am still learning how reality works. </p>

<p>My first paranormal experience and targeting started at least 4 years ago when I started to meditate often and was active in spiritual topics online. Perhaps there is more to this reality and I was tapping into it, they induce very painful sensations whenever I meditate and needle prick feelings when I&#39;m between sleep/awake state which is when lot of paranormal activity happens.</p>

<p>(Just thought I should mention I don&#39;t really appreciate the know-it-all attitude most religious people carry, maybe it&#39;s cuz I grew up in Iran, regardless I think this world needs a better understanding of spirituality and I think organized religion is poison for the soul, people lose touch with the meaning. Plus it&#39;s never healthy to think you know everything about these stuff, always something new to learn)  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well your statement about my attitude kind of took me aback. I definitely don&#39;t have a know it all attitude lol. Forgive me if it came across that way. I am confident in the gospel and God though. The tone of my text shouldn&#39;t come across arrogant regardless. I really do care and am not replying just to be self righteous. Having said that, my replies tonight are taking an unusual umm I guess bluntish tone. If you read my older posts I&#39;m not usually like this, I think I&#39;m tired and yeah briefness is helping me organise my thoughts haha. Please keep that in mind as I reply to the rest of your message? ☺️</p>

<p>I understand you believe that to each their own. I feel like it makes sense for there to be an absolute objective good though tbh? Otherwise it&#39;s kind of your right against mine and if they go against each other then what do we do? Idk how to explain it.. so eh. All I can say is I strongly encourage you to seek God because He changed my life and I believe He can change yours. Jesus said, &quot;I am the <em>way</em> the <em>truth</em>and the life&quot;... It goes against our egos and our self-reliance culture but at the end of the day, we are all lost and seek meaning in life, so to know God we do have to humble ourselves and admit we need help in order for Him to help us. It&#39;s from God though so I mean... if anyone haha.</p>

<p>When you brought up meditation and implied you have delved (is that the correct spelling/word idk) into occultist stuff... well it does help me understand. I do believe and have experienced (and as the gospel confirms) the spiritual realm is real. Our world is directly influenced by Satan and God and who we choose to obey. (Obv this is my opinion, again excuse me if I&#39;m coming across as a know it all 😩 lol..) people don&#39;t realise that in sinning they are obeying Satan and giving him power in their lives. Anyway meditation and yoga are occultist despite what people think. They really do open your spiritual eye and because they are not spiritually of God (the Holy Spirit), it&#39;s demonically influenced. (I&#39;d encourage you to research it) It opens up doors and is basically an invitation for the Devil to have influence on you...</p>

<p>I actually read a thread the other day of a man (I think in r/Christianity? I commented on it if you want to look, but it would be a few pages back) who&#39;s child felt an evil spirit and he blessed his house and it went away (he was super surprised)... all the short pieces of advice in my last post at the end I believe are SO critical. It is written, &quot;For our struggle is not against flesh and blood, but against the rulers, against the authorities, against the powers of this dark world and against the spiritual forces of evil in the heavenly realms.&quot; Ephesians 6:12. I would encourage you to research the gospel (maybe scriptures related to certain topics to start?) and Google this all yourself. You have to seek God though and repent (very important) otherwise using His name and blessing etc won&#39;t work cause you haven&#39;t given Him permission to be in your life... </p>

<p>It is your choice, so it&#39;s completely up to you. But I&#39;m telling you what I wholeheartedly believe cause I do genuinely care. Jeremiah 29:13 🔑.. if you ask God for help and truly seek Him, you&#39;ll find Him. But again we have free will for a reason. I wish you all the best. Excuse my rambling and lack of structure... it&#39;s late lol. </p>

<p>And you&#39;re right. I&#39;m still learning for sure and learn new things everyday. Deception is all around. I trust in Him only and His Holy words.. ☺️</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m sorry...I think I have a bit of a problem with language in general, I just don&#39;t like &#39;naming&#39; spiritual forces especially something like god, it becomes like an object to be worshiped I&#39;m not sure how to explain, The begining of The Tao Te Ching says: The Tao that can be told is not the eternal Tao. The name that can be named is not the eternal name. The nameless is the beginning of heaven and Earth. The named is the mother of the ten thousand things.  </p>

<p>Edit: I think the nature of the false reality matrix is summurized in that quote...different meanings, associated with certain feelings that we give to all things created from the same source, it&#39;s like each individual experiences life from a filter or a certain viewpoint which gives meaning and life to life itself but is also it&#39;s own undoing. wow the structured order of how things work is beautiful</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You didn&#39;t define TPTB. What is TPTB?</p>

<p>If by TPTB you referred to perpetrators, they are neither occultists nor psychopaths. See the perps wikis in <a href="/r/targetedenergyweapons">/r/targetedenergyweapons</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Many targets sadly don&#39;t even know they&#39;re targeted or why.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>False. Cite the URL of testimonies by TIs that they don&#39;t know why they are targeted. Cite survey analysis that TIs don&#39;t kow why they are targeted. If you cannot, stop lying.</p>

<p>Cite sources that targets don&#39;t know they are targeted. If you cannot, stop lying.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I want people to understand there is nothing very special about many targets and more people are targeted than you&#39;d think</p>
</blockquote>

<p>How do you know there is nothing special about many targets. Cite the URL of testimonies of TIs that you believe are not special. The population of TIs is very tiny.  Reasons TIs gave for being targeted are:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/TargetedEnergyWeapons/comments/3s800w/report_here_why_the_tis_you_know_and_you_are/">https://www.reddit.com/r/TargetedEnergyWeapons/comments/3s800w/report_here_why_the_tis_you_know_and_you_are/</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>(a lot of people with high cognitive abilities </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Cite testimonies by TIs who stated they were targeted because they were highly intellient. Cite a survey analysis. TIs are targeted due to their profession and/or activities, not based on their intelligence.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>some are targeted just cuz TPTB want to study them and advance their tech</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What is TPTb? Cite sources TIs are randomly targeted for study or stop lying.  TIs are targeted because they are activists, plaintiffs, whistle blowers, journalists, etc. See the perps: goals wiki in <a href="/r/targetedenergyweapons">/r/targetedenergyweapons</a>. After TIs are targeted due to their activities, the TIs who are tortured are also subjects in medical experiments.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I think individuals with high energy, stronger brain waves and high sensitivity to their technology </p>
</blockquote>

<p>You keep saying that in your posts but don&#39;t explain it nor cite sources.  Stronger brain waves do not exist. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>the program is designed to make targets sound mentally ill and many targets have personal issues, a history of mental illness or were veterans,</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Cite testimonies by TIs and survey analysis evidencing TIs have a history of mental illness or were veterans. Stop making up stories.</p>

<p>TPTB (the powers that be)</p>

<p>Targeted individuals (TIs) don&#39;t use the term &quot;the powers that be.&quot; Why are you if you are a TI?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I read many places that targets don&#39;t have a reason to be targeted and think they were chosen randomly</p>

<p>thought it was a known thing between TIs that SOME are chosen randomly.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No. TIs are not chosen randomly.  I have read almost all TI websites, TI blogsites and TI subs. There are not many places that allege there are no reasons why TIs are selected and TIs are selected randomly. </p>

<p>Just because you didn&#39;t save URLs is not an excuse for not remembering where you read what you think you read.  I often copy entire articles and URLs into plain text files to read off line to determine whether to link post to them on reddit.  Articles I do not save, I can easy find again by searching key terms. Don&#39;t be lazy, search for your key terms. Search for the articles you had read. If you can&#39;t cite sources, retract your allegations.</p>

<p>Reasons why TIs are targeted are:</p>

<p>Report here why the TIs you know and you are being targeted</p>

<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/TargetedEnergyWeapons/comments/3s800w/report_here_why_the_tis_you_know_and_you_are/">https://www.reddit.com/r/TargetedEnergyWeapons/comments/3s800w/report_here_why_the_tis_you_know_and_you_are/</a></p>

<p>Reasons why TIs are targeted are in the survey questionnaire in <a href="/r/targetedenergyweapons">/r/targetedenergyweapons</a>. Volunteer to create a surveymonkey. Volunteer to answer the survey questionnaire. Volunteer to analyze the survey answers.  Then you can cite the survey analysis as evidence.</p>

<p>Why did you link to John Finch&#39;s letter? What was your point? If you cite a source, you must explain how the source evidencing your claims. Quote the text. John Finch had not substantiated any of your claims. John Finch had not discussed whether TIs know why they are targeted.</p>

<p>If you intended to refer the testimonies that John Finch collected, you need to cite the names and URLs of the testimonies in which TIs have stated they don&#39;t know why they were targeted.</p>

<p>I created a rebuttal which is preserved in the rebuttal wikis. It can be found easily to refute you or others if this disinformation is posted on reddit again:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>cuz there&#39;s so many TI groups now and organizations dedicated to protecting people from covert harassment, it&#39;s obvious to me this is a major problem.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You didnt list TI organizations. Why didin&#39;t you? There are very few TI groups and organizations. These few groups have few members. Few groups and few members does not evidence a major problem. See the groups wikis in <a href="/r/targetedenergyweapons">/r/targetedenergyweapons</a> and my rebuttal:</p>

<p>What is a gatekeeper?</p>

<p>I am educating you. I am not wasting your time. You are wasting <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> subscribers&#39; time. You are a pathological liar and keep on lying despite my asking you to cite evidence. </p>

<p>I defended <a href="/u/5arge">/u/5arge</a> from your attacking him. That does not make me a disinformant. </p>

<p>You didn&#39;t debate regarding youtube videos. Why did you imply you did? Cite the permalinks of your debate.</p>

<p>Regarding rules on youtube videos, see the transcripts wiki in <a href="/r/targetedindividuals">/r/targetedindividuals</a> and <a href="/r/targetedenergyweapons">/r/targetedenergyweapons</a>.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Finally someone with some sense came to comment. I was wondering how comments about TI and torture became Satan controls their intentions to torture and meditation is occult activity. Nonsense. 
I agree with what <a href="/u/microwavedindividual">/u/microwavedindividual</a> had to say in response.
If i ask my torturers why I am targeted, I get varied answers: My name came up on a list, I&#39;m female, have PTSD, any number of excuses. I don&#39;t know the real answer.
I believe if someone is targeted, after a while they know it. The strange symptoms and weird coincidences and happenings lead to googling the answer. I was familiar with mk ultra stories and human experimentation. I have suffered for decades, and this is not a phase I&#39;m going through where it&#39;s cool to say I am a target. I don&#39;t want to be but i don&#39;t have a choice.
I&#39;m currently writing a novel about my experience and while they say they wont hurt me for doing so, they slack my attention and motivation to really slow down my progress.
It isnt about God or Satan or meditation or the occult and those personal beliefs are separate from what is taking place physically, emotionally, and mentally.
Misleading and misinformation is what creates the paranoid tin-foil hat jokes about the situation. Maybe more would try to understand and believe if our truths were not skewed.</p>

<p>Illuminati theorists invented street theatre. Unfortunately, targeted individuals read books and articles by illuminati theorists and parroted them without citing sources.

Covert surveillance is described in the geo-stalking wikis in <a href="/r/targetedenergyweapons">/r/targetedenergyweapons</a>.

    <div class="md"><p>So sad to see individuals reporting these events and even in a conspiracy sub, that people would be doubtful or dismissive. </p>

<p>So many here believe Sandy Hook was a FF, yet can&#39;t see the jump between some individuals who are online often being targeted and &quot;tested&quot;, vs those who were obviously well-manipulated before. They look for loners or vulnerable people as an asset, even if just testing the efficiency of the technology. You think flouride and chemtrails are just about suppressing the pineal gland or for crowd/weather manipulation? </p>

<p>Naw, it&#39;s about getting access to the electrical wiring inside our muscles, organs and nerves. And now watch someone diagnose me as schizophrenic for talking about a subject that makes them uncomfortable... </p>

    <div class="md"><p>TBTB was a spelling mistake, I meant TPTB (the powers that be) I read many places that targets don&#39;t have a reason to be targeted and think they were chosen randomly, I am not lying, there were so many instances I did not save any links cuz I understood early the ruthlessness of the torturers and thought it was a known thing between TIs that SOME are chosen randomly.  </p>

<p>cuz there&#39;s so many TI groups now and organizations dedicated to protecting people from covert harassment, it&#39;s obvious to me this is a major problem. </p>

<p>really that you back 5arge is the last piece I needed to know you&#39;re a gatekeeper here, stop wasting my time it&#39;s the internet with information every where, it&#39;s like when we debated why I think you shouldn&#39;t remove youtube videos with false comments, people aren&#39;t as gullible as you think and I won&#39;t do what you want me to on subs you don&#39;t own and sorry if that bothers you</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Finally someone with some sense came to comment. I was wondering how comments about TI and torture became Satan controls their intentions to torture and meditation is occult activity. Nonsense. 
I agree with what <a href="/u/microwavedindividual">/u/microwavedindividual</a> had to say in response.
If i ask my torturers why I am targeted, I get varied answers: My name came up on a list, I&#39;m female, have PTSD, any number of excuses. I don&#39;t know the real answer.
I believe if someone is targeted, after a while they know it. The strange symptoms and weird coincidences and happenings lead to googling the answer. I was familiar with mk ultra stories and human experimentation. I have suffered for decades, and this is not a phase I&#39;m going through where it&#39;s cool to say I am a target. I don&#39;t want to be but i don&#39;t have a choice.
I&#39;m currently writing a novel about my experience and while they say they wont hurt me for doing so, they slack my attention and motivation to really slow down my progress.
It isnt about God or Satan or meditation or the occult and those personal beliefs are separate from what is taking place physically, emotionally, and mentally.
Misleading and misinformation is what creates the paranoid tin-foil hat jokes about the situation. Maybe more would try to understand and believe if our truths were not skewed.</p>
