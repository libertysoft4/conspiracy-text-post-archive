<p>So.... is &quot;going after&quot; &quot;net neutrality&quot; supporting of the people&#39;s free and censored/blocked internet, or is it supporting the censorship and control of the internet?  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Totally get the point, we get tons of doublespeak today(you brought up my favorite: right to work).  I think what we have to do is inspect the insides of everything and come out with a position on it.  The ACA, we knew it would end up being pretty expensive for a lot of people especially when the best part of it was left up to states to decide.  Right to work, you can simply see what the true meaning of that is just reading a tiny bit about it.  With net neutrality, I&#39;ve inspected and for me its something I really want to keep.  I can&#39;t justify giving corporations the right completely block parts of the internet from its users if it so chooses too.  Can you imagine if to get to alt-news sites you had to pay an extra fee, or have the speed throttled so its unusable?  This would give corporations a whole new way to control the masses and make finding the truth even harder for normal people.  I can also see the commodification of websites even further, for example, to access youtube you will have to by the Google™ internet package extra.  I just can&#39;t see giving these corporations that much power and having them use it for good.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>i don&#39;t see why we can&#39;t consider this a country of sorts, idk about any of you, but i feel i reside more in my head than say, my arm, or my torso. when we are all discussing something, it resonates in a way that is not dissimilar to people having a conversation in physicality. We discuss things online as though we were talking amongst if not true friends, comfortable acquaintances. We speak boldly our views,  make offhand jokes, and try to sort through the murk, We do this, together, Without the membership fees and chains that comes with the unions, without the special jackets, emblazoned with silk thread, in shapes of ancient ties. We come together, here.. in this space, differing religions, genders, sexualities, colors, we come together and dominate this &quot;space.&quot; </p>

<p>if we were all on one continent, we would be unstoppable and that is how they have forced our tempered compliance. We now have this. And in ten years time, we have changed the world, perhaps it is time to change our definition of &quot;citizen.&quot;</p>

<p>take heart, people. we&#39;ve got this. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>From my understanding we can work around the nodes you mention. We can make new nodes. There is no way they can completely shut off the internet, especially in a &quot;first world&quot; country. There&#39;s also the &quot;dark web.&quot;</p>

<p>They would shut down the internet. Immediately pissing off pretty much every nerd in the world. All the &quot;hackers&quot; would come out of the wood work and act as ISPs. That would happen literally overnight. What will take time is educating the super newbs in the &quot;new&quot; format. As far as actual content is concerned, we would probably have a better internet than exists now.</p>

<p>Maybe you&#39;re too young, but remember back in the day, like late 90&#39;s early 2k when you could find really useful &quot;fringe&quot; stuff on accident because search results were actually honest, and not just trying to sell you crap. It would be even better than that, with faster bandwidth because we would still have the updated tech.</p>

<p>I really don think an internet shut down will even be attempted, let alone actually be accomplished, short of all out global war an civil unrest. Precisely because a potential consequence of doing so would probably cause global war and civil unrest.</p>

<p>They are just going to try and dumb the internet down so it&#39;s like flipping though channels on late night tv without cable. When you&#39;ve made it past the learning curves though, that situation is irrelevant to you.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Now you&#39;re getting the idea. There will most definitely be a false flag. Anyone seen the movie &quot;live free die hard&quot;?. It&#39;s a great propaganda movie starring Bruce Willis, about how everything is essentially now controlled with computers. In this film, a group of rogue hackers are able to wreak havoc on DC. I believe they even use the term &quot;domestic cyber terrorist&quot; in the movie. That came about in 2007, they usually try to prime and program the population with films before these things Happen, providing you with a familiarity with the subject, and more likely to get your support for the Internet regulation to stop this &quot;cyber Terrorism&quot;, you recall seeing in an action film years ago...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Which if executed correctly, would be an amazing thing.  Plugging in every American directly into the political system.  Open transparency on politicians, using live streams and other technology to spread news and information about the political process.  What a powerful tool that would be!!!!</p>

<p>However, we should know better.  If Facebook were controlled much like a jury in America (tax-paying, law abiding citizens formulating their own independent opinion on something using facts) then a system like that might actually work.   Won&#39;t be the case though.  The system would only become corrupt and Facebook as a government propaganda machine would be far more effective and controlling than our current propaganda mouthpiece, the main stream media via TV and radio.  </p>

<p>After the recent 2016 election process (from primaries to inauguration).........  it sure feels like it.  Obviously not &quot;everyone&quot;, because any generalizing statement like that is wrong.   The_Donald is full of non-Americans who are following Trump because they feel the same political movement is necessary in their country.  Like most times in History, the rest of the world follows the West.   Like it or hate it, that&#39;s the way it is.

<p>The US is often in world news stories because they do impact many places through conflict and such (creating ISIS by destroying Iraq, and the following European Migrant Crisis etc) but not because they are some beacon of progress to follow. Russia and China are not following America&#39;s lead. </p>

    <div class="md"><p><a href="http://i.imgur.com/9zAj27j.png">Here&#39;s</a> another good post about this. The government is essentially powerless. If they try to &quot;fuck us into the stone age&quot;, as you put it, it would create a power vacuum. Other world powers such as China or Russia would try to take over the US. The government can&#39;t attack us otherwise, for fear that everyone could carry a gun. The moment they decide to try anything major, the whole country will be against them. </p>

<p>They can&#39;t destroy infrastructure, and they can&#39;t attack us en masse for fear of resistance from other countries. And they can&#39;t subjugate us, because the moment they do, someone will be shot. This is why we have the second amendment, and why so many of us fight to defend it. And why false flag events like Sandy Hook and Aurora happen, the globalists are capitalizing on past tragedy in order to weaken us, and force us to submit our rights. </p>

<p>They already tried with Clinton&#39;s assault weapon ban and it didn&#39;t work. They just tried to put another Clinton in, and it didn&#39;t work. That won&#39;t happen, because the moment they do, all pressure to enforce our constitutional rights is lost. I imagine that something major is going to happen in the near future, one last attempt. Whatever it is, we&#39;ll all have to stand strong. Stay informed, build and enforce our emergency food and water supplies, and be active in the democratic process.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was 5 when I had 2 head injuries, my mom was sold drugs to help her control kids because she had more than she could handle. She admitted it when I was coerced to apply for benefits. I feel like any parental figure is a drill sergeant telling me to dig a hole and the other one to fill it, eventually I just keep going on when I live inside my head. Of course I live with people who have narcissistic tendencies. Also repression? I get more of a push/pull when religion is brought up since I refuse to keep a label. I don&#39;t identify with anything because why does this exist? Why is everyone I talk to only help me enough to get by like a beggar, but only if I stay silent. I&#39;ve been through a job workforce program for over 8 years before I realized they didn&#39;t want to help place me. Doesn&#39;t help my mood when there&#39;s a death in the family, uncle who was helping ill grandma was also siphoning money from her. I wasn&#39;t allowed to go the the funeral because being at Grandma&#39;s is only for my sister and her, since I can&#39;t go. I&#39;ve let go of the idea that my sister is a certain archetype but she hasn&#39;t seem to let go of any of her ideas of me. But to watch my family die and to be left without an opportunistic person just sucks. The nightmares I&#39;ve gone through suggest I&#39;m an easy target, no other explanation other than I&#39;m supposed to be a slave type. Oh and karma? Only thing I could think of is being part of a major bloodline. Does my empathy levels make waves on their end? I&#39;m pissed at all the misery we perpetuate on each other. I was brought up to believe we had &quot;free agency&quot; but that&#39;s sketchy to rebrand free will. Like how we rename rocky mountain oysters.</p>

<p>Religion isn&#39;t always a system of control, it can be good as well. It&#39;s just that it&#39;s easy to take advantage of. My church actively encourages people to keep food storage, prepare, and runs its own canneries, farms, storehouses, and cattle ranches. </p>

<p>And also encourages you to avoid addicting or manipulative substances like alcohol, drugs, and to maintain a healthy life style. </p>

Obama for instance just got a 60 million (a milestone btw) for a book deal from Penguin. Sounds like a big payoff to me. Is it just me, or does anyone else here think that a president shouldn&#39;t be getting millions for a book deal, let alone any book deal such as this, especially right out of the gate of leaving the white house (sounds like a bribe to me).
