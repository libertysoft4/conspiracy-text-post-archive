<p>There&#39;s far more evidence of subreddits and shills protecting pro-DNC narratives than there is of Republican or general right-leaning shilling on Reddit. Everything from Correct the Record/ShareBlue issuing literal press releases about their activity on Reddit to the abrupt shut down of <a href="/r/SandersForPresident">/r/SandersForPresident</a> to examining the type of content that is banned in alleged neutral subs like <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a> suggests a deliberate, widespread effort on Reddit to protect the DNC agenda.</p>

<p>There&#39;s far more evidence of subreddits and shills protecting pro-DNC narratives than there is of Republican or general right-leaning shilling on Reddit. Everything from Correct the Record/ShareBlue issuing literal press releases about their activity on Reddit to the abrupt shut down of <a href="/r/SandersForPresident">/r/SandersForPresident</a> to examining the type of content that is banned in alleged neutral subs like <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a> suggests a deliberate, widespread effort on Reddit to protect the DNC agenda.</p>
