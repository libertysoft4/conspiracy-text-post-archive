    <div class="md"><p>I always liked Snopes. Until the 2016 primaries and election. They defended Hillary Clinton every step of the way during her campaign.

    <div class="md"><p>That Daily Caller article is garbage, though.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Before writing for Snopes, Lacapria wrote for Inquisitr, a blog that — oddly enough — is known for publishing fake quotes and even downright hoaxes as much as anything else.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_fallacy">association fallacy</a>. Briefly writing for a site that sometimes publishes hoaxes =/= publishing hoaxes.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Her columns apparently failed to impress her readership, oftentimes failing to get more than 10-20 shares.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What does this have to do with anything?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>She wrote a “fact check” article about Jimmy Carter’s unilateral ban of Iranian nationals from entering the country that looks more like an opinion column arguing against Donald Trump’s proposed Muslim ban.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>&quot;It looks like an opinion column to me&quot; isn&#39;t proof of anything, and is also an opinion itself.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Lacapria claimed Clinton only meant to refer to the 2011 invasion of Libya (but not the 2012 Benghazi attack) but offered little fact-based evidence to support her claim.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So a <a href="http://www.snopes.com/hillary-clinton-benghazi-msnbc/">full video with context</a> is &quot;little fact-based evidence&quot;?</p>

<p>Except, Snopes did write an <a href="http://www.snopes.com/report-vermont-power-grid-infiltrated-by-russian-hackers/">article</a> debunking WaPo&#39;s claim, just not immediately. As someone who visits the site pretty regularly, I&#39;ve noticed they usually take a while to debunk new stories, so this isn&#39;t really out of the ordinary.</p>

<p>(Besides, why would it be a priority to them to debunk something WaPo retracted?)</p>

<p>How did Snopes lie? The Daily Caller claimed there were no American flags whatsoever at the DNC. That turned out to be false.</p>

Watch the raw video yourself and draw your own conclusions. Don&#39;t let literal prostitutes tell you what to think.</p>

<p>The DNC quickly added flags on Day 2 and beyond because of the withering criticism they received on Day 1. Good luck finding that story on Snopes, though, who continues to lie about it until this day.</p>
