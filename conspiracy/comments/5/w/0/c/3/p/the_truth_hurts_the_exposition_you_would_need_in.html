        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>One of the most controversial things you can do is tell the truth. It can be considered impolite… awkward… socially unacceptable. The reason is very simple; the truth hurts.</p>

<p><a href="http://i.imgur.com/Cxd81tZ.jpg">http://i.imgur.com/Cxd81tZ.jpg</a></p>

<p>The Great Scam isn’t that difficult to understand and once you know the truth, many new things begin to make sense. The Great Scam is merely a matter of implementing textbook psychological principles on a wide scale while eliminating competition through direct action. </p>

<p>Politics, today, is the logical conclusion of this race for psychological influence. From Freudian Object Relation Theory to Wilfred Bion’s Basic Assumption Theory, they are applied by think tanks like the Brookings Institute, who refer to the collection of techniques as “Applied System Psychodynamics.”</p>

<p>It sounds fancier than it really is. People make assumptions because knowing every detail is impossible. Influence can be gained by exploiting and massaging these basic assumptions.</p>

<p>When we interact with people, we unconsciously assign assumptions about our relationships with others and the relationships between other people that don’t necessarily involve us. We see a couple and we make assumptions about their interactions and how we should interact with them. We see an authority figure and we make assumptions about how credible we should find them. We see a child and we assume a dependency relationship then act accordingly.</p>

<p>When the news presents a story, if you notice them trying to mess with your basic assumptions, you can guarantee it is a conscious effort on their part.</p>

<p>The most vexing thing about exploiting basic assumptions is that knowing isn’t any kind of defense. There are only two defenses. Being stubbornly set in your own ways (while hoping that your ways aren’t a product of early manipulation) or consciously deciding on a path of healthier basic assumptions that improve your quality of life.</p>

<p>Mark Twain understood this when he said, “It is easier to fool people than to convince them they’ve been fooled.”</p>

<p>The US Air Force and the Tavistock Institute of Human Relations did a study on how to better sell war bonds to people during World War 2. They called it, “Some Principles of Mass Persuasion.” <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12336576">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12336576</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>The evaluation studies demonstrated how difficult it was to induce mass behavioral changes. Effective programs of mass persuasion must 1) change the cognitive structures of individuals; 2) change the motivational structures of individuals; and 3) activate new forms of behavior. In order to promote cognitive change it is necessary to insure that the sense organs receive the media messages and that the messages are relatively compatible with the existing cognitive structures of the individuals receiving the messages. If the messages are too deviant, they will be rejected or distorted by the receiver. To promote individuals toward a specific action, the individuals must be convinced that the action, being induced, will lead to the fulfillment of personal goals; however, even motivated persons frequently fail to perform the actual behavioral patterns which is being promoted. Individuals must also be provided with a specific path of action and a specific time for action. Only if all 3 of these processual changes are induced will a program of mass persuasion effectively accomplish its goal.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In basic terms it is #1, make a person emotional #2 provide them a solution #3 prove them a path to obtain that solution. Unless, of course, you just want people to do nothing, at which point, if you are the news, you just make people emotional and don’t offer any solution.</p>

<p>The Great Scam is using these psychological tricks to keep people from acting or to get them to act, depending on what is needed to grant a policy change. Nearly always, that is the goal. To sell you policy change or maintain the policy status quo. While this originated, more or less, with the Tavistock Institute of Human Relations, the Brookings Institute in the US and the Lowry Institute in Australia are the overseas facsimiles, but there is a vast network of NGO’s under these umbrellas that are all operating under the same premise with common goals.</p>

<p>By creating news on the ground, using the news outlets to spin it to the people, policy is effected. Hurst is the obvious early example. 1898. The trappings have become more sophisticated, but the core concept hasn’t changed much since Freud’s Wednesday Psychological Society.</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Propaganda_of_the_Spanish%E2%80%93American_War">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Propaganda_of_the_Spanish%E2%80%93American_War</a></p>

<p>One of the smartest people I know appeared to be devastated by Trump’s victory and when I asked, “But what about the Uranium One scandal?” She had no idea what I was talking about, referring to it as a “conspiracy theory” and said I was only watching “partisan” news sources. Neither of those things are true. The Uranium One scandal does reveal a conspiracy, though, and the world at large seems to be slowly coming around to understanding it.</p>

<p>Here is the New York Times article, “Cash Flowed to the Clinton Foundation Amid Uranium Deal.”</p>

<p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/24/us/cash-flowed-to-clinton-foundation-as-russians-pressed-for-control-of-uranium-company.html">https://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/24/us/cash-flowed-to-clinton-foundation-as-russians-pressed-for-control-of-uranium-company.html</a></p>

<p>The very pro-Hillary Huffington Post even admitted it, last week; “Yes, Cash Flowed to Clinton Foundation Amid U.S. Russian Uranium Deal”</p>

<p><a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/yes-cash-flowed-to-clinton-foundation-amid-us-russian_us_58aa5dd6e4b0fa149f9ac82f">http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/yes-cash-flowed-to-clinton-foundation-amid-us-russian_us_58aa5dd6e4b0fa149f9ac82f</a></p>

<p>The Uranium One story is interesting for a number of reasons because, even while they are admitting it happened, the extent of the problem is never even alluded to. The way these stories are covered is very intentional and I can demonstrate that with primary sources. The Uranium One scandal is the tip of the iceberg that the media is trying to hide while the evidence continues to pile up and garner attention.</p>

<p>Pseudonmyously, I have made very detailed articles explaining the whole Uranium One problem and I am beginning to feel fairly vindicated as the Huffington Post is even having a hard time spinning the story. Because of my previous efforts, I’m not going to hyper focus on the issue, as the truth you uncover from the scandal is the scary part.</p>

<p>To sum up, the relevant primary sources are Podesta’s own documents, after he was already caught committing treason. Treason being, “engaging in political activity while under the control of a foreign power,” per US law.</p>

<p>Let’s look at a picture of how money comes out of the Kremlin’s Sberbank, into offshore accounts and into the hands of our politicians. This image is from the Panama Papers search.</p>

<p><a href="http://i.imgur.com/TZrYgtb.png">http://i.imgur.com/TZrYgtb.png</a></p>

<p>Sberbank funds RAS Corporate Services which funds Troika Dialog. (Troika is the term used to describe the EU version of the Trilateral Commission)</p>

<p>In this document, the Podestas admit that they are under the control of a foreign entity, Troika Dialog and Sberbank, and the reason this form was submitted was only because of the Panama Paper leaks. Otherwise, this never would have been reported.</p>

<p><a href="http://archive.is/SoaOa">http://archive.is/SoaOa</a></p>

<p>It gets worse, though. Still, as of yet unreported, are the 100,000 shares of a Russian company, Joule, going to Podesta’s daughter’s shell company, Leonidas LLC. Meanwhile, the Clinton Foundation was accepting $145 million dollars surrounding the deal. Everybody was getting paid and getting shares of Uranium One, then hiding the shares in other shell “energy companies.”</p>

<p><a href="https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/4635">https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/4635</a></p>

<p>Long story short, the CEO of Kazatomprom was thrown in jail over the whole thing while the CEO of Rosatom and Sberbank used clever ways to pay off our politicians and lobbying firms. The ways they paid them aren’t novel. There is a system in place specifically designed to funnel money to our political machine while the media works very hard to cover it up.</p>

<p>There is no separation between our news sources and our political machine.</p>

<p>In Podesta’s own filing, you can see how this machine works:</p>

<p><a href="http://imgur.com/sxMFlAG">http://imgur.com/sxMFlAG</a></p>

<p>Every news outlet is taking orders from Podesta. We see it in his emails and in his emails we know there are many other channels of communication. We repeatedly see conversations end with “not for this channel.”</p>

<p>Completely separate from that list is the list revealed from the Wikileaks emails.</p>

<p><a href="http://i.imgur.com/TcusKCM.jpg">http://i.imgur.com/TcusKCM.jpg</a></p>

<p>These two images are still just the tip of the iceberg.</p>

<p>So, while Uranium One is important because it ties the Clinton Foundation, NGO’s and human trafficking together, it is more scary because it reveals how the news is entirely based on the idea of deception according to a very specific formula. Meanwhile, other deals are being made about oil.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.cnbc.com/2016/12/11/qatar-glencore-to-buy-195-percent-stake-in-russia-state-oil-major-rosneft.htm">http://www.cnbc.com/2016/12/11/qatar-glencore-to-buy-195-percent-stake-in-russia-state-oil-major-rosneft.htm</a></p>

<p>These are the same people, involved in the Clinton Foundation, trading guns and resources, including slaves, because that is who works in the mines. Just read the State Department’s own reports on human trafficking.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.state.gov/j/tip/rls/tiprpt/countries/2015/243465.htm">https://www.state.gov/j/tip/rls/tiprpt/countries/2015/243465.htm</a></p>

<p><a href="https://www.dol.gov/agencies/ilab/resources/reports/child-labor/kazakhstan">https://www.dol.gov/agencies/ilab/resources/reports/child-labor/kazakhstan</a></p>

<p>If you’ll remember, Marc Rich was the controversial last minute pardon by Bill Clinton that is still under stalled investigation. Marc Rich is the CEO of Glencore, which has been implicated in human trafficking. Frank Giustra’s mining operations also require forced labor and he is the one who set up the Uranium One deal. (Clinton fired almost the entire DoJ upon arrival and those people are only now leaving with Trump’s entrance.)</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Clinton_pardon_controversy">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Clinton_pardon_controversy</a></p>

<p>This is all just an extension of the American Security Council Foundation’s work, also run by miners, and who used Ronald Reagan as their front man.</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Security_Council_Foundation">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Security_Council_Foundation</a></p>

<p>The Clinton Foundation and the American Security Council Foundation are exactly the same animal. They are CIA fronts that use legal immunity to facilitate corruption that gets resources out of the ground as cheaply as possible.</p>

<p><a href="https://knowthechain.org/the-nexus-of-illegal-gold-mining-and-human-trafficking-in-company-supply-chains/">https://knowthechain.org/the-nexus-of-illegal-gold-mining-and-human-trafficking-in-company-supply-chains/</a></p>

<p>Not only that, they sell legal immunity for donations to their foundations because they have the political clout and the control over the Department of Justice to stymie any investigation within the US and forensically sabotage any case that ends up in another country. Prosecutorial immunity is for sale by the deep state and it has been for a long time.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-4197734/Drug-dealer-jail-Obama-pardoned-him.html">http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-4197734/Drug-dealer-jail-Obama-pardoned-him.html</a></p>

<p>It’s an interesting problem that most people can get behind to some extent; use our intelligence apparatus to ensure economic security for Americans. Where do we draw the line, though? Slavery? Murder? Allowing slavers and murderers to roam free? Even if you can get on board with that, it turns out that a blind eye to slavery and murder takes a really, really dark turn.</p>

<p>The idea to use the illegal drug trade to control the population gained the greatest force after Aldous Huxley participated in the Opium War. Huxley’s premise was that society could be controlled through mind altering drugs to make “happy slaves.” Lyndon Larourche called Huxley “the high priest for Britain’s opium war.” </p>

<p>Not only can you make the population passive, you can drive up the price by making it illegal. The CIA has turned this into an art.</p>

<p>They donated a plane to the Sinaloa Cartel that crashed with 3 tons of cocaine. This has happened many times.</p>

<p>Gary Webb wrote the Dark Alliance series that detailed the relationships between the CIA and the creation of the crack epidemic in urban areas. We are supposed to believe that Gary Webb committed suicide with two gunshots to the back of the head.</p>

<p>Our special forces soldiers are being tricked into thinking that this is a just and fair fight, when all we are doing is locking up the profits from the illicit drug trade as both the legal and illegal drugs are used to pacify our entire country.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the news is working to make sure that anyone who points out the obvious is branded as “unpatriotic” or as a “conspiracy theorist.”</p>

<p>While I absolutely like to read about conspiracy theories, I was a little insulted by my friend who attempted to paint my explanation of the Uranium One scandal as a conspiracy theory before even knowing anything about it.</p>

<p>That is the trick, though. The term &quot;Conspiracy Theory&quot; from CIA Document 1035-960 and was created to undermine and ridicule critical thinkers. Here are the “CIA Instructions to Media Assets”</p>

<p><a href="http://www.realhistoryarchives.com/collections/assassinations/jfk/cia-inst.htm">http://www.realhistoryarchives.com/collections/assassinations/jfk/cia-inst.htm</a></p>

<p>In order to hide the CIA assassination of JFK, they created a cognitive framework whereby you are socially rewarded or punished, based on what you told people about the JFK murder.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, they are casually referring to CIA murders in diplomatic cables.</p>

<p>The intelligence community doesn’t care about murder. It’s not their job:</p>

<p>Of course, you may recall, Hillary Clinton’s fingerprints were found on Vince Foster’s documents.</p>

<p>The scariest goal of the CIA and friends is that of “mind control.” Operation Paperclip was the effort to secure Nazi scientists who had already been participating in unethical human experimentation.</p>

<p>The Tavistock Institute of Human Relations had pioneered research into trauma during World War I and when the two efforts came together at the end of World War II, Operation MK Ultra was born.</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Paperclip">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Paperclip</a></p>

<p>“At  the  same  time  that  many  theorists  were  trying  to  gain  a  deeper  understanding  of  group  behavior,  European  disharmony  grew  to  the  point  of  war  in 1914. The war became a laboratory of sorts for the psychological study of group behavior.  For  example,  military  leaders  in  Europe  started  to  identify  nervous disorders  or  psychological  ailments  among  their  troops.  They  used  the  term Shell-shock to describe these ailments regardless of symptoms. Prior to this, any instability  exhibited  by  a  soldier  was  classified  as  cowardice  or  malingering, which was often punishable by death. Later research revealed that “amongst the records of those men shot for cowardice there is clear evidence to suggest that a number  were  suffering  from  mental  health  problems”</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_MKUltra">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_MKUltra</a></p>

<p>“MKUltra used numerous methodologies to manipulate people&#39;s mental states and alter brain functions, including the surreptitious administration of drugs (especially LSD) and other chemicals, hypnosis, sensory deprivation, isolation, verbal and sexual abuse, as well as other forms of psychological torture.”</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unethical_human_experimentation_in_the_United_States">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unethical_human_experimentation_in_the_United_States</a></p>

<p>“Several significant operational techniques were developed in this theater, including extensive research into sexual blackmail, surveillance technology, and the possible use of mind-altering drugs in field operations.”</p>

<p>“Several of the children who Cameron experimented on were sexually abused, in at least one case by several men. One of the children was filmed numerous times performing sexual acts with high-ranking federal government officials, in a scheme set up by Cameron and other MKULTRA researchers, to blackmail the officials to ensure further funding for the experiments.”</p>

<p>The CIA began to perfect their application of “trauma induced mind control” based on the knowledge acquired from Project Monarch. This is another basic psychological concept being applied in the real world. Multiple Personality Disorder.</p>

<p>”The first programming starts in the infancy. From the birth on, it is intended to let the slave get emotionally bind to one adult person, thus gets lovefully treated by him. Once the infant reached the age of 2 years, the first fragmentation by trauma gets conducted.</p>

<p>For this, the victim gets tortured by the emotionally bounded person. The torture aims to trigger a natural protection mechanism of the brain: splitting the personality, or create dissociation, respectively. Hence the unbearable pain, visibly activated by the only beloved person, the victim is confronted by two contradicted realities, which support the result. Following lovefull treatment by the torturer tightens the amnesia.</p>

<p>Once split, the fragmentation get more and more easy to conduct. The pain gets &quot;dissociated&quot;, thus it stays unprocessed and the slave in not able to remember it. Therefore, recovering slaves can appear highly suicidal[9], hence the memory shreds need to get integrated.</p>

<p>Other popular torture methods for further programming are electro shocks and pricking. Modern methods and devices allow all kinds of so called &quot;white torture&quot;, which is mentally effective, but leaves to physical damage.</p>

<p>When a general human experiences a trauma, he usually will remember it for the rest of his life. Hence Monarch slaves are being tortured constantly, they can gain eidetic memory as a side effect. This is being actively used for Alpha slaves.”</p>

<p>Now, this is where it really starts to sound far fetched, but there is a specific reason for that. The False Memory Syndrome Foundation, founded by a man who was accused of repeatedly raping his daughter, spent a lot of money talking about “The Satanic Panic” as if it does not exist, at all, end of story. Except, they don’t have anything to really support their claim. In fact, the studies regarding the matter show the opposite.</p>

<p>According to a study of 2,709 members of the American Psychological Association; it was found that 30 percent had seen cases of ritual or religion- related abuse and 93% of the professionals believed that ritualized abuse occurred.</p>

<p>In 1992, a survey of the membership of the ISSTD, Nancy Perry concluded that 88% of 1185 mental health professionals reported belief in ritual abuse.</p>

<p>In 1996, police in Finland discovered a “massive computer library of child pornography that included pictures of torture, mutilation, and cannibalism.”</p>

<p>Recently, Jimmy Saville was reported by police to have had over 450 victims.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.express.co.uk/news/uk/370439/Jimmy-Savile-was-part-of-satanic-ring">http://www.express.co.uk/news/uk/370439/Jimmy-Savile-was-part-of-satanic-ring</a></p>

<p>Jerry Sandusky was also reported to have been part of a larger pedophile ring.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/national/archive/2012/09/former-child-prostitute-claims-jerry-sandusky-was-part-pedophile-sex-ring/322896/">http://www.theatlantic.com/national/archive/2012/09/former-child-prostitute-claims-jerry-sandusky-was-part-pedophile-sex-ring/322896/</a></p>

<p>More recently, the Washington Post and New York Times removed their article about the Norwegian political pedophilia that was occurring after they were tied to the Clinton Foundation. The evidence list, again, had torture and murder of children.</p>

<p>In Lehi, Utah, Hadfield was convicted of ritualistic abuse, though, do to wearing masks, most of the perpetrators could not be identified.</p>

<p>Studies that investigate how often children lie about abuse make the FMSF defense statistically impossible. The results of this study indicated that professionals reported a small percentage of cases as having been false. Between 1 and 2 percent.</p>

<p>All that exposition is the beginnings of Pizzagate, when James Alefantis was discovered to have satanic, pedophile pizza art all over his and his friends’ social media. Most of it has been scrubbed from the Internet, though there is a constant effort by people to keep reposting it.</p>

<p>“The contents of it are indescribably bizarre and the contexts of the posts and comment chains are weird. Alefantis does not have any children nor do his closest associates, but the photos seem to be a near constant assortment of different children of a variety of ages, intermingled between posts about gay bars, clubs, photos of common rape drugs, and piles of foreign currency. After it being trawled through for 24 hours it has been set to private. A large set of archived copies can be seen here in the next section. Similarly the instagram and twitter accounts of Comet Ping Pong are being edited selectively. The accounts of the people favoriting and commenting on these posts are equally bizarre in both content, context, and demeanor.”</p>

<p>Like the drugs and guns, the CIA seems to be trading in trauma induced mind controlled children. Rachel Chandler’s social media is a trail of broken children with soulless eyes. Rachel Chandler flew on the Lolita Express with Bill Clinton and her photography features naked children.</p>

<p>The scary part about this whole thing is that a mind control slave generally will not remember any early abuse nor will have any idea that they are a slave. Because of basic psychological mechanisms, they will unconsciously fight harder to prevent that truth from ever being known without consciously knowing about that truth.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Do you happen to know how Brian Podesta is related to Tony and John? I think he is definitely related, there is a picture of him with Bill Clinton in the late 90&#39;s early 2000s in this video: Brian Podesta is a Senior Analyst at NCMEC and has Top Secret Security Clearance. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zb1zJHweIto&amp;amp;app=desktop">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zb1zJHweIto&amp;amp;app=desktop</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>Great write up.  Came across it via Voat.  Do need to state the irony that Mark Twain is often quoted as saying &quot;It is easier to fool people than to convince them they’ve been fooled&quot;; however, there is no known source for that quote.  Perhaps it was a paraphrase of something he wrote, but it is not an actual quote that can be cited.  </p>
