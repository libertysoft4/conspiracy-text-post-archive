        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Well, here is a recent <a href="http://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2017/02/03/national/fukushima-radiation-level-highest-since-march-11/#.WLHY8Vf1GlN">report</a> from Japan.</p>

<p>They state that they have no idea where the 3 reactor cores are and they cannot check this due to the high radiation. They planned on checking the containment vessel of reactor one last week but the discovery of the giant hole in the grating below the pressure vessel has made them abandon/change plans. They are currently reading + or - 537 sieverts per hour with a 30% margin of error.</p>

<p>Let me ask you, how long can a molten reactor core sit on the containment vessel before it melts through?</p>

<p>The only way to stop this would be to use the ground water to cool the core, and again they have stated that the ground water has been leaking into the ocean at a rate of 300 tons per day since March 2011. This means hundreds of radionuclides have been leaking into the sea. We have no clue how some of these isotopes behave in the environment and they only usually test for a hand full of them, namely; iodine, cesium and strontium. Yet, there are 118 elements and each of these stable elements can have multiple radioactive ones. For example, radioactive hydrogen is called tritium.</p>

<p>My point is, our food chain will definitely be contaminated. If Bio accumulation is true this is devastating, eating an ionizing radioactive isotope is potentially deadly, especially plutonium. </p>

<p>What bothers me the most is after Chernobyl they did not allow the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2009/dec/29/sheep-farmers-chernobyl-meat-restricted">sales and consumption</a> of many livestocks that were raised in nearby areas due to contamination and they have been rigorously testing their food since then.</p>

<p>What has been done about this disaster which is at least 3 times as polluting? I will tell you, they stopped publishing the tests or they stopped testing food/seafood all together....</p>

<p>I appreciate any discussion, as this is a topic that I care about and have done quite a bit of research to better understand. Mainly, due to the media not doing their jobs in this matter. If you would like to check some of this research, I documented it <a href="https://bioritize.wordpress.com/nuclear-debate-and-research/">here</a> in 2011. Much of which has been removed from the web, I wish I have known this years ago and taken some screen shots.</p>

<p>Your Statement is inaccurate, the World Media is reporting daily about Fukushima Daiichi, every Day i get more than 50 Articles from the leading Newspapers!</p>

<p>This is much more than about the true Problems of our World (Hunger, War, Displacement, Repression, etc.)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It doesn&#39;t really work that way on the microscopic scale.  The random jostling and thermal motion of the atoms and molecules in the ocean exerts far more energy on a given particle than the force of gravity.</p>

<p>So over a massive timescale, there will be some settling of the heavier elements, but for our timescale, you can assume the elements will eventually be evenly distributed throughout the entire ocean. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The food chain is already contaminated. For example rice from the Fukushima area has too high radiation levels to be sold. The government is buying this rice for the rice reserve.  Then they mix it with clean rice to bring the radiation level down. The reserve rice will be released to the market a few years later as the need arises (shortage of rice, request from food companies) and as part of the regular inventory control. The consumers won&#39;t be able to tell it is rice from Fukushima, or the products (rice crackers, miso, shochu, etc.) is made with rice from Fukushima.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Clicks and counts are the same.  The click is the sound the meter makes when it detects radiation.  </p>

<p>The mwn who developed the atomic bomb went nuts when they learned that the world had become contaminated to 20 CPM by atomic bomb testing.  They went public in the late 1950&#39;s saying if we ever get to over 50 CPM and stay there it will end life on Earth.  They knew their stuff and refused to back down.  That&#39;s why the test ban treaty was signed in the early 1960&#39;s.  I saw the program where they laid out the problem of too much radiation, I don&#39;t think there is any footage saved from that program.  </p>

<p>A constant exposure of 50 CPM will cause most people to become sterile before they can reproduce.  That&#39;s why it is a problem.  Continued exposure at that rate will bring on many health problems and the average life expectancy will drop to less than 60 years.     </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Think about one of those 3rd grade science experiments, where you drop a tiny bit of dye into a large tank of water, and you watch a physical reaction take place, the dye makes a really cool colorful swirl as it spreads, and eventually the entire tank of water shares parts per million of the dye. It&#39;s easier to think in smaller numbers because our brains really don&#39;t process 000,000,000 well. Big is just big. Yet we do have a finite water system. Eventually anything we as occupants of the great planet Earth put into the ecosystem spreads around to every corner of the space provided, just like the dye did in 3rd grade. If you have a tiny droplet, it&#39;s really difficult to see the dye once it spreads out to the space provided, but if you added a bucket of dye, then you could see the parts per million effect on the tank. This nuclear disaster adds giant amounts of radiation to the ecosystem every moment of every day for so long into our future, they cannot even measure it, and if it were red dye and it was back to the tank of water, it would look like cherry kool-aid now. And if they cannot figure out a miraculous answer to the problem, the dye will continue to be added to the water, and eventually it will look so dark, it looks like blood.</p>

Upon research, thanks to you level-headed question.  It makes no sense.  Non-ionzing is energy that cannot damage an atom&#39;s atomic structure , like radio waves and a majority of energy we receive from the sun.  Ionizing is high energy waves that can dislodge electrons and protons from atoms.  But my statement makes no sense.  So I fuckin take that back, sorry about that. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Except that&#39;s not how contamination works at all, in a situation where the source of contamination being poured into the ecosystem has no shut off valve. The water DOES shield the radiation when it&#39;s at that tiny droplet in a tank of water ratio, however, when it&#39;s a giant bucket, or a deluge, that goes on for hundreds of thousands of years with no containment, the water has less ability to dilute, and less ability to shield the ecosystem from irreversible damage. I believe that the reason we&#39;re learning about this on a global media &#39;we might as well tell them&#39; level is that the rods have melted past any control plan they&#39;ve attempted, past the concrete options, past the ice options, past the clever scientists trying like hell to figure this out options, and nothing can be done, and there is no way to hide it from the world.</p>

<p>The contamination is finite. It&#39;s limited. It can only leak for so long before all of fuel is gone.</p>

<p>The &quot;rods&quot; you are talking about aren&#39;t fuel. They control the nuclear reaction by absorbing neutrons.</p>

<p>No one is trying to hide it from the world. It&#39;s kind of hard to hide a melted down nuclear reactor. Three even. I just wanted people to understand how their lack of understanding makes it look a lot worse than it is.</p>

<p>As for how long until the radiation is <strong>gone</strong>, well, that will be several hundreds of thousands of years. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>A four-year international survey assessing radiological pollution of the marine environment near the plant commenced in July 2011, under IAEA auspices and led by Australia, South Korea and Indonesia. In September 2011, researchers at the Japan Atomic Energy Agency, Kyoto University and other institutes estimated that about 15 PBq of radioactivity (I-131 and Cs-137) had been released into the sea from late March through April, including substantial airborne fallout. In August 2013 Tepco estimated that 20 to 40 TBq of tritium might have leaked into the sea over 28 months since May 2011, which it compared with 22 TBq/yr discharge limit from the six-unit plant normally. The nine-month estimated releases from December 2012 for Sr-90 and Cs-137 were 0.7 and 1.0 TBq respectively, compared with 0.22 TBq/yr combined discharge limit. This is going into the 30 hectare inner harbour area, which is barricaded from the open sea. The radioactive contamination in the sea adjacent to the plant has remained much the same since early 2012, however, at harmless levels. Beyond the barricaded inner harbour, sampling out to 15km has indicated no detectable contamination since December 2011. (In 2013, Cs-134 levels of 0.9 Bq/m3 from Fukushima – 8000 times less than drinking water standards – were detected offshore Vancouver, enabling helpful study of ocean currents.)

<p>As to your question about Cesium, it would depend on the isotope of Cesium you are referring to. Isotopes of Cesium have varying half lives, ranging anywhere from a few years, to over 30 years. </p>

<p>Again, I am not saying that these conditions are favorable. I&#39;m just arguing that the media has taken the story and sensationalized it to sell more. </p>

<p>Compare how many people die each year from all the different forms of energy production, and you will see that in fact, nuclear power is one of the safest and most reliable forms of energy production on the planet.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree with you this has either been disregarded or total sensationalized. There seems very little middle ground.  There also seems to be a lack of testing coming from the US, in fact from what I can tell a total reduction in testing compared to pre-2011.  </p>

<p>10 atoms of Cesium-137 lets say.  50% of that will become barium-137 in 30 years.  50% of the remaining will take another 30 years to become barium-137 and so on for what some say is about 10x the half life.  So in 300 years most of the Cesium will degrade to barium-137m.</p>

<p>The barium is short lived but very radioactive, it actually has a half-life of 150 seconds and thus is a very high gamma emitter.  So in 1500 seconds the barium-137m has degrades into barium 137.  Which I believe is still radioactive.   </p>

<p>I guess my point here is that these isotopes don&#39;t just disappear they slowly break down and right now our only tests are for a few select types of these isotopes.  </p>

<p>You stating that his statement is false due to the fact that it is fear mongering is also false. Due to it being a logical fallacy.  </p>

<p>The cesium levels referenced in the video are astonishingly low. As <a href="http://www.sciencealert.com/highest-but-stilll-safe-levels-of-fukushima-radiation-to-date-detected-off-the-us-west-coast">this article</a> points out, about 500 times lower than the legal limit (not enough to do really anything).  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I am glad you have a healthy level of skepticism and this is likely why none of us really ever agree on anything.   I want to admit that I really have no clue wtf is going on here and I posted this thread to try and find more truth.</p>

<p>You are incorrect in your statement 537 sieverts per hour will not kill a person instantly.  That is like stepping into a microwave.  Anything over 4 sieverts has the ability to kill someone from a single dose.  Please look this up and don&#39;t trust me.</p>

<p>My entire point here is that this tripple meltdown is a huge disaster and an ongoing one.  It is leaking massive ammounts into the pacific and will continue to do so for decades.  We know very little about nuclear waste and its effects on life.  I have posted a few sources for the mutagenic effects of low dose radiation to living beings and it is quite alarming.  If you would like I can give you direct links.</p>

<p>This stuff bio accumulates through the food chain, so detecting a 2 bq/m2 rise in cesium-138 on the west coast in the water means that there is likely a larger amount in the seafood.  The fact that the US stopped testing or publishing the tests of the food in April of 2011 is also something to be concerned about.  </p>

<p>I am not claiming to have all the answers and I don&#39;t really trust any sources of media these days, fucking shame really that we cannot find creditable information. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;537 sieverts per hour will not kill a person instantly. &quot; Once again, no it will not. Radiation does not kill instantly. A dose of that over a couple of seconds would kill you, but it would take quite a while for you to painfully die.  </p>

<p>&quot;We know very little about nuclear waste and its effects on life.&quot; We know plenty.</p>

<p>&quot;so detecting a 2 bq/m2 rise in cesium-138 on the west coast&quot; The number mentioned comes from 2500 miles offshore. At the actual west coast is is likely even lower.</p>

<p>&quot;I am not claiming to have all the answers and I don&#39;t really trust any sources of media these days, fucking shame really that we cannot find creditable information.&quot; I have, one at least one occasion, linked you a scientific study on it&#39;s effect on seafood, and it the amounts found were not higher than is natural.

    <div class="md"><p>So I guess you are not really trying to find truth but sticking to your beliefs.  Let me show you just how wrong you are.</p>

<p>8 sieverts will kill you right away <a href="http://www.pbs.org/wnet/need-to-know/the-daily-need/how-much-radiation-is-too-much-a-handy-guide/8124/">source</a>.  So 537 kills every living thing in its path.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.ourradioactiveocean.org/">http://www.ourradioactiveocean.org/</a>  Are you refering to this data as being 2500 miles from the coast?  The 2016 results??  </p>

<p>The seafood is far from fine.  First of all they are only testing for cesium-134. But that isotope doesn&#39;t just dissapear once it decays, it is simply a smaller isotope.  Barium-135 and that shit will remain radioactive for 2.3 million years.  This stuff is toxic and emits ionizing radiation inside your body to all tissue surround these elements when you consume food.  This stuff bioaccumulates in living organisms and as this reactor will continue leaking for decades, our food supply is in serious trouble.  </p>

<p>They are only testing for two isotopes and &quot;they&quot; being barely funded organizations as our government has stopped its testing.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You clearly do not understand what I am saying about this radiation. A dose of a few seconds will kill you, but you don&#39;t die immediately. It takes longer to actually die. Louis Alexander Slotin during the whole &quot;demon core&quot; incident was exposed to WAY higher than 8 sieverts, and it took him 9 days to die.  </p>

<p>Also, that study I mentioned accounted for more than just cesium. Here is another article that talks about this, that still has doses very low: <a href="http://annualreviews.org/doi/full/10.1146/annurev-marine-010816-060733#_i18">http://annualreviews.org/doi/full/10.1146/annurev-marine-010816-060733#_i18</a>  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>OK so Louis Alexander was exposed to 21 sieverts, we are talking about 537, more than 21 to the 2nd power my man.  Not even in the same ballpark.  </p>

<p>So I cannot access the data to see if this is correct on the study of squids.  This test was done in 2014 and the explosions occurred in 2011, so they do not have a true baseline for their so called pre fuku levels.  Either way is it sad that we have to pay to read the scientific reports.  This group is also funded by the IAEA, so I take their &quot;science&quot; as such. </p>

<p>But I can tell you that the radiation levels at Fuku are increasing and they just found out the the entire core of reactor 2 is gone an 2 meter hole under the pressure vessel was found.  </p>

<p>I am telling you right now that if a child eats 1 bq of cesium according to the two reports I sent you.  They will have irreparable damage to their DNA and their likelyhood of having a normal child will decrease.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, I do recall you saying that &quot;8 sieverts will kill you right away&quot;, so... I mean, the dude literally held an actively fissioning nuclear bomb core in his bare hand.   </p>

<p>&quot;But I can tell you that the radiation levels at Fuku are increasing&quot; One of the things you linked earlier said that the only reason why the levels were increasing was because they were getting their equipment closer and closer to it. It wouldn&#39;t make any sense for the radiation to be increasing anyway. Radioactivity goes down with time, not up.  </p>

<p>&quot;I am telling you right now that if a child eats 1 bq of cesium according to the two reports I sent you.

<p>why in the world would you not just assume that the huge amounts of radiation going into the ocean are being sold to basically anyone who doesn&#39;t ask where their fish comes from?  (which is american restaurants in the midwest, among many other places)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, it was not the biggest nuclear meltdown in history. Chernobyl released about 7x as much radioactive material, and Fukishima is already in the livable state that Chernobyl is in, which had it&#39;s meltdown more than 20 years earlier.  </p>

<p>Also, the death toll from Fukishima at this point is 6 at MOST. Those 6 deaths (all workers) cannot even be directly tied to the meltdown at this point. No one has died from radiation poisoning either.   </p>

<p>The World Health Organisation (WHO) concluded that the most at risk group (infants), would experience (at most) a 1% increased cancer risk in their lifetimes. That certainly will kill at least a few of them, but in 100 years from now when everyone involved in the incident is dead, the death toll will still not come anywhere close to the estimate 4000 that will eventually die from Chernobyl.   </p>

<p>In addition, scans of the 160,000 people around the Chernobyl zone who were evacuated, only 30 people reached the max lifetime radiation exposure by a radiation worker (they were all workers). To give you an idea, there are plenty of Chernobyl workers alive to this die who exceeded that mount several times over.   </p>

<p>This is a line from an <a href="http://www.pnas.org/content/110/26/10670.short">actual scientific paper</a>: <em>&quot;Publication of this information resulted in a worldwide response that caused public anxiety and concern, although PBFT captured off California in August 2011 contained activity concentrations below those from naturally occurring radionuclides. To link the radioactivity to possible health impairments, we calculated doses, attributable to the Fukushima-derived and the naturally occurring radionuclides, to both the marine biota and human fish consumers. We showed that doses in all cases were dominated by the naturally occurring alpha-emitter.&quot;</em>  </p>

<p>I will tell that to the people mining Uranium, and I will tell that to the people of Chernobyl. Nice appeal to emotions.

    <div class="md"><p>Are you fucking stupid? Of course radiation kills you. I am not arguing against that. What matters is dosage, and all I am arguing is that the dosage put out by Fukishima is not nearly as bad as your are making it out to be.

<p>&quot;the estimates of only 56 deaths from Chernobyl are alarmingly low.&quot; That is the direct deaths. They also mention the 4000 number in that article. The 56 immediate death toll is actually accurate.  </p>

<p>&quot;I would refer to the first report from UNSCEAR which states more like 4,000&quot; That number is literally mention in the very link you just dismissed, and I mentioned it in my comment.   </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Of course it is safe (at least relatively speaking). Going by the very numbers that you offered, it is still the safest source of energy by a long shot.  </p>

<p>Dosage always matters. You are recieving radiation from all around your right now, from the food you eat, to the ground you stand on, to the very star that gives the planet life.  </p>

<p>Fear mongering by people like you and others is preventing nuclear energy from becoming the ideal energy source that it could be. Modern nuclear reactors are capable of running extremely cleanly, and have essentially 0 chance to meltdown. The molten salt reactor, for example, is a nuclear reactor design developed in the 60s that is essentially impossible to melt down, even if it is completely un-monitored and all safety systems are shut down.  </p>

<p>That is to not even mention nuclear fusion, and developing source of energy that is essentially perfect. Nuclear fusion runs on barely radioactive and abundant fuel, cannot melt down, generates massive amounts of power, and has no waste.</p>

&quot;what we have now is far less than safe.&quot; For the 50 billionth time, what we have right now is very safe.  </p>

<p>&quot; Chernobyl uninhabitable&quot; Nope. It is completely habitable. There are people living there right now, and as I already said, you could live your entire life literally a few hundred feet from the reactor and  it would minimally increase your chance to get cancer. Exact same thing with Fukishima.   </p>

<p>&quot; Bikini island uninhabitable&quot; Yeah, probably because they dropped 23 nukes on it without following standard procedure for reducing long term radioactive fallout. I don&#39;t know what that has to do with nuclear reactors.  </p>

<p>&quot; the mainstream hypothesis that nuclear power is safe.&quot; Ok you have got to be fucking kidding me on this. The mainstream idea is that nuclear energy is some kind of scary phantom that kills millions of people. The average person probably thinks that nuclear energy is the most dangerous energy source, and that incidents like Chernobyl have killed hundreds of thousands.

    <div class="md"><p>Well, it isn&#39;t a fossil fuel in the traditional sense. A fossil fuel is something that was formed through natural organic or geological processes. The Uranium on earth was formed 5 billion years ago when a massive star exploded.  </p>

<p>&quot; I would say that their kids have a high chance of genetic defects and their kids kids will also.&quot; What you say is not science. As I have already mentioned, the long term effects of living the a place like Chernobyl are relatively small. In fact, the radiation is basically an afterthought. The real dangers come from looters, wild animals, a lack of infrastructure, and the Ukrainian government trying to kick you out.  </p>

<p>&quot; Try eating a piece of radioactive material, which emits this shit inside you.&quot; This is actually interesting, because most radioactive material will kill you if you eat it not because of it&#39;s radioactivity, but because it is poisonous. If you ate something like yellow cake for example, the radiation would do relatively little while it passes through you, but it is toxic enough that that would kill you.</p>

You used are attempting to disregard my statements by using adhominem attacks.   Your second statement is somewhat confusing as this is exactly the problem we are dealing with.  Once a core melts down it has potential to release many more isotopes than just my super scary number of 118.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Nice, how much total radiation would be required to raise the radiation level by 2 bq/m3?   <a href="http://www.ourradioactiveocean.org/results.html">Source</a> for the radiation spike number as of 2016.  </p>

<p>So 1 km3 is = 1,000,000,000,000 or 1 trillion m3 which equals 2 trillion bequerals to raise one km3 of seawater by 2 bq/m3.</p>

<p>If I am still on target here, in order to see this kind of spike on the west coast, using your 34,000,000 km3 as an example you would need to produce, 34,000,000 x 2,000,000,000,000 bq of radiation.  That number is orders of magnitude lower than what they have said has come out of Fuku.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>From your source:</p>

<p>&quot;Our highest detection level to date came from a sample collected about 1,600 miles west of San Francisco that contained 11 Becquerels per cubic meter of cesium-137 and cesium-134. This means that in one cubic meter of seawater (about 264 gallons), 11 radioactive decay events per second can be attributed to cesium atoms of both isotopes. That is 50 percent higher than we’ve seen before, but even these levels are still more than 500 times lower than safety limits established by the US government for drinking water and well below limits of concern for direct exposure while swimming, boating, or other recreational activities.&quot;</p>

<p>I agree with you-this is a disaster. But-and it&#39;s a big but-it&#39;s not a disaster that is dangerous to people in the US. I haven&#39;t checked your math because I have shit to do right now-but I will. That said, a banana is 15 bq-which is about 1% of the daily background dose. This just isn&#39;t much radiation.</p>

<p>I used the average detected amount of cesium-137 from their 2016 data. Before the disaster there wasn&#39;t much cesium-137 to speak of, this molecule will degrade into barium-137 in about 30 years.  It would be nice if they had a table with the results.  </p>

<p>I will tell that to the people mining Uranium, and I will tell that to the people of Chernobyl. Nice appeal to emotions. The official estimate for the total death toll from Chernobyl after all of those exposed are dead is around 4000. That is about how many people die from air pollution in 5 hours.
