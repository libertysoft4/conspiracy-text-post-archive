</blockquote>

<p>Got some big words there little guy. Every genuinely intelligent American knows Hillary was deeply corrupt, so it does matter. Trump has proven to be anti-establishment, and pointing to his appointing a guy from Goldman and Sachs as proof he is a corporate stooge is a ridiculous attempt. Do you think every person that works at Goldman is pure evil? Is that what you&#39;re saying? Are you saying that every person that reaches the top of their respective industry is evil? Because that makes you seem really dumb. </p>

<p>If you have any useful information to offer besides dumb shit insinuations (as if we&#39;re a bunch of occupy wall st dumbasses mindlessly hating anyone who has had success in life) I&#39;m sure people would be open to hearing it. But your post sucks and from your name calling and dick sucking requests I&#39;m going to go ahead and make the conclusion that you suck too. </p>

<p>Tldr: sucks to suck</p>

<p>She&#39;s not &quot;done.&quot; There are <a href="http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2017/02/hillary-clinton-is-running-for-president-again-214766">credible rumors of her gearing up for a 2020 Presidential run</a>. And more importantly, using &quot;she&#39;s done&quot; minimizes her crimes and treason.</p>

<p>Hillary will be done when she&#39;s dead or in a jail cell.</p>
