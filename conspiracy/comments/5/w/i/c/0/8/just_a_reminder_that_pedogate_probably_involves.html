    <div class="md"><p>No. I think Jesus was a great man who was also a wonderful philosopher and preacher who had a great message. I don&#39;t think he was a deity, but history just mixed him up with a bunch of older religions/superstitions, and he became &quot;the son of God&quot;. </p>

<p>And I don&#39;t think that the hodgepodge &quot;God&quot; that Christians worship has much to do with Jesus the actual person. Or that the Catholic church as an organisation really gives much of a fuck about that stuff. I think they are a political organisation that is after power and uses religion as a tool to manipulate the masses. </p>

<p>I actually don&#39;t think there are any deities. Jesus was a good man,  but not a god IMO.</p>

<p>But I was just being a smart ass and using this thread&#39;s &quot;satan worshipers are controlling the world&quot; nonsense to springboard onto a point about Catholic priests raping kids. Because unlike PG, there is a whole mountain of evidence that <em>that</em> group of religious fanatics are supporting and trying to cover up pedophilia. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>very well said. IMO i disagree with everything about the spiritual conclusions you make about Christ (what about all the miracles and historical significance around his birth, death and life)?</p>

<p>BUT you are spot on and say it very clearly that the POLITICAL church, the men who are forced into celibacy, are suffering from an insanity and a self imposed mania, one tragic consequence of which is pedophilia. The concealment and protection of these monsters, no matter what &#39;religion&#39; they hide behind, must be destroyed.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;I am trying here to prevent anyone saying the really foolish thing that people often say about Him: I’m ready to accept Jesus as a great moral teacher, but I don’t accept his claim to be God. That is the one thing we must not say. A man who was merely a man and said the sort of things Jesus said would not be a great moral teacher. He would either be a lunatic — on the level with the man who says he is a poached egg — or else he would be the Devil of Hell. You must make your choice. Either this man was, and is, the Son of God, or else a madman or something worse. You can shut him up for a fool, you can spit at him and kill him as a demon or you can fall at his feet and call him Lord and God, but let us not come with any patronizing nonsense about his being a great human teacher. He has not left that open to us. He did not intend to.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>In one of Hillary&#39;s staffers e-mails, i think it was Neera Tanden, she offhandedly mentioned sacrificing a chicken to moloch in her back yard. Now, regardless of whether she was serious or not - Moloch isn&#39;t exactly a household name, and I can&#39;t imagine a work e-mail joking about sacrificing chickens to the god of child sacrifice to be the norm, or ever happen at all.</p>

<p>Further, there is other proof, but it is also circumstantial (Guccifer&#39;s claim that Hillary was a high priestess of a satanic cult, Abromavic, the weird Podesta shit).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There is this one passage from the bible which really struck me with how satanic the upper echelons of society are.  From Matthew 4:8-11:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Again, the devil took him to a very high mountain and showed him all the kingdoms of the world and their splendor. “All this I will give you,” he said, “if you will bow down and worship me.” Jesus said to him, “Away from me, Satan! For it is written: ‘Worship the Lord your God, and serve him only.’” Then the devil left him, and angels came and attended him.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It is clear from scripture that those who worship power must necessarily worship the devil.  Jesus calls the devil the lord of the world and for a very good reason, the world in a very real sense does belong to the devil.  Those who desire to acquire the world and all its treasure and to dominate others may do so but at the cost of their immortal soul.  However, this world is passing away and the only thing that will remain is the eternal Kingdom of God.</p>
