<li><p>&quot;Wikileaks&quot; founder Julian Assange was, by his own admission, &quot;on the run&quot; from an Australian CIA mind-control child-sex cult that his mother belonged to.  The group practiced torture, sexual abuse, hypnotism and pharmaceuticals to induce Dissociative Identity Disorder, with the goal of programming alternate personalities.  The children in the cult (which included Assange&#39;s mother, and may have included Assange) were given multiple identities, multiple names, and multiple passports:

    <div class="md"><p>I smoked for a dozen or so years, loved every cancer causing second of it but had to quit.   Went to a local hypnotist, talked to him for a few minutes explaining the procedure. Taken into a bedroom in his apartment, sat in a lounge chair, placed headphones over my head and listened to a TAPE recording of him saying &quot;You&#39;re getting sleepy&quot;..... This recording lasted about twenty minutes, him saying smoking is bad, you don&#39;t want to smoke any more... blah, blah, blah.... until the &quot;three, two, one.. awake&quot; finally happened.   At no point ever did i think I was &quot;under&quot; at no point in time did I think this was anything but a silly waste of money.  I paid the guy and left.  I didn&#39;t smoke another... I didn&#39;t even think about smoking another cigarette for almost 15 years.   10/10, would recommend. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>this type of reaction has more to do with the victim than with the procedure, there are people that are very prone to follow suggestions. there are studies that show that people neither have to be hypnotised to be influenced.</p>

<p>one time david coperfield was show a magic trick in tv, with part of a haunted house. i was 7 when i saw this, i could not sleep that night, i had fever and was delirious because i think that the ghost are in my house.
