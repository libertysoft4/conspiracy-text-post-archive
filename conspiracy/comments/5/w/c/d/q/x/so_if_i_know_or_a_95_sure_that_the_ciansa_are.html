        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>It&#39;s long ass long story, but the newest events are that they keep sending kids towards me when I walk the dog or go to the store, the kids act weird, trying to get people to look, or simply trying to purposely be in the way, so that these slime bags can take pics which could be taken the wrong way.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know what to do anymore. They even block my passport so I can&#39;t even leave the nation.</p>

<p>Today, for example, I&#39;m at the store, right? There are tons of lanes open, and some kid picks MY LANE to get into, wave his arms around like a maniac like I&#39;m supposed to look, but I didn&#39;t. That one might be just something that happened naturally, but the other week when TWICE some kids REFUSED to not stop trying to purposely get in the way of me and my 100lb dog no matter how many times I tried to cross the road away from them, and they looked like they were going to cry, like being forced into this sick shit. Maybe some sorta Podesta sick shit.</p>

<p>I told the FBI, right? Completely ignored me, twice.</p>

<p>Today I&#39;m driving around, and two different times, in two different parts of the city, miles apart, hours apart, this same lady, same truck was following me, talking into &quot;her hand), which I could see was holding one of those mics that go on your shirts, whatever those are called. I saw an old guy doing the same while eyeing me, but didn&#39;t bother to hide the mic while driving around me too.</p>

<p>It&#39;s been like 1.5 years and this weird ass shit is STILL going on but I have no idea why, or who can help, and why they are trapping me in the USA. I never sold secrets to the Russians or anything like that, so FUCK OFF.... sorry, but this is all so god damn frustrating. I can&#39;t even pay rent anymore as they destroyed my business. </p>

<p>If you can help, thanks. I&#39;m not a crazy guy, just don&#39;t understand WTF some group would do this, but have had a few people hint/tell me that it&#39;s the CIA. (WTF?!)</p>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong></p>

<p>A person requested that I put the events into short bits below. It&#39;s not a full list, but it&#39;s pretty good, and maybe it&#39;ll help? I dunno, but I hope so:</p>

<p>• Be me. Be 2015. Be “that guy”, kinda, sports car, tech firm, drugs (no making or selling, personal use only, nothing big), sex, EDM, so on, but not rich or anything, but kinda be “that guy” on accident. Be around NYC.</p>

<p>• Start noticing some pretty god damn weird shit going on at the home network, figure it’s the Chinese, the fucks. Nope, NSA servers.</p>

<p>• Notice my Windows 7 patches aren’t matching up in size. Something is fucked, but DLing them from MS servers, ask in some deep sys admin forums, guys are like, “looks like you got “their” interest”. Whoopsy.</p>

<p>• Start getting “terrorist” comments, loads of them. Like I’d make a comment on reddit, or for a few months when I use to go to Voat, and see tons of replies to like video game or car comments but trying to talk to me about terroristic kind of things, some things truly disturbing. I guess I should have reported them, but I just “noped” right out.</p>

<p>• So my wife finishes her post-doc, she’s pretty god damn good in her field too, like awards, all that shit, respected, awesome! I’m doing good, she’s doing good. Clean credit, clean cards, saving for the house, living the dream, but not super rich, but that’s okay yay…. So she goes to apply for jobs, and she applies to loads, and the only jobs she manages to snag are 3 offers in shitholes, the clear best being in Oklahoma City. So, well, we go there, despite it seeming as if the “obvious choice” was made for us.</p>

<p>• So I’m looking for a rental house, and this house comes up on the website, claims it was posted for two weeks, but I had never seen it days prior, but I click on it, and we get it.</p>

<p>• Move there. Edmond, Oklahoma, kind of the “upper class” er w/e, area of OKC. Place is fucking weird. Like 25 pharmacies for a small town, always busy. Wut? Everyday at 6:30 the streets are PACKED with cars, like clockwork, and each night at 9:30 the streets are empty. The place is a fucking ghost town. Creepy… but fun for driving around in the sports car, haha.</p>

<p>• First person I interact with in OK is someone saying that “You come from the land of the sinners.”, okaaaaaay. Other weird ass interactions, like I’m at the DMV getting the new plates or w/e, and a guy comes in, sits down, makes fun of my shirt twice, gets up and leaves. Wut. I bring my cat into the vet, and the vet holds the cat hostage, but the vet IS TERRIFIED of both me, basically pissing himself, as I can be a fairly scary person when it comes time (not bragging, just reality), and he’s scared of the situation. He’s between a rock and hard place about giving my cat back. Wut? Various other frankly bizarre things happen.</p>

<p>• About Oct-Nov 2015 Business starts to fall apart, all these things combined I get depressed and go get some blood work done and go see a psychologist Anita Walker, LPC out of Edmond, Oklahoma. I don’t just go see her, but am kind of bizarrely guided via different offices and phone calls into seeing her. </p>

<p>• I go to the office, and see the main psychiatrist in the office, the gentleman, an immigrant, would not look me in the eye, would only look at the ground, like a kid caught with the cookie jar kinda thing… WTF? Oookkkaaaay…. </p>

<p>• This fucking cunt of a woman does the works, meanwhile I’m not who I am now, at the time. I’m naive and unsuspecting of the evil all around me, mostly, though I had told my wife once, “It seems like there are enemies all around me here. It’s weird…”, it was just a “feeling”, heh. Anyway, this evil slime Anita Walker does it all, gas lighting, strawman and all this shit when I’m vulnerable to a psychologist trying to get help. Evil defined. </p>

<p>• The doctor says my blood work says my testosterone is low, tells me to use gel, and the maggot vomit Anita Walker made sure I was on “Prozac”… which I use in quotes as I’ve never heard of a mother fucker having full on, super detailed closed eye visuals on Prozac, so who knows, and my GP gives me more Adderall.</p>

<p>• So just to clarify, to be very clear to all reading this, people who you will soon read were associated with the CIA made sure that I was on testosterone (causes massive rage if overdosed), 2x Adderall (major energy and rage inducing), and a… “Prozac”… all at once, about the same two weeks. Prosac is known to make people kind of “unstablish” during the first two weeks, or it can sometimes. Soo, that’s an AWFULLY INTERESTING COMBO DON’T YOU THINK?! Say… if maybe you wanted to turn someone into a terrorist and kept doing weird things to them to hurt them and cause them psychological stress. HHHMMMMMM</p>

<p>• So, I do go a bit nutty here and there, luckily by my lonesome. I’m ashamed, but that wasn’t “me”, that was some chemical fueled monster.</p>

<p>• I stop taking the shit after I realize the evil that is Anita Walker was fucking with me the whole time, I think she was telling me about how her daughter likes some illegal porn, or protects it or some shit, something about Vegas and some other shit. Fuck her. Anyway….</p>

<p><strong>EDIT TWO</strong></p>

<p>• So this entire time these “click” devices are put into my rental… the rental that is owned by Air Force Intelligence officers….. yeaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhh….. uh uhuh. With the weird ass security system which main circuit board doesn’t power the other bits, some other board powers it which makes no sense in a normal houses…. Uh huh…. Anyway, the “click programming” begins. Two for “yes”, one for “no”. They put the devices everywhere, it’s all over. Powered by… things that maybe I shouldn’t even state because of national security? Do you see? I’m not against the US gov, or don’t want to be, but they want me to be. What the fuck?! Anyway. Just know that they have some rather interesting abilities beyond what is normally known to the public, and these “clicks” have been verified by others, my wife, pets, other people, sooo, yep, real, not me going insane. </p>

<p>• The clicks slowly start up, slowly work their way into things, like if something good happened, then “click click”, so my subconscious understands that “click” is no or bad and “click-click” is yes or good. Simple, and powerful with the most interesting ways they can use the technology. </p>

<p>• Do they use this technology for good? (somehow) No. No, instead they decide to continue to destroy a man’s life using these clickers and continue to do so this day. Isn’t that fun. 1984 is here, but it’s clicker training, hacked computers, and shitty super spies. I sometimes think that I’m a practice case for the incoming 1984’ish thing, the new SS, new Nazis, it sucks, but…. Yeah.</p>

<p>• ANYWAY! So there I am understanding that I’ve been tricked to take these drugs, the testosterone, the Adderall, the Prosac, and that I need to get help, so I kind sneak to a different doc and get different blood work done. </p>

<p>• Well wouldn’t you know it, yes you know it, reader, my testosterone levels were SUPER high, and wouldn’t you know that the mother fucking original dirty doctor calls me and tells me that my T levels are STILL super low and that I need to “double my dose”. Buahahahahaha. So I go over to his office in a wee bit of a huff, and put him in a situation involving metal and muscle and necks that issues the truth. “CIA, it’s the CIA.”. Well, what’ya know. There it is. I was shocked. CIA? Me? I’m just some guy. WTF?!</p>

<p>• It’s a weird feeling to learn that the CIA is after you. It’s surreal, a bad “B” movie, I often times call it. As I don’t know what the FUCK I could have done to those assholes to piss them off so bad, and if I had, why would they not just kill me off? I guess trying to make me into a terrorist with drugs, or something like that, was their plan? I don’t know.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT THREE</strong></p>

<p>• So I go back home and keep working away, and through a bunch a bullshit the clickers trick me into going to an airport, now I know how that sounds, but they did, it involved me asking them “yes” and “no” questions. So they got me to this airport, and through web traffic they’d sent me and stuff, they were trying to put it in my head that all of this was training to join the CIA, or something stupid like that, which is dumb, I kinda of only half believed it, but went along with it as they threatened my wife’s life. Yes, I know, you read all of that and you think that this man lost his marbles, but, no, it happened, I swear to you. There are sick people out there, these Podesta types, and they have their hands on some rather interesting tech indeed. </p>

<p>• So I’m at the airport and it was like I was supposed to go with the army troops that were there, but the kids seemed too young to be in the army, maybe not though. There was no room on the bus, odd. There was no room for me, okay, though it was suggested that there would be. So I figure I’m supposed to stay there or something, maybe the next flight in the morning which there was a ticket in MY NAME and my landlord’s name, weird huh? </p>

<p>• One of the new recruits, who seemed way too young to be in the army, imo, attempted to take my phone! And ran off.</p>

<p>• So I sleep in the airport, all the while my wife is crying at the house thinking I’m dead or something as I never came back home. These are the terrible things that these people do. She has cried so many times in the last year, and hardly ever 15 years before that. The amount of sorrow and hatred these people produce in this world, in us, and I’m sure others, shows that they should be removed from this planet. Anyway I’m in the airport and in the middle of the night a guy comes in and starts talking to me all spookily, and weird, though I didn’t catch most of what he said, but he was waiting for a morning plane like me. So I go outside, maybe I missed the pickup outside? I wait around, nope. I go back to the airport, that’s empty, and that guy is gone. The ACTOR who was going to fly out is nowhere to be found hours later. Huh.</p>

<p>• Eventually I get my ticket in the morning. It has my name on it, and my landlords name… wut… and I get in line at the airport, and I can sense all the creepy assholes around me, and they are having super loud conversations on their phones about “once you’re in line it’s too late to ever go back”, shit like that, and some girl is shaking her hair in front of me… like she has dandruff it was fucking crazy like a zoo. I get to the security guy, and he says “that’s not a legit ticket.” And then some lady SHOVES a little girl in front of me and another lady clicks a comically large pen, one big CLICK, at me. This is real, reader, this happened. WTF? What. The. Fuck? So I’m standing there like, wut? I look over and here is a guy who is dressed like a homeless man, but he’s not homeless (cleaned hands/nails), kind of staring at me, mouth agape, like a whole… scene. I look around. This is ridiculous. So this TSA agent comes by and in a false “motherly tone” tells me to have a seat and we’ll fix the ticket issue. I see additional “actors” kind of coming in, baby strollers looking creepily cheery, and I tap my fingers, and am like… okay… this is bullshit. This is a play, this is acting, as weird as this seems, and these people are dumb assholes.
• I’m like “fuck this”, and I get in a taxi, as I figured they’d put a bomb on my car or some shit, if this was supposed to be something bad? (Weird I know.) Sigh… god damn taxi driver is an actor too. I notice it before he even gets in the car. They have a stink about them. So we get to driving home and we’re shooting the shit, and then he mentioned my wife (I didn’t have my wedding ring on) DUN DUN DUUUUUN, but I don’t give him the pleasure, no I did not : ^ ) . See, I was supposed to go, “WHA?!?!!?!?!?!? HOW DID YOU KNOW ABOUT MY WIFE?!”, nope. I just keep going in conversation, and he slumped his shoulders. Mmm, yes… a small but meaningful victory for me. He then goes off about Life.Church and how I had better attend there service or else, when I get out of the cab, he’s like, “What are you going to do? Call the cops?”, and pretending like he’s reaching for a gun, bullshit, his fingers weren’t correct, he’s not armed. I’m thinking maybe this pen should end up in his neck, tell him something to that affect, which got him out of there quickly. </p>

<p>• I open the bedroom door to a wife that had been crying all night. The pain, sorrow, and hell that these people have created. Why?</p>

<p>Heh, no, I&#39;m sorry, that&#39;s not it. That&#39;s not where it stops, it&#39;s going to get worse here in a bit, keep reading, keep reading what the CIA/NSA has become and what they are doing to good Americans.</p>

<p>(Still writing a bunch of this up, TONS more to come...)</p>

<p>I&#39;m taking a break for a bit, playing some games, more to come.</p>

<p>(temp edit)</p>

<p>• So as you can imagine I was rather upset the abuse I had just received, and some things happened, but what ended up happening is me filling up our CR-V with the pets and we went to the in-laws house in Montana, We drove from OKC to the top of Montana straight, no sleep, as at the time I wasn’t sure if it was the CIA or a local mega church Life.Church cult trying to hurt us, but we were gone.</p>

<p>• They followed us.</p>

<p>• They were there in Montana for us. My mother in law gave us a house to use….</p>

<p>So it&#39;s morning now, and I don&#39;t feel like typing a whole lot, and to tell the rest of the tale would require just that. Know that these sick fucks suckered me into the mental ward of a hospital, and it was completely setup. I know that sounds like &quot;the crazy guy is talking about how he&#39;s not crazy&quot;, but I&#39;m not, it&#39;s real, verified by other people.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hell yea dmt is the shit! But I was talking 4-aco-dmt which is a totally different chemical. It&#39;s unscheduled at the moment so you can purchase it online no problem. 20mg is like an eighth of mushrooms. It&#39;s a way smoother come up and lasts the same as mushies. No nausea. Your brain coverts it into psilosin which is what psylicybin is converted into so it&#39;s basically the same thing except it&#39;s a chemical compared to natural mushrooms. Check it out. <a href="https://erowid.org/chemicals/4_acetoxy_dmt/4_acetoxy_dmt.shtml">https://erowid.org/chemicals/4_acetoxy_dmt/4_acetoxy_dmt.shtml</a></p>

<p>whoa there, you&#39;re starting at the end. can you give some insight on how the CIA/NSA have destroyed your life and why they are targeting you? I can&#39;t speculate on what&#39;s going on here if i don&#39;t know why they&#39;re doing it</p>

<p>Nope, it must be federal. </p>

<p>Someone out there told me something about &quot;brown stones&quot; the CIA does which is to try to get photos like what I suggested so that they can go around to local cops/churches/so on to discredit people. ... but why me?</p>

<p>Why the fuck would they use little mics instead of phones, lol? Maybe just to &quot;spook&quot; me?</p>

<p>BTW, a lot of this has been verified by my wife, of 16 years, who I might have to leave soon for safety. That sounds cowardly, but it&#39;s for her safety, and for me to MAYBE have a normal life again.</p>

<p>Maybe whistleblowing? I don&#39;t think so though. I&#39;d hang out in some places and put 2 and 2 together sometimes, and that&#39;s it.</p>

<p>Possibly framed, I had some servers that some israelis would rent from me. Maybe they were using them to funnel info or something, though doubtful. I&#39;ve shut them down a few months back in an attempt to &quot;fix&quot; what anything could be, but wouldn&#39;t the FBI had just told me, &quot;Hey, we need you to shut down those servers because of XYZ.&quot;? They&#39;re shut down now, though.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ok, well if that&#39;s the case I can assure you that nothing will happen to you. I still think you are imagining many of those things, BUT even if it&#39;s all real, what can/will they do? If you really did nothing wrong you don&#39;t have to fear anything. Posting conspiracies online won&#39;t get you into jail, they would have to put half of the population behind bars. The only thing what might be the case (again I think it&#39;s paranoia in your case, but let&#39;s pretend your story is 100 % true) is that they use you for some kind of training object or something like that, which would be totally harmless for you. My advice would be just relax and enjoy the show...and maybe try different therapists once in a while, just to be sure. :)</p>

<p>Haha, well that&#39;s a nice thought but for when they tried to kill me in that 120mph car chase, and when they tried to ice me with the testosterone overdose. It&#39;s probably going to end pretty badly, I am just hoping I can maybe leave the nation, and not have to see a really bad ending to all of this bullshit.</p>

<p>It&#39;s okay, you don&#39;t know the whole story, so you don&#39;t know how nasty they&#39;ll get when they&#39;re alone with me, but my idle time is up.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t like the thought of innocent people getting hurt, so I&#39;m careful, very cautious, and it&#39;s beginning to pay off, but, as I said, I&#39;d rather that this end nice and cleanly.</p>

<p>I&#39;m willing to even go and say 2/3 of my shit is fake, paranoia brought on by the first third (though I doubt this, think most is real), even then, that&#39;s TONS of instances of harassment, and destruction of my life. UN-FUCKING-WARRANTED!!!!!!!!!!!!!</p>

<p>Sorry, just drinking a  bit here, and blowing steam. It sucks.</p>

<p>Yes, I was thinking training as well, but a lot of this shit I think most of them would have fixed anyway, and why put their own agents lives in danger just for training? Foolish, but maybe these people are cannibalistic in nature, maybe they simply don&#39;t give a fuck about their own people, or those about to become their own people, this I can believe judging by past news stories about them.</p>

<p>I&#39;ll try to leave the nation, as painful as that is, and if I cannot, I guess we&#39;ll see what happens.</p>

<p>Yeah, gangstalking, or something like that, but the WHY would be nice to know. Can you imagine a group of assholes fucking with a guy for a year and a half? The cost in life-hours alone is staggering, even if it&#39;s an hour a day from a few.</p>

<p>No, that kid was fucking scared, like of the situation, and I TRIED VERY HARD to keep crossing the god damn road, three steps into the lane, and then she would cross towards us, until the very end I darted across the fucking road, lol. Someone forced that girl into a situation she was scared of, this is the type of sick minds we are dealing with here. Podesta types I think, something in that same evil mindset. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>No documentation can help prove your not crazy. I know you already we t to the doctors and they said your fine. So assuming you are fine and being stalked do you think the average person that can help you is ever going to belive it ... no you need proof and the less concrete it is the more you need. So say you see the same person in a 100 mile radius sure maybe that could happen once but if you proof that it&#39;s happening on regular basis you might have shot at geting some support. </p>

<p>It&#39;s difficult situation becuas most ppl will never belive and the ones that might atculy belive you might be scared to get involved. </p>

<p>Try to lay off the alcohol is know it helps relive the stress but so does meditation and getting centered. Try to find comfort in the fact that you are not alone there are others that claimed to experince the same thing.</p>

<p>And yeah start busting your ass documenting anything strange I know yer broke but there alot of low cost resources out there I would imagine. </p>

<p>Tell the kids in a fairly loud voice that you are worried that your dog might not like them. You want to avoid a confrontation so just don&#39;t get too close to you. </p>

<p>Any dog owner should be able to tell kids to keep a respectful distance away from their dog. Make it sound like you are worried about them and that you do not want them to provoke your dog into getting upset. </p>

<p>Maybe tell them the dog has some reason for feeling grumpy that day so they won&#39;t just assume you have a mean dog. A tooth ache? Bad prior history with children? Heart disease? Recent adoption? I&#39;m sure you can come up with a good reason. </p>

<p>If you start talking to these people you may find out you are totally overblowing this, which WILL make you feel a lot better about it. I have been through this so I know what it is like, their goal is probably to try to drive you crazy. </p>

<p>Why mentioned heart disease? That was an odd one.</p>

<p>The one that someone almost turned into paste wasn&#39;t thinking I was fucking around.</p>

<p>The one a few months back running away like a fucking noob, wouldn&#39;t say I was fucking around. I&#39;m no longer fucking around.</p>

<p>The time for giving them time to understand they got the wrong guy, or whatever, is gone, it&#39;s been too long, it&#39;s time to move forward. How much time were they given? A good long while, and they destroyed my life in the process. Interesting times to come.</p>

<p>Can you tell me a little about your tale, as that data may be helpful. Thank you, btw.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The way that we communicate reflects our internal state of mind. You say that you&#39;ve been evaluated for mental health, but in all honesty your communication here is a little vague and disjointed. You seem to have a tendency to jump to unrelated topics. No offense, stranger, but you sound paranoid. If a government agency was targeting you to trump up charges of pedophilia, you would know why. You don&#39;t. The reason you don&#39;t, is that no one is targeting you. This is actually good news.</p>

<p>The bad news is that you need a better therapist. Be careful with your alcohol consumption. Try to only work at easy jobs and avoid high pressure situations. You will be ok, but I honestly think you should look for another therapist. peace</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks.</p>

<p>Let&#39;s take the events of yesterday as an example, and these are just the kind of &quot;average weird&quot; events anymore in these days while I await my passport to arrive so I can leave this nation, and if it&#39;s blocked again, it&#39;s going to end badly for a lot of evil folks:</p>

<p>I wake up to my normal bad dreams.</p>

<p>See my wife of 16 years off to work, the one I can no longer trust as I&#39;ve caught her doing suspicious things several times... strange.</p>

<p>I get ready for the day while the little &quot;click&quot; sounds, verified by others, attempt to control/taunt/fuck with me.</p>

<p>I check my bank, broke as a joke as they&#39;ve destroyed my business spreading vicious rumor to all clients and so on. </p>

<p>I check my email, oh look, one of the assholes who I know is a part of it, is trying to rope me in on some money making scam project, no. The tiny balls on this fucker, who has no past, seems to be in with the CIA or the NSA, is trying to fuck with me again. When I met him and his buddies a few years back, is when all the weird shit started in my life.</p>

<p>At 11:30am est., I take my dog out for a walk to the store, it&#39;s about four or five normal blocks away.</p>

<p>There is an abnormal amount of traffic around my house for this time of day, foot and vehicle.</p>

<p>On the corner of my block is a woman with a baby stroller. Across the small road is a man cutting down a large tree. Now, I&#39;m not sure about you, but if someone were having massive limbs falling to the ground, I&#39;d keep my baby away from the tree more than 10 yards or so... she waves to some trucks passing by.</p>

<p>I keep my dog in the middle of the road, away from weird lady, and falling trees, and go to the next corner where I see cars full of people in brand new construction outfits, and three women on the opposite corner, in brand new construction outfits, all around middle age&#39;ish, all too pretty to be construction workers, and there isn&#39;t any major construction going on around us. These women have their phones out, laughing, having fun, taking photos or video of me.... okay... welp, just another god damn day in the twilight zone. If I hadn&#39;t had my dog with me, I would have ran over there and started stabbing. See, I&#39;ve reached a level of no fucks where I have more of a thirst for their deaths, than I do for answers to &quot;who and why&quot;.</p>

<p>I continue down the road, cars, well, mostly minivans with &quot;construction worker moms&quot; passing me, most have little symbols on the back of their cars, on bumper or window stickers.</p>

<p>While going to the store I saw two Hispanic girls running up and down the road. Shouldn&#39;t they be in school? Strange, or maybe not.</p>

<p>I get to the store, get some food and whatever, and proceed back home. There are now loads of those minivans with &quot;white christian soccer mom types&quot; wearing brand new construction vests driving all around me, smiling at me, most vehicles with various symbols on the back. </p>

<p>I get in an alley way and a Hispanic man and his little dog are walking. I get &quot;that feeling&quot;, this guy is here for me, this isn&#39;t an organic situation, so I pull out my knife to kill him. He books it.</p>

<p>I am now at the park, almost home, a van full of people, all looking at me, are pulling in, and a young man behind me, holding some type of hoverboard looking thing (are those real now?) is behind me. I reach for my weapon, just in case. They all back off. I get home.</p>

<p>Later I go out to get some medicine. I leave the house, same corner where those ladies were taking a pic of me, a white jeep is driving by, guy in a brand new construction outfit sees my truck and talks into his collar. I give chase. Pit maneuver, and either go in for the kill, or beat him until he answers questions, is the plan. Too many innocents around me. He books it, drives frantically., strange, why is he so nervous of seemingly me? I&#39;m just driving behind him casually. It&#39;s because he knows he&#39;s fucked. He takes a very strange and out of the way route to a Chinese food restaurant where he quickly gets out and runs inside. Getting into a public place, smart, or it would have been his ass.</p>

<p>I get back home, and the clicks start again, wife hears them too.</p>

<p>Welcome to a day in the horrible hell&#39;ish, life-destroying twilight zone I now call reality.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Being not able to get it up when needed is like an ongoing nightmare. But with the help of Cialis daily dose that nightmare is now gone for me. I am loving the full erections and mental peace Cialis has given me. I pop one tablet (10mg) in the morning and it keeps me impotence-free all day long. I can easily restore my energy and desire. I love how Cialis works. I order cheap cialis online without a prescription through reputable online  <a href="http://mytrusted-pills.com">http://mytrusted-pills.com</a> drugstore. There are so many online pharmacies that would sell cheap cialis, make sure you receive some good feedback before ordering, cause some places that would sell Ed drugs without pescription are not legit and will send you placebo or sugar pills. Good luck on your cialis experience.</p>

<p>I can assure you that nothing will happen to you.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Haha, well that&#39;s a nice thought but for when they tried to kill me in that 120mph car chase, and when they tried to ice me with the testosterone overdose. It&#39;s probably going to end pretty badly, I am just hoping I can maybe leave the nation, and not have to see a really bad ending to all of this bullshit.</p>

<p>It&#39;s okay, you don&#39;t know the whole story, so you don&#39;t know how nasty they&#39;ll get when they&#39;re alone with me, but my idle time is up.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t like the thought of innocent people getting hurt, so I&#39;m careful, very cautious, and it&#39;s beginning to pay off, but, as I said, I&#39;d rather that this end nice and cleanly.</p>

<p>I&#39;m willing to even go and say 2/3 of my shit is fake, paranoia brought on by the first third (though I doubt this, think most is real), even then, that&#39;s TONS of instances of harassment, and destruction of my life. UN-FUCKING-WARRANTED!!!!!!!!!!!!!</p>

<p>Sorry, just drinking a  bit here, and blowing steam. It sucks.</p>

<p>Yes, I was thinking training as well, but a lot of this shit I think most of them would have fixed anyway, and why put their own agents lives in danger just for training? Foolish, but maybe these people are cannibalistic in nature, maybe they simply don&#39;t give a fuck about their own people, or those about to become their own people, this I can believe judging by past news stories about them.</p>

<p>I&#39;ll try to leave the nation, as painful as that is, and if I cannot, I guess we&#39;ll see what happens.</p>
