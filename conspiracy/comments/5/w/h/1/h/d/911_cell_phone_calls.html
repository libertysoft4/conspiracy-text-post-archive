        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>So I recently was flying, and a few minutes after take off, still not even to the peak of my ascent, I realized I forgot to put my phone on airplane mode. I had no service. I&#39;m assuming on an iPhone 7, plus the cell tower progression over the last 16 years that service would be much more accessible now than in 2001. My question for anyone who knows about cell phones, cell service or flying is do you think it was actually possible for everyone on those flights to call their families before the crash?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It would have been impossible to use a cell phone back then, at cruising altitude. </p>

<p>It is nearly impossible to do so, even today. </p>

<p>The speed at which a commercial airplane flies, is too fast for the ground towers to complete their handoff protocols to maintain the call.</p>

<p>If you&#39;ve ever dropped a call while driving in a car, it&#39;s due to the towers usually not being able to complete the handoff between two towers. </p>

<p>Also, it&#39;s impossible for the towers to communicate with the cellphones beyond 8000-10000 feet. </p>

<p>No one&#39;s cell phone works at 30,000+ feet. I don&#39;t care who or what cell phone you have. </p>

<p>If you had a satellite phone... That&#39;s another story though! </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Over land. </p>

<p>Cellphone towers and their receivers are directional. The receivers / boosters / repeaters, are pointed over land, north, east, west or south.</p>

<p>They are not designed to serve the skies, and do not, to my knowledge, point their conduits into the sky. </p>

<p>You could not maintain or make a call at 30,000+ feet with 2001 cellular phone technology. </p>

<p>You&#39;d almost be winning the lottery being able to pick up a signal at 30,000+ feet in the air, let alone have it long enough to connect a call. </p>

<p>The next time you fly, I urge you to try it. </p>

<p>I&#39;ve flown plenty, and have been in telecommunications for over 10 years. </p>

<p>It wasn&#39;t possible then, and barely if at all possible now. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>In addition to cell towers being directional, and not pointing in the sky because of directionality, they also rely upon handoffs to switch service between towers. These handoffs don&#39;t work in airplanes, where the nautical mph airspeed and altitude makes for hundreds of mph landspeed. (That&#39;s why it only takes 2 hours to fly a thousand miles, and also why you can see many miles of distance from a plane.) Cell phone towers can&#39;t handle the switching fast enough to establish and maintain signal.</p>

<p>Cell phones don&#39;t work at cruising altitudes. You can verify this yourself on a flight sometime. </p>

<p>Or you can watch 9/11 A New Pearl Harbor and watch them prove it with three different phones from three different carriers. Above 5,000 feet, none of the phones worked. This experiment was done in the age of analog cell phone signal.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>yes, but i do not think it is claimed that these calls were made moments before the planes struck the buildings. they were no where near the towers when these calls supposedly happened. but yes once the plane was level with the towers, i believe calls would have gone through, but there were likely only seconds when the plane was within reach and when it impacted. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah just looked into it. I was partly right, just that it wasn&#39;t in the planes haha. But Blackberrys were not as reliant on the mobile networks due to their data system that held up pretty well. So they didn&#39;t experience all the bottle necking of the mega busy networks.
I do think this boosted their sales after the events though.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think yes, because the plane was getting lower and lower as it approached the city so it may have come into cell tower range. that said you&#39;re right that service was nowhere close to what we have now back then. is it easier for phone to connect to the tower when the plane is cruising (moving laterally) than when it is ascending/descending?</p>

<p>*Caller: “Mom? This is Mark Bingham.”</p>

<p>Caller: “I want you to know that I love you. I’m on a flight from Newark to San Francisco and there are three guys who have taken over the plane and they say they have a bomb.”</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I am old enough that I remember the news reporting on that day, and how they reported that the hijackers encouraged the passengers to call their loved ones to say goodbye, and there was a transcript from one woman describing getting closer and closer to the twin towers before flying into it. I assume they used the phones on the back of the seats if they couldn&#39;t have used their real phones. At the time I assumed they were encouraged to make phone calls so that they would be more subdued and not attempting to fight back as much.</p>

<p>Between the strength of the signal at 30,000+ft, location of the towers, the airplane&#39;s speed and being enclosed in a metal tube, you might get very, very spotty service but the chance is very slim. </p>

<p>I remember the Mythbusters did an episode on using cell phones when flying. The faa prohibited them from airing the episode. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was using cellphones during that time and flying a lot, in fact I flew to the states 3 years AFTER 9/11 and cellphones would stop working pretty much in airports and/or as soon as you say in the airplane. The reception was pretty awful then, not to mention your cellphone only worked if you were in your own soil. So the short answer is no. There is no way anyone could have made that call </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Over land. </p>

<p>Cellphone towers and their receivers are directional. The receivers / boosters / repeaters, are pointed over land, north, east, west or south.</p>

<p>They are not designed to serve the skies, and do not, to my knowledge, point their conduits into the sky. </p>

<p>You could not maintain or make a call at 30,000+ feet with 2001 cellular phone technology. </p>

<p>You&#39;d almost be winning the lottery being able to pick up a signal at 30,000+ feet in the air, let alone have it long enough to connect a call. </p>

<p>The next time you fly, I urge you to try it. </p>

<p>I&#39;ve flown plenty, and have been in telecommunications for over 10 years. </p>

<p>It wasn&#39;t possible then, and barely if at all possible now. </p>
