        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>As you know, iodine is a common additive to table salt. Iodated salt is a common supermarket shelf item that started mid last century. It, like fluoridation and &quot;fortified&quot; cereals, is an example of mass medication (for better or for worse). </p>

<p>Why then, is iodine so heavily touted in naturopathic and other alternative health circles as a wonder supplement? It is claimed to rid the body of excess fluoride. Why the f$#k then is our salt iodated? Why would TPTB mass medicate us with something that is actually beneficial? Fluoride goes without saying, but iodine?</p>

<p>It doesn&#39;t make sense. What do you believe? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This sounds plausible. Though I&#39;m not exactly sure how iodine would aid in counteracting fluorosis and fluoride-induced neurotoxicity (e.g. the mechanism of action), but know that potassium idiodie is one of the more common forms of potassium taken in supplement form, and possibly one of the more problematic when taken in excess. To avoid any potential complications, while still actively preventing any potential iodine deficiency or hypothoroidism, and for various other associated benefits, I opt for Kelp extract as an alternative. Kelp contains a natural form of iodine, along with beneficial (nutritionally relevant) trace minerals and antioxidants, and is generally better tolerated than potassium iodide (less likely to cause side effects), and cheaper as well.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This topic doesn&#39;t seem to be heating up much. Anyways, I noticed you before taking an unusual amount of interest in trying to &quot;debunk&quot; the 4chan alien pic fiasco. What gives?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Regarding the 4chan alien, I was here after the first prank happened, when people were sharing pieces.  They were the same pic but with different color hues.  I was viewing the action live.  Later, people started to draw or compile similar pics, I presume to get in on the trolling.</p>

<p>Later the original pics were declared fake by the group of people doing the trolling.  But there are so many people that are convinced about the newer fakes that it still lives on.</p>

<p>So I was pushing a link to the thread someone here wrote showing the evidence.  Now I instead push links to all the instances of the pics I&#39;ve found - as some people have said I sounded shilly.  I am no shill, I didn&#39;t want this alien pic to end up like Flat Earth fooling people.</p>

<p>-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=--</p>

<p>It is impressive how many people talk about this. I had an opinion on it and it was getting me a lot of negative flashback so I am bowing out to let those that believe in it fight over it.</p>

<p>To those that believe in this as a conspiracy, might I suggest to collect all the instances of the pictures, fake and real, and make a compilation? There are a lot of instances and styles.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It all seems very convoluted. Suspiciously convoluted. If the pic is indeed NOT a hoax, wouldn&#39;t it be the goal of someone to try and make it SEEM like a hoax? They would leave breadcrumbs here and there, leave suggestions here and there and play users off against each other. Thereby creating the illusion that the alien fiasco was nothing but a hoax with some trolls thrown in. </p>

<p>The initial reports of the thing (the first time it was reported and then taken down off 4chan) described the alien differently than any of the current pics show. People also said when they looked at the pic they experienced dizziness and vomiting. Now I&#39;m a little sceptical that this could happen through a computer medium, but the world is a strange place and we are but ants. But supposing that there was a genuine alien pic, the ensuing chaos over the last few days has certainly convinced most (including you) that it never existed. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>yeah, sounded like it was a group of people working together on discord to cause drama - and for a group of 20 to make so many ripples, it shows how easy we are to manipulate.</p>

<p>It is why I did what I was doing, copy/pasting the dispel link to try to minimize the damage.</p>

<p>Teh guys were good.  With the dizziness and vomiting talk, it really got people curious and talking, including me.  Then when I started to see the blatant fakes - a few of us knew something was up.  Then worse fakes but as mods were deleting this BS, that got people talking about conspiracies even harder.</p>

<p>It was well done or it was just lucky happenstance, I am unsure.  But my actions of trying to slow down the alien disease just seemed to buy me bad press which is a bummer.</p>

<p>What makes you think people would want that? Why do you feel as if you should try to put matters into your own hand and push your private agenda? I&#39;m not accusing you I&#39;m just curious. </p>

<p>That&#39;s what I meant. IF there was a real alien pic, the influx of blatant fakes would subconsciously cause people to disbelieve and move on. If there is a cover up, that is why there is drama. </p>

<p>I am quite sure it is Wayne. He mentions it on camera just moments before a reporter says the word &quot;tent&quot; which triggers some kind of response in him. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Why would I take on the agenda of stopping the alien spread?  Because my nature is to stop fake news.  It is the same when I see instances of Flat Earth threads.  Any flat earth thread I whack-a-mole, and any alien-pic thread I did the same.  And really, all I did was inject truth into each one.  If someone refused to believe the link I posted, they could continue to believe.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well this sub has no use for those kinds of &quot;natures&quot; and people playing God. Some of these things you&#39;re dismissing as fake could very well be true. </p>

<p>No I don&#39;t know anything about the multicolored pic. All I&#39;m saying, if the first narrative is true (4chan being taken down, the pic being erased from peoples hard drives) then there is no real alien pic to see, since someone or something doesn&#39;t want it to be out there. Their next course of action would be to alter the narrative and turn the tables on those people and make them look like trolls. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>those things I feel are fake could very well be true - you are 100% correct.  So the way I pointed people to info I felt is true, someone with a higher truth could have replied and told me they had truth that proved me wrong.  That is how peer reviewing works.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t play god.  If anything, I play librarian.  I find others that feel similarly.  We find truth and try to prove each other wrong.  That is what this sub is about.</p>

<p>As for you not being familiar with the multi colored versions of the alien, that would lead me to believe you were not here for v1 of the alien.  It makes sense that you feel my links would be wrong.  See my link that someone made up titled ayy lmao something something - and you&#39;ll see the people that trolled explaining it including what background files they used.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Pick up a canister of table salt at the supermarket and read the ingredient list. It&#39;s not just salt and iodine in it. They add anti-caking agents and dextrose (derived from GMO corn), too. These ingredients add no nutritional value. There&#39;s no reason to be eating this unnecessary garbage when you can buy a pound of iodine-free sea salt from Trader Joe&#39;s for less than $2.00.</p>

<p>The iodine supplements touted by alternative medicine are typically derived from kelp, which is a potent natural source of iodine. It&#39;s not the same thing as the chemical GMO cocktail added to table salt.</p>

<p>The official narrative for why they add iodine to salt is because it prevents goiters. It made sense at the time to do this in Third World countries and food insecure areas where starving people are unable to naturally get the daily recommended amount of iodine in their diet. Why they continue to do this in developed countries where fresh food is plentiful is suspicious.</p>

This doctor David Brownstein says many people are deficient in iodine and only 10% of iodine in salt is bio available. He goes into the history of iodine and describes the relationship to bromine and fluoride. </p>
