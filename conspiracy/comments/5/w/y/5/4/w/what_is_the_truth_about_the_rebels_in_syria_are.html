    <div class="md"><p>Adding to your post, the US is bombing ISIS territory to push their forces further west. There&#39;s a reason why the US has let ISIS survive and even aid them sometimes. They (US) wants Assad out more than anything so they use ISIS to push on Assads eastern front while the &quot;rebels&quot; push on the western front. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, they&#39;re basically all ISIS. And we knew this the whole time.</p>

<p>US knew that the rebels included Al Qaeda in Iraq, which became ISIS. And funded them:</p>

<p>Amnesty International report shows ISIS had US weapons</p>

<p>General Mike Flynn states that the US is knowingly funding ISIS (this is the real reason he was forced out of Trump&#39;s team)</p>

<p>ISIS leader admits he is funded by the US</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, I agree with you about Flynn...but he was a lightening Rod as long as he was in a public position.  I believe that he is still working his magic behind the scenes (along with his entire staff that left with him).  Personally, I hope that Russia has no real &quot;ill will&quot; for the US and that we begin to cut the funding of all Globalists organizations working in American (via IRS, FBI, DOJ etc...) and kick them all out of our country like Russia did (and like what Hungary is doing now).  I am on the fence about how Israel is involved in all this....I&#39;ve heard some pretty terrible things.</p>
