        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>from u/Everclearsky</p>

<blockquote>
<p>On a more serious note, the subject of john oliver came up when a colleague (fellow psychologist) and I were discussing politics a few months ago. Although we were both in agreement regarding the general shitlib inanity of the HBO show, my friend was surprised when I explained that the real insidiousness of it is its unmistakably hypnotic structure and pacing. </p>

<p>I ended up pulling up an episode or two off of youtube to show her what I meant. All of the segments I&#39;ve ever seen from this show follow the same repetitive format: present some &quot;argumentation&quot; and &quot;facts&quot; for about 10 seconds, then quickly follow these up with a snarky quip (which themselves overwhelmingly take the form of complete non-sequitur or otherwise absurd metaphor) before any rational processing of the preceding argument can take place in the mind of the viewer. Further telling is that the only &#39;beats&#39; or mental pauses in the show&#39;s pacing exist solely to highlight the approving laughter or applause of the studio audience. Repeat this basic formula without variation 20-40 times in a row and you have one of the 12-20 minute &#39;segments&#39; that form the backbone of the show. </p>

<p>The end effect is (obviously) not to deliver information, but rather to literally teach the viewers --on a subconscious level -- to mentally associate derisive laughter with any person or opinion that is at odds with the narrative&#39;s take on the chosen issue. And it accomplishes this by maintaining a strict adherence to a roughly 20-second cycle in which a stimulus is presented, and a response is cued. This is the sense in which the show is fundamentally hypnotic in effect -- even moreso than its precursors in the genre (Daily Show, Colbert, etc).</p>

<p>To my mind, oliver&#39;s show is representative of the media&#39;s increasing mastery of the methodologies of mass conditioning; in fact it is almost such a perfect technical accomplishment that I would almost have to admire it on technical grounds, if only it weren&#39;t so troubling a development, which moreover is in the hands of the entirely wrong people.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks for posting this op. I hope it gets plenty of upvotes/visibility.</p>

<p>Even more, I hope people read this and become aware that powerful techniques for mental conditioning are built into the very structure of the show itself.</p>

<p>Once you are aware of this, the technique itself becomes much less effective. I just want to take an opportunity to point out the difference that awareness makes.</p>

<p>Unaware: attempt at mental conditioning = highly effective</p>

<p>Aware: attempt at mental conditioning becomes obvious and loses most/all it&#39;s effectiveness.</p>

<p>Another thought just occurred to me. Most people would be able to see what&#39;s going on with this type of show... if they had some decent quality programming to compare it to.</p>

<p>By that, I mean a TV show where both side of an issue are presented in a fair and unbiased manner... and then discussed calmly and rationally. </p>

<p>AFAIK, there just aren&#39;t any shows like this on TV. Even on most news shows, debates tend to degenerate into arguments, with people taking sides and raising their voices trying to interrupt their opponent at every opportunity. So there just isn&#39;t anything good to compare to.</p>

<p>tldr; You can&#39;t know what a good meal tastes like if you&#39;re being fed junk food every day.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Strong points, certainly no frame of reference to compare it to presently. Also to your point, the average &quot;shot&quot; on TV is less than 2 seconds. This is less true for single camera news shows like Oliver&#39;s, but this is a phenomenon of recent years ushered in with reality TV that has now spread to sitcoms, dramas, and commercials. Works on a similar pretense, if your brain is constantly working to digest the new images on the screen, the viewer is left with no time to process, think, or even subconsciously feel emotions associated with those images (the message). I believe shit length increases in shows like Oliver&#39;s, but it is done deliberately to allow time for their message, and only their message, to sink in (as OP described). </p>

<p>Summary: Quick shot lengths on TV are designed for mindless drudgery UNLESS they have an agenda (like Oliver) that needs to be deliberately and convincingly delivered.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You might want to read up on the thoughts of a guy named Marshall McLuhan. He&#39;s the guy who said, the medium is the message.</p>

<p>This was way back in the 1950&#39;s during the birth of broadcast TV. Back then, a lot of people either didn&#39;t get what he was talking about, or didn&#39;t pay attention. </p>

<p>What he was saying is that the medium of TV itself requires the viewer to be passive receiver. </p>

<p>The internet is fundamentally different. You receive information, but you can also interact. You can participate by making comments, asking questions and posting your own content.</p>

<p>Even if you aren&#39;t as actively engaged, you tend to find yourself surrounded by others who are. I believe this is why TV viewership is declining. Once people get a dose of internet-style activity, TV just doesn&#39;t do it for them anymore.</p>

at least when you are comparing entertainment media on tv.</p>

<p>we studied this a bit when i was doing game design, in our media classes. turning on the TV just turns your brain off, and in to a passive receiver, its pretty easy to tell who watches tv and who doesnt after a 5 min conversation.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah I noticed that when regressives attempted to infiltrate the videogaming industry they got immediately called out. Some developers/publishers continue to support regressives but the audience in general does not. I think it&#39;s true that providing some interaction an ability for users to comment back completely kills the hypnosis effect. I suspect it&#39;s part of the reason Trump is even able to stay in the race despite the unprecedented assault against him by media on TV. The Internet is just that powerful now.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I too noticed this formula while watching this past weekend&#39;s episode - but might it be just a way of keeping audiences engaged despite the presentation of serious (boring) subject matter, and not a sinister ploy to brainwash us all?</p>

<p>If you watch a few episodes, you&#39;ll see that he doesn&#39;t use this exact 20-second formula at all times. Often he does spend several minutes talking about each episode&#39;s subject in finer detail towards the end - the frequent interjection of jokes is usually reserved for the introduction to each episode&#39;s major topic.</p>

<p>This is indeed a pattern which the show employs, but there&#39;s nothing to suggest it&#39;s used in a manipulative fashion. More likely it&#39;s just a way of keeping things light and entertaining - without these occasional jokes, it wouldn&#39;t be much of a comedy show.</p>

The many bankruptcies that he used to fuck small businesses out of money?

</blockquote>

<p>yep- that nails it from what I&#39;ve seen of the show.  he follows every argument with some ridiculous comparison which completely confuses the point he&#39;s making, but emotionally stimulates his viewers into marginalizing the opinions of those on the other side.  His random metaphors could honestly be written by a bot and really just serve to detract from the topics.</p>

<p>I suspect his writers are very young or are writing for a very young audience.  The entire show is structured like a family guy bit, but with a political agenda.  It&#39;s like when someone argues against a &quot;conspiracy theory&quot; by immediately referencing the insanity of alex jones or talking about lizard people.  The Daily Show used to have some intelligence around it, and I MIGHT even argue that Bill Maher&#39;s show did in the 90&#39;s, but this new style of political comedy (Daily Show, Kemal Bell, Larry Wilmore, John Oliver, Marc Maron, Bill Maher) has lost any semblance of nuance and is a ridiculously unfunny advertisement for the Labor/ Democratic party, without espousing any real progressive values other than those cherry picked to fit the narrative.</p>

<p>As for the 2 candidates, Hitlery is just the worse trash of the 2. To even argue, &#39;at least she has the sense to keep her dirty laundry hidden&#39; is basically cognitive dissonance. She has no sense and nothing about her absolute corruption and the murders around her, and the money from Saudi&#39;s, and the weapons sold to Benghazi to Isis and the ambassador dying while she did nothing to cover her ties/tracks, and her racist remarks, and her selling positions in government to the highest bidder......the list is endless and you can fill encyclopedia volumes of her corrupt fuckery.</p>

<p>Trump is not a politician, just a shrewd businessman who has stated for decades that he is a patriot and would run for prez if the country was in dire straits, and this is where we are now, a declining deindutrialized country with various cities turned into 3rd world shitholes (Detroit) and various companies fleeing their operations to mexico or overseas and the entire country being sold out to globalism via Obama/Dems and a number of republicans.</p>

<p>All of the segments I&#39;ve ever seen from this show follow the same repetitive format: present some &quot;argumentation&quot; and &quot;facts&quot; for about 10 seconds, then quickly follow these up with a snarky quip (which themselves overwhelmingly take the form of complete non-sequitur or otherwise absurd metaphor) </p>
</blockquote>

<p>I can&#39;t watch his show because of this cringe-worthy formula. It would be fine if he peppered this in around several other methods, but every time? It&#39;s too bad, because initially the program covered some important topics, like the US `s failing infrastructure. </p>

<p>Maybe i feel an instinctive dislike for his type of repetitive derision with a few arguable facts.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Formula is more than obviously present - even with a accompanying graphics ... I first noticed it with Colbert , although it&#39;s brought to perfection with Oliver .. </p>

<p>But, Colberts new show is lost in time and the world , it is clear that even he feels it ... No clear concept or target , just the obvious &quot;liberal politics&quot; ....</p>

<p>A few jokes, now the obligatory &quot;Trump bash segment&quot; , done halfheartedly ... Really, truly sad. And he shows that. As if almost he is ashamed. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Upvoted because this type of conditioning is one of the last remaining powerful weapons being used. Most people have a great subconscious fear of being laughed at, and when laughter, whether it be canned or real, is associated with certain beliefs or political stances, the social part of the brain begins to make decisions that should belong to the logical part of the brain.</p>

<p>Not only does awareness nullify the conditioning effect, but it tends to reverse it altogether.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You might want to read up on the thoughts of a guy named Marshall McLuhan. He&#39;s the guy who said, the medium is the message.</p>

<p>This was way back in the 1950&#39;s during the birth of broadcast TV. Back then, a lot of people either didn&#39;t get what he was talking about, or didn&#39;t pay attention. </p>

<p>What he was saying is that the medium of TV itself requires the viewer to be passive receiver. </p>

<p>The internet is fundamentally different. You receive information, but you can also interact. You can participate by making comments, asking questions and posting your own content.</p>

<p>Even if you aren&#39;t as actively engaged, you tend to find yourself surrounded by others who are. I believe this is why TV viewership is declining. Once people get a dose of internet-style activity, TV just doesn&#39;t do it for them anymore.</p>
