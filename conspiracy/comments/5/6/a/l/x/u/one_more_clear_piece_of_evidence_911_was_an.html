        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>This is often overlooked, but if you recall during 9/11 there was initially a big scandal regarding the fact that &#39;someone&#39; had shorted the US Stock Market, with the anticipation that it would crash shortly before 9/11 and received a transfer of around $1.2 Trillion as I recall.</p>

<p>At the time it was said this was &#39;Saudi Arabia&#39;, however it was largely ignored in the hunt to blame it on the cave dweller Bin Laden.</p>

<p>Lastly, there was some fuss in the media about recovering these funds but it was said &#39;oh ya, the money is gone, nothing we can do about it now! Impossible to recover said money, block the transfer, or to find out who the money went to...&#39; - And it was never recovered, nor looked into as a potential lead to someone with direct knowledge that 9/11 was to happen, before it happened.</p>

<p>Hope that helps jog your memory.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yep that was one of about 20 proven &#39;motives&#39; for 9/11.  Guess which two people on earth had the means and opportunity?  (don&#39;t say osama bin laden or <em>them terries</em>...he/they didn&#39;t have intimiate knowledge of the COG, the US military protocols in the event that the US was attacked (even if a &#39;training exercise&#39;), so he couldn&#39;t subvert those same protocols in several ways on that day, telling the military to stand down so the planes could fly into buildings and not be shot out of the sky.....he wouldn&#39;t be able to know these things OR be able to get the military to stand down, because he wasn&#39;t--that we know of--in attendance in COG meetings for 3 decades, because Reagan made those meetings a secret by executive order, nor did he have the authority to tell the military what to do on that day.)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Wrong.  Only Dick Cheney and Donald Rumsfeld had the training and the knowledge of the behavior that the US Military intelligence establishment would take under certain conditions of hijacking and terrorist attacks, the exploitable protocols because</p>

<blockquote>
<p>They themselves wrote those protocols in secret session authorized by reagan for decades</p>
</blockquote>

<p>...and therefore had not only this knowledge but the opportunity--being they were in a high position to give orders--to undermine those protocols to allow those planes to hit those buildings.  If DC and DR were asleep on 9/11, it <strong><em>would not have happened</em></strong>.  Why?  Because our government has an immune system.  Because the air force would have shot those planes out of the air.  Because there wouldn&#39;t have been readiness tests within the month that our own intelligence had received a report that there would be a terror attack in the US.  </p>

<p>These two guys created the very specific conditions and occupied a specific niche in our government that &#39;cleared away all obstacles&#39; to allow 9/11 to happen.</p>

<p>No other terrorist orgs</p>

<p>No other people even in our own government</p>

<p>Could have cleared the way for those planes to hit. They were the only 2 on this earth.</p>

<p>And their motivation was to initiate the Continuity of Government and create a fascist coup d&#39;etat in america by making the CIA a rogue internal cryptostate.</p>

<p>And they did</p>

<p>And hillary is not in jail and comey is not in jail and obama and soros are not in jail because......</p>

<p>... the COG is still active and the constitution has been undermined.</p>
