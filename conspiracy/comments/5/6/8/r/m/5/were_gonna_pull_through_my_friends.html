Under Obama, govt has gone so crazy that everyone sees it and damn near everyone realizes he or she could identify with a group they try to label as a threat. It certainly does not mean things improved under Obama.. it just means govt has overplayed their hand.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think we&#39;re getting help from aliens or angels, or we&#39;ve reached a tipping point where our desperation, demoralization and anger has taken us collectively to bruce banner level hulkism.. creating an egregore of vigilantism out of populist sense of justice.</p>

<p>I can tell you that this &#39;sense&#39; of &#39;awakening&#39; is happening at all levels of society, crosscutting socioeconomic groups.  I talked to a blue collar mechanic, they know what&#39;s going on, doctors, lawyers, they know too, computer experts feel the same.  The only people who aren&#39;t onboard are the yoga moms driving priuses to whole foods with coexist stickers (new age or wicca) in asheville and places like this for example the bay area.  Basically it&#39;s the social justice warriors who are really out to lunch in terms of information or are using outdated partisanism, or are just people with ethical problems (like they don&#39;t care Hillary is a criminal).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It clearly says how you can see them. Youtube the lens and you&#39;ll see tons of people who take pictures of &quot;ghosts&quot; it&#39;s all one and the same. There are also numerous articles. Link it to what sacred books call Archons/Djinn/Demons and you&#39;ll see the picture being painted. I am not religious, but I acknowledge those books have a point they are explaining.</p>

<p>Don&#39;t you wonder why no one can fix the world and it keeps going non stop? Our world is the work of a higher intelligence. We all just play along with it, as Queen says &quot;I command your very souls you unbelievers&quot; look at the big picture and you see a completely different thing. I used to look at the world one way, looking at it completely backwards makes infinite times more sense.</p>

<p>&quot;Baby, &#39;fore we came to this country we were kings and queens

Money then became empowerment for Europeans&quot;</p>

<p>You create your own reality. The shadow government does not control my life. They do not control the wolf that attacked me and my dog. It&#39;s an illusion that your brain conjures up based on bias and the construct they create. </p>

<p>Karma is merely if you do XYZ, XYZ will and can happen to you. I don&#39;t believe in that, per se, in the traditional sense. Game over. You learned from your mistakes, but they will not haunt you, nearly remind you. Make sense?</p>

<p>As much as it would be nice to think if you are a shit human being, you will be reincarnated as a pile of shit.. I don&#39;t believe in that...</p>

<p>this i totally agree that how you can turn your own karma around a mistake is something you had to learn from first time to me is allowed but a second same mistake then that was actualy no mistrake yeah?</p>

<p>i wish i could create my own reality then that wolf would never have attacked you or your dog [[[ooo what kind?btw]]] but see you cant fauly the wolf for being a wolf thats his given nature its for you to stay out of his hungrey path</p>

<p>contradiction, and not the point of this realm, or is it?...=contadiction </p>

<p>Sensei said, &quot;you can change at any time and do something different&quot;.  He didn&#39;t say, &quot;you can start at any time&quot;...or &quot;go&quot;.  Though I could tell he was irritated with me, which was rare, because he was very patient.  He repeated, &quot;you can <em>change</em> at any time. and do something different.&quot;    It was covertly insulting but also very loving and extremely wise.</p>

<p>It forced me to think about what the hell was happening, and with this I snapped out of it, succeeded and advanced.  Anyway,  this has stuck with me, this &#39;being allowed to break out of loop, or allowing myself to try something different at any time&#39; has become something of my own.  </p>
