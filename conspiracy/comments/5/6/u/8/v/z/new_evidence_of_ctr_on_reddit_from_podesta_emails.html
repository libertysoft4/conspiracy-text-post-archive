<p>In case he starts deleting, I have archived some account history here <a href="http://archive.is/OsHYi">http://archive.is/OsHYi</a>. <strong>Below I have simply copy/pasted text directly from the WikiLeaks email (3282) to show how it matches to the image above. Links to the posts are included after.</strong></p>

<p><em>In the Senate, Hillary Clinton supported increasing the minimum wage</em> and voted repeatedly to protect and increase it. She was an original cosponsor of the Fair Minimum Wage Act of 2007, and authored the 2006 and 2007 Standing with Minimum Wage Act to tie Congressional salary increases to an increase in the minimum wage.</p>

<p>· <em>As a Senator, Hillary Clinton supported progressive tax policies</em> that required millionaires to pay their fair share. She opposed tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans and corporations in 2001 and 2003, and she supported a variety of middle-class tax cuts, including tax credits for student loan recipients, and keeping in place the tax cuts for those who make under $250,000 a year.</p>

<p>o Clinton has said “that inherited wealth and concentrated wealth is not good for America,” and she has consistently voted against repealing the estate tax on millionaires, doing so in 2001, 2002, and 2006.</p>

<p>· <em>Hillary Clinton supported working families going through difficult times through no fault of their own.</em> In the Senate, she was a bipartisan leader on fighting to extend emergency unemployment benefits.</p>

<p>· <em>Hillary Clinton knows that tomorrow’s shared success starts with today’s child</em>, and her dedication to children began long before she ever entered public office. In fact, her first job out of law school was for the newly-formed Children’s Defense Fund, an organization she would later chair.</p>

<p><em>Hillary Clinton has worked to expand access to early childhood education for children of lower-income families.</em> As First Lady of Arkansas, Hillary Clinton introduced her husband to the HIPPY program, which expanded early childhood education to economically disadvantaged children. In the Senate, Clinton partnered with Kit Bond in an effort to expand voluntary full-day pre-K for children from low-income families. Today, as part of the Too Small to Fail Initiative to improve the health and well-being of children five and under, Hillary Clinton is working to close the “word gap” for kids in low-income families who often have smaller vocabularies than their classmates.</p>

<p><a href="/u/SnatcherBadger">/u/SnatcherBadger</a> seems to do a better job at summarizing CTR&#39;s talking points, but they are definitely still here. Like above, I have copied text directly from the WikiLeaks email (3194) and pasted it here below. A link to the post is at the bottom.</p>

<p><em>MESSAGE:</em> Hillary Clinton has dedicated her life to ensuring that hardworking Americans can succeed. In uncertain times, families need faith that opportunity for their children and grandchildren is alive and well. Hillary Clinton wants the American Dream to be a real possibility for every child and every family across our nation.</p>

<p><em>BOTTOM LINE:</em> Leading the charge for equal pay for equal work, fighting to increase wages, strongly advocating for progressive tax policies and access to education and healthcare to help middle-class families – Hillary Clinton has fought for an America and a future where everyone can rise to their potential.</p>

<p>· <em>Hillary Clinton has worked to expand access to early childhood education for children of lower-income families.</em> As First Lady of Arkansas, Hillary Clinton introduced her husband to the HIPPY program, which expanded early childhood education to economically disadvantaged children. In the Senate, Clinton partnered with Kit Bond in an effort to expand voluntary full-day pre-K for children from low-income families. Today, as part of the Too Small to Fail Initiative to improve the health and well-being of children five and under, Hillary Clinton is working to close the “word gap” for kids in low-income families who often have smaller vocabularies than their classmates.</p>

She was an original cosponsor of the Fair Minimum Wage Act of 2007, and authored the 2006 and 2007 Standing with Minimum Wage Act to tie Congressional salary increases to an increase in the minimum wage.</p>

<p>· *In a San Francisco speech, Clinton revealed some of what may be her economic message: “Who’s on your side?” *According to the Washington Post, “Here in San Francisco on Monday, Clinton gave a spirited call to arms to Democrats as she road-tested what is likely to be her economic message if she runs again. The November midterms, she said, come down ‘to a simple question: Who’s on your side?’ She sounded close to her party’s populist marrow when she decried the erosion of economic security for many working Americans, and a long way from her tone-deaf remark earlier this year about being ‘dead broke’ when she and Bill Clinton left the White House in 2000. ‘It’s time to elect leaders who will fight for everyone to get a fair shot at the American dream,’ Hillary Clinton said.”</p>

</blockquote>

<p>There&#39;s a problem with this. How so?</p>

<p>Reddit is privately owned and run for profit. CTR (or someone associated with them) is a paying customer. We are the product.</p>

<p>Think of it this way. There&#39;s millions and millions of people hanging around reddit everyday. Some come here to look at cute pics of kittens, but many people come here for news and discussion about things that are important to them.</p>

<p>Most of these people are sound asleep. They take what they see on reddit at face value. So this represents a huge block of people that can potentially be influenced. So along comes a customer who&#39;s looking to influence public opinion and they&#39;re willing to pay reddit to let them have a go at us.</p>

<p>You think reddit&#39;s owners are gonna say no... let alone <em>sue</em> them?</p>

<p>If anything, they get pissed off when someone wises up, spots the shilling and manipulation and calls them out on it. This is why they delete such comments and (legitimate) users get banned. This is why shills have the run of the place and never get banned or hassled.</p>

<p>This is what you get as soon as there&#39;s money involved.</p>

<p>1) Encourage Reddit to sue CTR</p>

<p>2) Generate awareness of CTR</p>

<p>If you&#39;re right then it needs stop asap or we need to get off this website.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>This is your best strategy. Why?</p>

<p>Because of a couple of reasons. One, if we just run away to some dinky little site where &quot;they&#39;ll leave us alone&quot; they win. We should stick around and keep sticking it to them.</p>

<p>The second reason for generating awareness of CTR is that it reduced their effectiveness. Once people realize what&#39;s going on, they don&#39;t just accept things at face value. Instead of looking at CTR-influenced content, they see <em>through</em> it.</p>

<p>That makes a huge difference.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I do kind of hope that something better will come along and replace reddit, but I think they&#39;ve hit the sweet spot in a way like facebook did with social media. Think about it, there was already a bunch of sites like fb, such as myspace or friendster, so it wasn&#39;t a unique or even better experience, they just found the right set of users and cemented their place. It&#39;s the same with reddit, there was digg or stumbleupon, and reddit just happened to be the one that won out.</p>

<p>Besides, even if something uprooted reddit, there&#39;s no way that anything this popular would stay a &quot;bastion of free speech,&quot; it would be just as susceptible to CTR. Maybe even more so. Imagine a group like CTR creating a reddit replacement with the intention of being an alternative. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It looks like I have 2 days left on this current ban instead of a couple more months. Much appreciated, but I&#39;m still curious as to how what I did is considered spamming. Were my 5 comments <em>on different posts</em> really considered spam?</p>

<blockquote>
<p><a href="http://imgur.com/sXa6vgO">Spamming the same comment 4 or more times is against are rules, which you can find in the wiki on the sidebar.</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>I could never find this rule that <a href="/u/tme001">/u/tme001</a> mentioned, but none of my comments were the exact same anyway. So even if the rule he described actually existed his argument doesn&#39;t really hold up, right?</p>

<p>Thanks again and I do appreciate it, but an explanation is honestly more important to me than the unban at this point. And considering my ban was commuted it also seems like my mute is even less justified. <a href="http://imgur.com/gAZiSci">I was muted looking for an explanation</a>. <a href="http://imgur.com/RMbeFQi">And then simply ignored the second time I asked</a>.</p>

<p>Did you look at my posts and see that they were not the same and that they were posted in <em>different</em> posts? Can 5 comments really break a subreddit? No, right? Isn&#39;t that what the downvote button is for instead of silencing dissent?</p>

<p>What if <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a> allows continued duplicate posts for certain political agendas (e.g. there are two posts about Rudy Giuliani not remembering standing next to HRC on 9/11). Am I allowed to paste the same comment into both?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s my point. There&#39;s been a lot of bans lately over in <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a>. I&#39;m sure many are justified, but how is it that 5 <em>different</em> comments are considered spam? My ban may have been commuted, yes, but it still doesn&#39;t make sense why I was banned in the first place or why my ban was commuted. I&#39;m either guilty or I&#39;m not, right? If I didn&#39;t do anything wrong then why do I still have 2 more days left on my ban?</p>

<p>And on another note, transparency is a good thing. Nobody should get banned for breaking a secret rule. If I get an answer here maybe another Redditor will read it and go on to never break that rule ever in <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a>. Wouldn&#39;t that be a good thing?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You have to think about the sheer size of politics, and therefore the amount of value that spammers see in fucking with it. I bet, as mods, they&#39;ve had long-winded, annoying, borderline mind-numbing conversations about the spam problem plaguing their subreddit. </p>

<p>They&#39;ve probably gotten buttfucked by spammers so much, no matter what direction they turn, at such a fast space, they&#39;ve turned to hiding the rules from the spammers so that they can stop the spam-rape that occurs. </p>

<p>Or they could just use the secret spam rule as a catch-all for banning opposition. Im playing devil&#39;s advocate however cause being a mod fucking blows. </p>

<p>I&#39;ve been banned from <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a> before for &quot;harassment&quot; or whatever. inlammatory speech. So here&#39;s what i did to fight back:</p>

<p>I reported everyone in every thread for 5 straight days who engaged in that towards me. I actually started to see a difference being made in Shill content. It was actually cool. Go review my post history to see if you can spot where i used it lol.</p>

<p>but yeah as a whole, i wish <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a> would stop letting their subreddit get gamed. </p>

Others were discussing it in various subs on Monday as well.</p>

<p>Maybe if you&#39;re better than I am at digging you can find something in /politics about an official statement. What others were saying in diff subs is that /politics thinks they weren&#39;t verified/are faked, or it was the Russians or something. Who knows. </p>

And what if at the same time that party is telling independents that &quot;you shouldn&#39;t interfere with other parties&quot;?</p>

<p>At that point should we hate democracy? Or should we hate the hypocritical party that subverted our democracy?</p>

Democracy is merely mob rule. It&#39;s very similar to a totalitarian dictatorship in that your rights are secondary to the &quot;public good&quot;</p>

<p>That&#39;s exactly what the DNC did this year. But it certainly didn&#39;t represent a functional democracy.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Natural rights are pre-existing and preclude govt. Democracy is merely mob rule.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Ok. So are you saying Hillary will give/preserve more personal rights than Bernie Sanders would have? Personally I think there&#39;s no contest. Bernie was our best choice but like I said... the DNC undemocratically stole the nomination from him. That&#39;s pretty much the whole point here, unless you&#39;re suggesting we get rid of democracy in favor of something else. If so, what do you intend to replace it with and how would you go about making that change?</p>

<blockquote>

<p>I really disagree with you here especially today in the information age. It&#39;s just... we didn&#39;t get true information this year.</p>

Got banned for spam, then the mod edits his removal posts to say comment spam, a rule not in the sidebar and &quot;comment spam&quot; has no definition in the rules. The ban was under spam but the corrupt mod used a rule under trolling to ban me. Caught the same mod in his post history posting Trump supporting users comment history to r/spam to try and get them banned from reddit. Fucking corrupt as shit. Not even a timed ban but a lifetime ban after 16000 comment karma and reddit gold for previous submissions to /politics. Fuck that sub and its bought and paid for mods.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>TLDR: The Democrats have been illegally supplying Iran&#39;s Nuclear Program since 2009. Obama, John Kerry, and Hillary Clinton have all benefited financially from it.</p>

<p>Hillary Clinton has ties to the mining/commodity trading industry through her old criminal pal Marc Rich. Through Rich&#39;s company Glencore, Hillary Clinton can be tied to:</p>

<p>Terrorism, the Drug trade, Iran&#39;s Nuclear Program, North Korea, and even Apartheid South Africa</p>

<p>Everyone largely believes that Hillary Clinton is corrupt. I believe so too, but I believe it&#39;s in a different vein of corruption. I believe there is a long running criminal conspiracy in our Government that dates back to the 1970s in its origin, and continues to this day. In order to prove that point, I need to answer a few questions :</p>

<p>Who is Marc Rich?</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marc_Rich">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marc_Rich</a></p>

<p>Marc Rich was born December 18, 1934 and died on June 26, 2013. He was a businessmen, his focus was in banking and trade commodities. </p>

<p>Rich founded the commodities trading giant Glencore. Today it is the World&#39;s 3rd largest family business, and the 10th largest company on the Fortune Global 500 list. It has headquarters in Switzerland, London, the Netherlands, and Jersey. As well subsidiaries all around the globe. Without a doubt its primary interests are oil, gas, and mining.</p>

<p>Marc Rich was indicted in the United States in 1983 with business partner Picnus Green and fled the country.</p>

<p>What did Marc Rich do?</p>

<p><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/27/business/marc-rich-pardoned-financier-dies-at-78.html?partner=rss&amp;amp;emc=rss&amp;amp;smid=tw-nytimes&amp;amp;_r=0">http://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/27/business/marc-rich-pardoned-financier-dies-at-78.html?partner=rss&amp;amp;emc=rss&amp;amp;smid=tw-nytimes&amp;amp;_r=0</a></p>

<p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/jun/26/marc-rich-commodities-trader-fugitive-dies?INTCMP=SRCH">https://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/jun/26/marc-rich-commodities-trader-fugitive-dies?INTCMP=SRCH</a></p>

<p>Marc Rich and Pincus Green were indicted on 65 criminal counts including: tax evasion, wire fraud, racketeering, and trading with Iran during the 1973-1974 Oil Embargo, when Rich used contacts in Iran and Iraq to circumvent the sanctions.</p>

<p>In his own biography, and to his biographer Daniel Amann, Rich said his &quot;most important and most profitable&quot; business deals happened by violating international trade embargoes and doing business with the apartheid regime of South Africa.</p>

<p>Rich admitted to doing business with: Apartheid South Africa, Fidel Castro&#39;s Cuba, Marxist Angola, the Nicaraguan Sandinistas, Gaddafi&#39;s Libya, Ceausescu&#39;s Romania, and Pinochet&#39;s Chile.</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_of_Credit_and_Commerce_International#American_inquiries_and_legal_actions">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_of_Credit_and_Commerce_International#American_inquiries_and_legal_actions</a></p>

<p>Rich was also believed to be involved with the Bank of Credit and Commerce International: a bank which was closed down for laundering money for people such as Saddamm Hussein, Manuel Noriega, and the Medellin Cartel and the terrorist group Abu Nidal. Rich was even reported to have been involved in arms deals in Iraq in the 1980s.</p>

<p>Okay, that&#39;s who Marc Rich was. By why is that important?</p>

<p>Marc Rich was pardoned by President Bill Clinton on January 20, 2001, hours before leaving office, in what the New York Times would call one of history&#39;s most &quot;flagrant abuses of presidential power.&quot;</p>

<p>Why was Rich&#39;s pardon so bad?</p>

<p>Long story short? Rich bought his pardon.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/news/pardoned-financier-marc-rich-dead-at-78/">http://www.cbsnews.com/news/pardoned-financier-marc-rich-dead-at-78/</a></p>

<p>Rich funneled $1 million to the Democratic party, including more than $100,000 to Hillary Clinton&#39;s Senate Campaign in New York, and $450,000 to the Clinton Library foundation.</p>

<p>It was arguably the most controversial moment of Clinton&#39;s presidency. He went on to defend it, even citing the arguments of another controversial pardon receiver, one &quot;Scooter&quot; Libby.</p>

<p><a href="http://legaltimes.typepad.com/files/121908-jamescomey.pdf">http://legaltimes.typepad.com/files/121908-jamescomey.pdf</a></p>

<p>Then Deputy Attorny General Eric Holder argued for Rich&#39;s pardon. Eric Holder was Obama&#39;s first Attorney General</p>

<p>The pardon of Marc Rich was so controversial there was a federal hearing on it. It was originally prosecuted by Federal Prosecutor Mary Jo White, but she stepped down and was replaced by the current director of the FBI James Comey, who ultimately found &quot;No evidence of criminal activity.&quot; According to the Washington Post.</p>

<p><a href="http://nypost.com/2001/03/27/brits-seize-2-million-bound-for-marc-rich/">http://nypost.com/2001/03/27/brits-seize-2-million-bound-for-marc-rich/</a></p>

<p>Just more evidence of Rich&#39;s drug ties.</p>

<p>The Clinton Pardons/Drug ties of People involved</p>

<p>Now, Marc Rich hard long standing ties to terrorist organizations and the drug trade.</p>

<p>For a moment, I want to focus on the latter, and not the former.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2001/08/26/us/roger-clinton-s-dogged-effort-for-drug-trafficker.html?ref=topics">http://www.nytimes.com/2001/08/26/us/roger-clinton-s-dogged-effort-for-drug-trafficker.html?ref=topics</a></p>

<p>Clinton considered pardoning a known drug trafficker after a man, one Tommy Gambino, approached Clinton&#39;s brother Roger Clinton on a golf course, handed him a rolex watch and had a conversation about presuading his brother to do so.</p>

<p>Roger Clinton&#39;s efforts to get Rosario Gambino pardoned were so persistent the FBI investigated them.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2001/02/23/us/clinton-pardons-brothers-siblings-who-often-emerge-unflattering-spotlight.html">http://www.nytimes.com/2001/02/23/us/clinton-pardons-brothers-siblings-who-often-emerge-unflattering-spotlight.html</a></p>

<p>Roger has a long history of involvment in cocaine.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2015/04/hillary-clinton-brothers-hugh-tony-rodham-116674">http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2015/04/hillary-clinton-brothers-hugh-tony-rodham-116674</a></p>

<p>But Roger also received a pardon for cocaine conviction.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2015/04/hillary-clinton-hugh-tony-rodham">http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2015/04/hillary-clinton-hugh-tony-rodham</a></p>

<p>Hugh Rodham, Hillary Clinton&#39;s brother, received $434,000 to lobby for a pardon of a cocaine trafficker, and he did so successfully.</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ATF_gunwalking_scandal">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ATF_gunwalking_scandal</a></p>

<p>Now, some may say it&#39;s disingenous to say Eric Holder has drug ties. But he is tied to the late Marc Rich, and we should all remember the time he helped facilitate the transfer of firearms to Mexican Drug Cartels.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.hsbc.com/news-and-insight/media-resources/media-releases/2013/former-us-deputy-attorney-general-joins-hsbc-board">http://www.hsbc.com/news-and-insight/media-resources/media-releases/2013/former-us-deputy-attorney-general-joins-hsbc-board</a></p>

<p>Current FBI Director James Comey sat on the board of banking giant HSBC.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.rollingstone.com/politics/news/outrageous-hsbc-settlement-proves-the-drug-war-is-a-joke-20121213">http://www.rollingstone.com/politics/news/outrageous-hsbc-settlement-proves-the-drug-war-is-a-joke-20121213</a></p>

<p>The same Banking Giant that launders drug cartel money. And has been caught, charged and fined for doing so.</p>

<p><a href="https://investments.hsbc.co.uk/news/company/24989264/glencore-gallops-higher-as-liberum-bullish-on-china-s-coal-policy">https://investments.hsbc.co.uk/news/company/24989264/glencore-gallops-higher-as-liberum-bullish-on-china-s-coal-policy</a></p>

<p>HSBC is also responsible for many of Glencore&#39;s investments. Again, Glencore was founded by the criminal Marc Rich, who paid for a pardon by former President Bill Clinton. A pardon which was investigated by James Comey, who sat on the board of HSBC, which laundered drug cartel money, and did business with a company that worked intimately with drug traffickers. Comey found &quot;No evidence of criminal activity.&quot;</p>

<p>Okay, so Glencore, the Clinton&#39;s, HSBC, the director the FBI are somehow all linked to eachother and to drug cartels. So what? Where does this lead.</p>

<p>Okay, now this is where things begin to get a little technical, and more questions have to get answered.</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Podesta">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Podesta</a></p>

<p>John Podesta is the Chariman of the 2016 Hillary Clinton presidential campaign. He also was the Counselor to the President for Barack Obama, the White House Chief of Staff for Bill Clinton, and he also</p>

<p><a href="https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/4635">https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/4635</a></p>

<p>Owns 75,000 shares of an energy company known as Joule Unlimited Technologies, Inc.</p>

<p>Who or what is Joule Unlimited Technologies, Inc?</p>

<p>I&#39;m glad you asked. <a href="http://www.jouleunlimited.com/">http://www.jouleunlimited.com/</a></p>

<p>Joule Unlimited is another comodities trading giant, founded by Noubar Afeyan, and has a certain Russian Politician on it&#39;s board.</p>

<p>One Anatoly Chubais </p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatoly_Chubais">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatoly_Chubais</a></p>

<p>Chubais of course, being a Russian politician, works for Vladimir Putin</p>

<p><a href="http://www.newsweek.com/whats-behind-putin-shuffle-kremlin-453675">http://www.newsweek.com/whats-behind-putin-shuffle-kremlin-453675</a></p>

<p>Chubais actually invited Putin to St. Petersburg in 1996.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.jouleunlimited.com/joule-audi">http://www.jouleunlimited.com/joule-audi</a></p>

<p>Joule Unlimited Partners with Audi. Which is owned by Volkswagen.</p>

<p>Let&#39;s talk terrorism</p>

<p><a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-09-28/qatar-fund-stands-to-lose-5-9-billion-on-vw-glencore-stakes">http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-09-28/qatar-fund-stands-to-lose-5-9-billion-on-vw-glencore-stakes</a></p>

<p>Volkswagen, via it&#39;s stake holders in Qatar, is intimately tied with, that&#39;s right, none other than Glencore.</p>

<p><a href="http://english.aawsat.com/2011/05/article55246399/alwaleed-kingdom-invest-400-mln-in-glencore-ipo">http://english.aawsat.com/2011/05/article55246399/alwaleed-kingdom-invest-400-mln-in-glencore-ipo</a></p>

<p>Saudi billionaire Prince Alwaleed(Remember the one that was mean to Trump?) invested $400 million into Glencore&#39;s IPO in 2011.</p>

<p>Why are the Saudi&#39;s, Qatar, and the Democrats interested in Glencore? Short Answer? Terroism and money. Long answer? Terrorism and money.</p>

<p>Glencore is a trading company. They trade lots of things.</p>

<p>Once Gadaffi fell in 2011, they began trading Libyan oil again.</p>

<p>They trade Yemen&#39;s oil</p>

<p>They trade Iraqi oil.</p>

<p>Once the Iran deal was hitched, they began trading Iranian copper.</p>

<p>In 2012 and 2013, they were caught trading aluminum to Iran&#39;s nuclear program(which was against international law at the time).</p>

<p>And as Time reads, government policy since 2008(Gee what happened in 2008? Hmm) has made it so Glencore could sit back and make &quot;EASY MONEY&quot;</p>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/wikileaks/status/786646253358768128">https://twitter.com/wikileaks/status/786646253358768128</a></p>

<p>Wikileaks has shown us Saudi Arabia and Qatar, Glencore investors TIED to Joule Unlimited and John Podesta, and thus in multiple directions James Comey, The Clintons, and the democrats, fund ISIS. And Qatar Gave Bill Clinton $1 million for a 5 minute meeting in 2011</p>

<p>$1 million for a five minute meeting in 2011? Didn&#39;t Gadaffi fall in 2011? Didn&#39;t Saudi Arabia invest $400 million into Glencore in 2011? Didn&#39;t Glencore begin trading Libyan Oil in 2011?</p>

<p>YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES</p>

<p>Does it go deeper? See above</p>

<p><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/11/us/politics/keystone-pipeline.html">http://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/11/us/politics/keystone-pipeline.html</a></p>

<p>What&#39;s that?META EDIT:I NEED TO EXPAND THIS PART Glencore is tied to the Keystone Pipeline?</p>

<p>Okay, let&#39;s slow down and take a step back. So Glencore is evil. But what does that REALLY have to do with Hillary Clinton? Where&#39;s the connection?</p>

<p>Right under our noses.</p>

<p>Goldman Sachs, Glencore, and Tony Rodham((Weird how they&#39;re all tied to Hillary)) have shady, shady mining deals</p>

<p><a href="http://www.northkoreatimes.com/index.php/sid/233981609">http://www.northkoreatimes.com/index.php/sid/233981609</a></p>

<p>Glencore is still working with North Korea. They are trying to have an aluminum monopoly in the US, and have been busted selling aluminum to the Iranian nuclear program...are they funding the North Korean one as well?</p>

<p><a href="https://www.fastmarkets.com/base-metals-news/asia/focus-china-looks-north-korea-plug-glencore-zinc-concs-gap/">https://www.fastmarkets.com/base-metals-news/asia/focus-china-looks-north-korea-plug-glencore-zinc-concs-gap/</a></p>

<p>Glencore&#39;s chinese section, Xtrata, has deep ties to heavy metal mining and North Korea, including aluminum and nickel</p>

<p><a href="http://af.reuters.com/article/sudanNews/idAFLDE76B1Q420110712">http://af.reuters.com/article/sudanNews/idAFLDE76B1Q420110712</a></p>

<p>Glencore also benefits from trading Sudanese Oil. They sure have no problem showing up where human rights violations occur</p>

<p><a href="https://www.wfp.org/content/un-agency-buys-377-million-australian-wheat-glencore">https://www.wfp.org/content/un-agency-buys-377-million-australian-wheat-glencore</a></p>

<p>Glencore gets mining contracts in North Korea via China, and gets to sell food futures to North Korea via the United Nations. It&#39;s amazing how centered around Glencore the world&#39;s elite actually are.</p>

<p>The success of Glencore is directly tied to the success of the Chinese government. Note how Trump wants to be tougher on China, but Clinton does not.</p>

<p><a href="https://ramumine.wordpress.com/tag/glencore-xstrata/">https://ramumine.wordpress.com/tag/glencore-xstrata/</a></p>

<p>Remember the Honduran coup? Guess which company benefitted from Hillary&#39;s mucking about in Honduras? That&#39;s right, Glencore.</p>

<p>Okay, so for years Glencore has been benefiting from Hillary&#39;s foriegn policy. But how does Hillary Benefit from Glencore? Let&#39;s move to Canada for a bit, shall we?</p>

<p><a href="https://www.bostonglobe.com/news/nation/2016/08/19/clinton-foundation-ban-would-not-apply-some-related-charities/iuVtc828bEjGWfjgSxJZ5M/story.html">https://www.bostonglobe.com/news/nation/2016/08/19/clinton-foundation-ban-would-not-apply-some-related-charities/iuVtc828bEjGWfjgSxJZ5M/story.html</a></p>

<p>The Canadian branch of the Clintons, The Clinton-Giustra Enterprise, which accepts money from the same mining industry the Clinton&#39;s have been linked to, the same mining industry benefiting from all of Hillary and Bill&#39;s foreign policy &#39;blunders&#39; over the years, would not be excluded, and certainly have not been so far, from being tied to her.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/1100-donors-to-a-canadian-charity-tied-to-clinton-foundation-remain-secret/2015/04/28/c3c0f374-edbc-11e4-8666-a1d756d0218e_story.html">https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/1100-donors-to-a-canadian-charity-tied-to-clinton-foundation-remain-secret/2015/04/28/c3c0f374-edbc-11e4-8666-a1d756d0218e_story.html</a></p>

<p>The Clinton-Giustra Enterprise has SECRET DONORS, which are largely from the Mining/Commodity industry, which has been the beneficiary of ALL OF CLINTON&#39;S ACTIONS</p>

<p><a href="http://www.ctvnews.ca/canada/canadian-charity-linked-with-clinton-foundation-defends-high-costs-1.2980962">http://www.ctvnews.ca/canada/canadian-charity-linked-with-clinton-foundation-defends-high-costs-1.2980962</a></p>

<p>The Clinton-Giustra Enterprise Charity has extremely high costs, with extremely low return. Seems like a great way to launder money into yourself</p>

<p>Giustra, a mining billionaire, sources donations in Canada from his crooked friends for Crooked Hillary.</p>

<p>There you have it folks. A Massive money laundering scheme spanning from US to Asia to the Middle East and back to Canada, in order for the Clinton&#39;s and pals to get around international law.</p>

<p>In other words, Glencore.</p>

I found this chart really helpful when I quit my 2-pack a day of 27&#39;s habit- <a href="https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/originals/3f/84/76/3f84765cc5dcb78e1bc6f424df03071d.gif">https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/originals/3f/84/76/3f84765cc5dcb78e1bc6f424df03071d.gif</a></p>

<p>PM me if you need anything on my end, even just knowing someone else has made it through the same thing can be super helpful. Plus if you have a ps4 or xbox one we can play a game online or something if you&#39;re so inclined.</p>

<p>Also weed, smoke weed.</p>
