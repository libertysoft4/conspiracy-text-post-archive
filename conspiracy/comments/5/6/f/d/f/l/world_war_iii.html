    <div class="md"><p>They are trying to coax China into the conspiracy by letting Chinese government officials sit on the boards of NWO private central banks, such as the federal reserve, in exchange for making the yuan part of the BIS &quot;basket of reserve currencies;&quot; but China herself still refuses to take the parasite, and the renmimbi, China&#39;s <em>real</em> currency, stays effectively out of their reach despite its growing influence. Their intention is that China become their new military enforcer, but that cannot happen until she does take the parasite.</p>

<p>CFR/IFA thinks it&#39;s just that the communist party doesn&#39;t want to relinquish control, but with enough assurance that the conspiracy will actually enhance their tyranny, they will eventually come around, in spite of the glaring example of what the parasite has done first to Great Britain, and then the US. Their position is actually quite precarious though; the window to get control of China&#39;s money has been open twenty years too long, and now WWIII is about to start, with the US already groomed for many decades to be the big loser. As it stands, the parasite will probably come out of it with nothing but dead and dying hosts, and no military enforcer with which to capture new ones.</p>

<p>A nuclear war possibility is not to be laughed at and somehow, at the back of your head, you already know.</p>
