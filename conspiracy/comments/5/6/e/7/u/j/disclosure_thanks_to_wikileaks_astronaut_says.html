    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m just going to leave my reply here...</p>

<p>This is nothing but an email sent by a known UFO/ETI fanatic, Terri Donovan Mansfield. Notice that if you search her email through Wikileaks&#39; search engine, only emails SENT BY <a href="mailto:terrimansfield@aol.org">terrimansfield@aol.org</a> show up. Keep in mind, ANYONE could have sent John Podesta an email, and it could have potentially showed up on these recent leaks.</p>

<p>On the &quot;About&quot; section of her official website, you can deduce that this person is actually batshit insane. Here&#39;s a direct quote from her brief description:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Terri Donovan Mansfield is the Executive Vice President for Fundraising in the Public Interest (FPI), founded by President and CEO Suzanne Mendelssohn, PhD, Earth’s only <strong>ETI obedience healer</strong> as well as science intuitive for tau neutrino zero point energy (ZPE).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What the hell is an &quot;ETI obedience healer&quot; to begin with? I firmly believe that the email sent is real, but it is nothing more than a spam email sent by a fanatic. That&#39;s just what I gathered after quick research.</p>

<p>So no, this isn&#39;t &quot;Project Blue Beam&quot;, save your tinfoil hats for later.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Considering Edgar Mitchell would have been about 84 at this time, it makes sense he needed a close friend to send emails on his behalf, hence his mentioning Terri and Terri&#39;s cousin in the email. Example:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>My Catholic colleague Terri Mansfield will be there too</p>
</blockquote>

<p>...but then the author signs off as Edgar, with 6th man on the moon in his signature as well as that personal PS line.</p>

<p>So I have a theory, Assange is going to slowly push full disclosure, by releasing carefully chosen Podesta emails in 2000 email batches, to ease people into this over the next 6 months or so. Those following this issue know that <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/john-podesta-hillary-clinton-ufos_us_56d730c9e4b03260bf78f129">Podesta has been all for disclosure</a>. The kicker is that if Assange can push any president to admit to full disclosure, in addition to overwhelm social media and eventually mainstream media to cover this topic, that&#39;s likely the ONE thing that will absolve him of all wrongdoing. The corrupt infrastructure that&#39;s keeping him under house arrest would surely break down within about a year of full disclosure, so he can return home, just like ET. [See what I did there]</p>

    <div class="md"><p>And does that describe why we have never gone back?</p>

<p>But seriously, there are many interesting questions regarding the moon landings, why we stopped going, no rovers I believe there, some of the astronauts comments, etc.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;d suggest researching the issue a bit more thoroughly before making a bunch of  debunked hoaxer statements... There are a lot of reasonable explanations why we didn&#39;t go back, and why we&#39;re looking at going back in the next 10-15 years.</p>

<p>At any rate, the simplest reason we never went back: Money. Its very, very expensive to go to the moon. A single Saturn V rocket cost $1 billion USD, and that doesn&#39;t include any of the support costs associated with a flight. During the height of the Apollo program, NASA got 4.5% of the entire federal budget. Today, its 0.5%. Even in the 1970&#39;s (shortly after Apollo ended), the budget was cut significantly - the budget went from 2% of federal spending to 1% by the end of the decade.</p>

<p>If you look at the history of spaceflight on all the missions afterwards, there&#39;s been a common, somewhat understandable trend: smaller probes, cheaper probes, and more often. During the Apollo era, you had a  rocket capable of putting ~100,000kg into LEO. Today, because of budget cuts, the best rockets currently put about 30,000kg into LEO. However, the trend is reversing pretty quickly with SLS, ITS, and New Glenn, among other rockets. </p>

<p>Also, I&#39;d suggest looking into the Chinese reconnaissance pictures of the moon landing sites. If we didn&#39;t go, then the Chinese could have easily called us out on it, but instead provided hi-rez pictures of everything we left on the moon.</p>

<p>And on the other side, why we&#39;re going back soon: Costs to get payload into orbit are plummeting due to SpaceX and likely what Blue Origin is bringing soon, due to re-usability. That billion-dollar-rocket that took people to the moon 50 years ago is getting re-built and updated by SpaceX/Blue Origin, and the cost is dropping from a billion USD to $100 million, and a lot of the huge overhead costs (tracking, pilots, ect) are getting cheaper, too, due to technology innovations making it cheaper to do missions.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I believed a lot of the same things you did, before I started understanding rocketry and how spaceflight works.. Ultimately, it comes down to the fact that the government spent a lot (and I mean a lot) of money on the Apollo missions... If you get into rocketry and understanding space flight, you realize how much money the government poured into the designs, and they pushed technology so far in 10 years, there really isn&#39;t a way to compare it to anything the government (really) has done prior, or done again.</p>

<p>But again, it all comes down to money - various administrations have tried to make it a point to go back to the moon, but the next one usually kills the program. George Bush wanted us to go back and started pushing the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constellation_program">Constellation Program</a> for us to go back to the moon. </p>

<p>Guess how long the program lasted? &#39;Till he left office. Then Obama started the Space Launch System, which really doesn&#39;t quite have the Lunar goal, but the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Launch_System">Space Launch System</a> (which is close to being done) looks really similar to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ares_I#Cancellation">Ares I</a> that Bush-era NASA proposed.. So yeah, the various administrations have rather screwed over the idea of going back to the moon, because <em>they</em> want to take credit for it, as opposed to a prior administration. Alternatively, its why SpaceX or Blue Origin will probably get to the moon or Mars first - since they&#39;re private corporations, there&#39;s no 4 or 8 year cycle that scrubs their ideas. </p>

<p><em>edit</em> one note that may come up: &quot;Why not spend all that money, and just fake the moon landing/save the money?&quot; - one great issue is that we&#39;ve been using all the technology developed during the Apollo era on pretty much every craft since we went to the moon. For example, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocketdyne_J-2#History">4th Stage LH2/Lox engine, the J-2</a> was absolutely revolutionary when it was put on the Saturn - its why we went to the moon and the Soviets didn&#39;t (LH2 is vastly more efficient to get to the moon, or outside of Earth&#39;s orbit than any other fuel used prior).. J-2 engines are still being updated and are candidates for recent rockets, like the Bush-era Constellation vehicles. Actually, it&#39;s also on the in-development SLS. Its finally being surpassed by modern Methlox engines, but its taken 50 years to find something better, and even then, rival nations have barely begun to utilize LH2-derived engines, which NASA figured out in the 60&#39;s. Why? Because NASA hasn&#39;t had that kind of money available since then, and NASA developed so much good technology that they (likely) advanced rocket technology about 30 years in the same span, due to that much funding.</p>

<p>Another note is that the math on the Saturn V makes no sense to fake it all... Everyone saw the Saturn V launch, and unless NASA lied about engine specs (which doesn&#39;t work when those engines were used on other space craft), then it means they did launch a 6-million-pound rocket... If you put up <em>that</em> much stuff in space, then it should go somewhere. If you put up that much stuff, why not the moon? Or another tantalizing target? If you just wanted to fake a launch, you could have used a lot of other, smaller, rockets... But no, they used the biggest one ever created. </p>

<p>I&#39;m aware of what Project Blue Beam is. I don&#39;t believe in it, I think it&#39;s pure hogwash. Feel free to convince me that it&#39;s not, and also show me how PBB is related to this email.</p>

<p>Blue Beam? It&#39;s a fact and unclassified. You know, like REX 84. Calling people fucktwits and tin foil hat wearing, is insulting, especially when we are justified in curiosity and doubt of how honest the government is. </p>

<p>You should reassess your approach. But, what do I know. I&#39;m just a tin foil hat wearing &quot;fuck twit&quot;...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Agreed.    My clue was that Daniel Sheehan--who has been a bulwark against deepstate abuses in the past, and generally not an asshole--has been talking about the vatican exposing the &#39;big secret&#39; that there are aliens.  His two organizations, the christic institute and the romero institute are fully Jesuit funded, although he himself claims not to be (debunk me on this).  I like Sheehan, despite him being aligned with Jesuits, because he&#39;s done proven work for the underclass and for &#39;regular people&#39;.  </p>

<p>Sheehan was one of the constitutional lawyers that was included to evaluate the recent WTC7 evaluation results and seems convinced 911 was an inside job, asking all the right questions, so you can conclude he&#39;s not totally darkside.</p>

<p>But like many control grid operators they love to mix fact with fiction, it&#39;s just with Sheehan it&#39;s like 99:1 ratio.  That&#39;s what makes the seduction so compelling.  I know for certain that Jesuits are control grid, but perhaps even they themselves have factions and it&#39;s still possible that Sheehan has been psyopped himself, by their ongoing appeal to his vanity, making him a rube.  For example, when he took the case for the church of scientology, he was shown &#39;their biggest secrets&#39;, etc.  I&#39;ve considered he could just be a useless idiot himself and that the secret &#39;consciousness experiments results&#39; he&#39;s been privy to were maybe themselves (verylikely) skewed to give the impression that things aren&#39;t as they seem, when in fact they are exactly that.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hillary has talked about UFOs publicly, and has promised to shed some light on the subject. </p>

<p>She&#39;s probably lying though. </p>

<p>However, she and Bill did get a briefing from the late Laurance Rockefeller (UFO disclosure advocate, grandson of John D. Rockefeller, brother of David). </p>

<p>Oh, and Mitchell wasn&#39;t the only astronaut advocating UFO disclosure. Mercury astronaut Gordon Cooper was also a public believer, and there are good interviews with him (on camera) online. </p>

<p>Other notable public UFO disclosure advocates include Paul Hellyer, former secretary of defense in Canada. Plus at least a few dozen high ranking military (including admirals and generals) and intelligence officials (+ scientists and flight controllers) from the US and other Western countries. There are quite a few good eyewitness testimonies available on YouTube. </p>

<p><a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/john-podesta-hillary-clinton-ufos_us_56d730c9e4b03260bf78f129">http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/john-podesta-hillary-clinton-ufos_us_56d730c9e4b03260bf78f129</a></p>

<p>This was a few months after the Email ID 1802. Could be a coincidence but in my experience, there is no such thing as a coincidence.</p>

<p>I know that he has always been a big proponent for disclosure so there&#39;s that as well. However, this is roughly 4% of the entirety of emails so keep that in mind.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t think it&#39;s a fake email, but just because Podesta received an email from someone doesn&#39;t mean he acknowledged it or even knew what the fuck the guy was talking about. If there was some response from Podesta confirming his agreement about ETI, I might be a little less skeptical, but you can&#39;t stop random people from emailing you. </p>

<p>&quot;Edgar D. Mitchell, lunar module pilot for Apollo 14 and the sixth human to walk on the moon, died peacefully in his sleep following a short illness. His death on February 4, 2016 coincided with the 45th anniversary of the Apollo 14 flight (January 31 – February 9, 1971). He was 85 years old.&quot;</p>

<p>I wonder if he was going to go public, or release more information and the government had him taken care of.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is nothing but an email sent by a known UFO/ETI fanatic, Terri Donovan Mansfield. Notice that if you search her email through Wikileaks&#39; search engine, only emails SENT BY <a href="mailto:terrimansfield@aol.org">terrimansfield@aol.org</a> show up. Keep in mind, ANYONE could have sent John Podesta an email, and it could have potentially showed up on these recent leaks.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.terrimansfield.com/terri/">On the &quot;About&quot; section of her official website,</a> you can deduce that this person is actually batshit insane. Here&#39;s a direct quote from her brief description:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Terri Donovan Mansfield is the Executive Vice President for Fundraising in the Public Interest (FPI), founded by President and CEO Suzanne Mendelssohn, PhD, Earth’s only <strong>ETI obedience healer</strong> as well as science intuitive for tau neutrino zero point energy (ZPE).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What the hell is an &quot;ETI obedience healer&quot; to begin with? I firmly believe that the email sent is real, but it is nothing more than a spam email sent by a fanatic. That&#39;s just what I gathered after quick research. </p>

<p>So no, it is not &quot;Project Blue Beam&quot;, you cognitively biased goofs.</p>

<p>Hello, ET.  Thank you for joining us Earthlings here on Reddit.  I hope you enjoy the conversation.</p>

<p>Yes, because obviously making arbitrary decisions about what other species are and are not permitted to do, clearly makes you so much more enlightened than us.  Also, if you really were that much more advanced, our technology would not be a threat to you at all.  It&#39;s not even as though what we have (that is publically acknowledged, at least) is all that advanced, anywayz; the corporate world has done its&#39; level best to keep us chained to the 1950s ever since that decade ended.  Failbook doesn&#39;t count as Utopian in my mind.</p>

<p>Granted, many of us <strong><em>are</em></strong> malevolent war-like beings; but we also have porn.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2016/04/08/the-long-strange-history-of-john-podestas-space-alien-obsession/">https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2016/04/08/the-long-strange-history-of-john-podestas-space-alien-obsession/</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>Agreed on that point, but I&#39;m not the happiest with the quality of this post either. Wikileaks is invoked to give this story currency, but there&#39;s not an ounce of new substance, just some old ufologists cold calling on a presidential adviser and apparently receiving no response.</p>

<p>This is John Podesta&#39;s public gmail address. Literally anyone can send him a email on here. The former astronaut referenced is well known for espousing this kind of belief. The &quot;Terry&quot; guy who actually sent the email has a website up that talks about all this exact stuff. None of the claims are new and the fact that he sent them in an email to someone important is not news. If their stuff has merit, we should be addressing it based on that, not based on the false airs of legitimacy something has for showing up with the name wikileaks on it.</p>

<p>As long as there is big oil, military industrial complex and evil secret societies etc... technologies like zero point energy (this kind of tech has been know for a LONG time) will never be available to everyone, unless humanity as a whole says ENOUGH we don&#39;t want to live in a world like this anymore or is forced to a braking point when it already be too late !</p>

<li>A transnational shadow government mostly made up of corporate big wigs have been secretly developing space faring tech and crafts AND mining.</li>
<li>Some government employees have been in on it but they treat their government counterparts and even more senior officials with disdain because they are not privy to the secret space program knowledge. Most of these I guess act like spies, and act to circumvent disclosure because those in control of the secret space program have gotten out of control.</li>
<li>Those in government that have been made aware have wanted to out the truth, but they could not. See Obama on Jimmy Kimmel, everyone said he was joking but Obama was not smiling, &quot;That&#39;s what we&#39;re instructed to say. </li>
<li>Before those in the governments (all around the world) found out through trusted sources that the secret space program exists, they would deny it&#39;s existence. They were merely perpetuating info suppression so as not to embarrass those government officials who were on record in the past as denying the existence of ETs as well as to maintain the integrity of the government as a whole.</li>
</ol>

<p>This is a highly complex issue, with many many different motives, agendas and justifications, so there really is no one single angle.</p>

<p>However I will say, that &quot;leaders&quot; are controlled, while manahers do their bidding. It&#39;s just like a bureaucratic heirarchy, where each level of mamager or director is compartmentalized, so one truly knows what&#39;s happening at the top.

<p>There is some AI software that would be able to take care of commenting and voting on forums, like running a script, but I sure as heck do not think a trillionaire is spending his time downvoting a redditor - haha! He is probably at least a dozen levels removed from this type of task.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No.  I can tell you very succinctly what my most fundamental reason is, for not believing in the legitimacy of Assange.</p>

<p>It&#39;s the fact that he is still breathing.</p>

<p>Most people, even those in this subreddit who spend their time going through the American government&#39;s dirty laundry, are not aware of just how truly, completely, and relentlessly psychopathic the American intelligence community really is.  <strong><em>No one</em></strong> lives, who they want to die.  If they truly wanted Assange, Snowden, Manning, or whoever else dead, then said people would be.</p>

<p>So the fact that Assange and Snowden are both not only still alive, but are able to do their work, says to me that the NSA want it that way; because again, if that wasn&#39;t what the NSA wanted, then that is not what would happen.  We are talking about people who are utterly devoid of what we know as human feeling, and who do not care who or how many people they need to kill, in order to preserve themselves.  </p>

<p>Anyone who thinks that either Assange or Snowden are capable of evading them, does not know what they are capable of.  It&#39;s that simple.</p>

<p>Think about all thr government people that discover they are in a senior position of the CIA or the NSA, and that they discover they do not have a need to know about the secret space program. if they are of positive polarity, how do you think they will react? S/he would be pissed off! They would want to mobilize whatever forces of people for good to fight against the negative transnational forces that have been repressing humanity and sucking on our teet.</p>

<p>Our reality believe it or not is dependent on co-creative consciousness, so as more information comes out, it will be very important for people to learn that the truth has been hidden for some 1000s of years, and they will need to be introduced to the idea that we can demand what we want.</p>

<p>Up until I discovered David Wilcock years ago, it was mere speculation. Even David&#39;s assertions seemed to be conjecture. However, one of the smart things David Wilcock did was to hold onto certain claims by his original &quot;insiders&quot; and sources, did not tell anyone, which he then used to validate stories and cross reference with arguably his most important source/insider/whistleblower to date. </p>

<p>A couple of years ago, David Wilcock started interviewing Corey Goode, basically an interpreter for the Secret Space Program, who then becomes an important ambassador, and an encouraged whistleblower.</p>

<p>Anyway, here&#39;s <a href="http://spherebeingalliance.com/blog/day/20150923.html">one mention</a> in their interviews. I believe there are a couple of other mentions you can find. The best place to discover WAY more information is News &gt; <a href="http://www.spherebeingalliance.com/blog/short/3.html?page=70">Cosmic Disclosure</a>. You can read the transcripts of all interviews, which are actually locked down on the video host website Gaia, for profit.</p>

<p>His motive for telling his story is tied to karma. He was involved with some bad people in his past, so he&#39;s trying to right his wrongs. Apparently, on a spiritual/soul level, karma is real and this is also confirmed in The Law of One.</p>

<li>A transnational shadow government mostly made up of corporate big wigs have been secretly developing space faring tech and crafts AND mining.</li>
<li>Some government employees have been in on it but they treat their government counterparts and even more senior officials with disdain because they are not privy to the secret space program knowledge. Most of these I guess act like spies, and act to circumvent disclosure because those in control of the secret space program have gotten out of control.</li>
<li>Those in government that have been made aware have wanted to out the truth, but they could not. See Obama on Jimmy Kimmel, everyone said he was joking but Obama was not smiling, &quot;That&#39;s what we&#39;re instructed to say. </li>
<li>Before those in the governments (all around the world) found out through trusted sources that the secret space program exists, they would deny it&#39;s existence. They were merely perpetuating info suppression so as not to embarrass those government officials who were on record in the past as denying the existence of ETs as well as to maintain the integrity of the government as a whole.</li>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh there will be a lot more! When I saw the Podesta post at the bottom of the first page, I was like holy shiiiite, wasn&#39;t expecting that. I&#39;ve known Podesta has been a big proponent for disclosure since the National Press Conference appearance, so I immediately started searching the wikileaks-podesta DB for ET related keywords.
(edit - I say alot more, because that was only 2,000 of a batch of 50,000 emails. I suppose we&#39;re looking down the barrel of at the very least soft / partial disclosure.)</p>
