<p>Are any of you are aware that Russia just said yesterday for the first time that they would shoot down US planes (flying over Syria) basically putting us on a direct war footing with them now and if any of it concerns any of you and has any impact on your feelings about candidates?</p>

<p>Not to break up the Trump mauling here but I am just wondering if any of you are aware that Russia just said yesterday for the first time I can remember since the 1960&#39;s that they would shoot down US planes (flying over Syria) basically putting us on a direct war footing with them now and if any of it concerns any of you and has any impact on your feelings about candidates?</p>

<p>I would honestly just like to know because no one is even talking about it.</p>

<p>Here is the announcement by Russia with specific warnings about how stealth aircraft wont matter and the anti aircraftmissles will have larger damage radius than expected (nukes i think)  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oc_QLc7PSF8">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oc_QLc7PSF8</a></p>

<p>This follows a long history of public pleas by Putin to please deescalate and stop threatening his borders at ukraine and other places and stop expanding NATO to his doorstep so he has to respond. He has specifically said for a few years now that USA NATO expansion it is creating an extremely dangerous situation and the victoria neulands of the world keep pushing and our state department threatened his cites and his personnel last month and then putins personal chaffuer of 20 years is killed in putins car in which Putin could have been riding (putins chaffuer drove around even when putin wanst in so no one knew where putin was so putin could habe been expected to be in that smashed car)  and we support isis to try to overthrow russias last middle east ally syria decreseing Russias border buffer further and prompting russia to dirwclty engsge our allies in amilitary stuggle for tue firsttime since afghanistan and russia repeatedly stated last year that it looked like everyone was gearing up for world war 3 and now democrats are claiming russia is trying to hurt us elections and that russia leaders should be tried for war crimes.</p>

<p>Of course I beleive this censorship is because it makes america realize that Hillary&#39;s missteps in Syria may cause the usa to go to war with russia and that she is highly dangerous.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What makes you think he would team up with Putin? Even if he wanted to I see no way that would happen since Trump is just one man. One man wont be able to stop the hundreds within our government that seem to want war with Russia over Syria. He might though be able to negotiate some kind of peaceful resolution to the Syria thing.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>He likes Putin, and he hates both the EU and NATO (as does Putin). His peaceful resolution to Syria, may end up only being peaceful for Syria.</p>

<p>Not that Clinton is much better, it&#39;s just she&#39;s doing it in reverse. Pick a side America, what type of villain do you prefer: pantomime or James Bond? If Trump had a moustache it would be twirling (the wig seems to be doing the job though), Clinton is probably sitting somewhere stroking a white cat right now (insert joke about Bill here).</p>

<p>With his utter lack of disclosure, I feel like there&#39;s near certainty he has investments in Russia and that is the primary reason he will not disclose his financials. They&#39;ve been keeping his shitty real estate empire afloat all these years.</p>

I understand there is much more at play here in terms of their economy, but we need to understand where their position is here.

<p>I also read tonight that ballistic missile systems are shielded from nuclear blasts, that&#39;s equally as scary.</p>
