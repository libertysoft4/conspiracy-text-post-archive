<p>So .. to my question. I honestly love reading up on conspiracies, watching videos about them, talking about them as a hobby. I don&#39;t even need to believe in their validity to enjoy them, I just do. </p>

<p>Whenever I bring this up - people look at me like I&#39;m insane and say things like &quot;Oh God, don&#39;t tell me you believe 9/11 was an inside job&quot; or something. I usually just laugh it off and tell them the honest truth &quot;They are so fun!!!&quot; and don&#39;t push it. </p>

<p>Why does it bother people so much? How do you deal with these sorts of folks. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>While this is true, very few people totally trust the media.  The ideas of independently minded individuals are respected above all.</p>

<p>Rather than &quot;believing in conspiracies,&quot; just talk about whichever beliefs you have the most personal evidence for believing in.  I find that most people are enthralled by a truly rational deconstruction of events.</p>

<p>You also shouldn&#39;t be 100% certain about almost any conspiracy theory.  Unless you are a direct witness, you are relying on second-hand evidence, which could always be bogus. </p>

<p>For a few reasons. First, for them to accept the conspiracy theory would mean that what they believe is wrong. - and people <strong>hate to be told they are wrong - about anything</strong>! Second people want <em>corroboration</em> - not truth.  Third, people think of the government as their parent, so for them to accept the conspiracy theory would mean that you are insulting their family. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I had to straight up stop talking about anything related to politics, economics, social events, etc with one of my friends because he won&#39;t listen to what I have to say. He already thinks I&#39;m a &#39;nut&#39; because I tried taking to him about 9/11. Now, no matter what I&#39;m saying, he disagrees or tries to justify it because in a conspiracy theorist. He can&#39;t even define conspiracy, though most people can&#39;t. It&#39;s driven me so nuts, I stopped talking to him about anything related to conspiracies.</p>

<p>Funny thing is, from time to time he&#39;ll bring up something trump says or BLM did, and I won&#39;t say a word. If I did, I&#39;d often agree with what he&#39;s said but I&#39;d rather he get the info on his own since it doesn&#39;t come with the connotation of being linked to a conspiracy theorist. Also, him seeing that I&#39;m right about a lot of shit I&#39;ve tried talking to him about has been so awesome. Feelsgoodman.jpg</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Remember that essay you had to write about hellen keller&#39;s optimism?  Or about abraham lincoln&#39;s fight for black equality?  Or any of the hundreds of homework assignments you never wanted to work on, but had to, or else you were deprived of your life, liberty, happiness, childhood, rights, extra dessert, allowance, tv privileges, phone privileges, etc? Or worse yet, shamed in front of your peers and put into outgroup?</p>

<p>What if I told you those things you were forced to do were all lies?  Lies upon lies of the sinistermost?  </p>

<p>Yep, that&#39;s why people don&#39;t go there.  Because it&#39;s <em>too hard psychologically to realize that they&#39;ve wasted their limited time on earth participating in the consumption and active participation of illusion</em>.  </p>

<p>The way to lead them to the truth is to make them face facts.  I would send them the link to confirmed conspiracies.  If you send them factual, verified info and they still refute it, I suggest you cut off communication immediately because you can&#39;t trust that they won&#39;t betray you also, if they can&#39;t accept simple facts.  It means they have a characterological problem that can&#39;t be resolved by anyone but themselves, by their own effort to &quot;clean their relationship with truth up with themselves&quot; and reclaim their integrity.</p>

<p>Those are conspiracies that governments have confessed and owned up to.  If someone ever says to you conspiracies don&#39;t happen or people can&#39;t keep secrets, then point them to manhattan project or safari club.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That does suck man.  I have to admit that I lost a <del>good</del> shitty friend from talking conspiracy stuff but that was his choice.  It hurt my feelings.  I gave him a book from ae911truth (pamphlet really) called &#39;beyond misinformation&#39;.  Everything in it is scientifically factual.  He argued science with me because he worships science.  Now keep in mind, I&#39;ve been to an engineering school and through an engineering program and I know science to a degree; he had a 2 yrs associates degree in art.  He was arguing stuff that made no sense and even using a person who wasnt even there (straw man) to support his arguments while I&#39;m talking about the law of conservation of energy and the 2nd law of thermodynamics which is lost on him.  </p>

<p>I tried to appeal to his critical thinking skills.  (you know that huge bonfire we had?  Remember how it was cold in the morning?... What if you had a bonfire and it was still 2500F after 4 months, wouldn&#39;t you think there&#39;s something else keeping it hot during that time...where&#39;s that extra energy come from?)</p>

<p>So basically he cut off communications.  Initially I felt terrible about this.  Now I realize that he did the right thing.   When we have justice, all these people are going to confess their treason to us one way or another</p>

<p>that&#39;s because it makes them feel bad to imagine or think about, so they don&#39;t want to think about it, because the vast majority of people only care about feeling good and making themselves feel good about themselves using everything in their daily lives -- thinking about &quot;omg conspiracies&quot; doesn&#39;t make them feel good about themselves because they&#39;ve been taught that it&#39;s embarrassing or stupid to believe anything aside from what Dear Leaders tell them, so they don&#39;t want to think about it, because it doesn&#39;t make them feel good about themselves.</p>

<p>Even if they consider the ideas and decide they&#39;re true, the conspiracies still make them feel bad about themselves because it makes them feel powerless and duped.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>People don&#39;t like to be wrong. That&#39;s what I&#39;ve learned from talking to people and on here. People <strong>HATE</strong> being wrong.</p>

<p>Their whole lives, most people have been told what to believe from their parents, their church, and their TV. When you say anything that contradicts any information they got from those 3 sources, they think you&#39;re crazy. Sometimes people have never heard of an argument that goes against theirs. Sometimes people hold their world view so tightly that they will willfully ignore any evidence that contradicts their beliefs.</p>

<p>At the end of the day, more people yearn more to be happy and feel better about themselves than to know the truth about the world. You see it on this sub all the time. Follow me around on here and you&#39;ll see what I&#39;m talking about.</p>

<p>I love to challenge people&#39;s religious views. Whether you be Christian, Jewish, Muslim, Buddhist, whatever, idc I&#39;ll challenge you. I do this because most people have never critically examined their beliefs. They grow up with their parents and their church (or mosque or temple or w/e) telling them the &quot;truth&quot; that was ascertained from a book that was written by humans with absolutely no evidence of the divine. My favorite question for Christians is &quot;Do you have proof God exists?&quot; It&#39;s such a simple question and yet it has never ever ever been fulfilled. Once they realize they have no proof, they go through cognitive dissonance trying to rationalize why they believe but it&#39;s usually dependent on many logical fallacies.</p>

<p>Ex: how do we know God exists? The Bible says so. How do we know the Bible is right? God says so. That&#39;s circular logic out the ass and it doesn&#39;t prove anything. I could use the same logic to prove dragons are real using Harry Potter or Eragon.</p>

<p>Tl;dr- people don&#39;t like being wrong</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There&#39;s a few reasons. </p>

<p>Media has consistently portrayed conspiracy theorists as tinfoil wearing idiots with paranoid schizophrenia. Decades of characters like this have created a major stereotype.</p>

<p>The other reason is because some theorists are ridiculous and over the top. They used biased sources, act like they have found esoteric truth and think everyone else is a &quot;sheep&quot;.</p>

<p>Use solid, credible evidence, don&#39;t get attacking and stay reasonable and people are likely to listen.</p>

<p>yeah it always changes, this will end up going the exact same way that black rights / slavery abolitionism / gay rights ended up going.</p>

<p>first it started with being dismissed and cursed, and anyone who supported it could get themselves literally lynched by the mob, then more and more people talk about it and people start realizing &#39;oh.. wait..&#39;, then suddenly it becomes the norm and blacks stop being slaves, and gays stop being killed (for the most part), because people eventually realize that they were being stupid before.</p>

<p>People don&#39;t make a decision to be like this - they have to make a decision to <em>not</em> be like this. What does that mean? Evolution forced the brain to look for leaders who will help the tribe survive. Those who did not follow orders generally found themselves in the wilderness alone, dying hungry.</p>

<p>But now, the world is connected, and our survival is no longer hinged on the collective efforts of a small hunting group. Evolution has not yet caught up to this massive change, so our brains are still looking for that leader; that person who can keep us safe and direct us to prosperity. This person often becomes the president, or the nightly news anchor, or some other trusted authoritative figure.</p>

<p>The people who look up to those figures, listen to what they say, and act accordingly, truly have no idea how their primal motives have been twisted. They are putting their full trust into a person they <strong>have never met</strong>. Previously, that person was a caring, loving leader, with whom you could interact and share joys with. Now, that person is a bobbling head on a screen. Yet, MANIACALLY, the same type of trust is devoted.</p>

<p>There&#39;s a very real problem in governing 310+ million people as one. We no longer have that personal connection with our leaders, and as a result, they feel no empathy for screwing us over.</p>

<p>People are good. They want to be happy, survive, and stay safe. But all too often, they&#39;re also too fucking stupid to take a step back and think about the chaos that&#39;s unfolded around them and realize where it&#39;s all gone wrong.</p>

<p>Pay close attention to TV (or, do yourself a favor, and ignore it at all costs). For quite some time now, the term &quot;conspiracy theorist&quot; is tossed around primetime TV quite frequently. Although the described character may appear rather crazy to the average person, they also tend to be right. This allows people to easily associate conspiracy theories with fiction, despite the fact that the <em>theorists are right</em>. Even more recently, commercials are now starting to pop up in hopes of mocking conspiracy theorists.</p>

<p>Remember when I said people are social creatures? There aren&#39;t a whole lot of things more frightening to a social creature than being laughed at by their peers. By watching shows where such a person is also ostracized, it builds a barrier in their brain that prevents them from exploring the truth.</p>

<p>Nowadays, I have no qualms in speaking about conspiracy theories, mainly because so many of them HAVE turned out to be true. A person&#39;s first reaction is to laugh when listening to one, and that&#39;s fine with me. All you have to do is ask why they&#39;re laughing, and if you can get them to realize they have no good reason, you might have a chance.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>They are absolutely, blissfully unaware of the fact that they are actively lying to themselves. These people are the most close-minded folks I&#39;ve ever encountered -- especially people from my own generation that were brought up on the religion of mainstream media. To even question their veracity is to question their God, and in their eyes you belong in an institution that can &quot;re-educate&quot; you on the values of our culture -- the most important being BLIND ACCEPTANCE. They are unaware because everytime they encounter some truth, they experience a very emotionally disturbing sensation called cognitive dissonance, where an idea goes against your current paradigm so strongly, that to entertain it threatens your emotional stability. That is the crux of this, to question certain things would make these idiots have to re-evaluate everything they think they know to be true, and they are certainly not willing to do that.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;d merely suggest your arguments have to be metered - not frantically spitting out a bunch of facts - because even if your facts are accurate, you will <em>seem crazy</em>. </p>

<p>I just push the issue a little bit with a statement, some facts, a timeline and maybe a name or two, and luckily my friends will agree for the most part. I wouldn&#39;t spout this stuff off to a stranger or coworkers. (If at all, it would be about 10% of what I&#39;m thinking.)</p>

<p>The other thing I&#39;ll point out is we don&#39;t want to come across as a preacher, i.e. you need to believe what I believe, as that leaves a bad taste in everyone&#39;s mouth.</p>

<p>Having this knowledge and approach on news though definitely has always given me a sense that I know more about the truth and our reality than most.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not looking to ruffle feathers, but this is my opinion. It&#39;s because most conspiracy theorists have been driven underground and the ones who stayed above ground are the loudest and often dumbest representations of conspiracy theories. </p>

<p>Don&#39;t get me wrong, I like Alex Jones and will listen to him sometimes. It doesn&#39;t mean I agree, but I listen. But there are times when he rants and raves and literally froths at the mouth where it can&#39;t be avoided that he is how many people view conspiracy theorists.</p>

<p>Not many people know I&#39;m a &quot;conspiracy&quot; guy. Some friends know it, but they know me as a person and can&#39;t simply paint me with the brush of &quot;oh, he&#39;s a tinfoil hatter.&quot; </p>

<p>And for people I&#39;m introducing to conspiracy stuff, I&#39;ll try and give them examples that appeal to their personal politics. Like if it&#39;s an environmental type, I&#39;ll say something about how the asbestos industry conspired to keep information contained that asbestos caused cancer and provide specific citations.</p>

<p>Or if it&#39;s a black civil rights person, I&#39;ll tell them about the Tuskegee Syphilis thing where the US purposefully experimented on unwitting black men. </p>

<p>You get the idea. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t go straight into how I believe the JFK assassination was a CIA/Mafia conspiracy or how US foreign policy&#39;s primary purpose is to foment perpetual war through destabilization. That stuff often times is too much for the uninitiated to handle and scares people off.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Here is my take (obviously propaganda is a factor).</p>

<p>Lots of people suck at logic. Some people prefer inductive logic; some prefer deductive. In fact, this divide is roughly 50/50 in humans and different people lean on logic (as opposed to feelings, sensing, etc.) to various degree. At least this is the hypothesis behind the MBTI.</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inductive_reasoning#/media/File:Argument_terminology_used_in_logic.png">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inductive_reasoning#/media/File:Argument_terminology_used_in_logic.png</a></p>

<p>Deductive logic is used by mathematicians, philosophers, etc. They strongly prefer to deal with proven facts, valid data, axioms, theorems, published and reviewed research. Conspiracy theories are far too messy, too unlikely for them to even consider them in the first place. They gravitate toward certainty and that requires being very conservative in terms of what you hold as true. In fact some of these people will tell you that they hold nothing as true. A weird existence, eh?</p>

<p>On the other hand, people who prefer inductive logic - that seems natural. They like absorbing data and them forming (sometimes premature) conclusions. It works pretty well in the real world for the real world is messy.</p>

<p>When you talk to the people who prefer the deductive logic, you better start off with things that are very easy to demonstrate.</p>

<p>There are billions of stupid people on this planet and many of them believe in stupid shit. Humans used to believe in a lot of BS superstitions. They do not work. Science &amp; scientific method have been great for humanity, although scientists are human and corruptible so lots of peer-reviewed research today is total shit.</p>

<p>However, it is overall still much better than drinking diluted onion water to fight cancer.</p>

<p>The take-away is - be ready to talk about the most obvious &amp; documented conspiracies like &quot;they are killing babies in incubators&quot;.</p>

<h1>We need a list of conspiracy theories sorted by how credible they are!</h1>

<p>I do not know how to establish such metric. Starting with the top of the list would do us much good. Otherwise, we will get laughed at. Like this:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g9VjNHayNfU">Hundreds Of Reindeer Killed By Lightning Strike</a></p>

<p>I hate Cenk for his lack of intellectual integrity, but he has a point. You need to be able to talk to people like him. Know your shit! Serve the best conspiracies first.</p>

<p>it makes them feel stupid, so they react to it as if they think it&#39;s stupid in an attempt to avoid feeling stupid themselves. it&#39;s the result of lifelong brainwashing. People let other people do their thinking for them because they want to <em>feel</em> like they&#39;re fitting in, so if you say something that doesn&#39;t fit in, it either means a. they&#39;re wrong, or b. you&#39;re wrong, so obviously they&#39;re going to pick option B in their imaginations so that they can keep feeling intelligent.</p>

<p>it&#39;s for the same reason that a religious fundamentalist will react with total disdain and dismissal to someone who doesn&#39;t believe in their religion, they&#39;ve been brainwashed to believe they&#39;re being good/intelligent/moral by being a muslim or christian or jewish fundamentalist, so that&#39;s what they believe, it has nothing to do with &quot;facts&quot;, it has to do with feelings and beliefs, so they have to dismiss anyone outside their belief system in order to keep feeling good/intelligent/moral.</p>
