    <div class="md"><p>Anything&#39;s possible. But I personally feel like everything Clinton is suspected of doing is pretty much par for the course as far as politicians go, especially at that level of power and influence. Hard to disrupt the masses with more of the same thing.</p>

<p>And I&#39;m not saying any of it is excusable, nor should it be acceptable, but Trump can&#39;t go 72 hours without saying something abhorrently inflammatory. Even if our traditional view of &quot;acting Presidential&quot; is based on decades of bullshit, it&#39;s still comforting to most Americans that a candidate&#39;s public stance isn&#39;t filled with off-the-cuff ignorance and vitriol.</p>

<p>Does the entire system need a complete overhaul? Abso-fucking-lutely.</p>

<p>But do you think that whatever the fuck Trump is doing is really going to bring about real change? And if so, at what cost?</p>

<p>I think he&#39;s probably the reality of what many politicians truly are when they&#39;re not in character; think the Luther/Obama skit from Key n Peele. The only difference is that he&#39;s never had to answer to anyone, ever- which includes us, the American people.</p>

<p>And I just don&#39;t see him changing his blatant disregard for other humans this late in the game.</p>

<p>Sorry for the wall of text.</p>

<p>EDIT:  Yes, I know what Correct The Record is, and there probably are people being paid to post pro-Clinton things online. But calling someone names because you don&#39;t agree with their perspective seems a bit childish.</p>

<p>If you add .COM to my username, you can easily find out who I am. And it&#39;s definitely not a &quot;paid shill&quot;.</p>

<p>Also, thank you to <a href="/u/pmmckee">/u/pmmckee</a> for my first gold. I have no idea how it works, but it looks cool. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>He&#39;s only different because we haven&#39;t seen a straight up bigoted racist get so far in society in a long time and it&#39;s brought all the others of his ilk out of their holes. When Trump supporters mention being oppressed by others it is because a majority of the population doesn&#39;t want to be lead by a person like this. And they abhor the idea of someone propping up this kind of figurehead. They remember their history and what someone like this can do to a country. Maybe we want to stay on the same road because it is familiar and we understand how to navigate it. With someone like Trump at the helm, we&#39;d basically be lost in the woods as he has no moral or idealistic compass. He can only lead us down a dark path and when we all find ourselves lost and alone, he would abandon us and blame his rivals for leading us astray. That is not a president, that is a charlatan, unfortunately for some people, they can&#39;t tell the difference. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The only reason i give trump my time of day is because he has held true on trade deals, specifically the upcoming TPP. i have strong feeling that&#39;s why the dems snaked bernie out of the nomination, he was against the TPP also. Hillary blatantly flip flopped on the matter for the sole reason to get votes. </p>

<p>I think the only reason hillary is really running is to make sure the TPP goes through from obamas hands. Trump and bernie have been dead against it  and therefor have been on the losing side to the presidency. </p>

<p>Big money is behind the TPP and because of that hillary is probably going to win. She will see the deal go through with a smile on her face, yet another flip flop of a policy. </p>

<p>If the dems were serious about anything else other than the TPP then they would have welcomed bernie to be the nominee. </p>

<p>This, and maybe the anti islamification of the western culture is my only two reasons trump would have been the better candidate. His crass characteristics dont mean anything much to me in comparison. </p>

<p>Its a shame the majority of the voting population dont realize how many horrible policies hillary has been behind in the middle east which resulted in the death and displacement of millions of innocent muslims. Trump has not gone any where near the evil that hillary has carried out. </p>

Initially I supported Bernie Sanders and then Gary Johnson, I even donated $125 to him but I stopped supporting Gary Johnson when he said he would sign the TPP and Bill Weld kept talking about how great Clinton is.

He became an enabler of racists, sexists, and white nationalists.</p>

<p>In comparison to Hillary, Trump has all of her neoliberal negatives in terms of foreign and domestic policy, combined with a truly bizarre set of quirks/flaws and a sheer lack of knowledge that would be extremely damaging for the world.</p>

<p>Make sure you watch the documentary called Clinton Cash, which details the corruption of the clintons - and it is apropos given the haiti suffering from the hurricane -- as in the doc, they talk about the clintons profiting off haiti&#39;s eathquake in 2010</p>

<p>At the same time the DNC was rigging their own primaries against Bernie Sanders they were were also getting the MSM to give Trump extra airtime and tell their viewers to take him seriously. <a href="https://twitter.com/wikileaks/status/784908158426869761">https://twitter.com/wikileaks/status/784908158426869761</a></p>

<p>Morning Joe also stopped telling their viewers that the DNC was rigged after DWS and Luis Miranda told Chuck Todd and Phil Griffin (president of MSNBC) to stop. <a href="https://www.wikileaks.com/dnc-emails/emailid/13718">https://www.wikileaks.com/dnc-emails/emailid/13718</a></p>

<p>We also know from James Comey that Hillary lied to voters about her email server. And we know from Robert Reich that Hillary will support the TPP.</p>

<p>So while Trump may have shit for policy, the DNC cheated their own party by not telling them the truth or holding Hillary accountable, and they propped up the opponent they want us to vote against. That is political extortion.</p>

<p><strong>tl;dr: I will vote Trump unless Hillary and Kaine drop out, and if you vote for them you don&#39;t give a shit about our democracy or the power of the people.</strong></p>

<p>Trump is the most absurd acting presidential candidate I&#39;ve seen in my lifetime. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>I agree Hillary is a much better actor than Trump, but that&#39;s because he behaves honestly while Hillary behaves the way she thinks the public wants to see.  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>It&#39;s a weird election this year and conspiracy wants to bandwagon things so the culture permeates on random variabilities in things such as up votes. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Now you&#39;re just trying to sound smarter than you really are.  Your statement here is just plain nonsense. If you want to see a culture that permeates on random variabilities visit <del>r/HillaryforPOTUS</del> r/politics and see how they circle jerk on non presidential issues such as Trump&#39;s reality TV show.  See how the Hillary shills in that sub take to real issues such as glass steagal, embassy deaths due to her poor decision making, avoiding criminal charges, being in bed with big money, having Obama lie to protect her, etc...  </p>

<p>Now, I&#39;m not saying Trump is a great choice.  His economic policy resembles Reagan&#39;s trickle down policy and we know that doesn&#39;t work.  His life of being CEO, of being in charge, may have a negative impact when it comes to listening to advisers.   Most of all, many of his supporters are unreasonable, blowhard idiots filled with racist remarks.  Just visit r/theDonald.  I really don&#39;t want to empower his supporters with a Trump victory.  </p>

<p>Either way we&#39;re fucked.  Biggest problem in this country though isn&#39;t the presidential candidates.  It&#39;s the masse&#39;s dismissive attitude concerning their chosen party.  Then there&#39;s people like you that think they can say nothing, permeate nonsense while appearing articulate.  Please.  Enough of the bullshit already.  The Democrats and Republicans are both shit parties filled with corrupt people- they are of the same breed.  Keep ignoring this fact and we will get shit candidates every four years.</p>

<p>thanks.</p>

<p>Maybe he is referring to this?</p>

<p>“Obama Administration officials, including the Secretary of State, learned almost in real time that the attack in Benghazi was a terrorist attack. Rather than tell the American people the truth, the administration told one story privately and a different story publicly.”</p>

<p>Rep. Peter Roskam (IL-06) released the following statement regarding these findings:</p>

<p>“In the days and weeks after the attacks, the White House worked to pin all of the blame for their misleading and incorrect statements on officials within the intelligence community, but in reality, political operatives like Ben Rhodes and David Plouffe were spinning the false narrative and prepping Susan Rice for her interviews.” </p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you define &quot;actual charities not controlled by the Clintons&quot; as &quot;programmatic grants,&quot; then it appears the number is 15%, with 85% staying with the foundation itself:</p>

<p>Between 2009 and 2012, the Clinton Foundation raised over $500 million dollars according to a review of IRS documents by The Federalist (2012, 2011, 2010, 2009, 2008). A measly 15 percent of that, or $75 million, went towards programmatic grants. More than $25 million went to fund travel expenses. Nearly $110 million went toward employee salaries and benefits. And a whopping $290 million during that period — nearly 60 percent of all money raised — was classified merely as “other expenses.” ...The Clinton Foundation may well be saving lives, but it seems odd that the costs of so many life-saving activities would be classified by the organization itself as just random, miscellaneous expenses.</p>

<p>The Federalist responds to the PunditFact report in epic fashion (a must-read in full; an excerpt below)</p>

<p>PunditFact: A Case Study In Fact-Free Hackery</p>

<p>The problem here is not one of facts or accuracy, but ideology. Jacobson simply doesn’t like the implications of the fact that the Clinton Foundation spent less than 10 percent of its budgets on charitable grants in 2013. He doesn’t like the fact that the two single largest “charitable” initiatives of the Clinton Foundation — by its own admission — are the Clinton Presidential Library, which exists solely to put a positive spin on the 42nd president’s term in office, and the Clinton Global Initiative, which the New York Times characterized as a “glitzy annual gathering of chief executives, heads of state, and celebrities.” If hanging out with celebrities at glitzy dinners is the height of charity, then it’s time to beatify the Kardashian sisters.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, given talking about Clinton isn&#39;t remotely something I do often, I apologize if words somehow don&#39;t seem &quot;natural&quot; to you due to your confirmation bias. I&#39;m not by any means a fan of Hillary; I was Bernie all the way. But, that doesn&#39;t mean I demonize everyone else, and believe that lying about them is ok. The reality is The Clinton Foundation does put around 88% of the money they receive into charitable works. The 15% (ish) number that gets tossed around is what they give in grants to <em>other</em> organizations, not what they spend on charitable actions <em>total</em>.</p>

<p>Seriously: Pretty much all of the environmental work is funded by some public institutions.

    <div class="md"><p>It would make things assuredly tougher. Trump believes that environmental regulations limit private businesses, so he would try to reduce the requirements.

    <div class="md"><p>You underestimate the importance of large environmental firms. They pave the way for countless small businesses to compete for work they would otherwise be incapable of completing (some contracts require small women owned business involvement). They employ civil engineers, construction departments, etc.</p>

<p>It&#39;s not just environmental scientists. In fact, I would say environmental consulting firms incorporate more employees that aren&#39;t directly experienced in environmental work. </p>

<p>For instance, for some work on a navy installation, our contracting group hired a small company to complete almost the entirety of the work (often called pass through). The effects of reducing environmental compliance is far reaching, not even including the environmental base argument of saving the world.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Except for a handful of people???  Why didn&#39;t <em>they</em> vote for it?  Were they mistaken somehow?  Or did they know that Presidents (except Kennedy) are always lying us into wars?  </p>

<p>All Hillary does is lie.  As Secretary of State, all she did was covert arms dealing and operations in the Middle East - which Bush <em>had no part in</em>, including the Benghazi disaster - which she subsequently lied about.  </p>

<p>Yeah, Bush and others started it.  But that&#39;s a childish argument.  Obama likes to drone because he thinks it&#39;s intelligent and cool, not the cowboy way to do things.  He has done all sorts of covert things throughout Syria.  But he explains none of this to us.  He agreed to an arms deal with the Saudi&#39;s and is helping them bomb Yemen!  And Hillary is a warmonger that would make any neocon proud.  And he made her his Secretary of State.</p>

<p>And neocons are virtually en masse supporting Hillary.  Google it.  Ask yourself why (and give yourself an honest answer).  Now she&#39;s messing with Russia.  WHY???  Gotta have an enemy.  Gotta have a reason for imperial overreach.  She was on the Armed Services subcommittee from 2003-09.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not a fan of Bush or Trump, and Bush lied and made huge errors.  But to say that Hillary isn&#39;t a liar and warmonger is BS.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yep - and it makes sense. It&#39;s game theory. Clinton has been prepping for this moment for decades. She was thrown for a loop when Obama (who ran a transformative campaign, regardless of how you feel about his administration) beat her in 2008 and likely realized this was her last chance to become President and - given there was a weak field of candidates for the GOP and an increasingly divided electorate between alt-right, religious right, old school businesses guys, etc. - backed the weakest horse in that race. If I were a GOP voter I&#39;d be livid that the hustle worked so well.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know if Trump is working FOR Clinton. Likely he has his own aims (Trump News Network, IMO) but he didn&#39;t imagine he&#39;d be this successful. Now he has no choice but to run - which is why you hear that he offered Kasich the VP nod promising the responsibilities of President without the title.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>To be fair, there has been a lot said about his lack of plans and the infeasibility of the ones he does produce.  The problem is Trump knows he would get ripped to shreds if people argued against his lack of plans so he sees it as being less harmful to have people think he&#39;s an asshole than to think he&#39;s and idiot.  That is why he floods the media with this shit that he spews.  90% of the time it is him trying to distract from his lack of capability to actually run a country and would rather the conversation be about his imflammatory nature so that he can write it off as campaign mud slinging rather than actual political vetting. The other 10% of the time it is well timed shit posting by Clinton campaign or media that realizes he cannot be president.  </p>

<p>That&#39;s where trumps actually quite successful in this campaign, is his gamble on the asshole vs idiot dilemma.  He has built a solid base that actually likes that he is an asshole and anything he says will just further endear them to him.  The problem is, it&#39;s successful enough to win him the nomination but not enough to win the election.  Because the percentage of people who like that he&#39;s an asshole is like 25-30% then he gets another 15% who are party loyalists/&quot;Hillary is the devil&quot;ists and that&#39;s his ceiling.  The reason he can&#39;t go higher than that is because that gamble on the asshole vs idiot has back fired with the other 55-60% of us who ended up seeing him as not just one or the other, but as both an asshole and an idiot. The reason the election is close is because not all 55-60% that sees trump as unfit, is willing to vote for Hillary.</p>

<p>Sorry if any of that didn&#39;t make sense, I&#39;m half asleep and ranting.  Not necessarily trying to take a stance for one candidate or the other, even though it&#39;s probably clear.  I just wanted to make a point that people have tried to report on his lack of ability to run our country, but trump has successfully changed the conversation to something he sees as less harmful, with a little help from Clinton and the media.</p>

<p>FTFY.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know what to say to you; politics is a game of strategy. My thesis would be that the entire Democratic party - including the campaign team - is repelled by Trump. One new piece of information isn&#39;t going change much. But releasing it a week after you get it, to maximise the damage - that seems to me to be smart and perfectly ethical campaign management.</p>

<p>Plus, of course, it&#39;s only the most strenuous of speculation that i) the team has anything to do with it and ii) if they did, that they didn&#39;t release it at the earliest practical point.</p>

<p>&quot;Correct The Record (CTR) is one of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Brock">David Brock</a>&#39;s numerous Democratic Super PACs (see <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Media_Matters_for_America">Media Matters for America</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Bridge_21st_Century">American Bridge 21st</a> Century). <a href="http://correctrecord.org">CTR&#39;s</a> website describes itself as &quot;a strategic research and rapid response team designed to defend Hillary Clinton from baseless attacks.&quot; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/3pdivp/im_david_brock_former_member_of_the_vast/cw5e7eg">Brock himself stated that</a> &quot;CTR is a pro-Hillary SuperPAC. Part of our mandate is to do due diligence on Hillary’s opponents. Unlike the mud-slinging and name-calling we see on the Republican side, our research is all fact-based.&quot;  </p>

<p>CTR first gained attention (and hatred) on reddit (which is overwhelmingly pro-Bernie) with its <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/434wlh/sanders_is_furious_at_david_brock_hillarys_loyal/?">attacks on Sanders</a> throughout the Democratic primary campaign. Its popularity exploded three months ago when <a href="http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2016/04/21/hillary-pac-spends-1-million-to-correct-commenters-on-reddit-and-facebook.html">the Daily Beast reported that</a> CTR was spending $1m to &quot;push back against users on Twitter, Facebook, Reddit and Instagram through its <a href="http://correctrecord.org/barrier-breakers-2016-a-project-of-correct-the-record/">Barrier Breakers program</a>.  &quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Looks like they bumped that funding up a lot lately. I&#39;m surprised more reddit users aren&#39;t up in arms about this shit. You would also think the admins would have done something by now too, I guess they&#39;re letting their own politics get in the way of making the right decisions. </p>

<p>Millennials do not like Clinton, yet somehow on reddit the stupidest shit in support of her makes the front page everyday. This one of the largest instances of astroturfing I&#39;ve ever seen. </p>

<p>Your own damn post reads like something from CTR</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Do you have any rebuttal to the actual data presented? Perhaps to this part?</p>

<p>&quot;Clinton was one of the most liberal members during her time in the Senate. According to an analysis of roll call votes by Voteview, Clinton’s record was more liberal than 70 percent of Democrats in her final term in the Senate. She was more liberal than 85 percent of all members. Her 2008 rival in the Democratic presidential primary, Barack Obama, was nearby with a record more liberal than 82 percent of all members — he was not more liberal than Clinton.&quot;</p>

<p>Or is this the level of political discourse this sub expects?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Clinton is absolutely liberal. If you think Clinton is a conservative, you know literally nothing about politics. I&#39;m confused how you&#39;d even think she&#39;s remotely close to conservative? At best she&#39;s a moderate liberal. Please explain how she&#39;s conservative when all her stances lean left? Sanders was an extremist, Clinton is liberal. You must be knew to politics, which makes sense because this is probably the first election you&#39;ve paid attention to. It also solidifies how you&#39;ll believe anything, when almost all of those links have already been discredited by others. </p>

<p>But yes, it is time to &quot;assassinate your character&quot; (who the fuck says that?) because you&#39;re a wannabe edgelord who doesn&#39;t actually understand politics, but wants to support the candidate who is &quot;off-the-cuff.&quot; At any rate, Donald won&#39;t win or even come close, so there&#39;s nothing to truly worry about in the long run.</p>

<p>L O fucking L. I had to stop reading here.  Prove it. Prove they have been discredited when it is literally the CTR itself admitting to astro-turfing reddit. </p>

<p>Jesus fucking christ, how do you manage to breathe while being so fucking retarded?</p>

<p>You write like a fucking edgey 12 year old, pissed off at the world because your daddy beats you or some shit.  Go on, look at your own post history. Everyones an idiot but you right?</p>

<p>You know that saying &quot; If everyone you meet is an asshole, you&#39;re probably the asshole&quot;. Yea swap asshole with idiot and that&#39;s you bud. </p>

<p>How the fuck do you think clinton is even the slightest bit liberal? Honestly, I&#39;m dumbfounded here. Sanders was the only liberal in the election. You don&#39;t like him though so now he&#39;s an extremist right?  Atleast you CTR shills are consistent with character assassination. </p>

<p>Let me correct the record here. I&#39;m old enough to be your father, I&#39;ve probably voted in more elections than you&#39;ve been alive to see. And to cap it all off, you acting like a child who doesn&#39;t get his way is certainly not going to sway anyone to vote for hillary. </p>

<p>I&#39;ll let you get back to being beat by dad or whatever the fuck else is going on that&#39;s feeding your serious mental issue. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>lol. You&#39;re insulting Washington Times and OntheIssues? Oh boy. No wonder you follow the sources you do. You are so thick skulled it&#39;s borderline sad. I just gave you three major sources saying she&#39;s liberal and you&#39;re still denying it. Bernie sanders was a progressive socialist, and If you think he&#39;s the blueprint for &quot;liberal&quot; it explains everything. I&#39;m sorry dude, but I&#39;m gonna move on with my day. You obviously don&#39;t even <em>want</em> to understand how politics actually work, and I just need to respect that and let you vote how you please. Fortunately, <a href="/r/The_Donald">/r/The_Donald</a> and republican newspapers/forums are literally the only places saying that Trump has a chance, so it&#39;ll just be a few more months of election talk.</p>

<p>Clinton Emails on Libya Expose The Lie of ‘Humanitarian Intervention’</p>

<p><a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/dan-kovalik/clinton-emails-on-libya-e_b_9054182.html">http://www.huffingtonpost.com/dan-kovalik/clinton-emails-on-libya-e_b_9054182.html</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Probably the most revealing email is dated March 30, 2011, just 11 days into the NATO bombing campaign which would go on until October, 20, when Qaddafi was finally murdered (after being sodomized). <strong>In this email (C05782459), entitled “Win this War,” Clinton’s closest adviser, Sidney Blumenthal, makes it clear that, in terms of the continuing reasons for the war, any “humanitarian motive offered is limited, conditional and refers to a specific past situation.” In other words, while NATO would go on bombing for another 7 months, Blumenthal is already admitting that there is really no humanitarian basis for continuing the conflict.</strong></p>

<p>Exposing the Libyan Agenda: A Closer Look at Hillary Clinton&#39;s Emails</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Qaddafi&#39;s government holds 143 tons of gold, and a similar amount in silver.... This gold was accumulated prior to the current rebellion and was intended to be used to establish a pan-African currency based on the Libyan golden Dinar. This plan was designed to provide the Francophone African Countries with an alternative to the French franc (CFA). In a &quot;source comment,&quot; the original declassified email adds</strong>:</p>

<p><strong>Qaddafi&#39;s threatened attempt to establish an independent African currency was not taken lightly by Western interests. In 2011, Sarkozy reportedly called the Libyan leader a threat to the financial security of the world. How could this tiny country of six million people pose such a threat? First some background</strong>.</p>

<p>It is banks, not governments, that create most of the money in Western economies, as the Bank of England recently acknowledged. This has been going on for centuries, through the process called &quot;fractional reserve&quot; lending. Originally, the reserves were in gold.  In 1933, President Franklin Roosevelt replaced gold domestically with central bank-created reserves, but gold remained the reserve currency internationally.</p>

<p>In 1944, the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank were created in Bretton Woods, New Hampshire, to unify this bank-created money system globally. An IMF ruling said that no paper money could have gold backing. A money supply created privately as debt at interest requires a continual supply of debtors; and over the next half century, most developing countries wound up in debt to the IMF. The loans came with strings attached, including &quot;structural adjustment&quot; policies involving austerity measures and privatization of public assets.</p>

<p>After 1944, the US dollar traded interchangeably with gold as global reserve currency. When the US was no longer able to maintain the dollar&#39;s gold backing, in the 1970s it made a deal with OPEC to &quot;back&quot; the dollar with oil, creating the &quot;petro-dollar.&quot;  Oil would be sold only in US dollars, which would be deposited in Wall Street and other international banks.</p>

<p>You mean like the video of him talking about grabbing pussy from 199?  </p>

<p>The fact is, reddit is a mirror of the MSM.  The MSM, super pacs, and powerful groups are all colluding to dig up as much dirt about Trump as they possibly can.  </p>

<p>At the same time, all of hillary&#39;s dirt is turned a blind eye to, and the new dirt that continues to float to the surface, well, that&#39;s ignored as well.  </p>

<p>Can you imagine for one moment if the media came after Hillary the way they have come after Trump?  There is videos of hillary laughing about beating down a raped 12 year old girl and defending the sadistic rapist she knew was guilty, videos of her laughing about killing people, ordering deaths, and so much more scandalous information about her that is all being ignored.  </p>

<p>Can imagine if the media got a few checks written by the Clinton Foundation, like they did for Trump?  Or talked about the conflict of interest with her Foundation, like they have with Trump and his tax returns? </p>

<p>The playing field is not fate, Clinton&#39;s got her thumb on the scale, and we are witnessing another Bernie incidence.  This time it&#39;s Trump. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>As I mentioned in another reply, anything&#39;s possible. I wasn&#39;t posting to support Clinton, only to explain why people are probably more adamantly opposed to what Trump is doing/saying.</p>

<p>The majority of Americans already see our politicians as corrupt, so what Clinton has done isn&#39;t that far of a stretch from what her predecessors have done. E.g. Bush going to war based on what appeared to be lies in hindsight; Obama giving guns to Mexican cartels, and letting the NSA run wildly unchecked even though he ran on a platform of &quot;transparency&quot;.</p>

<p>I&#39;d like to think all politicians who commit these types of offenses would receive the same legal consequences as regular citizens.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, that&#39;s not how our society works.</p>

But the fact that your semi-apologetic post makes it to the top (and is guilded no less - why, I don&#39;t know) raises my suspicion that this is driven by shills. Also adding to my suspicions is that we know Clinton employs social propaganda techniques, and Reddit management is heavily supporting her. It is clear that Reddit has itself become a major propaganda tool.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The rational argument to counter this, is trump will do with america, exactly what he has done with trump industries. At the best cost he can negotiate. </p>

<p>Trump industries is a multinational corporation, that is solely ran by Trump&#39;s decision making. It has out lasted multiple decades of false and outright criminal trade deals, done working contracts with every nation on the planet, and has likely bailed out america itself, when we were in periods of financial ruin. 
That is what made the Trump name so Important. He is known for his experience, and ability to buy, trade, and sign when the time is right. Taking as few losses as possible, and sometimes coming back with very little to start over with. </p>

<p>You need to realize that for nearly 2 decades, the clinton obama bush regime bankrupted our nation, and accepted payments for our now cowering positions. Trading our honor and security for condos, and limo&#39;s. Cnn is paid off. That is a huge red flag...</p>

<p>If a News agency is openly committing fraud it goes on to show that america is on the verge of complete system failure. 
That is the effective position our nation is showing abroad. That we as a nation are so corrupt, our media itself is in full swing panic mode trying to &quot;Forcibly&quot; steer an election into &quot;choosing&quot; the Liar that will keep it all together. </p>

<p>We are built and now living on lies. Despicable ones, that those in charge will do anything to keep in the dark. 
Trump is the one thing showing the world right now how corrupt the world is. </p>

<p>He isn&#39;t making himself look like an ass. The media is. Because they themselves are corrupt. </p>

<p>That became obvious when obama repelled the media propaganda act in 2013. (to lie about the fukushima, and libya catastrophies). </p>

<p>ALSO AT FORUM. IT IS OBVIOUS PAID SHILL TOP COMMENTOR IS PAID SHILL BY 1000+KARMA AND GOLD FOR YET ANOTHER PRO HRC VIEW&gt; (HOWEVER). Any sane poster would notice that maybe only 200 people have actually seen this article. (hence every single comment karma being like 12).</p>

<p>I also think that Reddit is more of a centre left leaning website in terms of politics,especially during this election cycle. Maybe it would be more evenly balanced if the Republican candidate wasnt so far to the right. </p>

<p>Even if our traditional view of &quot;acting Presidential&quot; is based on decades of bullshit, it&#39;s still comforting to most Americans that a candidate&#39;s public stance isn&#39;t filled with off-the-cuff ignorance and vitriol.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Here&#39;s the thing. &quot;Acting presidential&quot; is a myth, one literally created by clinton&#39;s campagin team during the 1990s. Politicans are people, they say stupid shit, they do stupid shit. It&#39;s only with the advent of mass media invading every facet of our life that it suddenly becomes a big deal for someone to say something that every other american in the country has said at some point in time. </p>

<p>The president is not suppose to be a world leader, or a diplomat. He&#39;s not suppose to be some charismatic god-king that brings hope or change. He&#39;s not suppose to be someone who knows all or sees all or has all the answers. He&#39;s suppose to be the guy nobody likes. The guy that sits alone, reading legislation that the retards in congress have cobbled together and makes sure it doesn&#39;t become an actual law it if its too god damn stupid or blatantly against the country&#39;s best interests. The celebrity of the office is entirely artificial and frankly, it&#39;s unacceptable. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>A healthy off the books donation in Reddit Platinum™ certainly helps, for those moments when you need...whatever it is...to disappear altogether. At the end of the day I&#39;m here to distract myself, looking at cat pics and stuff, occasionally I&#39;ll hit paydirt for magical internet points, but by and large I venture 90% of everyone here is blowing off steam. </p>

<p>So McLuhan was right, but the BEST part about this particular medium, is you can <strong>unsubscribe</strong> from <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a> and join - or create your own forum. So I wonder what happens when the medium ignores them?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The Soviet Union learned early when it came to spys/moles you never pay them unless you are desperate. Its better if you develop spys who work for free because they support your ideology. They paid very few and only American or Europeans who where in extreme positions of importance would typically get paid.</p>

<p>I really doubt any mod is getting paid they are doing it because they are true believers. Never underestimate the ability of people to sell out their responsibility like modding a forum for no cash at all.</p>

<p>Just a 5 minute phone call from David Brock would get every single left wing mod to do what he wants and it can&#39;t be traced if no money changes hands.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>In a conventional sense, no. His main appeal to people up until a couple months ago was his unwillingness to fall into the conventional campaign model. </p>

<p>Initially he was calling out every political figure for what they were, money whores. He flat out said he could buy almost everyone who was running. He started steamrolling the primaries because people are tired of the BS and we&#39;re rallying around him. </p>

<p>It&#39;s only in the past few months that his handlers have gotten ahold of him and toned him down. It started happening when all the shake ups in his campaign started happening. I&#39;d be willing to bet a bunch of talking heads from the RNC established themselves within his circle and since then he&#39;s been floundering. </p>

<p>Going out there and hitting middle of the road talking points is something political legacies like HRC is great at, not Trump. He&#39;s allowed himself to be put on the defensive by pandering to the Republican Party and it&#39;s biting him in the ass. Instead of saying fuck you to all these people, he bent over for their endorsement and now their jumping ship to make him look week. He does much better as an antiestablishment candidate than one who tries to play the game. </p>

<p>Trump is awash in PC gaffes. There is no denying that. If he had half of the legal and sexual harassment issues HRC has floating around her there is no way he&#39;d still be running. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>McCain was the first real lesson that in modern media, whoever the Republican party nominates will be absolutely eaten up and shat out myriad times between the nomination and November.  it doesn&#39;t matter at all what they actually think or do.</p>

<p>McCain used to be <em>loved</em> the the mass media.  He would go on every show and talk to every reporter and they loved it, largely because he would criticize the Republican party leadership.  McCain was also the first guy to bring campaign finance reform to the national stage -- its still a huge issue.  But once he got nominated?  McCain became this too-old guy who was out-of-touch and probably a racist.    </p>

<p>Same thing happened to Romney.    In reality though both McCain and Romney were very respectable politicians -- esp. Romney, a republican who was governor of Blue state who overhauled health care for crying out loud! -- but it doesn&#39;t matter.  They were pilloried.  So the lesson is:  if you&#39;re a Republican, it doesn&#39;t really matter what you say or how you say it.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you  legitimately think that Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump are both equally bad people and would both  be equally awful presidents, then you can vote third party or not vote. But the argument of &#39;even if Hillary is pretty shitty, Donald Trump would be a million times worse&#39; is absolutely a valid argument to make. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The demographic for this site is 16-24 year old, pot smoking, unemployed, college debt crippled youth. This demographic overwhelmingly votes democrat, upwards of 90%+ of them, and so 90% of this site is people who will defend the left no matter what. It&#39;s very easy to think that a site as big as reddit represents a fairly normal piece of society, but it really doesn&#39;t. Most of the people here won&#39;t even be voting, tons of them aren&#39;t even American, and if you ask random strangers in real life if they use reddit 95% of the time they will say &quot;what the fuck is a reddit?&quot; Don&#39;t forget statistics and demographics when reading the sewage that is reddit, in no way does this site represent reality at all.</p>

<p>ONLY a 37 point margin last election among this age group, and that accounts for all youth in the nation - people who habitually use sites like reddit are much more likely to be left leaning than right leaning, as the trend goes for pretty much everywhere on the internet. People who constantly consume social media are more likely to be liberal, and liberals are more likely to constantly consume social media. Did I pull 90% out of my ass? Yeah, absolutely, but the number is much higher than 70%, which is verifiable, we can call it 80% and meet in the middle if it makes you feel better.</p>

<p>Or do you mean the 95%? 
<a href="http://www.pewinternet.org/files/old-media/Files/Reports/2013/PIP_reddit_usage_2013.pdf">http://www.pewinternet.org/files/old-media/Files/Reports/2013/PIP_reddit_usage_2013.pdf</a></p>

<p>6% of people surveyed had ever used reddit at all. That means 94% of people have never used reddit in their lives. And, actually, this survey was conducted on internet users already, so that number is much lower when you account for all the people who do not regularly user the internet (regularly being for hours a day). </p>

<p>If you think this cancer website reflects anything close to reality, well, you are a fool, not much more to say. It is a very, very, very niche group of people.</p>

She has fine control over the DNC but was able to get one over on the entire RNC, by getting her buddy Donald to run, and see just how far the collective GOP knuckledragging exercise goes. We see today as Senators and bloggers alike run for political cover from Mr. Trump&#39;s latest escapade.</p>

<p>Only now, a few scant days from the eve of the election, is it beginning to dawn on the GOP , that they were outmaneuvered, in that way, such that I am kind of reminded from that scene from Game of Thrones, when the smartest woman in the Great Sept realizes they need to leave, and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LfIpW6f0l8">by then it&#39;s far too late</a>, perhaps that&#39;s what makes that show so engrossing, because it&#39;s&#39; disturbingly relevant sometimes.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>treating him like shit is one thing. its &#39;modern&#39; politics and ok, yeah you trash the other person. like how hillary started the whole &quot;is obama even born in the US&quot; thing</p>

<p>but manipulating the media and rigging the DNC against sanders so he had 0 chance to win, i dont see how any person in the US, let alone any bernie supporter, can be ok with that kind of underhandedness and someone so undemocratic can be a possible choice for the presidency. </p>

<p>thats not even getting in to how the FBI gave her a free &#39;get out of jail&#39; card, which reinforces the fact that such a corrupt piece of shit should not be in public office at all</p>

<p>until the retarded public wakes up, and clears ALL the useless career politicians out, republican and democrat, this shit will keep going on. but they don&#39;t care, and actually at this point i&#39;ve pretty much stopped caring as well. the only thing that bothers me now is that people pretend the system is not rigged &amp; corrupt</p>

    <div class="md"><p>A lot of people feel the same way, they just don&#39;t feel like they don&#39;t have any agency. What can your average person do to achieve those ends? When you&#39;re presented with two options and told to choose one, and that there&#39;s no other options and it doesn&#39;t matter whether you feel the system shouldn&#39;t work like that, it feels like your only option is just to pick one and get it over with. It&#39;s not encouraging. </p>

<p>Your average person will make a small stand, see no results, and give up. There&#39;s no incentive to be the only person working against the system if you feel your efforts aren&#39;t going to resort into anything meaningful. If nobody finds these people and puts them in a group or gives them access to resources and options then they give up and accept the current system as the only option. </p>

Yes, Reddit largely ate Hillarys ass out during the primaries, but after the the last few months they&#39;ve come to the realization that the only choice now is Trump or Hillary. Most of them accept that they have to support Hillary even with all her flaws because the alternative is much worse.

People have forgotten that if you compare almost <em>anybody</em> to trump, they look better. As a result, people have become fervent Hilary supporters.

    <div class="md"><p>Honestly, unless a lot of redditors are just sheep it seems fairly obvious how bought the hillary love is. Even with a reasonable mildy anti hillary but still admission that I will vote for hillary post I was downvoted quickly to -15 or so. </p>

<p>Hillary is the best option, but you can see the shills starting to try to make hillary look cool by trying to make hillary memes by losting mfw style things.</p>

<p>We seem to be in the middle of a bit of an attempt to make it seem like she is level headed and not bought. Lots of whitewashing of her character is going on in the past few weeks.</p>

<p>I want her to win over Trump, but unless you are praising her blindly the paid for accounts will downvote or the sheep will downvote. Dissenting opinions on the election are unwelcome on reddit. And this is comong from someone whonhates trump with a passion and is very mich not anti immigration and pro woman.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was a sanders supporter and I understand how to compromise.  Passing liberal policies is clearly much easier under Clinton than trump.  Plus,  Clinton is actually capable of doing the job.</p>

<p>People keep trying to say &quot;they&#39;re both bad&quot; but they are orders of magnitudes different.  Hillary will be just as liberal as Obama.  I&#39;d like more but I&#39;ll take it because I&#39;m not an idiot.  In that time I&#39;ll also do what I can to get our election process reformed.  People hate hearing it, but we all know that voting third party will not change anything except maybe make you feel better at night.  Until we get a different election process it&#39;s pointless.  So for now I&#39;ll vote for okay and keep trying to get a system where there&#39;s more than two possible parties.  To be fair though, I did donate to Johnsons campaign because I actually really respect him and his ability to argue different economic policy reasonably.  I don&#39;t plan on donating to Clinton. </p>

<p>Unfortunately there were a handful of Bernie supporters that thought it would be one election and done.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I respect your opinions even if we have different views, but I think if we do not give the third party options a fighting chance, then it will never change. If everybody has the attitude of pushing it off, it will never happen.</p>

<p>It&#39;s a bummer for people like us, where neither candidate directly fits our views. I would like a candidate that is more like how this country was founded. One, where the states have more control and the federal government takes the back seat. I don&#39;t agree with many federal policies and aid programs because they do not work across the whole country. America is vast and very different from coast to coast. Things like a $15 minimum wage makes sense in New York City or LA, but does it make sense in Eau Claire, WI? In Eau Claire, you can buy a 2 bed, 2 bath, 2 car garage, 2 lot house for under $100,000, you couldn&#39;t even share an apartment for $100,000 a year in NYC.</p>

<p>I like choice and governments that work for the local people. People always point to Europe as their ideal liberal government state, but all of those countries are smaller than Texas and much more easy to manage due to size.</p>

If I could get Johnson as president and a Sanders type as governor I&#39;d be a happy dude. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, they really are just the same old shit everyone knew. Like it&#39;s not fucking shocking that a corporately owned establishment politician said things that Wall Street wanted to hear in a fucking paid speech to Wall Street. Everyone already thinks she&#39;s a shill.</p>

<p>And as much as Trumptards try to blow it off the reason this audio release from Trump is so shocking is that it explicitly jumps another level: from just saying things about women&#39;s bodies to admitting to kissing and touching women &quot;by the pussy&quot; without their permission. &quot;When you&#39;re a star they let you.&quot; I.E. a presidential candidate bragging about getting away with sexual assault.</p>

<p>When a tape leaks of Hillary Clinton gleefully bragging to some celebrity about how easy it was to delete her emails so all the stupid plebs would never know how secretly evil she is, then you&#39;ll have a case if it doesn&#39;t dominate the news cycle. But until then it&#39;s just more Trump supporter bullshit.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Depends on what you find interesting. If you don&#39;t care at all that Hillary flat out lies to the public when telling us what she will do as president, only to promise wall street something entirely different in private, then yes, buzzfeed/huffpo pretty much covered those things already. What they fail to mention is that the leak included more than just her paid speech transcripts, and as the leak itself is titled, are more about what a piece of shit Podesta is in general. </p>

<p><a href="http://www.zerohedge.com/news/2016-10-08/podesta-files-show-illegal-coordination-david-brock-super-pac">http://www.zerohedge.com/news/2016-10-08/podesta-files-show-illegal-coordination-david-brock-super-pac</a>
That&#39;s a decent enough summary of one of the most popular emails. The only thing preventing Podesta from being in jail right is the timing of this email, though he will still be in court over this. Is this going to get Hillary arrested, herself? Of course not, she is far too intelligent to do any of the dirty work herself. She uses minions like Podesta and Schultz to do the illegal shit so none of it can be directly pinned on her. It&#39;s how she got this far to begin with. </p>

<p>The culmination of this impending lawsuit on Podesta is not being discussed anywhere that I have seen, except in the far right leaning media channels that are pretty much banned universally on reddit except for in the_donald. I haven&#39;t read the rest of the emails myself, I couldn&#39;t care less honestly because I&#39;m not voting for her anyway. But to pretend sites like Huffington Post and Buzzfeed are fair and balanced in their reporting of anything that could make Hillary look bad is hilarious. The fact that Buzzfeed is the article that /politics chose to upvote to the top is the biggest joke of 2016 and a great indication of just how far reddit has fallen. A website that exists simply to churn out clickbait garbage content for ad money is now a legitimate source of news, well done.</p>

<p>Oh, also, this was 2000 of supposedly over 50,000 (that&#39;s not even 5%) emails they have, and many articles I have seen have implied that this was the whole leak and it was the end of wikileaks involvement with Hillary. Combined with the convenient timing of an 11 year old recording of Trump talking shit, it seems that they very much want everyone to stop looking, which should be interesting enough on its own.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;Wikileaks themselves highlighted emails related to the “Uranium One Deal,” where Hillary Clinton, as Secretary of State, signed away significant amounts, one-fifth, of US Uranium resources to Russia. Following the deal, millions of dollars were donated to the Clinton Foundation from individuals directly connected to the deal, including the Chairman of Uranium One, Ian Telfer&quot;</p>

<p>To quote directly from Clinton’s words: “If everybody’s watching, you know, all of the back room discussions and the deals, you know, then people get a little nervous, to say the least. So, you need both a public and a private position.”</p>

Let&#39;s accept that Hillary is the fake, the fraud, the lie that everyone believes she is, and that her cabinet and every staffer under her is in on this fraud, that she&#39;s bloodthirsty and trump is the true isolationist he isn&#39;t, and let&#39;s assume that everything people want to believe about her is true. voting democrat is still a step in a better direction. we won&#39;t have bernie now, maybe a bernie next time. possibly depending on where you live all the downballot folks are much more bernie than they are hillary. even granted all these unreasonable and untrue arguments, unless you are a god damned millionaire you are a fucking moron to vote anyone but democrat.</p>

<p>That&#39;s why he tasked the DOJ to make damned sure that any white that defends against black assault has their lives ruined. See Zimmerman, that cop in Ferguson that now can&#39;t get a job at Walmart because he defended himself against a black man punching him in the face while trying to take his gun.</p>

<p>The official stance is that a white being beaten by a black should just take it and hope to not die or be maimed for life. If not they get a civil rights suit and a media lynching making sure they never work again.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well the modern use of the word racism usually refers to white racism. In the olden days people were more xenophobic, hating anyone who wasn&#39;t from their country even if they looked similar. Like Japan vs Korean or England vs France. Basically everyone though that everyone not from their country sucked. But when europeans discovered America and explored Africa there was such a huge gap in stuff like scinece and technology that they actually thought that other races were inferior. Like it was the educated scientists who first believed this. </p>

<p>But that&#39;s besides the point. Even if Obama made untrue statements I don&#39;t think it would have a significant effect on race relations. His words aren&#39;t that important. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, they covered it multiple times, especially FOX, who seemed particularly dedicated to hurricane footage last night while everyone else was talking about Trump&#39;s announcement. I mean they didn&#39;t even break to mention it, but that Network is built around promoting conservative views. However Hillary&#39;s stuff just isn&#39;t that damning. Sanders of all people hasn&#39;t withdrawn his support and meanwhile Trump is hemmoraging endorsements on top of already painful post debate slump. What&#39;s more women represent 53% of the electorate. </p>

<p>The leaks show Hillary as contradictory on some stances and even more crucially point toward her being OK with saying one thing and doing another, but it&#39;s nothing all that new, and merely reinforces a bunch of already well trod talking points about her weaknesses. </p>

<p>Trump on the other hand is in a situation where many top GOP officials can no longer support him and hope to win their races. We&#39;re looking at a major schism forming in one half of the American political labdscape. Established politicians who normally fall into line at election time are actually calling for him to step down with 30 days left until election time, which is utterly unprecedented in modern presidential politics. Compare that to a politician giving different messages to different groups and tell me why that&#39;s the more important story. Nothing destroys a politician in America like a sex scandal, and this one hits all of the right buttons for Americans.</p>

<p>This is the thing that bothers me about this though. Both of these things are already showing us stuff we know. One is undeniable proof that Trump is a scumbag... except we&#39;ve already known this. We&#39;ve known it since we&#39;ve known Trump existed that he&#39;s a scumbag. This is nothing new.</p>

<p>We have pretty solid proof that Clinton is not going to keep her word on anything because her positions are not what she says they are and she will lie and cheat and say anything to get what she wants and it&#39;s all meaningless. We already knew this too though.</p>

<p>We already know these are both completely fucking terrible people to try and put into this job and there were so many better options. Why the hell isn&#39;t that the story here?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Actually fivethirtyeight has an interesting theory on this. </p>

<p>&quot;Writing about what makes political scandals stick in 2008, my colleague Nate Silver pointed out that the most potent scandals reinforce a “core negative perception about the candidate, particularly one that had henceforth been difficult to articulate” — but not a perception that’s already received so much coverage that “little further damage can be done.”  </p>

<p><a href="http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/will-the-trump-tape-have-a-bigger-effect-on-the-race-than-past-controversies/">http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/will-the-trump-tape-have-a-bigger-effect-on-the-race-than-past-controversies/</a>  </p>

<p>I think Trump&#39;s flaws haven&#39;t been particularly difficult to articulate, however the big difference between his remarks to Fiorina at the debate, his history on Howard Stern, his row with Megyn Kelly and others is the candor of the hot mic. The particularly graphic word choice certainly can&#39;t help either, but for once he&#39;s pinned and can&#39;t easily explain away his mistake. </p>

<p>The stuff about Clinton, by ckmparison, is more of the same. Not that she has any good explanations for the email server. I think the right may have shot themseoves in the foot here strategically by hitting her so relentlessly over this throughout the campaign. If it hadn&#39;t been so well covered this might seem more like a bombshell, at least going by Silver&#39;s theory.</p>

<p>This is a way of thinking about it: you know how the global chess game in the middle east right now has involved them via fake grass roots &quot;revolution&quot; (Arab Spring, hello), uprooting governments, making entire regions unstable and thrusting them into chaos, only to also back forces in the power vacuum that ensues?</p>

<p>The Republican party has been no different. They started a schism, co-opted and/created any organic reactions in the growing power vacuum, and now sponsor the engineered dialectic coming back out of it. They are completely reshaping and restructuring culture and society.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well it is interesting to consider. Tim Weiner who has covered the U.S. Intelligence Community for over 20 years with the New York Times wrote one of the better researched histories of the CIA, &quot;Legacy of Ashes&quot;. In that you can see one of the tried and true tactics for pushing any national agenda is to find the people in the country who support your ideas and either openly or covertly support them with money, weapons, intelligence, and sometimes a little nudge in the right direction. </p>

<p>This is pretty well documented throughout U.S. history. In Afghanistan in the 80&#39;s we had a vested interest in keeping the Russians out and were able to arm the Mujahadeen (and specifically Osama Bin Laden) at unprecedented levels. Believe it or not there were some ethics involved here. The CIA had trouble getting the OK for this plan until it was confirmed that the Mujahadeen weren&#39;t being pushed in front of the Russians as U.S. cannon fodder. Once they confirmed that with or without CIA support Osama and his buddies would be taking on the Russians, then it no longer seemed too Machiavellian to provide them with better equipment. Of course we all know what happened only a few decades later, and soon it was us, not the Russians invading Afghanistan where began a pattern of arming and funding the Northern Alliance rebels.  </p>

<p>I was actually watching a lecture on C-Span today where in the Q&amp;A they covered this very topic. (Amazing lecture btw, by this guy: <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Extremism-America-George-Michael/dp/0813044979">https://www.amazon.com/Extremism-America-George-Michael/dp/0813044979</a>). He pointed out that there are some Russian white sepratists who have been endorsed by Putin (whose government you&#39;ll recall has now been formally accused of meddling in U.S. elections with hacking and cyberattacks), who advocate a global alliance of sorts among various disaffected groups on the political fringe. Indeed, I have heard of Palestinian freedom fighters being in contact with BLM activists, and let&#39;s not forget Al Quaeda has an English language magazine to say nothing of the sophisticated media  arm of ISIS. Heck, even Russia has RT and SputnikNews which are funded and run by the Russian state and which Putin humself has even said cannot help but taking on the Russian perspective. The Columbia Journalism review has covered their blatanly biased reporting too.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s probably a mix at best. It&#39;s a lot more costly and difficult for a nation to create a movement out of thin air. When you fund, arm, etc. a group that&#39;s already taking things the direction you want you utilize their resources and dave yourself money and time. The big bonus though is authenticity which is difficult to fake.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It is news! News is whatever gets you watching/reading that gets advertising dollars and viewership. It just so happens that the most recent news is that of Trump making a baffoon of himself before he ever had presidential ambitions. This October surprise is an example why so many politicians strive to keep their appearances clean, regardless of if they are clean, and vet candidates when running for higher office. Your skeletons and even seemingly inconsequential details will be dug up and used against you. It&#39;s happening now. That&#39;s news. Oh also how republicans who want to survive the post-election environment  by bailing on their already reluctant support of Trump is huge news. When has this happened in presidential history?</p>

<p>&quot;Nishimura, however, caused the materials to be downloaded and stored on his personal, unclassified electronic devices and storage media. He carried such classified materials on his unauthorized media when he traveled off-base in Afghanistan and, ultimately, carried those materials back to the United States at the end of his deployment. In the United States, Nishimura continued to maintain the information on unclassified systems in unauthorized locations, and copied the materials onto at least one additional unauthorized and unclassified system.&quot;</p>

<p>I&#39;m saying what she did was wrong by my standards and basic industry standards.  It is impossible to be both a competent leader and ignorant of these standards in 2016.  My standards aren&#39;t unreasonable, they&#39;re the standards I enforced when I worked as a HIPAA security officer.  They&#39;re the standards applied by that same government.  If the company I served did what Clinton did, we would have rightly been fined out of existence by the government.</p>

<p>Ignorance isn&#39;t an excuse.  And incidentally, judges don&#39;t tell people right and wrong.  They just make legal decisions.  Anyone in the legal field knows that.  The law can be completely backwards, spend a few hours in a legislative session and you&#39;ll see how.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Because OP and people upvoting this shit thread are bitter about Trump not winning, so they&#39;re trying hard to find an explanation. The cognitive dissonance of admitting that the reason Trump is not winning is Trump himself would be too painful. They have to find something else. It must be a conspiration ! The whole world hating Trump is a conspiration, and anyone disliking him is in fact a bot or a shill, or even a shillbot !</p>

<p>This is why this sub is shit. Instead of credible and interesting conspiracies, you get this kind of people in denial thinking their bias is proof. &quot;Oh but if I blatantly ignore what proves my logic to be wrong, don&#39;t you think this looks <em>strange</em> to you ?&quot; Yep, 100% conspiracy material here.</p>

<p>Other highlights include more evidence that Hillary is colluding with mainstream media sources like the NYT, John Oliver, etc. on what they say about her/Trump, which is something everyone should have known she did already, but nothing is wrong with having more evidence. People should be disgusted but apparently everyone still trusts these media sources to be fair and impartial, so it still needs to be pointed out. As I said in the linked post, I haven&#39;t read through all of the emails myself because I honestly do not care, I am merely responding to people in this thread because I have seen the brainwashing machine working magically this weekend due to people&#39;s blind faith in sites like Buzzfeed (one of the biggest pieces of shit on the internet) to give them the whole story from a neutral point of view.</p>

<p>Really people should be asking themselves why Buzzfeed was chosen as the article linked in /politics, it&#39;s almost like the Hillary campaign knows people have already lost faith in sources like the NYT and decided to go with a new face. Resorting to that garbage to break the news is the most interesting thing about this cycle, shows that the average internet user actually trusts fucking <em>Buzzfeed</em> more than they trust veteran media outlets.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I read the latest one. The one OP is talking about that wasn&#39;t even her email. You know, the one with the speeches that everyone was chomping at the bit about, claiming &quot;she won&#39;t release her speeches, so they <em>must</em> be terrible! </p>

<p>The one where they had someone go through her old speeches to find anything that might bite her in the ass, and the worst he found was Hillary admitting that she&#39;s a little out of touch with the lower class, and that sometimes getting shit done in politics involves not saying in public exactly what&#39;s happening in private.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I mean, you&#39;re wrong, but I&#39;m not really arguing about that, I&#39;m arguing about how the articles popular leftist media has spun to talk about this leak have been extremely misleading (big surprise) in order to downplay the significance of the leak. If you think there is nothing there then I can already tell it&#39;s a waste of time to try to change your opinion. Promising voters one thing and wall street another thing is pretty fucked up.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I haven&#39;t actually read any articles about the leak; just the emails themselves. The whole time, I was thinking &quot;wow, she really should have just released all of this months ago&quot;, because there is literally nothing scandalous in there.</p>

<p>That&#39;s the thing about people claiming how the &quot;leftist media&quot; is always defending Hillary and going after Trump; Hillary keeps getting made-up scandal after made-up scandal thrown at her, and <em>none</em> of it sticks, even when we spend millions on congressional hearings <em>looking</em> for a scandal, despite thirty-plus years in politics.</p>

<p>Trump, on the other hand, has actual scandals piled up in his closet, and the media just ignores them because stories about Trump acting crazy yesterday get more clicks.</p>

<p>That&#39;s the real conspiracy in political media; money outweighs any political bias in reporting, every day. They&#39;re going to report on what gets clicks and views in a landscape where the news media is becoming more and more irrelevant and they&#39;re just desperately trying to hang on.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The funny part to all of this is that you think I got to the leak via a buzzfeed article. I didn&#39;t even know buzzfeed had written one. The link I clicked to find them was one with a headline that was very clearly anti-Hillary, acting like <em>these</em> emails would be the ones that <em>finally</em> bury the Hillary campaign. At last!</p>

<p>I though &quot;oh interesting! Let&#39;s see what&#39;s in here... oh. Uh... k.&quot;</p>

<p>I&#39;ve looked through your comments on this thread, and you haven&#39;t posted anything I haven&#39;t already read, so either you&#39;ve read exactly as much as I have, or you read more and didn&#39;t find anything more damning than what&#39;s being pushed by the media.</p>

<p>If you, a pretty clear anti-Hillary, possibly pro-Trump alarmist didn&#39;t find anything remotely scandalous, why should I waste my time by reading all of the emails?</p>

<p>You can tell yourself whatever you want about me, but assuming that everyone that disagrees with you is naive or uninformed is kind of the definition of &quot;having your mind made up&quot;, so maybe you shouldn&#39;t be throwing stones. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not defending Trump. That stuff has every right to be published and reach the top or <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a>. But Clinton has had a very questionable email dump and that isn&#39;t in sight on their subreddit other than a &quot;clinton email dump is boring&quot; post. </p>

<p>If they&#39;re going to call themselves <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a> they should be neutral in their moderation/censorship. The donald subreddit can post what it wants because when you visit there you know what the bias is. <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a> presents itself as neutral but, from what i have seen this last month, it is not.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That might be because of any combination of the following:</p>

<p>A) People are in general immune to &quot;HILLARY! EMAIL! SCAAAAANDAL!&quot;. This is all the result of literally years of Republicans continuing to push a retarded narrative about Hillary&#39;s supposed role in the Benghazi attack. Nobody cares anymore. Everybody who isn&#39;t unhinged knows she had nothing to do with that. Sorry, but the anti-Hillary crowd has poisoned that well already.</p>

<p>2) Some of the content &quot;leaked&quot; is provably false. Mixed with much that is provably (or at least believably) true. The easiest way to make people disbelieve a source of information is to find one provable falsehood.</p>

<p>3) People constantly push such stories about Clinton that turn out to be complete malarkey. I mean there&#39;s literally thousands of people in this sub alone that genuinely believe the Clintons have been having people killed for decades.</p>

<p>4) Networks aren&#39;t going to push stories that don&#39;t get ratings. Info people aren&#39;t going to care about isn&#39;t going to get ratings.</p>

<p>5) Trump&#39;s campaign has just gone from a train wreck to an industrial train wreck.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not sure why people keep asking this question. &quot;Why isn&#39;t Hillary getting the extreme negative coverage I think she should be getting?!&quot; Because the people who hate her have made her bulletproof. I don&#39;t particularly care for her either but as her primary opponent is Donald &quot;Grab &#39;em by the pussy&quot; Trump, it would seem to be an easy choice.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>How does every article about Hillary being a horrible person get turned into a trump bashing. Can we just discuss all the bullshit that she has done for once? Go home paid Hillary supporters. </p>

<p>Her charity is all about evading tax dollars and getting into other countries to exploit there natural resources. She has lied over and over and changed her stance every 3 days. She doesn&#39;t want to ever be seen by the American people. She has as much ties and more to Russia. She thinks drone bombing people or just plain having them murdered is a solution. She blamed her shortcomings in Benghazi to a video! A video! She lied to the parents face about this. Her husband is twice as deplorable as trump and she has covered up and shamed any woman that went against her. She is all powerful and thinks she can&#39;t be touched. With that mindset you do whatever you want. If you think for a second she gives two shits about the American people you are living in a fantasy land. Vote for her and say good bye to American because it won&#39;t be here. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Or people are just smarter than that.  </p>

<p>You have to admit continuing to whine about Clinton in the face of Trump is ridiculous.  I&#39;m amazed <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> has been dragged down so far they are just an anti-Hillary arm of the Trump machine. </p>

<p>What is with the &quot;paid speeches&quot;?  As though no one else gets paid?  It&#39;s a pathetic attempt to manufacture outrage, since even Republicans aren&#39;t falling for it.  Of course she gets paid.  You might be born yesterday and not be aware that MOST speeches are paid events, including graduation speeches and speeches given by Republican representatives.  </p>

<p>Remember when <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> had a certain intelligent edge?  Yeah, there was some tinfoil stupidity but you guys weren&#39;t led around by a ring in your nose.  </p>

<p>Now when the Trumpets say &quot;Hillary&quot; <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> jumps like they got goosed.  Did he grab your pussies?  </p>

<p>I&#39;m embarrassed for you people.  You can&#39;t even be real conspiracy buffs, you&#39;re just another Trump forum.  </p>

<p>Man, the Trump folks sure did a great job taking over and ruining a bunch of subs.  Fortunately most of them didn&#39;t allow it.  But you guys did.  They had to create uncensorednews because they couldn&#39;t take over <a href="/r/news">/r/news</a>.  </p>

<p>But you guys rolled over and presented those glistening little minds, just ready to be pumped full of Trump.  </p>

<p>Good lord, this is shameful.  Nut up and take back your manhood, cucks.  </p>

<p>Hillary Clinton is a criminal bought and paid for by private interest. She is duplicitous in nature and holds complete contempt for the people she claims to represent.</p>

<p>Donald Trump is mentally unstable and literally a fascist. He is high on his own self built delusion and wouldn&#39;t think twice about tearing up the constitution.</p>

<p>Good luck America, but I think you&#39;re all fucked no matter the outcome.</p>

<p>Are you delusional, or just retarded? Nobody is censoring you, the majority of the people outside your spam safe space are tired of someone who talks about sexually assaulting women like its nothing. And before you go &quot;but muh Bill Clinton,&quot; he&#39;s not the one in the fucking race, and he&#39;s never been on camera saying he can do anything he wants to women because he&#39;s rich and powerful.</p>

<p>You seem to think you&#39;re the majority here and that the only reason you see bad things about Trump is because of evil shills who care so much about a relatively niche website who&#39;s largest demographics are some of the least likely groups to vote, but it&#39;s honestly just people realizing that they hate Trump more than they could possibly dislike Hillary.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not a conspiracy person but I am genuinely curious. Do you think it&#39;s possible that the reason Hillary&#39;s stuff is not hitting the front page right now is that trumps stuff is so much more horrific at this point in time? Basically a case that the typical crooked politician stuff Hillary does has been been totally outplayed by the lecherous old man groping up women at every opportunity stuff?  Both the media and the public are prone to running directly towards the biggest fire and putting it on the Front page.</p>

<p>If Hillary wins by rigging an election, what proof do you have that Trump had more supporters.</p>

<p>They control the media and the web. Facebook, Twitter Google (to some extent)and Reddit and countless news agencies.</p>

<p>People will look on the web and only find information supporting the idea that Hillary was the popular choice.</p>

<p>Example, would love to know what happens when all of you google hillary clinton.</p>

Hillary has earned nearly every newspaper endorsement of the general election. Here&#39;s why:hrc.io/2doDPyY&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I did see one earlier that basically said that her speeches were released and it was exactly what she said would be in them the article they linked to was bull shit. I want to say it was world news or something other than this sub which is the only reason I read it because I thought someone had finally caught on to it but it was a white wash. I saw it while I was at work and I can&#39;t find it now for the life of me. I looked at the comments and they were things like &quot;I used to be a huge die hard bernie supporter and I hated Hillary Clinton but this makes me trust her so much more now&quot; and &quot;If there was something there to find then the officials would have charged her already&quot; I just about threw up. I had to nope the fuck out. I suppose I should have said something cause then I would actually be able to find it now. It was pretty much shill paradise. Nothing is going to happen with this unless we make it happen.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I wasn&#39;t looking for evidence within them there was already more than enough to convict her present and they didn&#39;t do anything with it I knew this would just be more of the same. I just read them so that I wouldn&#39;t have to hear it second hand. I&#39;m disappointed in our justice system for not taking the evidence already present of her crimes and prosecuting as opposed to the obvious cover up we already got, and I am disappointed that the DNC is being allowed to launder money into Hillary&#39;s campaign and keep other candidates from being able to run a fair and just race. I am also disappointed that Hillary is so corrupt she has placed herself above the law. I am disappointed that we are going to have yet another president coming from the same 2 families, which just about conclusively shows me that you can no longer rise to the highest office of the land unless you are born rich and can buy out an election. I don&#39;t believe that her opposing candidate is an accident that no one saw coming this is all just a farce to get her elected since the major corporations started buying into her almost a year before this election. More than anything I am just disappointed that America has sunk so low that these are our choices and we have yet to take to the streets to demand change in large enough numbers to actually get it. If you could look at those emails and feel like you trust her more then you did before you are a fool, my hope is most people didn&#39;t read them and they don&#39;t honestly feel that way.</p>

<p>Again you&#39;re from the twitter generation without being condescending. You see a tiny bit of information and you think Hillary is new to all this. She&#39;s not</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yea... Those stories ran their course in January and March respectively.  The media isn&#39;t going to spend 24/7 talking about year-old news to appease a subsection reddit.  We&#39;re not talking about Malaysia flight 270.  We&#39;re not talking about Freddie Gray.  We&#39;re not talking about Ukraine.  We&#39;re not talking about Nice.  </p>

<p>And before you get up and arms because it&#39;s a presidential campaign:  We&#39;re also not talking about Trumps KKK endorsement,  Trump&#39;s comments about paying for lawyers if his supporters commit assault, Trump&#39;s spat with the Fox news anchor, Trump calling a black supporter &quot;My African&quot;, Trump&#39;s Kim Jung Un style singing girls, Trump&#39;s refusal to pay for said girls, Trump not knowing Russia invaded Ukraine, Trump&#39;s horrific chaplain at the convention, The convention&#39;s plagiarized speech, or many of the other things trump has done.</p>

<p>This isn&#39;t some conspiracy to promote Clinton.  This is simply a candidate who is thoughtful and patient when she speaks and as a result, slips a lot less often than Trump.  Because of this, she ends up with bad press a lot less often than Trump.  If you wanted to see fewer anti-republican posts on the front page, you should have picked one of the other 14 candidates.</p>

<p>Reddit is a giant conglomerate of every corner of the internet. A veritable dataminer&#39;s wet dream. All this info in one place, near complete anonymity. Pair that with the ability to hide your presence and a large brigade of individuals to trawl for a purpose and you have Reddit&#39;s secret police.</p>

<p>If anything Reddit is the best PsyOp tool ever made. Just like Facebook. Each move you make is tracked and publicly available, difficult to make truly private. Public opinion and knowledge has been shaped by things that start here, least of which are just memes.</p>

<p>Pile on top of that &quot;heuristics&quot; that magically create &quot;top comments&quot; via a &quot;voting system&quot; and you can make any thread say anything you want. Then in the comments just pay another brigade to troll or stir the shitpot when something intelligent and critical pops up into discussion that the client does not want talked about.</p>

I think the poster below has it when he/she says Clinton lies like a politician, Trump lies like an alcoholic. 
I can&#39;t believe Americans would want to be represented by this man. He would never speak or act for me. The conspiracy is how he got this far and has been taken seriously.
It is time for the Republican party to withdraw their backing and give up on this presidential race for a greater good than their own- that of their country and their people.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This post reeks of it being someone&#39;s first election cycle on reddit. Here&#39;s how reddit worked in 2008:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Barack Obama announces his canidacy. Internet falls in love with him. </p></li>
<li><p>For the entire first half of the primaries <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a> totally ignores the Republican race and fills the page with positive articles about Obama and attacks on Clinton. </p></li>
<li><p>Clinton concedes, and overnight <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a> returns to non-stop Republican bashing. </p></li>
</ul>

<p>In 2012 it pretty much stayed 100% Republican bashing because there was no Democratic primary.</p>

<p>tl;dr Reddit has, and always will be, a Democratic circlejerk. There&#39;s no shilling going on, just the basic fact that reddit skews heavily democratic. Please stop with this shill nonsense, and unless you can find users and conclusively prove they are on the payroll of someone (and proof does not inlcude &quot;but they put nothing but pro-Clinton stuff!&quot;) sstop. </p>

<p>You know what isn&#39;t cute? Being so self absorbed that you think that was about you and not the person I was talking about. That&#39;s not cute.</p>

<p>Treason is a serious charge. Don&#39;t weaken it by claiming this email bullshit is treason, it isnt. It&#39;s stupid, it&#39;s corrupt, but it isn&#39;t at all treason. Be smarter than that.</p>

<p>People who buy into this Hillary for prison pro trump bullshit are all bigger idiots than he is, and that&#39;s saying something. Call it what it is, she hasn&#39;t committed treason, at worst she&#39;s guilty of being a corrupt insider politician. So fucking what? They all are. The other 3 being obviously worse candidates despite this is exactly why she is going to win, and should win. </p>

<p>I was completely dressed. I had a skirt and a blouse. He tore the waist of my skirt. And then he ripped my pantyhose. And he raped me. It was very vicious. I was just pinned down… I did not know what to do. I was so frightened. I was only 35 at the time. And it was horrible. I just wanted it to be over with. So he would go away.</p>

<p>And then as he points over my shoulder, he grabs me and turns me to him. And that was a shock. And I tried to push him away. And I only weighed about 120 pounds at that time. He was a very large man. And I kept telling him, “No. I don’t want this at all.”</p>

<p>And he grabbed me again, very forcefully. And started biting on my top lip. And this was extremely painful. I thought he was going to bite my lip off. And that’s when he pushed me back onto the bed.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was thinking exactly the same thing.... Hillary is a disgusting human being, Everything she gets involved in is laced with illegal activity and fed to the public as an ice cream sundae complete with the cherry on top. 
  Sadly, the american people just eat it up and allow her to continue making us all look like begging bottom feeders that are desperate for welfare and a free college education. She should be ashamed of herself and jump off of a bridge. 
  Trump is no Joel Osteen but I like the fact that he is not a politician, I respect his grittiness and his honest straight forward way of telling you like it is. He isnt about &quot;political correctness&quot; and that in my opinion is refreshing.
 It seems everyone has blinders on when it comes to Hillary, I don&#39;t understand it.  Seeing how the media is soooo &quot;offended&quot; at what he said over 10 years ago during a conversation between two men is pathetic. He sounds like a normal red blooded dude that you can overhear anywhere nowadays. The naive virgin ears people are pretending to have is a joke. When your offended at words that don&#39;t even involve you is only showing your brainwashed mindset. 
BE BETTER. BE MENTALLY STRONGER. DAMN!!</p>

    <div class="md"><p><strong>Jeffrey Epstein</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Former President Bill Clinton was a much more frequent flyer on a registered sex offender’s infamous jet than previously reported, with flight logs showing the former president taking at least 26 trips aboard the “Lolita Express” -- even apparently ditching his Secret Service detail for at least five of the flights, according to records.</p>

<p>Epstein, who counts among his pals royal figures, heads of state, celebrities and fellow billionaires, spent 13 months in prison and home detention for solicitation and procurement of minors for prostitution. He allegedly had a team of traffickers who procured girls as young as 12 to service his friends on “Orgy Island,” an estate on Epstein&#39;s 72-acre island, called Little St. James, in the U.S. Virgin Islands.</p>

<p>Florida attorney Brad Edwards, who represented some of Epstein’s alleged victims, is suing the federal government over the secret non-prosecution agreement in hopes of having it overturned. Edwards claimed in court records that the government and Epstein concealed the deal from the victims “to prevent them from voicing any objection, and to avoid the firestorm of controversy that would have arisen if it had become known that the Government was immunizing a politically-connected billionaire and all of his co-conspirators from prosecution of hundreds of federal sex crimes against minor girls.”</p>

<p>And as much as Trumptards try to blow it off the reason this audio release from Trump is so shocking is that it explicitly jumps another level: from just saying things about women&#39;s bodies to admitting to kissing and touching women &quot;by the pussy&quot; without their permission. &quot;When you&#39;re a star they let you.&quot; I.E. a presidential candidate bragging about getting away with sexual assault.</p>

<p>When a tape leaks of Hillary Clinton gleefully bragging to some celebrity about how easy it was to delete her emails so all the stupid plebs would never know how secretly evil she is, then you&#39;ll have a case if it doesn&#39;t dominate the news cycle.

    <div class="md"><p>You underestimate the importance of large environmental firms. They pave the way for countless small businesses to compete for work they would otherwise be incapable of completing (some contracts require small women owned business involvement). They employ civil engineers, construction departments, etc.</p>

<p>It&#39;s not just environmental scientists. In fact, I would say environmental consulting firms incorporate more employees that aren&#39;t directly experienced in environmental work. </p>

<p>For instance, for some work on a navy installation, our contracting group hired a small company to complete almost the entirety of the work (often called pass through). The effects of reducing environmental compliance is far reaching, not even including the environmental base argument of saving the world.</p>
