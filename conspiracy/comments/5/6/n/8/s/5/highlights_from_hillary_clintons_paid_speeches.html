<p>&quot;If you look at the single-payer systems, like Scandinavia, Canada, and elsewhere, they can get costs down because, you know, although their care, according to statistics, overall is as good or better on primary care, in particular, they do impose things like waiting times, you know. It takes longer to get like a hip replacement than it might take here.” [Hillary Clinton remarks to ECGR Grand Rapids, 6/17/13]</p>

<p>Clinton Cited President Johnson’s Success In Establishing Medicare And Medicaid And Said She Wanted To See The U.S. Have Universal Health Care Like In Canada.

<p><strong>analysis of Clinton&#39;s position on Social Security</strong> - a comment by <a href="/u/ackthppt">/u/ackthppt</a></p>

<p>This from David Sirota: <a href="http://www.ibtimes.com/political-capital/hillary-clinton-paid-speeches-wall-street-promoted-commission-pushed-social">http://www.ibtimes.com/political-capital/hillary-clinton-paid-speeches-wall-street-promoted-commission-pushed-social</a></p>

<p>Clinton on the campaign trail declared, “I won’t cut Social Security.” Yet in the email’s excerpts of her Morgan Stanley speech, she lauded a presidential commission that proposed changes that would slash Social Security benefits, according to experts.</p>

<p>The email shows Clinton specifically telling Morgan Stanley that the Simpson-Bowles commission “put forth the right framework” for dealing with fiscal challenges. She also said “the Simpson-Bowles framework and the big elements of it were right.”</p>

<p>As the nonpartisan Center on Budget and Policy Priorities reported in 2011, that commission proposed a plan to “cut benefits for the vast majority of Social Security recipients, weaken the link between a recipient’s benefits and past earnings (which could undermine public support for the program), and, despite the claims of the co-chairs, fail to protect most low-income workers from benefit cuts.”</p>

<p>Edit: added information from an email about a speech on Isis - not a paid speech </p>

<p><strong>THROWING SHADE AT ARABS</strong></p>

<p>Email Discussion about including disparaging comments about Arabs in Clinton speech on ISIS:</p>

<p>&quot;We can throw some more shade at the Arabs, though. Dan and I have an idea.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I’m glad you’re bumping that up a bit. You cover regional responsibility, but this is a big flash point for voters.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;We now have a John Anzalone memorial paragraph in the speech.&quot; (john anzalone is a Clinton&#39;s pollster, I think this is supposed to be a joke)</p>

<p>Edit: added information from an email about Israel - not a paid speech</p>

<p><strong>ISRAEL</strong></p>

<p>This email is from a Clinton surrogate who spoke with Netanyahu.</p>

<p>We discussed possible economic initiatives to help the Palestinians, like more Palestinian investment in Zone C, and/or an agreement to limit settlement expansion to the established blocs that under the Clinton parameters would be in Israel after any negotiation.</p>

<p>Abu Mazan continues to talk about retiring, as he has done for years, but seems more serious now. There is no obvious successor if he leaves, “other than the guy in jail”. (Added Marwan Barghouti)
Israel Arabs are a “real problem.” The government had to dismantle the northern branch of the Islamic Association because they were radicalizing the Israeli Arabs, who are 20% of the population.</p>

<p>But the Prime Minister and the Defense Minster, and “certainly the military and intelligence community”, want to keep the PA. There is still intelligence sharing on radicals, but when Israel asks them to arrest the radicals they identify, they refuse, and ask the Israelis to do it, and then protest the arrests. But this is all part of a scenario of cooperation. However, if the PA takes Israel to the International Criminal Court, this would be a “huge problem” and a potential game changer in terms of their relationship with the PA.</p>
