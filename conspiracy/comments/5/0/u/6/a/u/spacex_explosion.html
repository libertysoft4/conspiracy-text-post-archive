        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>It&#39;s totally possible that was an accident. Absolutely.</p>

<p>However, the Falcon 9 has flown eight missions without a hitch.</p>

<p>But this time it explodes at a time when Musk is essentially at the make-or-break point with Tesla, SpaceX, and Solar City, which I&#39;m sure the trillion dollar petroleum industry would like to see go away. His worth dropped by 3/4 of a billion dollars that day.</p>

<p>And part of the mission of the AMOS-6 satelite in the rocket was to establish broadband internet to parts of the <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/eb/Amos-6-Ka-band-coverage.svg/800px-Amos-6-Ka-band-coverage.svg.png">Middle East (Syria, Palestine, Israel, Lebanon, Jordan) and Africa</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In October 2015, social media company Facebook and satellite fleet operator Eutelsat agreed to pay $95 million over about five years to lease the Ka-band spot-beam broadband capacity — 36 regional spotbeams with a throughput of about 18 Gbit/s — on Amos-6 to provide service for Facebook’s Internet.org and a new Eutelsat subsidiary focusing on African businesses. Costs would be divided in approximately equal shares between Eutelsat and Facebook. The parties agreed to the right to terminate the contract if Amos-6 and the ground gateways in France, Italy and Israel were not ready for service by January 1, 2017. The lease extended to September 2021, with an option for a two-year extension at a reduced rate.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Maybe it&#39;s an accident.</p>

<p>But I&#39;m sure there&#39;s more than a few people who&#39;d be happier if Tesla, SpaceX, and Solar City fell on hard times, and if that Satellite never made it to orbit.</p>

<p>Didn&#39;t know where else to post it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think this is plausible, but you are assuming that Musk is on our side.  I believe he is a gatekeeper.  </p>

<p>He is in on this.  He is the reassurance to the people that the private sector is <em>so close</em> to achieving civilian space travel, solar energy, and cars that can run without oil.  He will continually fail in these efforts.  </p>

<p>Either he is a good guy and he&#39;s being sabotaged, or he is part of the scheme.  I lean towards the latter.  </p>

<p>Either way I do not believe this was an accident.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>A gatekeeper? That&#39;s a generous term for a guy who lives on Billions of Government welfare for Solar City and Spacex. Musk is a well paid Tool. He is bound by military industrial nondisclosure contracts with NASA just as Lockheed Martin and others are.</p>

<p>Like I said many times, every fake secretive launch, every private space venture that fails,  and 50 years of going nowhere suggests we have serious problems with space Travel.</p>

<p>And we can&#39;t collectively with all the smart people fix it, if it&#39;s bound by secrecy and military control. Space has been fiction for 50 years, it won&#39;t change unless we demand the Truth.</p>

<p>Just to add for OP: In my opinion, every publicized successful Spacex Launch was CGI laden bullshit..and then they go back to real launches and the same problems with rocket pay loads that Virgin Galactic proved to be difficult. But since they can&#39;t have the  public face continuous private rocket failures with putting NASA rockets in doubt, so they fake successful ones, here and there. The Public will never know cause all they have EVER shown about Space was animated on computer. </p>

It moves incredibly rapidly across the sky, much faster than any balloon could possibly be conceived to travel, and why? Because it is in low earth orbit and to maintain the altitude that it does requires immense velocity.</p>

<p>No, I do not think it can be faked and I do not think literally tens of thousands of people who have been intimately involved with the command and control of the program from countries all over the earth are ALL unilaterally &quot;in on it&quot;.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s fucking willful  ignorance for you to pretend that thousands of employees who works for NASA and the military industrial secret tech departments are not under non disclosure agreements, that their very lives and income depend upon. </p>

<p>There is a Japanese company that will create a shooting star in the sky anywhere in the World for you. And you fucking still think that blinking bullshit lights is proof NASA or Musk doing space travel, and think both who gets trillions aren&#39;t faking Space when all evidence suggests they are clearly fabricating their photos, and missions.</p>

<p>You know what?  people who believe in NASA are also stupid enough to believe office fires in WTC 7 pulverized steel columns in free fall speeds.
I don&#39;t expect much from the average joe like you, you are incapable of free thought outside the lies you are brainwashed with day in day out . You just waste my time. You just keep waiting for that Mars scam mission and pretending like the Frauds at Langley are taking photos of Jupiter when all you just watched was 1988 grade cgi animation made by guys like Robert Simmons. I have nothing against Simmons, at least Simmons knows Blue Marble is his own drawing.  but the fools who believe that it&#39;s a photo of earth? LOL. Willful blindness!</p>

<p>1.Satellites replicated by Cell towers, everywhere, when you leave their trianglation, you lose connection.</p>

<p>2.Hubble telescope,replicated by Sophia: a terrestrial plane mounted telescope, exact replica of its specs.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was a Navy Diver for six years, worked with EOD most of my career (bombs), and worked with NASA on developing procedures for ocean recovery of the Orion Deep Space Capsule. </p>

<p>I think this was very likely sabotage by either the US government or a corporate competitor. I mean think about it, SpaceX competes with serious international corporations and powerful nations. Most of which manufacture drones and hi-tech weapons systems...
If one of them wanted to blow up the rocket and leave no trace they would need to hit it with a high explosive shell that has no propellant. To do this you would need a high powered rifle and sniper at relatively close range, or use a weapons system (drone, missile, etc) that flies in close proximity to the rocket, then fires an incendiary round at the rocket with laser and computer guided precision as it flies by. This would most likely leave no trace. Something like an RPG is way too visible and leaves tons of evidence after exploding. 
Am I making any sense?     </p>

<p>You cant make this sht up! The failed launch in 2015 was never determined what the cause was, only that a strut <em>could</em> have broke, but there is no sane reason to conclude <em>why</em> it ought to have broken, they couldnt find a underperforming strut, only after trying to basically recreate the failure did a strut fail.</p>

<p>This explosion also had no reason at all to occur, SpaceX is a safe flyer, you dont see airplanes inexplicably exploding or disintegrating. No this clearly stinks of vested interest, clandestine ops and sabotage. SpaeX is an extremely <em>capable</em> launch provider, and shows how awful government/ULA spaceflight is, since theyve been running circles around them for like years. </p>

<p>Trust me, Elon is a man of the people, he&#39;s a little in the dark on climate change, but his heart is in the right place. </p>

<p>Fucking New world order!!!! </p>
