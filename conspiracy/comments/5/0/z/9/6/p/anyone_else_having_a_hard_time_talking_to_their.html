For example, the wikileaks release of DNC emails of them favoring HRC, and how DWS stepped down because of the release, ultimately admitting that she had done wrong.

Tell her you care about this issue. Then stop talking to her about the issue and tell her that you won&#39;t bother her anymore since your world view can be disruptive to hers. Then just wait for her to think about it and you&#39;ll find she eventually starts to consider the possibility. We all had to make the decision to become open to this reality and it&#39;s important that you don&#39;t try to change people brcause it feels too invasive, you have to temp them over.</p>
