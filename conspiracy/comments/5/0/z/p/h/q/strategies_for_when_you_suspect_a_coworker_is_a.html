<p>Surely there are situations where doing this has value.  Like if you know you&#39;re watched by multiple groups, and outing your knowledge would ripple observably through the group you&#39;ve caught out, for the other observers to spot.  I call this move the &quot;Personal Honeypot&quot;.  Or maybe this is too Hollywood.</p>

<p>Surely they have some sort of sick obsession with making people suffer, but if you can somehow show that you&#39;re not affected, it will hopefully just anger them and make their moves more obvious.  Anger does no good for subtlety.</p>

<p>I thought I was just suggesting that a person who denies the existence of spooks before affirming their sanity might not be sane in the first place. You know, given the probably certainty that spooks do exist and people do get targeted by them.</p>

<p>Narcs, stooges, patsies, Manchurian candidates, informants, assassins, law enforcement officers, insurgents... Plenty of spooks in the world and you sit there and imply that OP is crazy for even asking the hypothetical.</p>

<p>Do us a favor and be less impolite.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re putting a lot of words in my mouth here. I didn&#39;t deny that surveillance exists, clearly it can and does happen. </p>

<p>The question OP asks is what I would do if I felt I was under surveillance. Considering I can&#39;t fathom what I would be doing to warrant such surveillance, I would be concerned that it&#39;s an issue with my own mental health.</p>

<p>There&#39;s simply not enough information within the premise to speculate much further. We don&#39;t know if this hypothetical target is engaging in political activism, direct action, whistleblowing, etc.</p>

<p>Basically, my point is calm the fuck down.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>He suspects the CIA, or similar three-letter agencies, of running the mental health institutions, perhaps?</p>

<p>They don&#39;t need to run them, though. Asking loaded questions like, &quot;Do you think the government is out to get you?&quot;, with the implication that if you think they are then you&#39;re crazy... is enough for an ordinary mental health worker to, perhaps, believe suspicions should be treated as delusions.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t think many people are locked up for life these days, though. A few weeks to a month or so is enough to cause major interference with daily life. And the legal consequences of a trip to the mental hospital linger in ways which aren&#39;t particularly ingratiating.</p>

<p>Don&#39;t do anything self incriminating. Use proper opsec. Don&#39;t be surprised to find that they&#39;re operating using such dated technology. These are pawns you&#39;ll be 1 on 1 with. Many might not even be aware of their complicity or that they&#39;re following subliminal orders. </p>
