    <div class="md"><p>I think I can answer this one. I&#39;m in the military, see. And certain people in the US see me and feel a sense of pride that I&#39;m willing to be a soldier and potentially lose my life defending these people (or at least that&#39;s how they see it, I&#39;m really only here for the free college).</p>

<p>These same people see the national anthem as not only a symbol of the nation, but as a symbol of the sacrifice that I and my brothers and sisters in arms make every day (we lost quite a bit of our freedoms when we signed that contract). Because of this, they see not standing for the anthem as an insult to that sacrifice and it makes them mad.</p>

<p>Me personally, I&#39;d rather people express the first amendment right that they have to not stand than to blindly follow the crowd.</p>

<p>Tl;dr People are stupid and nationalistic. They idolize the military and see any straying from the crowd as a sign of disrespect to us.</p>

<p>Stealing a YT comment from Teresa Rudolf:
&quot;Humans aren&#39;t born wanting to obey orders.  Obedience is learned.  <strong>If it were natural to want to follow orders, there would be no unruly children, and parents would never feel any need to spank or otherwise punish their children to get them to obey.</strong>  So I disagree with him on that one.  Children are born inquisitive, which is why they&#39;re always asking &quot;Why?&quot; about everything.  It&#39;s true that cooperation does depend on trust and compliance, but we need to be very careful about whom we choose to trust, and there have to be limits to how much we trust someone.  We must never stop using our basic good sense or forget about what we know in our hearts is right and wrong, and we should always seek to understand why we&#39;re doing what we&#39;re doing.﻿&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>in America specifically, hyper nationalism/patriotism has had it&#39;s spikes and valleys. the most recent spike was after 9/11, it is common to band with those that seem most &quot;internal&quot; when dealing with and &quot;external&quot; threat.</p>

<p>I would assume though that the flag and anthem push hails back more to the 2nd world war; and the huge communist purge afterward that still emanates huge ripples into our own day and age. people were deported, imprisoned, and even killed solely based on their political beliefs. they were deemed the largest threat to the US way of life. if you hadn&#39;t stood up and happily sang the anthem with your hand over your heart in 1948 you&#39;d likely be in a shitstorm that meant the end of normal life for you forever....</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Daniel 3:1-30</p>

<p>Neb·u·chad·nezʹzar the king made an image of gold that was 60 cubits high and 6 cubits wide. He set it up on the plain of Duʹra in the province of Babylon. 2 Then King Neb·u·chad·nezʹzar sent word to assemble the satraps, prefects, governors, advisers, treasurers, judges, magistrates, and all the administrators of the provinces to come to the inauguration of the image that King Neb·u·chad·nezʹzar had set up.</p>

<p>3 So the satraps, prefects, governors, advisers, treasurers, judges, magistrates, and all the administrators of the provinces assembled for the inauguration of the image that King Neb·u·chad·nezʹzar had set up. And they stood in front of the image that Neb·u·chad·nezʹzar had set up. 4 The herald loudly proclaimed: “You are commanded, O peoples, nations, and language groups, 5 that when you hear the sound of the horn, pipe, zither, triangular harp, stringed instrument, bagpipe, and all the other musical instruments, you must fall down and worship the image of gold that King Neb·u·chad·nezʹzar has set up. 6 Whoever does not fall down and worship will immediately be thrown into the burning fiery furnace.” 7 So when all the peoples heard the sound of the horn, pipe, zither, triangular harp, stringed instrument, and all the other musical instruments, all the peoples, nations, and language groups fell down and worshipped the image of gold that King Neb·u·chad·nezʹzar had set up.</p>

<p>8 Now at that time some of the Chal·deʹans came forward and accused* the Jews. 9 They said to King Neb·u·chad·nezʹzar: “O king, may you live on forever. 10 You, O king, gave the command that every man who hears the sound of the horn, pipe, zither, triangular harp, stringed instrument, bagpipe, and all the other musical instruments should fall down and worship the image of gold; 11 and that whoever would not fall down and worship should be thrown into the burning fiery furnace. 12 But there are certain Jews whom you appointed to administer the province of Babylon: Shaʹdrach, Meʹshach, and A·bedʹne·go. These men have paid no regard to you, O king. They are not serving your gods, and they refuse to worship the image of gold that you have set up.”</p>

<p>13 Then Neb·u·chad·nezʹzar, in a furious rage, ordered Shaʹdrach, Meʹshach, and A·bedʹne·go to be brought in. So these men were brought in before the king. 14 Neb·u·chad·nezʹzar said to them: “Is it really true, Shaʹdrach, Meʹshach, and A·bedʹne·go, that you are not serving my gods and that you refuse to worship the image of gold that I have set up? 15 Now when you hear the sound of the horn, the pipe, the zither, the triangular harp, the stringed instrument, the bagpipe, and all the other musical instruments, if you are ready to fall down and worship the image that I have made, fine. But if you refuse to worship, you will immediately be thrown into the burning fiery furnace. And who is the god who can rescue you out of my hands?”</p>

<p>16 Shaʹdrach, Meʹshach, and A·bedʹne·go answered the king: “O Neb·u·chad·nezʹzar, we have no need to answer you in this matter. 17 If it must be, our God whom we serve is able to rescue us from the burning fiery furnace, O king, and to rescue us from your hand. 18 But even if he does not, let it be known to you, O king, that we will not serve your gods or worship the image of gold that you have set up.”</p>

<p>19 Then Neb·u·chad·nezʹzar became so furious with Shaʹdrach, Meʹshach, and A·bedʹne·go that the expression of his face changed toward them, and he gave orders to heat the furnace seven times hotter than usual. 20 He ordered some of the mighty men from his army to bind Shaʹdrach, Meʹshach, and A·bedʹne·go and to throw them into the burning fiery furnace.</p>

<p>21 So these men were tied up while still wearing their cloaks, garments, caps, and all their other clothing, and they were thrown into the burning fiery furnace. 22 Because the king’s command was so harsh and the furnace was exceptionally hot, the men who took up Shaʹdrach, Meʹshach, and A·bedʹne·go were the ones killed by the flames of the fire. 23 But these three men, Shaʹdrach, Meʹshach, and A·bedʹne·go, fell bound into the burning fiery furnace.</p>

<p>24 King Neb·u·chad·nezʹzar then became frightened and quickly rose up and said to his high officials: “Did we not tie up three men and throw them into the fire?” They answered the king: “Yes, O king.” 25 He said: “Look! I see four men walking about free in the midst of the fire, and they are unharmed, and the fourth one looks like a son of the gods.”</p>

<p>26 Neb·u·chad·nezʹzar approached the door of the burning fiery furnace and said: “Shaʹdrach, Meʹshach, and A·bedʹne·go, you servants of the Most High God, step out and come here!” Shaʹdrach, Meʹshach, and A·bedʹne·go stepped out from the midst of the fire. 27 And the satraps, prefects, governors, and the high officials of the king who were assembled there saw that the fire had had no effect on* the bodies of these men; not a hair of their heads had been singed, their cloaks looked no different, and there was not
 even the smell of fire on them.</p>

<p>28 Neb·u·chad·nezʹzar then declared: “Praised be the God of Shaʹdrach, Meʹshach, and A·bedʹne·go, who sent his angel and rescued his servants. They trusted in him and went against the command of the king and were willing to die rather than serve or worship any god except their own God. 29 I am therefore issuing an order that any people, nation, or language group that says anything against the God of Shaʹdrach, Meʹshach, and A·bedʹne·go should be dismembered, and their houses should be turned into public latrines; for there is no other god who is able to rescue like this one.”
30 The king then promoted Shaʹdrach, Meʹshach, and A·bedʹne·go in the province of Babylon.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It is pretty silly. </p>

<p>People think it&#39;s a sign of respect when you stand. Even though not everyone standing even gives two shits for it. They just do out of habit, training, etc.</p>

<p>If it&#39;s something to do with military, I&#39;ll stand. If it&#39;s something somewhat important, I&#39;ll stand.</p>

<p>But if it&#39;s a ball game or something... Nah. I&#39;m comfy. </p>

<p>Besides. There&#39;s just something else about watching everyone else stand and perform while you&#39;re on the outside, looking in. It&#39;s neat to say the least.</p>

<p>I stopped standing at most pledges/anthems around middle school &amp; high school.</p>

<p>In elementary, there was no choice. We were lined up and watched to make sure we had our hands on our hearts, reciting everything. </p>
