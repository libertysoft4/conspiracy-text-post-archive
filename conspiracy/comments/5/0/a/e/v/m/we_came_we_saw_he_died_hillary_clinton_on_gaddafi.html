<p>I saw a news report where the journalists said that the vast majority of rebels that they spoke with cited Gadaffi&#39;s alleged Jewish heritage as the reason that they were taking up arms. Insidious.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yea I know!! He had his military gunning down protestors in the streets with helicopters!!</p>

<p>...according to one anonymous phone call to al jazeera that the MSM then ran with as if proven fact</p>

<p>And remember that time they found a giant mass grave of Gaddafi&#39;s prisoners!!!</p>

<p>....that turned out to be cattle bones (but only French media bothered to correct their story once this was discovered)</p>

<p>He was going to kill 100,000 of his own citizens!!!</p>

<p>....which was nothing but unproven hyperbole, but again the MSM ran with it as if it was a proven factual story</p>

    <div class="md"><p>And let&#39;s not forget that he used United Nations / NATO authority to launch the war, and far exceeded the 90 days limit of the War Powers act.</p>

<p>Surrogates told Congress to their face (twice) that the President didn&#39;t need their authority for military campaigns, he got it from NATO and the UN. And then on top of that, the UN resolution simply authorized the coalition to protect civilians. It in no way what-so-ever authorized a full on bombing campaign to effect regime change, one that killed thousands of the very civilians they were supposed to be protecting.</p>

<p>So I agree, I think it&#39;s one of the worst legacies (of many bad ones) Obama leaves behind.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is all you need to know about Hillary Clinton. Forget that she&#39;s an habitual liar. Forget that she was incompetent in her role as Secretary of State. Forget that she let men die at Benghazi when she could have saved their lives. Forget that she and her sex-addict husband are both crooks who have stolen millions from taxpayers through their crooked dealings.</p>

<p>All you need to know is that she laughed at the brutal torture and murder of another human being, a torture and murder that she herself caused.</p>

<p>She is at the very least a sociopath; quite possibly a psychopath. She enjoys the suffering and death of other people.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Contrast this with Putin’s reaction to seeing the actual video of Gaddafi’s death, as <a href="http://www.lrb.co.uk/v38/n01/seymour-m-hersh/military-to-military">reported</a> by Seymour Hersh:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>He also echoed a view held by some in the Pentagon when he alluded to a collateral factor behind Russia’s decision to launch airstrikes in support of the Syrian army on 30 September: Putin’s desire to prevent Assad from suffering the same fate as Gaddafi. He had been told that Putin had watched a video of Gaddafi’s savage death three times, a video that shows him being sodomised with a bayonet. The JCS adviser also told me of a US intelligence assessment which concluded that Putin had been appalled by Gaddafi’s fate: ‘Putin blamed himself for letting Gaddafi go, for not playing a strong role behind the scenes’ at the UN when the Western coalition was lobbying to be allowed to undertake the airstrikes that destroyed the regime. ‘Putin believed that unless he got engaged Bashar would suffer the same fate – mutilated – and he’d see the destruction of his allies in Syria.’</p>
