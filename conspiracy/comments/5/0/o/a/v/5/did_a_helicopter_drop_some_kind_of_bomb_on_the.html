    <div class="md"><p>no. The near freefall speed at which all 3 building fells mean that the bottom, middle and impact areas were all detonated at nearly the same time. What we are talking about here is premeditated set up through controlled demolition. that ensured the bottom was already collapsing when the top hit it. The craziest thing of all is WTC-7, not impacted by anything, yet fully collapsed for no apparent reason</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Knight is this the footage from THAT link at 3;50 you can hear at least 3 pops or so i think .....[shouldnt delete these folks gotta know even if they decide to disagree]</p>

<p>also what do you think happened to the top of the twinpins? not the antenae but the top that held the columns in place ... and why do you think there was so much thermal heat so many days later .... were we beamed or was it nukes in the basement?  and all those beams cut on v angles and 45 degrees what a coincidence...</p>

<p>lastly what melts steel to be molten [which of course they would never admit to] and there was definitely ash when i finally got back to nyc the next day i was on the first ferry with 3 girls who still had the ash all over them they had not yet been decontamiated [tho they had to go somewhere i think to be cleaned up ] and it was easily25 hours after the event and collaspse well 9ish in the morning they were covered the ferry ride was very somber ... </p>

<blockquote>
<p>why do you think there was so much thermal heat so many days later.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Actually my thoughts on that are non conspiracy. When each beam hit the ground, it rubbed against the others already there  causing friction to heat the pile more than anyone had ever seen before because that much metal had never fallen all at once before. </p>

<p>. Thousands of beams added heat to each other because of the friction among the beams and the total was enough to melt metal underground. </p>

<p>Some kind of secret weaponry disassociated  millions of the metal fastenings such as welds and bolts, all at one time, while it dissolved the concrete to dust.</p>

<p>I&#39;m thinking  the 3 girls you mention are probably dead by now.</p>

<p>this is what i think ... they beamed the towers from space that is why the top probably disintergrated</p>

<blockquote>

<p>this would be so sad they were just young twenty somethings who got caught up in you hafta come with us so they took them to new jersey [alot of folks it seems got evacuated to jersey but they would not evacuate me back to ny...so then in jersey they were kinda in a holding thing and then they were suppose to get decontaminated but that didnt work out so they were heading back to ny to go back downtown to get decontaminated sad all aroound that site smoldered for weeks ... we sat on the roof at port newark and watched all the activity from across the river but the winds tg were blowing over brooklyn [where all the hipsters are killing themselves to pay high rents ] for three days it blew south then it changed and blew north and went thru my apartment even on the east side  you could smell the air was so bad ...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>im glad to be talkin the the Knight... keeper of the koolest links</p>

<p>and even thereafter the 100 days there were building sites where like the financial  center i think when they were doing the structual repairs certain floors would start blazing [spontaneous combustion thats always their code to my thinking] where workers would still be dealing with fires even months and almost years later </p>

<p>plus the thing was we were on lockdown in newark see cuz that was THAT airport shipping area and my stupid boss decided that it would be better to grind the lemon grass and fill the order then leave when they said get out or you are on lock down til sunset.... so as these girls were covered in dust so was my boss and his two gringos covered in lemon grass honest truth [he was a spice dealer as the towers fell and this girl cheryl who i had only just met that day her mom called to tell us what was happenin i was doin a bank statement in like 5 different currencies andi was like half way thru  i just screened all the shit out to finish that sucker [it was like 5 pages] so menawhile this other guy came in from parking and was like one of the towers just had a plane fly in he was suppose to have been there earlier but he got distracted [yeah id say]] so then him and my boss went on the roof til the second tower collapsed they say the whole thing at that point i just wanted to go back to ny  so cheryl and me were driving around  honking the horn to get their attention meanwhile they were under a shoot to kill order right so like when they stopped us we were like i gotta get back to the city air vac me and they were like ladies you are lucky to be alive right get back to your biuilding and sit tight  why didny your boss evacuate with everyone else.... it was horrible sad tragic and martial restictive and i knew immediately this was us on us...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was far away, yelling at my TV, shouting  &quot;This isn&#39;t real, this is some kind of cartoon, This doesn&#39;t happen&quot; over and over.</p>

<p>Then everybody everywhere decided they were extremely patriotic. &quot;I&#39;m more of a patriot than you are,&quot; &quot;no you&#39;re not I am.&quot;</p>

<p>I didn&#39;t dare start looking into it for a couple of months but when I did a lot of the best info was still fresh. I went to Google Images, which was pretty  new at the time and did a search for images of the Pentagon. I got a lot of the 9/11 movements best images for them  from that search and made sure people saw them. Here&#39;s one  very few have  seen though.</p>

<p>Look for a line across the lawn on this satellite image made on September the 7th 2001.4 days before the attack.</p>
