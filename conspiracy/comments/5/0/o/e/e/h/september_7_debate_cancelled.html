<p>Hence the problem with the two-party system. And even if Stein and Johnson were included, both have platforms that are not far from their bigger, two-party opponents. The GP and LP should have better, stronger candidates that adhere to their party beliefs <em>NOT</em> pander to the voters to increase their chances for a vote.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>After thoroughly reading the leaked emails, I believe the &quot;confused&quot; remark does bear further investigation.  I would like to know what she really meant by this.  </p>

<p>The rest of the leaks like the secretaries schedule is just poor judgement, but I also believe many officials in dc behave in the same manner.  </p>

<p>And for her aide (who I would do proper btw) interceding to get someone a visa, I think that&#39;s a privilege of the job.  Is it aboveboard?  No. Not at all. It just understates clintons behavior.  Shitty, but just shy or criminal ( in the eyes of the doj). It&#39;s as if they won&#39;t arrest her in a &quot;technicality&quot; that would land others in prison.  She clearly has pull in the FBI and doj.  She is just untrustable at best and a criminal at worst.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The U.S. Code of Federal Regulations strictly limits the granting of diplomatic passports to members of the Foreign Service, their family members, or those working on U.S. government contracts. According to 22 CFR 51.3:</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A diplomatic passport is issued to a Foreign Service officer or to a person having diplomatic status or comparable status because he or she is traveling abroad to carry out diplomatic duties on behalf of the U.S. Government. When authorized by the Department, spouses and family members of such persons may be issued diplomatic passports. When authorized by the Department, a diplomatic passport may be issued to a U.S. Government contractor if the contractor meets the eligibility requirements for a diplomatic passport and the diplomatic passport is necessary to complete his or her mission.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hmm. I know systems built on poor grounding eventually collapse, but then a stronger one replaces it so I have hopes for that. It doesn&#39;t have to come to collapse if the people take everything in their own hands but that would mean actually coming together with a united vision. </p>

<p>I live in Los Angeles.</p>

<p>People here have everything in their own hands, to be sure.  Most folks here have their dicks in one hand, very little in the other.</p>

<p>Time is short, man.  Go have an amazing meal, sex or whatever it is that might bring you happiness.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Lol. As far as transition... If people suffer too badly they will learn to swim. Basically, if Rome falls the people will splish splash until they learn to swim and of course many could be hurt in the process. </p>

<p>Idk. I&#39;m game to unite with the people and move now but not sure how to yet. I don&#39;t want to see economic turmoil in this country anymore. </p>
