<p>Woe to you who are complacent in Zion,
    and to you who feel secure on Mount Samaria,
you notable men of the foremost nation,
    to whom the people of Israel come!</p>

<p>Go to Kalneh and look at it;
    go from there to great Hamath,
    and then go down to Gath in Philistia.
Are they better off than your two kingdoms?</p>

<p>Is their land larger than yours?
You put off the day of disaster
    and bring near a reign of terror.</p>

<p>You lie on beds adorned with ivory
    and lounge on your couches.</p>

<p>You dine on choice lambs
    and fattened calves.</p>

<p>You strum away on your harps like David
    and improvise on musical instruments. </p>

<p>You drink wine by the bowlful
    and use the finest lotions,
    but you do not grieve over the ruin of Joseph.</p>

<p>Therefore you will be among the first to go into exile;
    your feasting and lounging will end.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Wow the corresponding Bible verse is a trip.</p>

<p>Book of Amos, Chapter 6:
Woe to the Complacent</p>

<p>6 Woe to you who are complacent in Zion,
    and to you who feel secure on Mount Samaria,
you notable men of the foremost nation,
    to whom the people of Israel come!</p>

<p>2 Go to Kalneh and look at it;
    go from there to great Hamath,
    and then go down to Gath in Philistia.
Are they better off than your two kingdoms?
    Is their land larger than yours?</p>

<p>3 You put off the day of disaster
    and bring near a reign of terror.</p>

<p>4 You lie on beds adorned with ivory
    and lounge on your couches.
You dine on choice lambs
    and fattened calves.</p>

<p>5 You strum away on your harps like David
    and improvise on musical instruments.</p>

<p>6 You drink wine by the bowlful
    and use the finest lotions,
    but you do not grieve over the ruin of Joseph.</p>

<p>7 Therefore you will be among the first to go into exile;
    your feasting and lounging will end.
The Lord Abhors the Pride of Israel</p>

<p>8 The Sovereign Lord has sworn by himself—the Lord God Almighty declares:</p>

<p>“I abhor the pride of Jacob
    and detest his fortresses;
I will deliver up the city
    and everything in it.”</p>

<p>9 If ten people are left in one house, they too will die.</p>

<p>10 And if the relative who comes to carry the bodies out of the house to burn them[a] asks anyone who might be hiding there, “Is anyone else with you?” and he says, “No,” then he will go on to say, “Hush! We must not mention the name of the Lord.”</p>

<p>11 For the Lord has given the command,
    and he will smash the great house into pieces
    and the small house into bits.</p>

<p>12 Do horses run on the rocky crags?
    Does one plow the sea[b] with oxen?
But you have turned justice into poison
    and the fruit of righteousness into bitterness—</p>

<p>13 you who rejoice in the conquest of Lo Debar[c]
    and say, “Did we not take Karnaim[d] by our own strength?”</p>

<p>14 For the Lord God Almighty declares,
    “I will stir up a nation against you, Israel,
that will oppress you all the way
    from Lebo Hamath to the valley of the Arabah.”</p>

<p>Footnotes:</p>

<p>Amos 6:10 Or to make a funeral fire in honor of the dead</p>

<p>Amos 6:12 With a different word division of the Hebrew; Masoretic Text plow there</p>

<p>Amos 6:13 Lo Debar means nothing.</p>

<p>Amos 6:13 Karnaim means horns; horn here symbolizes strength.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>They always launch from a launchpad at KSC, and never launch from a barge - they land the used first stage on a barge (and twice back to the Cape) so that they can re-use it, which is a pretty amazing feat.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Just letting you know, there is no way on this earth that the footage of the moon landing was pre-recorded. So you have to either believe they did it all <em>live</em> and broadcast it as they &#39;faked&#39; it...which...for a &#39;top level government conspiracy&#39; seems awfully risky, or actually went to the moon.    </p>

<p>Don&#39;t forget, the live broadcast wasn&#39;t the odd 10 second clip you see on conspiracy sites....it was like fucking 2 hours long, on TV.....they didn&#39;t have the technology at the time to have recorded that footage to then re-broadcast....so....yeah.    </p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;LOL! Nah.&quot;    </p>

<p>Please explain then the technical specs of how they broadcast over 2 hours of the moon landing on national TV then? I don&#39;t think you quite grasp the basic physical photographic concepts which make recording it <em>literally impossible for the time</em>. That means you believe they did it live, with the astronauts walking around super slowly to simulate the low gravity.........    </p>

<p>Lets look at the one where they talk some shit about &#39;adding the flag in afterwards&#39;, <em>HOW EXACTLY DO YOU DO THIS AT THE TIME?</em>, we didn&#39;t have computer graphics and CGI at the time, they would&#39;ve have to have been added <em>onto the fucking film</em>, do you even understand how photographically this is quite literally <em>impossible</em> in the late 60s? You now not only have to get around the whole &#39;its impossible they recorded over 2hrs of this then overcranked for slowmo&#39;, you now have to explain fucking modern-day CGI somehow being added to the mix...........<em>in the fucking 60s</em>. All you have shown by linking those pages, is that you know absolutely nothing about photography, film, the physics of light and shadow or videography, and especially not about the photographic technology available at the time, you seem to think it was shot in 2016 and then ported back in time to air on tv in the 60s.    </p>

<p>The exact same way they broadcast over two hours on earth.</p>

<p>Being on fucking earth.</p>

<p>Should i bother asking you about the technical specs of how they broadcast over 2 hours of the moon landing, on the moon?</p>

<p>NASA deleted it all, by accident, that is the answer to my question.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>....So you are saying they did it <em>live</em> on earth, for over 2hrs? Seems risky for such a top level conspiracy don&#39;t you think? And....you&#39;re saying that as they did it live, they also walked around slowly/weirdly to simulate the lesser gravity of the moon then?    </p>

<p>You do know they <em>could not have</em> recorded it on film, and then broadcast it at the length/fps they did....right? It wasn&#39;t *photographically or technically feasible in the late 60s....    </p>

<p>You could always go google the camera they used? It was a <em>live fucking broadcast on the moon</em>, doing it live on earth means you have to explain the movement from having less gravity, as well as explain why the fuck they would do it fucking <em>live</em> on earth....the risks would be absolutely enormous. All you have proved so far is that you know absolutely nothing about how film works, how television broadcasts work or the actual technology of the late 60s available to photographers? Please watch the video and explain how they got around his points.</p>

<p>No they didn&#39;t, you are misinformed.  There are many of the original tapes remaining from the other Apollo missions.  The &quot;missing tapes&quot; only applies to one of the missions.</p>
