        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I&#39;ve changed the name of this club to help save face of others who got caught up in this trap.  I&#39;m not going to reveal anything that was said in private to me, so don&#39;t worry.  I&#39;ve changed the name of the club and I&#39;m not mentioning any names.</p>

<p>I was invited to mod over a month ago to join this club on reddit.  I didn&#39;t know anything about it, so I asked the mod team here and they basically said &#39;we don&#39;t know, why don&#39;t you join and find out&#39;.  I joined out of curiousity, but I was precarious that it was a masonic hangout trying to rope me in or track me.  Being the intrepid adventurer, I thought, sure, maybe while they are trying to dupe me I can learn something from them, and most certainly, I did.</p>

<p>I want to share with you my lessons learned.</p>

<p>First of all, as some of you who also joined (about 20 of us), I declared myself an antimason from day 1.  I knew that others on this sub might accuse me of being a masonic hangout and, well if you think that then maybe you&#39;ve not read my posts,  especially those super-fun battles between me and tyler-zoro over pike&#39;s morals and dogma.  I&#39;ve studied the masons, quite a lot.  I blame them for 9/11.  If they aren&#39;t, then they need to explain their fingerprints all over it and give me a story that makes sense.  That&#39;s just what it is for me.  And I&#39;ll leave that, at that.</p>

<p>So during this time on griffinclub, many of us were like, &#39;what are we doing here?&#39;, some getting quite rude, aggressive about not knowing why we were there (but justifiably so).  We were hoping it was a coordinated investigation of masons, since most of us had that inkling.</p>

<p>Never got an explanation that made sense.  Something about &#39;when the time comes and we have enough people, we will open up the trap door to hell&#39;.  I didn&#39;t like this answer.  Was something I expected from my neighbors pot smoking 17 yr old (nothing against pot btw).  So I gave an ultimatum of &quot;you better tell us what this is about by EOD friday&#39; and posted it for all to see.  </p>

<p>Well, instead of getting a response, when I returned to the site, <strong>all</strong> the messages were removed, including mine.  It would seem that the leader swept house.</p>

<p>Frustration!</p>

<p>Then there was a post that was intended to coordinate us towards one goal.  And that goal was to commit a crime.  Plain and simple.  What they wanted us to do was to commit an actual conspiracy against a business in the defense industry.</p>

<p>So I said something like, &quot;Nope!  I&#39;m out&quot;  And I left the sub and left moderatorship.</p>

<p>This whole thing has confirmed my suspicions that there are people here trying to bait others into committing crimes.  Problem is, we are not criminals.  We are investigators.</p>

<p>And any of you shills, agents provocateur, honeybasterds had better take notice because the US Marshalls service can deputize and I&#39;ve got a right mind to ask them to give me a badge for some very interesting RICO evidence I have that points in your direction.  I know you&#39;re laughing and high fiving at this but your time will come.</p>

<p>To everyone else, I&#39;d say this: be on the lookout for people asking you to step over a line.  Not only don&#39;t do it, don&#39;t ever talk to them again.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is probably how they recruit the idiots that we see on the nightly news buying fertilizer from an undercover agent to put in his van, or buying firearms to commit some act. Of course, I mean the rare few times when they don&#39;t completely manufacture the threats themselves, they bait otherwise innocents into doing something incriminating so they can brag on the nightly news about them thwarting another terror plot. It&#39;s to make us feel like our billions spent on the phony war on terror are actually making us safe. So they troll conspiracy websites and look for individuals who want to help, and tell them they&#39;re joining some Fight Club type group or something, and before they know it their face is on CNN with a headline that reads &quot;Homegrown Terror, ISIS in America.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Fascism would be extremely welcome over what we have now. What we have now is a system that was devised to bring out the worst in both men and women, poor and rich, intelligent and stupid -- they have socially engineered us to be constantly fighting eachother and to hate and feel a constant dissatisfatction with life. Fascism is a very distinct thing, and I just learned this yesterday, but it is not what most people think it is. Look up the Fascii. Bundle of sticks tied together with a rope. Fascism is the system that believes that like the sticks, people are stronger when together. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>thanks for sharing!  i agree that this is going on.  imo, likely driving actors include industry, mil, gov, po, and actual anarchists.  engaging with them is a great way to inadvertently get urself in shit, unless you&#39;re doing it for trolly fun. </p>

<p>I figure a good rule of thumb is - don&#39;t damage shit.  try to improve things.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks and high five back.  I&#39;m glad people are starting to have faith and trust in each other again. That&#39;s what&#39;s going to win it.  I really do see an awakening, and not just in this community (I could see how some would argue that this sub is a &#39;filter bubble&#39;).  But others out and about who don&#39;t even really know what reddit is--they too are seeing the disgrace of our justice system.  Heck I even spent the afternoon of the comey hearing before congress at the mechanic, watching it intently with 6 others and everyone was on point.  I mean this kind of engagement in tv news was similar to 911 itself or the challenger explosion.</p>

<p>Anyway, you can go to that sub and see what they were trying to do, but the wording has since changed iirc.  It looks a lot tamer than I recall it being, maybe he wrote it badly initially, who knows.  I just know that it read like trying to drum up a psyop and I was not into that.  I&#39;m an anti-psyop person.  I think manipulating people in this way is evil and it&#39;s a psychopaths game.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>A while back I had considered making a script to save all the content from a small private sub I was a part of. It ended up being deleted before I had a chance to write the script, but does this seem like something that would have been useful?</p>

<p>The initial idea was not for provenance, I just wanted a local copy of some of the thing I and others had written, but for this or similar instances, it might be. Archive.is won&#39;t work, as you can&#39;t get it to record from a private sub (to my understanding), but it would be possible to screenshot and upload to imgur all contents of a sub, particularly a smaller private one. </p>

<p>Is this worth making?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I had received an invitation to join that club earlier this month, even though I only PM&#39;d a link to the creator of the sub regarding a website I thought he would find informative. Didn&#39;t inquire about joining the group. Later received a reply from him and an invitation to join. Didn&#39;t join though, because I realized before receiving his reply that the purpose of the group was less benign than I originally thought. When I first stumbled upon the subreddit it seemed plausible reading the posts on there that the group wanted to &#39;fight back&#39; somehow against TPTB. When I later read through more of the comment history for most members of the group, it really stuck out how shifty and mysterious the sub creator was when interacting with other members. I do appreciate how you called out the sub creator on there 911body, helped me reach my conclusion about the group.</p>

<p>Things like the &#39;Eye of Horus&#39; logo, &#39;Exercise One&#39; with the goal of dishonestly persuading others that Northrop Grumman is the real controller of the world (or something like that), and none of the members knowing what the overall purpose of the group was were red flags I shouldn&#39;t have first ignored. I&#39;m assuming SphinxClub is just a honey pot. I dunno how 20 recruited strangers on the internet can actually build a convincing but false case that a defense contractor controls the world, even with a lot of assistance from whomever is running the group. </p>

<p>Some folk in DC tried to siege the sub on Anthony (BroS/ TheAmericanPharaoh/digitalcartel4ever) and get him demodded, but he had an alt higher up that remodded himself. I got deleted as a mod from both. </p>

<p>I feel like maybe they are some multidimensional aspect of christ consciousness, but that

    <div class="md"><p>A while back I had considered making a script to save all the content from a small private sub I was a part of. It ended up being deleted before I had a chance to write the script, but does this seem like something that would have been useful?</p>

<p>The initial idea was not for provenance, I just wanted a local copy of some of the thing I and others had written, but for this or similar instances, it might be. Archive.is won&#39;t work, as you can&#39;t get it to record from a private sub (to my understanding), but it would be possible to screenshot and upload to imgur all contents of a sub, particularly a smaller private one. </p>
