<p>I have heard that reddit founder Aaron Swartz &#39;committed suicide&#39; a month after he had access to the truth behind Sandy Hook (<a href="http://aangirfan.blogspot.com/2013/01/jewish-hero-aaron-swartz-exposing-elite_16.html">http://aangirfan.blogspot.com/2013/01/jewish-hero-aaron-swartz-exposing-elite_16.html</a>)</p>

<p>But when I google &quot;Sandy Hook hoax&quot; all I see is articles debunking it and &quot;factchecking&quot; it. All of the articles mention several different hoaxes, and are not giving me much information, so I don&#39;t know specifically which theories I should research.</p>

<p>So I apologize if this is a stupid question, but what is the general r/conspiracy consensus on Sandy Hook?</p>

<p>I mean there&#39;s lots to it, but nobody ever saw any evidence of dead kids.

The DNA results are somewhat mysterious (<a href="http://www.abovetopsecret.com/forum/thread1012004/pg1">http://www.abovetopsecret.com/forum/thread1012004/pg1</a>). There&#39;s the weird interviews of the parents and law enforcement and the coroner. The whole thing is completely fucked up.</p>

<p>Oddly, it wasn&#39;t the principal&#39;s fingerprints but a convicted felon&#39;s DNA (and none from Lanza). Heres a good post about it with links to the forensic report <a href="http://www.abovetopsecret.com/forum/thread1012004/pg1">http://www.abovetopsecret.com/forum/thread1012004/pg1</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m aware of the felon DNA. But it wasn&#39;t on the weapon or ammunition; it was on an envelope found in the Lanza home. I believe it held a greeting card... ? Can&#39;t really care to look it up because I don&#39;t think it&#39;s relevant. The person who posted that it was found on the .22 ammunition is mistaken. Hopefully it was an innocent mistake. Look at the wording in the actual report:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The DNA profiles from items #3G1 (swabbing -- both sides of the envelope flap) and <strong>#4-2S2</strong> (swabbing - .22 caliber cartridges) were searched against the Connecticut and National DNA Databases. On January 7, 2013, a hit was obtained with the Convicted Offender DNA profile from New York State Police Investigation Center DB #NY10011106A (see Hit Notification dated 01/18/2013). <strong>No matching profiles were found for item #4-2S2.</strong></p>

<p>Item #4-2S2 was the bullet and no matching profiles were found. No felon DNA on the bullet.</p>

<p>So, they found Adam Lanza&#39;s DNA on the stock &amp; barrel of the .22 rifle used to kill Nancy Lanza. They couldn&#39;t find it on the handle area, or anywhere on the Bushmaster used at the school, or on the car door handles, or on the envelope they found at Lanza&#39;s, titled &#39;To the young children of Sandy Hook Elementary School&#39;.

<p>No, this is incorrect. Please see my post above: the felon&#39;s DNA was <em>not</em> found on the cartridges.</p>

<p>They found Adam&#39;s DNA all over the Glock, the Sig Sauer, and the shotgun (which was found in the car). I&#39;d start with document 00146690, which is the lab report.</p>

<p>In regards to the Bushmaster, his DNA was found on the forearm of the weapon. That&#39;s in the supplemental DNA report. 00122616.</p>

<p>NEUTRAL RESULTS – BILLS DEFEATED</p>

<ol>
<li>     SB 1054.  AN ACT CONCERNING THE DISCLOSURE OF AUTOPSY REPORTS.</li>
</ol>

<p>SB 1054, in its original form, proposed direct changes to the General Statutes governing records of the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner (“Chief Medical Examiner”), to prohibit the Chief Medical Examiner from disclosing the autopsy report, scientific findings and records of its investigation and examination of a child whose death was caused by an apparent homicide, if nondisclosure was requested by a parent or guardian.  At the Judiciary Committee hearing on this bill, the FOIC as well as the Chief Medical Examiner himself testified that this bill is unnecessary because there are already adequate safeguards built into current law to prohibit almost all disclosure of medical examiner’s reports and scientific findings.  The bill came out of committee in revised form adding to the list of exemptions in the FOI Act for law enforcement records compiled in connection with an investigation to include records of a medical examiner’s investigation and examination (e.g., autopsy reports) in the apparent homicide of a person under 18 years of age.  Notably, this proposal would not change the existing safeguards built into the current law.  The bill died on the Senate Calendar.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That changes the narrative significantly, in my opinion. Certainly it&#39;s difficult to argue premeditation if it was done a year later.</p>

<p>You don&#39;t believe that&#39;s a reasonable reaction the shooting? Please keep in mind that this was a direct response - from the parents - to Michael Moore, who suggested that the autopsy reports and related materials should be made public in order to illustrate the horrors of gun violence. Do you believe that to be unreasonable or suspicious?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>But it failed. This is the same theory that requires people to believe the school was closed in 2008, in preparation for this event. Yet they waited until 2011 to try and pass a law to seal autopsy reports, and then couldn&#39;t even get Dr. Carver - the CME, who was allegedly in on it - to support it? Come on, man.</p>

<p>The bill had very little support until after the shooting. Furthermore, this type of law is not exclusive to Connecticut. California has a similar one, for instance.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Nullify its existence? I&#39;m not saying that the bill didn&#39;t exist, only that it failed to pass (true) and couldn&#39;t even garner the support of a man conspiracy theorists believe plays a key role in the coverup (also true). Carver believed that the bill was redundant because autopsy photographs were already barred from public release altogether and autopsy reports were already exempt from FOIA requests. But these reports <em>were</em> disclosable only through the office of the CME (Dr. Carver). That&#39;s what this bill attempted to change. Again, since Carver was allegedly in on it, why would they need a bill that prevents him - someone complicit in the alleged hoax - from releasing the reports? It makes zero sense.</p>

<p>Furthermore, you do know that the Sandy Hook shooting is not the only major crime to have ever taken place in Connecticut, right? One of the major driving forces behind the bill was Dr. William Petit, whose wife and two young daughters were raped and murdered during a home invasion. You can read about it <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cheshire,_Connecticut,_home_invasion_murders">here.</a> Petit wanted to keep those reports private, for very obvious reasons.</p>

<p>Yea I do know about the Petit case and its relevance, but it means nothing in the grand scheme of things. If you wanted such a bill passed you&#39;d be silly not to attach it to a specific case and have someone like Petit genuinely promote it.

    <div class="md"><p>I never claimed it - &quot;it&quot; being the bill - didn&#39;t exist before the event. The <em>law</em> absolutely did not exist before the event, as you originally claimed. Because the bill failed. Again, it didn&#39;t even receive the support of Dr. Carver. Connecticut State law <em>already prevented</em> autopsy photos and reports from being released to the public, unless approved by the office of the CME, that being... Dr. Carver. The bill nonsense is a red herring.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>That&#39;s ludicrous. Of course it doesn&#39;t &quot;mean nothing&quot;. It provides a very real incentive for the bill, rather than the imagined one presented by conspiracy theorists. Suggesting that Petit was <em>used</em> in an attempt to give this bill some gravity is completely unfounded and kind of offensive to the guy.</p>

<p>Technically, they&#39;re not even the same bill. Two sections were added to the 2013 bill, as a direct result of the shooting. Those two additions looked to prevent the release of autopsy photos (again, already prohibited in the state of Connecticut) as well as &quot;audio tape or other recording where the individual speaking on the recording describes the condition of a victim of homicide, except for a recording that consists of an emergency 9-1-1 call or other call for assistance made by a member of the public to a law enforcement agency&quot;. Keep in mind that the Sandy Hook 911 calls <em>were</em> released.</p>

<p>Now those two items were <em>not</em> included in the 2011 version, much of which is completely irrelevant, at least as it pertains to Sandy Hook. Why look to block the release of juvenile arrest records? Why prevent the release of the name and address of sexual assault victims? Much more relevant to the Petit case. More importantly, why - if the entire government was involved in the planning and coverup - didn&#39;t they pass the bill into law? You&#39;re grasping at straws here. You want there to be something more here, and you&#39;re attempting to fit a square peg into a round hole.</p>

<p>But the actual content is different. The 2013 version has been expanded quite a bit in order to be more relevant to Sandy Hook. The 2011 version is of much less relevance.</p>

<p>You believe that a failed 2011 bill (a bill which in part addresses the release of juvenile arrest records as well as the names and addresses of sexual assault victims, such as Dr. Petit&#39;s wife and children) is somehow tied to the Sandy Hook shooting, which took place a year later. I don&#39;t. Is that your main gripe? Because pretty much everything else in your original post ended up being factually incorrect, likely because you saw it in a spooky YouTube video and failed to actual do even a cursory level of research on your own.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>The bill being passed the year after the event is not a coincidence. It was directly influenced by the event. There is a more than casual connection. It is the exact opposite of a coincidence. As for the version of the bill that existed in 2011, its mere existence would be cited by conspiracy theorists as proof of something sinister whether it appeared a year earlier, five years earlier, or ten years earlier. The fact of the matter is that autopsy reports were not publicly available even before the bill was proposed. The bill simply attempt to prevent the office of the CME from releasing them. Furthermore, Lenny Pozner has actually released Noah Pozner&#39;s postmortem examination; a document which would be illegal to forge. <a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-tGKwXpkSLEA/U6Ih5yu_jjI/AAAAAAAAAmA/pBOlCnfdZTo/s1600/noahpoznerpg2.jpg">Here is the second page,</a> which documents his injuries.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>In this sense, you are at odds with 99.9% of all Sandy Hook deniers, most of which believe implicates essentially the entire United States government, going all the way up to Obama. I would love to hear you explain how hundreds of pages worth of documentation, including statements from hundreds of witness (including members of the Newtown police, Connecticut state police, the FBI, etc), could have been generated without their participation. This idea - logistically - is even harder to swallow than the idea that everyone was involved. Just who, exactly, perpetrated this alleged enormous, sprawling fraud without raising the suspicions of those in government?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Okay fair enough, I mostly agree with you. But to answer your last question, I obviously don&#39;t know, but let&#39;s say (just to use an example) that the CIA did it. Now how many people would need to know about it? Not as many as you seem to think. </p>

<p>If children did die at Sandy Hook, and it was a false flag, then the shooter(s), and just a handful of other people with direct involvement (a thin trail leading to the top) would need to know about it. Nobody else would need to be informed of the exact details. </p>

<p>If children didn&#39;t die at Sandy Hook, and it was a hoax, then those who said to have seen the bodies would have to be in on it, along with the handful involved in direct planning. </p>

<p>That is why compartmentalization and different levels of classification exist within organizations. You&#39;re allowed to know <em>x</em>, but you aren&#39;t allowed to know <em>why</em> x, because you don&#39;t have clearance. And even though you only know <em>x</em>, you&#39;re still obligated to secrecy.</p>

<p>As for the government  - it certainly doesn&#39;t have to be directly involved. An organization (known or unknown to the public) can activate an event, and the government only needs to know what &quot;happened&quot;, and what policy is in place for dealing with such a crisis. Obama isn&#39;t going to go personally tour a crime scene - Obama just needs to know that a school shooting happened (he may or may not know it was a false flag), and that gun control is important. In this sense I&#39;m not arguing that the government is innocent, only that they aren&#39;t directly involved. And if they are involved, again it could be very few of them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If the theory you choose to believe involves real children actually dying but being killed by someone other than Adam Lanza (which is certainly more believable that the alternative, more popular theory in which no one died, though no less reprehensible) then yes, that circle of co-conspirators shrinks significantly, but still involves a fair amount of people. I know it&#39;s been attributed to a few different people at this point - most famously Benjamin Franklin - but there&#39;s a saying: &quot;Three people can keep a secret, if two of them are dead&quot;. It also presents a laundry list of logistical issues. For example, if your argument is that the 2011 version of the autopsy reports bill (can&#39;t recall the number or the full name and am too lazy to look it up) is an act of premeditation, not only are the authors of that bill now included in that circle of co-conspirators, but if the children were actually murdered, why would the autopsy reports need to be kept private (which, as I&#39;ve established, they already were)? There would be nothing to hide. Most conspiracy theorists (incorrectly, since they&#39;ve never been public) argue that the autopsy reports are being held under lock and key because they prove that no one died.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah... I heard they left a decent paper trail of people moving into the surrounding area and then back out after the shooting. But if you believe that the upper levels of the government would be the ones pulling these kinds of shenanigans then you gotta figure these people might have all been agents with fake identification. </p>

<p>I watched 9/11 live on TV back in the day so I saw the MSM making their mistakes and have been skeptical ever since... and still the media can fuck with my head and make me later second guess what I&#39;ve seen, or &quot;make&quot; me forget things they said. So don&#39;t feel bad if you didn&#39;t jump out of your seat and yell &quot;Conspiracy!&quot; when you saw this happening on TV. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>From what I read, many of the people who lived in the areas morgages were paid off by the govt. maybe a incentive to keep quiet? Some crisis actors as well. Children who were supposed to have been killed were seen alive after. News reports at the time of multiple people being taken into custody at the crime scene, then I think it ended up being just once guy?</p>

<p>Idk what to believe honestly.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Conspiracy theorists get a a piece of info and then put out a video or post it somewhere without looking into it more.  then it gets spread around as fact.  That&#39;s the problem with all conspiracy theories.</p>

<p>Some Newtown homes had a $0 sale price,  so naturaly people jumped on it and said the Gov paid off their houses.  But if you look into it,  it is explained.  </p>

<p>This is from a real estate site ion 2011,  explanations for the $0 home price:</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yea that was a shitty unsourced comment by me. I hope people know to do their own research like you but of course many don&#39;t. </p>

<p>Oddly, it wasn&#39;t the principal&#39;s fingerprints but a convicted felon&#39;s DNA (and none from Lanza). Heres a good post about it with links to the forensic report <a href="http://www.abovetopsecret.com/forum/thread1012004/pg1">http://www.abovetopsecret.com/forum/thread1012004/pg1</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>But it failed. This is the same theory that requires people to believe the school was closed in 2008, in preparation for this event. Yet they waited until 2011 to try and pass a law to seal autopsy reports, and then couldn&#39;t even get Dr. Carver - the CME, who was allegedly in on it - to support it? Come on, man.</p>

<p>The bill had very little support until after the shooting. Furthermore, this type of law is not exclusive to Connecticut. California has a similar one, for instance.</p>

<p>There&#39;s no puzzle here. At least not in the sense that most conspiracy-minded folk want there to be.</p>
