    <div class="md"><p>It was 2 guys that had the most popular thread on <a href="/r/pizzagate">/r/pizzagate</a> for 2 days. They started cracking when being pressured by the community for real evidence, kept postponing proof, talked about sharing 2gb of encrypted files that they supposedly stole from inside some pizza shop they claimed was being used for child trafficking. Constantly changed their story and backtracked, avoiding answering any real questions. Then they said the cloned the pizza shops hard drives and were going to share the torrent of the encrypted hard drive. Over the course of two days they led the community on a wild goose chase, then apparently posted real CP. I&#39;m not saying you have to believe it&#39;s fake, but everyone, including the the most prominent investigators/researchers came to the logical conclusion that they were either shills trying to get the subreddit shut down, or larpers just leading everyone on. Feel free to find the post here in the pizzagate archives and come to your own conclusions. But I watched it all unfold over two days, and personally believe it was fake as well.</p>
