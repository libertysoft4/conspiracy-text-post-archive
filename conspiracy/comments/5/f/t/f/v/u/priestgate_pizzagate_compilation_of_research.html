        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>&quot;All pizza leads to rome&quot; is currently a stickied post of mine.  But I want to note that others have done much better research than myself on this area, specifically those in <a href="/r/romerules">/r/romerules</a> who have really driven this research for a long time now and deserve to get much more recognition for the research done in this area.</p>

<p>I believe the most important things to understand about this is that Obama has been constellated by Jesuits in his National Security Council and Trump is being latched upon by the same cretins.  These aren&#39;t good folks.  Read their oath at the library of congress and they say they will murder women and their unborn children for heresy.  It&#39;s not good.\</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I do further promise and declare that I will, when opportunity presents, make and wage relentless war, secretly and openly, against all heretics, Protestants and Masons, as I am directed to do, to extirpate them from the face of the whole earth; and that I will spare neither age, sex nor condition, and that will hang, burn, waste, boil, flay, strangle, and bury alive these infamous heretics; rip up the stomachs and wombs of their women, and crush their infants&#39; heads against the walls in order to annihilate their execrable race. That when the same cannot be done openly I will secretly use the poisonous cup, the strangulation cord, the steel of the poniard, or the leaden bullet, regardless of the honour, rank, dignity or authority of the persons, whatever may be their condition in life, either public or private, as I at any time may be directed so to do by any agents of the Pope or Superior of the Brotherhood of the Holy Father of the Society of Jesus. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t know why it&#39;s so hard to understand for many people.  (not saying you) </p>

<p>But literally for hundreds of years freemasons and other satanic organizations have been trying to destroy the Christian faith from the inside out.  And ya,  catholics are the biggest.  And who knows, now it&#39;s even possible that the whole top rank has been infiltrated but the show must go on.  I have knowledge from priests about this, they themselves don&#39;t know who to trust all the time.  Many play double agent, catholic by day satanist by night.  One of the higher priests has said that it seems that there are more freemason priests now in the catholic church then others.  (my parish including) </p>

<p>I have also had 2 drunk freemasons from high ranking positions in the catholic school districts talk to me how they play both sides of the debates and try to eliminate the Bible from the schools.  People love to spill secrets when they are hammered, specially when they think you&#39;re in their side The battle is on all levels. </p>

<p>Satanist do this, and they do it very well. Doesn&#39;t matter what sect they do it to.  </p>

<p>That&#39;s not true, the freemasons <a href="https://archive.org/stream/pdfy-oIjQy_ojFlaaM5zL/Oath-of-Knights-of-Malta_djvu.txt">join the jesuits by oath</a> in the honorific knighthood degrees of freemasonry 33<sup><sup>o</sup></sup> and above in the upper orders like knights of malta, knights templar, royal arch masonry etc. </p>

<p>This idea of infiltrating / reinfiltrating, etc.  each to the other may have been true but is no longer.  It&#39;s been about the jesuits infiltrating both.  <a href="https://webbrain.com/brainpage/brain/A4276BA6-CF6E-8995-4C91-9ED993EC7D98/parent/com.thebrain.webbrain.pages.clientsupport.BrainFullPage#-1">Ancient Gnostics / Templars now fully transformed into mystery babylon controllers of the Catholic Church with Jesuit Pope Francis at the top:</a> they&#39;ve taken over both the traditional church and the masons.  It&#39;s now one big hierarchy under the Jesuit order--game over on any spy v spy stuff.</p>

<p>Remember the freemason faux doc the &#39;protocols of the elders of zion&#39; scapegoating &#39;the Jews&#39;?  Well it was based on an older jesuit text, it plaigarized and replayed--originally it was <a href="https://webbrain.com/brainpage/brain/A4276BA6-CF6E-8995-4C91-9ED993EC7D98/parent/com.thebrain.webbrain.pages.clientsupport.BrainFullPage#-904">the secrets of the elders bourg-fontaine</a>, suggesting either they&#39;ve been copying each other&#39;s playbooks or they&#39;ve been coordinating towards a common goal all along.</p>

<p>So maybe you and I are saying the same thing, only I&#39;m saying, the &quot;takeover&quot; is done,...it&#39;s complete  as of 3/13/13</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not sure.  I think they would sign that because they are psychopaths and it enables them to have a reason / justification to carry out their psychopathy.  In this way, Jesuitism corralls and therefore monitors and manages psychopaths.  </p>

<p>This plus they give people promises of power and a framework whereby their misdeeds will be protected.  Similar to how the freemasons will say &#39;oh lord oh god is there no help for the widows son&#39; in court and they will get a get out of jail free card because all the judges are masons</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It is a little unnerving to think there are that many people walking the earth that messed up in the head. So, in your opinion, are all Freemasons evil? I ask, because I have a long time friend that is a mason, and I have a hard time believing he has a sinister bone in his body. Maybe he is a mason out of family tradition or legacy? I have never asked him directly.</p>
