        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>FULLY exposed worldwide first by Last Prophet Matt:</p>

<p>Most members of secret societies controlled by the illuminati don&#39;t know who their Supreme Leader is.<br/>
No wonder: most members of the illuminati don&#39;t even know the basic fact about the illuminati leadership.</p>

<p><strong>Illuminati Leadership is NOT a committee but ONE person, accordingly to the absolute pyramid principle.</strong><br/>
As for the Wikipedia references: Keep in mind that the &quot;encyclopedia of the age of the internet&quot; is TOTALLY controlled by the illuminati.</p>

<p><strong>Leadership of organizations</strong><br/>
An organization is a social entity that has a collective goal and is linked to an external environment.<br/>
Two basic types of leadership for any organization:<br/>
1. ONE person alone, the Leader. This again has two subtypes, Supreme Leader or not:<br/>
a) Leader himself gets orders from another organization.  Examples:<br/>
- Army/Airforce/Navy&#39;s Commander-in-Chief gets orders from the Commander of the Armed Forces who himself gets orders from the President/King/prime-minister;<br/>
- Catholic Chruch&#39;s Bishop leading the clergy of a particular area gets orders from Bishop leading a larger area who gets order from a Cardinal leading a larger area who gets orders from the Pope.<br/>
b) Leader obeys himself alone: Catholic Chruch&#39;s Pope; President/King/prime-minister of a sovereign state.<br/>
2. A GROUP of people, where decisions are taken according to some set of rules.</p>

<p><strong>Secret societies</strong><br/>
A secret society is a club or organization whose activities, events, and inner functioning are partly or totally concealed from non-members.<br/>
The society may or may not attempt to conceal its existence.
What Wikipedia conveniently forgets to mention: same as for the armed forces, large secret societies are also based on the pyramid principle.<br/>
The degree to what things are ALSO concealed to each member depends on how high in the pyramid he is.</p>

<p><strong>Secret societies with political aims</strong><br/>
Wikipedia ignores the illuminati, mentions freemasonry and adds:<br/>
- &quot;they are illegal in several countries.&quot;;<br/>
- Poland mentioned as &quot;where any secret political parties and political organizations are banned in its constitution&quot;.<br/>
Reality:<br/>
- the few countries where freemasonry in supposedly banned (Iran, Saudi Arabia, North Korea) are all ruled by illuminati puppets. In other words, the ban is nothing but illuminati theater.<br/>
- Poland, controlled by the illuminati long before 2004, is no longer formally a sovereign state.<br/>
One of the reasons is &quot;coincidentally&quot; because its constitution is meaningless since 2004, when the traitors of 25 former countries signed the EU constitution.<br/>
Reminder: per definition citizens can obey ONE and ONLY ONE Constitution.<br/>
Poland is now merely an EU states, having also lost the other two pillars of national independence: own currency and border&#39;s control for capital, goods and people.<br/>
As for the illuminati no wonder it&#39;s ignored.<br/>
Reminder: in the dedicated page Wikipedia continues to deny the existence of the illuminati, although now Google returns four times more results for illuminati than for freemasons.</p>

<p><strong>Sects</strong><br/>
The word sect is used with two different contexts.<br/>
1. A subgroup, offshoot of a larger religious group.<br/>
2. Organizations that demands from its members:<br/>
a) - to restrict contact with non-members;<br/>
or/and<br/>
b) - to consider non-members as inferior to the members of the sect, what can go as far as to deny their human condition (untermensch or human cattle).<br/>
The more weight a) and b) have the more sectarian the sect is.<br/>
Although it&#39;s from this context that the word sectarian originates, Wikipedia censors this second and most important meaning.</p>

<p><strong>Illuminati sect</strong><br/>
No wonder: the illuminati is not only a secret society with political aims but also as sectarian as it gets in the untermensch sense.<br/>
Reminder of the first commandment of the Illuminati religious sect: the light bearer, Lucifer, created only two basic types of people: we, the illuminati, and the human cattle, good for nothing but to be enslaved, mocked and slaughtered. </p>

<p><strong>Illuminati secret society ruled by ONE Leader alone</strong><br/>
Almost all secret societies are ruled by a Supreme Leader. And that is the case for ALL religious sects.<br/>
In other words: The Illuminati secret society or ORDO ILLUMINATUS is NOT ruled by a GROUP but by ONE person alone, the Grand Master. </p>

<p><strong>Secret societies controlled by the illuminati</strong><br/>
Any of these secret societies does NOT deny its existence:<br/>
- ritualistic societies from all-Yale Skull &amp; Bones to all-male Bohemian Grove (members may supposedly invite guests to the encampment) and masonic lodges whose official members include talking heads served by mass media.<br/>
- &quot;discussion of issues of global concern&quot; societies like the Bilderberg Club and Trilateral Commission.   </p>

<p><strong>Who is the Leader of each of these societies?</strong><br/>
For ritualistic societies Illuminati&#39;s Wikipedia avoids the question for Skull &amp; Bones or the Bohemian Grove but gives it for the oldest masonic lodge in Continental Europe, the Grand Orient de France.<br/>
As for the Bilderberg Club, the answer is served as illuminati joke: there are as many members as leaders, the seven Chairmen of the Steering Committee.<br/>
The members are portrayed as simple participants in the yearly conference.<br/>
Who the leader is in fact a non-question.<br/>
No difference from the unknown leader of Skull &amp; Bones to Jean-Michel Quillardet, the official Great Master of the Grand Orient de France.<br/>
ALL &quot;leaders&quot; get orders directly or indirectly (through another high rank illuminati member) from the Illuminati supreme leader.</p>

<p><strong><em>Notes</em></strong><br/>
(1) Wikipedia on Secret societies<br/>
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secret_society">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secret_society</a></p>

<p>(2) Wikipedia on secret societies with a political aim:<br/>
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secret_society#Politics">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secret_society#Politics</a></p>

<p>(3) How things changed in 15 years - Illuminati replace Freemasonry as most widely referred secret society in the web:
Until this millenium, when someone referred to a secret society with political goals it had almost always with freemasonry to do.
As 1998 Last Prophet began exposing the illuminati in the &quot;Kosovo conflict&quot; and &quot;Clinton impeachment&quot; CNN forums the information about the illuminati on the web resumed to a few sites part of the illuminati web of disinfo.<br/>
All those sites had only a few visitors a day except for illuminati-news, supposedly managed by a &quot;swedish truth seeker&quot; and used to discredit the truth by associating it with UFOs &amp; Co.<br/>
Countless disinfo sites started &quot;exposing&quot; or &quot;debunking&quot; the illuminati later, from radio-host Alex Jones to the History Channel and Hollywood films.<br/>
Yet at the end of the day all these illuminati productions use the same basic types of diversion (from &quot;evil jews are in control&quot; to &quot;aliens are among us&quot;) to self-discredit some of the truth they serve. </p>

<p><strong>BASICS</strong><br/>
OBEY YOURSELF ALONE: The HISTORY of Illuminati religion&#39;s MOST mystifying commandment, has three documented chapters:<br/>
- 1762 by Jean Jacques Rousseau<br/>
- 1883 by Friedrich Nietzsche<br/>
- 2013 by the current Illuminati Supreme Leader.<br/>

<strong>Father of current LEADER of Illuminati</strong><br/>
Accordingly to the official story, the father of the current LEADER of the Illuminati was half-german and already at least 37 years old when he changed:<br/>
- his last name from [H _ T _ _ _ ] to [H _ _ _ T _ _ ];<br/>
- added a middle name, meant to be used attached to his new last name, that sounds exactly like the official last name of the current illuminati leader.</p>

    <div class="md"><p><strong>Mother of current LEADER of Illuminati</strong><br/>
The official story about the mother of the current LEADER of the Illuminati:<br/>
- her birthdate is not precised and given only by an expression that once you Google it returns as first result the wikipedia page about the current illuminati leader;<br/>
- although she was officially german, her first name is english and both her family names were the two most common french first names at the time.<br/>
- JEAN, the first of those two french names, is actually the first name of the most famous role interpreted by the current illuminati leader.<br/>
This officially makes the current illuminati leader of 75% german descent.<br/>
However in his role in politics as &quot;Dr. Ron Paul&quot; he is officially &quot;87.5% of German descent&quot;.</p>

This is more characteristic crazy fear monger attitude. Just pushing your own opinions, and calling everyone sheep without even understanding them. This is a major douchey way to act, and hardly enlightening, or leader-like.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Correct, that is the current illuminati Supreme Leader&#39;s FATHER.<br/>
It doesn&#39;t take a rocket scientist to get how Alexander Adolf Hitler&#39;s (named after his great uncle, &quot;coincidentally&quot; not only the leader of the III Reich but also the illuminati Grand Master at the time) alias was chosen: using the middle part of his father&#39;s name - Patrick Stuart.<br/>
Not a surprise at all a classical shakespearean actor would be writing the final chapters in the script of simulated reality alias world as the human cattle knows it.<br/>
Note: before deciding that &quot;the years don&#39;t match&quot;, keep in mind that history is written by the victors (i.e. Wikipedia, textbooks). Those same sources will also tell you &quot;Angela Merkel&quot; is not the biological youngest daughter of Adolf Hitler, &quot;Hillary Clinton&quot; is not the older half-sister, and he&#39;s not &quot;Kevin Spacey&quot;&#39;s father.</p>
