<p>Yes, you can. What you mean is that you can not (surgery notwithstanding) change your <em>sex</em> (male/female). &quot;Sex&quot; and &quot;Gender&quot; aren&#39;t automatically the same thing. Sex is what you are born as. Gender is who you identify with. Gender is a <em>social</em> construct - not a biological one.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This separation between the word &quot;Gender&quot; and the medical term &quot;Sex&quot; is illogical. That is the real conspiracy. The two have always been associated together. It is your sex that is designated at the bathroom, we also refer to this as your gender. See how that works? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Why do we have a special word for what someone believes they are?</p>

<p>Like for example:</p>

<p>&quot;Sex&quot; describes whether you were born male or female.
&quot;Gender&quot; describes whether you identify as male or female.</p>

<p>&quot;Race&quot; determines what race(s) you were born as.
&quot;_______&quot; determines what race(s) you identify as.</p>

<p>&quot;Age&quot; determines how many years your body has existed.
&quot;_____&quot; determines how many years you feel your body has existed.</p>

<p>And so on. It&#39;s like &quot;gender&quot; has become the nice way of saying &quot;delusion&quot;, and it doesn&#39;t seem like the truly humane thing to do, to encourage someone delusions. We don&#39;t do that with the mentally ill, or people who have dementia. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t think people who suffer from dysphoria should be treated like crap or anything, there are all sorts of psychological issues people have, there is no reason to treat people with that type dysphoria any differently. </p>

<p>But there has been a very strong, pervasive cultural push to no longer be encouraging/supportive of people with dysphoria to explore where those feelings come from, and eventually be able to accept themselves and their bodies. Instead the push has become to encourage/pressure these people to lie to themselves, become self-deluded and for everyone else to go along with it.</p>

<p>We are told that this is the &quot;right&quot; and &quot;nice&quot; thing to do, but I&#39;m not really sure of that.</p>

<p>That, I think, is the whole problem. &quot;We are told&quot;...People are either lazy or scared or not intelligent enough (more likely a combination of the three) to not think for themselves. They are thus easy to convince of <em>anything</em>. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It just seems to me like it&#39;s meant to take advantage of these people. </p>

<p>If I don&#39;t care about someone, and I just want them to shut up and go away, then I could tell them whatever they want to hear, to make them shut up and go away. Then I don&#39;t have to deal with them or their feelings. </p>

<p>But if I actually care about and respect someone, then I am going to tell them the truth, even if it means I have to deal with their emotions and such. They are worth it to me, to &quot;deal&quot; with them.</p>

<p>Dysphoria is usually caused by trauma of some sort, whether it is psychological/emotional trauma where the person&#39;s sex was targeted, or something like sexual abuse. These people are usually victims and they are hurting, and their dysphoria is a severe symptom.</p>

<p>And it just seems to me like certain government/political groups are trying to take advantage of these people. Tell them what they want to hear, discourage them from actually recovering, and use them as pawns. </p>

<p>That is why it bothers me.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Listen closely. When you put a murderer in jail are you telling him how to live his life? Because he didn&#39;t kill me? Is that an argument? No it&#39;s not. And neither is saying a mom has a right to kill her unborn child, because it doesn&#39;t affect me. Morals aren&#39;t dependent upon who is affected by them. The principle is that society has a right to regulate and decide who is in or out of that society. Murderers? Might be ok in the mafia, not so in most people&#39;s ideal society. </p>

<p>Point is most people will never be persuaded by your argument that &quot;it doesn&#39;t effect you shut up!&quot; Because they instinctually know a person with fucked up morals when they see one. And they pure and simple don&#39;t want them in their society. It doesn&#39;t need to have a personal effect on them.

    <div class="md"><p>This whole aspect of it is what confuses me the most - it&#39;s seemingly way more of a thing now for younger kids (even as young as elementary school) deciding they want to be a different gender. </p>

<p>I can&#39;t decide if it&#39;s now just &quot;more accepted&quot; now and thus more prevalent or if it&#39;s become more prevalent because MSM and the entertainment industry want to talk about it every 6 seconds. </p>

<p>Personally inclined to believe the latter. I once read a story about a ~10 year old starting to do the &#39;hormone therapy&#39; pills or whatever they are to start the transition process. That&#39;s a hard thing for me to fathom. Kids are still learning, developing and changing so much all of the time at that age, and for several years to come. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah I don&#39;t get it either. I don&#39;t know what the fuck is going on these days. I can tell you it&#39;s not because &quot;gender is fluid,&quot; as they would have us believe. If that was the case, this transgender trend wouldn&#39;t just be popping up now in the last decade.</p>

<p>As far as kids going into transition? That&#39;s bullshit, and needs to be stopped. It&#39;s one thing for a mature, competent adult to make that decision. But something wholly different for an 8 year old. Just because a boy plays with dolls does not mean he identifies a girl, or even has the mental faculties to understand what the fuck that means.</p>

<p>I do think talking to kids about these things at a young impressionable age in school is largely responsible for this trend. This was the problem with the D.A.R.E. programs in the 80&#39;s and 90&#39;s. They conducted studies that found kids exposed to the program were more likely to use drugs than those not exposed to it. The idea being, if you don&#39;t know something exists then you don&#39;t seek it out. I think the same can be concluded with this trans trend. If kids aren&#39;t taught that gender is fluid then the likelihood that a boy today will decide to be a girl tomorrow is significantly reduced, I would think.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>some kids are male and have a hormone disease where they don&#39;t have enough testosterone so they identify with being a female, same with a girl who has not enough estrogen, those hormones decide sex.

    <div class="md"><p>I get what you&#39;re saying, but if that were accurate to what is happening we would be seeing a different trend right now.</p>

<p>For example, you say male hormone deficiency leads to identifying as female. Ok, I get that. Then why the fuck aren&#39;t they fixing the deficiency? Why are they making it worse? Oh you&#39;re a boy with a hormone deficiency. Here, take some hormones that make you more of a girl. It doesn&#39;t make any sense. Truth is, this isn&#39;t about hormone deficiencies. </p>

<p>If all of this were about hormone deficiencies, we would not be talking about women using the mens room, gender reassignment surgeries, etc. We would be talking about hormone deficiencies and CORRECTING them. But that&#39;s not what society is talking about. Instead we&#39;re debating about gender being &quot;fluid&quot; and how it can change day to fucking day based on how you fucking feel that day after eating breakfast! It&#39;s fucking nonsense.

    <div class="md"><p>And that is totally cool with me. If an adult male goes to the doctor, finds out his hormones are all messed, and decides to not do anything about it, then fine. Whatever.</p>

<p>What bothers me, is when its a child/teenager. By giving that child the wrong hormones the doctors/parents are causing tremendous harm that has consequences unforeseen. And we know the human body continues to develop until the mid 20&#39;s. Personally I think anyone that wants any gender altering remedies prior to age 25 should be denied. If you still want to chop it off after that, then go for it.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Determining how many transgender people there are in the U.S. has been challenging for a number of reasons, but a new study from the Williams Institute estimates that there are approximately 1.4 million of them — twice as many as were previously estimated. <a href="https://thinkprogress.org/the-american-transgender-population-is-larger-than-we-thought-it-was-ab83126f33a#.tdhgfkuob">Source</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Then google that <a href="http://williamsinstitute.law.ucla.edu/research/census-lgbt-demographics-studies/estimates-of-transgender-populations-in-states-with-legislation-impacting-transgender-people/">source</a> number. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Noting that younger adults ages 18 to 24 were more likely than older ones to say they were transgender, researchers said that the new estimates reflected in part a <strong>growing awareness of transgender identity</strong>(&lt;--Tumblr). <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/01/health/transgender-population.html">Source</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Then be blown away that they really are less than .06% of the population and possibly even half that based on a inflated number by confession. A number that&#39;s based on the growth of &quot;awareness&quot;(They are talking about people who are coming out) aka <em>social media</em>. </p>

<p>It&#39;s all media hype bullshit with a hand full of legitimate transgenders who are now felling ostracized and having there voices stolen by certifiably deranged people. If you just look at the platforms its being pushed on. Tumblr, Face book, Reddit, NYP, every fucking news network. These are all tools of the establishment. </p>

<p>One in four males are psychopaths and we are not even bringing in the female persuasion. <a href="http://www.livescience.com/16585-psychopaths-speech-language.html">Source</a> I believe this to be the answer for the large surge of new transgenders. They fit the bill. A bunch of &quot;look at me&quot; and &quot;my way or the highway&quot; cunts in regards to all but a hand full popular transgender channels on youtube. I see it as the Tumblr culture is spilling over.</p>

<p>Plus with the government getting involved and states recognizing new gender laws. No doubt in my mind its all a psyop. Even the LGBT want to remove the T from LGB for being absolutely insane. Need I say more? I honestly feel terrible for those who truly are transgender and then have to deal with people like this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/RoryDeganRepresent">cunt</a> and this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUVw1pPsTCQ">dick bag</a> pilfering money on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOxyjvOAmwM">there</a> legitimate cause.</p>

<p>Either way live your life the way you want. But don&#39;t fuck with me or were going to have problems. Like me being your boss and you showing up defining your new gender based on whatever the fuck is trending on tumblr this week. Ain&#39;t no one got time for that bullshit. I don&#39;t pay based on gender I pay based on performance. Your gender has nothing to do with 99% of the job market. </p>

<p>And I haven&#39;t even touched the gorilla in the room regarding doctor assisted transgender mutational and suicides rates thereafter. Which slides into other mental disorders regarding gender dysphoria. A known and scientifically proven disorder. </p>

<p>I&#39;m also not a fan of hormone use. Shit literally can cause you to mirror actual disorders like <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/attention-please/201310/hormone-imbalance-not-bipolar-disorder">bi-polar disorder</a>.</p>

<p>In summary it all reeks of TPTB jumping on the social the media uprising on Tumblr and spinning it the max to the point were a minority so tiny that they dont even equate to a single percent end up have massive changes forced on the majority. Its the classic divide et impera to enact laws from which you can expand on. Just got to get your foot in the door.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Definitions of categories in science are used to classify.    If you can&#39;t classify and abstract reality into meaningful subcategories,  then you cannot perform the method of science,  you cannot conduct meaningful comparisons.    So,  from a scientific point of view,  the categories and definitions of science are in fact,  based on observations from the world.</p>

<p>Efforts to make the issues of gender vague and the categories meaningless are based on the effort of one group to convince another group to go along with newly created categories.    The question is whether those new categories are real,  or whether  they are make believe.    Or whether they are newly created categories.    Historically,  the category of eunuch was a newly created category,  one which could be verified and enforced based on observation.     These days,  make up, a change of wardrobe,  name change, behavioral patterns etc. are proposed to serve the same purpose.    Either way,  its still a new category.    <strong>Those in the original category can rightly object that the criteria of their category is being changed in its criteria/significance/meaning</strong>,  that the ambiguity thus created is socially disruptive without sufficient cause.    Ultimately society can agree to change its agreement on the matter or not.</p>

<p>Legislation will have to be based on new classification criteria that can be objectively verified.   If lab tests are involved,   then the state will also have to certify the new statuses with specific state sponsored documentations and identification systems,  as noted on a person&#39;s ID,  etc.   Until these matters are resolved,  the status of those making gender claims not in compliance with older traditions is tenuous.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>As someone who has actually taken Anthropology and Sociology courses I&#39;m not so sure that you understand what gender is. Gender is a cultural construct related to the traits we call <em>Masculine</em> and <em>Feminine</em> and is what leads to people being placed into certain roles. Sex on the other hand is the biological distinction.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Dozens of experts in the fields of Anthropology and Sociology would tell you the same. Any number of sources on the internet would do so as well. Though there are also a number of conspiracy theorists that would refute this, such as elderly conservatives or religious fundamentalists who think that morality is under attack. </p>

<p>The real crux of the matter is that humans still don&#39;t fully understand the brain, so it&#39;s difficult for us to be completely certain as to what is and isn&#39;t biological. For now, science defines gender and sex as being distinct. In a few decades a new discovery might be made that proves this false. Until then, it&#39;s important for us in these professions to use the correct terminology.</p>

<p>Anyways, I don&#39;t claim to be an expert on the matter at hand and will respect your opinion for I&#39;m not an ardent proponent of transgender identity. Sorry if I came off as antagonistic. All I&#39;m saying is that this aspect of life is a complicated issue with no easy answers - while judging it based on previous methods may be simple and safe we must be willing to accept the possibility that what we think to be evident in life was actually false.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You can do what you want to your body but it is not a right to shove it down people&#39;s throats and force everyone to accept as normal and courageous. Go take a look at the suicide rates of people who are trans. It&#39;s a psychological disorder. It is not courageous. It is not a right to force people what to think about your self mutilation. You don&#39;t see me seeking protection from people dissing on white heterosexual males. Equal rights allows people to be offensive and be offended. It&#39;s no longer equal if you make some groups able to say and think what they want and limit others outside of that group from saying certain things. I don&#39;t care if you wanna do shit like that, you have that right, and I have the right to think and say what I want about it. Just as you may say what you want about my choices. That&#39;s freedom. And isn&#39;t it great ? It fosters real learning. Real honest exchange of ideas. Even if it hurts, it&#39;s better than being muzzled and forced to believe what the media says is acceptable. We are all people and we all have the right to approve or disapprove of anyone elses actions. </p>
