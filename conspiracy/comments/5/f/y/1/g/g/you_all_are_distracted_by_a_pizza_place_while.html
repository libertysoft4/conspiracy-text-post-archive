        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>If I were a betting man, I&#39;d say that there are strings being pulled to keep you guys distracted from what&#39;s real and actually happening.  The Clintons &amp; Co have done some shady things, but this pizzagate thing is batshit and a designed distraction to keep your focus away from cabinet nominations.  Here are some gems:</p>

<p>Sec of Treasury - Multi-generational Goldman Sachs banker from a Rothschild banking family.</p>

<p>Sec of Commerce - Trump&#39;s bankruptcy bailout buddy who was former Rothschild banker.</p>

<p>Sec of Ed - Betsy DeVos, who wants to dismantle public education and is Erik Prince&#39;s sister.  Mike Pence is good family friends with the Prince&#39;s, so expect favorable situations for whatever Prince is calling Blackwater these days.</p>

<p>National Security Advisor: wants to increase domestic spying and literally thinks he&#39;s in a modern crusade and will enact any policy to fulfill his vision.</p>

<p>I&#39;m really disappointed in this sub this past year.  I&#39;ve been in it since it&#39;s founding and while it&#39;s always been about 50-60% bullshit, there were some good nuggets of truth hidden in here.  Since the election kicked into high gear last year, this sub has had so much disinfo it&#39;s not even funny.  We&#39;ve had a massive influx of new people who are beginning to look at things critically for the first time and they are having more disinfo shoved in their faces than any of us old timers ever had.  I&#39;m sure people who have been here for a while remember what a trip the first year is when you start thinking with the assumption that news you hear can be false or a purposeful distraction.  It is difficult and you don&#39;t know what to grasp on to at first, so it&#39;s an intellectually vulnerable time.  So we need to be more tuned to the distractions and keep our eyes on what&#39;s really happening.</p>

<p>Edit: Sharing a fun song to lighten the mood:  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EodiBQ845_s">B. Dolan - The Reptilian Agenda</a>  (though David Icke&#39;s Reptilian conspiracy may be one of the, if not most crazy mainstream ones.  Except for that nautical law flag conspiracy claiming everyone is owned by the queen because our birth certificates have capital letters and flags in courts have gold frillies on them)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Exactly. Politics don&#39;t change, not everyone fell for the trump card, and it&#39;s absolutely obvious to the researcher that elite pedophilia is taking place on a global scale and has been for a long time.

    <div class="md"><p>I haven&#39;t seen a single solid shred of evidence for pizzagate.  There&#39;s just a bunch of circumstantial coincidences that perhaps indicate that further investigation is warranted, but there&#39;s nothing real yet.  Just because a bunch of people from the_donald and 4chan are going nuts over it doesn&#39;t make it true.  And they are using the same techniques that Hillary supporters were using to attack anyone that questiomed their retarded narrative.  Just like the neo-McCarthyism anti-Russian propaganda coming out of the neo-liberal camp is bullshit, this pizzagate narrative coming out of the right is also utter horseshit.  I challenge anyone to provide evidence other than &quot;code words&quot; or hanging out with pedophiles or any other circumstantial speculation.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah I kind of feel like the opposite is happening. The appointments are being railed by the media and of course nothing is being reported on the allegations and shady behavior in response to the pizza investigations.  The appointments don&#39;t mean shit and some people probably think they are great! However if you think pedophilia rings are great than you&#39;re probably involved and obviously a demented person. </p>

<p>Appointments won&#39;t shock the world because it&#39;s Trump. Confirming or exposing this on a grand level will infuriate the masses.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Is your goal to infuriate the masses?</p>

<p>I would think the goal of an investigation into an alleged international pedophilia ring would be to save countless numbers of children from sexual assault and/or worse, and putting the people responsible behind bars.</p>

<p>And these appointments do actually mean a lot. First off, these are the guys that are going to be setting the course of our country for at least 4 years, and quite possibly the next few decades (SCOTUS appointments). Secondly, Trump&#39;s appointments go against every campaign promise that he made, which suggests his entire campaign was as much of a con as all the rest.</p>

<p>Less shocking than a pedophilia ring? Sure. Does that mean it shouldn&#39;t be discussed on this sub because &quot;pizzagate&quot; is clogging up the place? I have to agree with OP on that one.</p>

<p>Ya&#39;ll are being distracted, and it&#39;s pretty blatantly intentional. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Keep the focus on the circumstantial evidence of a grandly disgusting and disturbing worldwide ring of unprovable conspiracy, and don&#39;t let them discuss the same conspirators openly maneuvering right in front of their face.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You either clearly havent taken a look at the evidence, or you do not have the ability to &quot;connect the dots&quot; when you&#39;re investigating a topic. Pizzagate is built upon mounds and mounds of damning circumstantial evidence, that no rational person could ever deny after taking an honest, non-partisan look. (You mentioned trump, so you already tried to politicize the topic when the pizzagaters consist of members of all political parties and points of the spectrum). </p>

<p>Honestly I&#39;m kind of surprised with some of the people who have simply brushed pizzagate off as hogwash or try to promote it as a wacky theory, especilly HERE on <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>. Isn&#39;t that what this forum is for? If you&#39;re the kinda guy who has taken an interest in conspiracy theories enough to frequent this board, I&#39;d think you would have the ability to analyze topics objectively and consider everything before coming to a closure on your beliefs, right? An &quot;Outside of the Box&quot; type thinker. Then why are so many here trying to blow us off or get us to stop investigating? I would think that the claim of a human trafficking network being run by some of the worlds most prominent world leaders and politicians would not be something I could simply &quot;brush off&quot;. </p>

<p>Obviously you&#39;re here to push the &quot;Pizzagate is a Psy-op&quot; narrative and try to lead us down bunch of goofy rabbit holes and politicize the whole thing, but seriously, maybe 5-10% of the stuff you guys do and the shit you post goes completely ignored. Just another stupid comment ya skip over. The people on this board are smarter than you think.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Perhaps you ARE right. But no rational person can dispute that pizzagate came up at an incredibly opportune time for the opponents of ONE candidate.</p>

<p>Even while BOTH candidates have proven and documented relationships with the actors involved. Jeff Epstein anyone?</p>

<p>This should set off alarms all over the place. Pizzagate may well be legit. But it is also being used to hide other shit that Trump&#39;s handlers do NOT want people thinking about.</p>

<p>Get off your fucking horse and think about it. This is PERFECT bait for us. And too many of us are taking it full on and ignoring the obvious Rothschild and Soros involvement in the Trump administration.</p>

<p>That admin is being built in front of our eyes. And it could affect the world for decades.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m seeing a well coordinated and agressive movement to censor any information that comes from this investigation. First they branded it with the &quot;Fake News&quot; label, Washington Post, Columbian, New York Times all ran hit pieces on Pizzagate in unison, Reddit DELETING r/rpizzagate less than 20 days in, the head guy &quot;Spez&quot; admitted to editing peoples comments, Alefantis deletion of his Twitter photos and set to private, All of the businesses sharing the plaza with Comet changing their pedophile logo&#39;s on their signs, and of course &quot;Twittergate&quot;, where this guy who leaked a bunch of pedophilia accounts on Twitter had his account removed. The mainstream media and social media are both involved in this stifling of information.</p>

<p>It&#39;s an almost DESPERATE attempt by them to keep things underwraps, I just find it hard to believe that they wouldn&#39;t be running full blast trying to cover this stuff up and manipulate the information and send the media lap dogs at us if it was a &quot;distraction&quot; or &quot;psy-op&quot; . It seems like a genuine attempt by them to try and nip this in the bud and muzzle it, and I just can&#39;t believe that they would put in that kind of effort with a psy-op.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Look, it&#39;s not like topics are just flying through the front page of <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> faster than we can read and discuss. Honestly this forum is pretty slow. <a href="/r/WikiLeaks">/r/WikiLeaks</a> and <a href="/r/DNCleaks">/r/DNCleaks</a> have been REALLY slow since the changes. Got something you think is important to discuss? Bring it on, we&#39;ve got the eyes and the time for it, collectively. It doesn&#39;t have to be one or the other. That is the flaw in the concern troll ointment. Don&#39;t sell us short so quickly. We can investigate leaked e-mails and wonder about Assange&#39;s safety all at the same time. We can keep an eye on Trump and investigate possible organized crime at the same time too. Go ahead and do your part, keep us honest. If you want to talk about distraction, take a look at <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a>.</p>

<p>Regarding the current topic: I&#39;m not sure what to think sometimes. There has been such a back-and-forth of misinformation and surprises surrounding Trump&#39;s cabinet. I am of course extremely curious to see how everything turns out, but I can&#39;t quite shake the feeling that something is going on behind the scenes. It shouldn&#39;t take too long to find out what side he&#39;s on once he takes office. Until then, Clinton financiers are furious and I would guess extremely dangerous during this transition. </p>

<p>My main advice is to remain calm and keep a focused watch on all factions involved until the next major development.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Everyone who didn&#39;t vote for Trump knew he was going to do these things.</p>

<p>Most who did vote for him probably thought this is what Clinton was going to do.  I wonder how many of them are able to connect the dots and realize they got scammed by Trump (not defending HRC, because her loyalties are clearly with money and the power elite).</p>

<p>Anyone who thinks either the Democrats or Republicans are going to enact policies that benefit the greater populace are asleep and until we spend a lot of time and effort to create other viable political parties, who have candidates on ballots for every electable office, at every level of government, we are going to keep getting screwed from the left and the right.</p>

<p>People are afraid to vote for 3rd parties en masse because it &quot;guarantees the other side wins&quot;, but it&#39;s the only way to begin to break the vicious cycle that is two-party American politics.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I do think it&#39;s possible.  </p>

<p>However, businesses should pay their fair share of taxes and should provide certain benefits to workers if they net a certain amount of income (net, not gross).</p>

<p>Allowing business to operate in countries with cheap (er) labor erodes the American working class almost as much as it takes advantage of the foreign workers.</p>

<p>Any company operating from the U.S.A. should have to maintain the same labor standards as America.</p>

<p>Allowing businesses to exploit tax loop holes, take advantage of countries with cheap labor/reduce operational costs, and lobby our government to make laws in favor of business at the expense of the general citizenry is not &quot;being pro-business&quot;, it&#39;s stealing from the general population to make a few business executives wealthy.</p>

<p>In my mind, once a company nets a certain amount of income, there should be no laws making things easier for that business, so that smaller business is encouraged and supported.  The laws applying to Monsanto should not be the same as the laws applying to Sally&#39;s Cupcakes (a made up small business).</p>

<p>At this point, you can easily have lots of pro-labor legislation that will not hinder or prevent small business from succeeding, but will not give advantages to the very largest companies, which do not need any help if they net a certain amount of revenue.</p>

<p>So, defining what &quot;pro-business&quot; actually entails is really the discussion we should have.</p>

<p>Holy cognitive dissonance, Batman.  First of all, there is absolutely zero evidence that these individuals &#39;defected&#39; from Soros.  Secondly, there is absolutely no reason Trump needed to accept someone who is so heavily connected to the establishment.  There are countless other qualified individuals that he could have selected, and yet he chose not to.</p>

<p>Why would they defect from Soros? It just doesn&#39;t make sense.  The far more likely explanation, based on Trumps other appointments, is that they did not defect at all and Trump has just been misrepresenting his stance on working with the establishment.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m honestly curious whether or not people saying PizzaGate is a psyop have done research into who is involved in the Clinton Foundation. </p>

<p>PizzaGate is not just about Comet Pizza and code words. In fact, let&#39;s take those out of the equation for the sake of this discussion.</p>

<p>OP, have you personally done extensive investigative research starting on a specific group (like the Clinton Foundation) and <em>not</em> starting from the code words/comet pizza? It&#39;s pretty incredible the links you yourself can connect by starting a fresh investigation with open eyes. The Clinton Foundation is one example. With a fresh investigation started by you and you alone - I&#39;d be really surprised if you told me nothing about The Clinton Foundation and who is involved brings up any sort of interest. Forget what people on Reddit say, forget &quot;sources&quot;....take some good hard time and research anything you&#39;d like involving the CF or any branch of government your heart desires. </p>

<p>I look at the wikileaks/PizzaGate investigation as an opener to something that goes much deeper and can all eventually be linked together without even the need for Comet Pizza and code word links.</p>

<p>Don&#39;t get me wrong; I highly believe disinfo is constantly getting pushed at us and I do think they are trying to use PizzaGate against us. Have you ever noticed the same &#39;ol info graphics or huge long posts made to expose &quot;normies&quot; to this are always the same? Constantly talking about one pizza place&#39;s Instagram, creepy bands that play there, and name meanings. It&#39;s pushed so heavily because just concentrating on those things alone makes the entire investigation look &quot;bat shit&quot; as you say. Throw in a tad of truth mixed with some Alex Jones-esque nuttiness and VOILA! The whole investigation is now &quot;disinfo&quot;. Meanwhile, real hard truths digging into the CF and branches of government are downvoted beyond hell or scrubbed entirely from the internet. Can you maybe understand that they are merely pushing the very tip of the iceberg because of how absurd it looks, and therefor &quot;debunk&quot; the entire process?</p>

<p>As far as Trump cabinet picks go - I do see these discussions on this subreddit constantly. It&#39;s been pretty out in the open. I know The_Donald may seem like a bunch of nutters with their heads in the sand, and some of them are as those people exist pretty much everywhere. However, don&#39;t think for a second that Trump supporters aren&#39;t keeping their eyes open. We are well aware and Trump will be closely watched by all, including his &quot;fans&quot;, <em>as soon as he is in office</em>. This doesn&#39;t mean we aren&#39;t watching his picks closely - but we also know we have no idea what his exact plans are. Having hope and wearing blinders are two completely different things. </p>

<p>You also have to remember as well just how many Trump supporters are aware of the government pedophile ring. I think it would be a pretty poorly thought-out psyop to reveal all this as a distraction from Trump; because if that were the case we would be the first ones to turn if we found out he was implicated in any of this and hiding it. Government pedophile rings are not new, but what is new is how many people are aware now and we can&#39;t turn back time - people aren&#39;t just going to forget and let it slide under the rug. Unless that is, you&#39;re one of the people that just don&#39;t believe the government is implicated in any pedophile rings whatsoever. And to that I&#39;d be at a loss as what to say.</p>

<p>TLDR: Only certain crazy sounding links are pushed and okay&#39;d by the Internet masters as to tarnish the true investigations. We have no idea what Trump&#39;s long game plan is. By all means, please investigate both on your own terms and come to your own conclusions without any hand holding.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>First time poster on this sub so bear with me here. </p>

<p>I&#39;m young, only 20, and this past year and a half after being show the truth of how things work has been absolutely insane. So much shit thrown at me, not knowing what I should or shouldn&#39;t believe, but I definitely have limits (for example, I don&#39;t buy into a lot of the &#39;alien theories&#39;). But after seeing the evidence compiled by others on here and 4chan about pizzagate, I definitely don&#39;t doubt it&#39;s plausibility. Elites in government doing these sadistic things is entirely reasonable, especially for people in positions of power for so long. Yes, I agree people being appointed by Trump who have direct ties to the Rothschild&#39;s is concerning and should be addressed, but that doesn&#39;t mean pizzagate should be thrown out or deemed absurd, just because there&#39;s a more easily recognizable issue happening in the government. Trump is doing that in the open, which is scary yes but I think that leaves vulnerability, where as pizzagate has been going on for god knows how long, and has been, for the most part, very well hidden over the past decade almost. So, no, I don&#39;t think pizzagate is a distraction nor should it be thrown out in lieu of Trumps appointees.   </p>

<p>That said, it has been long speculated and debated that the CIA used mind controlled agents like Lee Harvey Oswald, Sirhan Sirhan and James Earl Ray to assasinate JFK, RFK, and MLK.    look it up.</p>

<p>the CIA had mastered MKUltra, Artichoke, and Monarch programming by the 60s and were known to have been using it in several ways to control individuals, including sex slaves. They may have used Marilyn to smear JFK</p>

<p>Trump picking a bunch of connected insiders may disappoint some of his fans, but most of us knew he&#39;s either really one of them and just being a useful relief valve or, if he is a legitimate populist, he either has to play the game or get his pumpkin head exploded JFK-style. Again, I think few of us are really surprised, but I&#39;m glad you are reminding people. We do have to keep the heat up on the establishment.</p>

<p>Speaking of which, if we can&#39;t keep up the heat with respect to this creepy stuff, we really have no hope. It&#39;s bad enough to get numb to corruption, but accepting elite pedophile rings would be the death knell for our civilization.</p>

<p>We&#39;ve had a massive influx of new people who are beginning to look at things critically for the first time and they are having more disinfo shoved in their faces than any of us old timers ever had. I&#39;m sure people who have been here for a while remember what a trip the first year is when you start thinking with the assumption that news you hear can be false or a purposeful distraction.</p>

<p>The reddit platform is designed for distraction and disinfo though. The real conspiracy swarm is going to be on torrent/blockchain like platforms. Until the crowd moves there expect distraction and censorship to reign supreme.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Absolutely, I agree 100% that this is a possibility.</p>

<p>I&#39;ll respond with the ol&#39; Al Capone comparison that it took something as minuscule as tax evasion to finally lock up a known murderer. People weren&#39;t gonna talk or fess up, for fear of their life. It&#39;s a reach, but what if this addiction(CP) can bring the whole thing out in the open?</p>

<p>People in this Sub are much more openminded than most. If I told my neighbor there is a network of elites that use their power to manipulate a global agenda... he probably would stop watching football with me. BUT if I cautiously told him that children getting kidnapped is an epidemic and show clues that it isn&#39;t completely isolated(1 guy/random act), he would be more apt to research it independently and get redpilled.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not trying to take anything away from your presentation. I am simply clarifying(my point of view) that if someone is dead set on ruling the world, good luck... but if you start to mess with innocent children, you crossed a line, you know it, and deserved to be raked over the coals by the monsoon of people that love and preserve life over ambitions.(no I&#39;m not directing this at you, lol)</p>

<p>And Trump&#39;s picks are cabinet picks are egrigious and in your face, so these &quot;pedes&quot; just keep pushing pizzagate rather than deal with reality.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Because I&#39;ve been here since it started and back when Bush was in the White House a lot of us had very legitimate reasons back then to be wary of Prince and Blackwater and its subsequent incarnations given their role in Iraq War II and other conflicts.  They were also working for governments not so friendly to human rights and other issues.  After reading a book on Prince and the founding of Blackwater, I learned there is a lot of underlying shit (especially Crusade-type thinking) going on with him and his associates.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You don&#39;t give me very much to get upset about.</p>

<p>The question isn&#39;t whether someone worked at Goldman Sachs, but what they believe! Does he want to go back to the gold standard, audit the fed, stimulate the economy via de-regulation and tax cuts? What are his policies? The country is in bad shape, so he needs to pick people with credentials, but it really matters what these people think more than their resume.</p>

<p>BTW, I&#39;m all for dismantling public education. I&#39;d love to see a country of free private charter schools. It&#39;s stupid to let the government educate your children as it leads to indoctrination. Just because some parents can&#39;t afford school means that all teachers have to work for the government? It makes no sense.</p>

<p>As for being in a crusade, it is good to recognize that quite a few people are killing in the name of Islam. There are Madrassas spreading hate as well. I&#39;m pretty sure the people in the Trump administration are not against the religion, but the terrorism. I hope you can make a distinction between those two things because you didn&#39;t in what you wrote.</p>

<p>He associates with pedophiles and very high level politicians. He posts kids on his instagram. There are paintings on the walls of child rape.</p>

<p>Podesta hangs up child porn paintings in his house. </p>

<p>Why would they defect from Soros? It just doesn&#39;t make sense.  The far more likely explanation, based on Trumps other appointments, is that they did not defect at all and Trump has just been misrepresenting his stance on working with the establishment.</p>

<p>If there is a NWO, it&#39;s a jewish conspiracy pushing for white genocide while we pay taxes supporting their walled off genocidal ethnostate of Israel.</p>

<p>But you made this account a month ago to shill and cry about how not voting is better than voting. You drive your point home by emphasizing your favorite activity, sucking cock, and think you have made any impact on anyone else&#39;s opinion. Sorry faggot, but that&#39;s not good enough</p>
