    <div class="md"><p>You can use VPNs to browse, and use encryption to secure email. The problem here is that this gets you flagged as a person of interest. Basically the best advise is not to engage an enemy with limitless resources (governments) on a technological level. If you have personal or business information that you wish to keep private, do not connect it to the internet. Get a PC, remove the wireless card or network card, and install software using sneakernet. Never connect that PC or backups to the net. Or simply use paper.</p>

<p>If you wish to communicate securely, meet in person and go for a walk in the park.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Totally, that&#39;s why I added the &quot;vetting the die&quot; part. Obviously that&#39;s out of grasp of the majority, not just in knowledge but access too.</p>

<p>What we really need is open source processors, with some way of verifying that the chip you get is the same design. Maybe software that checks the hardware integrity. No idea how that&#39;d actually become feasible though, what with all the for-profit R&amp;D that&#39;s done now.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>After watching a few hacker conference speeches I concluded that the best defence was to just blend in with the noise. Don&#39;t go full cyberninja because that would make you stand out (significantly). Just be normal. </p>

<p>However operating on the assumption that all of our data IS collected (which it is, no need to assume), it makes sense to protect ourselves by avoiding above average usage of certains words (in email, fb chats, reddit, google searches etc). The idea is that in the future there might be some algorhytm that scans the archives of the NSA for usage of certain words with an incidence of occurence X* above the average. So if you are living in a ziofascist police-state, and you use the word holoyouknowwhat a lot of times, this algorhytm could paint a target on you. </p>

<p>The solution is to use words that an algorhytm wouldn&#39;t find, but any reader still knows what it means. Like juice. Or holocoast. Etc.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Everyone is being attacked. This is drill for US cyber security command, private sector companies etc</p>

<p>There are hundreds of billions in oil revenue, drugs, defence contracts and money, at stake. Based upon who controls the government. The pedo stuff coming out is basicly a govt coup. The other group who is in power, has reacted by mobilized DSAC and all the public/private resources they are able to.</p>

<p>Most of the assets were moved into the private sector, for intel, data mining and cyber attack/defence. So that these pedo oil drug families could control them. They also own the media and were pushing clinton. There is infighting going on within countries, between the power groups and internationally.</p>

<p>The most secure linux is Void Linux, with MUSL, on an ARM process (not AMD or Intel). So get Raspberry PI 3 and get a void linux box and run bitmessage or whatever on it.</p>

<p>They are doing all sorts of attacks. Every attack in fact. They have system they funded to identify things like decryption keys or document links or pdfs or images from internet and to censor them in real time, by intercepting internet traffic. Their program is massive in scale and has been running for years. They weaponized the whole internet. Everything.</p>

<p>The DNS system, BGP, the fiber interconnects, the ISPs, SSL/HTTPs, Facebook, Reddit, Twitter. They have weaponized everything. They have control from within twitter/reddit and also external control where they can remove content in real time over the wire.</p>

<p>Downloading bitcoin or vpn software, people on windows are reporting the SHA256 hash of the exe they receive do not match. They are live intercepting file downloads and modifying them with backdoors. Then at higher level they are able to backdoor Windows and OSX computers, using the autoupdate functionality if the target is high enough priority.</p>

<p>You have to change your HTTPS private key, every day or hour. They have a timing channel attack, to recover the private key and once they have it, can live intercept traffic. You have to use LibreSSL and host on linux distro not using OpenSSL. The certificate authorities are compromised to. If they do not have the private key, they will just use invalid cert and you will get an error and have to click through.</p>

<p>I could go on for hours about the shit they are doing. The fact that they are not spamming 200 messages a second on Bitmessage again, probably means that they have control of most of the network and message proprogration. They will run 2000 nodes on EC2, then will use their equipment to cut or degrade connections to servers they do not control.</p>

<p>If they see you running an application, they will put you on a list and your computer is automatically targeted for exploitation, to extract your private keys. So that your traffic can be retroactively decrypted. You need to rotate private key frequently (but does not matter too much right now).</p>

<p>I know through friend a computer security person in Phippines who was involved with wikileaks and did penetration testing. He was very low down on chain. He had &quot;accident&quot; then disappeared and police said he died. They may have just paid off the police and kidnapped him. They are going after everyone now, but there are too many people. They cannot van 200,000 people. They have no idea who is running the servers and a lot of it is peer-to-peer, third parties running infrastructure.</p>

<p>ALWAYS USE A VPN. Even if you are using tor, run tor inside the VPN. Paid VPN to country outside of NATO is best thing.</p>

<p>Make sure you are using linux. Linux Mint is good. Turn off Zeitgeist. Disable flash in browser.</p>

<p>Use multiple Virtual Machines. for different things. consider using </p>

<p>The PSYOPs level has been turned up to 11 also. They are spamming threads with idiots. They are designed to lower discussion level or send people down rabbit holes. To dillute information to level where the group cannot effectively function.</p>
