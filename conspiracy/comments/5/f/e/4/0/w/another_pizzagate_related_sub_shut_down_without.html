        <p><span class="badge badge-primary">294</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;2016-11-28 by <a class="author" href="../../../../../../../../user/pleasedontsuicideme.html">pleasedontsuicideme</a></p>
        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>So as some of you may know, when <a href="/r/pizzagate">/r/pizzagate</a> was banned, so were all related subs including <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/CivilianInvestigators/">https://www.reddit.com/r/CivilianInvestigators/</a> despite containing no witchhunting. I doubt the admins even saw any of the content since (if I remember right) they went down at the exact same time.</p>

<p>We admins at <a href="/r/civilianinvestigators">/r/civilianinvestigators</a> never got a response as to why our sub was banned, so we thought it <em>could</em> have been just them taking down related subs that could contain doxxing. </p>

<p>I had started up another sub to 1) test this theory and 2) if we didn&#39;t end up getting banned, to be a new sub for Pizzagate theorists to congregate.</p>

<p>Well, wouldn&#39;t you guess it...I woke up to find <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/civilianinvestigator/">https://www.reddit.com/r/civilianinvestigator/</a> had also been banned (this time, without a reason listed). Now, it was a small sub I started maybe one or two days ago, I think we only had 25 subscribers. There were very few posts, but none contained witch hunting or anything else I can find that would break the reddit rules. I suppose I didn&#39;t get a warning because it was a very small sub...But I am really thinking this just falls into censorship.</p>

<p>Can anyone else weigh in their thoughts on this? Am I just wearing too much tinfoil to think straight? </p>

<p>Edit: Also...with it being such a small sub for anyone to bother giving a warning....why did we get banned so quickly in the first place? Who found us other than searching for terms related to &#39;pizzagate&#39;?</p>

<p><strong>Edit 2: I got a response from an admin &quot;Because you, as a mod, posted PII from the already banned pizzagate subreddit in an effort to circumvent the ban placed on that subreddit.&quot;</strong> I asked them to let me know what post included personal information, because I do not recall any that was not the name or social media account of a public figure. So, if I&#39;m understanding right, I got banned for doxxing and trying to circumvent a ban.</p>

<p><strong>Edit 3: I have sent two messages to admins asking what post contained doxxing. As of now, I have not yet received a response.</strong></p>

    <div class="md"><p>Same thing happened with <a href="/r/fatpeoplehate">/r/fatpeoplehate</a>. Any remotely related subs were also given the boot. While I understand the voice, of the content, is radically different between these two subreddits, the method of deleting any remotely similar subreddits is very similar. How different is Huffman from Chairman Pao?</p>

<p>Wherever you&#39;re looking to have a forum for citizen investigators, it&#39;s not Reddit. <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> is already receiving a disinformation campaign. Stupid clickbait posts are getting voted to the top. I have no doubt that vote manipulation is going on, so any credibility of the subreddit tank&#39;s into pseudoscience, while the actual content is dust in the wind.</p>

<p>It&#39;s the mass of thousands of people converging to work on a conspiracy that is letting us move forward at this pace.
Honestly, if this subreddit remains effective, I have no doubt <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> will be removed too, have a mod overhaul, or alternative, censored form of <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> takeover. They&#39;ll rebrand it like the Patriot Act/Freedom Act. <a href="/r/trueconspiracy">/r/trueconspiracy</a> (or something like that).</p>

<p>Now&#39;s the time to find/create alternative forums to discuss, because they want the mass amount of people working on this either mislead or scattered with no hope for an alternative (before they bring it down, assuming the manipulation fails).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s jumping from lily-pad to lily-pad. Everything is compromised eventually, but it&#39;s finding the sources of stability, while they last. I&#39;m also holding out for a better alternative, but it&#39;s the best of what we have. At the moment, <a href="/u/spez">/u/spez</a> has already admitted to editing posts. It won&#39;t stop, unless you have the money to be the highest shareholder. I believe a lot of people are just holding out for a Voat mobile app. Regardless, it&#39;s the next lily, even if it&#39;s temporary.</p>

<p>There&#39;s 8chan, but there&#39;s no filtering there. A few other people are working on ideas too. There&#39;s <a href="/r/RedditAlternatives">/r/RedditAlternatives</a> for those curious. It&#39;s not like I won&#39;t stop using Reddit for the time being. There&#39;s 400k members here, whom are also posting information from 8chan, for example. Right now, it&#39;s reliability is tanking though for actual discussion on new ideas. It&#39;s just for posting, like a newspaper.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, any forum with voting is suspect to shitposting, vote brigading, and ofcourse admin/mod manipulation in the background. Flat-out taking a policy to delete posts is not the right idea. You have to take the good content with the bad. I have a few suggestions on how to filter through posts if the right developer comes along.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Fatpeoplehate really was a horrible bullying sub, and I say this as a thin person. I think most fat people know they are fat. Furthermore there is a major reason Americans are fatter and it&#39;s because of shitty processed food being everywhere. Whenever I leave NYC it is a challenge to get a good meal. </p>

<p>That being said, Reddit should not have banned it from Reddit. They should have banned it from appearing on r/all and made searches exclude it in the results. Only way to get to it should have been to be a subscriber or to type in the full address manually. </p>

<p>My 2 cents. Others will disagree I&#39;m sure. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree entirely. Hate speech will always exist. It&#39;s utopian to think it can be educated it away. Like having porn as the necessary evil, so people can tame their instincts away and ultimately deter it from churning into select occurrences for a small percentage of rape incidences.</p>

<p>It&#39;s a venue for people to cope individual hate, rage, anger, instinct away from the public.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>We had very strict rules, here is a copy if that matters:</p>

<p>Rules:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>No doxxing people or sharing profiles of non-public figures. This is part of Reddit&#39;s TOS and we will not stand for it.</p></li>
<li><p>No accusing people of being shills/CTR. Just because someone disagrees with you does not mean they are against you. Any shill accusations will be removed. If you have legitimate concerns about someone, bring it up to one of the moderators.</p></li>
<li><p>Properly flair your posts. If there isn&#39;t a flair that adaquately fits your post, PM one of the mods and they will give it a custom flair or create a new flair for everyone to use.</p></li>
<li><p>Try to avoid posting things that are common knowledge unless you have something new to add to it. Check <em>will insert sticky post here at a later date</em> for what constitutes as common knowledge.</p></li>
<li><p>Do not post any illegal content. If you do, your post will be removed, you will be banned, and you will be reported to rReddit admins, and depending on severity, the FBI. Even if you have the intention to help, it is still illegal and will compromise you, the subreddit, and anyone who clicks on it.</p></li>
<li><p>We do not tolerate harassment. No posts promoting harassment of any sort is allowed.</p></li>
<li><p>No sensationalist titles. This includes putting the title in all caps, adding &quot;smoking gun&quot; and &quot;bombshell&quot;, or asking for &quot;upvotes for visibility&quot;. If your post is a good post, people will upvote it and others will see it, we don&#39;t need clickbait or upvote requests.</p></li>
<li><p>No witch-hunts (i.e. go to this person and spam them, attack them, leave bad reviews, etc.). All this does is invalidate our investigation and make us look bad. We are not your personal army. </p></li>
<li><p>Not everything is a connection. If there is no solid reasons to believe your post contributes it may be removed (e.g. this local pizza place has a swirl in it&#39;s logo are they pedophiles?)</p></li>
<li><p>Innocence until proven guilty. Remember, being accused of pedophilia is life ruining. I recommend everyone watch the money &quot;The Hunt&quot; on Netflix starring Mads Mikkleson to get an idea of what it is like to be on the other side.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Transparency:
Any new mods added in the future will be transparent. We will make a post explaining that we added a new mod and why. We will never add a new mod secretively.</p>

<p>All mod logs will be made available to public.</p>

<p>Our mods will never PM you or otherwise bait you into joining any chat service other than <a href="https://discord.gg/DbwbjTR">https://discord.gg/DbwbjTR</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes it is censorship, but I don&#39;t think it is being done by people who want to protect pedophiles. More likely is that they just don&#39;t want to risk getting in any kind of trouble or getting otherwise blasted for hosting material involving doxxing and defamation issues, and since it&#39;s one of the most emotionally charged topics in the world, they just want to wipe it all out rather than worrying about being able to police it all in real-time 24/7. The information pooled on the sub is still all over the internet so it&#39;s not like it&#39;s just all up and gone, only the sub itself. Consider how long they let it run before shutting it down, long enough for people to create and share both written and visual summaries which could then be distributed all over the place (which is what has been happening btw). But once all the information that we were going to find had been found, the sub started to rapidly devolve into a cesspit. It served its purpose, and only then did Reddit shut it down. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Could be worth trying, but as far as I have seen, any &#39;pizzagate&#39; specific sub gets banned. It would be interesting to see their excuse for those. We would just have to be sure we didn&#39;t repost any information from the old pizzagate sub.</p>

<p>Civilian Investigators wasn&#39;t only for pizzagate, but that was our focus. We planned on branching out once pizzagate was solved. But, from the outside looking in, we were just there for Pizzagate.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not sure if you were just mistaken by my wording. They banned the sub as a whole, but did not indicate any post in particular. </p>

<p>What I&#39;m trying to figure out is what I did wrong, because from what I can tell, I posted the information from the banned sub that should have been allowed.</p>

<p>Just because certain elements of the <a href="/r/pizzagate">/r/pizzagate</a> sub were not allowed does not mean <em>everything</em> posted was not allowed. I was trying to only post what would have followed the Reddit rules, which is why I am confused.</p>

<p>I hope that made it clear.</p>

<p>If you have ever given gold (on ANY account), you have consumer rights on this website.</p>

<p>Since <a href="/u/spez">/u/spez</a> began deleting content, Reddit can no longer, legally be protected under <a href="https://www.eff.org/issues/cda230"><strong>section 230 of the Communications Decency Act.</strong></a>
<a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/5eodmq/alert_reddit_can_no_longer_legally_be_protected/">https://np.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/5eodmq/alert_reddit_can_no_longer_legally_be_protected/</a></p>

<p>After CEO, <a href="/u/Spez/">/u/Spez/</a>, changed and admitted to altering other users content, they can no longer be protected under section 230., Of which, what comes with that, is, he can now absorb, direct legal liabilities. </p>

<p>Which means, contact, and file a complaint with the ACLU.</p>

<p>File and <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/about-ftc/bureaus-offices/bureau-consumer-protection">make a complaint with the FTC</a>.</p>

<p>Lets see if this post gets deleted too. </p>
