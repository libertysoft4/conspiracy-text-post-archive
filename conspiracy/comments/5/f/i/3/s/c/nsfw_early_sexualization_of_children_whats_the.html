<p>Scroll down for NSFW images: <a href="http://www.derfreiejournalist.de/?e=144">http://www.derfreiejournalist.de/?e=144</a></p>

<p>So those are pictures from a sex ed book (Lisa &amp; Jan) in Germany and people are outraged by it&#39;s explicitly. Parents threaten to take their kids out off school if they dare to discuss this book whereas the government threatens to fine the parents if they refuse to send their kids to sex ed.</p>

<p>Now I&#39;m wondering if there is an agenda to early sexualize children and if this is somehow tied together with other stuff like PizzaG8. What&#39;s your opinion?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So why do liberals want teens to have access to birth control then? </p>

<p>Edit: are you actually saying it&#39;s ever socially acceptable for children to engage in sex, according to liberals? If so, you should be aware that liberals are just as horrified by pedophilia, sexual abuse, and children who have sex too early as you are. I think you may be confusing your worst nightmares with a bogeyman you call &quot;the liberal.&quot; Remember, the elites want you to demonize liberals because then you are easier to control ad a divided populace.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The thing is that we are divided in the way we naturally think.  there are brain chemistries associated with &quot;liberalism&quot; and &quot;conservatism&quot;- which arranged the priority of morals/ virtues. Us liberals don&#39;t much prioritize sanctity/ purity as a value, whereas his type of conservatism is driven very much by strong feelings of visceral disgust/ revulsion.</p>

<p>to them, chasteness is at the top of the ethics list.  </p>

<p>My personal opinion is that a lot of it probably comes from being raised by an anxious mother- one who may have specifically freaked out over masturbation or a sex scene in a movie when he was going through puberty.  these are the people who can&#39;t get that &quot;damn spot&quot; off their hands after they jerk off, and they tend to have a very contemptuous relationship with pornography.  it&#39;s like the right wing senators who speak about the evils of homosexuality and then seek out handjobs in rest stop bathrooms.</p>

<p>The problem i see with that conservative view of sex is that it leads to neuroticism, because it causes internal conflict.  that neruroticism is projected outward and sex becomes more of a vice/ addiction and control mechanism.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Yes.</p>

<p>Anyway, there are lots of reasons to push birth control. The answers are never simple and are usually &quot;many small rivers&quot; agendas. Birth control is an industry just like any other, and unless we are just talking condoms they are also hormonal treatments, which inevitably ever so slightly alters your personality. Considering that we are in <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> you can also go into theories such as estrogen polluting the water supply through birth control pills to create less &quot;manly men&quot; or more commonly known as beta cucks, but this is not something I&#39;ve really paid much thought to.</p>

<p>If you think I&#39;m &quot;demonizing&quot; the &quot;liberal&quot; for any other reason than their own fucking behavior then you&#39;re wrong. It&#39;s also a really good way to flush out the exact same people I&#39;m talking about because they never fail to take the bait.</p>

<p>Also whenever someone says that X group is Y way they never EVER FUCKING EVER mean literally all of them. Liberals are really good at not grasping this.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The goal is to eventually give children a codified set of &quot;sexual rights&quot; that the parents cannot interfere with or prevent...which once in place will eventually lead to a child wanting the right to have sex with an &quot;adult&quot; and by adult I mean someone who just turned legal age. This will start with a 14-15 year old (underage) wanting to have sex with a 16-18 year old (adult) which although still a crime is not really that big of an age difference, and then it will be legislated that the underage child has a choice and a right to &quot;healthily&quot; sexually express themselves in the manner they choose...the resulting legislation will basically legalize pedophilia and destroy parental rights over their chidren. This will take some time but I think it is happening now...California just relaxed the punishment to minors for nudity and online sexual activity (their reason was that the minors were being unfairly punished as the victims) but in doing so may have created a loophole for underage children to have the freedom to have their own webcam and not be punished for distributing illegal images.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Repressed sexuality and excessive sexuality are equally disastrous for a person&#39;s life. Both the far right and the far left have the same goal: rob general society of intellectual and spiritual power by controlling our sexuality. One pushes extreme abstinence, one pushes extreme promiscuity and exposes children to sexuality before they&#39;re emotionally prepared for it. Do not be a victim of either of these teachings.</p>

<p>As for the &quot;homosexual agenda&quot;, I&#39;m not sure what the fuck is up with that, but humans are a naturally bisexual species. Pushing heterosexuality as the norm is a form of brainwashing and control from the religious elite. It prevents people of the same sex from forming deep emotional bonds with one another, which lowers the combined power of the masses; and it causes a lot of unwanted and unplanned children to be born, which slowly lowers the individual power of the masses and creates a large pseudo-slave population to work with. Don&#39;t fall prey to this either.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ask yourself this: why are mainstream religions <em>so sure</em> that sexual orientation is a choice? What gives them such extreme confidence in the matter? The average religious person ultimately can&#39;t tell you why beyond &quot;just because&quot;, and edge masters would have you believe it&#39;s because religious people are all retarded sheeple, but that&#39;s not it.</p>

<p>It&#39;s because the religious elite know that for the majority of people, it <em>is</em> a choice. The majority of humans are inherently bisexual and are brainwashed into suppressing their bisexuality in favor of monosexuality. Most go the hetero way, a small handful go the homo way, but if you release them from the brainwashing most come to realize that they are in fact bisexual. True monosexuality just isn&#39;t very common.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not sure what&#39;s motivating the recent push to get people to choose the homo way instead of the hetero way, but I can only imagine it&#39;s some kind of power play, just like any other elite agenda. It&#39;s very telling that despite increased acceptance of homosexuality, bisexuality is still very heavily looked down upon and dismissed. That isn&#39;t an accident. Sexual self-determination is power, and nobody at the top wants us at the bottom to have that.</p>

<p>also sex between two guys involves ur dick going into a person&#39;s ass where his feces and other things the body it&#39;s trying to get rid of goes. i dont think ur asshole was meant to take a dick. bottom line.</p>

<p>sure its okay to have love for another man, but not stick ur dick in his asshole... i may be wrong tho.

    <div class="md"><p>The primary role of sex is to reproduce, but it also has other important functions like stress reduction and social bonding. This is observed in many sexual species, so humans aren&#39;t really unique in that regard.</p>

<p>I actually agree about anal sex. To each their own, but the back door really is meant to be a one way lane, and it doesn&#39;t seem very intuitive to drive up it the wrong way, especially when you consider that the prostate (the &quot;diamond in the rough&quot; of anal sex) can be stimulated externally. You may be surprised to know that most male-male sex historically and around the world doesn&#39;t actually involve anal penetration though. A mere century ago the prevalence of anal sex in the west was under 10% in men who prefered the company of men, and now it&#39;s as high as 75% in some areas. This is <em>entirely</em> due to social conditioning (brainwashing). The power of suggestion really is insane.</p>

<p>What&#39;s kinda funny is recently male-male couples are starting to reject anal sex again, while male-female couples are starting to adopt it. And women don&#39;t even have prostates. What a ridiculous world it is sometimes.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My first masturbation wasn&#39;t until I was in middle school. If I was sex educated by that book, I would have lost my virgin in elementary school. </p>

<p>This seems like a Satanic agenda, making sex prevalent and devaluing the marriage. Marriage is heavily associated with family value. Lack of family value will then lead to a loss of respect for elders and or for women. In Christianity, God represents Father, Husband (to Israel), Brother (Jesus to disciples), and Son (Jesus).  </p>

<p>I think government will have easier time to make single minded hive if there is no family value. God would have no power when there is no love. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>When I was very young, (4 or 5 probably, late 80&#39;s) I had a lot of questions about anatomy and where babies come from. My parents had a couple of books geared toward teaching young children that included black and white photographs of children playing in water. They were not wearing clothes but there was nothing sexual about it. It was literally &quot;boys have these parts, girls have these parts.&quot;  There was no discussion of anything sexual beyond the standard &quot;tell an adult if someone touches you here.&quot;  I also remember watching a cartoon in college sociology that is shown in sex ed somewhere other than the US (Sweden, maybe?) that was quite thorough. How to hide an erection. The importance of making sure both partners receive attention. Again, VERY thorough. But aimed at teenagers. There&#39;s a pretty damn big difference between teaching young children about their bodies and what this book is showing. I&#39;m all for being open and honest with kids, but there is such a thing as being age appropriate. I can see why parents are upset. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Increase birth rates for the war machine / boost their corporate earnings through exploitation of labor and wages. Dismantle the nuclear family or any real family at all. Creating uneducated ghettos with no ties to family history or wealth passed down. Perpetuating slave labor or a life of crime that feeds the welfare and prison complexes. If this doesn&#39;t work, they will supplement our numbers via expanded immigration, with classes for uneducated immigrants on how to approach women and diagrams on how to mate (see Germany). The only ones being enriched are the ones who created the cabal we are being told to normalize.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The problem seems to be the people who think sexuality is evil. While my German is very limited, these images don&#39;t seem pornographic, they seem to depict children exploring themselves. Didn&#39;t we all do that as kids? I was raised Catholic, and taught that I was a bad kid for touching myself or other children&#39;s &quot;privates&quot;. That messed with my head as a kid. I didn&#39;t understand why it was so wrong to kiss a girl and touch her body. I felt shame throughout my childhood for being a normal curious child. </p>

<p>Pedophilia is not on the rise. Hypersensitivity seems to be on the rise. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Dude, why the fuck are you linking to something like this? </p>

<p>As to your question, sex ed doesn&#39;t need to be something to panic about. How do you know it&#39;s sexualizing? If it&#39;s government approved shouldn&#39;t it be like an anatomy picture? Unless I&#39;m off base here? Just because you teach children what their body is called or can one day do doesn&#39;t mean they&#39;re being sexed up. I doubt any of those kids get excited by the images or run out and try to have sex. </p>

<p>I can see people not wanting those kinda of nsfw images to be shown though. Why don&#39;t they use drawings of cartoon characters or gingerbread people or something benign?</p>
