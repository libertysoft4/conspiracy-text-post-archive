        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>We are getting censored here - 4chan/8chan is most likely infiltrated and strange things are also happening on voat. The power structure is doing everything to distort, discredit or ban any serious news that comes to light and I&#39;m certain they will completely ban such fake news all together if we get any closer to the truth.</p>

<p>There are already some approaches regarding blockchain social network such as Synereo or Akasha (Based on Ethereum). But somehow it seems as if development isn&#39;t going forwards efficiently and also I&#39;m not sure if the development will go in the direction that is necessary.</p>

<p>We need some kind of way to separate CIA, FBI shills from legitimate people. Here is the idea I have:
- ethereum based forum (localhost forum connected to ETH)
- other people can join by invite only
- invite link works for only 1 person at a time (new key must be generated for each new person)
- in the blockchain it is accessible to see who invited who (invitation tree)</p>

<p>Posting system:
- user can create post similar to other forums
- structure of subgroups
- similar voting system to here</p>

<p>How to block shills and spammers:
- every user can locally ban shillers or other suspected agents locally (meaning their up/downvotes aren&#39;t shown + the content that they post)
- every user has the possibility to find the last common &quot;node&quot; (user) that invited these shills and completely block a subtree of the sent invitations </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Because steemit.com sucks. </p>

<p>The idea is great, and the devs seem to have their hearts in the right place (despite complaints about pre-mining, obscure code, ununderstood math, wealth distribution etc), and have created a proof-of-concept blockchain that seems to be working, for the most part. </p>

<p>But the interface plain sucks, is terrible to browse and navigate, and lacks all that makes Facebook, MySpace and Reddit good ideas. </p>

<p>And they advertise as &quot;blog, curate and make $$$&quot; instead of &quot;here is a decentralised, censorship-proof social media&quot;. </p>

Bad evile shit like CP will be posted.<br/>
Witch then make,s the whole blockchain illigal.<br/>
And u can get jailed for just running it.<br/>
.<br/>
Now if u add the ability to remove and adjust shit.<br/>
Then the whole reason u made that program is useless sins it can and will be controlled to suite some one,s mind </p>

Even within a decentralised service where no single individual can be made responsable, the service could be flooded with CP scaring off the majority of the traffic with threats of police prosecution.

<p>It may be workable to a smaller scale though, given the context of vetting. But then the community becomes more insular, more akin to the regulars at some small IRC channel than the broad scope of a large forum community like reddit.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s complicated and requires many hours of programming and committed developers who might or might not be compensated/alienated for their work. And good talent tends to migrate where the money is -- big corps. Currently, Reddit is very popular, and any new platform will struggle for mind share. Decentralisation may prevent censorship and banning but won&#39;t thwart intelligent shills from joining and brigading. I just don&#39;t see how you can realistically separate legitimate users from shills without draconian censorship. </p>

<p>Why not just set up a private, encrypted chatroom/forum?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I love this idea.  I think there are a few things that would be useful in a system like this.  </p>

<ul>
<li><p>A user should state a supposition supported by evidence.  The network then can either come to consensus to verify or refute a claim.  </p></li>
<li><p>Once the network has verified a block, it can be used as a static point of reference to have other suppositions jump-off from.</p></li>
<li><p>Force users to state whether they are for, against or neutral each supposition when they post.  The community should be able to identify shills with this extra info.</p></li>
<li><p>User should be valued in the system by how quickly their feedback matches with their claim in its aid of either helping the community agree to verify or disprove a block.</p></li>

<p>If its founder can release the BETA version (be ok with it nOT being perfect), it will change the world. If I remember right, Maid stands for Multi-Array of Individual Discs, because it&#39;s a distributed platform that taps into each client&#39;s local disc (hard drive) - assigned/alotted by local owner. Whatever you upload, it will be split into four redundant chunks, and connected via multiple layers of encryption, and brought back together only for the client with the correct PIN, passphrase and username.</p>

<p>It may very well be the longest running startup ever (going on about 12 years now), they only JUST released their <strong><a href="https://maidsafe.net/alpha.html">ALPHA</a></strong> about 8 months ago, so go set it up and play around. Granted, they&#39;re developing ground breaking algorithms and TCP based protocols, but still taking a long time to go live.</p>
