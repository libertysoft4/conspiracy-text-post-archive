The pictures of piles of emaciated bodies that you see in old videos were from the end of the war when the germans had trouble feeding their own troops. There were also bad apples in the military who may have sadistically killed jews because they were sick bastards. But evidence of an intentional policy to eliminate jews in this way is scant</p>

    <div class="md"><p>it&#39;s very difficult to find info on the holocaust that turns into solid facts, one way or another, whether confirming or criticizing. Something that makes fact finding exponentially more difficult is that jews have been a partially-integrated ethnic group that have a history of changing their last name/religious practices in areas of extreme anti-semetism. Hitler didn&#39;t just go off some population census and look for jews, in the way that people who don&#39;t believe the holocaust happened seem to think. He utilized &quot;judenraten&quot;, a jewish individual he bought off to act as a spy to list all of the jewish people in an area so he could get an accurate count on the number.</p>

<p>Regardless of what happened, all the people that died were tragic and hitler did very bad things.</p>

<p>There is no possible way to pay back the federal reserve; all dollars printed come with interest. Where does the money to pay back the interest come from? More dollars! It requires perpetual economic growth to sustain itself, but it still is on the precipice of failure due to the amount of foreign debt. </p>

<p>A country could just print money as needed. Congress wants to spend X this year? OK. Congress prints X this year. The system isn&#39;t perfect, but it is damn sure better than what we have. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>QE is literally printing money. So you just don&#39;t want the Fed in charge and instead the US govt? That just means it&#39;s a matter of time until the powers that be gain control over than also. And I&#39;m curious by what you mean by Congress performing functionally. If you mean they should stop interfering with businesses by enacting regulations that benefit only a select few then I agree. It&#39;s time we go back to a free market. Without a foolproof plan to guarantee transparency I don&#39;t think there&#39;s any hope for us to try any form of government that involves heavy govt involvement with the economy. Although I do like the idea of socialism more than other forms of government I realize it&#39;s not realistic at the current time. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The Fed is a private group with virtually no transparency, so if money is to be printed, I&#39;d rather it come straight from elected officials and without interest attached. We may disagree on the role of Congress in terms of how active they should be, but functional would mean not obstructing the budget for political leverage, causing the nation be on the brink of default. A lot of it comes from the two party system and obligation to vote with the party.</p>

<p>I think socialism is viable, but there still seems to be a Red Scare mentality among the boomers. Perhaps as the millennials become a greater share of the voting block, things will change.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No modern society can function without currency…period. Currency belongs to the people not private bankers. So the question is who provides it? A private, for-profit enterprise who loans it into existence at interest…or a gov of the people who spends it into existence for the benefit of the people.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s a big 10-4 good buddy</p>

<p>As a Canadian I look at your healthcare system thusly…</p>

<p>You have a Dr and a patient and a health insurer. The Dr provides service…the patient requires/purchases it and the insurer sits in the middle and exchanges the cash…taking a huge chunk off the top. The insurer does nothing. They don&#39;t heal…they don&#39;t create new life saving procedures or equipment. They are completely superfluous to the transaction.</p>

<p>And…so is the Federal Reserve. Currency creation could be achieved through the US Treasury spending new currency into existence through infrastructure spending, for ex…exactly the same way Canada did it until 1974.</p>

<p>There is no need for the gov to borrow money from the Fed, at interest, when it could easily spend it into existence interest free. It is the fn height of insanity and has created generations of debt slaves.</p>

<p>The only reason there is a Federal Income Tax is due to the debt based nature of currency creation.</p>

<p>As Henry Ford once said…paraphrasing…if the average citizen was aware of how currency is created there would be a revolution by tomorrow morning. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>QE is literally printing money. So you just don&#39;t want the Fed in charge and instead the US govt? That just means it&#39;s a matter of time until the powers that be gain control over than also. And I&#39;m curious by what you mean by Congress performing functionally. If you mean they should stop interfering with businesses by enacting regulations that benefit only a select few then I agree. It&#39;s time we go back to a free market. Without a foolproof plan to guarantee transparency I don&#39;t think there&#39;s any hope for us to try any form of government that involves heavy govt involvement with the economy. Although I do like the idea of socialism more than other forms of government I realize it&#39;s not realistic at the current time. </p>
