<p>Good did not win here people. Stop playing these stupid games. It was another election where people had to vote for the lesser of two evils.</p>

<p>Both had deep rooted conflicts of interest.</p>

<p>Both have enough money that makes them out of touch with middle class America.</p>

<p>Both have questionable relationships with horrible people.</p>

<p>Both are professional liars.</p>

<p>There will be a lot of cognitive dissonance going forward. </p>

<p>Right now, the Trump-bots are all talking about how horrible Mitt Romney is because he dared insult the God Emperor. </p>

<p>But if Trump includes Romney in his cabinet, watch how the Trump-bots will rationalize it and start saying how Romney isn&#39;t such a bad guy after all. It&#39;s either this or &quot;the god emperor is playing 5D chess; he&#39;s keeping his enemies close, he&#39;s draining the swamp by putting the swamp monsters in his cabinet&quot;. </p>

<p>We&#39;ve seen this already with several of Trump&#39;s awful cabinet picks. </p>

<p>The same amount of cognitive dissonance it takes to keep &quot;murdering, money laundering, primary cheating, has a husband who is a rapist&quot; Hillary Clinton out of prison.</p>

<p>Does that help?</p>

<p>It takes cognitive dissonance to keep that woman out of prison. She is a criminal, focus on putting her in jail.</p>

<p>Don&#39;t worry about what Trump did, he&#39;s yet to steal money from Haiti or murder anyone and his wife isn&#39;t a rapist.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve never said I intend to put her in jail. It&#39;s beyond me. Trump said he&#39;d do it though, but then -- &quot;surprise, surprise&quot; -- he changed his mind. Not surprising, really, since he&#39;s a close friend of the Clintons and since he&#39;s donated huge sums to TCF and to Hillary&#39;s campaigns. The zionist billionaire is not gonna lock up a good friend; he&#39;s too busy appointing neocons, zionists, warmongers and Goldman Sachs executives to his &quot;anti establishment&quot; cabinet. It&#39;s called &quot;draining the swamp&quot;, supposedly. It&#39;s what he does when he&#39;s not at AIPAC, promising to give Israel more money and start a war against Iran. </p>

<p>English is my second language, so sometimes I am indeed having trouble comprehending what I&#39;m reading. </p>

<p>Except the users attacking Bernie for buying a 600k house and saying he was out of touch with the middle class. Compare this to the person  who is going to be president and you see how it actually makes sense. </p>

True. I understand that point.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know how true this is, but there are many articles out there saying he didn&#39;t have a regular job until he was 40. </p>

<p>Apparently his net worth is around 500k-1M? <a href="http://moneynation.com/bernie-sanders-net-worth/">http://moneynation.com/bernie-sanders-net-worth/</a></p>

<p>There are just a lot of signs that state that he would not be able to comfortably afford three homes (one that cost 600k) because after taxes that 200k isn&#39;t all that much. Especially when you take into account living costs and the extra costs when financing a home.</p>

<p>He was a...</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Senator from January 3, 2007 - Present. 
House Member January 3, 1991 – January 3, 2007</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So not that much time to make that kind of money. Even then he recently bought that 600k home. Either it was a consolation prize or he used campaign funds to buy the home. I don&#39;t know which it is, but its suspicious timing.</p>

But honestly compared to the average middle class citizen, would a house that was bought for 650k be realistically affordable? And really it doesnt matter.</p>

<p>Also, Im not comparing their wealth. Im saying Bernie has enough money and assets to be considered upper class. As does Trump. But both he and Trump resonate and connect with the less fortunate.

<p>Trump has some really good policies, as most of them tend to lean towards a free market solution. Hes a bit hawkish when it comes to security, but its all in good faith. As long as he stays within the parameters of the constitution i cant argue.</p>

<p>Also it seems as if you have a serious problem with people whom are religious or believe in any god.

    <div class="md"><p>I have a problem with religious people who use it as an excuse to oppress others. Why won&#39;t you answer to his creationist and anti gay appointees? I can only assume it&#39;s because you agree with them. I don&#39;t buy into any MSM, I buy into human rights and not turning back social progress back to the 50s because this is about all us middle class people get from our corporate government. </p>

<p>I am all for free market and trade reform but this is about as far as I agree with any of his &quot;policies&quot;. I could give two shits about immigration reform, it&#39;s very small potatoes. You&#39;re the one that has bought into his hate and fear tactics. If you are following along with the vein of this subreddit (just to remind you, this is <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>.) 9/11 was an inside job as well as any other massively publicized terror attack brought on to the western world and any terror attack or organization poking their boogie man heads up in the middle east was invented by the same ilk that did 9/11 to further their agenda of control. 9/11 being an inside job negates any argument for a wall or bolstering our already massive military industrial machine. Trump is a insecure feeble little man who at one point <em>may</em> have thought he stood a chance to make things right but the only way to make this country right is to hang the 1% and guillotine all in washington who vote against the interest of the many for the greed of the few. Trump is a greedy fucking twerp and will merely use this opportunity for his gain. </p>

<p>If you can&#39;t be critical of the man which I have not seen you do once in any of our crossed paths then you have bought into the alt-right&#39;s talking points. I don&#39;t put my head in an echosphere for information, I am objective, I am pointing out that policies like forcing creationism into public schools and abstinence only are disasters and far from progress. I am upset that Trump appoints people that contribute to anti gay groups is wrong. If you are for these things I can and will not see eye to eye with you.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ok. Who is anti gay or creationist out of his 3 appointees so far? Not to mention that you fail to realize Trumps position on gay marriage and other social issues are more in common with progressivee than old guard republicans. And once again, your claims about education are completely backwards like i tried to explain to you the last time we debated about this.</p>

<p>Also, i know full well 9/11 was an inside job. To what extent? No one really knows. You dont know, i dont know. We just smell something fishy. But guess what, so does Trump.</p>

<p>And just because many major events like this couldve been false flags or hoaxes, does not mean immigration isnt an important issue or that there arent any extremists whatsoever in the world. </p>

<p>The problem is illegal immigration. Not only does a pourous border leave members of ISIS or other extremists in, but also other regular common folk, that lowers wages here all the while sending remittance back home. Immigration is more important policy than most people think.</p>

<p>But i just want to say lastly, i can be very critical of Trump. I dont like that hes playing with Romney or Patreus as SoS. Although its probably just another strategy point. I dont like his hawkish security positions, thats where is authoritarianism can come in. Thankfully im sure he will stay within his constitutionality for decisions he makes. </p>

<p>But honestly alot of you guys on here are taking the criticism a little too far.
By all means critique and debate, but the man hasmt done anything yet, hasnt even been inaugurated yet and you guys act as if he just opened up concentration camps all the time.</p>

<p>Than many of you, not you specifically, sit there and act like a guy who basically robbed millions of good honest people of their money, while acting like hes the next revolutionary, completely gave up on his own message. This subs gibes me alot of mixed emotions and it doesnt make sense half the time.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well Trump is giving his life up to serve the American people, as far as i can see, for our best interest. He could just ride out the rest of his years in style, but decised to run for president. But as far as his education policy goes to his tax reforms to immigration reform, many of his policies are both constitutional and for the good of the people.</p>

<p>A huge problem with people thinking Trump is extremely divisive and racist and xenophobic and every other ist that people called him and his supporters, is the media. Which we know Clinton had in the bag.</p>

<p>Trump is what we call a pied piper candidate, this was in the DNC hacks. The media propped up Cruz Carson and Trump to let them become front runners, than when the nominee started to be chosen from that group, they start the media witch hunt. Almost nothing about Trumps policies are racist or xenophobic or anything like that.</p>

He,s not been linked to murders yet ( like hills body bag list )<br/>
There is some info about him and the pedo express but that is still kinda cloudy.<br/>
The thing is the media and loads of other players where against him.<br/>
And all the stuff they attacked him on was kinda low compared to Hillary,s shit list.<br/>
I do agree trump needs to be toughly scanned.<br/>
But anything that has to do whit corporate scams and tax evasion is a mute point sins well every one that can would do those things ( and law allowed it so mhe ) </p>

<p>We have to stop him! (Why because he goes against your personal ideology?)</p>

<p>The democracy has spoken, but typically like most Americans, they need to be fully involved in the process so they can feel some form of personal control, the same phenomena leaders experience when they go into countries all over the world and try to keep their hands directly on the power structure of various nations.</p>

<p>The election is over. Trump is going to be president, the more you undermine him the worse of a job he will do, that doesn&#39;t mean people can say I told you so if he fails.</p>

<p>Bill Clinton is a rapist, he&#39;s not going back to the white house. The Clinton Foundation is a money laundering scheme, it&#39;s being investigated, the Clinton family may be associated with murder, it is being investigated.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You seem to be among those that missed the whole point of why CTR was such a big deal on here. Both sides have armies of shills pushing their narratives with equal vigour and anyone who thinks otherwise is dangerously naive. By concentrating on the Clinton campaign&#39;s outed shills, Trump&#39;s shills managed to deflect attention away from themselves. Now that the election is over, CTR&#39;s job is largely done but Trump&#39;s shrill orange spinsters are just getting started for an eight-year run. Politics <em>is</em> conspiracy.</p>

<p>Since you&#39;re obviously quite invested in slobbering his knob, can you tell me why YOU believe his cabinet picks show he&#39;s not corrupted to the hilt?

    <div class="md"><p>Ignoring the obvious Jeffrey Epstein for now,  lets focus first on Rudy Giuliani,  longtime Trump Friend and who is currently being considered for Secretary of State, Rudy headed the &quot;investigation&quot; into the pedophile operations at West Point in the 1980&#39;s. Despite overwhelming evidence, Giuliani did not secure a single indictment and in fact facilitated the protection of the ring:</p>

<pre><code>The West Point case, among others, was alleged to be linked to the Presidio case. As The Times Herald Record reported in June 1991, the &quot;incidents [at the West Point Child Development Center] unfolded against a backdrop of satanic acts, animal sacrifices and cult-like behavior among the abusers, whose activities extended beyond the U.S. Military Academy borders to Orange County and a military base in San Francisco, parents charged.&quot; The case first broke in July 1984, when a three-year-old girl found herself in the emergency room of the West Point Hospital with a lacerated vagina. She told the examining physician that a teacher at the daycare center had hurt her. The next month, the parents of another child leveled accusations of abuse at the center. As the Mercury News reported, &quot;by the end of the year, 50 children had been interviewed by investigators. Children at West Point told stories that would become horrifyingly familiar. They said they had been ritually abused. They said they had had excrement smeared on their bodies and been forced to eat feces and drink urine. They said they were taken away from the day care center and photographed.&quot;

Despite abundant medical and psychological evidence and literally dozens of child witnesses, and despite &quot;950 interviews by 60 FBI agents assigned to the investigation,&quot; the investigation, &quot;led by former U.S. Attorney [and future mayor] Rudolph Giuliani&quot; produced &quot;no federal grand jury indictments,&quot; according to the Herald Record. &quot;In 1987, Giuliani said his detailed investigation showed only one or two children were abused.&quot; Giuliani&#39;s contention was directly contradicted by an independent investigation, as the Herald report divulged: &quot;a still-secret, independent report - produced by one of the nation&#39;s top experts on child sexual abuse - confirms the children&#39;s accusations of abuse.&quot;

www.real-debt-elimination.com/child_protection/child_sexual_abuse_at_the_Presidio_and_Westpoint.htm
</code></pre>

<p>It would later emerge that one of Giuliani&#39;s &quot;oldest friends&quot; is Fr. Alan Placa, a Catholic priest implicated in pedophile operations:</p>

<pre><code>Rudy Giuliani&#39;s consulting firm, Giuliani Partners, has for years employed a Catholic priest who was accused by a grand jury of orchestrating the over-up of nearly 60 separate molestations allegation -- a priest who allegedly partook of the activities himself. The priest, Alan Placa, is one of Giuliani&#39;s oldest friends; in turn, Giuliani has become Placa&#39;s highest-profile defender.

<p>The worst thing we could see is the same: he is playing by his own rule. We dont know how shits will look like and prepare for it. This makes him a bad president in terms of policies. Who the hell knows what he is up to, and why? And this uncertainty is pretty scary.</p>

<p>Overall, this makes the hopes high and expectations low tho.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You need to give it time. Whats the point of arguing so much about this when the man hasnt got into office yet. The sitting POTUS is still allowing children to be bombed, protesters to be beaten, treating whistleblowers like shit, etc. Pizzagate evidence is being vaporized!!! (a little /s)</p>

<p>Also, how come people who can realize that most of what these politicians push through as law, ie war on drugs, ends up being a ploy to divert funds from the majority to a tiny minority, yet when it comes to &quot;climate change&quot; suddenly every piece of shit politician is working for the common good? The cognitive dissonance is astonishing. Think about the term, its completely inocuous and neutral, yet evokes religious levels of apolyptic fervor, to the point where people give up their sovereignty. Global climate agreements arent ratified for a reason.</p>

<p>Pollution, deforestation, animal poaching... all horrible. But I&#39;m not sure what to think about the changes in weather. Weather is not climate, by the way. </p>

<p>When I hear the words &quot;99% of experts agree...&quot; attatched to any claim, my bullshit meter goes up. Maybe yours should, too. </p>

Looking at reddit, nobody focus on his meeting with Gary Cohn and everyone just focus on him commenting about the flag burning.

<p>Trump has some really good policies, as most of them tend to lean towards a free market solution. Hes a bit hawkish when it comes to security, but its all in good faith. As long as he stays within the parameters of the constitution i cant argue.</p>

<p>Also it seems as if you have a serious problem with people whom are religious or believe in any god.
