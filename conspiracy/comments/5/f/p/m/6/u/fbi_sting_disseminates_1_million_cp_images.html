<pre><code>Your Honor, starting with Michaud, and what we know now
is there was no discussion of trying to limit the distribution.
There were no protocols for these agents for handling or 
limiting the distribution of child pornography. And the scale 
of the distribution now went out to at least 120 countries, 
at least 1 million images. And it is absolutely mind boggling, 
we have not seen something like this.

And for all the area covered by the investigation -- the number 
of computers scattered all over the world the FBI sent its NIT to --
there, so far, seems to be very little to show for the agency&#39;s 
efforts. Defense lawyer Colin Fieman:

We have never, in our nation&#39;s history as far as I can tell,
seen a warrant so utterly sweeping. 100,000 potential targets. 
Something like 8700 IP addresses captured. At least 1152 open
investigations. And now oddly enough only, about 214 arrests.

Those were pictures of real kids who&#39;s images the FBI used to supposedly entrap pedophiles, so they knowingly pimp the images of some abused children out for the viewing pleasure of thousands of pedophiles. What the hell. What did they do to save the kids in those pictures? Nothin i&#39;m guessing. They&#39;re just adding one more violation of their lives to the list of sins committed against them.</p>

<p>Of course there will always be pedophiles, but the idea is to kill the demand for it by making every pedophile paranoid as fuck about getting vanned every time they wanna be a disgusting fuck. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think the stakes are a little different than the war on drugs personally. Drug users are usually only inflicting harm on themselves or what could be argued to be self-harming (I totally disagree with the war on drugs so I&#39;m with you on that.)</p>

<p>I fully believe that the demand drives a market and not the market creating demand so people who purposefully participate in dissemination and viewing of child pornography are as legally reprehensible as those who produce it and traffic children. I think even if there is 100 million pictures or videos out there the harm to children has already been done, at least they can try and prevent it in the future. </p>

<p>Also the suppliers and traffickers aren&#39;t untouched. The FBI owned them and siezed the server or infiltrated their group. They&#39;re just as fucked and even more fucked than just the people looking at it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Playpen darkweb CP site made faster by FBI</p>

<p>Newly filed court exhibits now suggest that the site 
performed substantially better while under the FBI&#39;s 
control, with users commenting on the improvements. 
The defense for the man accused of being the original 
administrator of Playpen claims that these improvements 
led to the site becoming even more popular.</p>

<pre><code>“The FBI distributed child pornography to viewers and 
downloaders worldwide for nearly two weeks, until at least 
March 4, 2015, even working to improve the performance 
of the website beyond its original capability,” Peter Adolf,
an assistant federal defender in the Western District of 
North Carolina, writes in a motion to have his client’s
indictment thrown out.

</blockquote>

<p>Out of those 100,000 potential targets, the vast majority of them were probably someone who took a look but didn&#39;t actually download anything. </p>

<p>It&#39;s pretty hard to lay charges, or even open up an investigation on someone if there&#39;s no record of any data transfer. The suspect wouldn&#39;t have any images on their computer and could always say they clicked on the wrong site by accident.</p>

<p>The 8700 IP addresses captured might have been &quot;browsers&quot; like this. The 1152 open investigations are likely the ones that downloaded and uploaded stuff back.</p>

<p>The cops probably want to spend a bit more time networking with them in order to get them and the other people they might be networking with.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;By now, many journalists and activists concerned with how the police deal with the CP laws are aware that the American police and some related agencies are the main, and likely the sole, dealers in and publishers of images of CP, using them for entrapment purposes.&quot;.(Brian Rothery: &quot;Every image of a child being abused&quot;). A government that lies to the people ceases to be the lawful government of this land; lies used to initiate search warrants for CP in search of pedophiles are the worst possible lies a government can commit against its own people.In fact child sexual abuse has fallen more than 60% from 1992 to present, according to David Finkelhor director of the crimes against children research center in New Hampshire along with Lisa Jones another leading expert on child sexual abuse who have tracked the trend; contrary to what the child abuse industry (the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children) states.</p>

<p>&quot;Child Pornography&quot; (CP) has no agreed definition. Legally, it can refer to various kinds of media featuring minors in situations depicting nudity or sexual conduct. &quot;Evidence for a causal relationship between exposure to pornography and sexual aggression is slim at best and has been exaggerated by politicians, pressure groups and many social scientists who write research papers for hundreds of thousands of dollars that quote each other and disseminate old research. Some of the debate has focused on violent pornography, but evidence of any negative effects is inconsistent, and violent pornography is comparatively rare in the real world. Victimization rates for rape in the United States demonstrate an inverse relationship between pornography consumption and rape rates.&quot;  (Ferguson, J. and Hartley, R. (2009). &quot;The pleasure is momentary…the expense damnable?)
