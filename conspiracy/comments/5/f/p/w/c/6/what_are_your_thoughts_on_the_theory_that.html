<p>I was contemplating on this last night after digging my way out of some flat earth stuff. Assuming the earth is a globe and other worlds and dimensions exists then the possibility of ET theory is valid. After reading I started to think about how everything we see ties into one another (especially in the worlds current state of affairs) and as for as a conspiracy goes it doesn&#39;t get much better. One example that immediately came to mind was the election and the possibility that the Dragconians/Reptilians and Anunnaki are fighting for power positions. It&#39;s &quot;theorized&quot; that the Dragconians are the main controlling power and the Reptilians are what they use onsite to control the world. If you go off the the idea that TPTB are Reptilians i.e. The Clintons and many of the prior presidents. Now look at the Anunnaki who are also referred to as Aryans. Blue eyed blonde hair... remind you of someone?  I did look at the pictures of Trump and although his bio list him as having brown eyes a lot of pictures show differently just search Donald Trumps eye color and see for yourself. </p>

<p>We could have very been apart of and Anunnaki Dragconian power struggle disguised as a presidential election. </p>

<p>If someone has any other thoughts or possible connections with this theory I would love to hear them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re the one that brought up the alien/Reptilians and I gave you a theory as it may pertain to my nations government. But let&#39;s just say TPTB are Reptilians or at least under control from the Greys. If my government is under that control so is yours and everyone else&#39;s. Doesn&#39;t matter is debates are over the whole system would be a facade. </p>

<p>I was adding to the current controversies and added a potential power struggle between two of the theorized alien overlords. This is r/conspiracy not r/I&#39;llpostatopicanddismiseverycomment. Not trying to be a dick at all but at least try to entertain or discuss the comment. </p>

<p>I also added if you recall that it would be nice to hear someone else&#39;s theories that may tie into the idea. 
I&#39;ll add another just so it doesn&#39;t look like I&#39;m stuck on the POTUS crap. Pizzagate has come to light with  child trafficking and pedophiles and how the elite are behind the whole program. If the elite are aliens, either greys or Reptilians, then maybe the purpose for the trafficking is not necessarily for trafficking kids for sex but for either A. Food , B. Medical studies, C. Some kind of host/slave take over or D. Combination of all the above. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Peter Khoury&#39;s story is one of the stories that really made me think about this kind of stuff.. Has an encounter with two really tall female aliens and found strands of hair after, had them analyzed and they were very strange, indicating The sample came from two very rare and diverse lineages of humanity, one Gaelic, one Mongol/Chinese. Although I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s true, (kinda hoping someone here can help with that) it&#39;s still quite interesting.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I used to commute to Hollywood, California for school. On the way, I was listening to a lot of lectures by Jordan Maxwell, David Icke, Arizona Wilder etc.</p>

<p>Once I got to my destination, I parked my car and started walking to my class. As I was walking, I was thinking about what I had been listening to for the last hour and a half in the car.</p>

<p>When I reached the corner of the street, I saw 2 men. 1 black guy and 1 white guy. They were both around 6&#39;2&quot;, same build, tall and slender with a little bit of muscle tone. Both had short hair and both of them were dressed the same. Tight fitting jeans, tight fitting leather jackets. </p>

<p>When I acknowledged their presence, both of them looked at me. </p>

<p>This is where it gets strange...</p>

<p>Both of them had similar facial features despite being black and white.</p>

<p>And when I made eye contact, both of them had this sinister smile from ear to ear and their eyes got really big and both stared at me without blinking.</p>

<p>They were staring at me as if they knew what I was thinking about.</p>

<p>I walked passed them and then looked back about half a block down the street and both of them were still staring at me without blinking and both smiling as they crossed the street.</p>

<p>My brain kept flashing images of reptilians while this was going on.</p>

<p>I can&#39;t say for sure that they were reptilians, but it was a strange experience nonetheless.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t believe the ruling class have different DNA, (I mean, unless they know how to repair it, from genetic and environmental disfunction), but are acutely aware of EMF. That&#39;s why certain days, places and objects are important. They understand a science about free energy or something.
