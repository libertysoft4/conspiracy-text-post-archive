        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I cannot prove this.  He just called me.  It is quite interesting.  He told me to check the Google Trends, and yes, there certainly is a &quot;hockey-stick&quot; trend.
I honestly think this is &quot;The Great Global Wake Up&quot; - that is what it should actually be called, as it is much larger than Pizzagate. </p>

<p>We live in interesting times, my friends.</p>

<p>Any thoughts?</p>

<p>EDIT: My apologies, I am new.  Long time browser, second time poster I think.  I appreciate the responses.  Yes, I meant to search &quot;Pizzagate&quot; in Google Trends.</p>

<p>Honestly, I did not think anyone would respond because I do not have any proof, aside from what I was told and to check out Google Trends as direct evidence wen using Pizzagate and related search terms. </p>

<p>Check out when you type in Podesta - yet another spike.  </p>

<p>Keep taking screenshots of key phrases in Google Trends and track them.  They could lead to interesting information, potentially, but certainly reinforce the growth of the movement.</p>

<p>Please capture these if possible.  I do not have time right now.</p>

<p>I felt I could contribute to the cause,  I did my best to help  Please, continue to spread the word to your friends and family.</p>

<p>MORE:
Please see this post as well of mine: <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/5ffo5x/please_help_capture_the_google_trends_of_all/">https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/5ffo5x/please_help_capture_the_google_trends_of_all/</a>
Please Help: Capture the Google Trends of all known Pizzagate keywords - It helps to convince others that they are a part of a large growing movement. Check out the trends over different time periods, as well. It is very interesting. (self.conspiracy) submitted 12 minutes ago * by hillaryclintonseizur <a href="https://www.google.com/trends/explore?date=today%203-m&amp;q=Pizzagate">https://www.google.com/trends/explore?date=today%203-m&amp;q=Pizzagate</a> <a href="https://www.google.com/trends/explore?date=all&amp;q=comet%20ping%20pong">https://www.google.com/trends/explore?date=all&amp;q=comet%20ping%20pong</a> I just thought of this - it makes sense to me, hopefully to you as well: this little pizza joint probably did not receive that much web traffic, UNTIL they planned a sex party. If we follow the Google Trends of &quot;Comet Ping Pong&quot; and other key phrases, we ay be able to put together a schedule of when they planned their sex parties, maybe tie it to missing persons cases, etc. Does anyone out there understand what I am trying to describe? The Google Trends data will lead us directly to spikes when web traffic was heavy, hence a higher likelihood that these alleged pedophiles logged into the site at that time, assuming they used Google to get there. We might even be able to put together a calendar of what went on when it went on through using Google Trends. The potential exists, at least, and we need your help to uncover if this is true. Does this make sense to anyone else out there?</p>

<p>Makes me wonder what happens when, say, the average Russian knows about this? Or is this a huge problem there as well?</p>

<p>Couple other things..</p>

<p>Guess it should be obvious that most people are checking this in the evenings.</p>

<p>Also &quot;pizzagate banned&quot; is the #3 Related Search, so... <em>BACKFIRE!!</em></p>

<p>Yeah man the Great Global Wakeup. The Apocalypse. What a crazy time to be alive.</p>

It&#39;s relevant to foreign adoptions.  Famous actors/musicians, with either admitted or rumored ties to the Illuminati, have adopted foreign children. Like HC, at least one works tirelessly on behalf of children for international organizations.  I know this is going to get down votes but it seems there is a pattern emerging.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m on this sub because I want to believe; it would be so helpful if all the world&#39;s problems could be summed up in a simple theory, even if it&#39;s devotion to a satanic murder cult or something. It&#39;s human nature to look for a simpler explanation like this. Our brains evolved in a way that likes to quantify and define things, it&#39;s what gives us language like we have, so it only makes sense logically to our brains to define the enemy. If there&#39;s a single, real enemy then there&#39;s a single fix for the problem: stop the enemy. It also makes it feel manageable, rather than hopelessly out of our control.</p>

<p>But really all of that is why I think there isn&#39;t some unifying grand conspiracy. Life is insanely complex, with couness causes affecting every person and every decision they make. Honestly, I think people&#39;s propensity for greed and power is nothing new, we&#39;re still just animals. So those billionaires, who could live comfortably for the rest of their lives with only 1% of their lives, don&#39;t keep fighting for more power/wealth/influence for any logical reason; they do it because they&#39;re dumb animals that don&#39;t know any better. Except they&#39;re humans, so they <em>do</em> know better factually, but they can&#39;t stop themselves from instinctively giving in.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No way. You dont get to be a billionaire without being incredibly smart and cunning.</p>

<p>They are far, far away from stupid.</p>

<p>However, this world is like many RPG&#39;s i have played. There isnt just one big bad guy.
There are factions. Lots of them.  The whole pizzagate shenanigans is the work of just one faction.  There are other big bads, other good groups, and then plenty of neutral groups or somewhere inbetween.</p>

<p>There&#39;s so much going on it&#39;s legit impossible to tell what groups desire which ending.  No real way to determine the end goal, because all the shit happening is not done by one faction by itself.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If this is true, then you have to consider one thing: The people implicated in this (whose names we know) like John Podesta or James Alefantis are now liabilities to the other people in the shadows.</p>

<p>As liabilities, they can lead back to a lot of other people whose names we don&#39;t yet know.</p>

<p><em>Powerful</em> people.</p>

<p>Watch for Podesta and Alefantis in upcoming months to have &quot;accidents,&quot; like falling off of buildings, or jumping in front of trains.</p>

<p>(The reality is: They could keep a lid on all the brush fires for decades. They could take out the few random people who knew, like when they assassinated Andrew Breitbart who made a reference to Pizzagate in 2011 before his untimely death. But now that it&#39;s out in the open and hundreds of millions of people around Planet Earth know, a critical mass point is hit. In the changing paradigm certain &quot;loose ends&quot; will have to be taken care of to stanch the bleeding. That means certain players that we know about will now have to be eliminated.) All I&#39;m saying is: Podesta better watch his back. Justice will come to him not from the corrupt criminal justice system (which he thought he rigged in his favor), but from his fellow pedophiles whose cover he&#39;s now jeopardized. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>My apologies, I am new. Long time browser, second time poster I think. I appreciate the responses. Yes, I meant to search &quot;Pizzagate&quot; in Google Trends.
Honestly, I did not think anyone would respond because I do not have any proof, aside from what I was told and to check out Google Trends as direct evidence wen using Pizzagate and related search terms.
Check out when you type in Podesta - yet another spike.
Keep taking screenshots of key phrases in Google Trends and track them. They could lead to interesting information, potentially, but certainly reinforce the growth of the movement.
Please capture these if possible. I do not have time right now.
I felt I could contribute to the cause, I did my best to help Please, continue to spread the word to your friends and family.</p>

<a href="https://www.google.com/trends/explore?date=today%203-m&amp;amp;q=Pizzagate">https://www.google.com/trends/explore?date=today%203-m&amp;amp;q=Pizzagate</a> <a href="https://www.google.com/trends/explore?date=all&amp;amp;q=comet%20ping%20pong">https://www.google.com/trends/explore?date=all&amp;amp;q=comet%20ping%20pong</a>
I just thought of this - it makes sense to me, hopefully to you as well: this little pizza joint probably did not receive that much web traffic, UNTIL they planned a sex party. If we follow the Google Trends of &quot;Comet Ping Pong&quot; and other key phrases, we ay be able to put together a schedule of when they planned their sex parties, maybe tie it to missing persons cases, etc.
Does anyone out there understand what I am trying to describe?
The Google Trends data will lead us directly to spikes when web traffic was heavy, hence a higher likelihood that these alleged pedophiles logged into the site at that time, assuming they used Google to get there.
We might even be able to put together a calendar of what went on when it went on through using Google Trends. The potential exists, at least, and we need your help to uncover if this is true.
Does this make sense to anyone else out there?</p>
