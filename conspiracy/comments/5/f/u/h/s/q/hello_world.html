        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Everyone is being attacked. This is drill for US cyber security command, private sector companies etc</p>

<p>There are hundreds of billions in oil revenue, drugs, defence contracts and money, at stake. Based upon who controls the government. The pedo stuff coming out is basicly a govt coup. The other group who is in power, has reacted by mobilized DSAC and all the public/private resources they are able to.</p>

<p>Most of the assets were moved into the private sector, for intel, data mining and cyber attack/defence. So that these pedo oil drug families could control them. They also own the media and were pushing clinton. There is infighting going on within countries, between the power groups and internationally.</p>

<p>The most secure linux is Void Linux, with MUSL, on an ARM process (not AMD or Intel). So get Raspberry PI 3 and get a void linux box and run bitmessage or whatever on it.</p>

<p>They are doing all sorts of attacks. Every attack in fact. They have system they funded to identify things like decryption keys or document links or pdfs or images from internet and to censor them in real time, by intercepting internet traffic. Their program is massive in scale and has been running for years. They weaponized the whole internet. Everything.</p>

<p>The DNS system, BGP, the fiber interconnects, the ISPs, SSL/HTTPs, Facebook, Reddit, Twitter. They have weaponized everything. They have control from within twitter/reddit and also external control where they can remove content in real time over the wire.</p>

<p>Downloading bitcoin or vpn software, people on windows are reporting the SHA256 hash of the exe they receive do not match. They are live intercepting file downloads and modifying them with backdoors. Then at higher level they are able to backdoor Windows and OSX computers, using the autoupdate functionality if the target is high enough priority.</p>

<p>You have to change your HTTPS private key, every day or hour. They have a timing channel attack, to recover the private key and once they have it, can live intercept traffic. You have to use LibreSSL and host on linux distro not using OpenSSL. The certificate authorities are compromised to. If they do not have the private key, they will just use invalid cert and you will get an error and have to click through.</p>

<p>I could go on for hours about the shit they are doing. The fact that they are not spamming 200 messages a second on Bitmessage again, probably means that they have control of most of the network and message proprogration. They will run 2000 nodes on EC2, then will use their equipment to cut or degrade connections to servers they do not control.</p>

<p>If they see you running an application, they will put you on a list and your computer is automatically targeted for exploitation, to extract your private keys. So that your traffic can be retroactively decrypted. You need to rotate private key frequently (but does not matter too much right now).</p>

<p>I know through friend a computer security person in Phippines who was involved with wikileaks and did penetration testing. He was very low down on chain. He had &quot;accident&quot; then disappeared and police said he died. They may have just paid off the police and kidnapped him. They are going after everyone now, but there are too many people. They cannot van 200,000 people. They have no idea who is running the servers and a lot of it is peer-to-peer, third parties running infrastructure.</p>

<p>ALWAYS USE A VPN. Even if you are using tor, run tor inside the VPN. Paid VPN to country outside of NATO is best thing.</p>

<p>Make sure you are using linux. Linux Mint is good. Turn off Zeitgeist. Disable flash in browser.</p>

<p>Use multiple Virtual Machines. for different things. consider using </p>

<p>The PSYOPs level has been turned up to 11 also. They are spamming threads with idiots. They are designed to lower discussion level or send people down rabbit holes. To dillute information to level where the group cannot effectively function.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Do you think trump is just a part of a different group and they decided to make their move? What ideas do you have on what groups it could be or what their motives are?</p>

<p>Will this stuff be of extreme importance after Dec 1st and rule 41 changes or will it basically be the same as before? How vulnerable is the average internet user without any of these tools on a windows os?</p>

<p>Can you give any hints on what psyops are currently running? What are they trying to distract from? Is it really just the clinton foundation weak points?</p>

<p>Sorry to just post questions however what do you think is the most important topic to push for getting the average person more aware  and to reevaluate what they know?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Your post is a little over my head... does the ELI5 boil down to what I surmised a little while back in <a href="/r/Wikileaks">/r/Wikileaks</a>?</p>

<p>&quot;I think that everyone powerful in the world has doxxed everyone else... and everyone has everyone else&#39;s passwords... and not everyone online is really who they say they are... or even who they used to be. Everyone is co-opting everyone else in a cyber power struggle of epic proportions... manipulative memetic warfare declared on the minds of the masses via mainstream and social media.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>OP, thank you for putting this together. However I am a little concerned about some of the information in your post - <strong>which could be dangerous</strong>! I would request you to review and update:</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Lantern recommendation</strong>: There are some serious issues here. Unless you live in countries that block VPN access, it might be much better to use OpenVPN client and the free servers offered by volunteer networks like VPNGate.com, and maybe then TOR over VPN. </li>
</ol>

<ul>
<li><p>Lantern is just an &quot;anti-blocking&quot; (supposedly <a href="http://techpresident.com/news/wegov/24444/state-department-funded-lantern-next-bigger-better-tor">funded by the State Department</a>) tool and not an anonymity tool at all.</p></li>
<li><p>Lantern reroutes <strong>only blocked</strong> websites, for the rest it does <strong>nothing at all</strong> - thereby giving only the illusion of security while the whole world and alphabet agencies snoop on everything you are doing. From the <a href="https://getlantern.org/faq/index.html">FAQ page</a>: &quot;When a website is not blocked, Lantern gets you there faster by directing you to that website directly, without going through Lantern servers.&quot;</p></li>
<li><p>Requires <a href="https://github.com/getlantern/lantern/wiki/%5Bdevelopers%5D-Questions-and-Answers#-what-about-certificates-isnt-lantern-vulnerable-to-man-in-the-middle-attacks-especially-with-forged-signing-certificates-from-compromised-certificate-authorities">Google Talk to join the network</a> - there you go! What were we really using this thing for? Tell Google we are interested in privacy? WTF!</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Go ahead if you trust the State Department as much as the Lantern founder seems to:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Fisk said the State Department is “incredibly hands off”:
That&#39;s been one fascinating part about working with them, and I think this is incredibly unique to the State Department, but they&#39;re basically like, &#39;Look, we have this mission to spread democracy around the world. This is a part of that mission—this is the non-cynical view, for sure—we&#39;ll just give you this money; we support what you&#39;re doing. You submit quarterly reports and we&#39;ll just let you keep doing your thing.&#39;
He added that the State Department never dictates how they should write Lantern, or how they should talk about it.</p>
</blockquote>

<ol>
<li> <strong>WebRTC leak</strong>: You should add this advisory because most people do not know that Firefox and Chrome happily &quot;leak&quot; your intermediate IP addresses (it&#39;s a &quot;feature&quot; brah) <strong>even if you are using a VPN</strong>.  You thought only your home router knows your LAN IP address? Check for yourself <a href="https://whatismyipaddress.com">https://whatismyipaddress.com</a></li>
</ol>

<p>Thank you for raising awareness about these issues!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So if whatismyipaddress.com shows your VPN IP, I assume this means you&#39;re not leaking?</p>

<p>Also I prefer ifconfig.co (&#39;cause you can curl it - less useful for testing firefox though) and IMO there should be more sites like this.</p>

<p>edit: just checked <a href="https://www.browserleaks.com/webrtc">here</a>. n/a seems good.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You can download the .iso as normal, just make sure the hash matches the hash listed on the download site. Also, torrents might (not 100% sure, would love someone to chime in with more info) be immune to this interception since parts of the file come from all over rather than one source.</p>

<p>I recommend QuickHash, at least on Windows. <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/quickhash/files/v2.6.9/">Here&#39;s</a> a link to the latest version via sourceforge. On linux these hashing algorithms are built-in and you can just do &quot;sha256sum &lt;file&gt;&quot; or similar (md5sum, sha1sum etc) in a shell.</p>

<p>Anyway I hope you enjoy the switch! I set up dual booting but I haven&#39;t been back to Windows 10 for more than 5 minutes since. My main reason for so many years was &quot;linux has no gaems&quot; but now with SteamOS there&#39;s a shitton of converted linux games on Steam. </p>

<p>I&#39;m a fan of the Arch distribution myself (after having tried Ubuntu, Kubuntu, Mint, OpenSUSE, CentOS, and probably more I&#39;m forgetting) basically due to how much support and documentation it has. Seriously, the Arch wiki makes Ubuntu forums look like Neopets&#39; forums, in terms of relevant tech support. Also they make you install it via CLI which really forces you to boost your understanding of how the kernel building, chroot, physical/logical volumes, etc. actually work.</p>
