All the sudden a thought popped in my head...  What if they know an event (Natural or Gov) is going to happen and the fires have been set to stop people from being able to survive/hide/move through those area esp. the densely forested areas or around towns...  What if by burning those areas they lay vast open &quot;catch&quot; zones that are easily patrolled, thereby making monitoring and detaining any type of organized or individual movement less troublesome and would also drive the wildlife out of the area if using heat censoring type equipment like they have on the borders?  I admit I am not sleeping well (I honestly don&#39;t think many of us are these day though) is this a possibility or am I being too vigilant ....?</p>

<p>Limited info coming out.  That viral video of 2 able body guys (thank god they had a truck) got no warning and barely escaped with their lives.  I wonder how many were really killed on that mountain.  </p>

<p>edit:  This was happening in GA and NC prior.  Many reports of arsonists </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thank you for the links!  I have read most of them and I agree there is many troubling aspects to these fires...  Not only would they be clearing the vegetation they would be killing many animals (if not by the fire by starvation) as a result of having the fire.  Any natural edibles would be either killed or severely harmed rendering them useless to those seeking to survive if need be.....  I find these fires equally as concerning as I did the many &quot;chemical plant explosion/fires&quot; that happened all over the world in a very condensed amount of time.... so odd.....</p>

    <div class="md"><p>ooooohhh.. now this is a juicy conspiracy I havent came across yet. First Thank you for not having the words pizzagate in your theory, nice to have a breathe of fresh air every once and a while.</p>

<p>Secondly, I know that Spain suffers from bad fires annually and its a result of arson now whether thats the government organizing it... mmm...</p>

<p>So burning the forests to cut off the escape areas so people don&#39;t run, and scaring away all the animals so heat sensors can detect the ones that do within the catchment areas... interesting thought. </p>

<p>The only &quot;achilles heel&quot; I can think of is the army they going to use. attacking foreign countries in one thing, but when the army turns on its own citizens you run the risk of these guys branching off and creating a rebellion. I know some army folk and as much as they are programmed to do what they told they are still human and most of them are getting quite suspicious themselves on the latest news surfacing from every corner of the globe.</p>

<p>Unless the Elites have some robotic army either fully automated or controlled by the trusted few all seeking the ultimate power of world domination its quite a big risk to take, they&#39;d effectively be trusting on a group of humans that could turn on them at any time. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>quote &quot;attacking foreign countries in one thing, but when the army turns on its own citizens you run the risk of these guys branching off and creating a rebellion&quot; end quote,    I thought about this too and maybe just maybe that&#39;s why our borders are being opened and we have let in so many immigrants (esp those of prime fighting age and gender) ...As has happened before in the past an offer of citizenship for fighting for a cause (theirs) could go out and no loyalty/family ties/ would deter those seeking employment and citizenship from serving against us (US Citizens).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree with you, and I like the thought process but it doesn&#39;t nullify the risk entirely, having an army of foreigners with no ties to citizens, providing them with guns, tanks and ammo to fight the american people is a huge gamble, first there&#39;s still the right to bare arms to think about so its one obstacle that need to go down.</p>

<p>Second, providing citizenship and employment would need to be carefully thought out, coz they could effectively just take it for themselves if they were smart enough. its the power by numbers thing that keeps getting me, even if the majority of people are just dumb followers there&#39;s the intelligent few leaders that surface which awaken the population and ignite the rebellions. </p>

<p>I&#39;ve never been in a position where I&#39;ve had to fight for my own survival, but I can imagine that desperate times calls for desperate measures and history will keep repeating itself as humanity keeps breaking free from the layers of enslavement as we reach the singularity. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That could be the most evil part of the plan...you wouldn&#39;t have much pay due or citizenships needed if both sides annihilate one another...  I hate thinking so negatively but everything I see, read and experience tells me big trouble is on the horizon and our own populace will be our biggest detraction.  I live in a small farming/ranching community and I am as prepared as I can be, yet I know exactly where my greatest threat will come from is not from a foreign army but my own fellow citizens as they plunder their way through communities like mine in search of food or other items for a &quot;short sighted fix&quot;  for their needs and wants.  Everything they will steal or kill for would be gladly shared with them if they participate in providing for those here and who will come...but they are not going to want to &quot;work&quot; for their provisions (at least not at first) they are going to want to take it by any means possible and I (and many like me) will die trying to protect our sustainability....</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My continent evolved to burn. The trees require fire to germinate and emit inflammable chemicals to help that along (trees which Americans decided to import, though mainly in California). Smoke is the smell of summer. Arsonists like fire.</p>

<p>Bushfires happen <em>all over the world</em> when leaf litter is allowed to build up and is dried by summer heat before being struck by lightning, sparked by a cigarette, or lit by a firebug.</p>

<p>Summer conditions are not a government plot. Poor land management is not the government planning for your imminent extermination. Arsonists are not government agents, though quite a lot of them work in the fire brigade and set the very fires they have to put out.</p>
