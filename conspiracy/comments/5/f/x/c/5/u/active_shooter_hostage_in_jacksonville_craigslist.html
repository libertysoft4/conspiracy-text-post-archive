<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/5fqmqx/impending_false_flag_in_jacksonville_fl/">https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/5fqmqx/impending_false_flag_in_jacksonville_fl/</a></p>

<p>They&#39;ve sectioned off 5 blocks and aren&#39;t letting the media view the alleged crime scene. Interviews with bystanders are fishy. And the reporting seems to have a major hard on for the SWAT teams specifically mentioned in the craigslist post.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My bad, I thought it was the image of the girl who was crying on the phone (and they were different people as well).</p>

<p>As far as the image(s) above, there <em>are</em> other images of the principal. Her daughters (who look just like her) have done interviews and given images to girly-magazines with pictures of all 3 of them in it. I think Glamor was one magazine?</p>

<p>As far as her image used as marathon bombing victim? It could have easily been photoshopped, or an honest mistake/misprint at a news station (which would be my guess), or deliberate BS from a conspiracy site trying to cash in on peoples desire for a conspiracy.</p>

<p>There were only a few fatalities in the Boston bombing. 3 iirc, and all of their photos are widely available. And I&#39;ve never seen the principal&#39;s image used as a Boston victim (alive or dead) other than on a conspiracy page that doesn&#39;t have the best record for reliability.</p>

<p>I just don&#39;t consider this evidence of a massive, country-wide cover-up. That would take hundreds, if not thousands, of people to pull off. </p>

<p>Considering how much money someone could make with a story like that? I have a hard time believing not one has ever come forward. For me, that is extremely more unbelievable than a few mentally ill people committing crimes.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Because all I&#39;ve been saying is; I think it&#39;s a <em>huge</em> leap to assume these incidents were faked and they were so sloppy as to use the same photo, of the same woman. </p>

<p>It makes a lot more sense that either someone who is looking for traffic on a conspiracy site photoshopped it (the headline at the bottom of the screen), or it was just simple human error made by someone at a local news station.</p>

<p>The number of people who would have to be involved in something like that, from family members, and family members friends, ect. </p>

<p>For me, i can&#39;t believe there is any way they could get away with it for so long without someone coming forward. Confidentiality agreement (which makes logical sense in a crisis test) or not. Just sayin&#39;.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I completely sympathize with what you&#39;re saying, with a few caveats. There really isn&#39;t a large number of people necessary to be &quot;in&quot; on the secret. An agency like the CIA could have infiltrated the city by moving their agents there. This happens pretty often. All those CIA families need to do is convince their young children to &quot;play along&quot;. They&#39;re children after all and are susceptible to these kinds of mind games.</p>

<p>Add all this to the fact that many of the families homes were purchased for $0 and you&#39;ve got a bona-fide CIA town ready for a psy-op. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>And I can sympathize with yours as well. It&#39;s healthy to question. </p>

<p>That said, there <em>would</em> have to be hundreds if not thousands involved... When you factor in the SWAT, school staff, parents, child actors as students, child actors as siblings of the victims, then all of the survivors friends and their parents and siblings... That&#39;s a <em>LOT</em> of people. And for not one to ever make as much as a peep? </p>

<p>Plus, I know no parent, no matter what their motivation (money, fame, gun control) who would encourage a 6-7 year old to &quot;pretend&quot; they had a murdered sibling and have them play it out for years. The psychological damage would be about the same as losing a sibling, and that kind of trauma creates all types of issues later in life. </p>

<p>Add to that that the older siblings (who would have been old enough to know it was a hoax) would have been teenagers by now. Teenagers frequently <strong>hate</strong> their parents and want to rebel. Yet not one has come forward? Not even with all of the money that could be made if they did? It&#39;s just so unrealistic to me.</p>

<p>As far as the homes being sold for $0. That isn&#39;t what they were sold for, that is what is entered into the system after a divorce or death and the house is transferred into someone else&#39;s name. </p>

<p>Adam Lanza&#39;s mother for example, still had a mortgage. But the property was listed in the city&#39;s system as $0, because it was only a transfer in name, not a sale.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>But if the local police were shut out, and never saw a body, they would be extremely suspicious. I have a hard time believing people at the wakes &amp; funerals who never saw a body, or the siblings who had to &quot;pretend&quot; they lost a sibling, etc, wouldn&#39;t have come forward for the millions that could be made by such claims.</p>

<p>It&#39;s just too far out there for me.</p>

<p>Not even all of the families of the victims of mass shootings advocate for more strick gun control.</p>

<p>In Kalamazoo, for example, the families went to Lansing to advocate... But not for gun control, they were asking for a simple statewide warning system (similar to weather warning systems). </p>

<p>There&#39;s just been <em>soooo much</em> inaccurate information spread on the side of flase-flag believers, idk. I just don&#39;t see these being faked. Especially after <em>knowing</em> one mass shooting was real, yet people all over the internet are claiming it was faked and coming up with ridiculous claims to support it.</p>

<p>I think it&#39;s healthy to ask questions. But it is unhealthy to not have the same suspicions, or &quot;prove it&quot; mentality when it comes to CT sites. Some people believe whatever their favorite host says with no questions asked. And when people start harassing the families of people who have lost loved ones? That&#39;s just too much for me.</p>

It&#39;d look like a tiny bird and then there&#39;s the part where bullets firing up lose velocity significantly fast which means they would have to anticipate where it&#39;s going to be but also the drop on the bullet, the wind change, etc... That&#39;s why they always use massive giant bullets and a shitton of barrels to shoot down airplanes. It&#39;s just so damn hard to hit them and why we switched to missiles super quickly.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>this is what happens when you try to use a drone...</p>

<p><a href="http://www.phillymag.com/news/2016/11/17/drone-arrest-philadelphia/">http://www.phillymag.com/news/2016/11/17/drone-arrest-philadelphia/</a></p>

<p>look at the way they spin it.  the headline of the story is a picture of the guy which tries to make him look like an islamic terrorist, even though he&#39;s clearly italian.</p>

<p>he wasn&#39;t arrested for flying the drone.  Here&#39;s what he was arrested for:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>aggravated assault, causing or risking catastrophe, simple assault, and recklessly endangering another person. According to a police spokesperson, the drone almost collided with the windshield of a police helicopter that was, in fact, monitoring the protests. Police say that no one was injured during the incident.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>all of that is code for:  police were pissed and beat the crap out of him, so they had to charge him with a bunch of trumped up bullshit.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>assuming some events like sandy hook and pulse were inside jobs, it would have more layers of plausible deniability if your &quot;real shooter&quot; is Mk&#39;d and can forget all about what happened or forget he is with the feds and go wild. im not sure the lengths and capabilities MK has gone onto since 1960&#39;s, i can only speculate.</p>

<p>but i imagine these crisis actors stages are for 1 very important actor</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Does this mean in your theory, that crisis actors are used to produce a bigger impact on media and disrupt investigations of real events caused by such MK targets? </p>

<p>Or that actors are paid to perform some sort of street theater around the target, to trigger him or w/e programming or anger he might have, to cause and exploit acts of violence?</p>

<p>It might be interesting to think if  the goal is the state terrorism, the psychological warfare or control over the human mind.</p>

<p>I thought to myself, no way you&#39;re going to back me in a corner &quot;like a sitting duck&quot;.  I engaged him in calm convo as I very slowly walked towards the door.  My thought was it would be much harder for him to hit a moving target.  </p>

<p>Oh, glad you made it out alive from your situation. 
Quick question if I may? Did your perspective of being alive change afterwards and if so, could you measure the difference on a scale, say 1-100? Just curious, hope you aren&#39;t offended, just not very often you run into somebody who has experienced such an event.

I could feel the blood leave my face, must have turned pale.  Survival kicks in, and all I could think of was if I get out the door and run like hell, a moving target is better than a sitting duck.</p>

<p>It took days to get over it.  Had hot buttons installed (It was many years ago).  Honestly, my perspective pretty much stayed the same.  It was very traumatic, and took time to get past it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s just an average robbery-gone-wrong though, right? </p>

<p>I mean, I&#39;ve had friends who were crisis actors, I&#39;ve seen it on local TV, I&#39;ve seen the hospital blocked off while they trained, etc. It servers a legitimate purpose. It happens all the time.</p>

<p>I also live in a town where there was a mass shooting that everyone on social media is convinced was fake... And I can <em>guarantee you</em>, it was not fake. I know people who were killed.</p>

<p>I&#39;m all for questioning media and government (obviously, I&#39;m on a conspiracy site)... But I cannot imagine people who say Orlando didn&#39;t happen, or (even worse) I cannot comprehend what goes through a person&#39;s mind while they repeatedly call and harass grieving families who just lost their kids.</p>

<p>This is a fact that needs to be spead far and wide! Tell it to every person you know who thinks that all of these shooting drill hoaxes are authentic! It was drafted months before Sandy Hook and passed several months after!</p>

<p>Make it your side-mission to tell everyone that it&#39;s legal for our own government to propagandize us with entirely fabricated major news stories as though we were an enemy nation.</p>

<p>Edit: In the 2013 NDAA the Smith-Mundt Act is known by its official name, the US Information and Educational Exchange Act. Just in case you do a word search or whatever.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>when they do something like this, i think they get a real criminal/ crazy person and goad them into the crime, usually with a fake weapon.  it serves as a security drill, while allowing security companies to sell more product.  It causes the public the fear necessary to shove whatever down their throats.</p>

<p>i was curious when it said the swat team didn&#39;t shoot the perp.  AND how did they release the name of one of the employees to the press as the robber?  I wondered how many bank robberies there are and apparently the number is around 5000 a year, with only 25% of those having a gun present.  You also have this taking place in Jacksonville, which as far as i understand is basically a huge military base.</p>

<p>But this is the interesting part:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Because why use a gun when bank tellers are trained to hand over the money without fuss?</p>

<p>&quot;Bank employees are unarmed and consistently compliant,&quot; the justice department states in its bank robbery guide for local police departments. &quot;Even robbery transactions are handled quickly and efficiently.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="http://www.villagevoice.com/news/how-bank-robbery-trends-have-shifted-in-america-over-the-years-6674420">http://www.villagevoice.com/news/how-bank-robbery-trends-have-shifted-in-america-over-the-years-6674420</a></p>

<p>We don&#39;t hear about hostage situations in banks because there&#39;s no reason for them.  99% of bank robbers end up getting caught without any escalation of violence within the bank itself.  You rob a bank and the FBI will find you.  </p>

<p>So this situation DOES become suspicious when a swat team shows up to the bank and a hostage situation happens. That&#39;s not proper procedure anymore.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>He fired his gun during the standoff and ordered all the hostages into a back room, according to police.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>isn&#39;t firing a weapon in a threatening manner its own assault charge?  but that doesn&#39;t show up on his charges.  could that be because the gun wasn&#39;t actually loaded with real bullets?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>According to JSO&#39;s online Inmate Information Search, he is charged with 13 counts of kidnapping, one count of armed robbery and one count of theft of a motor vehicle.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>he&#39;s also a known and recent criminal:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Humphrey, 23, has ties to the Tampa area. He has been arrested in Florida at least twice in 2016. In February in Hillsborough County, he was arrested on a domestic violence charge and released without bond. He was arrested in Jacksonville in September for driving with a suspended license. </p>

<p>Williams said the suspect was not cooperative with investigators earlier today and that <strong>mental illness</strong> may be a factor in the robbery.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>sounds to me like a possible dupe.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Damn, youre totally on point OP. All hostages safe, misreporting about shots fired, suspect identity not revealed.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.nydailynews.com/news/national/bank-robbery-suspect-takes-people-hostage-jacksonville-fla-article-1.2894254">http://www.nydailynews.com/news/national/bank-robbery-suspect-takes-people-hostage-jacksonville-fla-article-1.2894254</a> -- as of 12:23pm</p>

<blockquote>
<p>A suspect held 11 people hostage inside a Jacksonville, Fla. bank Thursday, but later surrendered following an hours-long standoff, authorities said.</p>

<p>The hostages were able to escape to safety after being held hostage for roughly two hours, and the suspect was taken into custody.</p>

<p>The situation occurred after 9 a.m., when the suspect entered a Community First Credit Union location and took people inside hostage, Jacksonville Sheriff&#39;s Office Public Information Officer Melissa Bujeda said.</p>

<p>A caller claimed that one person has been shot — but authorities later said that no shots were actually fired.</p>

<p>SWAT units and hostage negotiators visited the scene and negotiated with the suspect, Bujeda said.</p>

<p>The suspect&#39;s identity has not been revealed.</p>

<p>This story is developing. Check back for updates.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>it really sounds like this was a drill- I&#39;m guessing it was both military and local police/ swat, done with a private contractor.  but they really arrested the guy, so did they find a patsy and set him up to unwittingly do this?</p>

<p>he probably shot two actors with blanks, but the drill wasn&#39;t deep cover enough to pull it off, so they just recanted and said nobody was shot.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is separate from the ad. Family member is an officer with JSO. It&#39;s just a robbery. There was a training exercise by JSO yesterday at a park by me that could be what the ad was asking actors for. I doubt it though. JSO doesn&#39;t normally use civilians in their exercises.</p>

<p>Edit for the down votes: JSO is very involved with the community. They inform us of exercises and training before hand so the public is informed and can be aware if they live or work in the area they use. Nothing is on the radar with JFRD or JSO. So you are looking for a bigger event than a bank robbery, which happens a lot here. Don&#39;t just assume this is what the Craigslist ad is for. I believe the ad is for something else that could happen soon. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Im calling the Somali good boi attack in Ohio another falseflag. Alot of people assume that they only use falseflags to demonize the white rightwingers and they would never fake a muslim attack because the media in pro immigration. I think people are forgetting that they will falseflag both sides to polarize the public via divide and conquer. A good example of this was the Virginia shooter who shot the news presenter lady and Dylan Roof. Both of those were obvious hoaxes and both perpetrators had manifestos written as a justification for their fake crimes. On both sides of the spectrum you&#39;ll get sympathizers reading the manifestos and it radicalizes both groups. The whole racewar thing is another huge psyop. TPTB are salivating over the thought of goyim warring with each other in the streets. All they need is a few more massacres from either a radical black panther type or a white nationalist and then they can pass some more dystopian laws to &quot;keep you safe&quot;. </p>

<p>Remember, the whole alt-right narrative of &quot;its only a falseflag when its a white person&quot; is absolutely retarded because they pin the blame on muslims all the time. Anti-muslim Breitbart tier media narratives benefit Jews and Jews only. </p>

Say someone had some pretty damnning evidence against a high profile gov employee, and that someone also has a CCL. The someone goes to the bank, wait in line, and the cops treat it as a bank robbery, the crisis actors who were also in line at the bank corroborate the police&#39;s story to the news. That someone gets taken into custody, name dragged thru mud, thrown in solitary confinement and silenced down the rabbithole they go.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;d believe it. I&#39;ve heard stories from the SR-71 days. One of the planes was landing at the base, and a group of people without proper clearances happened to be visiting. They were all rounded up and made to wait on the other side of the hanger until the plane was landed and put away. This was after the SR-71&#39;s existence was public knowledge.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>this is what happens when you try to use a drone...</p>

<p><a href="http://www.phillymag.com/news/2016/11/17/drone-arrest-philadelphia/">http://www.phillymag.com/news/2016/11/17/drone-arrest-philadelphia/</a></p>

<p>look at the way they spin it.  the headline of the story is a picture of the guy which tries to make him look like an islamic terrorist, even though he&#39;s clearly italian.</p>

<p>he wasn&#39;t arrested for flying the drone.  Here&#39;s what he was arrested for:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>aggravated assault, causing or risking catastrophe, simple assault, and recklessly endangering another person. According to a police spokesperson, the drone almost collided with the windshield of a police helicopter that was, in fact, monitoring the protests. Police say that no one was injured during the incident.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>all of that is code for:  police were pissed and beat the crap out of him, so they had to charge him with a bunch of trumped up bullshit.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>And I can sympathize with yours as well. It&#39;s healthy to question. </p>

<p>That said, there <em>would</em> have to be hundreds if not thousands involved... When you factor in the SWAT, school staff, parents, child actors as students, child actors as siblings of the victims, then all of the survivors friends and their parents and siblings... That&#39;s a <em>LOT</em> of people. And for not one to ever make as much as a peep? </p>

<p>Plus, I know no parent, no matter what their motivation (money, fame, gun control) who would encourage a 6-7 year old to &quot;pretend&quot; they had a murdered sibling and have them play it out for years. The psychological damage would be about the same as losing a sibling, and that kind of trauma creates all types of issues later in life. </p>

<p>Add to that that the older siblings (who would have been old enough to know it was a hoax) would have been teenagers by now. Teenagers frequently <strong>hate</strong> their parents and want to rebel. Yet not one has come forward? Not even with all of the money that could be made if they did? It&#39;s just so unrealistic to me.</p>

<p>As far as the homes being sold for $0. That isn&#39;t what they were sold for, that is what is entered into the system after a divorce or death and the house is transferred into someone else&#39;s name. </p>

<p>Adam Lanza&#39;s mother for example, still had a mortgage. But the property was listed in the city&#39;s system as $0, because it was only a transfer in name, not a sale.</p>

<p>(Edit- I don&#39;t know why my autocorrect always capitalizes &quot;death&quot;.</p>
