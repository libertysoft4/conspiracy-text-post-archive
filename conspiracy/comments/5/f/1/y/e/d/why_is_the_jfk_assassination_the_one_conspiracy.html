<p>Why is the public so accepting of questioning that, but anything else makes you look like an unhinged nut?</p>

<p>It&#39;s interesting to me.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, the fact he was yelling about being a patsy was really creepy. You&#39;d figure if he really did assassinate the president, that he&#39;d at least be motivated by some fanatical purpose that he&#39;d preach about. I don&#39;t see any logical reason for him to have yelled about being a patsy unless he was crazy enough to think that would somehow get him off the hook.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Its never nutty to question the official lies.   What gets nutty is when people waste a bunch on time on alternative theories that are nutty.</p>

<p>There are so many decent investigators,  but conspiracy nuts would often rather mix themselves up with the kooky people who make a living from tantalizing tidbits of fringe material that is a disservice to the goal of getting average people to be willing to question the official lies.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, because it is so ridiculous. 
I believe they had a government comittee on assassination that admitted there was likely a conspiracy, but they didnt name possible suspects.</p>

<p>I could be wrong on this, im just going off internet, other tab toooo farrr. 
Watch 50 reasons for 50 years on youtube.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Actually I&#39;ve seen people become reinforced (believing the single gunman theory) recently - primarily because of the NOVA special.  It seemed like for years friends of mine and others were stating to accept the possibility of multiple gun men but after the NOVA program, they seem renewed in their confidence of the lone gun man theory.  Ugh</p>
