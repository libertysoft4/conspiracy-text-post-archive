<p><strong>A day after the elections an iPhone update was released</strong> and everything stopped. I tried to look into what the release changed and apple did not say what it was in the release notes. (Tin foil hat stuff I know)</p>

<p>[edit] all I can describe it like was, it felt like that lingering sound you hear after you shoot a pistol without ear protection.. that constant high frequency buzz more subtle but def like that.. It was annoying as fuck feeling that feeling constantly. Weird shit  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>R.N.M. works remotely (ever wondered why have we all been driven relentlessly towards wireless systems?) to control the brain under the objective to detect any criminal thought taking place inside the mind of a possible culprit.  Inevitable question: How can you isolate a criminal thought if you do not have a comparative measure of non-criminal thoughts?</p>

<p>This undertaking is based on two principles:</p>

<p>The research studies have shown that the humanoid intellect thinks at a speed of about 5 kilobits per second and, therefore, does not have the capability to contest with supercomputers acting via satellites, implants and biotelemetry.
The human brain has a characteristic set of bioelectric resonance structure. By using supercomputers, the R.N.M. system can home in on it, and send messages through an embedded individual’s nervous system in order to affect their performance in a preferred way.
The entire system has been developed</p>

<p>False. Since you posted in a sub that is not a targeted individual sub, you need to define your abbreviations. Don&#39;t be lazy. Either define or don&#39;t use abbreviations. Type out the words.</p>

<p>RNM is the abbreviation for remote neural monitoring. RNM does not induce humming. RNM is solely remotely monitoring brain EEG waves and thoughts. See the remote neural monitoring wiki in <a href="/r/targetedenergyweapons">/r/targetedenergyweapons</a>.</p>

<p>Humming can be induced by:</p>

<p>(1) ultrasound hearing. See the ultrasound weapons wiki in <a href="/r/targetedenergyweapons">/r/targetedenergyweapons</a>. </p>

<p>0r  </p>

<p>(2) Microwave auditory effect.  See DEW: microwave auditory effect wiki in <a href="/r/targetedenergyweapons">/r/targetedenergyweapons</a>.</p>

<p>They&#39;re creating a dependence system with people and their <em>fucking</em> phones. (sorry, but I really can&#39;t stand seeing people with their heads down and on their phones all the time. Not EVERYONE, but man......). </p>

<p>Eventually, I think, people&#39;s health will be come dependent on their smart phones (or rather, anything with the &quot;Smart&quot; label in front of it). Maybe in a couple of generations the effects will show a bit more. </p>

<p>They can also use secret weaponry to make us ill,this is a real thing.</p>

<p>So what are you going to do ?</p>

<p>Nothing you can do?</p>

<p>On the other hand if there is even a tiny chance that what you are experiencing is mental health related,you could rid yourself these symptoms with a simple course of pills.</p>

<p>I mean are you going to sit around feeling like this?</p>

<p>Obviously you have to do something,you can&#39;t go on like this.</p>

<p>If it is the government you would need to get proof and pursue legal avenues possibly media,i don&#39;t really know,it would be a long and complex difficult thing to prove.</p>

<p>You need to speak to a doctor or a family member you trust.</p>

<p>You must rule out any chance of mental illness before you do anything else</p>

<p>Get some medication and treatment even if you dont think anything is wrong and if you still feel like this after treatment then you will know it is real and can decide what action to take.</p>

<p>We also sprayed chemtrails, some of which had dangerous club moss lycopodium spores that cause a cancerlike growth when it gets into cuts.  They sprayed off the coast of charleston and it dispersed over 3 states and settled onto populations, unknowingly.  That&#39;s human experiementation in my book.  You may call it somehting different.</p>

<p>The problem with saying the people were volunteers or on the payroll is that these people did not know what they were getting into and were dosed with serious drugs that screwed them up forever.  Also, the CIA redacted stuff and has been caught lying before, so we really don&#39;t know if those prostitutes were knowingly &quot;on the cia payroll&#39; or just paid by &#39;random johns&#39;</p>

<p>Absolutely false. Targets were chosen randomly for LSD dosage and monitoring of interaction with prostitutes trying to get them to divulge information at several safe house. Read about Operation Midnight Climax. I would say the majority of MKUltra victims were chosen randomly. Some happened to be institutionalized for reasons such as depression when Ewen Cameron practiced psychic driving on them- leaving some permanently comatose. </p>

<p>Chosen at random. That was the only criteria. Dr. Ewen Cameron (head of the APA and WPA) &quot;chose&quot; his victims by the criteria that they were admitted into a psych hospital. These victims weren&#39;t picked for personal reasons.  People who think they&#39;ve been singled out for torture bc they wrote an angry op-ed piece for their local newspapers are delusional. </p>

<p>No. I am not a fan of your subreddit. We&#39;ve been through this before. I have said you run it like a little dictator, making rules about how many times I can cite my site. If you really want the truth to get out, you&#39;d ask if you could put my site in the sidebar. Because you have not read it, I, once again, have to correct you about MKUltra 101 information.</p>

<p>The information in that subreddit is frequently wrong and is not based on real research. It cites sources like Thomas. Then, when someone who has actually read Tomas corrects you, you say Thomas&#39; ideas are ridiculous. You think you can shield yourself. You refuse to read actual research I recommend to you and you ask that I take you by the hand and show you things of interest one at a time. I made my website so I don&#39;t have to do that.</p>

<p>“MKULTRA Subproject 119 was a literature review which included a summary of existing information on “Techniques of activation of the human organism by remote electronic means.” What a coincidence that I, and so many others, were told we were “activated.” According to a report in Defense Electronics, [64] consideration was given to using non-lethal weapons technology on David Koresh during the Branch Davidian siege in the spring of 1993. P. 105 Research on the ability of magnetic fields to facilitate the creation of false memories and altered states of consciousness is apparently funded by the Defense Intelligence Agency through the project cryptonym SLEEPING BEAUTY. “Sleeping Beauty was a Defense Department study of remote microwave mind-influencing techniques.” [65] P. 116“ Much more information below:</p>

<p>Proof CIA created mind-controlled assassins that would not even remember that they killed</p>

<p>Another document dated 10 Feb 1954 describes an experiment on the creation of unsuspecting assassins: “Miss [deleted] was instructed (having previously expressed a fear of firearms) that she would use every method at her disposal to awaken miss [deleted] (now in a deep hypnotic sleep). Failing this, she would pick up a pistol and fire it at Miss [deleted]. She was instructed that her rage would be so great that she would not hesitate to ‘kill’ [deleted]. Miss [deleted] carried out these suggestions including firing the (unloaded) gun at [deleted], and then proceeded to fall into a deep sleep. After proper suggestions were made, both were awakened. Miss [deleted] expressed absolute denial that the foregoing sequence had happened.” (CIA Mori ID 190691, 2/10/54)</p>

<p><a href="http://www.wanttoknow.info/emailmk">http://www.wanttoknow.info/emailmk</a></p>

<p>The above info is from my website. You would be exponentially more educated on this subject you spend so much time on if you actually read it, instead of complaining about its format. </p>

<p>Another reason I don&#39;t want to co-mod your sub is that you ignore my requests to read real research, and over and over again, I have to correct you. I wouldn&#39;t have to do this if you took 20 minutes to read my research- let alone Dr. Duncan&#39;s books. Oh, you&#39;ll criticize them, but not read them. That&#39;s hypocritical.</p>

<p>In wanttoknow.info they list other MKUltra subprojects. Some have goals like, &quot;Can we seize a subject and get him to crash a plane using hypnosis?&quot; &quot;Can we get a subject to act against his or her own better judgement, even if it means their death?&quot;</p>

<p>Here, because you are so remarkably lazy and will almost certainly not do your own research:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Project Artichoke began in 1951, with a scope of ... “Can we get control of an individual to the point where he will do our bidding against his will and even against fundamental laws of nature, such as self-preservation?</p>

<p>Can we in a matter of an hour, two hours, one day, etc., induce an hypnotic condition in an unwilling subject to such an extent that he will perform an act for our benefit? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Can we create by post-hypnotic control an action contrary to an individual&#39;s basic moral principles?

<p>making rules about how many times I can cite my site</p>

<p>The initial rule was everyone who promoted their blogsite, website or youtube channel could do it once. I was enforcing Reddit&#39;s rule on self promotion. I revised the rule due to numerous self promoting posts by other TIs. The revised rule is unlimited self promotion in exchange for referring the sub and the survey questionnaire. Reciprocation is fair.</p>

<p>You had complied. You had unlimited self promotion as long as your website keeps referring the sub and the survey questionnaire. However, you didn&#39;t link post to your blogsite. You removed the suvey questionnaire. </p>

<p>The information in that subreddit is frequently wrong and is not based on real research. </p>

<p>I cite sources. People can debate. </p>

<p>It cites sources like Thomas. Then, when someone who has actually read Tomas corrects you, you say Thomas&#39; ideas are ridiculous. </p>

<p>You used the plural term of ideas not me. I agreed that one of Marshall Thomas&#39; ideas was ridiculous. I linked to a blog that linked to a page from Marshall Thomas&#39; book on reasons why people are targeted. You didn&#39;t dispute that. I included his reasons in the survey questionnaire. If you don&#39;t think the reasons are correct, submit a post explaining why and I may remove his reasons from the survey questionnaire.</p>

<p>Several times, I have stated I will read Robert Duncan&#39;s books and finish reading your blogsite. A critique of a chapter or a page of a book can be correct without needing to read the entire book. <a href="/u/daryatash">/u/daryatash</a> quoted Robert Duncan.

<p>Directed energy weapons</p>

<p>It could be some sort of microwave weapon, there&#39;s plenty of precedence for that. We have devices that emit microwave radiation (which excites molecules, causing energy to build up and cook the food), available to the public, and have had them in excess of 30 years. </p>

<p>Microwave radiation gives off electromagnetic frequences when emmited, as will the device being used to emit them. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Active_Denial_System">This reminds me of the military&#39;s Active Denial System</a>, that uses microwave radiation to heat up the water inside of your skin, and cause debilitating pain. Like you&#39;re being cooked.</p>

<p>The only difference between the two is the exact frequency used, as the military&#39;s public &#39;nonlethal&#39; version isn&#39;t capable of penetrating deep tissue. I believe that your heart rate increase could be caused by a vasovagal response to the trauma caused by such a device.</p>

<p>If you found the right materials, you could attempt to build a faraday cage, and hide it underneath a hoodie and pants. Or pajamas, as it seems you&#39;re being targeted at night. If you can, try and shield the whole room, and hole up inside. They could attempt to gain access to use this device against you.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Did you test the EMF meter under a control situation--maybe give it to a friend and have them read it in the middle of a field or something?</p>

<hr/>

<p>One thing you can try that is inexpensive is to get mylar sheets (or aluminum foil), hang them in a small area in your house with banana clips clipped to the ground wire (middle lower wire) of the wall to ground it (easiest to cut an old 3 prong cord and tape off the 2 sides and connect the banana clip to the bottom one (usually green or green-yellow striped), but best to just trace it to the ground prong)</p>

<p>Then retest with your emf meter and see if it reduces the readings.  You can get more expensive and complex with it by adding a layer of tight weave steel hardware cloth, building a more official faraday cage.  </p>

<p>You can get this from home depot and just try it out (again hooking it to the single wall ground wire), and if it doesn&#39;t work to greatly reduce the emf, then just return it.</p>

<p>Best to run a copper speaker wire through a window to a steel stake in the earth. </p>

<p>I submitted a shielding report that wearing three mylar ponchos did not shield maser and laser attacks. Aluminum shields electromagnetic fields very poorly.</p>

<p>Earthing does help. I earth every day by walking barefoot or in earthing shoes on grass at a park.  Wiring a blanket, sleeping bag, sleeping mat, floor mat below a computer, etc. are good ways to earth if the wiring is connected to a stake in the earth.</p>

I have taken magnesium and it got rid of visual migraines and neck tension. The tinnitus is still there, but I am around EMF fields at work (generators). </p>

<p>Also, when I type on my iphone my left hand goes numb. I tend to talk with the phone on my left ear, and get neck tension on the left side.</p>

<p>I am going to try updating the iOS to see if that makes any difference. </p>

<p>Please cite your source by quoting Marshall Thomas and give the page number.  My post linked to a portion of Marshall Thomas&#39; book in which he analyzed the criteria the CIA used to select subjects for their projects. You need to be clear you had not  refuted that.

<p>You had not asked me to read omnisense&#39;s blogsite. Yesterday, was the first time you discussed omnisense&#39;s blogsite.</p>

<p>I entered &quot;omnisense manchurian candidate&quot; in ixquick.com&#39;s search engine. No blog on manchurian candidates from omnisense.org came up. The blogsite does not have a search engine. The table of contents are partially hidden with large pin wheels. Omnisense self defeated his blogs by covering them up with pin wheels.</p>

<p>Since you initially conducted research, finding the sources should be easy and quick for you. What is your problem?</p>

<p>We are not having a private conversation. You demand the 407,114 subscribers of <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> and me to blindly believe you unless they read your entire blogsite. You never link to a particular article or blog on your blogsite. You merely link to your entire blogsite.</p>

<p>I have submitted hundreds of posts, many of them medical papers. I am not lazy.</p>

<p>Stop lying I haven&#39;t read the research you begged me to read. I have read some. You referred Eleanor White&#39;s book on shielding but would not submit a link post. I submitted the link post. We discussed her book.</p>

<p>Regarding Aaron Alexis, Omnisense provided no evidence that he was mind controlled. Aaron Alexis was not.</p>

<p>The only TI Omnisense mentioned that possibly was mind controlled was Myron May. The other people he mentioned are not TIs. Myron May gave several reasons. A separate post on him would be a better place to debate.</p>

<p>I do read the papers and articles I cite. In this post, I cited Omnisense description of his documentary solely because <a href="/u/shinzantetsu">/u/shinzantetsu</a> brought it up and had not cited it:</p>

<p>Ridiculous. This is a stated MKUltra goal. </p>

<p>The driver in Kalamazoo stated he became possessed by an electronic Satan. Jared Loughner became obsessed with mind control. Myron May said he was a victim and that&#39;s why he was going on his shooting spree. 
Many victims have experienced this possession by an electronic SATAN (silent assassinations through amplified neurons). It&#39;s written about extensively in The Matrix Deciphered (free to read online), which, for reasons I can only speculate on, you refuse to read. Hundreds of victims were surveyed and studied in the research phase of that book and it provides a lot of insight, yet you ignore it time and time again.</p>

<p>Do some real research. At the minimum read all the mind control info at <a href="http://www.wanttoknow.info">www.wanttoknow.info</a>. They&#39;ve uncovered many of the goals for MKUltra. Creating programmed killers was a goal that was repeatedly stated in CIA literature.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My statement &quot;The goals of torturers is not to create manchurian candidates&quot; applies to the present. Targeted individuals are not mind controlled to murder.</p>

<p>What is it stated that a goal of MK-ULTRA was to create Manchurian candidates? Which articles from wanttoknow.info?</p>

<p>PROJECT MK-ULTRA occurred decades ago. No targeted individual claimed that they are a Manchurian candidate. No TI who murdered stated they were going to murder because of mind control. Alexis and Myron May murdered because they were being fast killed.</p>

<p>What driver in Kalamazoo?</p>

<p>Where does it say Jared Loughner was a Manchurian candidate?</p>

<p>Myron May was not a Manchurian candidate. Myron May was being fast killed by directed energy weapons. Not having knowledge of shielding, he suicided himself. He wanted to bring awareness. To create publicity, he murdered. Myron May never stated he was mind controlled to murder.</p>

<p>Edit:</p>

<p>Your interpretation of SATAN (silent assassinations through amplified neurons) is completely different from other TI&#39;s interpretation. SATAN is not satanic possession. The footnote Robert Duncan gave for SATAN was #4 which was undisclose source. Robert Duncan did not create the theory of SATAN based on interviewing victims:</p>

<p>[Perps: Goals] [Brain Zapping] <a href="/u/curiosity36">/u/curiosity36</a> interpreted &quot;silent assassination through amplified neurons&quot; (SATAN) as satanic possessed manchurian candidate. Brian Tew interpreted SATAN as the target is assassinated by remote brain zapping.</p>

<p>You literally want me to hold your hand. Do a little actual research, read the mind control sections of wanttoknow.info. Read their material about Project Bluebird. There you will see that there were stated MKUltra goals about creating hypnotized assassins that wouldn&#39;t even remember they killed. They even have documents obtained through the FOIA that proved they were successful in this undertaking!</p>

<p>You would know all this if you read my website. All documentation is there. You should really know these things. This is introductory material to the subject.</p>

<p><em>Killer driver told cops the devil possessed him through Uber app</em></p>

<blockquote>

<p>Nowhere does it say that, however, if you were up to snuff on your research, you would definitely have that impression. Laughner underwent a complete identity change, started asking his profs if true mind control was possible, and (again with the Satan angle) built a shrine to Satan in his yard. I go into all this on my site, and you should have read it by now. It frustrates me constantly having to retype things for you bc you can&#39;t be bothered to read a 2 page website.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>To create publicity, he murdered. Myron May never stated he was mind controlled to murder.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Truly brainwashed people don&#39;t know they&#39;re brainwashed. What May did say though was that his handlers were promising him his freedom if he went on a shooting spree. He said he was mind-controlled and then offered peace through killing. Then he killed. That sounds like a Manchurian to me. You would know this about May if you researched properly. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Mayron May asked that in the Facebook group Targeted Individuals International. I don&#39;t do Facebook. You do. What was the response? Did other TIs admit being mind controlled to become a manchurian candidate? If not, then this is not a goal of perps.</p>

<p>I will include in the survey questionnaire whether TIs believe they are manchurian candidates.</p>

<p>One and a half years ago, I read his suicide letter in which he gave a different reason:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>but my goal is to garner some much-needed media attention to the plight of targeted individuals because we are a marginalized group with few financial assets. Coincidentally, that means we get ignored.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="http://www.myronmaysflashdrive.com/">http://www.myronmaysflashdrive.com/</a></p>

<p>He also gave the reason that energy weapons were strongly attacking his chest and that he didn&#39;t believe he would survive for long.</p>

<p>No other TI who were fast killed by directed energy weapons has murdered claiming they were mind controlled to do it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>If the <a href="/u/shinzantetsu">/u/shinzantetsu</a> referred Covert Transhumanism because it discussed manchurian candidates, he needed to have said that and quoted or cited an URL.</p>

<p>You had not asked me to read omnisense&#39;s blogsite. Yesterday, was the first time you discussed omnisense&#39;s blogsite.</p>

<p>I entered &quot;omnisense manchurian candidate&quot; in ixquick.com&#39;s search engine. No blog on manchurian candidates from omnisense.org came up. The blogsite does not have a search engine. The table of contents are partially hidden with large pin wheels. Omnisense self defeated his blogs by covering them up with pin wheels.</p>

<p>Since you initially conducted research, finding the sources should be easy and quick for you. What is your problem?</p>

<p>We are not having a private conversation. You demand the 407,114 subscribers of <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> and me to blindly believe you unless they read your entire blogsite. You never link to a particular article or blog on your blogsite. You merely link to your entire blogsite.</p>

<p>I have submitted hundreds of posts, many of them medical papers. I am not lazy.</p>

<p>Stop lying I haven&#39;t read the research you begged me to read. I have read some. You referred Eleanor White&#39;s book on shielding but would not submit a link post. I submitted the link post. We discussed her book.</p>

<p>Regarding Aaron Alexis, Omnisense provided no evidence that he was mind controlled. Aaron Alexis was not.</p>

<p>The only TI Omnisense mentioned that possibly was mind controlled was Myron May. The other people he mentioned are not TIs. Myron May gave several reasons. A separate post on him would be a better place to debate.</p>
