    <div class="md"><p>Their wikipedia page is disingenuous.  They announced a partnership with Yahoo 6 months or more ago and it&#39;s very clear that&#39;s when DDG started to be ABSOLUTELY TERRIBLE ...basically unusable in their results.  DDG used to be context sensitive, and then suddenly it was lycos-like in its results, which I tested side by side to verify.  Yep, mostly lycos dumb token matching.  This type of search capability  step-back can only mean it was intentionally thrown under the bus.  Which means it was bought, because DDG staff won&#39;t stand idly by for a degradation of their service if they have anything to say about it.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s my conpisracy theory: Google paid Yahoo! &#39;a little something extra&#39; to buy DDG and then turn it into a noncompetitor.  It did this so it would not appear Google was dominating the internet search sector.  Yahoo! needed this money because Marissa Meyer kept fucking up with stagnant share price for 3 yrs...ignoring her key security experts warnings, and instead invested heavily on a Yahoo! mail facelift and tumbler and some video adventures that failed to produce....they were told to sell Yahoo or lose Meyer by financial experts so they were in deep trouble, so they punted...I believe--with an injection of money to partner with and eventually aquire DDG.  Google helped them out because it served their interests too...and they know Meyer was a clod on a sinking ship, so they handed her a couple of bars of gold on her way down.  She accepted seeing the value and not the downward acceleration</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well I did it and there were several about the pipe line. Now it was the fourth one down, but it appears that because news is sorted more toward newest first rather than most relevant first. (Not necessarily horrible for a new search tab to do) </p>

<p>So maybe you just did it at a time where there was several new stories about protests that were just posted that were also not about the pipeline. </p>

<p>Duck duck go is a weaker search engine because it has less meta data than google. Google has an algorithm that get better the more people use it and so do most other sites this is why bing is better for porn because more people use it for porn, or rather a higher percentage of its users are using it for porn. </p>
