        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Esteban Santiago had his first federal court appearance today and this is what MSM is saying: </p>

<p>Esteban says CIA controlled his mind and implanted voices in his head telling him to kill. MSM says by Esteban surrendering to the police after the shooting proves he knew what he did was wrong. </p>

<p>Today&#39;s technology with super computers and artificial intelligence software has revolutionized the development. Most technology is classified and only a few patents registered. The latest was in 2002 when voice to Skull was patented. Today&#39;s technology enables a 2 way communication with the brain with voices and images (holograms). Pentagon says the brain is like a huge computer without a firewall. It&#39;s all about the electric signals going to and from the brain. This technology is according to the experts the most important invention since the nuclear bomb</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/shared?ci=61haq7-QyDE">Voice to Skull explained by Dr. John Hall</a></p>

<p>Did Esteban break through his MK Ultra after he killed all these people and surrendered? The MK assassins are suppose to follow through their program and self terminate after the operation is finished... this DID NOT HAPPEN. 
I.e Kanye West broke through his MK Ultra for 17 minutes  during his concert and spoke truth. </p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/shared?ci=c_ybKkTtP5I">Mk Ultra Explained</a></p>

<p>It&#39;s no secret the government uses MK Ultra in Hollywood. Did the CIA use Hollywood celebs for their first group of guinea pigs before they started producing assassins to pull off mass shootings for their special &quot;gun control&quot; agenda? </p>

<p>Steven Seagal knows the dark secrets of hollywood and he stands behind the Second amendment and Constitution. He believes the CIA is engineering mass shootings with MKultra to push harsher gun laws and eventually will take our guns away. </p>

<p>A Famous saying is HISTORY REPEATS ITSELF... </p>

<p>In 1933, the ultimate extremist group, led by Adolf Hitler, seized power and used the records to identify, disarm, and attack political opponents and Jews. Constitutional rights were suspended, and mass searches for and seizures of guns and dissident publications ensued. Police revoked gun licenses of Social Democrats and others who were not “politically reliable.”</p>

<p>During the five years of repression that followed, society was “cleansed” by the National Socialist regime. Undesirables were placed in camps where labor made them “free,” and normal rights of citizenship were taken from Jews. The Gestapo banned independent gun clubs and arrested their leaders. Gestapo counsel Werner Best issued a directive to the police forbidding issuance of firearm permits to Jews.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.nationalreview.com/article/365103/how-nazis-used-gun-control-stephen-p-halbrook">Hilter and Gun Control </a></p>

<p>The NWO needs control of our guns first before they can take complete control of America. </p>

<p>I live in Texas and we love our guns! Last year there were a lot of military exercises in towns with tanks, and talks about FEMA camps etc  We feared obama was going to declare martial law before leaving office so everyone I know bought more guns and ammo and was literally ready to put up a fight. </p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/shared?ci=2G1W8rbxOSU">Obama shows his anger towards Texans and their guns</a></p>

<p>Obama obviously doesn&#39;t like how Texans are all about their guns bc we are making it hard for him to push his &quot;gun control&quot; agenda. </p>

<p>Let me ask you this... how did the government get the mass population to agree with invading Afghan and Iraq? 
Organizing the biggest false flag of them all... 9/11. 
After 9/11 majority of the masses agreed to go to war! 
History repeats itself... the government is turning to false flags AGAIN to help convince the mass population to agree...WE NEED GUN CONTROL! </p>

<p>Just go to twitter and search hashtag <a href="https://sli.mg/IGt3yn">#FortLauderdale </a> and you will see all the sheeple screaming for GUN CONTROL! Gtfo sheep</p>

<p>If you think The elites are gonna surrender and drop their NWO agenda bc Trump won... you&#39;re crazy. Trump has the right words but so did JFK and you see what they did with him. So, what will make a difference? Us... the people! We need to push the TRUTH out to the mass sheeple and wake them the f up. </p>

<p>The CIA experiments on the US citizens with voice to Skull. Targeted individuals testimonies below: 
FYI this isn&#39;t schizophrenia bc schizophrenia develops at a young age, 20 or younger, and these people are older who are hearing voices in their head. </p>

<p>A group of residents of Richmond Cali went to the city council and won their case. City council ruled.. electomagnet weapons are banned from this city </p>

<p>If the CIAs MKUltra and Voice to Skull program is exposed during the Fort Lauderdale shooting case, then the mass sheeple will wake up and their NWO agenda will CRUMBLE. </p>

<p>Maybe we should drill Julian ( AMA Jan 10, 2017 ) to release  CIA documents on MK and voice to Skull? Anddd 9/11 docuements ha </p>

<p>EDIT: Many countries are involved with developing electromagnet weapons. They are like the new toy all the countries are Getty about. So, how far will they go? I&#39;ve noticed  &quot;weapons in space&quot; in the news lately and always referred them to nuclear type weapons. What if the countries agreed putting Electromagnet weapons in space so they can control the whole planet? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Trump is part of the elite ruling class, he is not your champion just another rich guy trying to help himself and other wealthy people. Before you come back with a political response do you have a link on those Kanye 17 minutes and anything else on celebrity MKUltra projects? I haven&#39;t heard to much about that and I am very very intrigued.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t &quot;trust&quot; him. </p>

<p>But the main stream media has been going absolutely crazy over him... to the point that previously respected news outlets have taken enormous risks. The actions by the media (and the big business elites that fund it) seem to be actions of fearful organizations. The fact that these elements seem to be afraid is somewhat encouraging.</p>

<p>On the other hand, I&#39;ve seen some interviews with Cheney... and he seems completely smitten by Trump. And even seems to boast about Trumps tweeting as a way to bypass traditional media. (I think he said something like &quot;<strong>we</strong> don&#39;t need them anymore&quot;).... the &quot;we&quot; part of that sentiment scares me... as does the authoritarian and militaristic aspects to his politics and personnel. </p>

<p>Who the fuck knows though.  Alls I know is that I am glad we have:</p>

<ul>
<li>Crapshoot that is trump (and the corresponding newfound vigilance and suspicion from the left) </li>
</ul>

<p>OVER</p>

<ul>
<li>Worst of both worlds Hillary (Militarism + Identity politics on steroids) with an impotent right wing and liberals patting themselves on the back while we bomb civilians until infinity</li>

A few hundred factory jobs or cheaper products that more people can afford? Tough argument for either side and idk enough about macro-economics to make a judgement so we shall see. As for the wall it&#39;s going to cost the taxpayer billions and will take 15 years to finish so there&#39;s literally no guarantee it gets done, the whole &quot;Mexico will pay for it&quot; thing won&#39;t happen, even taxes on imports coming in would only raise costs for the consumer, and even if the US government gets the money back what will assure that the taxpayer is reimbursed? Nothing. Even if they get the full amount back from Mexico it&#39;ll just belong to the government. Trump has shown I his professional life that he has only looked out for himself, actions speak louder than words so that&#39;s what I expect from him as a president. Finally, he&#39;s not putting anyone in the establishment in jail, if he does you can reply to this comment again and say I told you so all the live long day. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>i think the MSM are just in the seven stages of grief for having failed at the task they&#39;d been paid to do, and which their hubris never let them doubt they could do:</p>

<p>ensure trump was the rep candidate with unprecedented free coverage, and relatively mild commentsry during the primary, then knock him flat in the general. they failed as magnifcently as clinton did, and they truly seem to have never even seen it coming...a very emperor&#39;s new clothes sort of thing.</p>

<p>trump is an elite. but he&#39;s one of the check writing class of elites, like all of the media mogals who backed clinton, not the check receiving elites like clinton and the MSM talking heads, who backed her (as much because their bosses said so as not).</p>

<p>trump doesn&#39;t care about the little guy. if that was the only issue, no other elites or powerbrokers like the CIA would care. trump only cares about trump. that&#39;s why they care.</p>

<p>the elites care about him because they know the check writing class is caprious, unruly, and unmangeable...they&#39;re always happy to get money from people, but they pull any strings attached right off and toss them back at the giver, unlike the check receivers, who tie those stri gs arou d their wrists like kabalah strings.</p>

As far as what they&#39;d have to gain is influencing the culture and having someone under their thumb who is at the forefront of hip hop would be a huge way to influence a whole lot of people with propaganda that they probably couldn&#39;t reach otherwise.

    <div class="md"><p>Using a VPN with Tor adds very little as far as I can tell. Main risks when using Tor:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Timing/traffic correlation attacks to determine the source of the traffic. If that&#39;s a risk you are facing, it&#39;s likely from a state intelligence service, and I suspect the same traffic analysis techniques could be used to find a VPN user (especially as using a VPN gives a more or less fixed endpoint that can be tampered with if required)</p></li>
<li><p>Malicious content (malware etc.) being added to requested webpages by compromised exit nodes. Using a VPN does nothing to prevent that - the exit node can still tamper with any unencrypted traffic, and if you are vulnerable to the exploit used it doesn&#39;t really matter how it reaches you.</p></li>
<li><p>Accidentally revealing identifying information in traffic visible to the exit node - this can range from logging into a known account, or even just searching for the weather in a given town. The former is an obvious risk, and would enable any exit node operator to ID you if they wanted. The latter requires passive mass surveillance, but if you appear to be connected to a specific town and only, say, 20 people were using Tor from that town at that time, your anonymity is easily lost unless you are exceedingly careful. Again, the VPN doesn&#39;t really add anything - if those sort of tells are visible to an exit node, it doesn&#39;t really matter how they get there. </p></li>

    <div class="md"><p>Think of it this way. The gov&#39;t spymasters know every trick in the book. As a general way of keeping your info from being intercepted by third parties, TOR + VPN = best you can do. Data collection agencies and such have less access to your info. But the spymasters are using the same tech they use to track spies and terrorists to track you, and you can bet your life that they have cracked any commercially available way of hiding communication over the internet.</p>

<p>If you worked for them, what would be a high priority? To infiltrate TOR. Then what do you do? Tap into VPNs. I read that using encryption and TOR and such actually makes you a priority target. That&#39;s why, in the cases of terrorism I&#39;ve read about, the communication was pretty much in the open. They use WhatsApp and just create new email accounts as needed. They know better than to take steps to hide their communication because they know that&#39;s the best way to be targeted.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>So Tor is useless for anonymous activity?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Useless is probably too strong a word to use, as malicious exit nodes should be part of your threat model even if intelligence agencies aren&#39;t a concern - malware or ads being injected into your traffic can be a problem even if not specifically targeted by anyone. That doesn&#39;t mean that Tor is useless, only that it becomes merely one part of keeping your anonymity online rather than a silver bullet. If you ensure all of your communications are end-to-end encrypted (e.g. by using hidden services), a bad exit node isn&#39;t enough to reveal your identity - it raises the bar to requiring active attacks on either you or the server, which is probably enough for most people (most people aren&#39;t going to be specifically targeted, and active attacks are easier to detect and take the appropriate action).</p>

<p>Secondly, and more importantly, if using an exit node to reach the &quot;public&quot; (for lack of a better word) Internet, NEVER do anything that connects back to your real identity. Sharing accounts between Tor and non-Tor usage is an obvious risk (even if the site uses SSL, there&#39;s a non-zero chance it leaks enough info. inadvertently to reveal the account name), but more subtle clues, such as looking at opening times for nearby stores, or even using distinctive writing styles or phrases, may also enable you to be identified by a determined adversary. If you take those precautions, the main risk in using Tor in from traffic correlation attacks, which have relatively limited success in identifying users.</p>

<p>At the very least, Tor is an improvement over just using the web in the clear, and unless you doing anything that would attract attention (e.g. frequently visiting known terrorist-involved websites, or organising some sort of smuggling operating), the level of anonymity it provides is still useful (providing you know the risks and take the precautions necessary to reach your desire level of anonymity).</p>

<p>N.B. - For Tor vs. VPN as anonymity tool, I treat Tor as more useful as it is a known quantity. It&#39;s deficiencies (compromised exit nodes etc.) are likely more problematic than an ideal VPN, but I know, more or less, what they are and can account for them if necessary. Setting up a VPN that doesn&#39;t leave a paper trail back to you (either by payments to a provider, or by hosting your own server somewhere) is non-trivial, and likely requires some degree of trust in the VPN provider (e.g. are they <em>really</em> not keeping logs?; are they a intelligence agency/criminal organisation front company?; the company may be secure and trustworthy but I think it&#39;s all but a given that <em>their</em> outgoing Internet links will be tapped and analysed). For avoiding the more public forms of surveillance (such as ISPs being forced to keep logs), they are a useful tool, but, as with Tor, are not a silver bullet. </p>

<p>Maybe that&#39;s why they are exposing the CIA MK program  with this mass shooting? Bc they know the CIA overthrew Julian Assange. And CIA has too much power and needs to be taken down?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh yeah I saw that!! 
So, Julian was an asset of the Australian CIA. What if he was able to break through his MK and started leaking damaging emails? 
I remember reading somewhere Julian always ran a couple microwaves in the Embassy to stop the electromagnet waves from outside to researching inside. 
I tired to find the article but I can&#39;t find it :/
Do you think he&#39;s back under MK after possibly being captured by the CIA?  </p>

<p>Camp King was strategically located in the village of Oberursel, eleven miles northwest of the United States European Command (EUCOM) headquarters in Frankfurt. Officially the facility had three names: the U.S. Military Intelligence Service Center at Oberursel, the 7707th European Command Intelligence Center, and Camp King. In 1945, the place housed captured Nazis but by 1948 most of its prisoners were Soviet bloc spies. For more than a decade Camp King would function as a Cold War black site long before black sites were known as such—an ideal facility to develop enhanced interrogation techniques in part because it was “off-site” but mainly because of its access to Soviet prisoners.&quot;</p>

<p>Wow. I knew Alex Constantine would have an interesting piece just as I knew you would. Still working my way through the links but your theories on ways to distinguish schizophrenics from people exposed to DEW is interesting. </p>

<p>Thanks for your interest in biochemistry. I researched the biochemistry of schizophrenics and people who have paranoia and compared the histamine level of people with radio wave sickness. I don&#39;t have the time to summarize the papers on brain EEG, neurotransmitters, biopterin, minerals and vitamins of radio wave sickness and compare them with the levels in schizophrenia. The papers are in the wiki index of <a href="/r/electromagnetics">/r/electromagnetics</a>. Any people interested in conducting research?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Because this attack is all about israel/ jewish americans, and DWS is nominally representative of jews in the DNC (first jewish congresswoman in florida).  Ft Lauderdale is one of the most jewish places on the planet.  This attack is re-enforcing the ageless concept of jewishness that the jews are constantly under attack by forces (whether islamic or christian or religion in general, or state oriented, or ideologically oriented) seeking to murder all the jews.  Their victimhood and need to struggle together and persevere over their enemies is represented by every aspect of both the secularist culture and religion (this philosophy can be both positive or negative depending on how it&#39;s applied, but it unfortunately often applied to manipulate the jewish people and supporters of israel by appealing to a general sense of neurosis and personal/ ethnic victimhood).  This is how they keep jewish people pliable and demanding more security/ gun control/ &quot;defense&quot;.  Everything about it is reactive.  Every tragedy gets a visceral reaction- &quot;they need to do more to keep us safe from those who seek to harm us&quot;.</p>

<p>So dws is representative of the clinton wing of the dnc.  she was perfectly placed.  she&#39;s the victim of the russians (much like jews consider themselves the victims of the russians/ soviet union) and is lending her support while re-enforcing her own need from the support of her people.</p>

If u want to learn about it... just search around on YouTube. You will be amazed with all you learn.

    <div class="md"><p>Also lemme tell you quote unquote people with bipolar are some of the most intuitive, loving, creative people as long as fear and delusion is transformed into something creative.  I believe bipolar is similar to how we actually are.  Undeniable powerful confident, unstoppable force.  They use their energy and drain it then they hit the low to recharge.  Our society likes labels and they are traps that ensnare your consciousness to only see thru the peephole.  But holy fuck our brain isn&#39;t processing the whole picture on default it is a information filtering machine.  But like a damned radio you can change what your attune with.  I prefer the sound of the universe the music of the spheres of you will 432hz is.  Also everything is alive and has a consciousness your fucking turd you just dropped is alive that toliet paper to wipe your ass is alive.  Consciousness cannot be destroyed on changed/transformed.  Wake the fuck up and see the reality for what it. Is.  A canvas that we are all painting on.  We are creators and the destroyers and it is fucking beautiful. Take your power back and be the witch you have always been.  Only you know the answers outside sources like me are retarded when it comes to practicality for your life.  This is mostly and exercise to get my consciousness warned up for that day and if the byproduct of that is a slightly tip in the scales then it is a collective win.  You are a fucking god we all are.  DO YOU UNDERSTAND ME, YOU DONT STAND ABOVE OR BELOW ME.  Thank you for your time as this was most beneficial for myself. Also signing off here with my philosophy and that is be SELFISH thru SELFLESSNESS meaning you gain more when working/helping/ giving your self to something.  Use alchemy gain and lose stuff constantly, barter with the universe and never never sell you self short or to something not serving for you.  For if you ascribe to angels then you see they are your servants and guardians just open a dialog with them.    Peace you cheery cunts </p>

<p>He actually caught an ex FBI agent who ran a huge electromagnet weapon operation in Fort Worth/Dallas. He went on the news with all this info and tried took them to court.

<p>During my research I came across a lot of different types of mind control Weapons. It seems like those are the main type of weapons most countries are into these days.

    <div class="md"><p>The thing is, though, that if anyone right now had the ability to &quot;project images into a person&#39;s brain&quot; they&#39;d be so, so far in advance of the present state of neuroscience that, well, I&#39;d feel pretty demoralized if I were a neuroscientist.</p>

<p>There&#39;s a MASSIVE difference between stimulating the skull to vibrate or subjecting one&#39;s auditory nerves to an electrical signal to produce the sensation of hearing something to actually decoding the stream of consciousness or the visual cortex or whatever to inject imagery.</p>

<p>I feel like Science™ and its popularizers try to sell the idea that we&#39;re up to that stage already, but we&#39;re not. Not by a long, long, long shot. Uninformed people will just believe it. &quot;Scientists can now read your thoughts with a computer!&quot; – most would believe it, but it&#39;s total rubbish.</p>

<p>The best I&#39;ve seen is that experiment where subjects were shown various images, their electrical brain patterns recorded, and then, using that information, they were able to predict with some accuracy which picture they were looking at (or perhaps thinking about) by statistically matching brain patterns to those already observed.</p>

<p>That&#39;s clever, but it says nothing about how the brain encodes, well, anything. It&#39;s just a bit more sophisticated than looking at someone flushing red and predicting that they&#39;re experiencing embarrassment.</p>

<p>The brain is not &quot;like a computer without a firewall&quot; – it&#39;s a multi-dimensional, massively parallel quantum computer designed (in a way) by a process that is perfectly cognizant of every last detail about how this reality functions.</p>

<p>Just look at the world around you. That&#39;s not the world, actually, it&#39;s a concept inside your head. However, what you see isn&#39;t like a painting – or two paintings – it&#39;s a fully articulated, high resolution 3D raytraced virtual reality. Mostly, it&#39;s self rendered – one only need glance briefly at a tree to see it in its totality. That&#39;s because your brain <em>knows the fractal mathematics underlying life on earth</em> It only needs a little information and generates the rest procedurally.</p>

<p>How all this works is completely unknown to current science, and I really doubt covert interests have much more of an idea.</p>

<p>IMO, all this is just to scare people into behaving. Like Santa Claus.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The things about listening to spirits is they are deceptive and most likely false.  They manipulate and do their bidding in delusion and fear.  Your true inner voice is thee only thing to listen to.  Find it listen and heal yourself.  You have a purpose and don&#39;t let anyone tell you otherwise.  If you don&#39;t do what your soul wants then enjoy the endless cycle.   A lot of religion has taken our power away but we are all manifestations of God consciousness in the physical.  We have to bear pain because pain and beauty are one and the same.  I thank you because your body is in severe pain mentally/physically and once you recognize it your body will prioritize the pain and allow itself to heal.  Don&#39;t let anyone tell you other wise.  We are fucking gods. We are the source experiencing itself.  Fuck labels and duck this sick society most of have been molded by.  Hug your mom, forgive cause t frees you not the other person, fuck something, love something.  You&#39;re not gonna change the world by trying to. You must change it by changing your own reality and that will manifest into the whole collective than you&#39;ll ever realize.  Fear is a weak emotion but is the best fuel in the world. Fuck your sentence structure cause consciousness stream is the only way to blow off steam.</p>

If you have ever heard his brother Dennis talk about it I get the vibe that he felt that not disclosing his shroom fears was necessary to continue his public persona as a PR rep for the mushroom. I don&#39;t really think it discounts any of his ideas beyond proving that no matter how experienced you are with psychs it&#39;s always possible to spiral out.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, it&#39;s good advice, even if he did get discouraged at some point. I never expected that the psilocybin experience would be so &#39;open ended&#39; – i.e., that the more you take, the further and further out you get.</p>

<p>Since I started doing 5+ grams of shrooms (up to 7g at present, but need to grow my own before going higher on account of price) I&#39;m of the opinion that psilocybin is just The Best. Not really sure why people get so excited about ayahuasca – shrooms is a much more hmmm <em>relevant</em> experience IMO.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not saying that technological advances are never kept hidden, but c&#39;mon, this was apparently made in 1985. The best thing they&#39;d be able to project would be pacman. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not just on CIA mind control. Subscribers of <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> and I have asked you to cite sources when you threadjacked by bringing up other topics.</p>

<p>Why should subscribers of <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> believe everything you say? Why make them beg for a source? You need to cite sources when you initially make claims.</p>

<p>You have made numerous exaggerations this week in <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>:</p>

<p><a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/5mgpi1/fll_gunman_tried_to_turn_himself_to_the_fbi_told/dc56ny1/">https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/5mgpi1/fll_gunman_tried_to_turn_himself_to_the_fbi_told/dc56ny1/</a></p>

<p>I am still waiting for you to cite sources. You bully and derail. Therefore, I  created a post for you to cite sources for three claims out of over a dozen claims you made this week in <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>. Cite sources or retract your claims:</p>

<p><a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/TargetedEnergyWeapons/comments/5mvsew/rebuttals_assassination_barrie_trower_says_the/">https://np.reddit.com/r/TargetedEnergyWeapons/comments/5mvsew/rebuttals_assassination_barrie_trower_says_the/</a></p>

<p>Majority of your sources are fake in that they do not substantiate your claims. For example,</p>

<p><a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/TargetedEnergyWeapons/comments/5n7y3t/definition_of_a_ti/">https://np.reddit.com/r/TargetedEnergyWeapons/comments/5n7y3t/definition_of_a_ti/</a></p>

<p>As my  mod, it is essential that you accurately describe targeted individual issues. I am giving you three days to cite sources that actually substantiate your claims or retract your claims. Otherwise, I will demod you.</p>

<p>So why did Lieutenant Colonel Timothy L. Thomas write this:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The Mind Has No Firewall</p>

<p>The human body, much like a computer, contains myriad data processors. They include, but are not limited to, the chemical-electrical activity of the brain, heart, and peripheral nervous system, the signals sent from the cortex region of the brain to other parts of our body, the tiny hair cells in the inner ear that process auditory signals, and the light-sensitive retina and cornea of the eye that process visual activity.[2] We are on the threshold of an era in which these data processors of the human body may be manipulated or debilitated. Examples of unplanned attacks on the body&#39;s data-processing capability are well-documented. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>To me, it really seems that in order to be able to project images into a person&#39;s mind, one would have to understand the nature not just of thought, but consciousness itself. There&#39;s no &quot;screen&quot; in your brain that you &quot;watch&quot;. We&#39;re not looking at an image but an idea. Influencing that would necessitate a comprehensive understanding of all processes, at a fundamental level, that operate in the brain; i.e., a perfect understanding of not just material physics, but everything else about this reality. Anyone with that knowledge would be unassailably powerful. Why not just project images into everyone&#39;s minds so they just do whatever you want them to. What would be the point of playing politics if you can simply induce mass hallucinations at the flick of a switch?</p>

<p>While it&#39;s not impossible, do you really think that every neuroscientist, every computer scientist or AI researcher, every physicist, etc. etc. is working in vain? Did you know that neuroscience, at present, is arguing about how a network of less than 10 neurones interoperates, and as yet haven&#39;t achieved a great deal of insight into it? I&#39;d consider making a bet that even in 50 years, this will remain science fiction.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well okay but this argument begs the question. You&#39;ve stated the conclusion in the opening sentence. </p>

<p>You then go on to inductively argue that it seems so unlikely.</p>

<p>In the 1950s this argument was used to prove that the Mafia couldn&#39;t possibly exist because everyone knows that criminals aren&#39;t intelligent enough to organise themselves. Now this belief isn&#39;t just naive because, well the Mafia do exist, it&#39;s naive by several magnitudes in that not only does organised crime exist, it is prevalent in banking, in politics, in business etc. </p>

<p>The mistake comes from the inappropriate use of occam&#39;s razor. When all of the factors are known, it can be a powerful tool. When we have gaps in our knowledge it appeals to inductive fallacy (common sense fallacy). This is the very reason magicians are able to fool us.</p>

<p>The bottom line is that you can&#39;t avoid doing some hard grunt work to attempt to answer the question. You have to consider witness testimony, which apparently is too challenging for us. We apparently have to brush all testimony as lies, even if stands up in court of law.</p>

<p>And more concretely, we do have tons and tons of data on classified project and black projects. We know for a fact what they were studying and it goes beyond MKULTRA. We know that projects go dark when they are being integrated into the private sector. We understand enough about the process to make the statement that the government posesses advanced technology. And yeah sorry to all the scientists&#39; life work and stuff but inductive arguments are a waste of time.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Damn right I can! I really think the eastern front missed out on the WWII craze that Saving Private Ryan and Band of Brothers started, but then again it would be unseemly to portray the ruskies in a heroic light.</p>

<p>But yeah, I found this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0A6UWkK2U4s&amp;amp;list=PLnNmfyY_ccRHl0yAJZy3r5Nfq2-Xr22di">18 part (I think?) documentary</a> on the eastern front that was made for Russian audiences but has been dubbed over in english by the BBC (the maps are still in Russian so it&#39;s kind of a fun geography test). </p>

<p>I first became aware of the whole eastern front history from Dan Carlin&#39;s 4 podcast episodes called <a href="http://www.dancarlin.com/product/hardcore-history-ghosts-ostfront-series/">Ghosts of the Ostfront</a> which is super easy to listen to. It costs money but it&#39;s pretty cheap and I&#39;m sure you can pirate it somewhere. </p>

<p>The thing that is striking to me is that as an american who grew up during the WWII pop culture bubble I really thought that D-Day was by far the most action that happened in the war (as a sea invasion it technically was) but when you start hearing that the civilians under siege up in Leningrad resorted to cannibalism and that the Russians were surprise invaded and managed to completely move their manufacturing industry to Siberia it gives you a taste of nationalistic pride for a country which is certainly no good these days haha. </p>

<p>You seem to suggest a scenario in which he WAS mentally ill and also an MKULTRA victim, which kind of wipes the Just mentally ill option from the board while recognizing it&#39;s validity in a larger narrative. </p>

<p>Psychotic breaks from reality, when they occur in the early stages of paranoid schizophrenia, are just that, breaks, as in temporary. My buddy experienced this, was hospitalized for a few days, got fluids, evaluation, and came out of his psychosis rather quickly. While pretty goddamn shaken, he was back to his usual self for the most part, until the next break occurred. A few days of rehydration and sleep maybe put Santiago back to some semblance of rationality, he stopped talking about the government forcing him to view murder videos, and was released and re-armed, as per law. </p>

<p>This isn&#39;t a time to worry about guns. What are they going to do, honestly. They will have drones with surface-to-air missiles. What we need is to come together and awaken the masses to what is going on behind the scenes.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think most people who know about MKULTRA in the past believe that it is real and likely still ongoing, but that doesn&#39;t mean that every disaster labeled Possible MKULTRA is in fact an instance of this. With this case, there&#39;s basically no way to prove whether or not Santiago was sane before this shooting-- he checked into psych watch under his own volition and was never charged with a psych-related crime (aside from previous domestic abuse cases), and was never medicated. I would like to hear from those who evaluated him then and those soon to do the same. </p>

<p>Consider this scenario: the idea of an ISIS Delusion Disorder is proposed and promoted, focusing on the internal mechanisms that occur in someone who views and is intrigued for whatever reason by ISIS propaganda, how they either buy in fully without question or look for/invent reasons why they are so intrigued (the government is making me do it). If this school of thought was established in examining ISIS-inspired attacks and the general way in which a consciousness processes violent propaganda and directed snuff films, would you consider this some sort of MKULTRA spillover into academia and psychological research?  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I definitely see the ethics-violation angle, but I don&#39;t think there&#39;s anything too religious in the draw of watching ISIS&#39;s actual propaganda videos-- they&#39;re just well-produced snuff videos with some bizarre shouting about Allah thrown in.

    <div class="md"><p>His legs were whipped and he had a bullwhip inserted in his anus. It&#39;s rape. He was obviously scared/shocked. No body cares because people hate modern art and think such artists deserve worse.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>One woman who came with her boyfriend, who was outside the door when this happened, whipped my legs for ten minutes and then stripped my clothing and proceeded to rape me… There were hundreds of people in line when she walked out with disheveled hair and smudged lipstick. It was no good, not just for me but her man as well. On top of that my girl was in line to see me, because it was Valentine’s Day and I was living in the gallery for the duration of the event – we were separated for five days, no communication. So it really hurt her as well, as I guess the news of it travelled through the line. When she came in she asked for an explanation, and I couldn’t speak, so we both sat with this unexplained trauma silently. It was painful</p>

    <div class="md"><p>lol did I ever say I experience that?</p>

<p>Please do some research on MK ULTRA.</p>

<p>Do some research on Psychiatrists who use trauma to split personalities.</p>

<p>These same Psychiatrists are the ones who write the definitions.</p>

<p>There is no blood test to determine if someone is schizophrenic. They are trained by textbooks and if something you say is similar to the criteria in the DSM manual, you are mentally ill.</p>

<p>For example, claimed he was stalked by the FBI. The psychiatrists said he was paranoid. He later killed himself (probably programmed too via electroshock &quot;therapy&quot;)</p>

<p>Decades later, FBI revealed that they had stalked him.</p>

<p>He was never crazy, just victim of a corrupt system. His friends must feel like shit, knowing they helped kill him, because they couldn&#39;t think for themselves and just went along with whatever the Government said. Sheeple.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s a spook saying they can create symptoms using technology indistinguishable from schizophrenia:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLWRdkxKXiw">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLWRdkxKXiw</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>I mean voices are the easiest ones (to create) because all you have to do is stimulate the cochlea with a set frequency.  It’s very easy.  Voices are very easy.  And it isn’t that people are imagining voices.  They physically hear them.  They physically hear as I’m talking to you.  My voice isn’t inside your brain.  My voice goes no further than an inch into your ear.  It’s the electrical signal that makes you interpret how I sound and once you’ve got this electrical signal which can be a chip or lots of things you can physically make people hear voices.   It can cause insanity and it was an experiment to take an ordinary sane person, cause insanity and have a psychiatrist, who was unknown to everybody, diagnose schizophrenia or paranoia or a psychiatric illness.  That was a successful outcome and the person would spend the rest of their life in an asylum and in misery but to the government scientists that was a success.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>PS. hearing voices that use grammatically correct sentences and issue instruction and do follow up is not a &quot;mild variant of paranoid schizophrenia&quot; lol even if someone just hears knocking noises which aren&#39;t real they are schizphrenic according to DSM manuals. You&#39;re ignorant of your own bullshit lol</p>

In fact many Guantanamo Bary prisoners complain of voices in their heads and are diagnosed as &quot;sluggish schizophrenics&quot;, whatever that is.</p>

<p><em>Yes.</em> Because &#39;functional&#39; human brains often think in grammatically correct sentences. If you can think it, an ill brain can think it for you. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s impossible for a malfunctioning computer to output sentences that are grammatically correct, let alone issue instructions and follow up on how accurately they are followed. Same with the human brain.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t understand how you could believe something so preposterous. Oh wait, I know why, because you saw it on &quot;a beautiful mind&quot;?</p>

<p>The &quot;fake diagnosis&quot; is schizophrenia, full sentences or not. The real cause, if full sentences, CIA mind control. </p>

<p>It gets even funnier. The CIA for some reason near this army base didn&#39;t even bother trying to hide the pattern of mind control. They torture homosexuals using their v2k weapons in the same way. All of them tortured by a voice that introduces itself as sally. What is the probability that all of these people would have the same brain malfunction???</p>

<p>But anyway they just get a psychiatrist (gay one too, so the tv news audience thinks &quot;gee he must&#39;ve looked at it from all sides, cos he&#39;s gay like them, i&#39;m sure he left no stone unturned&quot;) to say they&#39;re all schizo suffering from a group delusion.</p>

<p>The Mind Has No Firewall</p>

<p>The human body, much like a computer, contains myriad data processors. They include, but are not limited to, the chemical-electrical activity of the brain, heart, and peripheral nervous system, the signals sent from the cortex region of the brain to other parts of our body, the tiny hair cells in the inner ear that process auditory signals, and the light-sensitive retina and cornea of the eye that process visual activity.[2] We are on the threshold of an era in which these data processors of the human body may be manipulated or debilitated. Examples of unplanned attacks on the body&#39;s data-processing capability are well-documented.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Okay here&#39;s my theory. Maybe he was downloading all this propaganda and was enjoying CP and the FBI or CIA caught wind of one or the other and said hey since we know your have CP and we know you are watching the propaganda, which the CIA made, so he was already exposed to easy manipulation.
  So they maybe talked to him, took him some where, or maybe fed him certain types of propaganda to subconsciously imprint something in his mind. This way they could trigger him.</p>

<p>Now idk how.this all works so here is another theory. 
Maybe certain types of images make the brain relax its mental walls or some type of field, plus any medication could add to this and a myriad of other things. Maybe they use a MK Ultra psychics or they have some kind of technology that control brainwaves or maybe he has a chip in him. They the could remotely access people or at least take control of their thought process to make them do things. Put their personality aside and take control of their consciousness or some crazy shit who knows. I&#39;m just putting crazy things out there. We live in probability universe so anything is possible.</p>

Do you realize more of our soldiers have died from suicide than from actual combat, that for everyone of our   soldiers that died more than 200 &#39;&#39;enemies/civilians&#39;&#39; died? We shouldn&#39;t be over there in the first place, but do you know how long it took to take out saddam? 3 weeks, to go to the other side of the planet and blow up a country.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t agree with the war, or how much we spend on the military, or a lot of things this country does. I fully support the second amendment and enjoy shooting and hunting.

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t think obama was going to outlaw guns but he was put in place to bring it one step closer to gun control. The NWO puppets are put in place to bring them closer to harsher gun laws. The NWO was counting on Hillary winning and would of gave her orders to carry out false flags bringing America one step closer to gun control. They are very patient ppl and plan stuff like this decades ahead of time. 
That&#39;s why obama is so pissed Trump won bc the elites who own him might not agree with the &quot;gun control&quot;. So, trump will bring the NWO 10 steps back, which means Obamas efforts during those 8 years can be wiped out. 
U see where I&#39;m coming from? They NWO elite know Americans don&#39;t want a NWO and can&#39;t put it in place with all of us armed. they have to strip our gun rights small pieces at a time so we don&#39;t notice what they are actually doing. 
I.e. Say for the next 20 years the NWO succeeded in electing their puppets. All of the puppets are for gun control. 
One puppet organizes false flags with mental illness shooters. Eventually the mass population will say take gun rights away from mental illness ppl bc that aren&#39;t in their right mind. So a law is put in place <a href="http://www.mrconservative.com/2014/01/31501-obamas-gun-confiscation-begins/">and healthcare providers are forced to hand over any mental illness records to govt </a> 
That&#39;s a HUGE group that will be disarmed. 1 out of 4 ppl in America take some type of anxiety or depression pill. </p>

<p>Next puppet works on disarming the military with pstd. The puppet reforms the military benefits (like trump wants to do) and majority of the vets apply for the benefits saying they have pstd. Then false flags are organized with military men who have pstd. Over time the mass population will force gun control on that group. That&#39;s another large group disarm and this time its the group that is TRAINED to protect us. </p>

<p>You see where I&#39;m going? They start with 100% ppl armed to 30% armed. 30% is a better number for them if they want to force NWO on us. </p>

The elites that are involved are obama Bushes Clinton&#39;s pope queen Merkel... basically all the country&#39;s that are ran by the central banks, which is owned by the Rothschild. The only countries that ARENT under the central banks control is Russia, china, Iran and Cuba, which are our enemeys bc US is owned by the central banks. 
YouTube new world order documentary and get familiar with it bc that&#39;s what our world is fighting against right now. Once the NWO is ushered in we are slaves to the elites and a lot of ppl say that&#39;s when the antichrist will rise to the thrown. 
There&#39;s a few things that need to happen first before the NWO can be put in place.. ww3, and economic collapse of the US dollar and the third temple needs to be built in Israel. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Replace radio with illuminati bc the radio is ran by the illuminati. 
Jay z and Beyoncé are the stop of the illuminati pyramid for the music industry. They are what you call the king and Queen of the music industry for the illuminati. He mentioned &quot;jayz talk to me, just call me, I know you got killers and don&#39;t put them at my head&quot; he&#39;s wanting jays to talk to him person to person and not as the illuminati music king who has access to hitmen (star whacking)<br/>
He says radio (illuminati)  lies to you, fb lies to you, Google lies to you... which means they are all controlled by the higher power elites. 
He said he was his Trump shit... this is almost immediately after the election and trump won AGAINST THE ILLUMANTi (establishment) this gave Kanye hope which is why he went out and ranted against the establishment. 
Kanye said something like the new powers are here and the old power structure is dying so don&#39;t get HILLARY clinton. Basically saying ppl are waking up to the old power structure which is why Hillary clinton failed. 
Kid cuddi was once controlled by the illuminati but now speaks out against the illuminati. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t think the people doing the mind control are a homogenous group. I think sometimes they do it to set up the other bad guys.

    <div class="md"><p>Thank you. This to me sounds like the only rational response. So many people here saying &quot;duh, you&#39;ve been duped! Trump&#39;s a billionaire!&quot; As if there was any alternative. (And as if billionaire itself is any proof of anything). At the very least trump has rattled some feathers. This will go a long way to making the masses wake up from their &#39;government loves you&#39; slumber.</p>

<p>hahaha eloquent and directive voices do you honestly believe that it could be anything other than the CIA issuing instructions using their neuro weapons. Do you honestly believe a brain malfunction would output grammatically correct sentences and not just noise?</p>

<p><em>Yes.</em> Because &#39;functional&#39; human brains often think in grammatically correct sentences. If you can think it, an ill brain can think it for you. </p>

<p>There was another option who the powers that be would not allow us access to. His name is Bernie Sanders. He would have beaten Trump. He would have dramatically changed our society. They would have assassinated him. The people might have woken up at that point. Then again ...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t think obama was going to outlaw guns but he was put in place to bring it one step closer to gun control. The NWO puppets are put in place to bring them closer to harsher gun laws. The NWO was counting on Hillary winning and would of gave her orders to carry out false flags bringing America one step closer to gun control. They are very patient ppl and plan stuff like this decades ahead of time. 
That&#39;s why obama is so pissed Trump won bc the elites who own him might not agree with the &quot;gun control&quot;. So, trump will bring the NWO 10 steps back, which means Obamas efforts during those 8 years can be wiped out. 
U see where I&#39;m coming from? They NWO elite know Americans don&#39;t want a NWO and can&#39;t put it in place with all of us armed. they have to strip our gun rights small pieces at a time so we don&#39;t notice what they are actually doing. 
I.e. Say for the next 20 years the NWO succeeded in electing their puppets. All of the puppets are for gun control. 
One puppet organizes false flags with mental illness shooters. Eventually the mass population will say take gun rights away from mental illness ppl bc that aren&#39;t in their right mind. So a law is put in place <a href="http://www.mrconservative.com/2014/01/31501-obamas-gun-confiscation-begins/">and healthcare providers are forced to hand over any mental illness records to govt </a> 
That&#39;s a HUGE group that will be disarmed. 1 out of 4 ppl in America take some type of anxiety or depression pill. </p>

<p>Next puppet works on disarming the military with pstd. The puppet reforms the military benefits (like trump wants to do) and majority of the vets apply for the benefits saying they have pstd. Then false flags are organized with military men who have pstd. Over time the mass population will force gun control on that group. That&#39;s another large group disarm and this time its the group that is TRAINED to protect us. </p>

<p>You see where I&#39;m going? They start with 100% ppl armed to 30% armed. 30% is a better number for them if they want to force NWO on us. </p>

<p>It&#39;s like when there was the shutdown, there was a increase in no of events of TIs killing themselves, attacking others etc. to put pressure to restore funding. Like a woman transcriber who &quot;God&quot; instructed to go on a rant about the Founding Fathers being Freemasons during congress. The media censored the Freemason thing. I was like &quot;oh wow is the CIA mad with the Freemasons? don&#39;t they have enough drug money stashed?&quot;</p>
