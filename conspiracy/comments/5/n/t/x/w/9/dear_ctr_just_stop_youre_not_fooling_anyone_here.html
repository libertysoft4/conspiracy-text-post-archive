<p>200 anti Trump posts on here in 2 days from a month old account</p>

<p>a post on The Donald that didnt even get any traction (1 comment), letting them know that CTR was active again. Something that would be of interest to that sub. From a user thats been here for over 4 years.</p>

<p>which is more suspicious? </p>

<p>If I wanted to brigade a thread, I&#39;d link the fucking thread on /pol/. My post was simply to let people know what was going on here, the exact same purpose of this post. </p>

<p>Yes, I&#39;m calling you a shill because you totally got me in argument, not because you&#39;re a blatant fucking shill with a one month old account that has been spamming this place constantly for the past two days. </p>

<p>You keep saying I&#39;m calling you a shill because I ran out of arguments, I just went though my history and I havent had any interaction like that with you whatsoever. The only posts you&#39;ve made to me are ones where you deny the presence of shills on here.</p>

<p>Funnily enough, in both of my threads about recent shills on here, they were hit with a downvote instantly and you were the first comment in both, denying the presence of shills in both. </p>

<p>&quot;Classic shill behavior&quot; is ridiculous, everything is shill behavior to these people. Short account = shill, old account = shill who bought it. I do post a bunch but so does OP, no one is claiming he is exhibiting shill behavior.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ok, I don&#39;t like going through other peoples post history, but looking at yours it seems like you&#39;re posts are a) almost exclusively arguing against theories in an obtuse way (i.e. you&#39;re not posting any new theories or information, just &quot;debunking&quot; arguments that rely on you downplaying the known facts) or b) taking up tons of time arguing against the idea of shills. We know CTR exists. We&#39;ve been to r/politics enough to see how they operate.  You&#39;re not going to convince anyone they don&#39;t and instead you&#39;re giving off a &quot;he doth protest too much&quot; vibe.

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re acting as if <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> has any more credibility than <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a>.</p>

<p>It doesn&#39;t and is just another side of the same coin and is at point worse.  You guys are the best smearing people if they don&#39;t come to the same conclusion as you. &quot;Shill shill shill!&quot; If anyone has a different thought process to you.</p>

<p>I bet you and many others in here will be trending through my post history right now looking for any excuse to call me a shill which just won&#39;t work. I&#39;ll lay it all out right now.</p>

<p>I am vehemently anti-Trump and my post history will tell you that. He&#39;s not what I&#39;d call a decent human being. He has a history of lying, arrogance and manipulation. He&#39;s downright hypocritical and can&#39;t handle the type of criticism he gave Obama when hounding him in public to prove he was even American and not a Muslim invader.</p>

<p>But questioning Trump&#39;s motives, his conflict s of interest, his words that come out his mouth and the actions he does on camera is a big no no in here. He&#39;s able to flat out deny &quot;that&#39;s not what I meant&quot; and get away with it. He can tweet whatever he wants too, zero accountability.</p>

<p>A few mentions of Pizza though and everyone on here is frothing at the mouth to accuse certain people of being a paedophile </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Alright, I actually did read your wall of text--which you assumed you deserved an answer to when you butted into my conversation (which if you will follow worked out nicely w the dude I was talking to). And guess what...you have no argument that&#39;s relevant to anything I was talking about. Unless you&#39;re argument is that r/politics and r/conspiracy are similar because users all have bias? Not going to argue that one, obviously all humans have bias, but r/politics has a history of not only overt censorship by the mods, but suspicious &quot;shill-like&quot; activity by users LITERALLY posting the same talking points over and over. Like copy paste style. With firstname_lastname accounts. That are all like a month old. As far as Trump goes...yeah...I&#39;m not a Trumpkin either. Didn&#39;t vote for him. Don&#39;t like him. Not sure how you want me to respond when you make blanket statements about the way this sub reacts to his lies. So go fuck yourself. </p>

<p>You finally realised that lack of evidence does not equal proof and you realised that you don&#39;t know how to argue because for once, there&#39;s people who disagree with you. An genuine conspiracy theory comes along, but it implicates your team. Integrity out the window.

<p>The fuck you talking about?  The temporary budget that <em>cuts</em> the shit out of Obamas budget?  Every president ever is usually burdened with the last guys last year budget.  You&#39;re pissed that they cut the shit out of Obamas last year budget? Because Trump is not pres yet, and hasn&#39;t signed a budget bill yet.</p>

<p>It&#39;s exactly the opposite.  You&#39;re saying he&#39;s not a fiscal conservative &quot;because you say so.&quot;  The EVIDENCE says otherwise.</p>

<p>?  Wrong.  You posted up leftist links with no logic.  In the very first one, you claim that selling property to someone who <strong>might</strong> have ties to some Kazakh crime, is itself a crime.  That&#39;s unadulterated bullshit.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yea, if they were patient and tried to do it gradually it might actually work.</p>

<p>When a sub goes from what this place was a month ago, and then instantly there are threads that read like <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a> threads, then everyone here is gonna realize whats up.</p>

<p>Its like how <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a> flipped from Bernieland to what it is today immediately with no gradual transition once the Democrat Convention started.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t think CTR wants to run this sub, and keep it looking vibrant an active on a day to day basis. I do think they want a sub where they can use their voting bots to prop up an agenda piece, and not have it stick out too much. The regulars will notice something like that right away, but the people who randomly come across it at the top of r/all won&#39;t give it a second glance.</p>

<p>If you&#39;re on r/all and see the same story from r/news, r/politics AND from those crazy nutjobs in r/conspiracy you&#39;re probably more likely to believe it. </p>

<p>I disagree. They spent most of Wednesday flooding the New queue with posts trying to <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/5ndydu/there_appears_to_be_an_obvious_attempt_to_take/dcavzt5/">discredit the moderators and claim this subreddit was compromised</a>. Luckily, this community was smart enough to spot their <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/5ndydu/there_appears_to_be_an_obvious_attempt_to_take/">attempted takeover</a> and didn&#39;t fall for it. CTR has backed off on the takeover attempt since then.</p>

<p>Remember, <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> is the last major subreddit (over 100k) that remains uncensored. That makes it a prime target for CTR or some other shill team to want to take it over.</p>

However, all of it is relatively surface level stuff. We know that, based on history, the CIA is the enemy and their propaganda MSM is their most powerful weapon. When a man like Trump who seems to be so anti-establishment, threatens to dismantle the CIA and continuously battles the MSM, it&#39;s hard not to at least entertain the idea of him being a true outsider for the people. We don&#39;t know what&#39;s true or what&#39;s going to happen, but it really is <strong>fucking obvious</strong> when shills shift the narrative of a sub, especially this one.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Did you just make up this new definition of an appeal to authority, or did you read it on an authoritative web site written by an expert in the area of logical fallacies?  </p>

<p>If it was a web site, which authority did you consult to determine that the author of the web site is indeed an expert in the area of logical fallacies?  Was that authority an expert in the area of determining who is an expert in the area of logical fallacies?  </p>

<p>Also, which expert in the area of who is experts in the area of who is experts did you consult?  </p>

<p>It&#39;s experts all the way down.  If only there were an axiom we could fall back on, like say &quot;experts can be correct or incorrect.&quot;  That&#39;s a certainly true statement worthy of axiom status, is it not?</p>

<p>Alternately, rather than use authorities to settle our dispute over whether an appeal to an authority in their area of expertise is a logical fallacy, perhaps we can use logic to deduce whether it is so:</p>

<p>Logic is about absolutes like always and never.  Authorities, even experts, are at best likely correct.  &quot;Likely correct&quot; is not an absolute like &quot;always&quot; and &quot;never.&quot;  Therefore, authorities, even experts, are not logical arguments, and thus, are logical fallacies.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>When a doctor tells you that you have an irregular heartbeat, do you accuse him of an appeal to authority? No.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Well, my doctor can provide evidence upon request, so he&#39;s not exactly ending the debate by saying &quot;fuck you and your desire for evidence and logical reasoning, I&#39;m an expert and I say so.&quot;  </p>

<p>It&#39;s completely different to be able to win the debate with your own expert knowledge vs. declaring that someone else could win the debate if only they were here to argue on your behalf.</p>

<p>Also, people do sometimes seek a second opinion, and I can&#39;t imagine that never in all of history has that second opinion resulted in a different diagnosis despite both doctors being experts.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No one is claiming experts are infallible. But you cannot simply outright dismiss any evidence given by an expert as &quot;an appeal to authority.&quot; It&#39;s not a logical fallacy in this case. We are using <em>inductive</em> reasoning here, not <em>deductive</em> reasoning. </p>

<p>The evidence from Steele is one piece of the total. As we all know, the claims have not be substantiated. But none of us can verify the details of the dossier. That&#39;s why we have to use inductive arguments to come as close to the truth as possible. In making these arguments, the expertise and experience of the person compiling the claims is of central importance. It is <strong>not</strong> a logical fallacy.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I completely disagree that we should take the dossier seriously on the basis of Steele being a former intelligence agent  (though believe, as in all things, we should remain open-minded). </p>

<p>But I do not think you were engaging in a fallacy <em>merely</em> by pointing out Steele&#39;s career. </p>

<p>Almost everything we do here is based upon inductive reasoning. And what are we ever citing in a primarily text-based forum other than claims written by other people? Sure, occasionally a video or photo people can look at themselves (and even then the context/setting of it is usually just a claim written or verbally proffered by someone) It is entirely appropriate to assess the source for credible evidence of expertise in the subject matter upon which they are opining. </p>

<p>I think you slipped in a different way. Yes, we need to be skeptical that he was even involved on the basis of anonymous claims, etc. But even if we stipulate for the purposes of discussion that he is the source, don&#39;t we need to ask another question which is: for what purposes is he gathering this intelligence? Expertise is one major factor, but intent is equally important. In other words, was he even trying to only include true claims?</p>

<p>When an intel agency is gathering intelligence to support a <em>drone strike assassination</em>, they are primarily interested in statements and intelligence that have a high likelihood of being actually <em>true</em>. </p>

<p>When they are gathering claims for the purposes of <em>character assassination</em>, their goals can be completely different. In those situations, it <em>doesn&#39;t matter whether the claims are true</em>, it only matters whether they are likely to be <em>accepted</em> by the target demographic, and severely damaging, false statements that are likely to be accepted are probably given greater weight than less sensational, true claims that aren&#39;t likely to &quot;stick&quot;. </p>

<p>At least one of the very few details in the document that <em>can</em> be verified or falsified has already been proven 100% false. </p>

<p>So if we hypothetically accept that this Steele guy was hired to find <em>damaging</em> information, and we know that for the few damaging claims that are verifiable/falsifiable the score is thus far: &quot;0 damaging claims confirmed / 1 proven to be utterly fabricated&quot;, why the fuck would we care that the guy happened to be trained to gather intelligence?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I mostly agree with you. But I was responding to the insufferable guy who was trying to shut down any conversation by screaming &quot;appeal to authority!&quot; at any sign of dissent. That specific logical fallacy has a specific meaning that is often misused. </p>

<p>There are many ways that you can question the information that Steele has presented. This includes examining his motives, his methods of gathering the information, the actual details in the dossier(some of which you just did). I agree. But that&#39;s far different from dismissing them outright just because he&#39;s an &quot;authority&quot; as the previous(now banned) poster was trying to do. </p>

<p>Looking at his picks, I won&#39;t be surprised if and when he turns out to never have been anti-establishment in the first place, and the plan was to get him into office to speed up the destruction of America by it&#39;s own internal conflict all along. He&#39;s not even president yet and already the country is violently split on the issue with neither side willing to listen to the other and both condemning the other side&#39;s choices.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>And that&#39;s his fault? The MSM and the Obama administration have been seeding conflict out of spite since the election. I don&#39;t agree with some of his cabinet picks, but let&#39;s see what they <em>do</em> and then we can criticize them. He&#39;s more anti establishment than the Democratic Party. Obama&#39;s cabinet was chosen by citi group according to race. No qualifications, it&#39;s all public appearance, and Hillarys turned out to be the same, with <em>John fucking Podesta</em> as <em>secretary of state</em>. I&#39;m sorry but I honestly wouldn&#39;t be able to cope in a world where that sick fuck is in a position like that. I&#39;m ok with where we are now, it&#39;s a step in the right direction, and hopefully we will be able to hold trump accountable for what he promised, unlike Obama who was praised for lying off his ass. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Exactly. And if you notice, they&#39;re not outright saying they believe the CIA, but they are focussing on all of this unfounded and unproven Trump corruption. You have to go through the process of calling them out and explaining how the sub should work, then they just say &quot;the elections over hillarys gone&quot;. It is r/politics brigading, and it may be even more CIA activity too.</p>

<p>And just because you don&#39;t agree with the CIA doesn&#39;t mean you have to agree with Trump, even at this point. But, man it is tough to not support him when there is all of this opposition. However, I don&#39;t think anyone on this sub should be saying even remotely positive things about Trump, and instead, focus on the story behind everything that&#39;s happening. The Russia hack should be the absolute last thing we discuss. Second to last would be anti-clinton shit, simply to get all the never trumpers off our backs. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Obviously Trump is no paragon of truth and purity and there are quite a few things I don&#39;t like about him, as you said, it&#39;s hard not to route for him when his enemies are our enemies. As the saying goes, &quot;the enemy of my enemy is my friend&quot; so no matter the gripes I have with Trump, for now he&#39;s the only one in America that has a chance to pry out the secrets and lies. Of course he has his own problems such as the Goldman Sachs cabinet member, but if he can reform the CIA and get Americans to think critically about what the media tells them, he&#39;s an asset. This election cycle has opened the eyes of many to the corruption of the government and media, and I hope the next 4-8 years continues to red pill. Everything about the Russian narrative reeks of coverup, a mass coverup to take everyone&#39;s eyes off of what the real problem which is the DNC and American government itself. The partisan fighting and infighting inside the parties is no good for anyone, we all need to come together and expose the corruption regardless of political beliefs.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Just because you and your downvote brigade pretend that you don&#39;t understand that saying &quot;believe this authority figure with no evidence because they are an authority figure&quot; is an appeal to authority doesn&#39;t actually make it true.</p>

<p>You can brigade all you want, it doesn&#39;t change reality.</p>

<h1>Claiming that &quot;because an authority figure said so, it must be true&quot; IS the literal definition of appeal to authority, no matter how many people you get to downvote and brigade and spam comments pretending otherwise.</h1>

<p>If you were actually literate you might learn basic concepts such as evidence, reading, and critical thought.</p>

<p>Before you go pretending &quot;critical thought&quot; means believing literally anything with the &quot;unverifiable claims&quot; tag on BuzzFeed, nope, that&#39;s not actually what it means. </p>

<p>Reality isn&#39;t dictated by your feelings. Sorry not sorry.</p>

<p>😂</p>

<p>Thanks for the laughs. </p>

<p>I&#39;ve read through your entire little fit with OP. You&#39;re nothing but a troll with no real points. You ridiculing people&#39;s ideas and clear accusations towards you only makes it clearer. The days of ridiculing conspiracy theorists are over. It&#39;s not going to work. If there&#39;s one thing you should learn it&#39;s that. OP and other users state FACTS about you. Yet all you respond with are insults and ridicules. How do you expect anyone to take you seriously? Especially in a community like this one where people spend hours, days, weeks, months of their lives examining and researching the truth of our society.</p>

<p>You&#39;re not going to win. Keep doing what you&#39;re doing though. The more I think about it. The more I see you&#39;re actually strengthening our community through your nonsense and ignorant replies. </p>

<p>It is not paid employees of CTR, it is users attempting to control the narrative</p>

<p>In most subs we can observe some kind of subculture evolve. Memes, jokes, a vocabulary unique to that sub, that makes it  appealing and fun. The memes of T_D, dickbutt and meta on highqualitygifs, that sort of stuff. </p>

<p>No such thing on politics. It&#39;s just upvoting Trump hit pieces and responding with snarky comments, DNC talking points and chagrin. Users with opposing views are impatiently shouted down and their comments downvoted into oblivion. </p>

<p>It just doesn&#39;t feel that organic to me.</p>

<p>I remember 9/11/16, when Hillary passed out and CTR stood down waiting for orders. Suddenly there was a completely different atmosphere on politics. Bernie supporters, centipedes, Stein and Johnson supporters had pretty meaningful and civil conversations. After the election it looked like that atmosphere could return at times, but for the past 2 weeks they&#39;re right back to full on Trump bashing. </p>

<p>Are so many users that cynical, that attracted to chagrin and that motivated to keep the negativity going on and on and on? I don&#39;t think so, people like variation and they like to have fun. Politics is just not completely organic.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So... what? Are they not allowed to contribute to this sub because they post in another sub?</p>

<p>There&#39;s plenty of t_d people who&#39;ve been part of this community for years. Are they supposed to just not post anywhere but in t_d? Do they have to keep their support for Trump entirely within t_d?</p>

<p>Why do people feel the need to constantly say that this sub has somehow been &#39;taken over&#39; or brigaded by Trump supporters/t_d posters? Why is it such a huge problem that there are a lot of conspiracy theorists who also happen to support him?</p>

<p>It&#39;s just so ridiculous to me that so many people bitch about t_d users somehow &quot;leaking&quot; out into the rest of reddit, as if they&#39;re some sort of virus and aren&#39;t allowed to support Trump anywhere else but their own sub.</p>

<p>It&#39;s also super damn weird and disturbing how much shit Trump supporters get for waiting until he&#39;s actually in office before judging whether or not they&#39;ve been &quot;duped&quot;. How do so many people think his supporters are morons or Russian shills for actually waiting until he starts his job, and waiting for actual evidence that he&#39;s a shitty president?</p>

<p>Like.. what the fuck guys? I am 1000x more disturbed by the amount of people on this sub who are <em>actually believing the CIA</em>, as well as the amount of people who actually believed Putin helped Trump win and that the Russians hacked any emails, all because <em>our intelligence agencies said so.</em> </p>

<p>That behavior is so much more bizarre and suspicious than members of a conspiracy forum voting for the candidate that seemed anti-establishment and who had the most potential to actually change things. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I hate to break it to you, but its not a astroturfing by CTR or any other group other than folks who are seeing a legitimate conspiracy in the stuff swirling around the Trump admin.</p>

<p>You can see what I&#39;ve posted on in other forums, and can probably tell that I&#39;m not a shill or an employee of any organization. I used to play with the conspiracy stuff a lot back in the 1980s and 1990s when it was just fun and games, but a lot the stuff that I&#39;m seeing on here and other places feels a lot like a PsyOp by interested 3rd parties (I&#39;m guessing Russia, they&#39;ve been utilitizing the freedom of protest and speech in the US since the 1950s to their advantage). </p>

<p>To me, and you can think what you want the whole Trump-Russia connections are so much more fun than any of the old school conspiracy tropes because there is so much more ancedotal stuff that is flying around it. You don&#39;t have to jump to a lot of conclusions, it just sorta starts coming together when you look at it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You just restored so much faith in me. Thank you for posting this. I was so afraid others weren&#39;t seeing it. I&#39;ve heard people talk about CTR infiltration but I&#39;ve never noticed it happen so quickly like it has in this sub. I honestly believe top Reddit employees are in on it, and giving CTR access to old unused accounts so they can appear legitimate, or something along those lines. It&#39;s the only thing that makes sense at this point </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I usually dislike posts like this making it to the frontpage... but you come at it with some solid observations... Simple and succinct... You are correct... They are idiots to fuck with the most prolific and skeptical internet community I know of... unless they are using us to hone their blades... CTR could be stress testing their bullshit here... forcing us to expose the weaknesses of their talking points so that when they go mainstream with their bullshit it doesn&#39;t have any holes in it. </p>

<p>I&#39;m usually a pretty positive guy, but I can&#39;t help but feel that from time to time I have been beta-testing bullshit for these dirty fuckers. </p>

<p>Second, this is fucking <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>, right?  It&#39;s currently a god damn conspiracy.  I&#39;ve seen flat earth, holographic moon, holographic planes on 9/11, and whatever else here.</p>

<p>Ah but talking about Trump in a negative way is stepping out of line?  A conspiracy that is still on going.</p>

<p>Are you people fucking kidding me?  It&#39;s not about anti-Trump, we already know he&#39;s going to be President.  CTR wouldn&#39;t fucking care anymore, Hillary would never be President, Pence would be.  So why would she be paying for anything?</p>

<p>This sub is supposed to go on conspiracies.  But currently there is a strong thedonald feel where we&#39;re not allowed to talk about the god damn fucking big ass elephant in the room because you are afraid to.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Agreed. I don&#39;t think this sub doesn&#39;t have to be pro-Trump. I understand that. This sub shouldn&#39;t ever be pro-Hillary though for obvious reasons. Even Trump hate is fine (with legit skepticism), although that horse is beaten to death by now IMO. CTR, politics or whatever Hill shills are pretty obvious, usually when they brigade the top posts and all get gilded.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ok truth here.  But the CIA and intelligence communities are your peers, not your enemies.  You are on opposite sides but not any higher or lower.  So that&#39;s the wrong way of speaking.  Secondly the pushing of pizzagate and the pulling of Russian interference in the election aren&#39;t mutually exclusive just because you see less attention to your political view point.  Pizzagate busted out what a month ago?  And has seen less new information.  Trumps ties to Russia have new info that should be read. Unless you are biased you would see where things land on the spectrum of importance.  It proves your bias kiddo.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If Trump wants to turn against his Russian blackmailers I would support him...</p>

<p>But the fact is that tens of millions more Americans oppose Trump than support him. And millions of people who voted for him admit that Russia helped him by hacking Hillary. Even he admits it now...okay..he just quietly stopped denying it..he&#39;s not the kind of person to admit he was wrong.</p>

<p><strong>&quot;HIS NAME SETH RICH!!!!&quot;</strong></p>

<p>And you Russian puppets said that Russia wasn&#39;t responsible (&quot;SETH RICH!&quot;) and now not even Trump himself denies that it was Russia. This fact doesn&#39;t sink in right? <strong>TRUMP SAW THE CLASSIFIED INTELLIGENCE AND NOW ADMITS RUSSIA HACKED HILLARY&#39;S EMAILS AND THUS THEY LEAKED TO WIKILEAKS TO INFLUENCE HIS WIN</strong>* that is an undisputed fact now...but <strong>DOES NOT COMPUTE</strong> for you idiots that refuse to look at the truth objectively.</p>

<p>I absolutely think the CIA killed JFK or covered up a KGB plot or something like that..I&#39;m happy to admit absolutely anything and listen to any idea...but the facts speak here very clearly.</p>

<p>Russia is known to assassinate and blackmail opponents but Trump&#39;s new Secretary of State just said he couldn&#39;t say whether that&#39;s true or not...okay..he doesn&#39;t admit that Putin is KGB....well fucking Putin admits that shit and says &quot;there is no such thing as a former KGB agent&quot;.</p>
