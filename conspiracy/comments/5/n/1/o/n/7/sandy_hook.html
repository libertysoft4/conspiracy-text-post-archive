        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I&#39;m from CT...i&#39;m also one of you guys. Sometimes you get so deep in this kinda stuff that no matter what people say,  you think &quot;that can&#39;t be what really happened.&quot; I saw the post not too long ago about what conspiracies you believe in and a few people brought up sandy hook. As far as false flags go, sure. Maybe it happened for a reason or maybe it was something super sketchy....but it always peaks my interest when I hear someone say no kids died. I know multiple people who are friends with people who lost their kids.....and the people I know aren&#39;t part of a big government coverup...obviously. I&#39;m just looking for articles or website or videos that &quot;prove&quot; that no one died....or just Sandy Hook stuff thats very interesting in general. Just want to see where you guys are coming from.
Thanks!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>its been literally years since it&#39;s happened... iv watched my share of youtube videos and what not... the way people acted was weird. The whole crisis actor thing...thats weird. The neighbor....there are plenty of things that are out of the ordinary. I think its very possible that there was an agenda here.... that i totally believe. I&#39;m just finding it hard to believe that no one died. Just like the marathon bombing....we all know about that. I guess what i&#39;m saying is that I don&#39;t understand how whether kids died changes the storyline or agenda or gun grab or whatever. Whether they died or not, the endgame is still the same, no?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>To me it has never mattered (in the investigative sense) if anyone died. What matters are the innumerable inconsistencies and contradictions in the narratives and final State Police report.</p>

<p>If one admits there are many sketchy aspects then a new investigation is warranted regardless whether one thinks anyone died.</p>

<p>Things like this are very difficult to explain away</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Just food for thought. I found the timing of the first Jack Reacher (JR) movie and Sandy Hook too coincidental. Sandy Hook (SH) occurred Dec 14. JR was released Dec 21.</p>

<p>Opening of movie shows a sniper taking out certain people. Ok, that&#39;s not unique in most of these type of movies. So, no &quot;red flags&quot; go off for me.</p>

<p>Then I watched the whole thing and came back to a bar scene where JR is talking to a girl. Her name is Sandy. In her conversation with JR, she mentions she&#39;s not a &quot;hooker,&quot; and infers JR is &quot;new in town.&quot;</p>

<p>While all these words appear coincidental in light of the Sandy Hook shooting, I still find it suspect of the timing of this type of movie and the school shooting. One things is certain. This movie was being worked on well over a year before Sandy Hook. That dialogue in the scope of this type of movie still makes me wonder if there&#39;s a connection. It&#39;s seems pretty convenient of the timing of all of this.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Misdirection. You&#39;re on it. Look at the dollar bill right under JR&#39;s hand.</p>

<p>Also, something else in JR&#39;s dialogue. Girl sits down after JR comes out of his &quot;dream state.&quot; She says, &quot;I&#39;m Sandy.&quot; JR goes, &quot;So was I. Last week. On a beach.&quot; JR was released Dec 21. &quot;Last week&quot; would have been Dec 14, the date of the SH shootings.</p>
