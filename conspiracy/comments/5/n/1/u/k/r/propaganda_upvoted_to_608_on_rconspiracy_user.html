<p>Here&#39;s the study: <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3491930/pdf/ehp.1104912.pdf">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3491930/pdf/ehp.1104912.pdf</a></p>

<p>See table 1, scroll down a bit, then see table 1 continued. </p>

<p>One study was at 0.8, another one at 1.8, 2, etc, and they compared them to levels at .3, 1, etc. This is as close to the levels in the US that you can get. We have water at 1 ppm, sometimes, 2, rarely up to 4. People with well water can have higher than 4, but let&#39;s just compare it to what we normally see. </p>

<p>You&#39;ll notice that they also looked at areas with like 11 ppm, and this is why the propagandist will get away with it. He&#39;s technically right, but he lied by omission. </p>

<p>I have to ask, why has nobody called him out? This is not the first time I&#39;ve seen people make this exact claim either. It&#39;s always brought up when this study is cited. </p>

Maybe I&#39;m betraying my biases, maybe I&#39;m jumping to conclusions after having one of my (research-backed) beliefs challenged, but it seems a little out of character for r/conspiracy to come to the aid of poor, old, ever-maligned fluoride. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m the &quot;user&quot; in question of this post. I&#39;m studying to become a scientist, check my extensive (yet obviously fake) history to see for yourself. Sorry to be the one to say this but the data do not support the conclusions. Sure, maybe I went off half-cocked <strong>by jumping straight to the discussion section</strong> of the <a href="https://ehp.niehs.nih.gov/1104912/">paper in question</a> to report ~10x from: </p>

<blockquote>
<p>The exposed groups had access to drinking water with fluoride concentrations up to 11.5 mg/L (Wang SX et al. 2007); thus, in many cases concentrations were above the levels recommended (0.7–1.2 mg/L; DHHS) or allowed in public drinking water (4.0 mg/L; U.S. EPA) in the United States (U.S. EPA 2011). </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Instead of summarizing <a href="https://ehp.niehs.nih.gov/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/ehp.1104912.t001.png">this table</a> on a 3 inch phone in 10 minutes. That one&#39;s on me, I&#39;ll admit. </p>

<p>But that still doesn&#39;t support the notion that fluoride is neurotoxic in humans at the doses used in US drinking water. Sorry to highjack your comment, at least it&#39;s not a 747 or anything.</p>

<p>It&#39;s in high doses of processed foods from Wheaties to Coca Cola and Lipton Tea Bags.  My dad drinks 2 gallons of iced tea a data made with those and has had symptoms of toxicity but he won&#39;t believe me.  My understanding is the fluoridated water they irrigate with and pesticides they use tainted the leaves. Organic teas are safer.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Everything is a matter of dose. Too much fluoride, among a plethora of compounds including vitamin A, can be poisonous. Toothpaste contains up to 1500x the amount of fluoride found in drinking water. So if you eat multiple tubes of toothpaste it can be poisonous. That being said, the symptoms you would experience are not symptomatic of a neurotoxin, save maybe a headache. I&#39;m not going to say it&#39;s perfectly safe, but I&#39;m saying the study condemning it as a neurotoxin has not been substantiated. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Please do summarize the table. I&#39;m not a scientist, but almost every row says that the subjects in high-fluoride areas had a lower IQ than those in low-fluoride areas.

I don&#39;t know how neurotoxicity is defined and I understand that other factors come into play when testing &quot;intelligence&quot;, but, to me, that indicates an inverse correlation between fluoride level and mental acuity.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Maybe after work I can discuss why not every study is comparable to fluoridated drinking water. The problem with most of the studies is that they don&#39;t control for other factors. For example, some examined fluorine in well water as a result of naturally occurring fluorine contamination in the ground. But it&#39;s not clear whether there could be other chemicals in the water as well that are affecting the brain. </p>

<p>One of the biggest holes in the studies is that they don&#39;t control for wealth. Wealth plays a much greater role in child iq and could very well explain the observations. In a poor neighborhood, they may have poor water quality. The observed iq differences could be due to wealth, poor teachers, or any number of factors other than fluorine. If somebody could demonstrate an iq difference by giving children fluorine in doses comparable to drinking water, I would personally petition my city to remove it from the water. </p>

</blockquote>

<p>Not a terrible point, but the control group is at the low end of &#39;acceptable&#39; and <em>higher</em> levels that were still within the <em>allowable</em> levels were definitely lower IQ! You can only bend your truth so much.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, what makes you trust that 0.8mg/L is even reasonable? Just because we don&#39;t know (from this study) if 0.8mg/L is worse than 0mg/L, we <em>do</em> know that 3.6mg/L is worse than 0.8mg/L - and 3.6mg/L is still &quot;acceptable&quot; in the US per OP.</p>

<p>It doesn&#39;t take a whole lot to extrapolate that information to come to a conclusion that even a dose of 0.8mg/L may not be worth the risk, <em>especially</em> since there are no non-dental health benefits!!</p>

<p>And that&#39;s just looking at one random study I pulled out of the 26. I&#39;m sure we can find better.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Instead it focuses on they focus on areas with high fluoride groundwater.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, where are you getting <em>that</em>? This study does not mention well water or ground water whatsoever. Fluoride is fluoride.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If we define toxicity of a chemical just by dosage and not its properties, we are being dishonest. Why? Every chemical conceivable has a small enough dosage that won&#39;t cause noticeable health effects. That amount differs from chemical to chemical, so what? Some you can swim in and consume and not be negatively affected. Others would kill you even in mall doses, but not as the dosage approaches a single molecule. </p>

<p>The deception is supported by the notion that some fluoride is beneficial. Lets assume it&#39;s like uranium for a moment, just for a moment damn it. How much uranium is good for you? None. Yet, at small doses, you won&#39;t even notice negative health effects. If we had a deception campaign that said uranium is good for your liver, but only at very small doses, sold by convincing medical authorities, we might swallow it just the same.</p>

<p>If we know fluoride causes detectable health maladies at doses higher than we use, it is a reasonable suspicion that smaller doses could cause problems that we chronically overlook over time like arthritis. So, even though professionals say it&#39;s safe and you can&#39;t link the disease to the chemical, it doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s good for you to be investing it.</p>

<p>To further complicate matters, some chemicals are just fine in certain exposure ranges. They won&#39;t cause you problems, because your body has the means to deal with the chemical. Some chemicals the body does not excrete as well and some it barely does at all. They accumulate in the body over time. Actually, fluoride is exactly this type of chemical. It accumulates in bones and tissue. Only some of it comes out in urine.</p>

<p>The demons hide (in) the details. </p>

<p>The good thing is that all good and reasonable science and common sense shows that fluoridation is dubious, so they mostly resort to namecalling and strawman arguments.

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m being very serious here. </p>

<p>You say you do things based on science, I say that&#39;s a bunch of hullabaloo, you&#39;re basing what you do on probably blogs or videos</p>

<p>Your phone has, at most a 3 watt transmitter at 1400mhz but it couldn&#39;t heat anything if it tried. At its frequency and its wattage, the only thing heating your head with any measurable impact is the phone&#39;s processor waste heat. </p>

<p>Your microwave runs at 2.54ghz at like 1000W oooh scary,  but you ever notice how the case is always metal or plastic on metal and has that screen? It&#39;s basically it&#39;s own Faraday cage. Almost nothing leaks out. </p>

<p>But if you&#39;re worried about brain tissue heating up, why aren&#39;t you worried about fire, lights and the sun itself since the IR they put off directly heats things. So I hope you never leave your faraday cage home and live in the dark. </p>

<p>Further more the sun gives off UVA and UVB and UVB is known to cause cancer due to it residing on the line of ionizing radiation. </p>

<p>That is absolutely not true, as the concentration and location of the heat makes a significant difference in its effects.  Cook one piece of chicken on a pan and another in the microwave and tell me with a straight face that they are exactly the same.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Read that again. Teeth do not require fluoride in any way. From the same study you cited:</p>

<p>&quot;The effects of fluoride on dental enamel are well documented
[Dean and Elvolve, 1937; Fejerskov et al., 1977;
Thylstrup and Fejerskov, 1978]. At about 1 ppm fluoride
(53 ÌM) in the water supply, visible signs of fluorosis
begin to become obvious on the enamel surface as opacities,
implying some porosity in the tissue. As dose
increases, these become more obvious until at 10 ppm
(530 ÌM) or so, the porosity is such that the enamel is
physically compromised and large pieces may be fractured
from the tooth especially after eruption. The porosity
appears to derive from incomplete crystal growth such
that the normal close juxtaposition and interlocking of
crystals does not occur.&quot;</p>

<p>The effect of fluoride on the dentition is dose-dependent

Above certain levels in the water supply, visible changes

<p>That is discussing the effect of high doses of fluorine and how it may compromise tooth integrity at high doses. I do question why 1ppm would begin to show signs of fluorosis, I&#39;ll try to ascertain the reason for the discrepancy later.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Unlike other hive minded subs this one doesn&#39;t follow the normal hive mentality. There is no consensus here, however you will find a lot more open dialog and opposition. </p>

<p>I for one think vaccines are extremely ineffective and dangerous to humanity in the long term, and big pharma has shown time and time again that they CANNOT BE TRUSTED. Why anyone would decide to just blindly trust governments in collusion with the pharmaceutical industrial complex shows just how delusional the masses have become. </p>

<p>Vaccines foster us to keep living these toxic malnourished lifestyles. If we put half the effort into eating right, drinking clean pure water, and living healthy the threat of diseases diminishes rapidly. </p>

<p>Why do many people worship and beg for these vaccines when they have no idea where they come from, what&#39;s in them, what the long term effects are, etc? A lot of people claim they know these answers, but they don&#39;t, and they really can&#39;t claim they do because it&#39;s literally impossible. </p>

<p>I think propaganda on vaccines is so heavy that most people are willing to put 10 times the effort into arguing for vaccination over taking responsibility for their own life and living a healthy lifestyle (which is a far more effective vaccine). </p>

<p>Another interesting observation is that the same pro-choice neo-liberals who argue time and time again for a woman&#39;s choice to kill an infant because &quot;it&#39;s her RIGHT ITS HER body&quot;, want to strip us all of that same right to force their untested, ineffective, and dangerous vaccines on us and our children. </p>

<p>For me the thing that seems off about flouride being added to the water is this. I&#39;m no scientist btw, I&#39;m not even terribly book smart, let&#39;s air that out. Anyway:</p>

<ul>
<li>FDA classifies flouride as a drug</li>
<li>It&#39;s the only drug added to our water</li>
<li>It does not make the water safer, it actually has nothing to do with the water itself</li>
<li>It&#39;s being done against our will and for many people against their knowledge</li>
<li>So you&#39;re taking a drug whether you like it or not - but you can never know the exact dose</li>
<li>Not enough testing has been done on flouride</li>
</ul>

<p>This is the reason I filter all of my drinking water. I have kids who could be possibly negatively affected by this drug. Flouride filters are not cheap. This is some straight up bullshit. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>When you asked him first about dunning-kruger I was like man....I don&#39;t think he is prepared for the conversation that is about to follow lol</p>

<p>Curious if you picked that up from the You are not so smart podcast .   A lot of good gems from there.</p>

<p>It looks like you&#39;ve ran into a few who would criticize you for erring on the side of caution when it comes to things like exposure etc etc.    But good on you - thanks for the interesting read.  Good food for thought</p>
