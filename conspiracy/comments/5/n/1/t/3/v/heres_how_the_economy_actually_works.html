        <p><span class="badge badge-primary">105</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;2017-01-10 by <a class="author" href="../../../../../../../../user/LightBringerFlex.html">LightBringerFlex</a></p>
        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>After months of reading, I&#39;m pretty sure I have a really solid idea of how it works. It&#39;s very different than what they tell you which is the economy is struggling to keep up. Those are all lies. The truth is they want to maintain a perfect struggling level where Americans are barely making it so that they can one day come in and ask for more power to fix the economy. They are ultimately seeking more and more power until they control the whole planet from a centralized location like DC. The reason they are so cold is because they believe that by religion, and by their Khazarian bloodline, all non-Khazarians are goy (sheep for slaughter) and all these goy are here to serve the Khazarians. This is how they think. They don&#39;t care if your White, Black, or Latin. They separated themselves from the goy. They simply see you as a lesser being. </p>

<p>Here are some key points to understanding the economy. </p>

<ol>
<li><p>The economy is not actually difficult to improve drastically. It is sort of on a volume control. It can be raised or lowered at will. All of the depressions/recessions were like false flags. They make this happen by removing money from the economy which is very easy to do. George Soros was planning on raising the stocks really high so that the value of gold drops massively. He will then invest most of his money into gold and then crash the economy so that Gold prices blow up and he quadruples+ his money. Bam, within notime, he has sucked out a lot of money from the economy while offering nothing in return. The word is that he is angry about the Trump win so he wants to punish the goy for electing a populist. This doesn&#39;t mean it will happen. It can be stopped or Soros can change direction for whatever reason.</p></li>
<li><p>The elite hoard all the power, wealth, and technology for themselves but they maintain a little bit in the economy but just barely enough to grease the wheels. They have to do this because they want the economy to go on a multi-decade drag which will harm many, many people psychologically which will then lead to desperation which will then increase the chances of the elite being granted power to fix the problem that they themselves created. It&#39;s a big gimmick. There is actually a perfect amount of loose money to travel through the economy. For example, you don&#39;t want to put 800 trillion in cash into the economy because the value would drop. You also don&#39;t want to only put 1 trillion because then there would be such little money, a lot of people would never see a dime and can revolt. The perfect limit is enough money to barely keep the people going but in a major struggle. All laws are made to accommodate this but in reality, I suspect that if the people were to ever find out that the elite were hoarding insane amounts of wealth, technology, and resources, the people would run in there and kill the with their bare hands. There is so much to go around yet we sit here thinking that the economy is just a constant struggle. Don&#39;t believe these lies. They are all lies. We have much more than just the cure for cancer. We know how to make an economy work... but.... the elite don&#39;t have this in their agenda. </p></li>
<li><p>So basically, you have 2 areas of life. You have the elite who control and continue to hoard all the wealth, technology, and resources into massive vaults across the world and then you have us who basically have no control over anything. We have to hope that they put money into the economy but that won&#39;t work because they don&#39;t want to. They just trigger recessions ever so often to further destabilize the economy to further enhance their opportunities for global power. When we find these hoarded vaults and release them into the world, the price on resources will drop drastically because they are artificially priced right now. The elite basically sell resources like wood at a much higher rate than what its worth by tricking the public into thinking we hold a low supply of wood. This is not true. We actually have giant stashes of resources that would last us many, many ages if we stopped digging for more. This would be a good break on the planet so it can replenish itself. Remember when oil was $5 a gallon? What happened? They just decided to drop it for whatever reason. They have plenty but oil is nothing. They can easily build electric cars but then the power holders that control the oil would lose a lot of power. They would rather pollute the environment and destroy the planet than help the people. All for power. By holding a 500 year supply of any said resource, they are essentially empowering themselves. The more they have, the more the power. This way, they can hold it over your head if you threaten them. Also, they have technology beyond your wildest dreams. This technology would not only make life easier but it would make it more profitable for the people. What they do essentially is release the old technology that was developed 30-50 years ago by selling it or just giving it to giant corporations like Apple who then release stuff like an Ipad. The Ipad technology has been around for decades but it wouldn&#39;t pay off for them to release it decades ago. You have to understand this. They drop the Ipad on us now and the new technology they have will probably drop 50 years from now as new technology is made to replace it. By controlling the technology, they slowly leak it into the public so that they can make every dime they possible can on it. If they were to release the technology all at once, then all the older technology would be worthless as they can&#39;t even sell it at this point. Why would someone want a 1975 computer when they can get a 2017 version? Who needs DOS when you have windows? What they do is they drop DOS into the market, juice it for all its worth, and then drop windows 1.0 and so on. They just leak it into the economy slowly. This way, they get your cash for the technology plus there is a guaranteed flow of income from all the other hoarded technology. They also have much more wealth than they claim they have. The amount of money they have is so immense that they don&#39;t really have to help the world to make it. If Soros ends up buying up the gold and then selling it as the market crashes, he will make tens of billions overnight. Did he earn that money? Nope. He actually destroys the economy to make that money so in essence, he is making money by selling misery to the people and he is making billions. They have always worked like this though. I am hearing rumors that the zero-point energy is already here on the planet. (refer to podesta emails where they mention this). We have 0 point energy now but elite would have to sacrifice oil, nuclear, electricity, ect.. sales if they release it. Any normal man would happily release it but the elite are not just normal people. They are incredibly insane and psychotic. </p></li>
<li><p>The one &quot;brilliant&quot; thing the elite did was to make the people think that they themselves are responsible for living in shambles. They essentially painting mankind as being unable to to upkeep the economy which ends up making mankind lose faith in themselves. It worked but this can be reversed. Once we break through into the vaults and release the technology, resources, and wealth, you will see the world go on hyper speed towards a higher, well maintained planet for us all. We will all have a higher quality of life, a higher paycheck, ect.. if we continue with capitalism. Technology simply makes life a whole lot easier and much more prosperous for all. I can&#39;t tell you what this technology entails but all the major cures for most things under the sun exist right now. Technology touches every part of life. </p></li>
<li><p>They are constantly milking the economy from any angle they can. They control everything from the top so even if you have your own business, you pay taxes to the Khazarian mafia one way or another. Putting taxes to the side, lets discuss the banks. We all know the Federal Reserve is a private enterprise that gives money to the government on a high interest rate meaning that all your money you pay in taxes goes directly into the pockets of the Federal Reserve. In reality, taxes should be used entirely on the good of the people and not going into the hands of the elite. They tricked you though. They claim taxes is entirely for the benefit of mankind although a lot of it is pocketed by the elite. Local banks also loan out money they don&#39;t even have through credit cards and loans that have very high interest rates. The government is also advised to spend money as sloppily as possible to further reduce the positive effects of government on the people. They literally dump oceans of money into stuff like the CIA or the shills on reddit or the military or anything else in order to be in a perpetual state of need. By dumping money into stupid and very expensive projects, they burden the country with debt and that burden is supposed to eventually lead to the people giving up and giving the elite even more power by consent so they can save us from the perils of life. The whole thing is a gimmick. This will only happen if the elite need to prove to you that they fixed the economy like they are now with the end of the Obama administration. They artificially pumped up the stock prices to make you think Obama accomplished his mission of improving the economy and then they plan on ruining it while Trump is in office so it looks like Trump messed up the economy. The amount of money we are talking about here is staggering. They literally, purposefully waste insane amounts of money on very stupid causes that could have been used to actually help the people. </p></li>
<li><p>Economists in schools are not actually taught how to improve the economy. They are just given a little bit of info with missing components. For example, imagine if someone told you how to upkeep your car but never mentioned anything about changing the oil. This way, the economists create mathematical graphs that guarantee a better economy but then they are so surprised when it doesn&#39;t work out. This is because there are seriously missing components from the economic model that are purposefully withheld from economic college students. </p></li>
<li><p>The shittier idea is usually the better one. For example, there are 2 types of medicine. Natural medicine exists but a lot of Drs who have pursued it have been killed. Why? Because natural medicines are so damn inexpensive that the elite won&#39;t make much money out of it. Imagine if you got cancer and ate a mix of leaves to cure it. How much would that cost you? $100? $500? Now, imagine how much a cycle of chemotherapy would cost? A year supply of chemo is a few hundred grand. They don&#39;t even care if you don&#39;t have the money. If you don&#39;t pay, you die so its all good with the elite either way. Prisons are more profitable than rehabs and the elite can give a shit about people suffering in a cage for decades. This way, when prisoners are released, they are so insane that they further commit crimes and go back to jail. In jail, they work for 10 cents an hour as a slave. They also keep the corporations who sell goods to jails very wealthy. Therefore, it is better to ruin the prisoners rather than help them. </p></li>
<li><p>There are many, many gimmicks both large and small that follow this path to destruction. Even if the world was to totally collapse, the elite would still have money. One reason they want to bring wages lower and lower is so that they can bribe people easier and hire people easier. For example, some Chinese workers work 24+ hours in a day. These are essentially like slaves but nobody would work that many hours for such low wages if the world economy was booming as it should be. Nobody would take a job like that but since they have generated so much fake disparity, they can easily hire Chinese laborers as they are extremely desperate. The desperation also pumps life into gangs, mafia, and other criminals which eventually further enriches the elite. All these criminals are processed in and out of courts/prisons which all equals money to the elite. </p></li>
<li><p>The elite have gamed the system so that everything you do costs money. Got the AC on at night? Your spending money in your sleep. Imagine if we had that 0 point technology and got AC for free. All that gas you fill in your tank goes to the elite. They nickle and dime you anyway they can. I remember when they used to charge for cell phone texts even though it literally cost them much less than a penny to send a text out for you. They just nickle and dime the population to death and out of all these desperate citizens, they recruit some of them to do their dirty work. They can pay anything they like. Look at Black Lives Matter who, in reality, is a bunch of poor black men and women who need to eat so they succumb to the will of the elite. Same with the online shills. That $15 an hour is great money. The fake protesters were making a whopping $1200 a week (if i remember correctly). These people aren&#39;t evil, they are desperate and they are falling into the hands of the elite. </p></li>
<li><p>Have you noticed how corporations have spread out of their local areas and across the country? They hold a monopoly more or less across the country. Walmart covers all your needs and they pay their employees shit money while sending billions every year to china since china has a good slave system going. Best Buy runs the electronics. Every city has these similar companies that exist all over the country. If a few people control all the major retail stores, then all the money spent goes into a few people&#39;s pockets when its all said and done. </p></li>
<li><p>God forbid if you have kids nowadays. They will bombard  you in every direction and if you divorce, they will send cops your way for child support. Life has become so expensive and the money supply has gone so far down that many people just refuse to have kids anymore. The only side benefit to this is that it is a responsible move not to have kids since the planet is mostly full and we could depopulate by not having kids but the elite aren&#39;t worried about all that. All they care about is the future slave they will make of your kids and all those loans they will hand down to them. </p></li>
<li><p>Finally, although there is a lot more that can be said, they literally start fake wars, fund both sides of the war at high interest rates, and leave it up to the people to pay it off. They literally make fortunes out of war which is the worst type of environment imaginable (along with jails). </p></li>
</ol>

<p>Now, obviously, we can push through and learn their secrets and find these vaults. We can boot the elite out and share power worldwide or we can simply stop using money altogether and transfer into a cashless/creditless economy called Sacred Economics which would totally destroy the elites power very quickly. Its up to all of us to decide which way we will go but remember this. The elite have been draining the economy for decades. They are responsible for the drags on the economy and the depressions/repressions. Humans have total control over all this but they are keeping these methods a secret from us because their worst nightmare is the rise of the goy. They have painted us as demons. They have brainwashed us into thinking the shitty society is all our own fault. Have you ever thought that bank robbers are so desperate and so they risk 25 years in prison to rob a bank? Don&#39;t you think we would have less drug dealers, ect.. if the economy was booming? Nobody likes crime but sometimes a man is looking at a $250,000 bill from the hospital that will follow him around for the rest of his life and he is desperate to pay it off. A shitty economic system always makes the elite richer so the shittier the better. It is very important for people to understand these concepts because by knowing this, we can plot our next move on how to reverse these issues. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Economics is the study of how we can use our resources most efficiently yet our economy is based on consumping useless items, the exact opposite of what an economy should do.

<p>Don&#39;t know if you know this, but wages and prices are determined by the market in this country, and most of the world for that matter.  Your services are worth whatever someone is willing to pay you.  Pumping the economy full of cash does not make your services more valuable. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Think of it like this. </p>

<p>Imagine if we had 100 villagers in a village. Let&#39;s assume 1 villager is hogging up most of the money through his various businesses across the village. </p>

<p>We have say... 3 options. </p>

<ol>
<li><p>Give them 1000 dollars to spread around. This amount of money is way to low considering 1 guy has a large chunk of all the money in existence. This literally leaves no money on the table and people are unable to trade at all since there isn&#39;t enough loose cash AND a large chunk of this loose cash is in the hands of the elite 1% so there&#39;s even less than $1000. </p></li>
<li><p>Now imagine we gave the villages say... $10,000 cash. This is about $100 for each villager but since the 1% is hogging a lot, they get less than $100 each. The value of the dollar is still strong although the villages aren&#39;t actually seeing 10k in the economy. They are seeing less but we don&#39;t have the data in front of us like the government does, but if 10k is in fact enough for a booming economy (meaning there is enough cash to go around for trade), then we should be good. </p></li>
<li><p>Another option is dropping 100k into the 100 man village but that seems excessive and would reduce the value of the dollar. </p></li>
</ol>

<p>Basically, you can go low, you can&#39;t go high. America is in a state of low and the money we do have just gets vacuumed up by the elite and is often sent over to China. I hear the 1950s was booming. I wonder how much was around in loose cash at that time.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Dropping <em>any</em> amount of cash into the village is going to reduce the value of the dollar accordingly.</p>

<p>A dollar bill is only worth what someone will give you in exchange for it.  If there are suddenly more dollars in circulation, the folks selling good will demand more dollars for their product.</p>

<p>Just giving people cash does not increase their wealth or buying power, it inflates the currency and lowers it&#39;s value.</p>

<p>Contrary to popular belief the wealthy don&#39;t just sit on their piles of money.  They use to acquire assets (like houses and cars) and they pump it into companies large and small by purchasing stock and funding new ventures.</p>

<p>The 1 villager in your scenario who owns all of the businesses in town is paying maintenance men to work on his businesses, he is paying employees to run his businesses, he is paying taxes to pay for fireman and policemen to protect his businesses, he is paying insurance companies to insure his assets.  He&#39;s not sitting on a vault of money Scrooge McDuck style, otherwise his businesses would fail and he would soon be out of money.</p>

<p>Money is <em>always</em> moving in our western capitalist system.  Look at the $ volume of trading on just one stock exchange for on day, it&#39;s a mind-bending amount of cash.</p>

<p>Long story short, there is no &quot;shortage of loose money&quot; in our economy.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I actually believe the wealthy have hoards upon hoards of wealth. If you think they are barely paying the bills and don&#39;t have any for savings, you are wrong. Even if they buy homes, those homes are worth a lot of money and so they still have the money once they sell the home. The elite are able to save insane amounts of money even after paying employees. They don&#39;t do anything. They just had a good idea that blew up at the time and so they sit back and collect money while overseeing the business. That&#39;s fine. The problem is that the amount of money they collect is so massive that they are getting much more than they are putting into the economy. They don&#39;t run the companies. The entire employee base does. They only hold 1 part so if they have 30,000 employees, then the boss is 1/30,000. Each of those positions are important and need a human to fill it yet in Walmart, employees are making around $11.50 an hour while the owners are running a Trillion dollar company. </p>

<p>Also, if less money into the village means higher value, then why don&#39;t you just put 1 cent into the economy? That way, the 1 penny that exists is worth more than any other dollar on earth? You can&#39;t can you? It simply wouldn&#39;t work. A low amount of dollars into the economy won&#39;t work either AND if the government put a lot of money into the economy but the elite steals 90% of it, then that will not work either. We can very easily fix these problems by putting a maximum wage of 25 million dollars NET per year. That is 2 million in the pockets of the elite per month or $67,000 a day! Is this not a Godly enough lifestyle? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You are telling me a lot of you &quot;beliefs&quot; but I have a feeling you don&#39;t have much experience or data to back it up.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve met, eaten with, and spent time with some very wealthy folks.  Every single one of them has been frugal, carefully tracks their spending, and worked like a dog to earn the wealth they have.</p>

<p>All you are throwing out are the same tired stereotypes about wealthy people &quot;stealing&quot; their money off the backs of their hardworking employees.  This is patently false.  A cashier at WalMart could not do the CEO&#39;s job.  A busboy at Red Lobster could not run a chain of restaurants.</p>

<p>People are earn what they have.  Yes a few get lucky or inherit their wealth, but they are only a few.</p>

<p>Also, capping salaries because &quot;they don&#39;t need any more money&quot; is the exact opposite of the economic system that led to the so-called booming 50s that you referred to earlier.</p>

<p>It sounds to me like you disapprove of the capitalist system, is that true?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ok, here&#39;s one bit of proof. Why is the Federal Reserve a private company that lends cash for interest to our government in a perpetual motion of debt that can never be paid off? And why do they tax us to pay this Federal Reserve interest?</p>

<p>It&#39;s all about more and more power to the elite. They want you to think they are just sitting around barely paying the bills but its not true. They live like Gods. They own your media and pump out all kinds of propaganda into your mind. They hire fake protestors to trigger a civil war. It&#39;s a joke in every sense of the word. I&#39;m guessing your Republican because this is the one thing Dems never understood about Republicans. How can you believe this non-sense? Is it the fake promise that one day, you too will be rich and protected? That&#39;s a joke. One in a million will make it, but the rest of the country will struggle in a 9-5 for the rest of their lives. Democrats also have all kinds of weird thinking patterns that the Republicans can&#39;t understand. I will admit that but the bottom line is that the whole system is rigged to make the rich so damn rich that the entire planet suffocates and then they can come in and be the &quot;hero&quot;. Oh, but being the hero comes at a price: More Power. </p>

<p>I&#39;m gonna leave this thread with one final thought:</p>

<p>People make it every day.  People play the stock market, they study trends, they make sales commissions, they invent new products and services.  You can&#39;t deny that these things happen.  Please try to be a little less cynical about the ups and downs of capitalism and appreciate the unprecedented opportunities it provides.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I feel like you have a pretty strong and informed perspective here, but there are a couple flaws that are detracting from the overall picture that will limit the appeal outside of a certain audience.</p>

<p>The underlying premise is right; our democracy has devolved into a plutocracy .  I think that 99% of people would agree with you there.  The goal of the plutarchs is to fleece the &#39;middle class&#39; for as much as they can, which creates downward pressure overall.  This is pretty readily observable - consumer debt levels at all time highs, the appearance of market competition but really just a series of oligopolies etc.  You&#39;re not wrong about this.</p>

<p>But where I think you start to lose people / start having misconceptions is with the whole khazarian thing....and then economics.  </p>

<p>First, the khazarian mafia thing.  Where did you pick up this perspective?  Need to be careful about your sources - my understanding is that the thirteenth tribe or whatever, the book that really kicked off the khazarian mafia chatter, has been largely debunked.  Either way, by bringing this language into the conversation, you are needlessly courting controversy and error.</p>

<p>There is no need to bring ethnicity, gender, blood, race, whatever, into the conversation.  My understanding is that these surface-level divisions are used by plutarchs as cover; to distract the overall narrative and to keep them out of the picture, generally speaking.  </p>

<p>Yes, generally speaking, regular people are like ... less than human for the ultra rich.  I&#39;m struggling for the actual description here.  Being ultra rich doesn&#39;t make you intrinsically evil, but it&#39;s easy to see how it would cause a canyon-like divide in terms of perspective.   Like pawns on a chess board - that&#39;s probably it.  Again, there doesn&#39;t need to be a racial / religious / cultural tone to this observation, and you are probably doing your perspective a disservice by including it.</p>

<p>Second - economics.   I agree with you that the money based system is not an ideal one.  Capitalism in many ways is directly comparable to feudalism, except with a bit of anonymity for the plutarchs.  The stock market allows for centralization of ownership like nobody&#39;s business - the lords don&#39;t even need to live on the land, or in the same country anymore.  I guess I would describe capitalism as being, in a sense, a natural extension of feudalism.</p>

<p>But until we figure out how to move to a post-currency society, we are stuck with money.  Everything is relative.  If you are paying a low skilled worker 100k, what does a highly skilled dr earn?</p>

<p>If you research the arguments around minimum wage and/or universal income, you will see that having more money in a system doesn&#39;t translate to having more wealth for individual members, which is what I think you are trying to get at.</p>

<p>If the average person earns 4x more in an economy, eventually the goods in that economy will cost about 4x more.  That&#39;s a super high level simplification, but it&#39;s not because of plutarchs directly.  It&#39;s just plain ol&#39; supply and demand.  Now you could make arguments about the plutarchs owning all the capital and therefore having control over supply, and people may entertain that conversation, because in many ways there is an artificial scarcity being placed on us, which ends up being used to fleece us out of necessary resources.  </p>

<p>But if you are trying to say that a walmart retail worker should earn the same thing that a person who invests tens of thousands in education and practices a highly skilled craft that takes years to learn, you are going to lose people.   </p>

<p>I mean, realistically, eventually technology will replace a lot of the low skilled work.  And possibly a lot of what is currently considered &#39;skilled work&#39; .   Then what are we going to do?  In a capitalist paradigm, it is hard to see how this ends up working out well</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Nope. I went to economics class. It is not about the elite, the elite, the elite. That&#39;s brainwashing you have. It&#39;s not about money money money either. Remember, USA is built on debt, those bills don&#39;t pay for credit, they pay for debt. Economics is about lies and leaders of lies. They lie to you about where the money comes from. You have guys out there, they have no money, but their country cooks the books for them to make them look like millionaires so they can run up to a guy to kill him in a political revenge. You have children out there, labeled as killers, and really nobody died by them they just got bribed by a judge to do a stupid face to cover up for a state incompetence. It is about the door and the lock on the door. The government locked its doors to the public and turned on the TV set and hoped consumers would disappear until they were needed to fill hospitals and jails. There is only trafficking out there. Not anything you got taught at the education factory.</p>
