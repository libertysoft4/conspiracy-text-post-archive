        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I understand why so many people have been charmed by Donald Trump. For one, he is a very charismatic character. You may disagree, however there&#39;s no denying that the man knows how to disarm people with his straightforward talk and &quot;no bullshit&quot; mannerisms. His status as a self made wealthy figure is the epitome of the American Dream, and he claims to have a vast knowledge of the mechanics of business, which we would desperately need in a president given our country&#39;s disastrous economic situation. His most appealing characteristic however, is his impression of being <strong>outside</strong> of the global elite system of control. His supporters believe that he is truly independent and could not be swayed by political persuasion. This has lured many of us in the &quot;conspiracy community&quot; into lending him out trust for the moment. After all, we were able to stop the Clinton campaign from securing a rigged election, right? We beat the system, didn&#39;t we?</p>

<p>I&#39;m here to tell you that I believe Trump is actually a carefully placed Trojan Horse, A false prophet. I&#39;m actually surprised more of us aren&#39;t immediately skeptical of this guy. We have been burned on the last how many presidents? And we&#39;re just going to put blind faith into this guy, and assume the globalists didn&#39;t have some sort of influence over this guy? You know the social engineers are going to expand and contract their narrative to trick us and lure is into a situation that is beneficial to their success in creating a world government, and it makes perfect sense that they would try to lure the &quot;conspiracy community&quot; and the conservative base toward a false prophet who has the impression of an independent, non corrupt &quot;Everyman&quot; that we can trust. Alex Jones held the fucking torch and led his supporters into pledging allegiance to him. At that point I knew something was off, because Jones used to preach that the two party system was a ruse, a scam to divide the people into two ideologies. He is now obviously controlled opposition, and it&#39;s pretty depressing because he used to be relatively legitimate. </p>

<p>This idea that the media was constantly attacking him only adds credibility to the narrative that he was an &quot;outsider&quot; and that the system didn&#39;t want him to be elected. However, he got TONS of publicity from all of those attacks and that just fueled his fanbase into a growth, because it made him look like a real threat to the system, and that earned the trust of even skeptical supporters. </p>

<p>This was all done by design folks, planned years in advance. Now, since they effectively deemed Trump and his suppprters as the face of &quot;Racist&quot; and &quot;misogynyst&quot; culture (which I&#39;ll admit, I don&#39;t believe the majority of his supporters are racist at all, they are good hardworking people who just want to believe in a political figure who is on their side and he was appealing to them), the liberal side of the spectrum is fueled with hatred against them and the stage is set for some sort of civil unrest or massive social fallout. Again, this is all being done by design, and they are going to try and lure the independent thinkers like us who don&#39;t trust the establishment and the Clintons into throwing our support behind a false prophet authoritarian puppet. You <em>really</em> think he&#39;s going to audit the federal reserve? </p>

<p>Do you <em>really</em> think he&#39;s going to investigate 9/11? Fuck no, I&#39;m sorry to say it but just appears as if this guy was simply playing a predetermined role, of a self made business man who was an outsider that would appeal to our community. <strong>And worst of all, if the &quot;conspiracy community&quot; becomes associated with Trump, it will delegitimize everything we stand for because he is demonized in so many people&#39;s minds. It will discredit our message, whether you believe he&#39;s legit or not.</strong></p>

<p>With that being said, I still believe Trump supporters have our best interests at heart and believe in what we do. They know the fed is out of control, that the monetary system is rigged, that 9/11 was staged to justify foreign wars and warrantless spying, that criminal elements have taken control of our government, and they are fucking our lives up. We need to unite and band together, but I urge you all to remain critically skeptical of Donald Trump, because I believe he may very well be a false prophet that was specifically chosen by the elite and marketed to us the way he was in an attempt to create an undercover &quot;outsider&quot; false prophet, to be used as a catylist for the impending social unrest that awaits. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s why we shouldn&#39;t jump to any conclusions either for or against him until we see what he does in office. I can see why he&#39;s embraced by some conspiracy theorists. He&#39;s openly talked about conspiracy theories and he&#39;s talked about draining the swamp. Not to mention the fact that the media, DNC, CIA, and his own party, the GOP, have tried to sabotage his presidency before it even begins.</p>

<p>However, anybody who&#39;s been into conspiracies long enough knows that everything is usually a carefully scripted play. Once you add in Trump&#39;s appointments and his stance on Israel, it should make us pause for concern. </p>

<p>I think either side could be equally right, and I&#39;m already dreading all of the posts saying, &quot;You see? I told you so! You&#39;re all sheep.&quot; I&#39;m taking a very neutral approach until I see what happens in the first few months, but deep down I&#39;m praying that things finally change for the better</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I envy your ability to remain neutral. I feel very invested in this at this point and just want it to work, for the benefit of us all. But it seems like people are determined for it not to work out, I don&#39;t know.  It seems like people on both sides are starting to lose their grasp on reality. And not just regular people but in the government as well. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh, I completely agree with you. Even if I&#39;m neutral on Trump at the moment, I still hate people trying to sacrifice the guy before he&#39;s even stepped into the Oval Office. To me it all seems like a pathetic effort to cover up corruption. And it makes me sick that people are more worried about their corruption being exposed than they are about the state of our nation. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Agreed. First republican I didn&#39;t vote for.</p>

<p>When the &#39;trump prophecy&#39; made its appearance, I knew something was up. Think about it, in the eyes of the government, who is the scariest demographic when it comes to revolt? White conservative Christians. What better way to convince them he is on their side than a fake prophecy? </p>

<p>It blows my mind how many people, around the time of elections, seem to think this is it, this is when everything changes.. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I hate this concept, why does every leader have to be instantly praised/compared or thought of as a prophet? As someone who is a christian, and has come to understand the definition of a prophet, the only &quot;not-false prophet&quot; is Jesus, and I have never thought of any person as Jesus, not Trump, not Bill Clinton, not Ozzy Osborne, not Dwayne Wade, and certainly not Obama. And for muslims, the only prophet is Mohammad and Jews don&#39;t believe their prophet will ever come, and they are the only three groups I have come to understand believe in prophets, so what group of people are you exactly speaking towards? In all seriousness, the tendency of humans to instantly think of any leader in any way relating to a divine prophet is one of the biggest pitfalls of humanity, it results in destructive herd mentality.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I would most likely bet that all traces of 9/11 were destroyed or carried out of the federal government by this past chain administration, it could be possible Trump is in the same boat, he knows the prior administrative chain was behind it, but there is no proof to back up substantiated claims. I think for the present, there will be no expose of past incidents, especially because an incredible amount of work needs to be put forth in matters of the present and not the past, if his motives for MAGA are to be believed. One thing is for certain, this should be a very interesting period of time.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Chaos my friend, is the best answer to this question. Chaos is not the part of any well construed plan formulated for the white-house. On the streets? In other countries? In religious places of worship? Yes, the Clinton lineage wants chaos there, but not in the white-house or the seat of power of their ilk. Trump is a wild card, but with all of the chaos he is creating, I can definitely say he is not working for them. I can also say he is definitely not a prophet or the ultimate focal point for this battle to uncover and reclaim the government, but he is creating chaos, which gives the nation time for me people to become self-aware. So I am definitely for the movement of the Trump Train, especially if it means colliding and steamrolling every known enemy entity while we can formulate from the shadows. It is far better for the nation right now that our true enemies fight among themselves.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Mainstream Christian belief is that Jesus replaced the bearings of the old testament and is the only Prophet, or human with divine interpretation from God, his father. Besides the sect of fundamentalist Christian&#39;s, the old testament is more or less of little practical concern and is obsolete and not based on evidence, more or less a book of stories. Take it with a grain of salt is my best advice because on one hand, if you believe everything in the entire bible is the word of God, then from the old testament you have to believe the world is 7,000 years old among many other things proven not factual.</p>

<p>“By this you know the Spirit of God: every spirit that confesses that Jesus Christ has come in the flesh is from God, and every spirit that does not confess Jesus is not from God. This is the spirit of the antichrist, which you heard was coming and now is in the world already.” 1 John 4:2-3</p>

<p>To me trump is a phenomenon in American politics that is a little unique. I think this warrants close scrutiny or at least not turning a blind eye. If he is some catalyst for the globalist agenda we did a piss poor job outing him. I can&#39;t predict the future though so maybe he will deliver all his campaign promises.

    <div class="md"><p>I would have to agree with Hubris_elite, because if things with Trump go south into the enemies plans, then it will be more important than ever to follow politics because action will be needed more than ever. Trump was the first politician I ever really &quot;followed&quot; as-well although I dug more into his past than I did his current political race until now as hes President-elect, but if he serves the Illuminati times will become increasingly dangerous for anyone who stands out, so I will be watching more intently than ever for at least my own personal safety.</p>

<p>A great leader should view the ultimate position of power as an honorable burden and would woefully accept an appointment to such a place in society.</p>

<p>Do you think Trump really wants to be a servant of the people?  Has he done anything in his life to indicate he is not a self-serving elitist?  I would argue Trump is easily defined as the opposite of this in every fiber of his being, along with his entire cabinet.</p>

<p>We need a lot more decent people to choose political careers as an honorable burden, rather than a career/business/social opportunity, if we are ever going to begin diluting the corruption entrenched in global politics.</p>

<p>We need large scale organizing in every state to start recruiting, creating, and voting for third party candidates (neither the Democratic or Republican party are the answer at this point) if we stand any chance of breaking the shackles of crony capitalism.  Think about this over the next four years as the ruling elite (including and especially Trump) continue to wage war, destroy the environment, marginalize the poor, and enslave the common person with debt.</p>
