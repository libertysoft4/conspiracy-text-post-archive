        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I noticed many comments tonight under the belief that Correct the Record was dismantled after the election. This is only partially true. </p>

<p>Correct the Record was originally a <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2015/05/12/how-a-super-pac-plans-to-coordinate-directly-with-hillary-clintons-campaign/">spin-off from David Brock&#39;s other super PAC American Bridge</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>On Tuesday, Correct the Record, a pro-Clinton rapid-response operation, announced it was splitting off from its parent American Bridge and will work in coordination with the Clinton campaign as a stand-alone super PAC. The group’s move was first reported by the New York Times.</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p>Although Correct the Record was dismantled after the election, its parent, American Bridge, is still alive. In fact, American Bridge is doing so well that it was <a href="http://thehill.com/blogs/ballot-box/308978-top-dem-super-pac-launches-anti-trump-war-room">tapped to lead the DNC&#39;s anti-Trump campaign</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Liberal political operative David Brock, a close ally of former Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton, told reporters on Tuesday that his super PAC, American Bridge, has established a war room that will act as an aggressor and a watchdog for the Trump transition team and his incoming administration.</p>

<p>...</p>

<p><strong>American Bridge has established a rapid response team that will fact-check Trump’s claims in real time.</strong> Experts are said to be combing through Trump’s domestic and foreign business interests, his personal life, his charitable foundation and those he has associated with, using Freedom of Information Act requests to uncover new details.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Emphasis mine. Notice how both Correct the Record and American Bridge use the same &quot;rapid response&quot; terminology to describe their operations.</p>

<p>tl;dr:  Correct the Record may have died but its parent super PAC is still alive and leading the charge as a &quot;rapid response team&quot; against Trump.</p>

<p>This is probably why <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> is currently overrun with shills that bear strong resemblance to CTR.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>CTR was mostly a bunch of Multi Level Marketing companies that used religious cult members as labor. Go look at the Barrier Breakers page on facebook; it&#39;s basically just  foreigners from really poor countries who all seem to work the same social media promotional job, and who tend to be members of Soka Gakkai, the FLDS, Sufi Islamic sects, etc.  I think it&#39;s a global immigration program. A Soka Gakkai building magically popped up in my town a few months ago, and then disappeared immediately after the election. On every level possible, the Democratic party is a giant pyramid scheme.</p>
