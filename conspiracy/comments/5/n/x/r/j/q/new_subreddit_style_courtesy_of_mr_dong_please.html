        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Hey Guys, so Mr_Dong and I have worked on the new style the last few months. Really it&#39;s just a subtraction of style, we didn&#39;t add much, just removed old style to clean it up a bit more.</p>

<p>Let us know in the comments any style issues, with screencaps and what browser with version you use.</p>

<p><strong>Try to give constructive feedback / changes, saying &quot;It sucks&quot; provides us nothing. Compared to other subreddits our style is really old and needed updating and as you can see below, the changes are as minimal as can be</strong></p>

<p>Differences can be found here: <a href="https://www.diffchecker.com/UoJe0flw">https://www.diffchecker.com/UoJe0flw</a></p>

<p><strong>Changes that were made:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><p>Removed the black outline to standardize the viewport more</p></li>
<li><p>Less black, more light grey</p></li>
<li><p>Sidebar is thinner, and has bootstrap style buttons for the IRC / Confirmed Conspiracies</p></li>
<li><p>Old style up vote down vote</p></li>
<li><p>Top menu bar is simpler</p></li>
<li><p>Added small <a href="/r/videos">/r/videos</a> post flair for voat, youtube, twitter, imgur</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Old Style: <a href="http://i.imgur.com/o77xOAx.png">http://i.imgur.com/o77xOAx.png</a></p>

<p>Thank you.</p>

<h1>Changelog (Updated last at: 00:14 UTC)</h1>

<ul>
<li><p>Made top bar darker to mimic old style</p></li>
<li><p>MIB Snoo is back (higher quality than my old one)</p></li>
<li><p>Dark header is back. The new style is very close to the original with having a bit more modernity.</p></li>
<li><p>Changed mobile banner back to orange</p></li>
<li><p>Re-added the original snoos, just higher resolution</p></li>
<li><p>Added nightmode fix</p></li>
</ul>

<p>EDIT: <strong>Looks like we&#39;re done here guys. Thank you for the suggestions, all that were asked were added back i (barring putting back the old clunky low res style). I&#39;m stepping down now.</strong> </p>

<p>I don&#39;t have a problem with changing it per se, but I think regular users ought to consent to it or at least be told if we wanted a change. Just my 2 cents.</p>

<p>Why build your base CSS to require night mode? That&#39;s fine if you don&#39;t visit any other subs, but it really is not the way night mode is intended to be used.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>For those who are unaware, <a href="/u/enfrozt">/u/enfrozt</a> was a mod on <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> a few years back, and was kind enough to rejoin the team on a temporary basis to assist with the roll out of this new CSS.</p>

<p>We are very grateful for the work that he has done, and we very much appreciate his willingness to answer the call when the mod team reached out to ask for assistance.</p>

<p>In other news, due to IRL constraints, mr_dong stepped down last night from the mod team after many, many years of dedicated service to this community. mr_dong provided invaluable leadership throughout his time on the mod team, and he reflected the very best of what a reddit mod should be; dedicated, unbiased, and willing to lead by example when the chips were thrown on the table.</p>

<p>There will be a larger post incoming from the mods with regards the current state of the subreddit; as it truly has been one hell of a week, after sustained brigades from subs as wide ranging as <a href="/r/outoftheloop">/r/outoftheloop</a> to <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a>, along with an article in The Verge (which we were never contacted about for comment, wonderful journalism on behalf of the Verge! /s), were taken up by the usual suspects (<a href="/r/top">/r/top</a>********ed and srd), who have always jumped at any opportunity to sow discord between the userbase of this sub and it&#39;s moderators.</p>

<p>That said, we will address that situation further in the coming days; however, we did want to note that <a href="/u/enfrozt">/u/enfrozt</a> will be stepping down after 24-48 hours of troubleshooting the new css (if the need arises), just to settle any concerns in that regard.</p>

<p>Cheers and thanks to all of you for keeping this community strong in the face of mounting opposition and persistent brigading.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I mostly mod in <a href="/r/wikileaks">/r/wikileaks</a> for oversight purposes, although the situation in <a href="/r/pizzagate">/r/pizzagate</a> was entirely unfortunate.</p>

<p>For those unaware, I was a mod in <a href="/r/pizzagate">/r/pizzagate</a> until a large influx of concern trolling by srd and elsewhere lead to my removal from <a href="/r/pizzagate">/r/pizzagate</a> as a mod. This was truly unfortunate as every other mod of <a href="/r/pizzagate">/r/pizzagate</a> was new to reddit, and the admins really dislike moderators who don&#39;t have a feel for the &quot;nuanced and unwritten rules of reddit&quot;. The dislike arises from the fact that mods who are new to reddit don&#39;t truly grasp the suite of available tools on the platform, and manual moderation of questionable content (Personal Information in this case) is a very nuanced task. I wrote more about that situation <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/5eis9z/the_admin_closure_of_rpizzagate_and_its/dacywfy/">here</a>, and concluded at the time that;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>a perfect storm of mechanisms came together to engulf the sub in a conflagration; as an inexperienced mod team, with no understanding of how reddit admins apply their tos during maor &quot;shit storms&quot;, simply let their guard down and received their inevitable third strike. With no presence of any automod rules to help deal with the large influx of doxxing following the NYT piece (You can read former reddit ceo Yishan Lee&#39;s comment on how press effects reddit operations here, wherein yishan makesit quite clear that during &quot;press events&quot;, the influx of new users tends to overwhelm a community), the mods of <a href="/r/pizzagate">/r/pizzagate</a> were only one slip up away from being banned. Whether that slip up came in the form of a malicious actor intentionally trying to subvert the flow of information by having the sub banned, or simply a new user unfamilair with the rules of reddit as a whole, is, for the most part irrelevant as the sub was literally on its death kneel and there was nothing anyone could have done to save her.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>To that end, the goons from srd and elsewhere realized that by sowing discord in <a href="/r/pizzagate">/r/pizzagate</a>, and having the only &quot;reddit savvy&quot; mod removed from the ream, the sub would inevitably be banned for failure to comply with the standards set by the reddit admins (often silently implemented), over the past 10 years on this platform.</p>

<p>A former admin of reddit (the admin who actually oversaw the <a href="/r/pizzagate">/r/pizzagate</a> situation) has said that <a href="/r/pizzagate">/r/pizzagate</a> most likely would not have been banned if I had remained a member of the mod team. And that is what is truly the most frustrating aspect of that entire situation; the srd goons actually managed to get a subreddit banned by preying on a community simply because the goons disliked the nature of the pizzagate investigation.</p>

<p>So it goes on reddit I suppose :/</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve always set my preferences to ignore subreddit styles because 99% of them are so full of extraneous junk. Even this sub had too much.</p>

<p>The changes you&#39;ve made makes it sooo much better and easier to read. I especially like the removal of all the black. Thank you.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>the style is all right. I have my likes and dislikes about it but it doesn&#39;t really matter. More than that I&#39;ll just say thanks for working on it. One thing though that seems to be more a technical issue than a personal preference is the whole header area in the top left corner seems all bunched together. Like the snoo graphic and the &quot;reddit&quot; graphic and the text to the right of it are all very close to each other to a degree that does not seem aesthetically ideal. Just a heads up</p>
