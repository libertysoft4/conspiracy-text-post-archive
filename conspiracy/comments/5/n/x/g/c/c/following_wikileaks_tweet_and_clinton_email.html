<p>Pieczenik - &quot;if the FBI and Justice Department fail to garner timely indictments against Clinton and co- conspirators, NYPD will go public with the damaging emails now in the hands of FBI Director James Comey and many FBI field offices&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>How so? Truepundit literally published fake news like the &quot; drone him&quot; story. Amongst many, many others. </p>

<p><a href="http://m.dailykos.com/story/2016/11/2/1590342/--True-Pundit-and-Drone-this-Guy-A-brief-update-from-the-conspiracy-theory-machine-factory">http://m.dailykos.com/story/2016/11/2/1590342/--True-Pundit-and-Drone-this-Guy-A-brief-update-from-the-conspiracy-theory-machine-factory</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>On October 2, True Pundit posted an article claiming that during a meeting of “State’s top brass” in 2010 to discuss how to deal with Wikileaks, Clinton asked of Assange, “Can’t we just drone this guy?” The site only attributes the comment to anonymous “State Department sources. ”The fact-checking website Snopes looked intothe True Pundit article and found their claim “unproven,” pointing out that the source of their purported Clinton quote was “a vague and anonymous reference that does not yield to verification.” (It’s also unclear why multiple sources with knowledge of this supposed incident that took place in a meeting of senior State Department staff would choose to leak them to a minor conspiracy blogger rather than a credible news outlet. )</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh, when the key is cracked, sadly you will know it in a few awful ways.  If it is as half bad as expected, it will shake a lot of things up, maybe to the core.  You won&#39;t need to open it, people will be diving into it and releasing things.  It will be like in Ghostbusters when the laser containment unit is turned off and everything flies out,</p>

<p>This <strong>initial release</strong> consists of material from the FBI&#39;s files related to the William J. Clinton Foundation, a non-profit 501(c)(3) organization. The bulk of these records come from a 2001 FBI investigation into the pardon of Marc Rich (1934-2013), aka Marcell David Reich, by President Clinton in 2001; it was closed in 2005. The material is heavily redacted due to personal privacy protections and grand jury secrecy rules.</p>
