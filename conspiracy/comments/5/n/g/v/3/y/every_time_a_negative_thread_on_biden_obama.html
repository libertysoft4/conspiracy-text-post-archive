<p>Here is a fact to consider: 97% of all women in the United States who are alcoholics/drug addicts were molested when they were children.</p>

<p>America is crawling with millions of pedophiles, and since Pizzagate, the pedophiles are shaking in their bootstraps because they are afraid they will be discovered. Well, I have some really good news. Once Trump is president, every person on the internet that has called Pizzagate a &quot;hoax&quot; and &quot;conspiracy&quot; will be investigated, and if found guilty...well, we will just have to wait and see.</p>
