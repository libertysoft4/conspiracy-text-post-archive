    <div class="md"><p>In OPs defense, majority of what people are posting against Senor Trump are:</p>

<p>1) Conspiracy theories propagated by the MSM, such as the Russian collusion and pissgate, etc.
2) &quot;OMG! Look he&#39;s just like HRC&quot; posts regarding his selection of Goldman Sucks affiliates. This is concerning but is not a conspiracy. It&#39;s a fact. If someone wants to write a post concerning their theory Trump was a bold faced liar who baited the conspiracy crowd into voting for him, that would be more of a conspiracy. 
I agree that until Trump gets into office and starts dealing with the real shit we won&#39;t be able to tell how much lying he was doing.
3) a BUNCH of fucking whiny posts about why people aren&#39;t up Trumps ass as much as they are HRCs. These are just shit stirring posts that ARE annoying as fuck.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>As someone who fought hard against Hillary and am now fighting hard against Trump, I think it would be awesome if people would stop taking sides and stop calling people shills for posting facts that don&#39;t jibe with their pollyanna narrative.</p>

<p>I also think that people are refusing to look at the intelligence available because they&#39;re afraid of what they&#39;ll see. Ultimately, it doesn&#39;t matter - because what power do we have if he&#39;s charged or not charged with treason - but why not be informed? Why shut our eyes to the data that&#39;s out there? A lot of Trump fanatics I know won&#39;t even read his Twitter feed &#39;cause they can&#39;t handle it, and they&#39;re self-censoring - a real loss as they&#39;re definitely keeping themselves away from some really meaty conspiracies .</p>

<p>You people need to deal with the fact that most conspiracy theorists are Trump supporters.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Maybe in this sub, but in general, conspiracy theorists are skeptics at heart. They don&#39;t tend to be worshipful about <em>any</em> celebrities, business leaders, or politicians. A lot of us were awake to the deep corruption in society before Trump stuck his name on his first hotel.</p>

<p>If his supporters admire him, fine. Different people look for different things in leaders. That&#39;s democracy. But get off your knees and at least hold him to some standards.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>After Bernie conceded, the only two major subreddits (over 100k subscribers) where you were still allowed to criticize Hillary were <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> and <a href="/r/The_Donald">/r/The_Donald</a>. This naturally attracted a lot of anti-Hillary (but not necessarily pro-Trump) submissions, comments, and people to these subreddits because there were <em>literally no other big subreddits where you have these discussions</em>. Reddit deliberately isolated the Trump supporters into two subreddits, and now they have the gall to complain that Trump support in <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> is too concentrated.</p>

<p>This is divide and conquer, folks. Corral all of pro-Trump and anti-DNC (again, not the same thing despite what CTR claims) into certain subreddits and then destroy those subreddits.</p>

<p>&quot;They&quot; = Correct the Record shills, <a href="/r/EnoughTrumpSpam">/r/EnoughTrumpSpam</a>, and the <a href="/r/Enough_Sanders_Spam">/r/Enough_Sanders_Spam</a> brigade. They heavily contributed to pushing everyone anti-DNC into a handful of subreddits through moderation abuse, voting brigades, pressuring Reddit admins, and site-wide bullying tactics. And now the same exact crowd is complaining that the subreddits they pushed everyone into are too concentrated with anti-DNC dissent.</p>

<p>Divide and conquer, indeed.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Most conspiracy theorists are trump supporters? A poll of you and your buddies isn&#39;t very accurate. If you honestly think after watching one insider after another stroll into his cabinet that he&#39;s going to do anything contrary to what the deep state intelligence beauracrats (who by the way have no term limits) want him to do you&#39;re almost certainly fooling yourself. </p>

<p>Now I understand if you bought his campaign rhetoric and you still have hope (like those who bought into Obama&#39;s hope), but come the 20th and the following months I&#39;m curious how you&#39;ll react to trump suddenly turning on Russia as has been the plan all along.</p>

<p>Believe me I want nothing more than to watch this NATO buildup in the Balkans and the Baltic states come to an immediate halt but I just don&#39;t see it. Remind me if it happens and you&#39;ll find I have some good things to say about trump but until then...</p>
