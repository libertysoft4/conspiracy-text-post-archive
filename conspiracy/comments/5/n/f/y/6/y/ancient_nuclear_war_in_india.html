    <div class="md"><p>I personally do not subscribe to any religion. My &quot;ridiculous&quot; comment was pointing to someone flying in the air, in a chariot that is on fire. Thats fucking dumb.

<p>Ah, but this is the religion telling us that. See, I believe humans have been around for hundreds of thousand if not millions of years, along side these spirit beings, if you will..</p>

<p>So, that&#39;s why I say what I say. I don&#39;t base it on religious ideas, but only use that as somewhat of a codex, to where to continue looking. I&#39;m a big fan of Graham Hancock&#39;s work.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Robert Oppenheimer the main architect of the US nuclear bomb program made a couple of curious quotes:</p>

<p>After detonating the first atomic bomb Oppenheimer remarked &quot;Now, I am become Death, the destroyer of worlds.&quot;</p>

<ul>
<li>Oppenheimer&#39;s quote is a mirror of a quote from the epic Hindu tale Bhagavad-Gita where goddesses Shiva and Kristna argue with the devil Kali over the fate of universe</li>
</ul>

<p>Some months later Oppenheimer gave another interview about the bomb and said: &quot;It was the first nuclear explosion in Modern Times.&quot; So the man who built the first nuclear bomb believes in the ancient Hindu legends of nuclear war in India.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The rabbit hole is deeper than you think.</p>

<p>Robert Oppenheimer wasn&#39;t just a nobody before he invented the bomb. He came from a wealthy banking family that has financial history going back to the 1500s. They were the bankers of kings and war financiers. There is still an Oppenheimer bank on Wall Street and the City if London called the Oppenheimer funds and the Oppenheimer trusts. This family was a world controller for 100s of years and still is. The Oppenheimer family is of the same pedigree as the Rothschilds. They are the blue bloods. Maybe it would be a little too absurd for a man with the name Rothschild to present the bomb to the world so &quot;they&quot; had one of the lesser known Oppenheimer boys do it. They are all part of the same Atlantian bloodline.</p>

<p>This is all good stuff, upvoted...</p>

<p>One thing though, why is the sphere earth lie so accepted in these conspiracy circles yet there is belief in this population from the Golden Age?  Why is it so acceptable to believe all the BS we are fed about Astronomy/Space?  Space is the ultimate distractor, <em>they</em> are getting everyone to look at the sky and ponder about our insignificance in the universe from our tiny spacerock  hurtling through the galaxy while controlling everyones lives like puppets.</p>

<p>One interesting point about the word &quot;universe&quot; itself is that it actually supports the Golden age theory. The word universe = uni (one) + verse (musical note). The Universe literally means One Note or One musical tone. If you watch the documentary I liked above it talks about how there was a &quot;sound of creation&quot; that conceived the world into being.

<p>The actual shape of the earth is an open discussion still, we will never know until the authorities become free of their shackles and start working for humanity rather their overlords.  Yes space is such vast subject for idiots to get lost in, we haven&#39;t even fully discovered all bounties of the oceans and here we are pondering about and wasting resources on irrelevant space crap.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Years ago when decent programming was still on the history channel I saw the second interview you mention and I can still remember the pause &quot;..In modern times&quot;  gave me. I sat there despite my youth being like: &quot;Uh what? The implication there is that a nuclear exchange occurred in the past... What?&quot;</p>

<p>I haven&#39;t given it much thought lately but would this go in line with a &quot;fall from grace&quot; or &quot;lost apex&quot; kind of theory? Where we (Humanity) were at a much higher level/intellect and after some sort of event we &quot;crashed&quot; or &quot;lost&quot; our greatness, perhaps even consciousness itself was &quot;lost&quot;.</p>

<p>Those among us who survived this event lived in &quot;darkness&quot; or &quot;complete loss&quot;  until a small portion &quot;regained&quot;/became conscious&quot; first and thought themselves divine they then hoarded this knowledge selfishly among their small families, thus becoming the &quot;elites&quot; we know today, still hoarding knowledge from us the masses.</p>

<p>I dunno if that last paragraph made sense but I regret nothing.  </p>

<p>Large piles of skeletons/bodies killed while going about their day, that are MORE radioactive (today!) then the bodies that were recovered from Hiroshima and Nagasaki.</p>

<p>Examples of radiation poisoning in many religious texts, speaking of hair and nails falling out and needing to wash in water, and eve mentions of how special robes had to be worn by the priest cast to carry/examine the Ark of the Covenant, or the person who got to close without the robe (perhaps anti-radiation lead lined protective outfit?) Would incur radiation poisoning.</p>

<p>Very very cool stuff!  Beat thing is many of these details can ONLY be attributed to radiation!</p>
