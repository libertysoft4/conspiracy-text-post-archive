        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>To be a professional athlete is considered a great achievement. They are paid millions of dollars while Joe barely can feed his kids with his job. Yet, Joe keeps tuning in every Sunday because he needs to see his team. Other shit is happening Sunday, Joe has no idea because he&#39;s rewinding the best plays on his DVR.</p>

<p>Is it coincidental that at a young age, those of us that are strong are encouraged to do sports? Is it coincidental that the strong get sucked into the materialistic lifestyle? Once you live on the side of money it is hard to see many problems financially and you basically forget about that stress completely. </p>

<p>Why would the strong be consumed by sports? Well, TPTB are frail pedos... if all the athletes came together then we&#39;d have some strong 6&#39;5&quot;, 300 pound dudes and TPTB would have nothing in terms of man power to stop that. </p>

<p>But they have the military...</p>

<p>Remember Pat Tillman? Shot in the back by friendly fire... coincidental? How would someone not see that huge man-beast?</p>

<p>Tl;DR: Sports are used to distract the strong from a progressive life, and keep the average and weak entertained so they don&#39;t question as much.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Interesting.  I think you are on to something,  though I&#39;m not sure if it&#39;s strong vs weak. I&#39;m not strong, I bowed out of athletics after HS, but I still watch sports for the mental aspect...the gamesmanship. But the idea that sports is used as a distraction I can definitely get behind. Maybe it&#39;s a way to highlight division? Interesting thread homey, thanks for posting </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The NFL, NBA, and MLB are almost certainly working in conjunction with our government.  I have a theory that replay was pushed so heavily as a way to increase ad revenue as well as a way to expose more of the masses to propaganda. Every time there is a replay they go to commercial, every time! Hell espn.com also now joins in on the Russian propaganda. Claiming that the Russians hacked us because they were caught in that doping scandal. Sports is almost definitely a vehicle for our government. George Bush throwing out the first pitch in NY after 9/11 is another connection between propaganda and sports. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>What about brain over brawn? Sure, when it comes down to it, you want an army of strong men, but then again, a gun doesn&#39;t care who is wielding it.</p>

<p>If I had to chose between having Tesla (assuming he was legit, you never know /Conspiracy mirite) or 5 NBA players on my side in a war, I would legitimately chose Tesla.</p>

<p>He can use that big brain of his to come with crazy plans, and at the end of the day, he can still fire a gun just aswell as a bodybuilder.</p>

<p>I do agree that most forms of media entertainment are nothing more than bread and games. I never understood how so many people can be moved by sports, yet at the same time get smacked to death with scandal after scandal at the highest levels of these sports.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>They do, but from what I&#39;ve seen in interview during my life time, intelligence is definitely not a requiredment to be a top athlete. (Why would it be?)</p>

<p>So I still wonder:</p>

<p>An army of 1000 bodybuilders vs an army of 1000 Tesla&#39;s (not the car lul).</p>

<p>By the time the 1000 bodybuilder crushed 900 Tesla&#39;s, the remaining 100 will use their newly created Death Ray to zap their enemies into oblivion.</p>

<p>It&#39;s a bit childish, but I think the essence is true. 100000 Atletes can be swept away with a single atomic bomb. Technology VASTLY outscales human force.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Compelling post but I have one problem. The military is way more successful at brainwashing strong men to directly help achieve the wishes of TPTB.</p>

<p>If anything when done properly sports are a good way to teach work ethic, determination, teamwork, leadership, cooperation which are all the things that TPTB want to destroy in our society. Why do you think there is such a financed push to pussify sports? Is it REALLY about protecting the athletes who chose to play? It&#39;s not like they are dodges like slaves they can walk away.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Young people are encouraged to participate in sports so they don&#39;t become fat and live a healthy lifestyle. Yes, sports is a distraction, just like church, video games or other hobbies. Not everything is a conspiracy. Those athletes are making millions because people watch them and buy their shit, that&#39;s capitalism. The average pro NFL football player, plays for about 3 and will make great money. Then his career in football is probably over. He probably spent most of his money on frivolous things, is addicted to pain killers and probably hasn&#39;t graduated college. I&#39;ve met a number of pro athletes most have never ever heard of and their stories are similar. People should also take occasional breaks from all things conspiracy (or truth, depending on your view) and enjoy our brief time here. When I first got into what most called conspiracy, it was shortly after 9/11, and it consumed me that people know what really happened. My life was work, protests and digging into the awful events, and it was really a depressing time. Now, I still know 9/11 was an inside job, pizzagate seems legit and many other therioes have a lot of truth and I&#39;ll continue to read, protest and dig. But I&#39;m also watching football this weekend, because it&#39;s an escape, from learning the pedophiles are running our government. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s your refuge. But friend, those motherfuckers run sports, just like they run the government. The movies, our books, our whole culture runs on an engine of slavery and debachery. But I get it, I still watch Disney movies.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I like your observations, but I think the outcome here is more of happy serendipity for those in power. I&#39;m thinking of sport in tribal culture, which I doubt would have any of that sort of thinking behind it. People (and my cats) love to play and compete in a non-threatening way, and me and the third cat enjoy watching them without ourselves participating. To me, that suggests a fundamental archetype behind it.</p>
