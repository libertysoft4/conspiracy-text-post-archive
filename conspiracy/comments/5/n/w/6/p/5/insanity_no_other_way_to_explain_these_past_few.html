During the election I discovered that this sub was one of the only places online arguing facts vs opinions. Both sides were expressed with as much data or links as possible to argue their points, and for the most part (as far as I can tell), the mods did an amazing job of keeping the narrative CTR/shill free (thank you, mods)</p>

<p>Anyway, I consider myself pretty well-versed in foreign and US affairs and continue to shake my head in disbelief at the insanity we&#39;re witnessing right now. Take a look at the top threads from the past year. Can anyone recall anything as bat shit crazy (9/11 aside) in the past 15-20 years? </p>

<p>I truly believe in the global awakening and am focusing my energy on opening the eyes of the sheeple. </p>

<p>Thanks to everyone here for helping me see the truth. Keep up the fight, we&#39;re at the tipping point. </p>

There were all sorts of bizarre flooding of conversations online, vote manipulation, the topic strangely missing from places you would expect it under discussion (news, technology).

<p>agreed. once you know the pattern, it&#39;s very easy to recognize. </p>

<p>if anyone is looking for a real easy example, check out anything breaking news regarding russia-- especially as it relates to their war in ukraine. </p>

<p>you&#39;ll see the shills crawling outta the woodwork. once you&#39;ve got the hang of what they&#39;re like, you&#39;ll know that the issue has touched a nerve... and by knowing that, you&#39;ll be a big leap closer to the truth about whatever the issue is.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I am glad you came. I have been lurking for a very long time, in fact, daily, all day long. I post very occasionally, but if I posted every time I wanted to, well, there would be no time in the day. I am awaiting the battle call.</p>

<p>I am so fed up with the globalist narrative, I am so fed up with treachery and evil. It&#39;s time to take this country back.</p>

<p>I remember when the primaries came to my state, dwelling on which power could possibly defeat Hillary. Everything said she would win! Even anonymous though that Trump would be the fourth quarter pipe dream. </p>

<p>I never dreamed of what Trump would become. I never dreamed of a political movement backing him, but the movement largely does not back him because of who he is, but because he draws the line we need him to. </p>

<p>I do not trust any man, and while I will meme and politically slam dunk on bitches for fun, I WILL not stop analyzing Trump and his every move. If he is a traitor to America, then we will take him down, but the important thing to recognize is what you said in your second to last line:</p>

<p>THE GLOBAL AWAKENING</p>

<p>It is happening and I feel that many people are cautiously optimistic about the situation. I am also scared all the time. The globalists have run this country since at least Bill Clinton. Now is our chance to show this fine country, and the world, the power of nationalism and self pride. We should be proud of who we are and we should not tolerate the systematic destruction of ISIS and the previous threat of refugees who will run us down with busses or trucks or shoot our families in the streets. We must take a stand for our lives, our liberty and the pursuit of our happiness.</p>

<p>I believe that Trump has done... a text book job of running a grass roots campaign and with every damn tweet, he reinforces the campaign. So let us stay awake, let us continue to be so focused on truth that none can withstand us. </p>

<p>Thank you for all the work you anons have done. I don&#39;t know a single one of you, your pain, your struggle, the fights that have brought you to this internet haven, but I empathize with you, I understand the brutal anger towards lies and I too will watch like a hawk for the moment we must stand together if need be. Godspeed and God bless. May you all find peace in the light of the truth as we press forward to dismantle the cabal the globalist powers have created.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>The globalists have run this country since at least Bill Clinton. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Well, I would push that back in time a bit. I think we mostly agree that a strange Democratic-Republican alliance of sorts was installed under the aegis of George Bush I. He was involved in Ronald Reagan&#39;s 8 years from 1980-1988. So the foundations of what we have called the Bush-Clinton era go back at least that far. Since that time, a Bush or a Clinton was very prominent:
<em>1980-1988 Bush I VP for Reagan
*1988-1992 Bush I President
*1992-2000 Bill Clinton President
*2001-2008 Bush II President
*2008-2016 Obama 
*</em>2008 Hillary Clinton vs. Obama for Democratic nominee
*<em>2009-2013 Hillary Clinton Sec. of State
*</em>2016 Hillary Clinton runs for President</p>

<p>There is little doubt that all the period between 1980 and 2016 (36 years) has been dominated by these two families. The interesting exercise is to examine which policies the two family dynasties agreed on:
*Qualified support for big business and bankers
*Unqualified support for free trade and high technology
*Aggressive military intervention in the Middle East and non-stop expansion of military industry and technology
*Adherence to a &quot;NATO-Western Alliance&quot; based foreign policy generally hostile to Russia
*Broad new initiatives to monitor and control domestic &quot;threats&quot; which steadily undermine long-held freedoms
*Relatively passive approach to illegal immigration control
*Minimal attention to &quot;Family Values&quot; issues despite a growing voting power
*No response to drug-war and drug-imprisonment social problems
*Shift of all environmental focus from a variety of &quot;damage to environment&quot; issues to one all-encompassing and unsolvable &quot;climate change&quot; issue
*Facilitation of agro-industrial and pharmaceutical chemical industries
*Encouragement of all sorts of consumer debt, especially student loans</p>

<p>The Bush-Clinton agenda hit pushback in 2016. Half of the above policies were hated by the Bernie Sanders supporters, who nearly took the primary. The other half were hated by initially skeptical Trump supporters, who ended up giving the presidency to a long-shot, troubled, unpredictable candidate solely to bring an end to the 36 years of highly consistent political strategy outlined.</p>

<p>Finally, what strikes me about all the post-election freak-out is this: we should all be able to agree that Trump did not win on his credibility, but rather Clinton lost because she could not gain the public&#39;s trust after 40 years of prominent exposure. Now, the &quot;elites&quot; who backed her simply cannot admit that Hillary is the reason Hillary did not win. If she had not been such a divisive candidate at the beginning of the campaign,  including inside her own party, no amount of vaguely suspicious emails could have stopped her from beating the least experienced politician in the country.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>the &quot;narrative shield&quot; is starting to break down. soon we will see that behind the curtain is a wall. </p>

<p>the media&#39;s propaganda machine can&#39;t come to terms within itself and spills much ink throwing accusations at each other. wholesale dismissal of certain publications is encouraged within the media and also by the president, yet there is no consensus, merely gridlock. the public&#39;s capture is lost in the meantime, though confusion prevails rather than &quot;awakening&quot;. </p>

<p>the deep state is at open war with itself and also the elected government; the elected government may be controlled or heavily influenced by a geopolitical enemy and has already discarded the promises it made during the election. journalists openly fear the deep state&#39;s power even while serving their ends; the elected government is on-course to begin formal suppression of the press. the elected government is overtly oligarchic (see: exxon mobile + goldman appointments) and fascistic, yet still has many cheering them on. </p>

<p>the public is simultaneously kept in the dark by all sides while gaining progressively more disparate information which doesn&#39;t pull together into a larger picture. disinformation and shills choke our free discourse. half of the public hates the other half. i don&#39;t believe that this hatred can be reconciled.  </p>

<p>there is a major march on washington planned for the day after the inauguration; it will likely be the high point of many lifetime people&#39;s political involvement, but its possibilities for actual change are unclear. </p>

<p>the voice of freedom is a mere whisper amidst the firestorm. there are no power players who are interested in supporting the public, and the public is too fractured to defend itself. i can&#39;t decide whether system breakdown or system extreme consolidation and empowerment is next. interesting times ahead. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have a chat group of 5 friends I&#39;ve know forever and we talk all day every day.  All of us mainly lean left.  Every single one of us were red pilled this election.  I have gone from thinking conspiracy is a dirty word, to reading about Snowden, 9/11, mockingbird, paperclip, Franklin scandal, dutroux affair, false memory syndrome, tavistock, etc etc.  I&#39;ve been slowly planting seeds with others about the lies being told and I think they are far more receptive to it than you&#39;d think. I really believe the momentum there&#39;s an awakening happening </p>
