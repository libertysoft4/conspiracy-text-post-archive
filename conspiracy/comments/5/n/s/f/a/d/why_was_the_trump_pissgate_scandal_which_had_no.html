After months of being called a shill, or CTR and even a pedo for questioning how pizzagate was handled here, I wanted to see what the supposedly unbiased would do once the shoe was on the other foot.  Well, as I predicted the reactionaries got very reactionary and starting making their own post to correct the record.  They start using the the term &quot;fake news&quot;, even after mocking the term for weeks.  They then labeled the story as fake, which was new move or a move so rare that I had not noticed before.  They then deleted the story all together.   They then offered no proof of an influx of new upvoters.  All while claiming they knew that they were right to delete to the post because they were with the supposed majority here on <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah I saw the GQ article I was under the impression the 2001 date implies that they can&#39;t be talking about the time Trump supposedly had hookers piss on Obama&#39;s bed or whatever. Is the allegation from the &quot;dossier&quot; that the events took place pre or post 2001? </p>

<p>I don&#39;t care who Trump has sex with. I don&#39;t even care if he likes getting pissed on if it&#39;s true. What I do care about is how the MSM chooses to run full speed with extremely dubious claims that even the intelligence agencies can&#39;t verify at all. They have had zero accountability for the repeated character assassinations.</p>

<p>Don&#39;t even get me started on John McCain. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Okay I see your point. I am exaggerating but the fact that they were even talking about the story like it could possibly be true without verifying anything to do with it is absurd. It&#39;s the exact same shit they pulled with the fake sex assault allegations, racism allegations, etc. They KNEW it was BS but chose to talk about it anyway and lead the American people on a wild goose chase.</p>

<p>Elements of it very well could be true. Christopher Steele is a former MI6 agent who blew open the FIFA corruption case, this isn&#39;t some crackpot off the street. Nobody &quot;KNOWS&quot; it&#39;s BS.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>On a slightly related note think about the coverage that grab em by the pussy got versus the video of Hillary passing the fuck out and getting chucked into a van like a side of beef. That shit was ridiculous.</p>

<p>You&#39;re losing me now. A presidential nominee on tape claiming that he sexually assaults women is a much bigger deal than a 69 year old woman fainting. There&#39;s not a shred of credible evidence that Clinton has any major health issues.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>LMAO okay I&#39;m sorry but are you a prude? This sexual assault shit is absolutely absurd. Sexual assault doesn&#39;t involve consent. Going in for a kiss isn&#39;t sexual assault unless the woman refuses. Do you have the famous proof that even the accusers themselves can&#39;t provide. Still waiting on Gloria Allred&#39;s bombshell civil case on the matter. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Heh. Sorry I rustled your jimmies by pointing out what the man literally said on tape.</p>

<p>He said verbatim that he kisses women and grabs them by the pussy without asking them first. And multiple women have come forward saying he did exactly that. </p>

<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/5kcppl/plant_lady_just_dropped_a_nuke/">https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/5kcppl/plant_lady_just_dropped_a_nuke/</a></p>

<p>and</p>

<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/5mar1s/til_ron_paul_has_his_own_show_on_youtube_the_ron/">https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/5mar1s/til_ron_paul_has_his_own_show_on_youtube_the_ron/</a></p>

<p>which were after the algorithm change with plenty of upvotes. Not to mention, once something hits <a href="/r/all">/r/all</a> it&#39;ll get a bunch more votes on it as well (especially considering it&#39;s an anti-trump post).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>When I first saw the &quot;trump allegations&quot; headlines elsewhere my immediate thought was to see if it had been posted here, basically because I knew it wasn&#39;t the typical r/conspiracy narrative (being anti-Trump) and fully expected to see a huge amount of hypocrisy... and whadaya know, I <em>DID</em> see an insane amount of hypocrisy.</p>

<p>...so I upvoted the thread and the comments that pointed out the hypocrisy.</p>

<p>If r/conspiracy was true to it&#39;s cause we would&#39;ve seen the sub as a whole digging through all these juicy new allegations... how far down does the rabbit hole go? But no, we saw lots of people wriggling and squirming and performing Olympic standard mental gymnastics in order to persuade themselves, and others, why we shouldn&#39;t bother exploring this particular conspiracy.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I see what point you&#39;re trying to make but yeah that&#39;s not how PizzaGate is working. I do agree that Pissgate shouldn&#39;t be brushed off but the PizzaGate investigation is way more in depth with more results then you&#39;re playing off.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve been called crazy for months because of PizzaGate but I&#39;m still investigating. If you find truth in and passion in finding truth in PissGate, by all means keep digging and if you stick with it and enough evidence is found then the movement will continue. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think it is viewed through that lens for a good reason. The people participate in spirit cooking and do things that have occult references like saying &quot;sacrifice a chicken to moloch&quot; (some say it was joke but i don&#39;t think so). They also talk in code sometimes like &quot; a handkerchief with a pizza related map&quot;. John Podestas associate, James Alefantis also has a lot of questionable things on his instgram relating to murder, infants, and kids. </p>

<p>I agree, all of it is circumstantial at best but suspicious at the least. I am glad there are people behind the scenes looking for verifiable evidence. I don&#39;t think me, you, or anyone can categorically say that pizzagate is true or false. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think the biggest difference is there is evidence of massive pedophilia rings. That isn&#39;t even a conspiracy theory, its a conspiracy fact. They exist. The idea that pedophiles would promote other pedophiles in office also makes a ton of sense, for blackmail and control purposes. So while there isn&#39;t a lot of &quot;tangible evidence&quot; regarding Pizzagate, pandora&#39;s box just keeps getting bigger and bigger the more people investigate it. Whereas Pissgate just doesn&#39;t really make any logical sense. Trump defended himself perfectly, he is a public figure, he knows he is being watched, he knows his behavior is constantly being scrutinized. Why would he travel to a foreign country and then let his guard down and hire prostitutes to piss on a bed that Obama had slept on? Ppl who say Trump is a moron, he hates Obama! Why wouldn&#39;t he do this? Are missing the point here. This behavior literally doesn&#39;t accomplish anything. I&#39;m not saying its impossible that Trump could be a pervert, I&#39;m just saying that by and large he is incredible pragmatic. If you have a second source corroborating Pissgate, I&#39;d love to see it. I am all about breaking down assumptions and questioning everything, as is 90% of the ppl on this sub.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The thread is about pissgate. Hence my response to those allegations. The accusation you are referring to is based on the assumption that trump paid the Russians to hack the dnc and leak the documents to Wikileaks. This hasn&#39;t been proven, and the narrative is being peddled by the intelligence community which should naturally bring suspicion. I am not arguing that trump isn&#39;t corrupt. I&#39;ve known he was from day 1. And if there is a quid pro quo that&#39;s obviously not ok, but it seems pretty much standard operating procedure for republicans and democrats, why would we expect any different with trump? However, It&#39;s not foolish to think that instigating war with Russia is a bad idea. It&#39;s a lesser of two evils to create friendly relations with Russia, lest we want another Cold War and nuclear threat on our hands. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The pissing and the quid pro quo are all in the same opposition Buzzfeed published. You&#39;re trying to dismiss or separate it by calling it Pissgate and make it sound outlandish. We know what Russia is trying to do. Nuclear war is not the only alternative to electing the prefferred candidate of Putin. If any of the non pissing stuff is true it&#39;s worse than what Nixon resigned for. At the end of the day, we know for sure a couple of scary things, whether or not any of the buzzfeed dump is true. We know Russia wants what&#39;s in this book and they think Trump being President helps them get there.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think the link to this book was posted here a little while ago. I read the summary and it was very compelling and a lot of what it said rings very similar to what is going on here in the USA. Trump very well could be a puppet of the Kremlin, and I have no doubt that thousands of citizen journalists, investigators and other journalists will continue to dig to find the truth. Trumps cabinet picks are enough to cause concern and speculation, but we have nothing yet to really tie him down to any wrongdoing. </p>

<p>If we look at what proof we have right now, a dossier filled with factual errors written by a British intelligence agent, funded specifically by anti-Trump politicians, the veracity of this document can already be called into question, by this fact alone. There is a significant difference between a sketchy document written for political purposes, leaked by the CIA who has been known to spread disinformation to the public, and a set of emails written by elected officials themselves (aka dnc leaks) that have been verified as real. It&#39;s going to be difficult to compel a bunch of conspiracy nerds to start investigating a CIA and MSM pushed rhetoric that russia hacked our elections, and even less motivating when that hack resulted in tangible proof of wrong doings by the dnc. I am not referring to the pedo ring, but all of the other corrupt ass shit they were doing which is more along the lines with the accusations against trump, bribes, foreign kick backs, pay to play, etc. Now I firmly believe that Trump and Hillary are of the same cloth, two sides of the same coin. Both are corrupt as fuck, but I can&#39;t superimpose my personal beliefs onto the evidence. This dossier doesn&#39;t even compare as evidence to the troves and troves of actual emails from dnc personnel. If we get access to trumps emails and it proves illegal behavior, many here will be there pouring through the documents just as they poured through the podesta emails. </p>

<p>To further clarify, I am a former democrat. I voted obama in 08 and 12. Obama was the first president I ever voted for. I hated trump, I thought he was a corrupt, narcissistic, who is going to use the presidency as a 4 year infomercial for his business (the LL bean tweet, his daughters plug for her jewelry,  were beyond repugnant). And yet, I still believe that some of what pizzagate has uncovered could be true. James Alefantis, his friends, and the podestas reactions to these accusations, the medias blatent denial of it, even when they are quick to jump into a very suspect CIA leaked document, is a big reason so many alarm bells in the conspiracy community are going off. Your not going to be able to peg me as some trump supporter and say that that is what is clouding my judgement, it&#39;s not. I&#39;m allowed to hate trump and Hillary equally.</p>

The narrative that the religious right and the pro business centrists (the worst from each side) will push the same policy is either naive or disingenuous. You&#39;re simply a dumb person if you think they&#39;re all the same. The SCOTUS appointments alone show stark differences that change real life in this country. Trump wants another Scalia, and you&#39;re basically saying the dems do too or your argument falls apart when you realize the stark contrast of the kind of nominee it would actually be. This is not to mention putting the EPA in the hands of someone who sued them and copy pasted oil lobby policy as his own work. Seriously, get the fuck out of here with your brainless argument.</p>

Where do you come off like your opinion and perspective is more valid than mine? Last I checked that&#39;s not what this sub is about, get the fuck over it, you only speak for yourself, don&#39;t act like you speak for others. I am neither naive nor disingenuous, what is naive to me is assuming that Trump, is going to be somehow any different than Bush Sr, Clinton, Bush Jr and Obama. When you start to look at the big picture, who is the president doesn&#39;t actually change all that much. Yes some policies do some good for people, I&#39;m not arguing that they don&#39;t, and all presidents and congress have put out some policies that do affect us in a good way and a bad way. When policy affects us in a bad way that&#39;s when we have to protest it. But really how does a conservative replacing Scalia have that much effect on our lives? Scalia was incredibly conservative, and all of or civil liberties weren&#39;t stripped away when he was on the court. There has to be a compelling case against abortion that makes it completely through the lower courts. That hasn&#39;t happened since the 1960s with roe v wade, how the fuck is trump somehow going to magically overturn that? Trump being president just means that the elite get to continue to screw over the people and the government continues to commit fraud and passes policy bandaids and temporary fixes with our tax dollars. Your making this partisan when I&#39;m discussing politics free of that distraction. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;d argue the opposite, actually.
It seems impossible to me that normal people would ever turn a blind eye to a conspiracy of pedophiles for whatever reason. They&#39;d be turned in by anyone, no matter how fucked up their politics are.
We had a couple of examples of this sort of conspiracy in Australia, one in Sydney in the 80&#39;s where the perverts were cooking meth for some crooked cops.
Another where an MP (congressman) was banging young boys in his parliament office.  In both cases a s soon as someone non-perverted knew about it, they reported it, even though it harmed their position/political party.
I can&#39;t believe that everyone in the Democrats who &quot;knows&quot; about the pro ring wouldn&#39;t put reporting it over party political interests.
That doesn&#39;t ring true for me.
On the other hand, hearing about Donald Trump hiring prostitutes while on a trip to Russia does seem in keeping with everything we know about his personal life, conduct, etc</p>

<p>Not trying to start something- I think Trump is likely to be no better or worse than other presidents. But the relative believability of the two stories are Pissgate&gt;Pizzagate</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Take a look at my latest response to coltninja above. I&#39;m too lazy to type it all out again. For all I know pizzagate could be a flaming pile of crap, but there is evidence to suggest that people in power have ways to manipulate law enforcement and evade persecution. Do a little research on The Finders and The Franklin Coverup, I also read about a pedo ring in your neck of the woods involving Nicole Kidmans father. He fled the country after the allegations and died. It&#39;s also distinctly possible that the police in Australia are far less corrupt than those in America, given the numerous (17+ intelligence agencies we have). I am not saying that there aren&#39;t good cops and CIA and FBI, but there are also bad ones who work for the men in power who will cover this up. </p>

<p>For all we know Trump could be a perverted, corrupt Russian puppet. I definitely believe he is at least a perverted womanizer and corrupt, as I have seen evidence from his very behavior that prove such claims. However this dossier is super suspect, contains factual errors, was written by an ex British spy, and leaked by the CIA, it can&#39;t even be compared as evidence to the actual dnc emails, which are real. Outside of pizzagate those emails prove corruption, but the untouchable elites will never be tried for it. Again, I&#39;m still on the fence about pizzagate, but the evidence is still stronger than this sketch dossier. The reactions of james alefantis, his friends and the podestas, and msm blatant cover up , are all super sketch and flame the fires that something is really there. </p>

More that the contents are more believable without looking at the respective facts.</p>

<p>Just another. Thing- Nicole Kidman&#39;s dad was a respected psychiatrist and recipient of the Order of Australia. The woman who accused him of pedophilia also reported being abused by three prime ministers, the Nazis and satanists....

    <div class="md"><p>Additionally everyone was very clear in reporting that the dossier was unsubstantiated.</p>

<p>The news element of the story over time was: </p>

<p>the POTUS and PEOTUS were briefed on it</p>

<p>buzzfeed released it and then that Trump reacted poorly</p>

<p>Other intelligence agencies and our own intelligence sources confirm the character of the author</p>

<p>Certain parts of the dossier are consistent or inconsistent with XYZ.</p>

<p>And various other aspects.</p>

<p>The MSM story was never that the dossier was true.</p>

<p>Running with &quot;stories with no evidence&quot; is dangerous when it&#39;s in support of powerful people.  When it&#39;s against powerful people, it&#39;s dangerous.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The MSM as a whole didn&#39;t. They ran the story about the briefing to the POTUS and Trump only initially and were openly critical of buzz feed for releasing it when they did. </p>

<p>Once buzz feed had released it, what did you expect the rest to do? Ignore it? They provided context and explain exactly what was verified (which was the stories about McCain and Paul Manafort etc) and what wasn&#39;t verified (pissgate) with many going as far as not mentioning the publicly available details to preserve their integrity because they think the leak was poor practice. </p>

<p>Given what they had to work with and given the leak, I don&#39;t think they did a bad job realistically.</p>

We could argue that the sub was brigaded, but I haven&#39;t seen anyone making that argument show anywhere in another sub with a high enough population where <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> was linked. That sort of incendiary accusation is EXACTLY what should evoke that sort of response in this forums.</p>

<p>When the mods deleted the Buzzfeed post, within minutes they stickied a 2 second gif of Biden from the Congressional swearing in ceremony that people are claiming is evidence he is a pedo with absolutely no content and a title something along the lines of &quot;Saw a Biden gif was trending on the front page and thought we needed one here.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The dossier itself wasn&#39;t exactly made up by Buzzfeed, but put together by a private company as opposition research, by an ex MI6 agent. Obama was briefed on the contents of the dossier, and McCain brought the dossier to the FBI as well. However, the contents within the dossier were not all verified. I would argue that it isn&#39;t fake news because it was important enough to be used as material within a governing agency. However, the fact that the contents within the dossier might not all be true is why some people are criticising Buzzfeed for releasing it.</p>

<p>While I&#39;m skeptical of all the contents within the dossier as well, I don&#39;t believe it&#39;s the mods job to delete posts like this, we should be able to make up our own minds about it. Not to mention the mods here don&#39;t seem to ever delete anti-clinton or pro-trump stuff that come from spambots and other things that are demonstrably inarguably false.</p>

<p>And let&#39;s be honest, if this leaked dossier contained anti-Clinton information, this subreddit along with the_donald would be claiming all the information is real, and if a similar thread was deleted off <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a> these subreddits would have been outraged by it. Anyone saying that the dossier contained fake information would be called a shill and the MSM would be trying to censor the dossier by claiming the contents were unverified.</p>

<p>As for raiding: the dossier news was one of the largest conspiracies for months and reached <a href="/r/all">/r/all</a> so it seems pretty natural. </p>

<p>Yes. And in my view, it aligns perfectly with what I&#39;ve been saying. </p>

<p>When we first tangled <em>because you don&#39;t believe in a word I used</em> you made up your mind. And that&#39;s fine: you can be as closed off to discussion as you want.

<p>It&#39;s not as simple as Trump said it was &#39;Fake News&#39; so r/conspiracy ignores it, MSM said its &quot;Fake News&#39; so <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> pursues it. I think the biggest difference is that there is actual evidence of massive global pedophilia rings. That isn&#39;t even a conspiracy theory, its a conspiracy fact. They exist. The idea that pedophiles would promote other pedophiles in office also makes a ton of sense, for blackmail and control purposes. So while there isn&#39;t a lot of &quot;tangible evidence&quot; regarding Pizzagate, pandora&#39;s box just keeps getting bigger and bigger the more people investigate it. Not to mention the ppl accused are acting super sketchy in rxn to it. 
Whereas Pissgate just doesn&#39;t really make any logical sense. Trump defended himself perfectly, he is a public figure, he knows he is being watched, he knows his behavior is constantly being scrutinized. Why would he travel to a foreign country and then let his guard down and hire prostitutes to piss on a bed that Obama had slept on? Ppl who say &quot;Trump is a moron, he hates Obama, why wouldn&#39;t he do this?&quot; Are missing the point here. This behavior literally doesn&#39;t accomplish anything. I&#39;m not saying its impossible that Trump could be a pervert, he&#39;s said a lot of perverted, sexist and weird things. It&#39;s not a conspiracy that he is a womanizer, that&#39;s a wide open blatant fact. I&#39;m just saying that by and large he is incredible pragmatic.</p>

<p>Use your brain and read between the lines. It has been widely circulated in the media and among government for several months, and none of it has been able to be substantiated even though Republicans, Democrats, and the media have been digging into this. All have been trying to take down Trump. If this has been around for quite some time and nothing has come of it, guess what? It&#39;s not real.

    <div class="md"><p>Then pick apart the flimsy parts of specific assertions and point them out. Point out flaws in people&#39;s arguments / logic. </p>

<p>But instead, you make blanket statements about the theory itself, like &quot;there&#39;s nothing compelling about pizzagate&quot; (IDK what that&#39;s suppose to even mean).</p>

<p>Conspiracies about the elites having underground sex magick rituals have been circulating for 30+ years. These same <em>conspiracies</em> were floating around about the Catholic Church too and yet, they&#39;ve been proven. Same thing happened in the UK and before that, there were many like yourself who fought hard to disregard the research. There&#39;s even &quot;circumstantial evidence* that similar things happened in Hitler&#39;s deep inner circle in their search for Vril / orgone energy as well. So these ideas, at least on a conspiracy board, aren&#39;t that far of a stretch. Now that there&#39;s some eerie shit floating around and coded words in emails, symbols, and a strange connection between a pizza place, neighboring buildings, and some of the most powerful people in DC / the world, some boarderline satanic / magick mentions in emails (m<del>oloc</del>h, spirit cooking / Abramovic, and a human trafficker being pardoned / explicitly mentioned multiple times in the emails - it&#39;s natural that people on conspiracy boards are trying to connect dots, difficult or even impossible as it may be.</p>

<p>So if you really care, keep people honest, but don&#39;t make blanket statements over and over again about &quot;those kooks who are ruining this sub with their constant digging at something fake!&quot; there&#39;s a lot of <em>reason</em> behind why they&#39;re interested, and it&#39;s not simply delusion. </p>

At the very least they can ruin them financially or get them in trouble with the IRS (tax law is so crazy confusing anyone could be gone after).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks for informing me on proof... do you know what resonable doubt is? If a guy posts a photo of a crystal and tags it #molly, molly is street name for mdma, you might not be sure if he means the drug or some inside joke but if the same guy keeps posting stuff like that, you can guess with pretty good accuracy that he is AT LEAST a drug user.</p>

<p>The problem is people dont want to believe there is a possibility some famose people and politicians are pedophiles. Human and organ traficing is a $50 billion dollar industry, thats five times more than prostitution.</p>

<p>If you are sent here by someone to troll and attack users, tell your boss he can buy my silence cheaply because i am tight on money.</p>

<p>He fled because his name leaked and he&#39;s in danger.  One of the claims in the dossier was that Carter Page allegedly met with the head of Rosnet (Russia&#39;s state-owned oil company) who offered Trump a 19% privatized stake Rosnet (worth $11 Billion) if he were elected President and ended sanctions against Russia. </p>

<p>Well, on <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-12-07/glencore-qatar-fund-buy-russia-s-rosneft-stake-for-11-billion">December 7th, Rosnet privatized 19.5% of Rosnet</a>, in the process creating a shell company in the Caymans called QHG Cayman.  Also, the chief of staff for the head of Rosnet, who might&#39;ve been Steele&#39;s source on the meeting, <a href="https://themoscowtimes.com/news/top-rosneft-exec-found-dead-in-moscow-56649">was found dead in the back of his company car.</a> </p>

    <div class="md"><p>How about we do this thing of &quot;objective&quot; contemplation??</p>

<p>On the one hand we have a known, established MI6 analyst bringing forth allegations.  This is followed with the US intel leadership providing material establishing the claims validity.</p>

<p>On the other hand we have various vigilantes stalking a business to &quot;find&quot; nefarious details.  Such as dubious videos of &quot;underground tunnels&quot; which &quot;prove&quot; ... I don&#39;t know what, but something to those who make the leap of faith to &quot;believe&quot; the claims.</p>

<p>This shown how little either the mass-media consumer sheeple or the self styled &quot;skeptical&quot; sheeple of alt-media are able to understand or assimilate the technical details of what they read/hear and find even harder to have a &quot;I don&#39;t like that truth, but will accept it&quot; perception.</p>

<p>Instead, both these groups are easily led by the narrative which most appeals to them.</p>

<p>The fundamental problem, which has not yet been addressed in the widespread cluster fuck of &quot;fake news&quot; is that the Establishment and it&#39;s Democratic Process is subordinate to an entrenched, archaic and misguided notion of &quot;State Secret.&quot;</p>

<p>It&#39;s no surprise that the voting masses (whether &quot;sheeple&quot;, &quot;skeptic&quot;, &quot;self-aware&quot; or kazoo blowing yokel) have no trust in anything &quot;Establishment&quot;, have a deep desire to over throw the current system, and are willing to trust any half-baked, obviously wrong and bigoted claims made by whomever this group perceives as being &quot;outside&quot; the &quot;system&quot; ... falsely believing that &quot;an outsider&quot; can bring about &quot;change.&quot;</p>

<p>The list of populist demagogues is long through history (as is the havoc wrought by them), and extremely difficult to gain-say until long after the tides of History have flushed the flotsam of their Bullshit out of the popular zeitgeist.</p>

<p>No, I was offering to give undeniable proof that she was working with them and giving wonderfully supportive speeches to them, promising to help them out, during the campaign.  So with her we have confirmation of her ties to GS.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Why are you so OK with Trumps love of GS?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Because in his cabinets case, everybody who has a tie to GS severed those ties years before the 2016 campaign, competed with them, and basically acted like a normal financial manager - so definitively not a love of GS, but rather people who have moved beyond GS.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Oh yea Mnuchin was a member of Skull and Bones while at Yale. Is that fine with you?</p>

<p>I&#39;m missing the Skull &amp; Bones reference there.  Are you saying he was S&amp;B just because he went to Yale?</p>

<blockquote>

<p>SFM was GS company that he worked for briefly.  I&#39;ve asked for a source to the claims that GS was a partner at Dune or IndyMac/Onewest.  Do you have a source on that?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Remember how Obama appointed Tom Wheeler to the FCC and everybody flipped out about how he was telecom shill?  He ended up doing a lot of good and making some awesome anti-corporate decisions.</p>

<p>GS is huge.  So huge that they have become &quot;too big to care&quot;, which is the problem with GS. Also so huge that almost anybody who goes into a wall street career goes through them at some point.  You&#39;re going to be hard pressed to find someone who is qualified for something like Treasury Sec that hasn&#39;t worked with them at some point.  Bannon, for example, never rose high enough or stayed long enough to be anyone of consequence in the decision making levels of GS.  The GS people I&#39;m aware of are people who <em>left</em> GS to do their own thing.  In the case of Mnuchin, starting his own business directly competing for customer dollars.</p>

<p>Mnuchin is probably the most questionable that I&#39;m aware of, rising to a damn high position.  But seems to have hit a &quot;fuck this I&#39;m out&quot; point.</p>

<p>If he turns out to be a Wheeler type, wonderful.</p>

<p>The Skull&amp;Bones thing has been noted though.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Here are the facts on that (not my research).</p>

<p>First off, we need some context.</p>

<p>Pizzagate investigators cite <a href="http://harvardhrj.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/King.pdf">this documen</a>t as proof that &quot;One of the first things the Clintons did when they took over the scene in Haiti was to have Bill get Laura off the hook.&quot;</p>

<p>But it&#39;s not true according to their own link. The linked document says:</p>

<p>Clinton brokered the release of all the missionaries, except for the group leader, Laura Silsby.</p>

<p>Interesting non-essential side note, if you look at this <a href="https://twitter.com/wikileaks/status/794247777756860417">shameful, monumentally embarrassing tweet</a> from Wikileaks where they link to an early pizzagate thread on the_youknowwho, you can see the original formulation was that &quot;One of the first things Hillary did when she took over the scene in Haiti was get Laura Silsby off the hook...&quot; This has been edited to say &quot;the Clintons&quot; instead of &quot;Hillary&quot; because the linked 46-page document doesn&#39;t even mention Hillary&#39;s name. And besides, &quot;the Clintons took over the scene?&quot; The outcome for Silsby was determined by a trial with a judge and lawyers and testimony from the parents of the &quot;orphans&quot; and all kinds of neat non-Clinton-y stuff.</p>

<p>So what happened to Silby?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Despite Silsby’s stated intent to take the children over the border to an unauthorized orphanage and her connections to human traffickers such as Torres-Puello, the courts eventually dropped the kidnapping and criminal association charges against her. Silsby was instead convicted under the additional charge of organizing illegal travel, sentenced to time served (3 months and 8 days), and released on May 17, 2010. In the end, her sentence was based on the least polemic charge against her. The pressing issue—whether Silsby intended to deliver the children into trafficking rings or grey adoption markets—was not addressed or resolved.</p>

<p>Rather than turning on Silsby’s actions, the decision in her case appeared to turn on the actions of the parents. Judge Bernard Saint-Vil explained that his decision was based on the Haitian parents’ testimony that they had “[given] their kids away voluntarily.” Similarly, defense lawyer Jorge Puello stated that the missionaries “willingly accepted kids they knew were not orphans because the parents said they would starve otherwise.” Another trial attorney for the missionaries, Aviol Fleurant, argued that “[t]he parents’ testimony means no law was broken and ‘we can’t talk any more about trafficking of human beings.’”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>More bombshells about the people who were &quot;trafficking in Haitian orphans,&quot; from the same document. Pizzagate investigators will never highlight or mention this:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The Americans denied any wrongdoing and said they had been trying to help children left orphaned and destitute by the Haitian earthquake. They said Puello had approached their relatives and church, offering his help. It turned out that the children who were with the U.S. missionaries had living parents, many of whom testified they had voluntarily handed their offspring to the Americans in the hope they would be given an education and a better life.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Pizzagate theorists will point to a lawyer Torres to try to make Silsby and crew look worse, but just read this <a href="https://www.ice.gov/news/releases/fugitive-who-posed-lawyer-following-haitian-earthquake-sentenced-3-years-federal">excerpt from an ICE News Release</a> to put it all into context:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In early 2010, Torres surfaced in the Dominican Republic posing as a lawyer representing American church workers detained in Haiti in the wake of the earthquake in that country. Torres convinced a church that he was Jorge Torres Puello, an international lawyer and president of &quot;Puello Consulting&quot; in the Dominican Republic.</p>

<p>Torres obtained a monetary retainer from the families of the detained missionaries and began representing himself to the Haitian court and international media as the attorney/spokesman for them. However, U.S. authorities recognized him as Jorge Torres when media reports showed images of the &quot;alleged&quot; lawyer wearing a suit and carrying a brief case.</p>

<p>An extradition package was prepared and sent to representatives in the Dominican Republic. Torres was arrested, detained and extradited to the United States to face the 2003 alien smuggling charges in Vermont. He pleaded guilty to the charges.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>To sum up this Torres business, the dude faked his identity, offered his services (as in HE approached THEM), bamboozled the missionaries, pretended to be their lawyer until he got extradited.</p>

<p>So Bill Clinton was asked to go in and straighten this business out. Hillary Clinton emailed someone for details about the situation. There are so many leaps that have to be made here to get to satanic-pedo-ritual-sex-slavery ring it&#39;s not even funny.</p>

<p>And so, after all this, Pizzagate investigators go berserk over this <a href="https://wikileaks.org/clinton-emails/emailid/3741">this email</a> &quot;where they are literally pricing how much it costs to transport children&quot; but it&#39;s just a synopsis of a fucking charity organization. Nothing more, nothing less.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Silsby got a sentence based on the technical letter of the law but willingly accepting a fee for giving your children (or any person) away is trafficking/slavery and endangerment. This allows well connected political persons (Clintons) who know how it works, to actively maneuver around it. Silsby was taking them to an <em>unauthorized</em> orphanage. If this were legit, this wouldn&#39;t have been the case. It also doesn&#39;t explain for the parents who were outraged when this happened. Not every testimony was that of &quot;we willingly gave away our child&quot;.   </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Clinton brokered the release of all the missionaries, except for the group leader, Laura Silsby.  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Perhaps they tried but were, in fact, unsuccessful (perhaps because local people were outraged that they just tried to steal/traffick 33 children and weren&#39;t going to let this beezy get off the hook) which would explain the quote you listed before this and why they weren&#39;t able to get her charges dropped. Also, if someone you are highly connected to suddenly has some crazy charges against them (murder, trafficking, rape) it&#39;s amazing how quickly friends/acquaintances and the like disappear. It&#39;s called distancing yourself for fear of association and typically the people with the most to hide, distance themselves the furthest. That would explain why there is zero mention of Hillary in the report and explicitly getting everyone involved released <em>except</em> her furthers my belief that it&#39;s because they were tied so closely together.  </p>

<p>Perhaps Torres was the middle man so they kept their hands clean. He approaches the families, makes a financial offer families can&#39;t refuse, moves the kids, delivers them to Silsby, and then collects his money.  </p>

<p>The smartest thing to do when committing a crime is to hide in plain sight. No offender involved in Pizzagate is going to walk up to someone (outside the inner circles) and say &quot;I would like 1 child please. I&#39;m going to take them home and rape, torture, and drug them&quot;. Those expecting to find that type of &quot;smoking gun&quot; are wasting their precious time. For a lot of the elite, the higher you get in society, the more it becomes about the subtlety of something. I.e. Hidden in plain sight.  </p>

<p>from what Gadfly posted. Doesnt seem like a very legitimate accusation now does it? </p>

<p>If the main piece of evidence is that the clintons may have tried doing something (of which there is no evidence of) but didnt end up doing it (of which there is evidence of) then you are effectively claiming that the clintons are culpable for this for the sole reason that they didn&#39;t do it.</p>

<p>The lawyer Hillary used to help absolve Laura also was a convicted child trafficker, you just can&#39;t make this stuff up. </p>

<p>So basically, a woman who served time for trafficking kids in Haiti now sits on the board of a company that serves as the backbone for many local authorities when they want to issue Amber Alerts. </p>

<p>WikiLeaks also retweeted this story confirming it&#39;s truth and supported with emails to and from Hillary: <a href="https://twitter.com/wikileaks/status/794247777756860417">https://twitter.com/wikileaks/status/794247777756860417</a> </p>

<p>WikiLeaks then confirmed Hillary has a LONG history with convicted child trafficker and kidnapper Laura Silsby, and Huma Abedin (vice chairwoman of Hillary&#39;s 2016 presidential campaign) has been forwarding emails about Laura Silsby&#39;s non government organization to Hillary for years. </p>

<p>Laura Silsby&#39;s NGO was The New Life Children&#39;s Refuge, the same group that was busted by Haitian authorities trying to traffic kids:</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Life_Children%27s_Refuge_case">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Life_Children%27s_Refuge_case</a></p>

<p>And the video below is about a bunch of Haitians protesting the evils of the Clintons, and the man protesting in the video mentions how the Clintons have exploited Haiti&#39;s resources for themselves, and even specifically mentions people in Haiti are afraid to go out at night because of  fear of kidnapping. (4:48 in the video)</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4PeO0SfCw5s&amp;amp;list=PLeAhFbYkBiH1sLiFUnWChhofsYQk7Mc9M&amp;amp;index=66">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4PeO0SfCw5s&amp;amp;list=PLeAhFbYkBiH1sLiFUnWChhofsYQk7Mc9M&amp;amp;index=66</a></p>

<p>At around the 2:00 mark he even mentions Tony Rodham (Hillary&#39;s brother) is now in charge of gold mines in Haiti and sits on the gold mine&#39;s board of directors. </p>

<p>Many people are talking about this story, continue to spread the word!! We need justice for these
 crimes, and the Clintons should be in prison. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Why do these lies about no evidence keep showing up in what&#39;s supposed to be an apolitical skeptic sub? Evidence /= Proof. And I&#39;d say intelligence from the operative who exposed FIFA is definitely evidence. Even hearsay is evidence.</p>

<p>Why are you trying to convince a conspiracy sub it was debunked? How about you let us discuss, debunk, and decide for ourselves?</p>

<p>Why are you suppressing one conspiracy theory to push another one? They are not mutually exclusive. You can believe in both, one or the other, or neither. The point is this is supposed to be a place to have all those discussions, not force your own narrative.</p>

<p>Why are you delegitimizing an entire packet of juicy conspiracy info by labelling it &quot;Pissgate&quot;. Nobody cares about the piss, we care about the Siberian Candidate stuff. The fact that no discussions of it exist on the front page of r/conspiracy and the big thread about it was removed is very telling.</p>

<p>The most telling thing is you&#39;re pushing an opinion that Pizzagate is being suppressed, when the #1 top post on this sub right now is pro-Pizzagate. Do people here not recognize this bullshit for what it is anymore?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>First of all, I hardly ever post in r/politics.  I might check it out to see what sort of shit they are cooking up over there, but to say that I brigade anything is childish.  I&#39;m willing to give Trump as much of a chance as anyone, but I will be highly critical of him because he has shown that he doesn&#39;t give a damn about speaking the truth.  I have never in my life seen a man take every position there is to take on a subject and not have his political career put in jeopardy.   </p>

<p>The fact that so many can blindly follow him without questioning his motives or background is highly alarming to me.  Him being held in low regard is nothing new either.  He has been a public figure since the 80s and many people have had things to say about him that don&#39;t exactly paint him as a shining knight.</p>

<p>Also, enlighten me.  What news outlets have debunked this?  I&#39;m looking and I can not find a single reputable source that does. </p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>This is what I started doing about a year ago (except subbing Clinton in), and it gave me a lot of much-needed perspective.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is what I started doing after the 2008 election. I had only voted once before, in 2004 (as I turned 18 in 2004), and always leaned more conservative, so I wasn&#39;t exactly jumping for joy when Obama first won.</p>

<p>But holy shit, the instant backlash and unabashed racism I started seeing from my peers made me stop in my tracks. I started recognizing the very same smear tactics, fear-mongering, and outright lying that the right criticized the left for utilizing during Bush years being employed by those same people attacking Obama, and they were completely shameless in it, too. They didn&#39;t have given a single shit that they were acting like hypocrites, and happily perpetuated and passed along every outrageous lie they came across about Obama.</p>

<p>Only once I started replacing &quot;Obama&quot; with &quot;Bush&quot; in their absurd accusations, and throwing them back in their faces, did some of them see the point I was trying to make: that they were happily allowing themselves to be manipulated through the use of confirmation bias. </p>

<p>But those people were few and far between, and the resulting insanity that gripped the GOP during Obama&#39;s administration only reaffirmed my decision to register as an independent at 17. This isn&#39;t an endorsement of the democratic party, either, as both sides have batshit crazy hardliners, but as of now, the right is winning whatever terrible game they&#39;re playing, and the results are terrifying.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t know where I read it (back then I wasn&#39;t on Reddit or Digg, even), but I&#39;ll be forever grateful to whoever first introduced me to the concept of confirmation bias. After reading up on it, I immediately recognized so many instances in that four year time period (between first being able to vote and starting to distance myself from the GOP) where I never thought to search out sources, let alone even question the intended or subconscious bias behind what I was being told by the people whose opinions I valued. But back in late 2008, after Obama won, and I watched the party I had loudly and proudly attached myself to with Bush, lose its absolute fucking mind over what essentially boiled down to having their decorated war vet with a long history in Washington lose out to a black democrat who was only a junior senator was the straw that broke the camel&#39;s back for plenty of Republicans, including most of my close friends and family.</p>

<p>Thankfully, though, a lot of my current ideologies were shaped (and, just as importantly, continue to be shaped) by allowing myself to push past that (admittedly powerful) initial urge to reject whatever goes against my narrative, and instead look past the news articles, bloggers, and talking heads who are telling me what they know I want to hear, and instead look for the overall &quot;us versus them&quot; theme between to the two sides. While they&#39;ll never align with each other, it&#39;s incredibly easy to compile all articles and talking points on each side of the aisle and get an almost-blatant impression of what and how we&#39;re being told to feel; one from the liberal side, one from the conservative side, and each full of just as many truths as it they are crammed with as much bullshit as they can get away with (which, in this last election cycle, was a metric fuckton).  </p>

<p>To avoid the usual circlejerk (and another unnecessarily long comment), I&#39;ll try to do something I need to do more often, especially on Reddit, which is remind myself of this very simple truth: <strong>I am, and always will be, swayed by confirmation bias</strong>, even in the smallest of ways. Everyone is, to a certain extent, and while I like to believe I do my best to police and catch a runaway thought before it takes root, it doesn&#39;t always work, and this last election cycle has been a true test. I despise everything about Trump and his policies, so not allowing my gut reactions to immediately determine every article that paints him in a bad light as true has been a more of a challenge than I would like to admit, especially when I see myself falling for the very same emotional traps I spent eight years admonishing my conservative friends for falling into. </p>

<p>I avoided the default politics subreddit like the plague (as just about anyone really should), but, ironically, just as quickly and happily, subbed to EnjoughTrumpSpam knowing full well what it was being used for. I think, there, though, I can (possibly poorly) justify it in the sense that ETS isn&#39;t in any way trying to hide its bias, in the same that T_D users justify its bias by claiming the exact same thing. Apart from that, though, having to wade through the not-always-obvious clickbait to get to the real sources isn&#39;t always as easy as letting righteous indignation take over by venting about him on Facebook, simply &quot;doing my (weak-ass) part&quot; by sharing a link and moving on. However, as I lament the fact so many of my intelligent friends on both sides of the political divide quickly spread any link to what could be hot garbage so long as it proves them right and the other side wrong, I try to hold off on the Facebook rants until a story has at least been verified true or false. Plus, as was pointed out above, the simple technique of substituting one figure for their political opposite to see if your emotional reaction to that changes at all is a fantastic indicator of how easily you&#39;re swayed by confirmation bias. </p>

<p>Trump supporters have rightfully pointed out the left&#39;s unwillingness to even acknowledge a clear, biased narrative being pushed out hourly by certain companies, and by adding the self-same argument I have used so extensively over the past eight years to call out neoconservatives on their bullshit, only for them to call bullshit on the left&#39;s now-apparent similar behavior, hit home hard so hard that I actually let out a groan when I realized I had fallen back into that trap again. It had just been long enough between my personal, political paradigm shift and this election cycle that I’d nearly forgotten how easy it is to get swept up in the lies when you&#39;re only searching for one narrative.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, though, while I police myself like this, whatever common ground I may be able to find with Trump supporters (or at least begrudgingly admitting when they were right for calling me out on my shit) is usually quickly lost when some of Trump&#39;s more zealot-like devotees seem to take a left-leaning bias as &quot;proof&quot; of a greater worldwide conspiracy against them and Trump; a nefarious, far-reaching plan to stop their attempts to end globalization, plus whatever shit the Muslims/Blacks/Mexicans/Jews are cooking up this week, as though Al Jolson was playing every blatantly racist, Legion of Doom character in their paranoid little minds, plotting and executing their plans for the great White Genocide. Instead of taking things a step further after spotting the biases on both sides, and realizing that <em>everyone</em> is now acting so cavalier about how malleable we are in highly emotional states, that this same level of meddling with the public almost always requires government oversight in other industries, or at the very least, approval beforehand, but that’s another topic entirely. So,  for whatever forward progress they made in actively recognizing those issues, they immediately took ten steps back when they all but admit they&#39;re okay with Trump&#39;s &quot;version of things&quot; since he&#39;s just gotta do what he&#39;s gotta do to fight back against the establishment (while blatantly ignoring just how pro-establishment Trump, and his cabinet selections, are).</p>

<p><strong>tl;dr:</strong> Long story short, the bias is everywhere, and if you&#39;re the kind of person who thinks &quot;It&#39;s only on &#39;their&#39; side,&quot; or &quot;&#39;They&#39;re&#39; side has more of it&quot; while blatantly overlooking or outright encouraging equally-biased lies to perpetuate on your side, you&#39;re just as guilty as those writing and distributing that propaganda. It&#39;s become damn near impossible to avoid any level of bias now that the &quot;if it bleeds, it leads&quot; ideology from network news has transitioned seamlessly to the internet, encompassing every facet of life (and covering every phobia mankind can think up) that if there exists even the smallest possibility of causing a few thousand people to share a story, there are those sites with no qualms about flat making shit up, while others may draw the line at outright fabrication, but will take the potential hit of having to print a canned retraction later if it turns out to be false. If you&#39;re reading this and thinking of very specific instances where some company you hate pulled shit like this, I promise you there are just as many instances of some company you think has your best interest at heart pulling the exact same stunts, but usually in a way you agree with so &quot;it&#39;s not so bad.&quot; This may seem obvious to some (or even most) of you, but I guarantee you it’s not so clear to others (and even some of you claiming otherwise, as confirmation bias and denial are so very similar). And since someone just mentioning the phrase “confirmation bias” in passing, on some webpage I visited eight years ago, had such a lasting and profound effect on me during a similarly tumultuous political climate, it seems necessary to repeat, especially now that both sides have dropped all pretenses or senses of decorum and are so blatant in their lies that it only takes a cursory Google search to disprove that it makes you wonder how they thought they were going to get away with it. Then, you realize they expect to get away with it (and will) because a large enough majority are now so willingly nodding along to whatever they hear so long it fits the narrative they’ve romanticized, built-up, or in a lot of cases, completely made up.</p>

    <div class="md"><p><strong>tl;dr</strong>: I agree. Moderates and those who align themselves to the middle by default are a quietly dying breed; or maybe they&#39;re not, maybe it really is just one of those &quot;vocal minority&quot; situations, but it doesn&#39;t feel like it. It now feels like the old &quot;vocal minority,&quot; who pestered us with early morning sound bites set as our alarm tones, but were otherwise easy to drown out, have been replaced by a couple dozen 25-to-40-year-olds who literally follow our every footstep, only inches behind, bull-horns in hand and switching between spewing today&#39;s dead-horsed buzzword and calling us pieces of filth who are less than human for daring to ever make <em>them</em> feel guilty about just how awful they are towards humanity in general.</p>

<hr/>

<p>Even my few remaining moderate republican friends (&quot;few remaining&quot; as in most have gone full alt-right, not in that we&#39;ve cut ties) are <em>finally</em> showing concern over seeing their party being eroded from the inside-out by sycophantic hardliners who knew exactly how to play the demographic against itself. My response was cutting ties with the GOP and reevaluating nearly every political (and, by some extensions, moral) ideology I had tentatively held before; their response seems to be flat denial. Although, to be fair, they&#39;ve had another near-decade&#39;s worth of holding on to those ideologies to deal with, too. It&#39;s not as though I spent 20 years of my adult life leaning right only to change up in my 40s; they were really nothing more than ideologies I had co-opted from adults around me when I was in my teens, and never bothered to look into. </p>

<p>That said, 2008-09 was still a very surreal time period for me, not only because I was calling into question my own prejudices after realizing I formed nearly every major political alignment I held out of a gut reaction from the 2003 invasion (I very much bought into the &quot;fighting for democracy&quot; bullshit at 16), but also because my mind couldn&#39;t reconcile the fact of just how childish and petty the right was acting over Obama&#39;s 2008 win. </p>

<p>It was so pathetic, in fact, that I doubted I would ever see that kind of behavior again, yet with each passing year, house Republicans continued to show just how low they were willing to go. But what took the cake was that those very people, both politicians and citizens alike, started going on self-satisfied rants about how &quot;Trump won, so stop complaining,&quot; as though they hadn&#39;t spent the past eight years going well past complaining about Obama; as though they <em>still</em> don&#39;t continue to propagate so-thoroughly-debunked &quot;conspiracy theories&quot; that you have to wonder what 12-year-old binged on Alex Jones videos for a week-and-a-half, thought, &quot;I could do better,&quot; then swiped a few of his Dad&#39;s beers before penning yet another opus showcasing a stunning lack in originality by ultimately ruining the Scooby-Doo reveal at the end, because, you guessed it, it was The Jews<sup>TM</sup> all along.</p>

<p>As bad as the conspiracy theories are, it&#39;s nothing compared to the large majority of my Trump supporting friends who are seemingly so quick to ignore their own past behavior and very-public comments about Obama, liberals, etc. A college buddy of mine went so far as to congratulate himself on the hilarious delusion that if &quot;Clinton had won, I&#39;d have accepted it and moved on,&quot; when he had just made a post, only days prior, talking about the &quot; real action&quot; he&#39;d take if Clinton won; that her securing the position was undeniable proof of treason, and that all Democracy-loving Americans should seriously consider Trump&#39;s &quot;words&quot; on how to deal with another 4 years of a liberal-run country (as in, that not-so-subtle &quot;second amendment&quot; line from August) Literally only days before smugly jerking himself off over the idea of how level-headed and logical he was for &quot;staying above the fray,&quot; he was strongly insinuating that &quot;true Patriots&quot; should take up arms against their country should Clinton have won. As much as I felt like calling that shit out publicly (because there&#39;s nothing quite as satisfying as watching a hardliner backpedal when they realize they may have revealed their hand too soon), I forced myself to remember the person behind the rhetoric, and messaged him instead, simply pointing out that it his claims of being okay with a Clinton presidency ring really false when the very next post on his Timeline is talking about &quot;taking REAL action&quot; against Clinton. No hyperbole or petty name-calling, just pointing that one thing out. I got the best response I could have hoped for in that he didn&#39;t respond, but did delete or hide the post about taking action against Clinton soon after.</p>

<p>Remembering the person is so important, and has been a huge fucking challenge this election cycle. Even after I started leaning more left, I never forgot just how easy it was to get sucked up into those lies and rhetoric, all while convincing yourself that &quot;it must be true if everyone else thinks so, too.&quot; So, in that regard, I&#39;ve always tried my hardest to remember the person behind the politics, at least when it comes to those in my personal life. When I leaned heavily conservative, I didn&#39;t have any ill intentions, but I did come to some wildly misguided conclusions based on statements that I just assumed to be the truth from a young age, as opposed to finding out for myself, or, at the very least, questioning the narrative being displayed. So, even when I could only watch in mild horror as the Tea Party and birther movement spread through the GOP faster than herpes through a whorehouse, I told myself to remember the person when it came to those I know and love who are likely getting swept up in the fervor, as going on the offensive and acting pissed off right out the gate, without so much as attempting to hear their side, only ever causes people to defend their stances even harder. </p>

<p>For example, when my Dad started regurgitating literal sound bites from Fox News about Obama being born in Africa, it was easy to remember that this is my Dad, a man I love and respect, and not some <a href="http://i.imgur.com/BDbK9Ey.jpg">caricature</a> of the prototypical souless conservative that others had created (and one I was starting to agree with, even though I hated the thought of it). So, I just calmly pointed out that the birther story had already been debunked, and he countered for a few minutes until I had to pull out my phone and do the least amount of research possibly needed to disprove an obvious lie, yet a step enough people don&#39;t seem to take (or one they undertake only in the hopes they&#39;ll be right, otherwise ignoring all the evidence to the contrary should they be wrong).</p>

<p>But you know what? It worked, at least to an extent. While he felt embarrassed because he had been telling anyone who would listen about his &quot;misgivings over Obama&#39;s heritage,&quot; he was mostly upset about how he hadn&#39;t even questioned it when he first heard it. He just accepted it because of his view of the democratic party, and never bothered to check for himself. </p>

<p>He still is, and likely always will be, a Republican, or, at least, the kind of Republican he feels the party stood for in the oh-so-glorious Reagan years (which, don&#39;t even get me started on the amount of disillusionment I felt over learning about him after 18 years of him being canonized in my house). However, in the years since the birther conversation, the number of emails I get that qualified for ForwardsFromGrandma and the amount of times he&#39;s gone on a rant about what liberals are trying to do now have dropped dramatically. Maybe he&#39;s just recognizing that he&#39;s got an uphill battle with me in terms of trying to &quot;bring me back to the flock,&quot; and not bothering. Honestly, though, I like think it&#39;s because he had a smaller, but still important, moment like I did in that he recognized a character flaw and tried to course-correct as much as possible.</p>

<p>The problem is, though, that my dad&#39;s reaction to finding out he had believed in, and perpetuated, a lie about a politically and ideologically different person has been rare. For every one person (on both sides) who is willing to accept that they&#39;d been duped (and some will even go on to call themselves out for spreading misinformation), there are 100  who double-down on the denial and group-think, giving themselves wholly over to the whims and delusions of a billionaire CEO whose closest brush with any level of adversity is legitimately feeling victimized over being called out for the abhorrent shit he does and says on a daily basis. And all from his gilded Manhattan high rise, a view from which he has figuratively and literally looked down on the every class below his his entire life.</p>

<p>Save for extreme cases like the Westboro Baptist Church, KKK, and the many militant groups on both sides, I spent the past eight years looking past the politics and remembering that people have very personal reasons for their political alignment, even if they&#39;re poorly formed. But the moment David Duke endorsed Trump, and Trump tried to pretend he was horrified that the once-leader of America&#39;s oldest hate group would align himself wholly with all of Trump&#39;s policies, I knew things were going to be different. </p>

<p>When Trump straight up mocked a disabled person (oops, sorry, was &quot;doing a standard retard&quot; impression, according to Anne Coulter), I knew all sense of decorum was long gone. The very fact people were even debating that Trump was mocking a retarded person, a disabled person, or just &quot;doing a character&quot; made the whole thing worse; it was as though everyone else got the memo and made an unspoken agreement to just argue about his intentions behind the actions as opposed to having any proper sense of shame the fact that the man leading their party only has enough self-control to stop halfway through calling someone a retard during a speech. </p>

<p>This election killed so much of my compassion and empathy, and I&#39;m doing my best to let it grow back, but the vocal fuckery won&#39;t let that happen any time soon.</p>

<p>Whole lotta confirmation bias going around. People don&#39;t want to be wrong, so they use whatever they can to prove that they were &quot;right&quot;, or even that they just chose the lesser evil or something.</p>

<p>Point is, they&#39;re shirking their duties as good citizens by not criticizing that which they voted for. You can vote for people and yet still disagree with things they say and do. Criticism is good, criticism is right. People would have criticized Hillary if she got elected. But she didn&#39;t, Trump did, and now people are trying to criticize him, but it&#39;s not Trump supporters.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Trump&#39;s comments about Epstein&#39;s predilection for young women (in some old magazine profile of Epstein long preceding the revelation of the man&#39;s sexual misdeeds) do not necessarily indicate Trump&#39;s knowledge of illegal activity. One could argue that the casual nature of his remarks - the fact that he would comment upon it at all - instead demonstrates innocent obliviousness to illegal activity.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s Trump shortly before announcing saying Bill Clinton has an Epstein island problem: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAmt8Hm25g0">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAmt8Hm25g0</a></p>

<p>That rape lawsuit was likely a hoax, because it was orchestrated by a former Jerry Springer producer with a record of making outrageous claims about celebrities: <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jul/07/donald-trump-sexual-assault-lawsuits-norm-lubow">https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jul/07/donald-trump-sexual-assault-lawsuits-norm-lubow</a></p>

<p>The lawsuit attempted to link Trump to Epstein and Epstein-like crimes, so I suspect it was commissioned by HRC allies for the purpose of silencing Trump on the aforementioned Clinton-Epstein issue. It worked.</p>

How is building up Putin good for the US? How is starting a trade war with China good for the US? I could go on like that for a while, but it&#39;s too early in the day to get all stirred up.

What I&#39;m saying is that they generate pro-Putin propaganda that can then spread to sites like Reddit through social circles, intersecting with the people who are desperate to believe anything that&#39;s anti-American establishment. If they do that enough times and with enough force, that propaganda can become the norm.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You do realize that a lot of us were in r/conspiracy way before we backed Trump right? So it&#39;s pretty dumb to dismiss a whole bunch of people only because they support Trump. OPs post raises a legitimate question. No mainstream news agencies touched pizzagate but they jumped all over pissgate with nothing but hearsay. There are known pedophilia rings throughout Hollywood and Catholic churches its well documented. So for a lot of people in this sub to be so adamantly against the theory that there is sex trafficking of children going on with Podesta and company really makes me think that it&#39;s this sub that&#39;s compromised and the constant discredit campaign on anyone who subscribes to T_D needs to stop. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>There&#39;s a lot of odd behavior and evidence of something sinister happening around John Podesta, Alfentais, and other people involved in pizzagate. The fact that they had close ties to Epstein who&#39;s been convicted of pedophilia doesn&#39;t play well to your defense. I don&#39;t see why so many people are ready to deny this and say nothing is going on instead of looking more into it. If there&#39;s nothing going on then you have nothing to worry about let the people investigating it continue to do so. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not basing it off of the Epstein connection alone. There&#39;s numerous things I&#39;ve seen that make pizzagate extremely believable. For starters besta Pizza symbol was the actual boy love symbol. The strange behavior and posts on Comet Ping Pong Pizza Instagram account showing a young girl with her hands taped down to a table. Then you have the guy from the Department of Justice whose in charge of Prosecuting these child pedophiles in the area where these pizza shops are making comments all these Instagram pictures that are kind of vague and somewhat sexual. I can go on and on but the best thing you could do is actually research it for yourself if you want me to give you some information I can do so after I get off of work. But as I said this stuff is just the tip of the iceberg it&#39;s a bunch of coincidences after coincidences after coincidences until you kind of realize it&#39;s not really a coincidence at all.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No... The Bundy&#39;s were victims too !  It happened to many rancher families.. Imagine if, illegally and unconstitutionally, a government wanted to have your privately own land for whatever reasons (and your life&#39;s earnings depended on it),  wouldn&#39;t you fight for it to get it stolen?  What would you do if it happened again to another rancher family had the same trouble.. Wouldn&#39;t you want to help them up to fight OFF the BLM (Bureau of Land Management-Federal), acting as if they OWNED your property and decided what to do with it? Add to that the fact that the MSM is pretty much owned by the (shadow) government and uses it to tweak the public opinion and sell all this off as a story with crazy people.. It&#39;s outraging. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s simple, the mods and most vocal users of <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> are doing everything to push their agenda even if it means denouncing evidence and extolling blatant falsehood. They are afraid of how mainstream the anti-Trump sentiments have become since the election. It&#39;s hard to defend democracy while celebrating the election of a candidate that lost the popular vote. It&#39;s hard to contradict a growing mountain of certainty that Trump has colluded with Russian agents. It&#39;s hard to prove that Hilary is tied to a ring of pedophiles and that one of their own came very close to commiting murder over those claims. It&#39;s easy to block out dissent. It&#39;s easy to cover your ears and stamp your feet and say &quot;I know I&#39;m right.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>WOW top comment defending Pissgate and dismissing Pizzagate? It looks like the shills are lurking in the comments. </p>

<p>Your explanation is begging the question, answering a  legitimate question with a bullshit response about &quot;what&#39;s your agenda pushing one conspiracy over another??&quot; That&#39;s because the Pissgate is reported by the WHOLE MEDIA and is unsubstantiated and its combed over and it&#39;s worst case scenario is pushed to the brink. While Pizzagate which is far more dastardly of a conspiracy is pushed under the rug despite rampant child abuse trafficking being evident in governments and institutes of power like the churches all over the world. </p>

<p>Beware all the concern trolls that try to confuse you from looking into the real conspiracy. A safe way to think about it is: if the legacy media is researching and reporting it, it&#39;s fully vetted by TPTB and approved for discussion. If it&#39;s being STIFLED by the legacy media for ANY reason, then it&#39;s unapproved, and you should look closer. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sure. You seem to imply Pizzagate is not suppressed when it&#39;s own subreddit was taken down. That is dismissing it. OP has a legitimate argument, that the Pissgate narrative was even dismissed as BOGUS BY WIKILEAKS, who has 100% track record. They extended themselves quite a bit to put that wording on it. </p>

<p>You aren&#39;t entirely writing it off, no, but by trying to give equal credence to this thought that Russia is some huge enemy that they have viable serious blackmail on trump, despite serious journalists like Glenn Greenwald and JA dismissing the &quot;proof&quot; as most likely propaganda... It&#39;s disingenuous to put these two things in the same realm. </p>

<p>I get that a lot of people want to jump on anything bad against trump and believe me I am ready to join the fight; but don&#39;t bite on shit that&#39;s obviously bullshit. Legacy media cried wolf every single day of the election against trump and it cried too many false alarms and asserted itself in weakness. </p>

<p>So don&#39;t delegitimize a serious question as to why people are so much on board with Pissgate despite seriously flimsy evidence, and Pizzagate is written off every turn left and right and that&#39;s not discussed despite the real creep James alefantis stuff going totally unanswered. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I fully agree with Pizzagate being discussed here, the claims that it&#39;s being suppressed by CTR here are laughable as there are daily posts about it on the front page. By all means, keep it up. All conspiracies deserve to be dug into. I just don&#39;t see how you can claim it&#39;s being written off when there are daily posts here about it on the front page.</p>

<p>And on the same note, no source is infallible. Not even Wikileaks. The more I hear &quot;100% VERIFIED&quot; shouted as proof of anything they claim, the more I am reminded of how religion has propagated itself through the centuries claiming to have an infallible source. Be careful how high of a pedestal you put them on. </p>

<p>Latest example? Wikileaks calling these memos &quot;fake news&quot; by saying it doesn&#39;t look like an intelligence report. Guess what? It isn&#39;t one. It&#39;s raw information gathered by former MI6 as opposition research. He simply decided based on the information that the IC deserved to take a look at it.</p>

<p>Wikileaks obviously has an agenda and they are pushing it. Not surprising they would be out playing damage control with these memos, the memos do not make them look very good.</p>

<p>Even the report you keep referring to about Pissgate has disclaimers that state they don&#39;t stand behind the evidence. And don&#39;t you question at all when the main legacy media pushes a story? It&#39;s usually for the wrong reason, and the OPPOSITE of a conspiracy. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The <a href="https://assets.documentcloud.org/documents/3259984/Trump-Intelligence-Allegations.pdf">Memos</a> now referred to as &quot;Pissgate&quot;. The golden shower portion is a tiny fraction of what these memos allege, and IMO not even worth talking about. Most of it is Trump&#39;s collaboration with Russia over the years and their influence in getting him elected.</p>

<p>For context, this is not a report from the intelligence community. This is opposition research against Trump done by a former MI-6 operative-turned-investigator, who was hired by both Dems and the GOP for his connections in Russia. The only real corroboration so far is by Paul Wood of the BBC, who says a former spy in an Eastern European intelligence agency has also told him about Russia having compromising information on Trump. The MI-6 spy in question has been outed since this release, and has gone to ground.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/5nsj1n/ap_source_trump_aide_in_frequent_contact_with/">Here</a> is a collection of links posted recently exploring Trump&#39;s connections with Russia. More cannon fodder if you are interested.  </p>

<p>Much like Pizzagate, there is a wealth of this information to go through, and evidence is mostly unverifiable. The sources are more credible than people shouting fake would have you believe (and this now includes Wikileaks, sadly). The MI-6 spy who did this report (Christopher Steele) is the same guy who exposed the FIFA corruption. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>If there is more to it then definitely investigate. The people acting like Donald Trump is the savior of the American people need to get a grip and if there is something fishy going on then he needs to be held accountable just as much as Hillary.</p>

<p>Neither candidate was good and that&#39;s an understatement people need to stop this bullshit of trump supporters vs hillary supporters and come together because as an outsider the whole American system is rotten to the core. Everyone needs to stick together and tear this shit down and start fresh.</p>

<p>People are acting like they never heard the phrase divide and conquer. I think this is exactly what is happening the powers that be will always have half the population on their side with the current two party system that is in place over there.</p>

<p>As much as I fucking hate hillary and I really believe there is some weight to the pizzagate narrative I am also under no illusion that trump is no better. I wish that people could stop being at each others throats defending people and parties that don&#39;t really give a fuck about them and come together.</p>

<p>If everyone in america came together and took to the streets I guarantee there would be change but they have it so there will always be a divide in the people and everyone is too busy defending a suspected pedophile or a reality tv star.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m open minded and I don&#39;t discredit one side because I blindly fall in line with the other. If that is the case then obviously something needs to be done. My problem is most people I have seen in threads on the subject have been so quick to discredit pizzagate but this comes up and they are all over it like it has been confirmed as fact.</p>

<p>My other problem with this whole thing is that the media, hillary supporters and the obama administration are scare mongering on a foreign government having a say in american policies but seem to forget that hillary was in the pocket of the saudi&#39;s who are a foreign government and would have had some leverage on american policy  which is fact. Why does nobody give a fuck about that and why is she not held accountable for selling her country off to the highest bidder. I know a presidential candiate in someone&#39;s pocket is not quite the same as as one being blackmailed but at least the one being blackmailed is not willingly selling their country out.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t have a problem with this coming out and I truly believe that people in power should have full transparency and be held accountable. </p>

<p>America is supposedly the land of the free but has the highest rate of incarceration in the world and has also made prisons and incarceration a business where it&#39;s not the likes of hillary that&#39;s filling these jails but the average Joe.</p>

<p>I sound quite anti american but I am not, I am anti bullshit and I think that as an outsider I can&#39;t understand how supporters on both sides can follow these parties that do not give a fuck about any of them. Like I said in a different post people need to forget democrats/republicans and stick together and tear this whole shit down regardless of pizzagate or any other scandal.</p>

<p>The two party system ensures the powers that be always have at least half the population under their thumb regardless of who wins.
Look at obama and how he acts dropping the mic, telling jokes and acting like he does is just that. It&#39;s an act to pull the wool over peoples eyes while he fucks everyone bareback no lube, and while everyone is fawning over how cool he is for a president he is stripping the american public&#39;s right to privacy right under their noses. Not only that but is responsible for how many drone strikes in how any countries killing how many woman and children.</p>

<p>Just look how many upvotes and how many threads were made for him and bidens stupid fucking bromance and how many upvotes that got and then compare that to how many threads and how many upvotes were givin to him stripping back the publics privacy even more right before he is out the door.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>First, let me say I don&#39;t believe in Pizzagate, Pissgate or the Siberian candidate as you cleverly call it.</p>

<p>The main difference is that Pizzagate is based on verifiable yet extremely weak, really stretched out circumstancial evidence. Each of them could reinforce a case if there was something tangible to begin with, but on their own they mean nothing. It&#39;s like nonsense à la Kabbala, you can invent codes that will produce any text you want from any source material, and it will mean absolutely nothing, EXCEPT when you KNOW (and I mean know, not just that someone claims it) there is an encrypted message in it.</p>

<p>The other two on the other hand have no evidence, circumstancial or otherwise. Those who push them claim they have but sorry, can&#39;t show them to you because reasons, but trust them, they wouldn&#39;t lie to you <em>this time,</em> would they?</p>

</blockquote>

<p>I don&#39;t think it was Buzzfeeds choice.</p>

<p>Ben Smith, editor at buzzfeed, has spent the past 3 years trying to build credibility for the Buzzfeed news department. He knew he was walking into a shitstain of a media property when he took the job and he worked hard to reverse the reputation of the company...</p>

<p>Then NBC/Comcast started dumping money into BuzzFeed... $200 million in October of this year.</p>

<p>Suddenly this week, Smith is willing to throw away three years of work in order to publish unverified intel that has been circulating the industry for months without seeing publication.</p>

<p>I think BuzzFeed was a sacrifice play. NBC/Comcast wanted that document to be part of the public dialog, but didn&#39;t want it closely associated with their news team, so they published it using an outlet that allowed them some distance.</p>

<p>Now, the entire media community can reference that document without being guilty of publishing unverified info. BuzzFeed takes the reputation hit for poor journalism and everyone else can talk about golden showers.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>On one hand, a high-profile political figure in Clinton&#39;s inner circle was caught with a phishing scam, (post-server scandal) and their emails were collected. When people dug into them, they discovered pedophilia lingo, and an &quot;internet investigation&quot; ensued. What was discovered was fascinating at best, and incriminating at worst--incrimination of global-elite, pay-to-pay, child-sex-trafficking scandal. The response from the elite was to warn us that Russia could plant child porn on official computers.</p>

<p>On the other side, Obama (not Trump) has wanted a pipeline through Syria for years, but Assad gave those rights to Russia. The CIA created, armed and funded ISIS to topple democratically elected Assad, but Russia stepped in to prevent that. We have been fighting a proxy war against Russia for years. Since losing the election, team ObamaClintonSoros have done everything in their power to ensure continuation of said conflict, and demonization of Russia. &quot;bbbbbut Trump&#39;s gonna smash ISIS&quot;. Simply cutting their funding and letting Putin support a democratically elected president of the region would destroy ISIS without spending a single American taxpayer dollar--in fact, it would save us money. But it would cost (((some people))) money.</p>

<p>&quot;bbbbut Trump was in touch with Moscow after Obama expelled those diplomats&quot;.</p>

<p>That&#39;s not a conspiracy. That&#39;s deft foreign policy. Why do you want to poke the bear? </p>

<p>If you want to be a conspiracy theorist, fine. I am. But some things actually DO happen. Not everything is a lie. That is the state of the global chessboard at the minute. If Trump fucked a Russian hooker while in Moscow to discuss all this with Putin, and they have it on tape, I hope shes hot if I have to watch the tape when it leaks, but aside from marital infidelity, it doesn&#39;t change a whole lot.</p>

<p>Pizzagate, on the other hand, is a bunch of extremely tangible links, some going back 20 fucking years, that a bunch of /pol/tars strung together to form a narrative that hundreds of people in some of the highest positions of our government (although oddly enough, only democrats) have been killing, kidnapping, and raping children for decades.</p>

<p>So, Yeah, Pizzagate is crazy and stupid while Pissgate is actually believable. <a href="/u/Delusional_Liberal">/u/Delusional_Liberal</a></p>

</ul>

<p>Look, you should go through these items yourself and form an opinion after. Some of these are more concerning than others, but all of these emails, connections, art work, etc...when taken together they seem pretty suggestive of the kind of things Podesta and co are interested in.... Can anyone know for sure until a real investigation occurs? No. Is strange taste in art necessarily bad? No.... But all of these mentioned coupled with everything else compiled is enough to raise suspiscions for me. If it isnt for you then i guess we must agree to disagree, but at least now you know that &quot;pizzagate&quot; is more than just one mistyped email being blown out of proportion by crazy people. The podesta emails are a part of research done by individuals that appears to tie into accusations of global pedophile circles. I wont explain everything for you because theres too much and some things might be more intriguing for you than they are to me... Like i said after going through it all, its enough for me to hope it gets looked into. If youd like to continue with your snarky assumption that anyone looking into this is a misinformed idiot then fine, i cant say i didnt try.</p>

<p>Its intended to build the case for you to discern that international pedophile rings with high profile people exist. Then when you see some oddly worded emails from podesta, his taste in art, mention of spirit cooking and his friend Dennis Haster you can start to see how it could definitely be possible they are involved in the same circles....

There have been more than a few studies that have shown that at least 1.9 million illegal aliens voted, most likely because they honestly don&#39;t know it is even illegal to do so.

</blockquote>

<p>Not a whim. It was based on a goal to weaken Georgia. </p>

<p>It&#39;s the same with Ukraine. They want to eventually conquer both territories.</p>

<p>This is their MO. </p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foundations_of_Geopolitics">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foundations_of_Geopolitics</a></p>

<p>Here are some examples from that:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Ukraine should be annexed by Russia because &quot;“Ukraine as a state has no geopolitical meaning, no particular cultural import or universal significance, no geographic uniqueness, no ethnic exclusiveness, its certain territorial ambitions represents an enormous danger for all of Eurasia and, without resolving the Ukrainian problem, it is in general senseless to speak about continental politics&quot;. Ukraine should not be allowed to remain independent, unless it is cordon sanitaire, which would be inadmissible.</p>

<p>Georgia should be dismembered. Abkhazia and &quot;United Ossetia&quot; (which includes Georgia&#39;s South Ossetia) will be incorporated into Russia. Georgia&#39;s independent policies are unacceptable.</p>

<p>Russia should use its special forces within the borders of the United States to fuel instability and separatism, for instance, provoke &quot;Afro-American racists&quot;. Russia should &quot;introduce geopolitical disorder into internal American activity, encouraging all kinds of separatism and ethnic, social and racial conflicts, actively supporting all dissident movements – extremist, racist, and sectarian groups, thus destabilizing internal political processes in the U.S. It would also make sense simultaneously to support isolationist tendencies in American politics.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So it&#39;s okay to use that book to represent a nation&#39;s foreign policy and geopolitical goals 20 years after the fact but the likes of Operation Northwoods, the Gulf of Tonkin, the misuse of the atomic bombs, Iran-Contra, Iraqi death squads, puppet fascist dictators, School of the Americas-trained death squads, Operation Paperclip, MK-ULTRA, etc are inadmissible and not indicative of the US government&#39;s integrity? How many scandals and crimes does there need to be?</p>

<p>Let&#39;s not pretend Russia is some alien malevolent force. They&#39;re right on some things and wrong on others, something you cannot disagree with being the same for America. I&#39;m sure you can give an equally large list of Russian wrongdoing such as the statistically higher murders of journalists, but like I&#39;ve said before, it&#39;s one thing to call a duck a duck but consider the pond we&#39;re all swimming in. It doesn&#39;t help to merely let it stagnate and manufacture propaganda (which was legalized recently in the NDAA, not that the propagandists themselves would&#39;ve told you). You&#39;re doing nothing but feeding the military industrial complex&#39;s lust for power and profit when we should be advocating diplomacy, not endless accusations, posturing and threats.</p>

<p>Luckily, there aren&#39;t too many people falling for this propaganda and trust in the propagandist mainstream media has hit a historical low.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Look into Georgia and Ukraine in the first place and realize you&#39;re merely regurgitating propaganda. Both nations experienced US-backed coups and the new governments began aggression against the Crimeans, Abkhazians and South Ossetians to provoke Russia. These populations by a majority wanted to rejoin Russia. Russia sends troops to prevent further aggression against them. Russia didn&#39;t handle it perfectly, but I&#39;d rather Crimea be in Putin&#39;s hands than those of neo-nazis.</p>

<p>Hillary Clinton is super rich too. What is your opinion of her? It&#39;s one thing to call a duck a duck but consider the pond. Doesn&#39;t stop CIA sycophants here from regurgitating propaganda from TheInterpreterMag ran by two former oligarchs. Trump is backed by the mysterious Warren billionaires also, a web that never gets discussed here.</p>

<p>Russia uses dash cams due to how common traffic accidents are. There are many YouTube videos for you to peruse for an idea of this. Again, perhaps you should actually look into what you&#39;re trying to criticize instead of regurgitating corporate talking points.</p>

<p>RT was created specifically to address Russia&#39;s media problem. But RT operates independently, its journalists do not receive talking points or bribes from the Kremlin.</p>

<p>There was a case regarding Ukraine when RT&#39;s coverage seemed slanted in favor of Russia, and this was largely due to RT relying on the Russian military as sources.

<p>I was watching Chris Matthews and Chris Hayes on MSNBC and both declared the papers to be fake as hell and piss gate being pure bullshit. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>The transcript below, according to your source. There is no mention of &quot;both declared the papers to be fake as hell and piss gate being pure bullshit.&quot;</p>

<p>CHRIS MATTHEWS: Buzzfeed&#39;s editor-in-chief Ben Smith was on MSNBC earlier tonight on Meet the Press Daily. Here&#39;s how he defended his decision to release those documents.</p>

<p>MATTHEWS: Andrew Sullivan, what do you make of that defense of putting out all this information, even if this gentleman didn&#39;t actually believe it was true?</p>

<p>MATTHEWS: Yeah.</p>

<p>MATTHEWS: Let me go to Hugh, because it seems to me that even if you deal in opinion journalism, which I do as well, you have to deal with a fact-based mentality. You have to say, “I&#39;m never going to say something on the air I don&#39;t believe is true. At least from my perspective.” But to put out a barrel of stuff that&#39;s marked as “disinformation” for the public to sort of enjoy, for the enemies of that particular person, Trump, to giggle over and try to exploit, and enjoy generally and say, “This is my day,” is not—It’s certainly not journalism. I&#39;m not sure what it is.</p>

<p>Some Trump tweets:</p>

<p>*Donald J. Trump ‏@realDonaldTrump  Jan 11
Russia just said the unverified report paid for by political opponents is &quot;A COMPLETE AND TOTAL FABRICATION, UTTER NONSENSE.&quot; Very unfair!</p>

<p>Donald J. Trump ‏@realDonaldTrump  Jan 11
Intelligence agencies should never have allowed this fake news to &quot;leak&quot; into the public. One last shot at me.Are we living in Nazi Germany?*</p>

<p>Isn&#39;t it odd that Trump treats US intelligence as liars, incompetent, the enemy etc., yet anything that &quot;Russia says&quot; is given as fact?</p>

<p>Don&#39;t let the piss angle distract from the real issue, which is that Trump has connections to Russia and has given them compromising info and has promised to give Russia what they want politically.</p>

<p>Oh wait nm, I&#39;m sure it&#39;s that this &quot;conspiracy&quot; which has no evidence, been debunked by dozens of news outlets (MSM is shit but when a dozen of them say the same thing, they probably aren&#39;t lying, imagine that) is just not something the mods want to hear about and removed it despite the mountains of zero evidence /s</p>

<p>This nonsense about Trump has already been shown to have numerous factual errors. And the MSM had no uniform action with it. It had the extreme left DNC propagandists trying to push it and the leftist MSM sat back and realized it was too stupid to be real. </p>

<p>Also next to nothing has been shown to be false regarding the really important topic of child abduction. The rabbit hole only goes deeper and deeper. Only the media keeps saying it&#39;s false. That&#39;s a gigantic difference. Regarding Trump, multiple factual errors of /pol LARPing have been publicly verified. Like that Cohen has never been to Prague and was home in America when he was supposed to be there with irrefutable proof he was in America.</p>

<p>People came to <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> to talk about that conspiracy because, well, <em>it is a conspiracy</em> - it&#39;s the relevant sub.  At least it would be if this sub isn&#39;t so overrun by T_D that its mod team literally aren&#39;t allowing anti-Trump submissions.  It may as well be called <a href="/r/proTrumpConspiracies">/r/proTrumpConspiracies</a> now.</p>

<p>Calling what happened a <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a> brigade is like calling that recent kidnapping <a href="/r/news">/r/news</a> thread a T_D brigade.  Both are unreasonable to characterize as such.  <em>Of course</em> people from <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a> were in the thread.  It&#39;s relevant to their interests, just as the &quot;war on white people&quot; is relevant to T_D&#39;s interests, so obviously a lot of people were in that kidnapping <a href="/r/news">/r/news</a> thread.</p>

<p>As a regular <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a> poster, take my word for it that there was no organized brigade on this subreddit that was conducted behind the scenes.  Take your tinfoil hat off.  I don&#39;t even know how that would happen.  Feel free to point to any threads that said &quot;hey <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a>, lets go brigade conspiracy&quot;.</p>

<p>I think to some extent, PissGate was just another thing for Trump&#39;s critics to poke fun at, regardless of whether it was true or not. If it&#39;s not this thing, then it would just be something else. </p>

<p>But for those that are more inclined to believe in the claims, to them, it&#39;s justified as it seems to fit in with the circus act that they perceive in Trump. As such, and as ideological enemies, they don&#39;t need as much evidence, nor do they motivated as such, as that would be a challenge to their narrative.</p>

<p>One does not simply &quot;believe&quot; or &quot;not believe&quot; pizzagate.</p>

<p>There are a lot of made up or misleading pieces of evidence in the pizzagate investigation, but there is also a lot of real evidence.</p>

<p>Believing that the pedophiles who have already been convicted (Epstein, Hastert, Weiner, etc) are not the only powerful people involved in that is not a stretch at all.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s a believability issue.  Most people have no trouble believing that a billionaire who has been caught on tape saying some nasty things about women and who was the posterboy for the excesses of Manhattan in the 80s would hire hookers to do deplorable things.  The story involves three people doing something in one place at one time, and is the kind of thing they can believe happened.  Pizzagate, on the other hand, concerns a widespread conspiracy between many players over many years in many locations.  It takes more effort to imagine something like that really taking place.  Doesn&#39;t mean it isn&#39;t true.  It just sounds more outlandish.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>In the long run, sure. The question, though, was why so many people were willing to believe the Trump rumors so quickly.  The answer is easy - it was a believable story that could be conveyed and digested in less than a minute and that was discussed on a major media site.  Pizzagate, on the other hand, is a complicated story that relies upon an understanding of code words and a cast of players who are largely unknown to the general populous, with a few notable exceptions, and isn&#39;t being discussed by major media that anyone pays attention to.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Human beings want to feel like they&#39;re the best. Feeling like you won an argument on the internet makes you feel like you&#39;re the best for a few minutes. Earlier this year a whole bunch of people read a whole bunch of Huffington Post articles that made them think it was smart to elect a geriatric Jew that would make tax payers pay off the 200K in loans they took out to pay for their degrees in feminist interpretive dance. When they failed to convince enough of people the who agree with a most of their political views to elect the geriatric Jew, the geriatric Jew told them to support the reptilian Queen who he&#39;d been calling evil for the better part of a year. 95% of the old Jews supporters didn&#39;t really possess the ability to think critically so they supported the reptilian Queen. The Huffington Post writers, being in that 95%, wrote articles explaining that while the reptilian Queen was at one time evil, she was not as evil as the tube of bronzed custard, because although their political ideology is almost identical, the tube of bronzed custard doesn&#39;t pretend to be as nice to people as the reptilian Queen. When the bronzed custard eventually beat the reptilian Queen in the game everyone assumed to be rigged in her favor, the interpretive dancers didn&#39;t know what to do with themselves. The dancers looked far and wide for what went wrong &quot;he&#39;s mean&quot; &quot;he&#39;s custard&quot; &quot;I still have to pay for this degree?&quot; &quot;He&#39;ll probably murder the same brown people she will but she pretends were important better&quot;. Being right is important to some people. Now that they have to deal with the fact that they were wrong the interpretive dancers, rather than critically analyze the broken nature of the system, or the fact that they aren&#39;t actually represented, they just found ways to justify how they were still right. The reason they found is Russia.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Pissgate is the name for the fact that the russians have a number of video tapes of trump in compromising situations involving trump and other men pissing on each other for sexual pleasure ( among other things, it should be noted that the report does not make a single mention of women ) This came to light from a 35 page report which was compiled by a British intelligence officer that was leaked to the media. The source of the report has been verified. </p>

<p>Turns out that many intelligence agencies have similar reports compiled by their own agents, obama was briefed on this back in september as well as it being included in the intelligence briefings which trump has chosen to skip.</p>

<p>The only part of the report that has been debunked is that russia claims to not have such tapes, and trump got really angry and started calling CNN fake news ( CNN had a similar but different report that they chose not to publish any information from until they were able to investigate further. Someone else beat them to the scoop so they started reporting about what they had. ) </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I am rare as I still have both Democrats and Republicans on my Facebook page.  ;-)</p>

<p>My theory is that neither side gives much if any thought to the truth or falsity of any claims they make.  Instead, they mindlessly repost things that damage their enemies or succor their friends.</p>

<p>But the reason PissGate has got more traction than PizzaGate is that it is far less extreme and thus more believable, absent any hard evidence.</p>

<p>Consider the story - that four years Trump paid two prostitutes to piss on a bed.  Suppose someone told you that your male friend X did exactly this - what would you think?</p>

<p>I&#39;m sure I&#39;d be surprised - but not horrified.  Assuming he had otherwise been decent (i.e. not physically abusing the sex workers, etc), I&#39;d laugh it off - it probably wouldn&#39;t affect our relationship at all.  I certainly wouldn&#39;t tell anyone!</p>

<p>But the PizzaGate allegations - those are <em>nasty</em>.  If a friend told me they were involved in sexual traffic and murder of children, I <em>would</em> be horrified.  I&#39;d go to the cops in an instant, or if there were no way, I&#39;d certainly cut them off forever.</p>

<p>The claims of PizzaGate are so horrible that even sharing it with your friends is nasty.  This is why it had less traction.</p>

<p>Oh, and you can&#39;t underestimate the bias of the media too.</p>

<p>The Trump dossier actually has substantial support by independent reporting and corroborating intelligence officials. But assholes think it&#39;s been debunked because they&#39;re delusional and because their tribal allegiances overwhelm good sense.</p>

<p>Pizzagate is complete and utter nonsense and has been found so by every single independent professional journalist. It doesn&#39;t even pass a cursory bullshit test. Which, to believers, just means it&#39;s true because they&#39;re barking mad. </p>

<p>It&#39;s not as simple as Trump said it was &#39;Fake News&#39; so r/conspiracy ignores it, MSM said its &quot;Fake News&#39; so <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> pursues it. I think the biggest difference is that there is actual evidence of massive global pedophilia rings. That isn&#39;t even a conspiracy theory, its a conspiracy fact. They exist. The idea that pedophiles would promote other pedophiles in office also makes a ton of sense, for blackmail and control purposes. So while there isn&#39;t a lot of &quot;tangible evidence&quot; regarding Pizzagate, pandora&#39;s box just keeps getting bigger and bigger the more people investigate it. Not to mention the ppl accused are acting super sketchy in rxn to it. 
Whereas Pissgate just doesn&#39;t really make any logical sense. Trump defended himself perfectly, he is a public figure, he knows he is being watched, he knows his behavior is constantly being scrutinized. Why would he travel to a foreign country and then let his guard down and hire prostitutes to piss on a bed that Obama had slept on? Ppl who say &quot;Trump is a moron, he hates Obama, why wouldn&#39;t he do this?&quot; Are missing the point here. This behavior literally doesn&#39;t accomplish anything. I&#39;m not saying its impossible that Trump could be a pervert, he&#39;s said a lot of perverted, sexist and weird things. It&#39;s not a conspiracy that he is a womanizer, that&#39;s a wide open blatant fact. I&#39;m just saying that by and large he is incredible pragmatic.</p>

<p>One does not simply &quot;believe&quot; or &quot;not believe&quot; pizzagate.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Look into Georgia and Ukraine in the first place and realize you&#39;re merely regurgitating propaganda. Both nations experienced US-backed coups and the new governments began aggression against the Crimeans, Abkhazians and South Ossetians to provoke Russia. These populations by a majority wanted to rejoin Russia. Russia sends troops to prevent further aggression against them. Russia didn&#39;t handle it perfectly, but I&#39;d rather Crimea be in Putin&#39;s hands than those of neo-nazis.</p>

<p>Hillary Clinton is super rich too. What is your opinion of her? It&#39;s one thing to call a duck a duck but consider the pond. Doesn&#39;t stop CIA sycophants here from regurgitating propaganda from TheInterpreterMag ran by two former oligarchs. Trump is backed by the mysterious Warren billionaires also, a web that never gets discussed here.</p>

<p>Russia uses dash cams due to how common traffic accidents are. There are many YouTube videos for you to peruse for an idea of this. Again, perhaps you should actually look into what you&#39;re trying to criticize instead of regurgitating corporate talking points.</p>
