        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>So a couple of years ago I was going through some hardships and my friend (who&#39;s name will remain anonymous, we&#39;ll just call him Jerry) was there to lend me some company while I was going through this. Me and Jerry would frequently smoke weed together and sit back and talk for hours, usually on weekends when he would come over. One night he asked me to hang out in the downtown area, so I obliged, we proceeded to go to a house where we were going to buy some weed and they invited us inside (typically my dealers were always in pretty nice houses and never had any sort of nefarious looking friends, this time was different) we went inside and there was a group of people partying a little bit and I sat down next to this guy who was being pretty quiet and just looking around the room, I never asked his name and he never asked for mine, but at a certain point he asked me if I had a cigarette, I let him bum one off of me and that started a conversation. </p>

<p>We talked about this and that for a while, the fact that I was from a bigger city and his travels around the country, when he dropped a big bomb on me &quot;You know... I feel like I can trust you... So I&#39;m going to let you know... We&#39;re everywhere...&quot; I was taken back by this and asked him what he meant by that and he said &quot;Masons... The Freemasons I mean... We&#39;re everywhere... In plain site... That&#39;s the best place to hide.&quot; I looked at him for a moment and said &quot;Why are you telling me this?&quot; he then proceeded to tell me &quot;I don&#39;t know man... I feel like something is about to happen and I want someone to know about this...&quot; at first I didn&#39;t believe him until I saw the ring on his finger with the masonic symbol and the number 32 engraved on the underside (which he showed me) I asked him what that meant and he said &quot;That 32 right there... Represents my level in the society... I&#39;m a 32nd degree mason, one of the highest levels... And now I feel uneasy...&quot; at this point I started to feel uneasy myself but, against my better judgement, I pushed forward for answers... I asked him &quot;So do you guys like... Actually control the media and stuff?&quot; in a joking way, to try and gauge his response, he responded with &quot;That&#39;s something that I wish you hadn&#39;t asked... But because I honestly feel like I may not be around much longer, I see no reason to keep it a secret... Yeah... We control it... Everything from Dora the Explorer to Katy Perry and CNN... It&#39;s all ours and we use it to keep you blind.&quot; I asked him what they were keeping us blind to and he said &quot;The world... What&#39;s happening right in front of your eyes... The secret genocide and massacre of the population...&quot; that&#39;s when he really went off on a tangent, I felt like I was being pulled down the rabbit hole, he continued with &quot;See I sell drugs... That&#39;s my job in the society... I sell drugs to people to keep them... The people... dumbed down and in a state of euphoria... Those overdoses you hear about on the news, those ain&#39;t overdoses, those drugs are concentrated by Freemasons, they&#39;re more powerful, more potent so that, what seems like a regular dose, is actually 100 times more powerful.&quot; he took a deep breath and let out a sigh and continued &quot;Sometimes I feel bad about what I&#39;m doing, shit, maybe that&#39;s why they want me gone, because I have a conscious, maybe it&#39;s because they can see my soul and know that I don&#39;t want to do this no more... I don&#39;t know, but they don&#39;t like it... Whatever you do... If you see something that looks Masonic... Stay the hell away from it man, don&#39;t go near it... They&#39;ll know I told you these things and don&#39;t think they won&#39;t, they have eyes and ears everywhere.&quot; he then pointed to a guy sitting in a chair that was glaring at him and said &quot;That man right there is gonna kill me when y&#39;all leave, trust that... No doubt about it man, he don&#39;t like what I&#39;m saying and he&#39;s 33rd degree... He&#39;ll take me out for sure.&quot;</p>

<p>During that entire exchange I was completely speechless and had no idea what to do with myself, that mans face is burned into my mind, the man glaring at him from across the room had such evil in his eyes and to this day I look around every corner making sure nobody is following me or trying to kill me, maybe my vigilance is what keeps them at bay, constantly surrounding myself with people, making sure there&#39;s at least one other person with me at all times, unless I know I&#39;m in a secure place, I don&#39;t know... Why they haven&#39;t tried to take me yet is beyond me... But I&#39;ve seen them... Lurking around, keeping their eyes and ears on me at all times, making sure I don&#39;t slip up... I pretend that I don&#39;t see them, hell I&#39;ve done a good job at convincing myself that they aren&#39;t really there, that it&#39;s in my head. But this secret is killing me more than my fear of them is... I never saw that man again... I even went back to that house to buy weed again, secretly looking for him to see if he was alright but I never saw him ever again, I saw the man with the evil eyes again, but never him... Those eyes will haunt me forever... But the words of that mason will forever reverberate in my mind.</p>

<p>Thank you for reading this, I hope you understand that it is with great risk that I post this, I don&#39;t know what will happen next, all I can do is provide the truth... I accepted death a long time ago, that it was an inevitability, that it would happen one day... I don&#39;t fear it and I don&#39;t believe I should... The stress this has had on me has really put a toll on my mind and this is the only way I can find relief.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>When I came here minutes after pissgate, and was here the following hours, it appeared to me that everyone took 4chan seriously. And the wild claims were, exactly that, wild.. But...alot of people were on board. And to me it&#39;s like a pivotal moment in American history, and maybe a defining moment for American politics, and a definite moment of sink or swim for MMS, was ALL attributed to 4chan. 
Let that sink in. In short 4chan was claiming to have done all that, plus make its way and fool the intelligence community enough to have made in to the American daily presidential intelligence briefing. 
And the scary thing is I can&#39;t say with certainty that it  wasn&#39;t them..but without evidence im hesitant to say Yay or nay. I definitely lean towards nay, but shit, with a nay stance, I&#39;d lose a vaild debate </p>

<p>So really, Idk wtf. Time will tell I guess. But currently I think there is a good chunk of the world that is taking 4chan as seriously as a heart attack. Which, really I don&#39;t know what that says about everything...ugh...</p>

<p>Sure, here in <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>, you&#39;ll find lots of that kind of groupthink. <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> is 1/3 <a href="/r/The_Donald">/r/The_Donald</a> 1/3 4chan and 1/3 actual conspiracy theory.</p>

<p>Eh, I can&#39;t say with certainty that it wasn&#39;t a campaign of disinformation against the loyal heroes of 4chan either... but I&#39;m more inclined to be neutral in all things until the evidence compels me to do otherwise.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is the worst fan fiction ever. You people seriously need to find lives.</p>

<p>I could pick this apart to hell but ill simply point out theres no such thing as a &quot;32nd degree Freemason ring&quot;. Fremasons that are initiated to the 33rd degree at the 29th level. 30-33 is one long initian with several steps.  </p>

<p>Freemasons also arent the only secret society on the planet you dweebs. </p>

<p>Only difference is &quot;the powers that be&quot; cant simply be dumbed down to Freemasons. Even my 55 year old father who doesnt believe in most modern conspiracies knows theres more than one secret society that has its hand in running the planet. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>the 33rd is an honorary degree, and a functional degree. Basically there are two versions. One is given as a thankyou for dedicated service to the fraternity, the other is a designation as a regional officer of what is called the &quot;Scottish Rite.&quot; The latter of which there are only 33 people at any given time, who are part of &quot;the supreme council&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>ehhhhh you&#39;re right and you&#39;re wrong. There&#39;s no official 32nd degree ring given to you when you&#39;ve had your 32nd degree... but you can definitely buy one. There is however a 14th degree ring which is (usually) given to you. That&#39;s what I wear. There&#39;s no rule saying &quot;wear this ring, wear that ring&quot; its jewelry... to each their own in taste and use.</p>

<p>And there is what&#39;s wrong with the modern &quot;conspiracy theory&quot; community. All conspiracy, no theory. Logic, rigor and evidence. These three forces will topple tyrants and oppressors of all sorts, but fear, ignorance and willful credulity? Those will eat away at the foundations of any community.</p>

<p>Sharing information never eats away at a community foundation. It&#39;s literally the foundation itself. If we shut people down when they share their own experiences, we end up making it less likely to occur and could end up detouring someone from sharing something vital. </p>

<p>It seems odd that, given the chance to ask someone questions about our Fraternity (which you could also do over on <a href="/r/freemasonry">/r/freemasonry</a>), you get scared and don&#39;t want to. The whole concern here is that someone who may or may not have been a Mason told you something scary. I&#39;d think you&#39;d want to confirm or refute that...</p>

<p>Unless you&#39;re clinging to your assumption because, disturbing though it might be, you&#39;ve become comfortable with the feeling.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>you simply think I&#39;m an idiot</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I assure you, that while I think you&#39;re gullible, I don&#39;t equate that with being an idiot. Idiots are incapable of moving past their gullibility, given better information. You have yet to prove that you&#39;re in that category.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, it opens up a wide variety of areas of interest, so, as a hobby for some (like me) it opens up a huge segment of history to learn, read about, see how it intertwines with other areas of history and study. Some, love the performance aspect of performing the rituals, its a bit like acting and being on stage. For some, its a group of trusty buds to play poker with, or have a cigar and a scotch while talking about the deeper meanings of the universe. Some love chasing down all the threads of our origins. Some love the symbolism and get super deep into the meanings of the symbols.</p>

<p>At its core its basically a philosophy club, with a long history, and a core concept of improving the self.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>&quot;Masons... The Freemasons I mean... We&#39;re everywhere... In plain site... That&#39;s the best place to hide.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Of course, you proceeded to believe him.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;That 32 right there... Represents my level in the society... I&#39;m a 32nd degree mason, one of the highest levels... </p>
</blockquote>

<p>If he said that, literally that, then there are three possibilities:</p>

<ul>
<li>You made up this story</li>
<li>He bought the ring on ebay or similar and had no idea what it meant.</li>
<li>He was actually a 32nd degree Scottish Rite Mason who didn&#39;t know what that meant.</li>
</ul>

<p>The latter happens pretty often. Being a 32nd degree is something that can, reasonably, happen within your first week in Freemasonry if you work hard to schedule things that way. No, really. It&#39;s just a title, like any other, and some jurisdictions give it away like candy. Others take time to convey what it means and what the symbolism behind those degrees mean. If both you and he were telling the truth up to this point in your story, then he clearly had not learned what it meant to be Scottish Rite Mason. Part of being that is a compassion for all mankind, and feeding you this silly story would exhibit exactly the opposite.</p>

<p>But more on that in a bit...</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Yeah... We control it... Everything from Dora the Explorer to Katy Perry and CNN...</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yep, he was having fun with you. Welcome to being had.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>that&#39;s when he really went off on a tangent, I felt like I was being pulled down the rabbit hole...</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You were being pulled, alright, but it was just your leg.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;That man right there is gonna kill me when y&#39;all leave, trust that... No doubt about it man, he don&#39;t like what I&#39;m saying and he&#39;s 33rd degree... He&#39;ll take me out for sure.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I really hope you&#39;re making this up. I do. Because the alternative is that you&#39;re this gullible.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>But I&#39;ve seen them... Lurking around, keeping their eyes and ears on me at all times, making sure I don&#39;t slip up... I pretend that I don&#39;t see them, hell I&#39;ve done a good job at convincing myself that they aren&#39;t really there, that it&#39;s in my head.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Did you get lost on your way to <a href="/r/TargetedIndividuals">/r/TargetedIndividuals</a> ? I really think you&#39;d get a better reception for your stories, there.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Thank you for reading this, I hope you understand that it is with great risk that I post this</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Oh, I&#39;m totally going to report you to the guy that orders the sodas for our dinner. He&#39;s gonna tell the guy that makes the rings and he&#39;ll tell the 37th degree barber to &quot;give him the duck&#39;s ass.&quot; You don&#39;t mess with the duck&#39;s ass! :-)</p>

<p>Seriously, if this was fiction, 6/10. If it was not, then... well, I&#39;m sorry that you so easily believe such fiction.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Keep your chin up. Thanks for relaying the info. I can accept your story without the need to believe it or discredit it. I will use the info in my own life as necessary. For the record, I had this happen to me once. It was a bum on the bus in Dallas. He told me lots of things about the Clintons&#39; drug operation (very specific details) including that he was ex-CIA. A few months later, the book &quot;The Clinton Chronicles&quot; came out and verified his info. Really freaked me out. </p>
