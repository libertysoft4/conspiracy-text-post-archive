<p>Also, I believe Hillary is a criminal, Bernie would destroy our economy, Jill Stein was literally retarded and Gary Johnson was in way over his head. This isn&#39;t about my side vs yours. We should all be on the same side.</p>

<p>Edit: Didn&#39;t see the sticky post until after I posted this. No, I haven&#39;t been active here in a while, but that&#39;s mainly because of the war from both sides that&#39;s been waged (and, it looks like won) here.</p>

<p>Edit 2: Also, I would like to say, I am not accusing this sub of being pro trump or anything. This is a larger view, of my personal friends and acquaintances along with what I&#39;ve seen online.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If Hillary gets prosecuted by Trump, or anyone of the matter, while Obama still resides as President, he can pardon Hillary from any wrongdoings thus making her immune to any penalties. By saying he (Trump) will not prosecute, he puts the ball in Obama&#39;s court; if Obama pardons Hillary (unconditional pardon) before his term of President is up, that would essentially be an admission of guilt that Hillary broke the law.  It&#39;s best to wait a week and see what happens.  We are living in exciting times my friend!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Saying he wont prosecute sets the stage for the Democrats to shoot themselves in the foot. She can apply for pardon, admitting she is guilty of <em>something</em>, or Obama can pardon admitting <em>he</em> thinks she is guilty of <em>something</em>. By not doing anything, and saying he won&#39;t pursue prosecution Trump is backing Obama/Clinton into a corner... They are damned if they do basically.</p>

<p>Post innauguration and intelligence agency can <em>&quot;discover ner information&quot;</em> that would change Trumps mind about prosecution, thereby keeping his initial promise, and still being able to claim prosecution is now neccessary.  </p>

<p>What Trump is doing is creating plausible deniability that he is not conducting a political witch hunt. </p>

<p>I will change my views on a great many things regarding Trump if Hillary isn&#39;t on the way to swinging by her neck within a couple months.</p>

<p>I&#39;ll say this as well. If Hillary gets pwned we might have a real president here. Imperfect yes, but these snakes never eat their own in any substantive way.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I am in total agreeance with you here. If nothing happens with Clinton it&#39;s time to turn on Trump. I think proper disclosure on the Clinton crime syndicate would be a hugely unifying event, and after having to eat a lot of shit maybe we might see some converted mindsets from the alt-left.</p>

<p>If Clinton gets hammered it&#39;s definitely a good indication he may be legit.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Right after the election it wasn&#39;t clear if protests were going to engulf the nation or not. I think Trump laid off of Hillary to try and ease the unrest about his presidency from the crazy leftists. New info just came out from one of the intelligence agencies about new emails that prove Hillary committed another crime. Maybe he&#39;ll prosecute that. If he won&#39;t, I think it&#39;s just to ease unrest. It&#39;s not important that Hillary is punished, it&#39;s important to unite the country behind an upright leader like Trump. He will prove himself on the economy with his numbers, and hopefully get some of the liberal vote in the next election in four years. He doesn&#39;t need to piss off the left by putting their nice granny in jail.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If he is clearly involved in the prosecution, it could appear to some (and would be spun by the media) as purely politically motivated. To me, it seems as though there is more than enough to warrant an investigation, and any Trump involvement would cloud the legitimacy of the investigation, so why be closely involved?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I am not a Trump supporter, so I am not saying this to defend him but I don&#39;t think that he could do anything about it until he is actually in power. He&#39;s still just the president-elect. And if he isn&#39;t in bed with the cabal and does plan to prosecute her, it&#39;s best to not be open about it and wait til Obama and co are gone. Or there could be other stuff going on behind the scenes like deals being made to grant clemency to some people like Hillary so that the cabal backs off in other ways. But I&#39;m obviously just guessing.</p>

<p>It&#39;s tough to pinpoint exactly what&#39;s going on or talk with surety when it comes to these kind of things because there are so many layers of info/disinfo between regular people and these high-up power positions/structures.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, this post is definitely about Jill Stein. Look bro that&#39;s just my opinion of her, I disagree with and think everything she stood for is stupid as shit. She was basically the uber liberal version of Trump - sounds good and says things people wanna hear but has no clue how to do it, and no business being in politics.</p>

<p>But I digress. Didn&#39;t mean to hurt your feelings with insulting Jill Stein. Like i said, this is about how the election and impending Trump presidency is (possibly) scripted, to a certain degree.</p>
