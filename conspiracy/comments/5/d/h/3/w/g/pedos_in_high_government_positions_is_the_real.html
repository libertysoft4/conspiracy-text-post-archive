    <div class="md"><p>I think there is a secret black budget space program that has technology that can easily get us to the moon and Mars and maybe even beyond.</p>

<p>I do believe we went to the moon, but I doubt we did that using rockets.</p>

<p>This is a great documentary about a possible secret spacecraft that has been around for a while:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CkVNv7PbeH8">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CkVNv7PbeH8</a></p>

<p>Also, in 1995, Ben Rich, CEO of Lockheed Skunkworks said “we now have the technology to take ET home”:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.mufon.com/video-testimonies-3/in-1995-ben-rich-ceo-of-lockheed-skunkworks-said-we-now-have-the-technology-to-take-et-home-as-can-be-seen-in-this-video">http://www.mufon.com/video-testimonies-3/in-1995-ben-rich-ceo-of-lockheed-skunkworks-said-we-now-have-the-technology-to-take-et-home-as-can-be-seen-in-this-video</a></p>

<p>And there&#39;s more evidence there is a secret black budget space program. Nasa is most likely a smokescreen, a PR campaign to keep us occupied and the real technology hidden.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes I agree. That&#39;s where it all started. And there might be different factions as well. Some say the Navy has their own space program called Solar Warden and then there&#39;s other programs within the secret black budget world, most likely dominated by private industry.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have never experienced moonlight having an effect on temperature, and I live in an area that ranges from -20 to 100.  Why point a directional antenna, at the ocean? You know GPS is an array of satellites, right?  You are lacking scale, it seems you think the earth is somehow small... Surveying is done on a local scale, curvature of the earth is negligible at these distances, unless you were to build a 10 mile long warehouse and wanted a flat floor from end to end.  Provide these videos that make your point. 
Do you have any books that you can recommend on this subject? </p>

<p>As for the sun and moon, what do you see every day? It&#39;s exactly as you observe it.  The sun comes into your perspective and then leaves it as it orbits around like a groove in phonograph plane.  Within this large orbit the shape and size of the circle provides the seasons.   Since it&#39;s not XXX millions miles away and instead only a few hundred miles (see how the rays of sun go through a cloud?) it&#39;s only illuminating a specific section of the land at any one time.  Want to really go for a trip?  Start questioning gravity as that is also just a bullshit theory to help explain BS classical physics.  Tesla was right, Einstein is a fraud along with all the other high priest scientists.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Back to my previous question.  Are you claiming that all other planets have their main surface, not the edge, facing directly at earth?  What force or circumstances make this so?<br/>
If the earth is flat, the entire earth should experience dawn and dusk at relatively the same time, not hours apart, how do you account for this NOT being the case?
When you go outside on a clear night and you look at the sky, what do you think the little lights are?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ll check those docs when I get home.  But when you get into these &quot;space&quot; agencies you need to study how they were formed.  Starting with operation paperclip, Von Braun, Jack Parsons, JPL, crowley, hubbard. Also note that mkultra and all the intelligence and signals crap from WW2 had reached it&#39;s maturity.</p>
