        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Some discoveries from Wikileaks : Hillary is paying for the defense of a haitian child trafficker with a lawyer who is a convicted child trafficker.</p>

<p>Hillary and her campaign manager john podesta and top aide hums abedin  is associated with marina abramovic who conducts blood rituals . Podesta keeps in  touch with convicted child molester former speaker of the House &quot;Denny&quot; (he call him Denny because they are close) Hastert</p>

<p>Proof</p>

<hr/>

<p>Child trafficking</p>

<p>Hillary paid for the legal defense of a haitian woman caught illegally taking 33 children from haiti . The children were not even orphans so no &quot;better life&quot; excuse. The lawyer they paid for WAS A CONVICTED CHILD TRAFFICKER.
The individual in question is one Laura Silsby, former director of The New Life Children&#39;s Refuge. She was caught trying to steal 33 children from the country, most of whom were not even orphans and had families. Hillary has a LONG history of interest in Ms. Silsby. Wikileak emails dating back till at least 2001 have been found in her archives discussing Laura&#39;s NGO. Laura had claimed she planned to build an orphanage in the Dominican Republic, but authorities in the country said she never submitted an application for this purpose. They instead located to Haiti. Sources: <a href="https://wikileaks.org/plusd/cables/10BUENOSAIRES166_a.html">https://wikileaks.org/plusd/cables/10BUENOSAIRES166_a.html</a> <a href="https://wikileaks.org/clinton-emails/emailid/3465">https://wikileaks.org/clinton-emails/emailid/3465</a> Huma Abedin was constantly forwarding Hillary articles on this woman&#39;s organization: <a href="https://wikileaks.org/clinton-emails/emailid/2772">https://wikileaks.org/clinton-emails/emailid/2772</a> One of the first things Hillary did when she took over the scene in Haiti was to get Laura off the hook: <a href="http://harvardhrj.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/King.pdf">http://harvardhrj.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/King.pdf</a> And the attorney who represented Laura Silsby? A man who was himself convicted as a sex trafficker: <a href="https://wikileaks.org/gifiles/docs/32/323249_-os-haiti-us-legal-adviser-to-u-s-haiti-missionaries.html">https://wikileaks.org/gifiles/docs/32/323249_-os-haiti-us-legal-adviser-to-u-s-haiti-missionaries.html</a> Even more disturbing, we uncovered an email in Wikileaks where they are literally pricing how much it costs to transport children: <a href="https://wikileaks.org/clinton-emails/emailid/3741">https://wikileaks.org/clinton-emails/emailid/3741</a> Again, this was the same group that got busted by Haitian Authorities trying to Traffic kids. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Life_Children%27s_Refuge_case">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Life_Children%27s_Refuge_case</a> They&#39;re in the Clinton Emails; <a href="https://wikileaks.org/clinton-emails/emailid/3741">https://wikileaks.org/clinton-emails/emailid/3741</a></p>

<p>Marina Abramovic association with Hillary campaign manager family and hillary top aode Hima Abedin</p>

<p>The Clinton Foundation gave spiritcooker Preistess Marina Abramovic $10,000</p>

<p>MARINA ABRAMOVIC (WHITE COAT) IS A FRIEND AND ASSOCIATE OF HILLARY CLINTON, HER CAMPAIGN MANAGER JOHN PODESTA, TOP AIDE HUMA ABEDIN AND HER PROMOTERS LADY GAGA, JAYZ AND EVEN KATY PERRY AS REVEALED IN EMAILS, PHOTOS AND VIDEOS AND THEIR ATTENDANCE AT #SPIRITCOOKING EVENTS LIKE THESE
<a href="http://m.imgur.com/a/jg2Ii">http://m.imgur.com/a/jg2Ii</a></p>

<p>Dont worry apparently John didnt drink the blood! He just participated! <a href="http://archive.is/YRjUT">http://archive.is/YRjUT</a>  (maybe he wasn&#39;t thristy that day)</p>

<p>Bill clinton is on the plane logs (passenger lists required when a plane flies so if the plane crashes people know who was on it) to got to child prostitute handler jeffrey epstein&#39;s island 20 times. Twenty. <a href="http://imgur.com/gVr2TzY">http://imgur.com/gVr2TzY</a> The island contains a strange temple that cannot easily be associated by appearance to any prominent religion but seems to have pagan statues on its roof <a href="http://imgur.com/6hS2dTI">http://imgur.com/6hS2dTI</a>
John Podesta is Hillary campaign manager and has worked with the Clintons since Bill was President. He communicates often with his brother Tony about Hillary related things.Tony Podesta&#39;s wife bragged about Tony podesta having pictures of naked teenagers on his bedroom walls and she grined when she said party guests were horrified. <a href="https://i.redd.it/i05mcsh5vpvx.png">https://i.redd.it/i05mcsh5vpvx.png</a>
(That same child porn photographer was invited to take portraits of President Barack Obama <a href="http://imgur.com/eVjOD44">http://imgur.com/eVjOD44</a> . Literally some of her photos of naked teenageers could get you arrested in some states. I wont link them. I suggest you not even search for them as it might implicate you in child pornography)
Tony is john podesta&#39;s brother and the person who sent John the email about the spiritcooking dinner with marina abramovic . </p>

<p><a href="http://archive.is/iFRof">http://archive.is/iFRof</a></p>

<p><a href="https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/15893">https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/15893</a>
Tony says marina says hi to john as if they know each other.
As seen in the link 2 above <a href="https://i.redd.it/i05mcsh5vpvx.png">https://i.redd.it/i05mcsh5vpvx.png</a>   Tony has a sculpture hanging from his roof that is a bent man replica of how Serial sex killer jeffrey dalmer arranged the dead bodies of his victims. (Reminder Jeffrey Dalmer drilled the brains of his kidnapped male victims in an attempt to keep them alive so he could continue to have sex with them and they would be zombified).
John Podesta had a painting of human dissection on his officewall in Hillary Clinton&#39;s official campaign headquarters <a href="http://imgur.com/MoLejtM">http://imgur.com/MoLejtM</a>
A huge number of hillary&#39;s most popular and visible celebrity endorsers have gone to marina abramovic&#39;s spiritcooking dinners. Including lady gaga <a href="http://imgur.com/jsGHhoX">http://imgur.com/jsGHhoX</a> <a href="http://imgur.com/jBYvldW">http://imgur.com/jBYvldW</a> and Beyonce&#39;s husband and recent hillary concert host (last night) Jayz who is sharing an intimate moment with her in a photo <a href="http://imgur.com/dVcfFAo">http://imgur.com/dVcfFAo</a> . Beyonce has also been a very visible supporter of Hillary Clinton and long suspected practicioner of the occult based on symbolism she chooses for her videos.</p>

<hr/>

<p>What about Tim Kaine?</p>

<p>He is almost as bad. Certainly as two faced.
Watch Hillary&#39;s two faced VP Tim Kaine go off against illegal immigration when he was runni g for governor. He was even against allowing illegals to congregate indoors! He wanted them kept outside in the cold! Just like Hillary he would say anything that would get him elected at the time he was running for governor. Just like now. Hillary and Kaine are actually extremely racist and two faced. Its their desperate secret.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Looking at the picture of that building, the first impression is that it&#39;s some sort of pool house or beach house. Except it doesn&#39;t look like there&#39;s any pool or beach nearby.</p>

<p>The blue and white stripe pattern on the wall gives you an impression of Egypt. Blue and white are also Israeli colors. No surprise there since Epstein is Jewish.</p>

<p>But the really interesting feature of this building is the gold colored dome on the roof. To me, (if this structure has a religious/occult purpose) it appears to symbolize the rising/setting sun.</p>

<p>There are plenty of stories about how the elite classes of the world secretly practice a solar religion that predates Christianity. Epstein would certainly know some of these people and could easily be one of them himself.</p>

<p>A more mundane explanation would be a huge ego. Epstein sees himself as the Pharaoh of his own little island and built himself a mini-temple to reinforce his fantasies.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It belies their Khazarians roots, look up Khazarian Mafia it&#39;s literally the Ashkenazi Jews (&quot;Illuminati&quot;) plus their Babylonian satanic worship for power over others. We are in a Hegelian dialectic moment right now, a manufactured moment of right vs left. Khazarians worshipped two alternating kings, just like USA. It goes DEEEEEEEP. Also they worship the owl of minerva, the symbol of which which I think is present in the design of that temple from an aerial view</p>

<p>I don&#39;t think it as sinister as people say but it is a little disturbing especially when you consider some of what&#39;s in Tony Podesta art collection, like this is one of his favorite artists <a href="http://www.biljanadjurdjevic.com/Work.html">http://www.biljanadjurdjevic.com/Work.html</a> I ask you too look at all of the art there. It is some very strange and anxiety inducing art of children, animals and surgery/dissection.  John Podesta also has a piece that looks like a man on a table being dissected/eaten by 2 other men (its #6 in the gallery)  <a href="http://www.politico.com/gallery/2015/07/inside-hillarys-campaign-headquarters-210684?slide=6">http://www.politico.com/gallery/2015/07/inside-hillarys-campaign-headquarters-210684?slide=6</a></p>

<p>Another article where he talk about art and says &quot;I don&#39;t know why it is, but I have artworks where the women have no heads.&quot; 
<a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A43480-2004Sep22.html">http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A43480-2004Sep22.html</a></p>

<p>If you look up the Podesta&#39;a art collection they have many other pieces that have to do with dissecting bodies etc</p>

<p>To me the Podestas just seem really rich and out of touch.  If art is a window to soul, I think we can all look at this art and feel that there is something at the very least unpleasant.  But maybe he just enjoys a dark aesthetic.  Some of the artist he likes do seem interesting to me.</p>

<p>Oh yeah the spirit cooking thing does at least refer to an actual art piece by the person who invited the Podesta brothers over for dinner, it may have been a joke but here is the reference to the joke <a href="https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=g9ys-Lfu4Sc">https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=g9ys-Lfu4Sc</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>It doesn&#39;t.  These posts rely on people reading the summary, accepting its narrative, and upvoting without reading the links.</p>

<p>Like this for example:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Even more disturbing, we uncovered an email in Wikileaks where they are literally pricing how much it costs to transport children</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If you think about it, of course an organization with a stated goal of transporting children to be adopted by Christians will price out how much it costs to transport children as part of its donation request. Or just accept that it&#39;s &quot;disturbing&quot; and move on.</p>

<p>Or:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Huma Abedin was constantly forwarding Hillary articles on this woman&#39;s organization</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Because when Americans do illegal things in a foreign country with the potential to harm diplomatic relations with that country, the State Department shouldn&#39;t be paying attention to it?</p>
