        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>For about two or three days after the election, <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a> seemed like it was completely rid of CTR and the hate for HRC and the DNC resurfaced. The general idea behind the average post was that HRC failed miserably, that the people need to take the DNC back, and that Sanders had a real shot at beating Trump and the DNC took that away from everyone.</p>

<p>Then it started again. Every post is a heaping pile of Trump-bashing fear-mongering shit. The blame is being entirely shifted from Clinton and the DNC to alt-right media outlets and &quot;fake&quot; news websites.</p>

<p>What&#39;s the end goal behind the renewed paid trolling efforts on <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a>? I mean... It has to be paid trolling, right? The fact that the sub went back to normal for a few days makes me think it probably is, but I&#39;m honestly not even entirely sure anymore. I guess it&#39;s entirely possible that people really have their heads that deep up their asses.</p>

<p>If we&#39;re back to paid trolling on <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a> though, what are they hoping to accomplish? Are they just pushing the &quot;fake&quot; news crap to actually get people behind the idea of having google and other web giants act as gatekeepers for what&#39;s true and what isn&#39;t?</p>

<p>I&#39;m just curious to hear other people&#39;s points of view on the situation.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve been following Voat from the start, and am willing to contribute, and maybe some people can toss a few bucks my way. They built their site on  MS tech (Hail Satan - Bill Gates), rather than, open source, us devs work on. Big red flag.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>I agree. That is the catch 22 as a dev. P2p is great an all, but needs people to host content. That content could be illegal. &quot;Encrypted&quot;, sure, but still illegal, if de-crypted. And the forces against us are powerful.. </p>

<p>I&#39;m trying man, as a &quot;conspiracy theorists&quot; and web dev/designer.... But shit.... The deck is stacked against us all..</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ugh that&#39;s sad they built on M$ stack. I&#39;m a dev too and would love to work on something that matters.</p>

<p>What if said P2P system refused to directly serve any images or video? Liability for illegal porn would maybe then shift to imgur, etc.</p>

<p>I say no encryption, the purpose would be permanent content rather than secret content. It does not need to provide illegal content.</p>

<p>I&#39;m sure something is out there or being written. I guess I&#39;m proposing something similar to the failed Diaspora project, but for a reddit clone not for social media.</p>

<p>There&#39;s so much more on this:</p>

<ul>
<li>Explains constant Trump bashing</li>
<li>3 republicans already said they wouldnt give trump their vote</li>
<li>Soros paying rioters</li>
<li>Want electors to feel the need to switch from trump</li>
<li>4m people signed petition to have electoral college not vote for trump</li>

But I also think they will fail just as the NeverTrump movement failed at the RNC convention. Another angle to consider is the Clintons/Obama are trying to secure their freedom. They don&#39;t want Trump to reopen investigations once in power. This stuff is probably how they are putting pressure on.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>r/politics should be non-biased, but instead it&#39;s become this liberal echo chamber for pussies to cry over spilt milk. The worst part is that because of r/politics,  the right winged asshats created r/the_donald, a living, breathing, flaming pile of circlejerking dog shit. </p>

<p>I have retreated to r/conspiracy because I&#39;m not sure where else to go. I miss the Reddit that I used to know.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think the new, unfortunate reality is polarized media. TPTB know the gig is up when it comes to their act of pretending to be neutral... so they&#39;ve switched gears and are claiming, &quot;we&#39;re good news, and they&#39;re fake news.&quot; </p>

<p>I&#39;m actually happy they&#39;re making it so damn obvious because it&#39;s scarier when they try being subtle. Slowly, incrementally censoring shit until you don&#39;t know if it&#39;s real or you&#39;re being paranoid.</p>

<p>In this case, half the voter bloc supported a candidate loathed by the usual media outlets. Then there&#39;s half of the Dems who supported Sanders and noticed how badly the media was screwing over their candidate. So do they really think that sizable a population is just going to say, &quot;oh, okay, thanks for sheltering me from those evil websites?&quot; Hah, no. </p>

<p>At first I was deeply concerned about <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a> being censored because I thought it was effective. But now that I&#39;ve seen so many people see through the bullshit, I&#39;m sort of welcoming it because it hastens the alternative--be it a flight to subs like ours, or the advent of a new site altogether a la Digg style. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Simple. <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a> is the Democrat&#39;s most populous subreddit. In the few days after the elections they were all too busy crying/drinking/protesting/rioting and the Republicans had fun in there while they were recuperating. Things have simply gone back to normal. </p>

<p>Reddit 101.</p>

<p>Despite that, you&#39;ll still have propagandists attacking Trump critics with cries of &quot;CTR!1!&quot; despite that being hilariously irrational.</p>
