<p>Now we are talking about carbon market, but there is another side of this and that is the Carbon Tax. How about the EU&#39;s proposal to spend $7 Trillion on programs that will do virtually nothing. <a href="http://www.slate.com/articles/health_and_science/project_syndicate/2013/11/climate_change_the_eu_wants_to_spend_7_trillion_on_projects_that_will_barely.html">http://www.slate.com/articles/health_and_science/project_syndicate/2013/11/climate_change_the_eu_wants_to_spend_7_trillion_on_projects_that_will_barely.html</a></p>

<p>Then we have the Paris talks from last year which were estimated to cost... wait for it.... 1.5 Trillion a year. <a href="http://wattsupwiththat.com/2015/11/10/lomborg-paris-climate-pact-will-reduce-temperature-increase-by-the-end-of-the-century-by-a-whopping-0-05c/">http://wattsupwiththat.com/2015/11/10/lomborg-paris-climate-pact-will-reduce-temperature-increase-by-the-end-of-the-century-by-a-whopping-0-05c/</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>there&#39;s alot of money in denying climate change aswell . I don&#39;t think the fossil fuel industry would take this lying down they are tptb.  Ofcourse they would make fail policies that do nothing, then when they fail they can claim climate change is false. Fossil fuel industry is a main contributor to political parties on both sides. They have many shills working for them spreading disinformation.  I think you need to believe in the consensus of the scientific community. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think the main issue is that we need to see climate change as a non-partizan issue (based on fact). The solutions to climate change should be discussed in a series of transparent and public debates made by scientists, not politicians.</p>

<p>And we need a renewables push on a municipal/decentralized scale ASAP. This is the one thing politicians need to mandate, the rest should be left to people who know what they&#39;re talking about.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Agree  however i  don&#39;t think the general public has the mental capacity to understand the debates.  I also think the politicians  are to corrupt to be trusted on important issues, their campaigns are bigly funded by the fossil fuel industrial  complexes.  On a lighter note i seen a post on Elon Musk&#39;s new solar roof that is cheaper than a standard roof, if this is the case decentralization  of the grid would make economic sense . Change happens at grass roots and i think climate change denying should be challenged when possible. </p>

<p>Abso-duckin-lutely! The <em>one</em> thing that is 100% certain is that global warming/climate change is a fact. </p>

<p>My point was that I don&#39;t trust the &quot;global initiative&quot; efforts as much, because they&#39;re taking a way too centralized approach. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This year, 2016, has been the hottest year on record and temperatures are trending upwards and have been for quite some time. This can be independently confirmed from a multitude of sources. There are other evidences of problems like rising water levels and melting glaciers that can be independently confirmed. There is no doubt that climate change is happening and there is ample evidence suggesting that human actions are causing or exasperating it. </p>

<p>The existence of business interests who seek to profit from the transition away from environment-damaging fossil fuels is not evidence of deception. The world needs to move away from energy sources which damage the planet and because of this great interest in investing in renewable resources, there is profit to be made in the transition. And the transition away from fossil fuels MUST cost a lot of money. Or do you think we should be able to move away from oil without spending money investing in other alternatives? You&#39;re really suggesting that there is deception because people who work with money tell you that it&#39;s going to cost a lot of money to build brand new societal infrastructure and dismantle an old one? Of course it&#39;ll cost a lot of money to move from one primary dirty energy source into many different renewable ones! </p>
