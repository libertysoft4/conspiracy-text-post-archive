<p>Look at yesterday&#39;s top posts. </p>

<p>One is a <em>self post</em> made by a 37 day old account that currently has 6,000 upvotes. Maybe 10,000 votes total. On a sub that has at any given moment 1,500 users online. </p>

<p>Two is a link about Assange and google. It has 500 upvotes or maybe 1,000 total. A normal vote distribution for this sub. </p>

<p>The Trump post is so obviously misdirection. TPTB are legitimately scared. They can not read Trump or the American people at the moment. They are slowly but surely losing control. </p>

<p>I listen to a podcast called No Agenda. Over the past year a similar phenomenon happened. The podcast is basically two dudes who deconstruct the news media, expose bias and lies and <strong>search for truth</strong>. During the campaign it was almost impossible to believe they didn&#39;t support Trump. Even if they constantly reminded people they did not. By deconstructing the news (TPTB) they seemed like Trump supporters. Simply because TPTB spent an insane amount of effort to demonize Trump. </p>

<p>The same thing is happening here. Its a movement against TPTB. How often do you see dissenting opinions on Assange or Snowden? I know they exist but they are a tiny minority because from what we can tell they are fighting TPTB. The same goes for Trump. </p>

<p>There is no bias from Trump. It is not Trump supporters taking over <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>. We just potentially have a new champion. I feel more hopeful than ever before. I hope this board can regain some control and see that the Trump movement is one of truth. </p>

<p>Godspeed <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>Right, and the same thing is happening here in a different form. This sub prides itself on uncovering corruption and conspiracy. We are trained not to trust politicians and the elite. But as much as this sub has dug all we find is the people fighting trump are the conspirators and Trump himself is clean. The top post yesterday (still top post but nothing strange about that) is the same as the producers complaining the guys are pro trump. They are confused people. Some people refuse to accept the possibility that the sub hasn&#39;t changed, isnt biased, and is not pro trump. It is and has always been pro truth. Just like No Agenda. </p>

<p>Those bonds are devaluing as we speak selling out, it means printing, and it puts a spike in inflation. They aren&#39;t all localized it has cost the Euro as well due to partnerships, but the fact it is costing the deficit and if that trend continues at that rate, oh boy!</p>

<p>The disinformation that hit has made the gullible lick eating cramming that bullshit down their throats later regurgitating it back up spewing it into their misconstrued fantasies that were simply misinformed used for promoting an agenda. </p>

<p>I am curious what that agenda is, because it seems like a succession of pieces playing out towards a strategy, and I left with the same feeling that isn&#39;t going to turn out well no matter what. How has history always shaped from here, and perish those thoughts.</p>

<p>You are right, what do I care, when I really don&#39;t. The kids can have all their jokes, although it seems like they will only bounce back them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>But it doesn&#39;t mean anything, it&#39;s just an attempt to use ad hominem to invalidate a person&#39;s argument instead of actually addressing it. </p>

<p>I could point out your account being four months old, with infrequent and or even sporadic activity, with no pattern of participation except for you becoming relatively active in the past few days with pizzagate. And then, out of nowhere, you make this post in response to the post that suggests this sub has been Trump-dominated for months, almost as if the post triggered your damage control. Sounds like the behavior of a shill account to me, yo. </p>

<p>The first post in the positive that even begins to criticize Trump after several months of not a bad word against him (go ahead, you can check, feel free to post anything from before the election that was anti trump and not downvoted to hell) and you think CTR just decided to take over days after the election is over? <em>&quot;We lost, might as well take over <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> now.&quot;</em></p>

<p>And not only do you disagree with the idea that this sub has been pro-Trump in your post, at the end of your post you&#39;re heralding him as a champion, which is exactly what that post was against. </p>

<p>But I don&#39;t really care about any of that, I&#39;m just tired of seeing people trying to use as hominems to distract from arguments. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Damage control? Lol he is President elect bud. Its over, TPTB lost. They are in scramble mode trying to cover up pizzagate and the foundation. Think what you want, I wont stop you. I saw this same pattern happen with No Agenda. Its confusing for skeptical people. Why does everything seem pro trump??? Why is it the more we dig the more dirt we find on one side and not the other? Why does it feel like Trump is controlling the narrative when its obvious the other side <em>is actually trying to control the narrative</em>? Its because truth knows no master and the side of truth is finally winning. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hahahaha. This is why gullible people are freaking gullible and this is why they troll the internet eating crap spewing it back up, literally vomiting their fears and fantasies accusing everybody else of being their mistrust. And all this website does is fan their hates. This media is troll.com look at its stinking logo of a troll, look at how it manipulates you. It even says it is manipulated on its freaking login, the best votes are promoted the most, and that is simply a checksum value that whatever which ever fascist has been employed from being in a position too usurp into an agenda, or some other dimwitted troll has press ganged their little caverns to do the same. There is no karma here when this media hasn&#39;t even got basic human conversation, conversation which there is no right and wrong answer only different views that should create a common understanding of each other. Far from it on troll.com.</p>

<p>What has my time spent on this atrocity got anything to do with me having a view on what is happening in the world today? Why would I be a shill. I am not even American and have absolutely no desire to be, you guys look so stupid right now that the rest of the world is literally in spasms.</p>
