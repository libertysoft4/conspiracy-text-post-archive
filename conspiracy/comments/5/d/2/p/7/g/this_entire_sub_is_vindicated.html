    <div class="md"><p>The misprojection of the election results were a product of political correctness where no one wanted to come out a say they&#39;re voting Trump.   It&#39;s the same phenomenon that&#39;s happening to Obama&#39;s approval rating.   No one wants to come out and say that a black president is doing a bad job.   It is ludicrous for him to have nearly 60% rating when midterm elections overwhelmingly went Republican and they even lost the white house while Rep kept control of Congress.   It&#39;s all a sham.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The dishonest behaviour of the polling organisations, and their complicity with the Clinton team is a major conspiracy of this election (and Brexit for that matter). People don&#39;t like to vote for a loser, so if the polls always put your guy behind, that can dampen turnout, and the compliant pollsters went to some effort to ensure Clinton always appeared to be in the lead, even if that meant some obvious tweaking of the data. </p>

<p>A couple of weeks before the election, they went full retard and put Clinton ahead by a ludicrous 11% - possibly in an attempt to kill off the Trump challenge for good - but it didn&#39;t work. Instead, as election day loomed the pollsters realised their reputation would be trashed unless they could bring down Clinton&#39;s &quot;lead&quot; to something plausibly deniable when she lost. Fortunately, (or by design?) Comey&#39;s brief re-activation of the email enquiry gave the pollsters the excuse to slash Hillary&#39;s fake poll lead without too many questions being asked. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>huh?</p>

<p>I know it&#39;s kneejerk virtue-signalling to be &#39;fair and balanced&#39;...but no, you -cannot- always say that &#39;well, both sides are equally X&#39;.  e.g. &#39;bad&#39;.</p>

<p>Let&#39;s see...we&#39;ve got the MSM narrative....blatantly biased...that&#39;s one side....and the &#39;other&#39; side is...what?  Trump HQ presumably?  lol.  What &#39;misinformation&#39; are they outputting?  They hardly say anything.  Hell, they&#39;ve been criticized for not returning the lying-media&#39;s phone-calls! lol</p>

<p>There&#39;s only ONE side on MSM...the shadow-gov&#39;s side.  It&#39;s blatantly obvious that the MSM is &#39;feeding&#39; the riots...whipping them up...along with a thousand oh-so-hip regurgitator-sites like Slate, TPM, Huffpoo etc..</p>

<p>Christ, just look down the list of thread-titles (headlines) at r/politics !  99% of them are -designed- to goad the brainwashed conformists to even greater mouth-frothing madness.</p>

<p>And now the MSM joins with the oh-so-hip tech firms like Google, FB, et al, to demonize, censor, and eradicate indie-media that doesn&#39;t toe the approved narrative.  I.e., Huff-poo gets a free ride, while Zerohedge is blocked/banned/ruined.</p>

<p>No, the amount of &#39;misinformation&#39; is NOT great from &#39;both sides&#39;.  Just from one &#39;side&#39;...the side of the powerful and corrupt...the establishment/MSM/SJW narrative &#39;side&#39;.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The corruption of the left has been exposed. We have seen the mainstream media blatantly and arrogantly forcing one candidate down our throats. We watched as the Democratic Party torpedoed a more popular candidate in favor of their chosen nominee. Lies from the president, the sec of state and the entire administration have been uncovered. All of these things supported by irrefutable evidence. It is as if a giant spotlight has been turned on and directed right at the party that half the country blindly supports.</p>

<p>What you should be asking yourself, is who is holding that light? Is it a coincidence that all of this damning information has suddenly been uncovered and proven that the corruption we have all been warning about and fighting against actually exists? </p>

<p>I find it more likely that what we are actually seeing is the destruction of the credibility of one choice so that the other choice will seem virtuous and right. We are being shown a fairy tale in which the corrupt establishment of the elite has been exposed and the people have chosen a new leader against all odds whom will save us from the traitors and cut out the cancer in our government.</p>

<p>This is the same story they told the left 8 years ago to put them to sleep. The white knight is riding to the White House to save &#39;murica. Everything is ok now... </p>

<p>Why would the media expose crimes that it was implicit in commiting? Why would the media give so much time to a man it supposedly hated, when ignoring other candidates had destroyed their campaigns? Why would the so called &#39;savior&#39; be a friend of the establishment&#39;s candidate and have donated to her campaigns in the past? </p>

<p>The interests that control this country are not elected. We elect the puppets, not the puppeteer. </p>

<p>I think I started to change direction once John Kerry told Equador to cut off Assanges internet at the Embassy, and the raid on the embassy and how nobody else was reporting it but I saw it first on here.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>John Kerry is a menace to society and should have not been allowed to be Secretary of State. J.K.&#39;s character was first brought into question when a university student asked him too many questions and was body slammed, choked and tazered while John Kerry watched and said or did nothing to stop it.</p>

<p>Knowing that John Kerry would cut off or raid the Ecuadorean Embassy is not at all surprising from John Kerry. It reassures assumptions about his character. Perhaps John Kerry signaled the university student to be taken down because he didn&#39;t like the questions: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QkkLUP-gm4Q">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QkkLUP-gm4Q</a></p>

<p>When I first watched about the Collateral Murder leaked video my thought wasn&#39;t that a news organization should be raided or a person exiled and killed. My thought was pride that I lived in a place where we could know that information and that the people in power needed to tread lightly. The Obama response has not and cannot and will not destroy leaking. What it did destroy was peoples&#39; respect for Obama or the US Government. The election of Trump is one small part of returning America back to its entrepreneurs.</p>

Then I found out many of the 33 levels are named after Mt. Zion and rebuilding the Temple of Solomon. Then I found out about modern Zionism and its relationship to the Rothschild Family and Israel.

<p>A 676 flies at 525~ mph while cruising, a bullet flies at 1,700 mph. So, that&#39;s third the speed. </p>

<p>But, a 676 weighs 395,000 pounds.</p>

<p>Seems simple to me, with that weight and speed, and the structure of the 676 and the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=814rcm4KC5w">angle it went through</a> it would easily bend steel.</p>

<p>Now, if you can make a easily <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXeCYmAQg6U">melt iron at home</a> I don&#39;t want to imagine the temperature it was inside a small place with high winds, flaming jet fuel, molten steel and a lot of burning material.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>But Mercer’s ties to Trump go beyond Super PAC donations. In 2011, the conservative billionaire provided a $10 million lifeline to a floundering Breitbart News. The site has since exploded from its niche on the paranoid right to mainstream prominence; in August, Breitbart CEO and Trump Svengali Steve Bannon took over managing the Donald’s campaign. Bannon is reportedly “tied at the hip” to Mercer daughter and cookie entrepreneur Rebekah Mercer, who has emerged as the family’s political power player.</p>

<p>Rebekah Mercer, whose wealthy family has sought for years to reshape conservative politics with a populist, anti-establishment message, was named to President-Elect Donald Trump’s transition team.</p>

<p>Mercer, the 42-year-old daughter of New York hedge-fund manager Robert Mercer, will serve as one of 16 members of the team’s executive committee, the group said in a statement Friday. It’s a sign of how the Mercers’ longstanding effort to influence the direction of the Republican Party is paying off.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>And instead of ending the much-derided cronyism, Trump is looking to reward those sycophantic toadies who supported him regardless of their lack of skill, intelligence or previous legal issues. Nowhere is this more glaring than in the case of Chris Christie. Christie&#39;s name appears as a possibility for Attorney General and three secretary positions: Homeland Security, Interior and Commerce.  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Chris &quot;Never Met a Donut I Didn&#39;t Eat&quot; Christie, double check.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Pam Bondi, Florida AG, is actually named by insiders as having a possible place as Attorney General of the United States as well. Yes, that Pam Bondi. The one who is embroiled in a pay for play scandal with Trump himself.

Those allegations may make it hard to get her appointed, though.</p>

<p>I mean, seriously.  It&#39;s a who&#39;s-who of insiders, billionaire elites (and their children), lobbyists, and political professionals...you know, just like every other Democratic and Republican cabinet ever.  If you think they&#39;ll be bowing to his wishes any more than they would to any other politician, you&#39;re delusional.  He did a song and dance and baited the hooks, you&#39;re just one of the millions of marks that bought it.  The only difference between Shillary and Trump is the specific billionaires that own them and the specific laws they&#39;ve broken to Fuck the working class of this country.  Otherwise they&#39;re both criminal elites sucking off the middle class teat.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>i&#39;m not sure about this spirit cooking thing -- but on first glance Id say it is a planted story. the thing about these conspiracies is there are A LOT of planted conspiracies. planted by the CIA (maybe) or whoever -- somebody like the CIA. they &quot;leak&quot; images, stories, etc. and it&#39;s like candy for the people who are just starting to realize all is not as it seems. but ---- unfortunately it&#39;s a jungle out there of real conspiracy and planted conspiracy. I&#39;d say Edward Snoeden and Wikileaks are very likely planted. meant to confuse, subterfuge and derail your research. but you shouldn&#39;t take my word for it -- everything deserves it&#39;s own vetting -- but just know some conspiracies are there to detract your attention from more real realizations. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s good advice, and that&#39;s exactly what I had to do.  It was very overwhelming at first, especially since I was the only one out of anyone I knew who was digging into this.  My friends mostly dismissed it and told me that they only reason they weren&#39;t calling a mental hospital for me, was because they knew I was a rational person who didn&#39;t just make shit up.</p>

<p>I had to give it a rest after about 3 weeks of barely sleeping (3 hrs a night) and reading nonstop.  </p>

<p>I have since been able to show my friends enough information to where they are all believers that something really messed up is going on, and that our government is lying to us.  Once people understand that, it becomes much easier to grasp the rest of it.</p>

<p>So, at least now I don&#39;t feel crazy and alone, just slightly crazy. :)</p>

<p>Don&#39;t let some of the rough editing and slightly lower budget feel to some of the post production elements turn you off, as it&#39;s the most comprehensive critique of all aspects of that terrible day in one place that I have seen.</p>

<p>Kevin orders cheese pizza, leaves a sign on the door that says &quot;backdoor please&quot;, pizza guy arrives and rams into a statue of a little boy.</p>

<p>Kevin&#39;s actor grew up and is now in a band called the Pizza underground</p>

<p>I just think home alone is really about rape, and the two bandits are actually interested in Kevin and not the house. Even the dialogue the scene immediately before the pizza delivery is his brother saying he doesnt care that he is &quot;getting it in the butt&quot;</p>

<p>Also pizza place was called Lil Nero&#39;s, and their catchphrase was &quot;No Fiddlin Around&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>imo, the statue looks more like a miniature bugler or mailman than a little boy. Also, Little Nero&#39;s is a parody of Little Caesar&#39;s and &quot;No fiddlin&#39; around&quot; is likely a reference to the saying that Nero fiddled (played music) while Rome burned. Seems to me that they&#39;re all just details that could be interpreted as related to pedophilia but probably not.</p>

<p>That&#39;s the article that was posted on this sub, saying that leftists jewish students painted the swastika. It links this site as its source:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.thejewishweek.com/news/national/students-charged-painting-swastikas-trump-campus-chapel">http://www.thejewishweek.com/news/national/students-charged-painting-swastikas-trump-campus-chapel</a></p>

<p>Nowhere on that site does it mention the students being jewish or leftists. It&#39;s right there in the article and this sub still upvoted it to the front page</p>

Amongst other consequences, like the continued never ending war and industrialized military complex taking over america. The fall of many world governments and the ever expanding reach of the world bank. Terrorists.  Terror. Terrorists.  Terror. Jihad terrorists. Terrorists. Terrorists. That was shoved down Americans throats for years. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks a nice post!! 9/11 was my first eye opener, a couple years ago. I gotta say I&#39;m still realizing things about that day, &#39;no planes&#39; and &#39;no floors&#39; seemed like &quot;too far&quot; to me for a long time. but there came a point I realized &quot;inside job&quot; isn&#39;t even a full explanation here -- some, or perhaps a great deal, of what we think we witnesses  that day was theatrics, in fact a lot of the identities of the victims seem to be falsified. I don&#39;t know if you&#39;ve dared to go to those depths yet -- but there is so much to realize about 9/11, even further down than inside job -- </p>

<p>anyway, nice post!!!!!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>thats cool you tried it, </p>

<p>the first time I looked at it I felt embarrassed for myself, I came out to the living room , told my bf I&#39;ve finally gone too far on the internet and he was like : good. Im glad you realized, lets watch TV. </p>

<p>but then it just bugged me, that what i had seen was still something i was thinking about, so I watched a little more a few days later, it took me months of just pondering and being in disbelief that I was pondering this -- and research - and field trips --- to realize --- HS!!! the globe can not be true, Im not embarrassed any more. the truth is more powerful than social acceptance. </p>

<p>in my opinion there is so much to question at once - I think when you first look into it sometimes it just feels like to take any part of it it&#39;s like pulling a stone out of a wall and the whole thing could come tumbling down. and you have to build up preparedness to have further curiosity. </p>

<p>but to each their own. we all have to figure stuff out in a manner that is personally vetted by ourselves, </p>

<p>(my BF now knows it&#39;s flat too -- because I spent the next few months, after I realized it for myself explaining it to him.: ) </p>
