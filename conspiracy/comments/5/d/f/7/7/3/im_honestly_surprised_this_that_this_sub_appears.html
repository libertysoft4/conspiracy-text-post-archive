<p>What, did you all swallow the bullshit that Al Gore sold in an inconvenient truth? Seriously? Do you guys recall that, in it he claimed that the ice caps would melt by 2014? Let me give ya&#39;all a wake-up call...</p>

<p>Seriously, <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/jamestaylor/2015/05/19/updated-nasa-data-polar-ice-not-receding-after-all/#6f2f109a32da">you thought</a> that the <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2415191/And-global-COOLING-Return-Arctic-ice-cap-grows-29-year.html">polar ice caps are melting?</a></p>

<p>I give you <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jan/03/antarctica-ice-trapped-academik-shokalskiy-climate-change">climate researchers who went in search of what &quot;little&quot; ice was left in the Antarctic, but instead were greeted with <strong>TOO MUCH ICE</strong></a></p>

<p>Oh you were worried about the <a href="http://jennifermarohasy.com/2008/11/the-absurdity-of-a-reliable-average-global-surface-temperature/">&quot;global average temperature&quot;</a> (&lt;- the biggest load of a bullshit concept I&#39;ve ever seen) having a disturbingly rising trend? <a href="http://www.climatedepot.com/2015/11/04/no-global-warming-at-all-for-18-years-9-months-a-new-record-the-pause-lengthens-again-just-in-time-for-un-summit-in-paris/">Worry not, it seems we&#39;ve had <strong>no</strong> <del>Global Warming</del> <del>Global Cooling</del> Climate Change for the past 19+ years... (Kinda makes you wonder why they called it <del>global cooling</del>, <del>global warming</del>, climate change in the first place...)</a></p>

<p>Nah, you guys were probably concerned about the polar bears going extinct... <a href="http://www.thegwpf.com/new-survey-record-high-numbers-of-polar-bears/">Seems you didn&#39;t get the memo that their population seems to have hit record high levels</a></p>

<p>The <del>science</del> pseudoscience of <del>Global Warming</del> <del>Global Cooling</del> Climate Change is so unbelievably retarded, it can be summed up wonderfully by one of my favorite independent reporters, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=huKY5DzrcLI">James Corbett</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Karl Popper famously said, “A theory that explains everything explains nothing.” So what do you make of the theory that catastrophic manmade CO2-driven “climate change” can account for harsher winters and lighter winters, more snow and less snow, droughts and floods, more hurricanes and less hurricanes, more rain and less rain, more malaria and less malaria, saltier seas and less salty seas, Antarctica ice melting and Antarctic ice gaining and dozens of other contradictions? Popper gave a name to “theories” like this: pseudoscience.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>&quot;But global average temperature keeps rising as we dump more CO2 in the atmosphere!!11!one1!&quot; <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/jamestaylor/2013/03/06/as-carbon-dioxide-levels-continue-to-rise-global-temperatures-are-not-following-suit/#31d4ed412567">No it fucking doesn&#39;t. Many Al Gore apologists have tried to cover this up, but you all should know as well as I do, that the truth cannot be kept hidden forever</a></p>

<p>&quot;B-b-but, BUT MUH CARBON TAX!&quot; Oh you mean <a href="http://thetyee.ca/Opinion/2016/03/08/BC-Carbon-Tax-Failure/">that shitshow of an industry</a> that&#39;s <a href="http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/news/opinion/carbon-tax-exposed-as-a-corrupt-fraud/story-e6frezz0-1226185058528">causing a major economic</a> and <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/earth/energy/12022964/Emission-impossible-as-EU-fails-to-police-main-anti-pollution-scheme.html">political nightmare resulting in billions worth of losses</a>, <a href="http://www.torontosun.com/2015/12/16/canadas-carbon-pricing-is-a-fraud">already proving a massive failure</a> and stifling economic progress in third-world countries?

<p>&quot;Hey, 97% of scientists and climatologists have unanimously agreed that man-made <del>Global Warming</del> <del>Global Cooling</del> Climate Change is real. Who dafuq do you think you are?&quot; </p>

<p>...Huh? How have you people not, as of yet, realized how this 97% consensus is a <a href="http://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052702303480304579578462813553136">complete myth</a>?? <a href="http://www.nationalreview.com/article/425232/97-percent-solution-ian-tuttle">A total fabrication</a>, this <del>Global Warming</del> <del>Global Cooling</del> Climate Change &quot;groupthink&quot;, rightly termed by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GujLcfdovE8">Dr. Judith Curry, one of the most qualified Climatologists I have consulted</a>, is nothing short of an insult in the scientific community.</p>

<p>&quot;Okay fine, I can get behind the idea that the 97% figure is a myth. What about the mountain of data collected by climatologists and scientists which indicate human activity as the primary cause of <del>Global Warming</del> <del>Global Cooling</del> Climate Change?&quot; Oh, you mean <a href="https://www.corbettreport.com/lies-damned-lies-and-global-warming-statistics/">layers and layers of lies, cover-ups, and truncated charts &amp; statistics (James Corbett rightly refers to this as Lies, Damned Lies and Global Warming Statistics)</a>? Perhaps you meant <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/jamestaylor/2011/11/23/climategate-2-0-new-e-mails-rock-the-global-warming-debate/#3b72f7d3988d">ClimateGate, a scandal that exposed email exchanges among several leading climate researchers, wherein they conspired to <del>tamper with</del> &quot;adjust&quot; the data to suit their needs</a>?</p>

<p>&quot;So you&#39;re saying we shouldn&#39;t do anything about our climate? That we should let it rot to hell??!!&quot; Not at all. Stopping pollution is a great idea. Advancing forward from dependency on fossil fuels has fantastic prospects. But to steer public opinion using fear-mongering over a non-existent threat of a world-wide catastrophe is absolutely reprehensible in my eyes, and to capitalize on the result that follows, e.g. economic and trade policies that further stifle growth of industry in developing nations and smaller companies in developed countries should be a crime against humanity. </p>

<p>We all deserve the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the absolute truth, which in this case is that we understand VERY little about how our climate changes, and that we often ignore much bigger drivers of our climate: Solar Flares, tilt of the Earth&#39;s axis w.r.t. to the Sun (Haven&#39;t researched much on this one, heard it from my friend who&#39;s into Astrophysics, just sayin...), orbital variations in the Earth&#39;s distance from the Sun, to name a few.</p>

<p>Please people, do not fall for this scam known as <del>Global Warming</del> <del>Global Cooling</del> Climate Change. Research, research RESEARCH!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>How can you feel so sure of yourself when you&#39;re literally on the side of industry shills with billions to lose? Did you know the fossil fuels industry you support knew about climate change before most climate scientists and said nothing?</p>

<p><a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/exxon-knew-about-climate-change-almost-40-years-ago/">https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/exxon-knew-about-climate-change-almost-40-years-ago/</a></p>

<p>Did you know that before this enormous agreement on climate science, scientists who decided to pursue the truth had their lives and careers ruined by constant lawsuits by the companies you support?</p>

<p>Let me see, a group of truth-seeking individuals fighting against corporate tyranny vs. the position of industry shills who now invest in dwindling water reserves and seek to undermine scientists with bogus studies and media control. </p>

<p>Only recently did media and politicians actually admit that it even exists so make no mistake, these scientists were true conspiracy theorists who succeeded in getting a message out against the establishment and of course you want to shit all over them.</p>

<p>By the way, Carbon Tax isn&#39;t the solution suggested by climate scientists, it&#39;s the non-solution suggested by shitty politicians. You also mentioned Climategate, which is an absolute joke &#39;controversy&#39; where some Scientists in a large discussion wanted to use PR to convince people that climate change is real and to get everyone using the same terminology.</p>

<p>Luckily instead of intentionally seeking people out to confirm your bias...</p>

<p>You can do the right thing and question scientists at length about your theories. There are still plenty of science redditors and lecturers willing to waste their personal time explaining their view.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>To be fair, your entire post only presents one side of the argument, and it <em>is</em> the same argument that the fossil fuel industry are making.

<p>If you had presented full research on every side of the argument instead of &quot;heard it from my friend who&#39;s into Astrophysics, just sayin...&quot;, then people may be more inclined to take you seriously. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Here is the problem as I see it:</p>

<p>We know that certain industries are going to manipulate their studies to prove their case against AGW because, we admit, they will profit from it.</p>

<p>We do not acknowledge that certain other industries are going to manipulate their studies to prove their case for global warming because they will profit from it.  We tend to attribute this side of the argument to &quot;good vibes&quot;.. feels.. whatever.</p>

<p>So everyone is already starting from a skewed viewpoint on the issue.  </p>

<p>My one big issue that I see regularly from the &quot;pro&quot;AGW crowd is that they do a lot of &quot;adjusting&quot; of their data.  I have never once in my life seen where it is acceptable to adjust your data from a test.  If you do that, then it means your test doesn&#39;t work and is completely invalid.  Source:  I&#39;m a scientist.</p>

<p>Beyond that, the issue is so politicized and non-empirical that it makes it impossible to have a rational discussion about it.</p>

I watch a lot of international financial news, and every time they show something in China, I get to look at live shots of what happens when you burn shit-tons of coal.

I think we are advanced enough of a species not to have to breathe that shit in everyday. There are parts of the US that are getting pretty bad.
I do think the elite are using the effects of pollution to their own means, and we should strive to not be manipulated by them, but for fucks sake, not in the form of continuing to pollute this awesome, rare, jewel-of-a-planet that we are lucky enough to live on. I don&#39;t think one has to be a hippie to appreciate this place, especially since it&#39;s all we have &amp; we are making it nastier everyday.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Beautifully put. Carbon tax is controversial and deserves objective analysis. And we can get into a pissing match over the effects of CO2 until we&#39;re blue in the face but the reality is in the meantime industry is treating the planet like a $2 hooker. The planet is being stripped of its essential ecosystems and species are being demolished. We need to start working to reverse the undeniable truth that industry is committing environmental genocide, commonly for the benefit of a few powerful corporations. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I fully agree. We actually have sustainable measures available to us to, at the very least, curtail the pollution, e.g. installing electrostatic precipitators in reactor end turbine exhausts (whether the authorities follow through with their implementation is another matter...) .

    <div class="md"><p>I agree with this and I think trump was trying to highlight this in that infamous tweet he sent out. There is currently no climate change deal in discussion that would force regulations onto china via trade agreements. The current Paris deal is only European countries and the US that forces stricter regulations on manufacturing via trade agreements amongst the countries. No one is going out of there way to force china to regulate the amount of pollution they are dumping via trade deals.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Forget &quot;global warming/climate change &quot; then if it&#39;s so controversial. Environmental destruction is real and needs to stop. Humans as a species need to take care of what&#39;s In front of us, and that is environmental atrocities. Regardless of how the co2/temperature debate shakes out we need to preserve and restore earth&#39;s life supporting ecosystems. </p>

<p>We can make a difference simply by abolishing all clear cutting of the Amazon/Congo and start greening deserted landscapes and increase earth&#39;s vegetation. Regardless of climate issues the earth is losing its freshwater to the sea and biodiversity is rapidly declining. Are these issues up for debate? I don&#39;t think so. Now is the time to stop pointing fingers and start the restoration. Earth&#39;s essential ecosystems need restoration wether CO2 causes warming or not!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>yes, and when I studied environmental science this is exactly what we were talking about, now no one talks about anything except climate change. Fuck pollution, biodiversity, fuck ecosystems, just mean global temperature, that is all that matters. If we lose ecosystems and we can blame it on temperature then maybe we&#39;ll care, otherwise, fuck it.

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;We don&#39;t know&quot; is kind of an insidious term. &quot;We don&#39;t know&quot; sounds like even the world&#39;s most brilliant and rigorous scientists are just shrugging their shoulders, when in fact we have good reason to believe that irreparable damage will be done to the climate if we don&#39;t meet certain emission-reduction goals. It&#39;s not as precise as we&#39;d like it to be - indeed there is disagreement even within the consensus about where the point of no return is or how bad the consequences will be in 20, 50, 100 years. To suggest that it&#39;s &quot;not science&quot; because it inevitably lacks perfect precision is disingenuous.

<p>The existence of this threat has been suggested by scientific evidence. It&#39;s not just a guess that a hotter world would be bad.

<p>I agree. But let me give you another perspective. CO2 levels during prehistoric times, i.e. Dinosaur times were several times what they are today. The current percentage composition of CO2 is less than 0.1%, I&#39;ve read papers claiming it was around a staggering 10-15%! And do you know what else? Vegetation <strong>thrived</strong>! People will probably try to read between the lines and accuse me of encouraging dumping more CO2 into the atmosphere by burning more fuels, but that&#39;s not my point. CO2 is plant food. And btw, some scientific papers I&#39;ve seen have made a very convincing case that volcano eruptions top the list of major contributors to atmospheric CO2. </p>

<p>My point? We know jackshit, and should tread carefully. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Tread carefully on what,  the vested fossil fuel industry that has contaminated our environment and postponed alternatives :)   (What to speak of the illegal oil wars and corrupting the political process with bribes)</p>

<p>But you are right about the claims we make,  there need to be disclaimers.    The better research does have disclaimers.   It seems there are many obvious and good reasons that the fossil industry should not have been allowed to dictate policy to the degree it has and held back the progress towards solar and wind the way they have.    The &quot;externalities&quot; of their actions are being paid for by people who do not have political access,  can&#39;t afford the necessary bribes.</p>

<p>Why are we debating CO2 under the circumstances?   Are there not more obvious talking points upon which to stop the corruption?</p>

Look at the sea level rising and literally affecting millions of people. I am against coal but I know it&#39;s a necessary evil. You late stage capitalism society is all about immediate gratification and cheap everything. Right now its so shoe horned into the corruption of our gov&#39;t that we are told that renewable energy is bad. That is complete fucking bullshit. Renewable energy is an investment for the future generations of this country and the climate debate stifles any talk of that keeping us at each others throats.</p>

<p>Regardless of what you believe, if we aren&#39;t going to take the reputable climate data seriously and do our part to reduce the shit we do that damages our environment; at least create massive-scale projects (remember the hoover dam) which reinforces and shores up areas that have the potential to be impacted the most by a rising sea level.</p>

<p>I live near the ocean and the water level has remained constant all of my somewhat long life.  Al Gore stood within yards of that same ocean and said it would rise...and it has not.  Not a bit.  Not at all.  None.  Zip.  Zilch.  Nada.  The beaches here are small enough that it would be extremely noticeable.  But nope.</p>

<p>See that&#39;s what I&#39;m contesting. The scientific community is very divided on this. Did you see Dr. Judith Curry&#39;s statement in the conference I posted? She nails this &quot;groupthink&quot; right into the damn coffin. We know TOO LITTLE! </p>

<blockquote>

<p>Again, you bring forth the pseudo science. What proof do you have that the sea level has been rising <strong>drastically</strong>? How have you not attributed that to tectonic plate shifts like so many geologists and seismologists have? The brunt of this knee-jerk reaction to a mythical looming crisis will be borne by the average citizen, while the corporate elite will sit back and watch all of us tear each other apart. We should tread carefully in matters which involve an entire society&#39;s livelihood, lest we land ourselves back to the stone age. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>So Dr Judith Curry believes there is groupthink going on and scientists could do a much better job...</p>

<blockquote>
<p>While Judith Curry supports the scientific opinion on climate change,[15] she has argued that climatologists should be more accommodating of those skeptical of the scientific consensus on climate change.[15] Curry has stated she is troubled by what she calls the &quot;tribal nature&quot; of parts of the climate-science community, and what she sees as stonewalling over the release of data and its analysis for independent review.[15]</p>
</blockquote>

<p>BUT she also believes, according to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judith_Curry">this</a>, in this:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The scientific consensus is that the Earth&#39;s climate system is unequivocally warming, and that it is extremely likely (meaning 95% probability or higher) that this warming is predominantly caused by humans. It is likely that this mainly arises from increased concentrations of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, such as from deforestation and the burning of fossil fuels, partially offset by human caused increases in aerosols; natural changes had little effect.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So she believes in much of the conclusion but not all of the science and process used to get there.</p>

<p>You, on the other hand, deny the conclusions with her objection as part of your &quot;evidence&quot;. </p>

<p>But you don&#39;t like pollution either...got that.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You are a shill gullibly promoting oil, even if presumably unintentional. The climate has changed the oceans have acidified. The Great Barrier reef is practically dead 90% of it. A natural wonder seen from the moon is dying and almost completely dead. That took tens of thousands of years to form.  Rainforests are declining 100s of thousands of acres are being felled and the land is changing to more flight paths, roads, cities, and urbanization. Our atmosphere is swimming in emissions and that carbon level is higher now then it was at when there were the dinosaurs. This year we have probably had the most deaths relating to cancers. Glaciers and permafrost has retreated so rapidly that they won&#39;t never come back and the tundra they leave behind belches methane adding more emissions and causing change. Larsen&#39;s Ice shelf, the frontal part of the continent Antarctica is going, and it is pulling away from the mainland, but when that goes the rest becomes much more unstable. Hey you can book a holiday cruise to past through Arctic waters where a decade ago you needed an icebreaker. Greenland that ice is going fast and it just doesn&#39;t refreeze like every other glacier disappearing in the last 100 years.</p>

<p>Wake up, climate change exists and you are only promoting more Oil here in this topic, and its result affects every ecosystem animal and human causing that change even more rapidly.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The icecaps haven&#39;t reformed and they aren&#39;t reforming. But you must mean that as in much much less because when the ice goes you must think that it compacts into a smaller formation or something? So its okay folk because it has gotten smaller. What is wrong with you. It simply hasn&#39;t done on every glacier retreating by 100 of miles, really famous glaciers. Like Larsen Ice Shelf which has miles of a deepening fissured trench spanning across a lot it, as it is breaking away off of the mainland and the thousands of lakes forming on the top of it cracking right to the surface ocean where that ice is melting. Siberia, Greenland, Iceland, Canada, Argentina, and Alaska etc the glaciers are retreating by miles upon miles and no they simply aren&#39;t refreezing, and the tundra left behind from the permafrost gone is belching methane adding to climate emissions. Fresh water from this phenomenon adds to ocean acidification, warming sea temperatures killing the reefs. Causing more extreme weather patterns. Some of that rise is also from our wasteful run off and the raw sewage and all of those oceans fills we loved so much pre the 90&#39;s, and also the atmospheric emissions, and the increased tectonic movement and fissures often opening up more and more due to increased populational geoscaping and fracking.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t need your oh what is wrong with you, why don&#39;t you believe mey speech baiting more down votes, because you have linked me some nazi propaganda and its purpose was for churning more of oil&#39;s agenda and wars.</p>

<p>Next he is linking far right clippings sourced mostly from uncreditable sources and where are those feeds from. That have been denying climate change. But pushing an oil agenda.</p>

<p>Please moderator I didn&#39;t know the term of shill somebody with an agenda, or the term nazi was offensive at all. On my countries listing just released last week it gave a national statistic from ofcom my countries regulator of offensive words and nazi was ranked least offensive with words and no offense meant like cunt and related ranked the highest. Tell which word will get filtered?</p>

<p>I honestly didn&#39;t think I had done nothing wrong. I have nothing against the far right or anybody else. I just don&#39;t understand this bad press containing an agenda shouting conspiracy. When the conspiracy is obvious that the agenda is being turned for oil&#39;s gain. Like we haven&#39;t heated this planet up enough.</p>

<p>When this year 2016  has seen the far right gain, we are getting much more of that agenda being pushed into many feeds. </p>

<p>So I am sorry, but this issue climate change means something to me and I feel people should be aware that it exists. Why do we want to live on a planet that&#39;s dying what future do we have and our children have?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It was an insult when it was the truth. Yes it had a tone reflecting my concern. The articles presented were largely sourced from the far right neo nazi organizations promoting conspiracy when the agenda was no conspiracy at all but oil production. Look at his user tag when presenting those articles reflecting what status, innocence. It couldn&#39;t be any more obvious, but I suppose they thought they were mad max or something?</p>

<p>I am sorry for possibly being offensive. It wasn&#39;t intended</p>

<p>I have lost loved ones in the senseless and retarded war <del>on</del> of terror. Iraqi relatives. You think I put the fucking oil companies which plundered Iraq under the guise of NATO on a fucking pedestal? YOU THINK I&#39;D BE HERE SHILLING FOR THOSE WARMONGERING PIECES OF SHIT?!

    <div class="md"><p>Haha here comes the truth. </p>

<p>Spartan is a term for what organization, no not the nazi&#39;s and then you are driving a tank? But you are denying something so obvious like linking uncreditable feeds from the same organizations where you just happened too choose a logo?</p>

<p>Please we are all so innocence and it should be stamped on each of our RIP.</p>

<p>No I don&#39;t know you. I based a probable statistic factoring a percentage of math before giving an opinion and that math has favored what odds. </p>

<p>Maybe you are just somebody looking and then going hey I will copy that because it was cool. So I am sorry for getting you worked up that was not my intention. It was simply denying that bad press linked because it was lies.</p>

<p>The war in Iraq wasn&#39;t what we are discussing when it was climate change.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>They may be &quot;uncreditable&quot; to you, but many of those sources are some of the top independent reporters, one being James Corbett. And several are whistleblower reports, such as the one with Dr. Judith Curry. Make of that what you will. </p>

<p>And regarding your creepy obsession with my username, holy shit, it&#39;s just unhealthy the way you try to look for something that isn&#39;t there. I still have no fucking clue what company is named Spartan, and I still don&#39;t understand the link you allege between it and Tank.

    <div class="md"><p>I personally struggle with this issue. At this point we are almost bullied in believing whatever they say about climate change, if you question anything you are pretty much committing a sin.</p>

<p>Assuming there is climate change as a consequence of human activity a lot of other factors still need to be consider. How much is it reasonable to spend attempting to revert it?</p>

<p>I&#39;m personally not impressed by the rise in temperature we have had so far in the last 100years... all we did an the overall change was of less than a 1º Celsius? Pfff.</p>

<p>All this money and effort attempting to decrease the increase of CO² emissions (as far as I know we keep consuming more fossel fuel each year regardless) while you could use the same money to do things that would have a much more meaningful impact the environment (or use it somewhere else).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>With every conspiracy, there is always more to it than meets the eye.</p>

<p>In the case of climate change, I don&#39;t think the elite are worried about the polar ice caps.</p>

<p>I believe they are worried about the ice attached to the glass sky in the atmosphere.</p>

<p>Have you heard of Megacryometeors? They are big chunks of ice that fall to the ground every so often and they have become more and more commonplace since the 50s.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/4315744?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents">This paper</a> discusses the increasing problem of megacryometeors. Go to the last paragraph on the last page.</p>

<p>The emissions are heating the upper atmosphere and they are worried about the ice on the glass dome/sky melting.</p>

<p>If a large chunk of ice fell to earth and landed in an urban area, it could result in many fatalities.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>yes, and when I studied environmental science this is exactly what we were talking about, now no one talks about anything except climate change. Fuck pollution, biodiversity, fuck ecosystems, just mean global temperature, that is all that matters. If we lose ecosystems and we can blame it on temperature then maybe we&#39;ll care, otherwise, fuck it. It is enough to make a cynic out of the most hippie-eath-loving-wanted-to-be-a-scientist person who I used to be.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;We don&#39;t know&quot; is kind of an insidious term. &quot;We don&#39;t know&quot; sounds like even the world&#39;s most brilliant and rigorous scientists are just shrugging their shoulders, when in fact we have good reason to believe that irreparable damage will be done to the climate if we don&#39;t meet certain emission-reduction goals. It&#39;s not as precise as we&#39;d like it to be - indeed there is disagreement even within the consensus about where the point of no return is or how bad the consequences will be in 20, 50, 100 years. To suggest that it&#39;s &quot;not science&quot; because it inevitably lacks perfect precision is disingenuous. It&#39;s also dangerous because it allows people to shrug off the very real threat. </p>
