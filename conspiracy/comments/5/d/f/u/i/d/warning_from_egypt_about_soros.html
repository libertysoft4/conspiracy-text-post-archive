        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Pedes,</p>

<p>I am noticing a pattern the U.S is going through that&#39;s very similar to that of my own country, Egypt. In 2013 Egypt started some major swamp drainage which still continues to this day. We were getting rid of both cucks and Islamists under president Sisi. We were undoing the dark works of Obama, Hillary, and Soros. Soros fucked with our country big time and Egyptians fighting back to restore their country wasn&#39;t easy. We had to go through extremely tough days just because we were getting in the way of the elite&#39;s plan to &quot;tame&quot; Egypt and force it to be part of the false song of globalism.</p>

<p>If you think Trump&#39;s win is it, you&#39;re wrong. You&#39;re so wrong and if you continue to behave like it&#39;s the ultimate win, you will lose EVERYTHING. The elite will fight hard, the media will be ruthless. Violence may increase, your beliefs will be challenged. Trump&#39;s win is only the beginning of the fight. All it did is put you in the battle arena. Before that, you weren&#39;t even eligible for a fight. A Trump win only means &quot;okay, show me how you fight&quot;.</p>

<p>I noticed a significant increase in shitposts (keep them coming they&#39;re awesome) but they can&#39;t be at the expense of enlightening posts. Keep digging, keep exposing, make videos, talk to friends. Do everything in your power. Fight! Don&#39;t get lazy now! Outside of this arena you&#39;re in, being lazy was less dangerous. You can&#39;t afford this laziness now. You will get rekt and broken forever.
This is a war between the people on one side, and a monstrous elite armed with insane amounts of money and an overwhelming army of brainwashed citizens. It&#39;s not easy folks. It&#39;s the fight of your lives. Wake up and fight.</p>

<p>Don&#39;t hate the other side. Don&#39;t forget that you used to be brainwashed too. The message is not to fight your fellow citizen and destroy them. You want them to wake up. Be noble and brave.
Now MAGA!</p>

I don&#39;t get how r/conspiracy got turned into this Trump shit.
Trump is just has elite as anyone else up in wall street, the fact you pepes actually think he&#39;ll drain the swamp is rediculous. Trump was born in and loves the swamp, he&#39;d, if any thing make it worse. The guys is known for insider training...
 I&#39;m just ranting at this point, but I could go on.
But it really blows my mind all these Trumpers  think Soros is behind all anti-Trump shit. Like do you really think you need funding to convince people to hate this facist?</p>

<p>You&#39;re free to believe whatever you want about Trump, but to say Soros isn&#39;t behind all the Anti-Trump shit, funds BLM, Moveon.org, all the recent protests, destabilizes countries and profits from it, then you are in cognitive dissonance.</p>

<p>This guy is clearly behind it all, and just met with the DNC members to continue to plot his bullshit here. Number 1 enemy of the state at this point</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There is a vast network of propaganda outlets that work together in efforts to destabilize countries and inspire uprisings, insurgencies, and regime changes. Soros is a big player, and a fair boogeyman, but there are many more operations contributing to it. To name a few - The Council on Foreign Relations, Freedom House, Google Jigsaw and Alphabet. It&#39;s embedded deep into our society.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t believe the goal here is for regime change or insurgency in the United States. I believe it is to misdirect liberals with red herrings and strawmen to make them believe when they oppose Donald trump they are &quot;fighting against hatred and bigotry and evil&quot;, and this political force can be brought upon him when Trump pushes policies or purges neo cons that liberals would actually favor. </p>

<p>Republican or Democrat, they can&#39;t allow any president or political figurehead gain too much popular support and unity in the country, as that would give them to much power and be a threat to their agenda.</p>

<p>But in case you didn&#39;t know, since your in your cuck circle, the majority of protestors are not pro-hillary, just anti-trump. I mean I hate Hillary too, she did the coop in Hondurus and much much worse things, and yet Trump scares me more than the crooked dynasty.</p>

<p>Did you not see the Craigslist ads hiring protesters?</p>

<p><a href="http://sli.mg/00dXH8">http://sli.mg/00dXH8</a></p>

<p>2) their website shows they are taking applications. Check out where their offices are. I did find it interesting that the Portland protests were so huge.</p>

<p>3) Wikipedia says that Ralph Nader founded this non-profit. It&#39;s had some controversy for not paying employees minimum wage. Confirmed here, a large class action lawsuit against them: <a href="http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2009/07/15/the-liberal-sweatshop.html">http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2009/07/15/the-liberal-sweatshop.html</a>
If you read reviews of the organization on indeed.com, most employees are extremely disgruntled. This is the type of non profit who hires kids out of college and works them to death, canvassing in the streets all day. Most employees only last a few weeks.</p>

<p>4) I found some reports of FFPI paying protestors in the past. They put ads on Craigslist for people who wanted to help get Obamacare passed and the second link is another mobilization climate change. Apparently Soros put 5 billion into FFPI and other similar organizations for this purpose.</p>

<p><a href="https://flutemandy.wordpress.com/tag/fund-for-the-public-interest/">https://flutemandy.wordpress.com/tag/fund-for-the-public-interest/</a></p>

<p><a href="http://www.thenewamerican.com/tech/environment/item/20008-now-hiring-rent-a-mobs-mobilizing-global-warming-activists-for-2015-action">http://www.thenewamerican.com/tech/environment/item/20008-now-hiring-rent-a-mobs-mobilizing-global-warming-activists-for-2015-action</a></p>

<p>5) This points out that many of the umbrella organizations UNDER FFPI are funded by Soros. (So clearly FFPI is as well.)</p>

<p><a href="http://sli.mg/9x9TB8">http://sli.mg/9x9TB8</a></p>

<p>I&#39;m on mobile so limited in what I can find, but hopefully some of you can make every more connections.</p>

<p>Edits: more info found.</p>

<p>Craigslist advertisements for post election jobs by FFPI. One of them says &quot;Don&#39;t just protest, take action!&quot; </p>

<p><a href="http://sli.mg/xo3uiS">http://sli.mg/xo3uiS</a></p>

<p>Another article showing that current Trump protestors answered Craigslist ads and are being paid to protest. FFPI has a HISTORY of posting Craigslist ads for special purposes</p>

<p>Reminder, for those of you unfamiliar with O&#39;Keefe&#39;s videos, it was proven that democratic operatives have been hiring people to protest Trump and incite violence. They even admit to hiring mentally ill people. </p>

<p>You said the KKK endorsed Trump, which is a logical fallacy. He doesn&#39;t endorse them back and has been against that mentality his whole career.</p>

<p>That&#39;s why I gave you the point about air and water. If you are saying Trump is bad because KKK endorses him, then Air/Water are also bad because KKK breath and drink it.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Islam eventually always breeds violence anywhere it goes when the numbers get big enough and when Wahhabism, the violet form of Islam, is spread by Saudi Arabia. This is just fact.</p>

<p>But hey, if you think Islam is fine, go spend some time in Yemen or Syria and let me know how it went...</p>

<p>Globalist? You mean people are starting to respect other people&#39;s cultures?</p>

<p>No Globalism is something much crazier then people respecting other people&#39;s cultures, which is the stupidest thing I ever heard because you will never get people to respect all cultures because of individuality as an identity and nationalism.</p>

<p>Globalism is an open border economic destroying New World Order which pools the money further into the hands of the 1% while destroying countries...just like greece is right now, and the Middle East countries</p>

<p>Examples of what? Globalism? Just google Nafta and the dangers of Globalism and inform yourself</p>

<p>Fuck race! I&#39;m half black and I stay away from Muslims and stay away from all black neighborhoods. Why? Because I was partially raised in those cultures and they are toxic separatist and violent hell holes where they are just waiting to kill and destroy anyone/anything not like them, and if they can&#39;t do that then they destroy/eat each other up. Islam and the Ghettos are terrible ideologies and cultures and if you protect these sorts of things you are going to pay for it big time in the future.</p>

<p>SJW&#39;s are trying to get rid of any speech that hurts anyone&#39;s feeling going against one of the most important amendments and from there on out its a dangerous slope we all would face, like something out of Orwell&#39;s 1984.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>It&#39;s also because of race, religion, ideology, and most importantly culture. Saudi Arabia for example is filled with Oil money in the Billions and they are still producing fundamentalism and spreading terrorism, so &quot;poverty&quot; isn&#39;t an excuse.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>First, still avoid the question. So you slander someone without any proof. That&#39;s why the only leftist argument left &quot;you&#39;re a racist&quot; no longer works.</p>

<p>Second, &quot;minority&quot;? No we just wiped the floor with the left and trump won more electoral votes than anyone in the last 50 years. It&#39;s now been shown also that 3 to 5 million votes for Hillary were from illegal aliens. They have already begun to be purged from the voter rolls (CNN didn&#39;t tell you that one did they?)</p>

<p>Finally, the fact that you think enforcing the law is fascism is why you are a morally bankrupt loser. If you consider the president enforcing the law equally on everyone fascist, then I guess you&#39;re right, trump will be your worst nightmare.

    <div class="md"><p>OP&#39;s analogy to fighting is a good one. However, still rooted in old game style thinking.</p>

<p>With years of alternative / what some may call pseudo science research, you start seeing that co-creative or our mass consciousness is actually generating our reality. </p>

<p>This means in our current paradigm as more wake up, as truths are revealed, more people think along the same lines, those corrupt must be brought to justice and made an example. </p>

<p>Of course fighting is just an analogy, but we need to start seeding this idea that everything starts by thought form. If enough people collectively think those criminals involved at the highest levels of government must go to jail, the higher likliehood this will happen. Good FBI and CIA agents, members of Congress and DOJ will suddenly take the appropriate steps to achieve what we are meditating on. </p>

<p>The good news is that from a few research data points/sources, we have already reached critical mass in that direction.</p>

<p>Not so. Morsi was the first (an possibly the last) democratically elected leader of Egypt.</p>

<p>I have no doubt that the Arab Spring was not organic - or that it was manipulated by the likes of those you mentioned.</p>

<p>But the election of Morsi was an unintended outcome. Morsi started behaving in ways that really pissed Israel and Uncle Sugardaddy off - especially by turning a blind eye to the Gaza smuggling tunnels - allowing not only weapons, but food and medicine and fuel and consumer goods to reach the people of Gaza.</p>

<p>He was ruining Israel&#39;s siege, and he HAD to be stopped. </p>

<p>That is when the corrupt Sisi of the corrupt Egyptian Military stepped in and via a TRUE coup, seized control of the country. </p>

<p>Morsi was hated by Obama and Netanyahu, who refused to communicate with him. When Sisi seized power, both Israel and the US immediately reestablished communications - in SPITE of the vicious bloodbath.</p>

<p>Following Sisi&#39;s bloody coup, some US Congressmen proposed that US military aid to Egypt be CUT to punish them for their actions - but it was NOT cut - because a VERY powerful non-governmental organizations ordered congress NOT to do so.</p>

<p>That organization was AIPAC - the American Israel Public Affairs Committee.</p>

<p>There are two kinds of conspiracy theory enthusiasts.</p>

<p>The kind that are really interested in learning the <strong>real</strong> truth, who use skepticism and solid research to delve into these topics.</p>

<p>And then there are the kind that believe Alex Jones.</p>

How about when he was the first person to infiltrate bohemian grove and showed that the elite do satanic rituals and pray to an owl? He was crazy then too right? How about when he said before 911 that the government records every electronic communication we make. Crazy again correct?</p>

<p>How about when he got behind trump before the primary and told him on air he was going to win the election? This was when every one of you leftist tards was laughing at them both. Was he crazy then too? </p>

<p>Obama won 365 the first time, and 332 the second.</p>

<p>Bill won 370 and 379</p>
