        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>This is a truth forum...so..lets talk about truth.  Jesus said,&#39;if you hold to my teachings, then you will know the truth and the truth will set you free&quot;.</p>

<p>John 8 31-32</p>

<p>Also he said &#39;i am the way and the truth and the light.  No ones goes to the Father except through me&#39;.</p>

<p>So in this truth forum...do you care to know the truth?  To know it...you have to hold to Jesus teachings ( no lusting after anyone that isnt your spouse, Love God over everything,  Serve your enemy, love your neighbor, etc).
 I am going to use this thread weekly to add what i think are videos with essential truths. I believe the biggest conspiracy is that the bible is true, Jesus was the son of God and there is enough evidence to support that he was God.</p>

<p>The first essential truth:  is the bible true?   Nothing matters if its not.   Maybe its a book that was distorted over time and is like a game of telephone.  Maybe its used to control the masses.</p>

<p>Or maybe...its actually true.</p>

<p>Check this out <a href="https://youtu.be/G1XJ7DeR5fc">https://youtu.be/G1XJ7DeR5fc</a></p>

<p>Remember...you will only get it if you hold to Jesus&#39; teachings.</p>

<p>The biggest conspiracy is that the bible is actually true...and this forum seems to understand something is up with the spirit cooking, satanic pedo stuff...i am going to try to show that what you are taught about the bible in popular culture has been meant to distract you from the truth...</p>

<p><strong>edit</strong> no one seems to be talking about the evidence provided in the video.  Remember this is a truth forum...so i provided evidence for truth..please discuss the evidence so we can weigh it and see if it is true</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Doubt that the Bible is fully true. Pretty sure it was compromised. I&#39;d rather believe Gnostic Christianity that&#39;s been prosecuted and covered up by the Romans which had only been discovered recently.</p>

<p>The Gnostic Christianity didn&#39;t teach that you&#39;re a sinner and that you&#39;ll burn in hell, nor did it teach the  pagan rituals like resurrection, blood sacrifice and so on. They didn&#39;t believe in shame, guilt or fear because the real God is not like what we&#39;re told in the Bible.</p>

<p>The Gnostic Christians didn&#39;t worship the God of the old testament who&#39;s a maniac and a control freak, instead they taught us that he&#39;s the gatekeeper from the real spiritual realm.</p>

<p>It was more along the lines of Jesus being Neo explaining the matrix. </p>

<p>He taught us that were enslaved and the best way out is when you die.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t need to. That fact that the Bible had Roman empire&#39;s hands on it says it all. You want to tell me that even though all the truth gets hidden from the population and we&#39;re constantly bombarded with lies in the media and somehow the elites are going to allow the ultimate truth of truths to be out there in every book store? Please. There&#39;s no doubt that there&#39;s a lot of good things in the Bible but over all I think it opens your eyes just enough to throw more sand into it. I&#39;ll watch the video right now just to be fair and rationally open minded but I highly doubt it&#39;ll change my mind.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thank you for deciding to watch.  The roman empire tried to burn all documents and kill all christians and even tried to mix their paganism w. Christianity to control it ( to create the false pagan religion catholociam).   </p>

<p>It is astounding we have any copies if the bible...but practically miraculous that we have over 5000 copies by 300 ad...that desteoys any other ancient documents...jusy watch the video.  The next one i post will go into detail on the validity of the histerocity of Jesus resurrection.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This guy gets it. You have to look at the Bible in political terms. Back in ancient Rome there were pagans, Christians and Jews.</p>

<p>They all had separate beliefs. Those Christians back then were nothing like we&#39;re taught in the current Bible. Not even close. </p>

<p>Romans needed to get control over all the population via new found religion so they put together the Bible to appeal to everyone in masses, they got the old testament in there to quell the Jews, add in a dash of paganism through blood sacrifice, virgin birth and resurrection to get the pagans on their side. </p>

<p>Then, they needed to get the real Christians (Gnostics Christians) who were against it all under their control so the council of Nicea cherry picked the specific scrolls to go in the new testament that were mixed with paganism to control the Gnostics via Judeo-Christianity. </p>

<p>They exterminated all the Gnostics and burned all of their teachings and forced the rest of them to convert to this new found religion. </p>

Evidence: <a href="https://youtu.be/221sYyagu2I">https://youtu.be/221sYyagu2I</a> 
Your knowledge of Jesus writing in the sand is spot on though.</p>

<p>You have to be able to sift through what is an actual follower of christ and a fake church like what constantine established....thats why its a conspiracy...and the greatest one at that...cuz its literally a matter of life and death thats been going on since the beginning of time</p>

<p>Your post was painful drivel, vacuous, nutty assumptions trotted out as gleaming revelation. I mean &quot;If Jesus is in your heart, is Jesus then not truth? Yes, of course. Are his teachings no also true? Yes, they are. &quot;, for fuck&#39;s sake. This is why no one takes you freaks seriously.</p>

<p>However, does the age of the earth really matter?   Is that a salvation issue?  Or is that just a nit pick that we can agree or disagree on and move forward with holding to Jesus teachings and knowing the actual truth and not believe the lies the media tells us?
I chose the age of the earth...but relace that with any non salvation issue.
There is a conspiracy to not allow biblical thinking.....dont get caught up in things that arent essentials.
My point was to get people to watch that video because it hits on the main points people throw out there that are silly...but the mainstream world love to profess.</p>

<p>Lets figure out if the bible is a reliable collection of historical documents written down by eyewitnesses during the lifetime of other eyewitnesses. They report [of] supernatural events that took place in fulfillment of specific prophecies and claimed that their writing are divine rather than human in origin.</p>

<p>Yes. I have to resolve the cognitive dissonance of seeing dinosaur bones and knowing they are not mentioned in the bible, or repress my doubt. If I ever went and tried to save souls, the atheists would pester me about dinosaurs. It has to be resolved.</p>

<p>I thought the modern answer is that the old testament is largely symbolic and figurative. Would Jesus have wanted his teaching included with the Old Testament at all? I know he said we are not bound by the old ways, so why do we have to believe that stuff?</p>

<p>Should I check out some Gnostic christian stuff?</p>

<p>I think that is a minor point.   The facts are Jesus is the truth...but no one will never know unless they hold to his teachings...and the video proves that the teachings are credible.</p>

<p>And Jesus consistently affirmed the old testament.  He quoted deuteronomy the most and even the moral laws of leviticus when asked about marriage.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, I&#39;m just so turned off by the whole thing I&#39;m trying to find a way out. I love the Jesus teachings but the old testament is so different. I&#39;m hoping theres a more personal spiritual approach in the Gnostic books.</p>

<p>I think religion has ruined the world but I&#39;m afraid that Jesus was the real deal and I&#39;m an ass for not caring.</p>

<p>Plus I&#39;ve been a Christian before, at least in my mind, and I did not find the burden light and the path easy to follow.</p>

<p>One of my good friends even got kicked out of a legit san diego ministry church after getting sick in Cambodia on a mission after feeling that he had become posessed. It may have just been mental health problems, but they kicked him out after years of service and a lot of $$$ spent. It&#39;s like Jesus is cool but his followers and generally assholes that don&#39;t get it.</p>

<p>Plus: Christian music is god awful :)</p>

<p>PS: I commend your outreach. You are supposed to save the lost. This is a great place to find us. Kicking ass for Christ.</p>

And honestly, people have been trying to convert me all my life. I grew up on the rez and its always the same story. No. God is not real. Jesus never preformed miracle&#39;s. That shit is not real life man. Wake up. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>False claims?  No false claims. All religious thinking originated out of mans need to explain the sun and the moon. Its as simple as that. You have been lied to your whole life. &quot;Im guessing you&#39;re a teenager&quot; because of that I dont fault you, believe what you will my man. How about this, like comedy? George Carlins work. That guy is amazing &quot;sad loss for the world&quot;. </p>

<p>Maybe let him explain it, in a funny way <a href="https://youtu.be/8r-e2NDSTuE">https://youtu.be/8r-e2NDSTuE</a> if anything, out of respect for the dead. Listen the whole 10 min or so. </p>

<p>But for real. At the end of the day, if believing in christ makes you sleep better at night. Imvall for it, for you. Its just not for me. </p>

<p>Welcome to the sub. We dont post much religious stuff round here. But all are welcome</p>

    <div class="md"><p>At 6 minutes and 32 seconds in. .the amount of false claims are astounding.</p>

<p>The earliest evidence of a crucifixion is 500bc.  To state it was 3000 bc is simply a lie or ignorance.  That is why psalm 22 ( referenced in my video...which i hope you watched ), is astounding as it is amazing because it was writting like at 1000bc and predicted a crucifixion of the messiah ( note crucifixion had not been invented yet in human history).  </p>

<p>At 6:32 it also claims horus has 12 diciples.  No reliable manuscript says this...he had 4 and some say he had 16.</p>

<p>He was never baptized....where is the reliable manuscript that says this?  In what museum is it held so i can view it.   It doesnt exist.</p>

<p>He did not have a virgin birth.  Isis is his mother.  Why the emphasis on throwing the penis in the river if the penis wasnt used to give him birth?</p>

<p>This video is really frustrating me in its peddling of easily falsified claims.</p>

<p>Let me let you in on the real conspiracy..isis and osirus are the same as nimrod and samiramis.  Do some digging.</p>

<p>I will only continue the video once you provide evidence that the claims i made are false and that the video is soundly true up to 6 minutes and 32 seconds in</p>

<p>Please research and get back to me.  If you do not know the answers...then ask youself....why?</p>

<p>Heres a scripture.
Acts 17:11
 Now the Berean Jews were of more noble character than those in Thessalonica, for they received the message with great eagerness and <strong>examined the Scriptures every day to see if what Paul said was true</strong></p>

<p>Did you examine this video at all?<br/>
Thats what you need to do.  Examine what any religious source is saying to see if it is true.</p>

<p>Research...and get back to me.   Watch the video i posted too...the entire thing.</p>

<p>After watching my video...lets discuss what you believe is false in it.</p>

<p>Lastly...this video mentions december 25th...i sure hope it doesnt claim past 6:32 in that that is Jesus birthday......if it does and you believe it...you clearly are in error and dont know much about the bible....</p>

<p>Not that skin color matters...but Jesus himself...id argue was probably darker skin...or middle brown.  He was in Jerusalem...but seemed to blend into egypt when there was a degree to kill infants.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The answers are in the bible and easily found on bing/google..again...this is a truth forum.  Dig.  Where does the evidence lead you.</p>

<p>But...your question..as important as it is.. has nothing to do with the video i posted.</p>

<p>So far no one in this thread has even addressed the points in this video.</p>

<p>If you want to have a serious discussion about the bible, then we can on r/christianity or by personal message...cuz i will respect that.  However,  if you just wanna play &#39;im not gonna do research and im just gonna spout my beliefs without sound evidence...and will not be swayed by sound evidence&#39; then u dont actually care about the truth and i dont have time...cuz i took time to listen to your points and researched it...thinking you would give me the same basic decent respect.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Its so easy to determine when you read it and try to adhere to Jesus teachings.   Its written at a 4th grade level.</p>

<p>However, does the age of the earth really matter?   Is that a salvation issue?  Or is that just a nit pick that we can agree or disagree on and move forward with holding to Jesus teachings and knowing the actual truth and not believe the lies the media tells us?
I chose the age of the earth...but relace that with any non salvation issue.
There is a conspiracy to not allow biblical thinking.....dont get caught up in things that arent essentials.
My point was to get people to watch that video because it hits on the main points people throw out there that are silly...but the mainstream world love to profess.</p>

<p>Lets figure out if the bible is a reliable collection of historical documents written down by eyewitnesses during the lifetime of other eyewitnesses. They report [of] supernatural events that took place in fulfillment of specific prophecies and claimed that their writing are divine rather than human in origin.</p>
