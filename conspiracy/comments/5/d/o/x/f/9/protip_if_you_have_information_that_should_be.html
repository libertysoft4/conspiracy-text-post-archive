        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Let&#39;s say you have come across some information that should be public, but is currently secret. This information threatens someone or something important. You fear that by having the information, you might be in jeopardy.</p>

<p>What should you do? It&#39;s simple. Release the information. Publish it. </p>

<p>Put it on the Internet. Twitter, Facebook, YouTube, LinkedIn, Snapchat, web sites, BitTorrent, whatever.</p>

<p>Publish it in a magazine or book. Old school is still cool.</p>

<p>Print out copies and hand them out at street corners. </p>

<p>Make sure to attach your real name to all of the information that you publish.</p>

<p>That way, the bad people who are trying to keep information secret when it shouldn&#39;t be will no longer have any incentive to kill you or do you harm. In fact, if they do harm you, they will be the obvious suspect in the crime. For that reason, they won&#39;t touch you.</p>

<p>Let&#39;s say you want to release a bunch of emails from the DNC that show bad actions. Just release them all at once, and <strong>attach your name to the release</strong>.</p>

<p>Let&#39;s say you are investigating a global pedophile conspiracy that may involve Satanism and murder. Release and publish all the information <strong>as you get it, and attach your real name to the release, so if your body is found in Haiti or Poland with a suicde note, it will be obvious who had an incentive to harm you</strong>. This is the surest way to not being harmed in the first place. </p>

<p>Let&#39;s say you want to run a web site publishing leaks of information that will expose human rights violations and political corruption of a very serious nature, providing proof of guilt at the highest levels, of people who are ruthless, and that you put yourself out there in the public eye doing this. <strong>Release or publish all of the information at once. Do not release the information in little pieces day after day, saving the most incriminating pieces for last.</strong> Do not get overly clever. Get everything out at once, and they will not have any incentive to take you down, <strong>because the information is already out</strong>.</p>

<p>Do not attack a &quot;conspiracy of silence&quot; by remaining silent yourself, even for a little while.</p>

<p>EDIT: It&#39;s been fun debating folks, and it&#39;s getting wearisome. I made my point, directed to people who are or might be in the future in the actual situation described. I did not intend to disturb the paranoiac thoughts of some armchair conspiracy theorists out there. Thank you and carry on.</p>

Sad situations all of them. I&#39;m disappointed in big business, big pharma and government positions as a result. Keeping our mouths shut has proven to be a much safer course of action in my experience.. People are people who simply want to protect their own interests especially at the higher echelons.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah no.</p>

<p>Go look at how many whistle blowers have been killed under mysterious circumstances. It&#39;s too easy to make a death look like an accident, killing any links to the parties responsible. </p>

<p>Then even if they were linked, you&#39;re assuming any investigatory agency would want to make that link. Their lives are on the line as well.</p>

<p>The guy exposed that those billions of tax dollars that were needed for a &quot;war on terror&quot; were being used to murder civilians for fun, basically.</p>

<p>And how is it that you&#39;re saying what whistleblowers should be doing when you obviously don&#39;t even know about some of the most famous recent cases? &quot;After looking...&quot; dude you should already know if you&#39;re trying to tell whistleblowers what they should be doing.</p>

<p>Whistleblowers should base their decisions on the information they have. Simple, small workplace violation? Blow the fuck out of that whistle. You caught Hillary dry humping Harambe? You&#39;d better release that anonymously or you will likely die.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think Snowden confirmed what many people already believed was going on or at the very least knew was technologically possible. We knew about the peering cables at Tier-1 data centers across the country 15 years ago when telcos were granted immunity for complying with all of the unconstitutional nonsense immediately after 9-11. </p>

<p>Assange? Hmm. I tend to agree with OP that the best way to ensure one&#39;s safety and still get the entire cache of leaked info into the hands of the public is to visibly dump everything at once and take inextricable credit for doing so.  This assumes that the leaker is a legit whistleblower and not some sort of government disinformation campaign. While I understand the urge to verify the authenticity of the leaked documents, I wouldn&#39;t have given the press an invitation to help &quot;curate&quot; what was released as Assange did. </p>

<p>and it is saying that right before his death in the car crash, he told some people that he was on to a big story. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t know anything about this case except what I read on Wikipedia, but it makes my point for me.</p>

<p>If you are on to something big, and it could put you in jeopardy, <strong>publish everything you have immediately</strong>. Do not wait.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sorry, you don&#39;t get to pick and choose who was responsible for his death, especially since no one knows.</p>

<p>All we can do is use the information we have. Hastings got McChrystal to resign. McChrystal says hastings would regret it. Hastings emails GQ saying he&#39;s got a story. Dies.</p>

<p>How you can say &quot;It&#39;s wasn&#39;t McChrystal&quot;? That&#39;s pretty dishonest to make that claim, especially when you obviously haven&#39;t looked much into it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes. I don&#39;t know who killed him. I&#39;m not ruling anything out. That&#39;s honest.</p>

<p>Dishonest is saying it wasn&#39;t &#39;X&#39; when evidence points towards it. Dishonest is not acknowledging that you could be wrong and disregarding any evidence presented to you that contradicts your belief.</p>
