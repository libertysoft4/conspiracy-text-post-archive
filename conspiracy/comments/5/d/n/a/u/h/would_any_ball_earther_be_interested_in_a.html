        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Update 2:</p>

<p><strong>As it turns out, so far no ball earther is willing (or able) to come up with 10 proofs of their model and have them scrutinized. How strange, seeing that it should be the easiest thing in the world to do. GO FIGURE.</strong></p>

<p>Original Post</p>

<p><strong>This post is only for setting the terms of the debate if it happens</strong></p>

<p>Flat earth posts gets derailed and argumentative pretty quickly, so we would need someone to moderate based on the arguments presented. Would be awesome if one of the r/conspiracy mods could volunteer to moderate?</p>

<p>I suggest the following format: (Your suggestions welcome.)</p>

<p>Each side has to present 10 proofs for their argument, one talking point at a time. Thread can go on for a while, doesn&#39;t have to be over a specific time period.</p>

<p>After Side A has made their first point, they get awarded 1 point.</p>

<p>Side B gets to do a rebuttal, and if successful (based on argument presented), Side A loses the point and it goes to Side B. </p>

<p>Side B makes their first point, and so on.</p>

<p>Any takers or suggestions?</p>

<p><em>Update 1: 
Added links for Flat Earth 101 for those who are new to this subject.</em></p>

<p>I would like to keep this post for getting the debate thread going. If you&#39;re new to the flat earth phenomenon, I highly recommend watching this video. It&#39;s presented well and is mostly based on books written on the subject. It covers all the basics. Running time 2 hours.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The why is a good question, and one that should definitely be asked. But how would anyone know for sure? Also that question should not detract from the facts of the argument.</p>

<p>My best guess on this is that normal everyday people have been sold an entirely fake worldview. Almost nothing works the way we have been taught - government, politics, the economy you name it, right down to the nature of reality.</p>

<p>Not getting into the proofs in this thread - I&#39;m hoping the debate (if it happens) will answer a lot of questions for everyone.</p>

<p>That video is filmed with a fisheye lens. It&#39;s going to make everything look curved whether it is curved or not. Fisheye lenses are absolutely unreliable for gathering empirical proof of the shape of an object.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yup. If the earth was flat, we could use the same telescopic cameras that we can view the moon with, aim them, say, east (if you are in the US) and easily see across the Atlantic Ocean and check on Europe, look at mountain ranges in other countries.</p>

<p>Of course then a flat earther would say you couldn&#39;t because our world isn&#39;t laid out like known maps because that&#39;s a conspiracy too. You could offer proof involving satellites, gps, planes, ships, etc and a flat earther will always just say it&#39;s part of the conspiracy</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes it&#39;s very tough for most people. It&#39;s not easy (or sometimes even possible) for people to question the fundamentals of what their entire worldview is based upon. I mean when do you see a ball earth model for the first time? First grade? That model then gets reinforced over not only your school years, but also on TV, movies, logos and all kind of other more subtle ways. I read somewhere that repetition is the most basic form of mind control - and I think that is why it&#39;s so difficult for people to even consider this.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Wouldn&#39;t be a easy. First I&#39;d have to reacquaint myself with the evidence, and the arguments of the flat earth hypothesis. Then I&#39;d have to not only remember all the scientific explanations for the arguments but put them forth in a fashion that would convince someone who has closed their mind to rational, scientific, thought processes.</p>

<p>When it&#39;s easier for those with the burden of proof, which would be you since you&#39;re arguing for the existence of something that goes against commonly held theories, to send a drone up high enough to see the truth. Since the photographic proof as acquired by others isn&#39;t trustworthy (NASA, etc) I would expect the only proof you would accept is that proof you get for yourself</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hi Nerdherd99, nothing wrong with that idea. I&#39;m just trying to get a conversation going with some structure to it. From personal experience the flat earth threads tend to go off in all manner of directions - it&#39;s a HUUUHE subject. Also being in the minority group it&#39;s difficult for one person to defend his viewpoint against a ton of other people who are all jumping in on the thread at the same time.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yup. If the earth was flat, we could use the same telescopic cameras that we can view the moon with, aim them, say, east (if you are in the US) and easily see across the Atlantic Ocean and check on Europe, look at mountain ranges in other countries.</p>

<p>Of course then a flat earther would say you couldn&#39;t because our world isn&#39;t laid out like known maps because that&#39;s a conspiracy too. You could offer proof involving satellites, gps, planes, ships, etc and a flat earther will always just say it&#39;s part of the conspiracy</p>
