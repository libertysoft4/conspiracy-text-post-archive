<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/WikiLeaks/comments/5d5sxp/here_is_a_useful_resource_of_links_for_visiting/da204pn/">https://www.reddit.com/r/WikiLeaks/comments/5d5sxp/here_is_a_useful_resource_of_links_for_visiting/da204pn/</a></p>

<p>That is a perma link to his comment where he tells people to use tor without protection &#39;just download the bundle and go&#39;, after linking to a resource full of CP.</p>

<p>It started with cleansing all who doubted them, through massive bans.  Followed by enforcing only content they approve of/agree with.</p>

<p>Hence the killing of the sub, in &#39;new&#39; there are hardly any new posts - towards the bottom there is a 1 day old post.  Which means the subreddit is borderline dead.  If you notice, a lot of the posts are from mods.   The other thing is, they put all these mods on to &#39;fix&#39; the sub, due to an influx of users, and they ended up killing it. </p>

<p>Somehow admins haven&#39;t banned him, I assume he has pull with admins, or is working for an intelligence agency.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well yeah I mean - drawing the full conclusion of it requires a certain stretch of the imagination and predisposition towards some &quot;rich and powerful people eat babies&quot; mindset.  But an actual look at the evidence and you can&#39;t help but think something very creepy is going on.  I&#39;m saying it&#39;s quite the coincidence if that&#39;s all just innocent interactions being extrapolated - I&#39;m fairly convinced (as someone I thought to be a reasonable person) that something&#39;s up.  It&#39;s just far more likely to be deliberate misinformation/substantiated lies or a deliberate attempt to plant a particularly ridiculous conspiracy that will never be proven to discredit the rest of the clinton criticism, rather than an actual undercover pedo ring (but hey - they&#39;re not unprecedented).</p>

<p>Likely &quot;boring&quot; outcome: the pizza thing was code for drugs or good ol&#39; fashioned American prostitution.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Weren&#39;t the Podesta emails rolling out automatically anyway?</p>

<p>From Oct. 12.</p>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/wikileaks/status/786172351192797184">https://twitter.com/wikileaks/status/786172351192797184</a></p>

<p>That seems to imply that the Podesta emails are just rolling out automatically. Granted, the whole process may have been hijacked, but I assumed at the time this meant that Assange or whoever did not need to publish each batch.</p>

<p>Also, as <a href="/u/fat_osvaldo">/u/fat_osvaldo</a> mentions, there are emails verifiable by DKIM published after Oct. 16th. It was never the case that all of Podesta&#39;s emails were verifiable by DKIM.</p>

<p>Definitely the Wikileaks sub is compromised, and the absence of Assange since Oct. 16 is troubling.</p>

<p>Edit: Here is an email published 2016-10-31 that is verifiable by DKIM.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Did they block you on twitter at the same time?  Were you spamming their twitter?</p>

<p>The mod is a mod on many wikileaks subs, and hence the massive bans.  Normally it&#39;s just ban to the relevant sub, do you have your comment that got you banned?  Did you post on the other subs, or is it just ones he moderates?</p>

<p>I mean...how would they know it&#39;s related (your reddit acc and twitter acc)?  The reason you got banned on twitter is not the same reason you got banned from the sub, is what I&#39;m saying.</p>

<p>I do believe something feels off about their twitter, but to assume they are both connected, is really reaching.  I&#39;d need proof you didn&#39;t post on their twitter to believe it was connected, and that would mean you are being monitored heavily, which I very much doubt.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>the purpose of <a href="/r/wikileaks">/r/wikileaks</a> is to discuss the leaks, not encourage people to use tor and browse the darkweb. And they are VERY strict.. they banned 48 people in a 2 day period because those people tried to discuss Julian Assange. Yes, despite what the sidebar says, the new mods have decided julian assange is &quot;off topic&quot; for <a href="/r/wikileaks">/r/wikileaks</a>. </p>

<p>So explain to me how encouraging people to use Tor is &quot;on topic&quot;?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, are you projecting?  The hidden wiki is one thing, the link your buddy posted, links to child porn.</p>

<p>I just read an article about how google removed illegal content, let me pull that up for you.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Google does not remove pages from its search results except when they contain malware or illegal content. &quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Source: <a href="http://money.cnn.com/2016/11/15/technology/facebook-google-fake-news-presidential-election/">http://money.cnn.com/2016/11/15/technology/facebook-google-fake-news-presidential-election/</a></p>

<p>Any other baseless accusations?</p>

<p>Also, does this count as harassment - two posts before I reply once?  One of which accuses me of searching for child pornography.  Is this acceptable behavior from a mod?</p>

<p><a href="https://postimg.org/image/uybq3tmf1/">https://postimg.org/image/uybq3tmf1/</a></p>

<p>You also didn&#39;t link to the hidden wiki, you linked to the hidden wikis contents.  There is a difference, bud.</p>

<p>Edit:  I missed the &#39;call&#39; the first time I read that.  My bad on that, but no, I don&#39;t as I answered in my post.</p>

<p>It takes steps to remedy the situation, you did not.</p>

<p>That&#39;s an obvious misrepresentation, because it was not a <strong>direct</strong> link to CP. Why don&#39;t you complain to Firefox that their evil browser allows people to connect to CP sites? And IBM for inventing the PC?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Now wikileaks is trying to misconstrue how hashes and precommitment work. They also are acting like assange private response key to the pgp isn&#39;t compromised since they aren&#39;t using. Man they are digging a deeper hole. I&#39;ll feel like a big dick if this is hurting assange, but we have more evidence he isn&#39;t involved than evidence that he is. May kathulu bless us all.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>On twitter I posted a link that teaches people how to check the hashes, keys, and dkim. Like 10 minutes later it was removed and I was blocked. I posted it again from my second account and the same thing.  This morning On the wikileaks sub, I posted asking why the pgp key isn&#39;t used, the dkim is missing and their hashes don&#39;t match. It showed on my account page but not in the sub so I messaged the mods and they never responded so I messaged them again with more harsh words and they replied calling me a fucker or something close, I can copy pasta their response. They don&#39;t want people to know how to check authentication. </p>
