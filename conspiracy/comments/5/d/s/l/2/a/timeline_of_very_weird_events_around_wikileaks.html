        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Here is a brief timeline of events: h/t <a href="/r/WhereIsAssange">/r/WhereIsAssange</a></p>

<p>Apr 16th: John Jones QC, Assange&#39;s U.N. Lawyer dies jumping in front of a train.</p>

<p>May 11th: Michael Ratner, WikiLeaks&#39; chief counsel, dies of cancer.</p>

<p>Jul 10th: Seth Rich, DNC staffer who supposedly leaked DNC documents to Wikileaks, is shot twice in the back and dies. Police report says robbery, but nothing was stolen from his body.</p>

<p>Aug 5th: Edward Snowden (source of leaks on surveillance by the NSA) tweets 64 bit code (potential dead man&#39;s switch).</p>

<p>Aug 10th: Wikileaks offers $20k reward for information on murder of Seth Rich.</p>

<p>Oct 7th: Podestamails leaks first batch.</p>

<p>Oct 14th: John Podesta tweets &quot;I bet the lobster risotto is better than the food at the Ecuadorian Embassy”.</p>

<p>Oct 16th/17th: John Kerry visits the UK, personally pressures Equador to stop Assange from publishing documents about Clinton.</p>

<p>Oct 16th: Wikileaks tweets SHA-256 prerelease keys.</p>

<p>Oct 18th: Equadorian Embassy cuts off Assange&#39;s internet access.</p>

<p>Oct 18th: Pamela Anderson visits Assange and feeds him a vegan sandwich.</p>

<p>Oct 18th: Witnesses photograph and report heavily armed police and vans outside Equadorian Embassy, are barred from approaching and have cellphones confiscated. Live feeds are cut off.</p>

<p>Oct 18th: Fox News reports Assange will be arrested in a matter of hours.</p>

<p>Oct 18th: <a href="https://file.wikileaks.org/file">https://file.wikileaks.org/file</a> made publicly visible, file dates/timestamps changed to 1984 (Orwell reference). Possibly an additional dead-man&#39;s switch or contingency.</p>

<p>Oct 18th: London Airport evacuated due to &quot;chemical attack&quot;, potentially used as cover to fly Assange out of country.</p>

<p>Oct 20th: <a href="/r/wikileaks">/r/wikileaks</a>, <a href="/r/dncleaks">/r/dncleaks</a>, <a href="/r/wikileakstaskforce">/r/wikileakstaskforce</a> and <a href="/r/nsaleaks">/r/nsaleaks</a> add 21 new moderators and remove previous mods, all threads about Assange going missing deleted since.</p>

<p>Oct 20th/21st: Wikileaks tweets 5 tweets with misspelled words. The incorrect letters spell &quot;HELP HIM&quot;. The Wikileaks twitter has never made a spelling error, let alone 5 in two days.</p>

<p>Oct 21st: Massive DDoS attack on US internet. Wikileaks tweets to imply the attack originates from its supporters, asking them to stop.</p>

<p>Oct 22nd: Gavin MacFadyen (mentor to Assange and key player in Wikileaks) dies of lung cancer.</p>

<p>Oct 22nd: Riseup.net (the email provider used for Wikileaks&#39; twitter account) deletes the means (certificate fingerprints) by which to authenticate their future communications.</p>

<p>Oct 23rd: Wikileaks Tweets poll asking how best to prove Assange is alive (he still hasn&#39;t appeared on video or at the window since).</p>

<p>Oct 24th: Wikileaks Tweets video of Assange and Michael Moore recorded in June.</p>

<p>Oct 26th: 4chan users successfully successfully decode their first message in Wikileak&#39;s blockchain. Threads are instantly flooded by shills saying that it&#39;s not worth looking into. The blockchain is blocked with fees and 43000 unconfirmed transactions appear in the mempool.</p>

<p>Nov 6th: Huge DDoS takes down Wikileaks for first time in years.</p>

<p>Nov 7th: Various entities notice hundreds of Podesta and DNC emails are missing from recent leaks, accessed with direct entry.</p>

<p>Nov 8th: Trump wins.</p>

<p>Nov 12th: Assange meets with Swedish prosecutor regarding rape allegations, lawyers barred from attending, meeting conducted via an Equadorian ambassador (not face to face).</p>

<p>Nov 14th: Wikileaks releases insurance files, SHA-256 hashes do not match those tweeted in October.</p>

<p>Nov 19th: Wikileaks twitter account <a href="https://mobile.twitter.com/wikileaks/status/799829999314468864">denies</a> the authenticity of a post claiming to be from a WL staffer and saying WL was compromised</p>

<p>Nov 19th: Riseup&#39;s canary update has been overdue for 3 days, indicating strongly they have been compromised and were issued a gag order.</p>

<p><del>EDIT: add to that the fact Riseup.net hasn&#39;t updated their canary (due a few days ago), suggesting they were compromised and gagged, and thus that the WL twitter account was compromised (Riseup provides the email WL uses for its Twitter account).</del></p>

<p>Edit2: added the Nov 19 bullet (WL twitter account denies allegations made on chan)</p>

<p>Edit3: added the 2 Riseup events (Oct 22 and Nov 23). See also this alternate (presumably improved/corrected) <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/5dl6wl/what_does_rconspiracy_make_of_this_wikileaks/da5j61n/">timeline</a>.

    <div class="md"><p>Somebody took the keys to Assange&#39;s dead man insurance file out of its nice box (ie, they found the message in the block chain, even though people tried discrediting it). </p>

<p>Then, someone took the key and threw it in a giant haystack to make sure people wouldn&#39;t find it (ie, intelligence agencies flooded the blockchain with tons of transactions).</p>

<p>And now, those keys are really, really hard to find and we need super smart people to try and find them. They&#39;re still there, though. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>can someone ELI5 - did the 4chaners manage to decrypt some files from the insurance / dead man switch? if so why couldnt they decrypt the rest? or did they only find 1 bit of it? should they have just kept quiet until they finished?</p>

<p>do we actually have the main explosive &quot;tell all dump&quot; somewhere? is it that 350gb torrent? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think one person managed to decode a message from it, but then they were suppressed and told &quot;it&#39;s nothing&quot; a million times.</p>

<p>I have no idea why they couldn&#39;t decrypt the rest, and I think they didn&#39;t keep quiet because they might&#39;ve wondered if they were crazy.</p>

<p>I think these are the keys to the &quot;tell all&quot; dump that, if found, could be opened.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Blockchain is the technology underlying bitcoin, i.e. bitcoin is but one application of the blockchain. The blockchain is essentially a distributed, cryptographic ledger.</p>

<p>In particular it offers a great way to distribute an authentifiable, timestamped message which would be virtually impossible to suppress. For example you&#39;d use the OP_RETURN field for doing so.</p>

<p>See <a href="https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/OP_RETURN">https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/OP_RETURN</a></p>

<p>I haven&#39;t personally checked such a message/key was broadcast by WL though. Currently on mobile, will do next week if nobody else debunks/verifies this in the mean time.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I posted the below comment on another timeline on r/whereisassange, and wish to post it here as well, because I believe it is the overt and direct threat that preceded all this:</p>

<p>I believe the timeline should include this document: <a href="https://www.wikileaks.org/IMG/pdf/toddandclare-emails-3-sep-2016-to-21-sep-2016.pdf">https://www.wikileaks.org/IMG/pdf/toddandclare-emails-3-sep-2016-to-21-sep-2016.pdf</a></p>

<p>I think it starts here because the surface content (blackmail, slander) and the ridiculously easy breadcrumbs (ToddandClare et al) were so blatantly amateurish and unbelievable; yet the underlying threats were overt and, I believe designed to communicate directly to JA something much more terrible and dire. They even gave a deadline: Oct 31.</p>

<p>Here is an example of the language used to convey a threat much more serious than slander and blackmail:</p>

<p>&quot;Our source has provided information that <strong>Julian’s stay in Ecuador will not be permanent. Exit visas are imminent onto London streets. This dramatic turn of events is planned to have a “spectacular” conclusion. If Julian wishes to avoid ADX Florence</strong>, we suggest he considers [etc]&quot;</p>

<p>*WL released this exchange not long before the SHTF</p>

<p>*Who knows about ADX Florence by name besides letter-agencies</p>

<p>But excluding all the &quot;proof&quot;, all the weird coincidences, the only 100% fact we have is that Assange is making proof of life very difficult to achieve and by doing so it is damaging the reputability of WikiLeaks. I cant see why anyone in Julians position wouldnt make it known to the public that he was safe, especially after all the fishiness thats been going on. I think hes dead. I hope hes not, but him being so weirdly reluctant to give us proof of life does nothing but confirm my suspicions. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>one thing i&#39;d like to note, from what I understand, at least one of the security backups has if something goes wrong and WL gets comprimised should have the decrypted files. From what I&#39;ve read the hashes are claimed to be from the decrypted files, so the only way to identify if the hashes are real for the insurance files is to be one of the ones who have the decrypted files. That is also assuming the hashes are from the decrypted files, so they could have been randomly made, the encrypted files can have been modified, or the ones in control of WL have access to the decrypted files, or WL had the hashes for the decrypted files laying around.</p>

<p>Im pretty sure none of this isnt easily confirmable or if not at all</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was online at the time it happened. People asked the same question you did only an hour or two later, and most links, even by then were broken. They were quick to delete anything involved. I wish I had screencapped some stuff, but I was busy tracking flightradar at the time. But I do recall seeing images of white vans (at least 3) with armed security, escorting a man with a black hood over his head. There was also an audio recording of a man calling the embassy asking about Assanges well-being, and the lady sounded very off about the whole thing. I am still constantly surprised that a crowd hasn&#39;t gathered at the Embassy, but I recall a lot of people at the time saying they were heading down there to look, and never following up on it. The whole thing is just so fucking weird, it gives me chills.</p>

<p>Had those files already dropped with all the original dates?
Has anyone looked to see if there is a file with that exact 1984 date in that non fiddled with drop of all these files? Something that might  be more important now Or even just 1984 actually dated files.
Please tell me someone saved them all before they were redropped with the gag date.</p>
