        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>This is a topic I was really into awhile ago and since researching international pedo rings is rough at best I decided to distract myself and offer the same to all of you.</p>

<p><strong>Binary Star Theory: Intro</strong></p>

<p>The talk of Nibiru, Planet X, or Nemesis has been around for a long time. A rapper even wrote a compelling song on the subject (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3UhjblIwfFM">Ab-Soul Nibiru</a>). This argument tries to abstain from pure speculation though.</p>

<p>Let&#39;s start with the &#39;wobbling&#39; observed in the earth. I learned early in school that the earth &#39;wobbled&#39; which is caused by the sun and the moon acting on our earth. The technical term is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axial_precession">axial precession</a>.</p>

<p><strong>The Proof</strong></p>

<p>The reason that I bring up axial precession is that it is measured by observing fixed points in the distance (typically quasars). If however we observe other planets within our solar system the &#39;wobble&#39; is not seen. <a href="http://binaryresearchinstitute.com/bri/evidence/the-lunar-cycle/">1</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Ironically, astronomers unknowingly recognize the two different frames at work when it comes to routine calculations within the solar system. For example, <strong>when they plot the position of planets or moons within the solar system they use a tropical frame, which by definition excludes precession (Footnote 2) thus no precession adjustment is required or even considered.</strong> However, when the position of a star needs to be found you first find the object at a point in time (say J2000) then add precession for each year that has passed since that point. Thus current ephemeris methods account for the two frames; precession is excluded when plotting objects within the solar system and included when plotting objects outside the solar system.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p><em>emphasis mine</em></p>

<p>If no &#39;wobble&#39; appears to be present on objects within our solar system it suggests that the whole system is experiencing axial precession. In order for our whole solar system to experience precession the most massive object in the solar system (the sun) would have to be in orbit with another celestial body (a star or small black hole).</p>

<p>An additional note is that most stars like our sun (yellow dwarfs) that we observe in the distance have a binary companion. <a href="http://voices.nationalgeographic.com/2014/09/26/astronomers-clue-in-to-why-binary-stars-are-so-bountiful/">2</a></p>

<p><a href="http://binaryresearchinstitute.com/bri/">Additional Info</a></p>

<p><strong>Criticism</strong></p>

<p>Since this theory is far from new it has had many <a href="http://www.space.com/22538-nemesis-star.html">critics</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;(T)he Sun is not part of a binary star system. There has never been any evidence to suggest a companion. The idea has been disproved by several infrared sky surveys, most recently the WISE mission. If there were a brown dwarf companion, these sensitive infrared telescopes would have detected it.&quot;
— David Morrison, Astrobiology Senior Scientist, October 17, 2012</p>
</blockquote>

<p>First of all this is a very definitive answer from a man who pursues knowledge. Second to state this is to say &quot;the absence of evidence, is evidence of absence&quot;. Third just because there weren&#39;t any brown dwarfs found, as I stated above, a black hole could be the suns binary companion of which we have no way to measure or detect. The only reason that we know that there is a black hole in the center of the milky way is by observing everything around the center. If we look at everything around <strong>us</strong> is it clear that the sun and the moon make everything in our solar system &#39;wobble&#39;?</p>

<p><strong>The Conspiracy</strong></p>

<p>In the end I feel that this theory could explain some things. Climate change; the sun heating as it <a href="https://wattsupwiththat.com/2015/03/10/study-climate-change-is-nothing-new-in-fact-it-was-happening-the-same-way-1-4-billion-years-ago/">always has</a> due to an approaching celestial body and the subsequent increase in gravitational force. Solar flares; also due to approaching celestial body and a &#39;ramp up&#39; in the suns energy production. And more. </p>

<p>Basically TPTB have hidden this behind a multitude of complicated reasons to ensure calmness.</p>

<p>I&#39;d like to say thanks for reading my first post here. I plan on doing one later about the Decentralization of Information but for now descend back into this hellish crowd sourced investigation.</p>

<p>Which causes icy objects, ie comets and the like to dislodge, on long elliptical journeys towards our Sun.</p>

<p>The tie to alpha centauri is new but ill try following it with the app on my phone. (in theory a binary companion would move slightly different then other stars in the sky. The wiki you posted doesn&#39;t mention our solar system as being a member of that star group though. Do you possibly have a link to the HTYW episode?</p>

<p>This is true, just a plausible theory that objects in our neighbors star group could interact with objects far out in our system. Lots of what we know about the universe is theory and we perfect those theories as our tools/technology/analysis get more advanced and we can observe more of how the universe works.</p>

<p>Looking for it.</p>

<p>Might want to ask <a href="/r/science">/r/science</a></p>

<p>The one thing I think that is plausible about global warming being a misguided notion is that our planet has gone through phases of ice ages and worse catastrophes that we don&#39;t prepare for.</p>

<p>We are too distracted by the immediate scare mongering.</p>

<p>Here are some links:</p>

<p>The key here is, look at the big 5, and diversity of life. When diversity of life goes down, that means shit hit the fan. Big rock fell from the sky or some volcanic disturbance blocked the sky, etc.
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extinction_event#Patterns_in_frequency">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extinction_event#Patterns_in_frequency</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ohhh this got my synapses all fired up. </p>

<p>The big 5 part: if it&#39;s true the precession of the equinoxes is a ~26,000 yr cycle, since binary stars have elliptical orbits, could it be that the ~62 million year cycle seen in the big 5 is a result of both cosmic bodies being at their closest. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It could me.   I don&#39;t know the science behind calculating a 62 million year orbit but i imagine it isn&#39;t easy, but it could be something gets close to our system on that cycle and causes large rocks etc to start falling from the sky.

    <div class="md"><p>The jump to &quot;the entire solar system must be wobbling&quot; seems like a leap of logic.  Couldn&#39;t there be a much more &quot;practical&quot; explanation?  i.e.  Nearby objects don&#39;t need the same precision to spot as extremely distant objects, mixed with a variety of other extremely distant objects?<br/>
The precessional cycle is 26000 years, so the differences in mapping would be very slight, and only useful for pinpointing distant stars, and not getting them mixed up with the myriad of other stars you would observe in the same basic area.
I&#39;m no expert in this area, and I&#39;m just thinking out loud, so feel free to share how you feel I may be mistaken. :)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Very good read thanks for sharing.</p>

<p>I never knew that the wobble was not scene in planets within our own solar system. This actually raises a red flag for me. How could we notice the wobble on far off objects but not on nearby objects. You would think we would notice it more on nearby objects right?</p>

<p>Something doesn&#39;t add up.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Why would it explain climate change, wouldn&#39;t the historical temperatures NOT have spiked in the past century? Every time the earth completes a cycle the effect of this other star&#39;s pull should push us further to whatever side it&#39;s on, so the temperatures would still go and up and down on a yearly basis.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Brown dwarfs are substellar objects that occupy the mass range between the heaviest gas giants</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So it shouldn&#39;t have more of an effect on our axial velocity than Jupiter, and it&#39;s clearly far enough away that we can&#39;t just see it</p>

<p>Also no other method is used to locate this star, like it&#39;s brightness:
<a href="http://physicsworld.com/cws/article/news/2015/jul/31/brown-dwarfs-powerful-auroras-shine-bright">http://physicsworld.com/cws/article/news/2015/jul/31/brown-dwarfs-powerful-auroras-shine-bright</a></p>

<p>Why would this need to be suppressed? Wouldn&#39;t it just be a cool fact to the average person? last month people were talking about signals that could&#39;ve been produced by a civilization far away, and yet people forgot in a week. </p>

<p>This sounds fake.</p>

<p>If it&#39;s real</p>

<p>it would affect the sun, solarwind/spaceweather, the earth&#39;s magnetosphere and core.

    <div class="md"><p>I got ridiculed talking about this in r/space..but we have seen a decreasing magnetosphere as of late (from 5% decrease a century to 5% decrease A DECADE).. as well as an increase in earthquake activity, floods etc. This sounds nuts...but sunsets and sunrises have been INCREDIBLY red lately and the sun is almost always &quot;blocked&quot; by what looks like Geo engineering.

    <div class="md"><p>First of all I&#39;m saying that it &quot;could&quot; be an explanation of climate change. The idea comes from the formula that relates to the energy production of a star. <a href="https://gyazo.com/394d168c46cec970f28533b08ccde3fa">Here</a> <a href="http://www.astro.caltech.edu/%7Egeorge/ay20/Ay20-Lec7x.pdf">Source</a></p>

<p>Basically the energy production is relative to internal pressure which is regulated by energy production. So should external pressure (ie Gravity) increase, due to another celestial body moving closer to the <strong>sun</strong> (not sure where you got the idea i was talking about another sun affecting our earth directly) the gravity on the sun would increase. An increase in external gravity means increase in energy production which could lead to a warming of our earth.</p>

<li><p>I was referring to the dots consistently thrown out (in the new section) without anyone connecting them. There&#39;s no conspiracy with no connections.</p></li>
<li><p>Seeing as cosmic revelations were a large part of the propellant for the scientific revolution through to the industrial revolution I believe TPTB would like to be in control of the time and context in which these revelations about our universe are revealed. Considering how hard the church came down on Magellan and Galileo in their times I wouldn&#39;t consider it far fetched to assume a power such as the church (eg. TPTB) postured themselves to be in control of these cosmic discoveries.  </p></li>

<p>The tie to alpha centauri is new but ill try following it with the app on my phone. (in theory a binary companion would move slightly different then other stars in the sky. The wiki you posted doesn&#39;t mention our solar system as being a member of that star group though. Do you possibly have a link to the HTYW episode?</p>
