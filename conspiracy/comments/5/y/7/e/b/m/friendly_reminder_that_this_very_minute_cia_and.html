<p>but read op&#39;s history....</p>

<p>im not even being facetious here, he worries me very much</p>

<p>i work with people with paranoid schizophrenia and his writings read a <em>lot</em> like other writings ive seen from clients</p>

<p>im being completely serious here. He sounds increasing delusional and paranoid and dangerous</p>

<p>unless he&#39;s just a <em>very</em> accomplished troll who is taking on the character of a stereotypical &quot;crazy&quot; conspiracy theorist...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It sounds like you, being in the helping profession, already know how important it is to evaluate suspected mental illness to discern a clinical diagnosis.  Clearly, we can&#39;t do that on Reddit.</p>

<p>And if you&#39;re posting here, then you probably realize that true psychiatric illness is the most common -- but not only -- cause for such claims.  I believe there are many people who&#39;ve been diagnosed with schizophrenia, paranoia, and many other conditions that manifest down to the letter of the DSM4/5, but with a spiritual root cause rather than physical.</p>

<p>One condition misdiagnosed for decades was MPD / DID.  The medical community is finally starting to realize that this illness in particular <em>almost always</em> is a result of repetitive, extreme trauma, usually in childhood.  Many, including myself (not in that profession, but I take an interest in this topic) believe these are intentionally-created cases.  And one of many responsible parties has its home base at Langley.</p>

<p>Be that as it may, the OP needs help one way or the other.  By the by, my post wasn&#39;t in contradiction to you in any way -- I suspect you share similar ideas.  I have a broader audience in mind.</p>
</div>

<div class="comment mb-3 ml-5" data-depth="5" data-id="deo9e5o">
    <p class="byline text-muted mb-0"><a href="javascript:;" class="score"><span class="badge badge-secondary">n/a</span></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a class="author" href="../../../../../../../../user/deplorable_oracle.html">deplorable_oracle</a> 2017-03-08</p>
    <div class="md"><p>Also, forgot to mention this:</p>

<p>I have this friend who is very much mentally healthy, and by no means would anyone accuse him of being a conspiracy theorist.  I&#39;ve known the man since we were kids, and have never seen any indication of paranoia.  But he confided in me a similar story to the OP -- that he started dating a girl who he later found out worked for the NSA.  He claims that when he broke up with her, she went bat-s**t insane, and that for years afterwards, he felt targeted.</p>

<p>His emails would be completely removed from his Gmail.  He&#39;d be on the phone with someone and a third party would then say something and the line would drop.  He&#39;d be walking down the street, and suddenly three or four guys would start following him literally everywhere for hours.</p>

<p>I found it hard to believe, and when he first told me, I informed him that the NSA didn&#39;t have the purview to conduct unwarranted operations on a US citizen, and they certainly didn&#39;t have it <em>anywhere</em> in the organization to stalk / harass anyone.  At the time, I was working in the intel world and still hadn&#39;t realized all the deep stuff that was going on.</p>

<p>But he doesn&#39;t share it with anyone, he doesn&#39;t make crazy claims, and I&#39;ve come to believe him.  I&#39;ve also read of similar accounts from various people across the country.</p>

<p>My point is, perhaps what OP is saying could have an element of truth, even if there&#39;s a concomitant mental issue at play.  What if many of these crazy-sounding claims could be taken at face value? </p>

<p>The day these people are arrested</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No. Those people had their chance at life, and used it to bring additional pain and suffering to the world. I used a good portion of mine to bring in an unpaid non profit to help the homeless get out of their jams, how little it may of helped, but I tried. I also operated a business these monstrous cia nsa fucks destroyed, and my business was small, but honest, no fraud or anything.</p>

<p>They took their time, and used their fancy tech to destroy these things, drug me, perform psycological war on lil-ol&#39; me, and do various other bad things. These are the nsa and cia.</p>

<p>No, they had their time, and all arrests will do is allow them to continue waste our planet&#39;s resources. They must be expunged from existence, and not allowed further time to use our resources, or allowed the possibility to continue to bring pain to our species. </p>

<p>If we are fortunate enough to see such efforts taken place, there must be consideration taken so that innocent people are not hurt (anyone outside of these two organizations).</p>

<p>The only reason why I&#39;m so casual about my rhetoric is that I&#39;ve met these people, face to face, man to man, man to woman. When they aren&#39;t hiding behind their computers and fancy tools, or cars, they&#39;re cowards through and through, just as we&#39;d expect them to be. Sure, they probably have a few badasses, but when you see the tiny pinpricks their pupils turn to when they think they might be living in their last moments and they come to realize the evil that they are, and represent, they are complete disgusting cowards.</p>

<p>Yeah, they can kill me at any time, hell maybe they can from space now, who knows, and I&#39;m okay with this. I&#39;m ready to die, and it&#39;s so freeing, but all I really want is my mother fucking passport and for my dog and I to begin a new life on another continent. </p>

<p>Ah, another fake botted account. <a href="/u/Prismos_1st">/u/Prismos_1st</a> </p>

<p>To everyone else: There are various ways to spot these accounts, this one here, do you see his commenting pattern? Skipping every few days&#39;ish? It&#39;s a botted and purchased account, often used by nsa / cia scumbags, or marketing teams.</p>

<p>Now this isn&#39;t always the case, but it&#39;s pretty common. There are a few other patterns as well. Keep an eye out for the enemy of We the People, and call them out. </p>

<p>No, it&#39;s pretty much impossible to stop these new Nazis at this point.</p>

<p>The best we can hope for, that I hope for, is that Mattis performs a coup with the Marines, and maybe another arm of the military joins, like the Navy or Air Force, and we take back our nation.</p>

<p>Maybe that could never happen, but a man can dream.</p>

<p>The best course of action, unfortunately, is to obtain your passport, leave the nation, and attempt to help build up another nation in the name of good.</p>

<p>This is a bit a philisophical debate I suppose.</p>

<p>I&#39;m in the camp of wishing that all of them, all of those who comprise these horrible things are expelled from the planet. They knew, they may have not liked it, but they have known at least a little that they were and are a part of the new Nazi SS.</p>

<p>They had time to leave, have time to leave, now!</p>

<p>Maybe they are like me and cannot leave. Hell, I&#39;m trying to leave the New United States but they keep blocking my passport, and if it doesn&#39;t get here quickly, it&#39;s going to end badly. </p>

<p>Maybe none of them, and many of us, are allowed to escape the New United States now.</p>

<p>Has anyone else here actually tried to get their passports in the last few months? Is it possible? Are the rest of you a prisoner here like me? If so, maybe it&#39;s time for the prisoners to do what must be done to set things right again.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>OK, so if you check out my post history, you&#39;ll see I&#39;m not a shill or disinfo agent.  But I do need to point out that the average employee -- both federal and contractor -- at the CIA and NSA is no different than you and I.  I know some of them actively post here in good faith, and you&#39;d never know they worked for the IC.  Tens of thousands of employees across several agencies, and most of them are good, honest, decent people.  Let me give you some inside perspective:</p>

<p>I spent several years as a federal civilian working for a joint IC / military-intel organization.  I routinely collaborated with agencies you know of -- CIA, NSA, NGA, DIA -- and those you don&#39;t.  There were regular conferences at various organizations, at which I met and maintained contact with many people across the entire swath of the IC.  And in all my years, I never personally encountered a single instance of an intentional violation of constitutional rights or court opinions related to privacy.  Clearly, we all know it does happen.  But you have to remember that the average analyst is following the law and his / her conscience as an American citizen while working a difficult job to provide for his / her family.</p>

<p>Every program and project is very compartmentalized.  The Manhattan Project employed over 129,000 people, but just a few dozen had the information on the whole scope of the project.  Think about it: only .018% of those involved understood the whole story.  A vast majority of people working it, including many who were fully cleared to the highest levels of classification -- research scientists, maintenance crews, construction workers, shipping and transportation, mining, parts and assembly -- knew only as much as was required to do their job.  And how much more time have we had to perfect the art of compartmentalization?</p>

<p>I know we have cause for concern, and we should be very angry.  Our rights have indeed be violated over and over again.  But trust me when I tell you that most people working for these agencies have no clue how their work serves the bigger picture, and most are subject to the same cognitive bias as everyone else, which means that most of them will see the evidence and continue to deny it.</p>

<p>That said, it brings up an issue of larger concern.  Whoever leaked this information still only has access to a very small part.  I cannot confirm nor deny the veracity of the recent leaks, but I can tell you with certainty that they are but a <em>fraction</em> of the truth.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s a hard one!</p>

<p>Like today there&#39;s a guy, going around my little circle house area, I asked him what his business was, he didn&#39;t see the knife I had out, he said he was looking for a stolen car, and it was good that he answered as quick as he did that it was a missing 68 mustang, or I probably would have cut him up pretty bad.</p>

<p>It&#39;s a dangerous game. I never wanted to play it, not sure why I&#39;m in it, and I&#39;m making efforts to peacefully exit, but if I see them fucking with me, I will kill them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Also I didn&#39;t know about the DIA or NGA. Like I&#39;ve suggested, I always kind of stayed away from that stuff, or didn&#39;t even try. It wasn&#39;t my business, no need to get involved.</p>

<p>The only reason I&#39;m full of so much fire is that they ruined my life, tried to murder me, tried to make me into a terrorist, tried to kill my dog even, the fuckers.</p>

<p>They still have people stalk me, I don&#39;t really get why though. God damn this is so stupid, and if I don&#39;t get that mother fucking passport quickly, they cannot stop, and they know this, it&#39;s a work of art, sometimes caution can pay dividends.</p>

<p>... but hopefully I just get my passport and am able to leave to another nation with my dog, in peace. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The idea behind Fordism is that if you taught you worker how to build the entire car, they&#39;d just leave your company and do it for themselves.</p>

<p>So instead of teaching people to build entire cars, you teach them individually to build wheels, mirrors, seatbelts etc. so each person has a job they do, but they all contribute to the bigger task at hand without understanding the finished product.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ah, I see your point about Fordism -- thanks for the clarification.</p>

<p>However, I believe there&#39;s a major distinction here in that in practice, the guy making steering wheels in the assembly line knows everything there is to know about steering wheels, including how it fits into the steering column, what components attach to them, and where it goes in the car.  He also knows its overall intended function within the context of the completed end product, and very likely quite a bit about many of the other individual components.  He may or may not know much about the specific details about other parts, or how the car actually functions on the mechanical level, but he gets the overall picture.</p>

<p>In the intel community, the corresponding analogy would be of that same guy who knows everything there is to know about steering wheels, but his abstract contextual knowledge is limited to the fact that someone will eventually place their hands on it.  He doesn&#39;t know where the wheels go in a completed product, what its intended function will actually be, how its going to be specifically used, to what and where it will be attached, or exactly why he was asked to make steering wheels in the first place.  He is literally in a silo with respect to every aspect of his work.</p>

<p>Now, it IS difficult to draw that analogy in the case of the IC because truth be told, there are a lot of smart people there who do collaborate and interact with each other.  But the concept holds that the individual analyst really doesn&#39;t know who&#39;s reading his assessments, how his products will be used, what decisions are being made by whom based on his work, etc, etc.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Just because intelligence community members are too short-sighted to understand what is going on doesn&#39;t cleanse them of wrongdoing. Anyone can play stupid.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Perhaps because I&#39;ve worked alongside many of them, and have been able to discern their humanity and general desire to do actual good, but I simply find your assessment far too broad and overly-critical.  The enemy is <strong>not</strong> the guy working day to day in a cramped cubicle in a dark, windowless room so that he can feed his family.  The enemies are those who have hunger for power and control, complete disregard for the common good and constitutional freedoms, authority to guide intelligence directives, authority to make intelligence-based decisions, and a full grasp of the whole picture.</p>

<p>They are much fewer in number than you seem to think.  Dangerous, yes.  Evil, yes.  Abundant and/or apparent?  No.</p>
