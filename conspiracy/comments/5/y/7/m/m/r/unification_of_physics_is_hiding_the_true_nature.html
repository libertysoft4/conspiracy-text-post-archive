        <p><span class="badge badge-primary">63</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;2017-03-08 by <a class="author" href="../../../../../../../../user/d8_thc.html">d8_thc</a></p>
        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>So where to begin?</p>

<p>Let me start out by stating the bottom line - matter is holographic. What do I mean by this?</p>

<p>I mean that each and every atom contains the mass/information of every other atom in the Universe, <strong>literally.</strong></p>

<p>Unification of relativity and quantum field theory will show our Universe is self-entangled at all scales - micro-wormholes that connect the entire Universe into what we could probably call a singularity - i.e. at the most basic level of reality, all matter is touching at length=0 geometrically. A self-referential, evolving holographic matrix of information. </p>

<p><a href="http://i.imgur.com/9KbOY4q.jpg">Indra&#39;s Net (pic)</a> got it right - this may help you understand the following text</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Far away in the heavenly abode of the great god Indra, there is a wonderful net which has been hung by some cunning artificer in such a manner that it stretches out infinitely in all directions. In accordance with the extravagant tastes of deities, the artificer has hung a single glittering jewel in each &quot;eye&quot; of the net, and since the net itself is infinite in dimension, the jewels are infinite in number. There hang the jewels, glittering &quot;like&quot; stars in the first magnitude, a wonderful sight to behold. If we now arbitrarily select one of these jewels for inspection and look closely at it, we will discover that in its polished surface there are reflected all the other jewels in the net, infinite in number. Not only that, but each of the jewels reflected in this one jewel is also reflecting all the other jewels, so that there is an infinite reflecting process occurring.[5]</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So let&#39;s start with some knowns:</p>

<p>We know for a fact that our physics is incomplete - we cannot model the large by the small parts we know to make it up.</p>

<p>We know for a fact that our models and hypothesis for how consciousness arises is incomplete, and contrary to what a neuroscientist might say, &#39;Consciousness as an epiphenomenon of brain activity alone&#39; is just as much as a belief as anything else.</p>

<p>So how could it be possible that protons are holographic?</p>

<p>There are a few mainstream physics theories that have been combined, to show that the quantum vacuum is riddled with wormholes - you may have heard the terms quantum foam - describing a turbulent vacuum manifold in which distant parts of spacetime are connecting and disconnecting extremely quickly, creating a network of bridges through space.</p>

<p>Well there is another theory called the holographic principle, which postulates that the surface of a black hole can encode all of the information in the volume, geometrically.</p>

<p>By combining these theories, and a bit of a twist in the spacetime manifold, we can show that mass arises as a function of information, for example the information of a single proton vs the information of all protons entangled with it. Remember in e=mc<sup>2</sup> we have no definitions for any of the terms, we have equivalence, but &#39;what is energy? what is mass? remain unanswered.</p>

<p>The most important concept to this whole holographic proton thing is something called a planck unit. A planck unit is a fundamental set of measurements that define the &#39;quanta&#39; that makes up fields such as electromagnetism.</p>

<p>Electromagnetic waves are not sent as a continuous radiation, it is actually discrete quanta - packets of energy. This is what &#39;quantum&#39; is. This planck sized quanta has a mass, a length, and a time - its simply a wave fluctuation - the most fundamental one our Universe does - as utilizing this planck&#39;s constant solves many of our equations such as the amount of energy put out from a blackbody radation source (when a continuous wave is used, we yield infinite energy, when planck sized quanta are used, it comes out perfectly).</p>

<p>When we add up how many planck unit masses there should be in empty space, we get 10<sup>93</sup> grams / cm<sup>3</sup> of space.</p>

<p>This is so high, its simply written off. It&#39;s the planck density, and it&#39;s supposed to be the energy of the vacuum, since electromagnetic fields permeate the entire Universe. You may hear this referred to as &#39;virtual particles&#39; or even &#39;zero point energy&#39;. It breaks everything, so it&#39;s dismissed as an artifact of the math - it&#39;s simply cancelled out.</p>

<p>The first thing we will &#39;change&#39; from mainstream physics is using a sphericalized planck unit as the basis of the structure of the vacuum - an omnidirectional lattice of overlapping planck spherical units, which are the diameter of the planck length and mass of the planck mass - this is opposed to the cubic packing normally used.</p>

<p>This overlapping circles grid may be familiar to you, and that&#39;s because it&#39;s been blasted on the walls of temples for centuries - the famed flower of life.</p>

<p>Remember these are quanta, so if we could extract the mass of matter from these fundamental units, we have a quantum gravity theory on our hands.</p>

<p>So what happens when we take the proton volume, and see how many planck spherical units (PSUs) fit inside?</p>

<p>We get 10<sup>60,</sup> which multiplied by the planck mass just so happens to be 10<sup>55</sup> grams, which just so happens to be the estimated mass of the Universe.</p>

<p>Remember, the planck mass and planck length are non-anthropomorphically defined, these are constants that come out of other constants.</p>

<p>So remember the holographic principle? If each proton contains the mass of all protons holographically, maybe we can apply it and see why each individual proton only <em>expresses</em> a tiny amount locally, the rest mass of a proton is 10<sup>-24</sup> grams.</p>

<p>If we take the amount that fit on the surface (10<sup>40),</sup> and divide the amount that fit in the volume (10<sup>60)</sup> - and multiply 2 * planck mass, we nail the standard mass of the proton at 10<sup>-24</sup> grams.</p>

<p>The &#39;mass&#39; of a proton is it&#39;s information content &#39;versus&#39; the information content of the protons it&#39;s surface planck units are entangled with. Mass is a fundamental information ratio.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/holofractal/comments/3bzsyl/since_i_wrote_this_out_in_a_comment_might_as_well/?ref=search_posts">Here</a> is the wolfram math for all of this</p>

<p>There are other things to note with this calculation, namely you can go backwards from rest mass -&gt; radius, and deduce a new proton radius which has recently been confirmed by the most accurate proton radius experiment to date at the Paul Scherrer Institute. This deviates some 4% from standard model predictions.</p>

<p>So let&#39;s take it back to the wormhole structure of space. Because space is actually teeming with an exorbitant amount of energy (planck density), we create something known as a Bose Einstein Condensate, a property that allows for macro-quantum effects - the vacuum of space allows for wormholes to crisscross the entire Universe, simply because of the amount of energy in each point - entangling all protons. </p>

<p>In other words, imagine that there is enough mass at each point in space to create tiny black holes that string together to form a wormhole, which is essentially what a wormhole is - a stretched black hole. If it helps to imagine space as a lattice of fiber lines - this works too, just remember there is 0 latency for information to cross the entire Universe. </p>

<p>So - each surface PSU on the proton is a termination of a wormhole that goes right through the BEC structure of space, and to another proton. 10<sup>40</sup> surface connections lead to 10<sup>40</sup> protons, each leading to 10<sup>40,</sup> which gives us 10<sup>80,</sup> which is the estimated amount of particles in the Universe.</p>

<p>So - each proton contains the mass of the Universe holographically, however only a tiny amount is expressed locally, the rest is instantly distributed throughout this wormhole network of space.</p>

<p>The surface wormhole network of a proton acts as a sort of information buffer that can only allow a very tiny amount of the vacuum fluctuations in the proton to be expressed locally. </p>

<p>There is a specific geometry for the sphere packing of empty space that allows for the immense energy to be unperceivable, but for now we can simply think of the difference between matter and vacuum is that matter is simply co-moving, spinning vacuum - spinning PSU&#39;s, spinning light.</p>

<p>The implications of this theory are astounding. For one, it implicates morphic resonance, which is a theory by a prominent biologist (Rupert Sheldrake) that postulates there is an unseen field that stretches the Universe, and allows for resonance between form/matter - allowing for example rats on one side of the world to solve a maze faster after it has been done by rats they have no contact with.</p>

<p>However, this goes beyond biology. This same mechanism is the explanation for cosmological evolution, why the Universe seems to be continually complexifying.</p>

<p>Whatever forms &#39;work&#39; in the Universe become more prevalent in the holographic singularities, allowing the blueprint of the form that works to be more easily duplicated through resonance, creating a feedback/feedforward system in the structure of space itself - which leads to cosmological evolution - from cosmogenesis to consciousness.</p>

<p>Each proton acting like a sort of &#39;tuning fork&#39; that can more easily duplicate form that acts against entropy - this leads to the evolution of matter into more and more interconnected complex systems.</p>

<p>There are three very important papers that lay this theory all out (this is <em>not</em> my theory)</p>

<p>The original paper solving quantum gravity via a holographic proton</p>

<p><a href="http://resonance.is/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/1367405491-Haramein342013PRRI3363.pdf">Quantum Gravity and The Holographic Mass</a></p>

<p>Extension of the holographic solution which solves for all elements and the electron mass
<a href="http://haramein.resonance.is/wp-content/uploads/EHM.pdf">Electron and the Holographic Mass</a></p>

<p>A paper detailing the cosmological evolution, and the Universe&#39;s evolution towards consciousness as an intrinsic part of the Holographic Universe
<a href="http://15qrvx2p7q0ipwico11bd3e1.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/The-Unified-Spacememory-Network-__-Haramein-Brown-Val-Baker-__-July-2016.pdf">The Unified Spacememory Network</a></p>

<p>The implications for the occult are also astounding. The holographic nature of consciousness and matter allows for collective coherence, shared consciousness patterns that behave just like memes in the real world - these can be looked at as the &#39;archons&#39; that are discussed here - essentially electromagnetic patterns in the holographic mass in which human consciousness interacts -super archetypical patterns or discrete consciousness&#39; that can be manipulated or &#39;fed&#39; by focusing energy.</p>

<p>However, the reverse is also true. Chanting for example - people &#39;imprinting&#39; a feeling-state along with a chant into the holographic mass, will allow others to pickup on this &#39;archon&#39; via resonance in the holographic mass.</p>

<p>This goes on and on and on - but this <em>is</em> the theory that knits everything together in a logical, intuitive, mystical package - it has helped the cohesiveness of my worldview in a tremendous way.</p>

<p>I hope you take some time to look into this theory, it took me months before I accepted it as correct. All I can ask is an open mind and heart!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hey - thanks. I also agree all roads lead to the nature of existence.</p>

<p>First I have to say this isn&#39;t my theory, I&#39;m a huge advocate of it because I believe it will lead the rational fold into more understanding of unity.</p>

<p>This has been developed by Nassim Haramein and the <a href="http://resonance.is">Resonance Science Foundation</a> who have plenty of PHd&#39;s - the papers have also been co-written by Elizabeth Rauscher, an extremely accomplished nuclear physicist. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>What are your thoughts on theory of relativity ?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I believe it is incomplete, and the missing links are to due with spin.</p>

<p>i.e. we can all imagine the funnel down to a black hole which is supposed to describe gravitation.</p>

<p>Nassim has added torsion or spin into the Einstein Field Equations, so space isn&#39;t just curving towards mass, it&#39;s also spinning. If you imagine a water vortex going down the drain - current theory describes the curvature of the vortex, but Nassim&#39;s theory explains the bulk spin of all of the water molecules curling, causing the curve (of course replace water with space and water molecules with quantum field / PSUs).</p>

<p>Thats off by 3 orders of magnitude.</p>

<p>What I would recommend to you is to get a degree in physics or math. If you sincerely believe this is all true, make your mark in history. Prove something mathematically or even better, demonstrate something physically through direct or indirect observation. But above all, approach the problem without a preconceived notion of what the result is going to be. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>10<sup>-24</sup> grams is how I wrote it - it&#39;s not the actual result.</p>

<p>There&#39;s already been a prediction - </p>

<p>The holographic equation is an equivalency of radius&lt;&gt;mass - much like the Schwarzchild Solution.</p>

<p>You can obviously either plug in either one.</p>

<p>When we use our mass measurements, which are extremely precise, we get a radius that differs slightly from the standard model.</p>

<p>Using the accepted CODATA radius we get about 4% difference from the mass.</p>

<p>HOWEVER</p>

<p>A prediction was made of a radius that has recently been practically confirmed with the latest muonic hydrogen accelerator experiments in Switzerland - which also differs from standard model by about 4%. This prediction was made by using the CODATA mass in the holographic equation to yield a radius.</p>

<p>Using this new charge radius derived by the Paul Scherrer Institute, the mass measurements come within 0.00072 * 10<sup>-24</sup> grams. Within .042% of CODATA.</p>

<p>The radius prediction <em>may in fact be correct</em> considering we are using fundamental units, and as our radius measurements get closer, we get closer and closer to the exact mass measurements. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Personally, I don&#39;t think its a good idea to be an apologist for fields that you do not have a foundational understanding of. I work in academia. It is a very strange place, full of massive egos and certified geniuses. Sometimes the two go hand in hand, other times they are miles apart. Trying to explain theoretical physics as a layperson to other laypersons, you are fundamentally misrepresenting the science. Neither of us is qualified to evaluate the rigorousness of the authors methods or understand the underlying science and math concepts. At that point it becomes an exercise in accepting the information you are being given based on faith. You can chose to believe it is true, but why evangelize for a subject you don&#39;t fully understand? I don&#39;t believe or disbelieve any of this stuff, its just foolish to me to adamantly believe in something I can&#39;t verify myself or seen verified through clear observation/demonstration.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t mean to insinuate that you are not intelligent enough or anything of that kind, so please dont take it that way, but I think there are huge misconceptions about what constitutes foundational scientific knowledge. My work is in aquatic chemistry and isotope geochemistry. I&#39;ve spent the past 8 years studying these things, and I am scratching the surface. As far quantum physics goes, there is a requisite level of math necessary to understand the theories. Without that math, you are left with crude metaphors that attempt to take phenomena we are familiar with and impose that on quantum behavior. It really doesn&#39;t work too well. Due to the fact that the field is still &#39;emerging&#39;, there is a massive level of &#39;bullshitability&#39; simply because there might be 1-2 people on earth actually studying a certain area. This is true of most emerging fields. After a few decades we usually figure out what was right and what was wrong. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I understand.</p>

<p>The only understanding of the Universe useful to me is my own. I can be told that someone somewhere knows how it works, that the world is made of quarks and gluons and mesons and bosons but it doesn&#39;t do anything for me.</p>

<p>This theory I can intuitively follow from inception, mechanically and logically - knitting together my views on spirituality, esotericism, ancient knowledge, and modern physics.</p>

<p>I just want to share it, in case it also resonates with others. If it doesn&#39;t - great, if it does, well then I&#39;ve helped someone gain a more holistic view of the world that will hopefully help propel the evolution of our species, even by an infinitesimal amount. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I just think its disingenuous to &#39;sell&#39; it as an equivalent or alternative to things like particle physics. Its technically a religion. Unfortunately, for most people, science is a religion. All science that you are not intimately studying, you have to take on good faith, accepting that our experts are doing good science. So in some sense you have to have faith in the scientific process, but while the evidence is uniquely manifest countless times, something like these theories requires a more heavy dose of faith. </p>

<p>Personally I am not against this type of faith, but I think it should be presented as what it is, in the same way that the 7 day creation story from the bible should not be read as a textbook alternative to evolution and geohistory. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Where is faith in the equation? To me it is extremely more concrete than say LQCD (which is unsolved)</p>

<p>It is logical. It is mechanical. It has no free parameters. It&#39;s an entropic theory of gravity, an information theory approach.</p>

<p>It uses numbers with 60 zeroes to get within one sigma of measured values.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hey - thanks. I also agree all roads lead to the nature of existence.</p>

<p>First I have to say this isn&#39;t my theory, I&#39;m a huge advocate of it because I believe it will lead the rational fold into more understanding of unity.</p>

<p>This has been developed by Nassim Haramein and the <a href="http://resonance.is">Resonance Science Foundation</a> who have plenty of PHd&#39;s - the papers have also been co-written by Elizabeth Rauscher, an extremely accomplished nuclear physicist. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>What are your thoughts on theory of relativity ?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I believe it is incomplete, and the missing links are to due with spin.</p>

<p>i.e. we can all imagine the funnel down to a black hole which is supposed to describe gravitation.</p>

<p>Nassim has added torsion or spin into the Einstein Field Equations, so space isn&#39;t just curving towards mass, it&#39;s also spinning. If you imagine a water vortex going down the drain - current theory describes the curvature of the vortex, but Nassim&#39;s theory explains the bulk spin of all of the water molecules curling, causing the curve (of course replace water with space and water molecules with quantum field / PSUs).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Personally, I don&#39;t think its a good idea to be an apologist for fields that you do not have a foundational understanding of. I work in academia. It is a very strange place, full of massive egos and certified geniuses. Sometimes the two go hand in hand, other times they are miles apart. Trying to explain theoretical physics as a layperson to other laypersons, you are fundamentally misrepresenting the science. Neither of us is qualified to evaluate the rigorousness of the authors methods or understand the underlying science and math concepts. At that point it becomes an exercise in accepting the information you are being given based on faith. You can chose to believe it is true, but why evangelize for a subject you don&#39;t fully understand? I don&#39;t believe or disbelieve any of this stuff, its just foolish to me to adamantly believe in something I can&#39;t verify myself or seen verified through clear observation/demonstration.</p>
