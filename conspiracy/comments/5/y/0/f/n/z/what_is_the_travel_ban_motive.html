They have big oil and coal&#39;s money in their back pocket and their motive is to spread lies so people keep supporting oil and coal.</p>

<p>Similarly, I believe there is a hidden motive for this travel ban republicans keep supporting. They KNOW the majority of terrorist attacks come internally from American citizens, so the ban will essentially do nothing to prevent them.</p>

<p>My question is why are they really so supportive of this ban? What is the real motive, as it obviously won&#39;t prevent what it claims to exist for.</p>

<p>His executive orders are doing nothing but fueling more terrorist attacks. The majority, if not all of ISIS attacks we&#39;ve had in this country are from our own citizens, and the countries that he banned have no history attacking our nation. It makes zero sense.</p>

<p>Now the country that HAS had civilians attack us that he left out of the order is Saudi Arabia. Funny that.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I wasn&#39;t calling you that... the world leaders who oppose him are. </p>

<p>The policies of previous Presidents have fueled attacks, as evidenced by the attacks happening before Trump took office. And the attacks from our own citizens are by people who sympathize with ISIS, based partly on those policies - which Trump opposes. </p>

<p>Trump is obviously in favor of isolationism and not getting involved in these countries in the first place. He doesn&#39;t want to take them over like Bush, Clinton and Obama did... I don&#39;t think it can get worse with ISIS, but we can do what we must to stop the flow of refugees so that we can try to find better solutions.</p>

<p>Besides any of that, ISIS is a CIA creation, as was Al Qaeda... sure there are &#39;true believers&#39;, but they are were all funded by the US and it&#39;s allies - as Rep. Tulsi Gabbard has been trying to alert us to.</p>

<p>I agree about Saudi Arabia though... and as I said, I do believe there are bad people who are trying to influence him. The motives of Saudi Arabia Wahhabists and Israeli Mossad are much more obvious to people in this sub than other places. </p>

<p>What policies do you mean? From everything I heard Obama talk about he was pretty open to Muslims entering the country. The Muslim hate was around regardless of the president, and if anything Trump has increased that hatred.</p>

<p>Seems you haven&#39;t been keeping up? The hijackers <em>wouldn&#39;t</em> make it in now. The vetting has improved. Saudi Arabia was used as a front because it&#39;s citizens have a reputation for not overstaying visas and spending a lot of cash. What you seem to not understand is some countries have no database and limited capabilities to verify its citizens. </p>

<p>Given that information, we haven&#39;t even had a major attack from ANYONE from any of the countries listed in the travel ban. How does that possibly make any sense to you other than the fact you can&#39;t admit the man you voted for into office is a buffoon?</p>

<p>The hijackers came through SA to avoid detection BECAUSE the USA would have stopped them from coming from countries that were suspected of harboring terrorists. That alone shows the need for improve vetting.</p>

<p>You don&#39;t have to &quot;buy&quot; it. A candidate for POTUS doesn&#39;t have the same access to who wants to harm our country as the POTUS. Do you think he doesn&#39;t now know 30% of the FBI caseload is spent on refugees who might be terrorists? Of course he didn&#39;t know then what countries can and cannot identify its citizens. The briefings allowed him to identify specifics.   </p>

<p>ISIS has been drowning people in cages, killing people with chainsaws, raping and making slaves out of its captors, slitting throats, burning people and blowing things up. If any of these battle hardened loonies gets put in our midst we will suffer greatly. </p>

<p>Honestly if you want my true opinion, Trump is obviously just a puppet. Every president has been and always will be. There&#39;s an agenda that&#39;s so far beyond our knowledge they are about 20 steps ahead of you and I. There is a war, but it ain&#39;t ISIS. It&#39;s war against billionaires.</p>

<p>What you and I are arguing is surface level shit that the bulk of the population already debates. Hell, it&#39;s what they WANT us to debate.</p>

<p>You&#39;re right I was wrong. Trump isn&#39;t just any old puppet, he&#39;s the first president I&#39;ve seen to be Kremlin&#39;s puppet. Such a change that he&#39;s started a civil war in our own intelligence community.</p>

<p>It&#39;s so amusing to me hearing a Trump supporter say that I haven&#39;t done my research. I mean I needed that laugh, thank you.</p>

<p>Let me ask you, did you come to <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> before or after Hillary&#39;s emails?

<p>I don&#39;t listen to what she said. I listen to the investigations performed by various intelligence agencies confirming the same thing that Russia was behind hacking our servers to find out about her emails. It seems all too suspicious Trump will not under any circumstances release his tax returns, has praised Putin, and has multiple staff members lie under oath about involvement with Russia. There&#39;s just too much evidence to NOT believe something is going on.</p>

<p>Let me ask you this, if you believe the world trade centers were brought down by controlled demolitions, then you believe the government has such as strong power with propaganda that they could get away with murdering over 3,000 of their own citizens.</p>

<p>If they can do THAT, how on Earth do you trust a man like Trump?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>First you&#39;re making a really broad statement about climate change. Don&#39;t conflate climate change and man-made climate change. The Earth warms and cools over cycles of time and this is a FACT. The WAR ON climate change is based on looking at a short span of time... and 97% of scientists agreeing on man-made climate change is a lie. Refute the facts in these videos if you disagree.</p>

<p>The next facts you&#39;re ignoring are that refugees increase crime. The refugee crisis was manufactured in the first place by a US-lead regime change in Syria... There are innocent refugees of course, but terrorism has increased in Europe as a direct result of this. Just yesterday CNN cut the feed when the facts were presented.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Wow I didn&#39;t actually think there would be a climate change debate in here. I guess I am in <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>.</p>

<p>Everyone knows the Earth warms and cools over a long period of time. No one is debating that. The reason man-made climate change is so important is because we&#39;re increasing the warming of the planet and an unprecedented rate. We&#39;re altering the natural cycle of the Earth&#39;s warming and cooling.</p>

<p>If you take politics out of it and just look at the facts, it really isn&#39;t hard to see that it&#39;s clearly happening and is threatening our very existence. The facts are that carbon dioxide warms the planet and we have been producing an insane of amount of it since the industrial revolution. It really isn&#39;t that hard to understand.</p>

<p>Our oceans are soaking up carbon dioxide and turning it into carbonic acid which in turn is killing ocean life. Over 80% of our coral reefs have depleted in just 20 years. Just think about that. </p>

<p>Anyway this really isn&#39;t a debate anymore. The 97% of scientists you say don&#39;t believe in man made climate change is reversed, buddy. And the 3% who don&#39;t believe in it have been paid off to make those claims.</p>

<p>I&#39;m at work so I can&#39;t view your videos, but I&#39;ll give them a chance when I get home.</p>

<p>EM radiation caused from nuclear power and massive amounts of cellular and wireless networks is a much more likely culprit for global warming than CO2. These are the kind of arguments that are being suppressed.</p>

<p>We know that Obama lost Sarin gas in the middle east and left uranium irradiated weapons there as well. We know he bombed 5 of the 7 countries from the initial ban. This means that there are quite likely many millions of people in these countries who would like to have revenge on the US government by attacking its people. A temporary travel ban is therefore a sane and rational step for Trump to take.</p>
