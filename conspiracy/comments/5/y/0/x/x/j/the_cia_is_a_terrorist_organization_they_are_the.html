    <div class="md"><p>But if you&#39;ve ever been a part of a big organization, this is not a bad thing. Shit, you can make this metaphor all kinds of simple...</p>

<p>Imagine a computer, but every part of your computer could also perform independent computing functions. Yeah, that thing would compute like a motherfucker, but is it more efficient than a dedicated system? Does it make doing your taxes easier? </p>

<p>Every government organization <em>could</em> communicate better. But this comes with a set of increasingly unreachable expectations. Not only does the amount of email in your inbox go up a few exponents, but now you have to put standards in place for using information. Then you need liability for when someone misses a communication and manufactures a plane that crashes. </p>

<p>Then you get geniuses who, if you tell them enough, will start to think they know better. 100% of upper managers are like this.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>9/11 and other false flags showed that even the FBI,  Secret Service,  anyone,  from inside the US or from outside,  was capable of being used to operate a plan.   I am saying that the place from which 9/11 was operated would be very hard to phantom.    I suspect Cheney knew parts,  but not all.    I suspect Giuliani knew parts but not all.   Who knew all?   Probably no one!    </p>

<p>Listening to former CIA or former FBI people,  its obvious how brainwashed they have been into particular elements that are distractions.</p>

<p>Or military.    For example,  the amount of time they have spent getting familiar with the details of sectarian factions in Iraq,  Syria,  Iran,  Turkey, Libya etc. even reading the Koran and being expert on &quot;Islamic Fundamentalism&quot;  as if that explained the false flags,  or that explained the fall of regimes in Iraq,  Libya,  or the war in Syria!!!!!    Or explained Ukraine.

<p>&quot;Need to know&quot; keeps organization incompetence intentionally in place.   Those unfortunate enough to spend time in toxic institutions/organizations still have people at the very top who are not in the know,  following orders.</p>

<p>When it comes to private prisons,  the drug war,  pharmaceutical corporations,   the deciders are not to be found in government posts,  in my opinion.    Or 9/11,  it was dreamed up by a think tank   <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_for_the_New_American_Century">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_for_the_New_American_Century</a>
and you can be sure that the same MIC that Eisenhower warned about,  corporations like Halliburton,  were the sponsors of that think tank.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The deep state consists of unelected intelligence officials, heads of multinational corporations, private security firms, and powerful current/former politicians(neocons/neolibs). The existence of the deep state isn&#39;t even really that much of secret. Read about the CFR, Trilateral commission, and Project for A New American Century. There are plenty of other think tanks and secret societies that these &quot;elites&quot; participate in. It is really all public knowledge. Hidden in plain sight. </p>

<p>There are many possible reasons that this leak got out. A common theory is that there is a civil war going on in the intelligence community. The NSA and CIA are at odds. There are agents/officials in the FBI, CIA, and NSA that want to disrupt the status quo and are fighting for the common good. This may be one of those agents/officials leaking this.</p>

<p>This could also be a planned leak by the CIA to scare any possible revolutionaries. They are threatening us. We are always being surveiled by the secret police. If we  act out of line, we could be killed in a plane or car crash and no one would notice any foul play. This will just become the new normal.</p>

<p>This is a conspiracy sub, so the big deal is whether or not they intend to terrorize. A bold claim to even suggest CIA has any such intentions. Saying that the government itself intends to terrorize, that&#39;s too absurd. I&#39;m sure most people here would agree.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>As an outsider who has studied and lived in the US for 3 years, I love American people. I&#39;ve made friends and generally everyone was helpful but and there&#39;s a big BUT I absolutely hate American government. It is corrupt and they terrorise the whole world. Mind you there corrupt government everywhere but nobody as powerful as US and if they terrorise its local. </p>

<p>Having said that, I can acknowledge that there maybe good people in the government but they do not have power to do anything. The terrorists own US government - Vietnam, Afghanistan, Iraq, Libya, Syria, most of Southern America, the poor island in the Pacific (forgot the name) which was a nuclear test site for almost 20 years! 20 years of Hiroshima bombs - imagine what the people went through. Do you still think CIA has good intentions? They&#39;ve probably killed billions by now.</p>

<p>At the federal level. Add in the debt at the state, county, and local levels and it&#39;s much higher.</p>

<p>And that doesn&#39;t even cover the long-term stuff. That&#39;s just the debt already accrued.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Okay then. 3 questions.</p>

<p>1) Why was there 28 reported deaths, and not a single name released? also, why were the families not aloud to see the childrens bodies?</p>

<p>2) Where is the footage of Adam Lanza breaking the window, walking around the halls, or shooting anyone? The school had brand new surveillance systems installed at the start of that year. Also, where is the footage of them bringing out victims? </p>

<p>3) Why were facebook pages and tweets commemorating the shooting made up to 1 month in advance?</p>

<p>4) Why did reports say there was only 4 handguns found at the scene and that an AR was in Lanzas trunk, but the medical examiners said they were all shot with a bushmaster AR-15 and that he had many high capacity clips with him?</p>

<p>5)Why was there well known crisis actors giving interviews as parents?</p>

<p>6)Why was the crime scene destroyed?</p>

Im sure if he had a fourth daughter he&#39;d probably pimp her to mao to gain even more power, he&#39;s like the rosthchild of china</p>

<p>mao was an oppurtunists who hijicaked the soviet movement in china at that time, he started with like 10 foot soldiers and managed to seize power within the communist party and then ultimately beating chang&#39;s nationalists after ww2, pretty impressive tbh, but I dont think mao had anything to do with the CIA, his help came mainly from the KGB and the kremlin </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Retailers do not try to compete with Amazon as much as you think they would. Yesterday, I had to pick up a roll of labels for my label printer on short notice, so I couldn&#39;t order it online (<a href="https://www.amazon.com/DYMO-Extra-Large-Shipping-LabelWriter-1744907/dp/B001U729QK">$17 on Amazon</a>), So I went to Office Depot (Staples and Best Buy didn&#39;t carry the size I needed). Office Depot prices them at <a href="http://www.officedepot.com/a/products/356148/DYMO-White-LabelWriter-Shipping-Labels-4/">$33.49</a> online (was ~$37 in store). I tried to price match, but their policy doesn&#39;t allow Amazon marketplace items to be matched. I&#39;m pretty sure those labels aren&#39;t a marketplace item, and I pointed that out to them, but the employee seemed pretty set on their decision.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You equate low prices with some sort of freedom. This is a lie we&#39;ve been sold over and over. It&#39;s finally hitting critical mass. Amazon is selling those at prices that no one else could possibly afford. They sell them as loss leaders. They screw indie publishers into nonexistence. They do not respect or view literature or graphic novels as art. </p>

<p>Maybe just buy less crap you don&#39;t really need and you can justify spending $15 on a phone case. Because that&#39;s what it is actually supposed to cost.</p>

<p>Amazon treats employees at every level like crap. Uses intimidation tactics and threats. They dodge taxes in every host country. They are twisted stateless globalists. </p>

<p>When you buy local the money stays in the community. When you shop at Amazon you give your money to an evil stateless organization, that will reinvest every penny into making you miserable without ever realizing the true cause.</p>

<p>They spent millions on media manipulation, just so that you don&#39;t suspect the cause.</p>

<p>It feels good to get cheap stuff 2 days later, but there is nothing good about it. They are making billions off the backs of hard working American </p>

<p>Enjoy your cheap shit, but understand why I can never ever justify ever shopping on there again. Electronics should not be purchases so frequently that you can&#39;t afford to shop anywhere but Amazon. </p>

<p>People prefer to ignore and forget history, and should be remembered that a friendly face on the government doesn&#39;t and didn&#39;t fix the hidden and surreptitious ways some organizations do violating the human rights of nationals and foreigners. To be distracted by apparently progressive politics when the rotten core  perpetrates terrible crimes &quot;to defend&quot; that facade.

Read a post from The_Donald, scoff and laugh and remind ourselves &quot;how f-stupid do these people think we are&quot; then &quot;nah it&#39;s &quot;how stupid are these people&quot; and remind ourselves you&#39;re a small slither of idiots in an otherwise lovable place. To borrow from Star Wars &quot;who&#39;s more foolish? The fool or the foolS who follow him&quot; </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Maybe you should re-read the post. I know it&#39;s not The Donald, I was banned by them early on. I thought it was pretty clear my lil rant was quite anti-trump. And as for &quot;conflate with&quot; if anything I was conflating against. On that note I don&#39;t it believe it to be a conflation nor a long stretch to conclude some, if not all of my statement to be fact. Unfortunately only time will provide the back up to my statement. But, I do encourage you to have another bowl bruv. Might help iron out the reading ;)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Originally written in to the constitution to ensure you guys could defend your colony if the English returned or your own leadership decides to go rogue. But you have a lobby group making it impossible to even reduce how many rounds someone can spray from one clip by the smallest amount. That you want guns in schools. That children can own a gun but can&#39;t drink until your 21. That you can buy a gun from the back of a truck in a car park legally. That you don&#39;t wanna bother testing and back ground checking for potential nut bags buy a gun. Children finding guns and shooting their siblings. That your children aren&#39;t safe in school. That a man in florida shot another man in a theatre for throwing popcorn. that you have 30,000 gun deaths a year and that Chicargo felt the need to celebrate a week without a gun murder. That my american friend thinks it&#39;s great that no one &#39;messes&#39; with each other in bars etc cause you presume everyone is carrying...just to point out that this is not normal to the reat of the world. 
We only restricted our guns. You can own them. We just dont allow full auto assault rifles cause 1.there is NO sport in throwing a hundred rounds down range at an animal. 2. If you need a hundred rounds to kill what you&#39;re trying to get then you shouldn&#39;t have a gun! In other words there is only one reason for em, to kill people. 
Trust me I would love for it to be easier for me but I don&#39;t want it easy for a nutjob. we have a few, you guys???? 
We banned heavy weapons, licenced and background checked gun owners since 1996. We haven&#39;t had a massarce since and suicides rates by gun are 74% down. 
No one I knows worries about being shot when they go out (generally only criminals get shot here. and rarely). 
If we get into arguments, no one is fearful they&#39;ll be shot over the parking spot etc. 
As for the government, ours works for us and couldn&#39;t fully turn on us. We all vote! they have to keep everyone generally happy and our soldiers and police would refuse any action that would be outrageous or contradictory to our core. I live in a place that has been voted the most livable city in the world multiple times and people flock to my country and enjoy it&#39;s freedoms and safety...not bad for a place that gave up it&#39;s guns hey ;)
Everytime I&#39;m on Reddit, I not only see something about a shooting in the states but they&#39;re almost just for nutso reasons...I could link a few... 
So I ask, hows those guns working out for ya?
ps. they did pass a bill to be able to drone strike citizens at some point. just worth noting if you guys think you&#39;ll hold you leaders back. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Several points -- hear me out:::</p>

<h1>1. If CIA (and NSA) is in total control, is a terrorist organization, can manipulate cars blowing up, watch you from your Smart TV, where does that put your beloved President Trump for which all these &quot;awake&quot; Trump-fan boys adore? Is Trump anti CIA, NSA? The general he put up as NSA&#39;s head few weeks ago is a Trump loyalist seeded as head of NSA in order to destroy it from within? Is Trump part of the big plan and himself a terrorist?</h1>

<h1>2. Assuming the answer is a big &quot;NO&quot; from point one above, how in the world did an anti CIA, anti NSA guy leak thru to become president??? If the CIA is as smart, powerful, convincing, and down right nefarious -- being able to control your camera, TV, blow up your stupid Honda Civic with a remote control, and steal your children in the middle of the night, wouldn&#39;t one think they can control the election and actually get a candidate planted to their liking despite the electoral college and voting and all that hogwash? After all, they can control the computers people vote on, duh!</h1>

<h1>3. WikiLeaks: Lastly, it&#39;s quite funny how WikiLeaks -- a self proclaimed transparent institution that leaks files n secrets -- seems to ONLY focus on American leaks. It would be naive to think there aren&#39;t other corrupt countries and government spying. Have any of you ever lived in another country? Iran? Syria? Russia? Greece?I have lived in two of those four counties and if u think America is bad - go live in one of those countries and try to speak your mind. See if you last 6 months...</h1>

<p>It&#39;s quite funny that only American affairs and relations are &quot;leaked&quot; and then you conspiracy rabbit hole theorists jump the gun and call CIA a terrorist and such. There are kleptocracies all over the world (Russia, Greece, Saudi Arabia), totalitarian and/or brutal theocracy governments (Iran, Uzbekistan, Syria, Belarus) all over the world with spying, collusion, terror, and pedophilia 1,000x WORSE than what u have in the free United States of America.</p>

<p>Of course CIA has power. Of course they can view you from your Smart TV. Of course they can tap into your precious Facebook account. Of course they can blow up your friend&#39;s car. This isn&#39;t news. CIA / NSA can do a lot of things. They prob sitting back laughing at these leaks cause u barely scrapped 10% of the surface. We&#39;ve known what the CIA since its inception in 1947. And even then they existed years and years before! So none of this is news. What&#39;s scary is conspiracy theorist like Alex Jones (and Reddit) that post junk and Trump seemingly reads them and Tweets them as fact. But again... If y&#39;all correct, then Trump is either &quot;part of them&quot; cause there&#39;s no way an anti CIA can leak thru to be President -- or he&#39;s simply got something bad coming and should watch his back.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>For your first point, isn&#39;t it just as likely that they saw Trump as a useful idiot and rather than actively helping him just didn&#39;t try to stop him because they knew they&#39;d be able to control him?

<p>That is why pizzagate is so explosive, it ties the pedophile child-raping rings to the CIA&#39;s other activities. That is also why they call the CIA a family, it is very incestuous with all of that child rape going on as &quot;training.&quot; </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, but they need to stop portraying the bad guy as a &quot;villain&quot; because then people can&#39;t relate even when the villain gains some humanity. People rarely identify with the villain. They need to make a relatable character who thinks he or she id doing good, but then gains perspective that reveals their values/ actions as harmful instead. </p>

<p>&quot;Need to know&quot; keeps organization incompetence intentionally in place.   Those unfortunate enough to spend time in toxic institutions/organizations still have people at the very top who are not in the know,  following orders.</p>

<p>When it comes to private prisons,  the drug war,  pharmaceutical corporations,   the deciders are not to be found in government posts,  in my opinion.    Or 9/11,  it was dreamed up by a think tank   <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_for_the_New_American_Century">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_for_the_New_American_Century</a>
and you can be sure that the same MIC that Eisenhower warned about,  corporations like Halliburton,  were the sponsors of that think tank.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah. I mean I am not worried about them using it on me so much as I believe there should be oversight to  make sure the CIA isnt&#39; doing this stuff on our soil.</p>

<p>I also think it would be very naive to assume that if the CIA has this stuff then obviously Mossad, FSB, EIS, etc all probably have similar stuff. </p>

<p>I mean it indicates they were getting them from 0day &quot;dealers&quot; too, so they are also probably out in the wild. </p>
