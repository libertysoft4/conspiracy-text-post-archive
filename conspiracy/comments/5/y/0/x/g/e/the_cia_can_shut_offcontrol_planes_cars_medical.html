    <div class="md"><p>I posted this in another thread, but it seems appropriate here:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Boeing has a system called the &quot;Future Air Navigation System&quot;, or FANS. All 767 and later model 757 aircraft were fitted with this system. Part of the FANS system is a communications system that allows the airline or air traffic control to change the aircraft&#39;s navigational waypoints in flight.</p>

<p>Combined with an advanced Flight Management Computer System that is capable flying the aircraft from take off to landing by following programmed waypoints, the FANS system could turn a commercial airliner into a remote controlled drone.</p>

<p>To do it, all you need is the appropriate transmitter and the codes to access the aircraft&#39;s FMCS via FANS.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I first discovered this information in 2001, shortly after the attacks.</p>

<p>That article was published in 1998. You can be damned sure the CIA was interested.</p>

<p>The FANS data link can be used by ATC, the airline, or anyone with the right transmitter and codes.</p>

<p>AIRLINE OPERATIONAL CONTROL DATA LINK.</p>

<p>The AOC link gives airline data systems the ability to transmit new routes, position reports, and updated winds through the data link network.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I guess I&#39;ll bring up Malaysia Fight 370.</p>

<p>A few months after the disappearance, I remember reading a news article about how the Malaysian government had been officially investigating some kind of economic (Wall Street?) conspiracy. Details are a little fuzzy because it&#39;s the only time I saw it mentioned.</p>

<p>My theory is that the Malaysian government was onto something, and they were pressured to stop. When they continued, the attacks on their airlines were enacted as a means to get them to comply.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve searched for any mention of this investigation, but it looks like the internet&#39;s been scrubbed.</p>

<p>Anybody remember this or have any additional info?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That wasn&#39;t it. The Goldman investigation was about the FBI investigating a possibly criminal Malaysian fund - or something like that.</p>

<p>The one I remember is the Malaysian government itself investigating some kind of Western sector conspiracy.</p>
