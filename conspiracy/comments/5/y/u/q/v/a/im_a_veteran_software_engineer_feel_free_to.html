And to help the less technically savvy understand the contents of the latest WikiLeaks revelations.
I will answer all questions to the best of my ability. I have over 10 years experience in high level programming using a very wide range of languages and methodologies (C, C++, PHP, Perl, Python, x86  64  assembly, embedded..the list goes on)  I exclusively use Linux and ALWAYS compile my distros and router firmware from source (I don&#39;t trust anything unless I do it myself)</p>

<p>Edit: link the specific WikiLeaks document you have a question about. I won&#39;t speculate on future releases or anything non-technical related. My goal with this thread is to answer questions from a technical perspective of specific documents and/or goals and desired outcomes of programs outlined in Vault 7.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>What&#39;s in those tools? Specifically for mobile OS. Is it just for targeted attack and surveillance, or some mass surveillance and analysis of data?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Mobile OS, at least from this batch of documents, seem to target iPhone over Android.  Which, in itself, is strange given that the majority of phones on the planet are Android.  The conclusion drawn is that &quot;high level&quot; targets tend to use iPhone over Android.  The other curious factoid is that iOS has a much higher percentage of users in the US than abroad (in general).   And yes it seems to be targeted attacks they specialize in.   The NSA are experts at mass surveillance </p>

<blockquote>
<p>What kind of processes can be started remotely?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There are a mix malware/trojans/virus tools are intended to be either purely remote exploits and some that are purely physical access and data mining tools (an agent must gain physical access to a computer or server in order to infect and extract data)  and still some that are designed to be both.  The HUGE revelation with these exploits is that intelligence agencies (NSA,CIA,GCHQ) are discovering, purchasing, and borrowing/trading zero-day exploits (unknown to the manufacturer and therefore can&#39;t patch) without alerting the creator of the software that there are huge gaping security holes.  Instead, they are keeping them secret in order to perpetuate the use of their neat little hacking arsenal. In doing so, they further endanger the people of their own nation by leaving them exposed to these vulnerabilities.  Even more damning, is the claim by WikiLeaks that the entire hacking capability of the CIA has been compromised by the community at large.  Thereby further endangering ordinary citizens.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Can it be really done on shut down phone ?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I haven&#39;t seen any evidence of this in the WikiLeaks.  If another user has a document that outlines this I would encourage them to share it.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Can they plant illegal data and accuse later?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If they can gain remote control of a computer with sufficient privilege,  they can do whatever they want within the confines of the compromised device.  Including, but not limited to, planting evidence.  Although I should point out there is no mention of planting evidence, it is an implied fact of having administrative or sufficient user level access to a remote device.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My answer seemed to imply that Android is not really targeted.  That is not the case.  These documents specifically state that they have two separate &quot;sister&quot; branches. One that focus exclusively  on Android and one on iOS devices.  They can even compromise Solaris servers.  And hardly ANYONE outside major corporations and financial institutions uses that operating system.  By in large, the exploits target Windows and Mac from a user standpoint and Linux from a server standpoint (the majority or servers in the world run Linux)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes... and no.  Research the term &quot;air gapped&quot;.  It is safe to say, after the Snowden and Vault 7 revelations, that if your computer/server/network drive/removable device is connected to the internet (or connected to a device that is connected to the internet) the spy agencies can compromise it.  If they can&#39;t, they&#39;ll find a way (physically if need be).  They have the budget and means to do so.   There is also research and proof-of-concept that prove even air-gapped devices can be remotely compromised with some pretty wild (and quite brilliant) methods. </p>

The CIA hackers hang out there and interact with the community for the purpose of crowd sourced information.

Unless you take extreme caution not to cross-contaminate your Reddit user name with other accounts (Facebook, Google, Twitter etc)  The answer is yes. The NSA can find find out anything about your online activities in as much depth as they want. See: xkeyscore and Prism from the Snowden leaks. There&#39;s no evidence the CIA has that capability or collects that kind of data themselves. At least, not in Vault 7 part 1.  But they do have access to NSA data either directly or indirectly.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t have the time or energy to get in to the nitty gritty code of assemblers. Not really my expertise to be honest.   If you have the capacity to ask this question you realize what a massive headache assemblers can be. I remember in college having to create my own compiler for a language I created. I hated it.  I only mentioned compiling my own distros from source to point out that I like to make sure that I know exactly what&#39;s in my build. I am definitely guilty of relying on the open source community for security of compilers and the software I use in Linux. </p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>What compiler do you use and are you aware that the major ones introduce weaknesses?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Usually when people mention this, they&#39;re referring to compiler optimizations in the presence of constructs that depend on formally undefined behavior, such as aliasing violations or signed-integer overflow checks entailing signed-integer overflow.</p>

<p>This isn&#39;t the fault of compiler developers, who are the cream of the crop in software engineering and who possess a thorough understanding of the ISO standards; it&#39;s the fault of companies that allow people to code who shouldn&#39;t be coding. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Recently I heard John McAfee speak about security in relation to vault 7, and raised a point that with security systems we are focused on the endpoint.. Where spyware is caught as it enters your system, instead of catching a hacker or program from taking or implementing data before they bypass a firewall. Dealing with viruses malware etc, instead of just detecting unwanted traffic and blocking that port before they have a chance to find their way physically into your computer. He was speaking of a hardware device they are working on called &#39;Sentinel&#39;, which does precisely that.. catches rogue traffic in a Roku sized box, closes the port, blocks the traffic, and prevents unwanted transfers or snooping etc before they ever make their way to your computer.</p>

<p>My question is, is that the route to go at this point? Another piece of hardware to stand guard between our routers and our computers? And if you have heard of Sentinel, what is your take on it? It reminds me of the phone case Snowden designed to show when your data is being monitored.</p>

<p>One more question actually if that&#39;s ok, seeing how much of the world is ruled by code, and how much of our lives are surrendered online.. what would be the jobs people might want to obtain education for in the next few years based on current trends if they want to contribute to cyber security? What jobs do you see growing in the wake of things like vault 7 showing us the vulnerabilities of today&#39;s systems?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Forwarding a question:</p>

<p>Thought this was quite interesting, Seems Wikileaks may have forgot to censor an IP address on a screen shot, also the current username on the Windows machine.</p>

<p><a href="https://wikileaks.org/ciav7p1/cms/files/image2015-6-26%206:56:10.png">https://wikileaks.org/ciav7p1/cms/files/image2015-6-26%206:56:10.png</a></p>

<p>Here is what INTRIGUES me mostly. The IP he runs tracert on is from China</p>

<p>Lookup IP Address Location For IP: 220.231.37.144 Continent: Asia (AS) Country: China IP Location Find In China (CN) Capital: Beijing State: Beijing City Location: Beijing</p>

<p>reference for page <a href="https://wikileaks.org/ciav7p1/cms/page_18383036.html">https://wikileaks.org/ciav7p1/cms/page_18383036.html</a></p>

<p>Does CIA have a VPN in China to make it look like China is the source country of hacking attempts?</p>

<p>Take a look at the next screenshot of the tracert to the 220.231.37.145 IP address &#39; <a href="https://wikileaks.org/ciav7p1/cms/files/image2015-6-25%2013:51:59.png">https://wikileaks.org/ciav7p1/cms/files/image2015-6-25%2013:51:59.png</a></p>

<p>CIA may have a range of servers in the 220.231.37.XXX range take note as well of the number of hops it takes to reach the .145 IP address</p>

    <div class="md"><p>A friend of mine and myself were going through just the raw files uploaded to the Vault7 release and also found a few SSL certs one for Godaddy, BGHJ.NET, and another.</p>

<p>I personally believe these are part of a CNC (server to monitor infected clients, aka their targets) </p>

<p>Interesting enough they also uploaded a .reg file by accident as well. </p>

<p>Inside this reg file is a base64 encoded DLL file that is a method of infection.</p>

<p>Just started looking into it but it appears that the DLL sets up a scheduled task on windows to infect the PC, once infected it has another base64 encoded binary in the resources of a .net file that uploaded to notepad.cc with a targets information. Something that interests me is that notepad.cc is now no longer functional (personally never used the site from what I can tell it was a lot like pastebin) A lot of odd things going on here imo. Thanks for bumping my question up nichlatu.</p>
