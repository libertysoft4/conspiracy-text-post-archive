<blockquote>
<p>At about 6 p.m. on December 19, 2008, Connell was killed, at the age of 45,[1] in the crash of a single-engine 1997 Piper Saratoga private airplane, which he was flying, which occurred in Lake Township, between 2.5 and 3 miles short of the runway at the Akron-Canton Airport near Akron, Ohio. Connell was alone in the plane and had been returning from the College Park Airport in Maryland, near Washington, D.C..[8] The plane crashed on its final approach to the airport&#39;s main runway, between two houses, one of which was vacant. Connell had flown the plane from the Akron-Canton Airport to the College Park Airport on December 18, 2008 and, according to the Stark County, Ohio coroner, Connell had on his person a receipt for a breakfast he had purchased in Washington, D.C. on December 19, 2008.</p>

<p>On December 31, 2008 it was reported that air traffic controllers had noted prior to the crash that Connell was off course, that they had been in communication with him regarding this, and that he had been trying to get back on course at the time of the crash. There were reported to have been no signs of mechanical problems with the plane.[9]</p>

<p>The National Transportation Safety Board published its final report into the accident that killed Connell on January 28, 2010. The board concluded that Connell had lost control of the aircraft as a result of disorientation while turning in cloud. During a pre-flight briefing Connell had commented that he wanted to return to Akron before the weather &quot;went from bad to worse&quot;. Several other pilots in the vicinity had reported severe icing at the time of the crash; Connell&#39;s aircraft was not equipped or approved to fly in icing conditions.[10] <strong>A January 2010 article in Maxim Magazine speculated that because Connell possessed knowledge which, if revealed, would be damaging to high-level Republicans, his death may have been the result of sabotage of his aircraft,[11] particularly as his cell-phone was never recovered.[12] Project Censored, a small non-profit organization, has called for a Federal criminal investigation; and Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. has called the case &quot;more serious than Watergate.&quot;</strong> [13]</p>

<p>Or what about this, which was written by Cliff Arnebeck, Michael Connell&#39;s lawyer, aka <a href="http://www.edisonresearch.com/election-polling/">the guy who&#39;s working on the Edison Media Research / racketeering lawsuit</a> </p>

<blockquote>
<p>In our case that essential insider witness was Michael Connell, CEO of both New Media and GovTech, who was Karl Rove’s IT/Web guru for the full scope of his political operations before, during and after Rove’s tenure in the White House (2001-2007). I took Mike Connell’s deposition on the day before the 2008 Presidential election. He admitted that the placement of SmarTech in a control position over the 2004 Ohio Presidential election was a subcontract within his contract with the Ohio Secretary of State, but denied that he, Mike Connell, had put them there. On December 19, 2008, Mike Connell was assassinated according to an after-action report delivered to the Cleveland FBI by an informant deemed credible by Intelligence reporter and former NSA analyst Wayne Madsen.</p>

<p>...</p>

<p>According to Dana Jill Simpson whom we retained as a researcher in regard to the documented fraud in the 2016 Democratic primary: 1) <strong>in 2008, when Michael Connell was assassinated James Comey was Senior Vice President/General Counsel for Lockheed Martin, this nation&#39;s largest military contractor and the company into whose hanger Connell’s plane was taken after its crash</strong>; 2) in 2010 when we arranged service of a deposition subpoena upon Rove and the US Chamber, Comey was the Chairman of Board of Directors of the US Chamber of Commerce&#39;s National Chamber Litigation Center. In that position Mr. Comey played a key instrumental role in achieving the plainly unconstitutional, corrupt and corrupting decision by a five-four vote majority of the Supreme Court in Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission, No. 08-205, 558 U.S. 310 (2010) and the subsequent fraudulent appearance in the 2010 general election of the largest partisan shift of votes since the Depression and 3) in 2012 when we were involved, again with Ms. Simpson’s professional research assistance, in countering election racketeering activity, Mr. Comey was serving as counsel to Bridgewater Associates, the largest hedge fund in the world and possibly part of the cabal seeking to fraudulently orchestrate the 2012 presidential election in favor of fellow hedge fund executive and Republican Presidential candidate Mitt Romney.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>why do people always seem to get into tiny aircraft just before going public with x?</p>

<p>my advice: go public first!</p>

<p>also bad weather + small planes + inexperienced pilot is dangerous, dunno.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Nearly a year after Connell&#39;s death, someone sent <a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=0BwnI6PcRU44rWHFmSDM0WDB4bnM">a letter</a> to Connell&#39;s family, Arnebeck, the local FBI, and the NTSB claiming that Connell was assassinated. It contained an after-action report describing a convert operation to &quot;neutralize&quot; Connell, a &quot;NST&quot; (national security threat?), by installing a chip into his plane&#39;s static port system. The letter was sent under the name &quot;Mark Felt&quot; (the identity of &quot;Deep Throat&quot; from Watergate).</p>

<p>I&#39;m curious whether you think this letter was genuine or a hoax. Arnebeck believes it&#39;s credible, and apparently some intelligence experts do too, but others have considered it dubious. Connell&#39;s sister, who is a progressive and was suspicious about his death, also believes it.</p>

<p>The date of the letter (August 31, 2009) is interesting, since it came right at the end of August, as a scandal was unfolding about Blackwater and its role in the CIA&#39;s secret assassination program. So if genuine, this might be a sign that the Bush White House (which controlled the assassination program) and/or Blackwater had something to do with Connell&#39;s death.</p>
