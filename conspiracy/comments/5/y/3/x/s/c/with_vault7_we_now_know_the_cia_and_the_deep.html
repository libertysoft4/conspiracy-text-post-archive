    <div class="md"><p>American citizens on the whole will do nothing about this confirmed information. Most people will feel it doesn&#39;t affect their lives directly and will still continue just worrying about their life and the micro stresses and problems they face. This isn&#39;t a big enough thing to really get people mad. That&#39;s what is really sad. People simply aren&#39;t going to react much to this beyond the initial &quot;oh wow&quot; and then move on with business as usual. The system is designed to keep you so preoccupied with just keeping your head above water that there&#39;s hardly any energy or time to focus on justice. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you have them rooted and unlocked you have access to the core processes you can create a white list of what runs on your device, also on Windows make sure you prevent PowerShell scrips to run as administrator. Another layer is to have your router(or a RBPI)  sniff your network traffic, making sure you trace where every pakege is been sent to and alert you if any strange traffic happens. Basically you need to figure out what are the basic programs and script you need to run so that you can still navigate the interwebes... On the Samsung TV or any smart TV don&#39;t connect it to your internet special the china branded sets they probably sending data to China ( this goes for routers, web cams, and any Internet of things they come from there((not saying that Sony or American brands  are not doing the same). If you whant to be secure you need Linux and a good understanding on what runs and how it runs. If you have nothing to hide then fuck it they are not going to steal your I&#39;d . (They probably just want meta data to see what you are watching and determine if you would do somthing if they did something bad) </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Please you make it sound like Computers are this magical black boxes that nobody knows what runs on them. Programs are programs and they only work by running by a set of rules Zero Day flaws are holes on the rules or a different interpretinon of the rules that was not expected. If you own the box you can set the rules and the exploits they discuss are irelavent .... If you have a Windows environment you don&#39;t own the core , if there is a bug in the core where you can run processes with out the controlleres registering them, there is nothing you could do. But if you own the kernel and you know that only set number of programs run then if you have an extra you know you are compromised </p>

    <div class="md"><p>American citizen, non <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> subscriber here from <a href="/r/rising">/r/rising</a> because I&#39;m bored.</p>

<p>Yeah... I don&#39;t care and I&#39;m not going to do anything at this point. I&#39;m not shocked that the CIA builds intelligence-gathering capabilities. If it doesn&#39;t affect my life or concretely affect the future of the country, why <em>should</em> I care, really? More important political things to worry about, like income inequality, global warming, and geopolitics.</p>

<p>There&#39;s also the non-zero possibility that WikiLeaks has been completely co-opted or even was always a tool of state actors. I&#39;m not saying that I&#39;m <em>sure</em> Russia owns WikiLeaks, but I do find it suspicious that <em>all</em> of WikiLeaks&#39; content is targeted at Russian adversaries but never at Russia or her allies. Given that we know for certain that Russia is not a global paragon of individual liberty, that raises my eyebrows a tad.</p>

Soon enough some other scandal will break, we crazy conspiracy people will call it out for being what it is, a conspiracy, and we will be heckled endlessly by everyone calling us conspiritards, and then a month later a leak will happen that confirms that it was a conspiracy the whole time, and then the same masses that called us conspiritards will say they knew it was a conspiracy the whole time.</p>
