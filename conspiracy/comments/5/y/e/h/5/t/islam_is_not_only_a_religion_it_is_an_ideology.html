<p>&quot;Islam does not mean &#39;peace&#39;, it means &#39;submission&#39;... The Koran is full of &#39;jihad&#39; (religious war), the most talked about duty after &#39;tawhid&#39; (belief). Nothing else is mentioned more than the topic of fighting. ... this particular belief is more than just a religion. It&#39;s not just a spiritual belief. It is in fact, an ideology which you believe in, struggle for, and are willing to die for, because that is your whole life.&quot;- British Imam Anjem Choudary</p>

<p>&quot;Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah; and those with him are forceful against the disbelievers, merciful among themselves.&quot; -Qur&#39;an 48:29<br/>
&quot;Fight them until there is no (more) fitnah and (until) worship is (acknowledged to be) for Allah.&quot; (&quot;until religion is for Allah&quot; ie. unbelievers desist in their unbelief)- Qur&#39;an 2:193<br/>
&quot;And (also prohibited to you are all) married women <em>except</em> those your right hands possess. (&quot;The rape of married slaves (possessed persons) is permissible.&quot;)-Qur&#39;an 4:24<br/>
&quot;And when the sacred months have passed, then kill the polytheists wherever you find them and capture them and besiege them and sit in wait for them at every place of ambush. But if they should repent, establish prayer, and give zakah, let them (go) on their way. Indeed, Allah is Forgiving and Merciful.&quot; (&quot;Kill all non-Muslims if they do not convert to Islam and worship Allah.) -Qur&#39;an 9:5<br/>
&quot;O Prophet, fight against the disbelievers and the hypocrites and be harsh upon them. And their refuge is Hell, and wretched is the destination.&quot; (Dehumanizing those who reject Islam or a strict interpretation, by reminding Muslims that unbelievers are merely firewood for Hell. It also explains why today&#39;s devout Muslims have little regard for those who are either non-Muslilm or those that do not follow the holy book explicitly.) -Qur&#39;an 9:73<br/>
ISIS is not hijacking Islam, ISIS is practicing Islam in its purest form.</p>

<p>Islam condones slavery, as Muhammad himself was a slave trader...
&quot;A man decided that a slave of his would be manumitted after his death and later on he was in need of money, so the Prophet took the slave and said &#39;Who will buy this slave from me?&#39; Nu&#39;aim bin &#39;Abdullah bought him for such and such a price and the Prophet gave him the slave.&quot; Bukhari 34:351 Additional Koranic support for slavery: verses 33:50, 4:24, 8:69, 24:32, 2:178, 16:75</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Dear; I am a Turkish citizen over 30 and i do not find myself too religious at all. But i can easily tell you labeling people is the real enemy in our minds not the labels but the habit of labeling i mean. I read Quran a few times just to see if there are really some points or clues about aliens etc. The truth is Quran is book written for everybody to understand what is good and what is bad. Its simple as a context but not qualiy wise simple. Its effective emotionally if you seek of guidiance or a higher purpose for your existance.</p>

<p>I remember in university i was 22 or 23 and it was the first time i wondered what the book is actually about. I laid to my bed and started to read it. At some point i became very sentimental about the things it explains. And with my watery eyes i read a phrase as &quot; the ones who are crying while reading this; is from us&quot;... This was my most shocking experience with a religious book and i am sure its not a simple book at all.</p>

<p>It can be written by an alien mind or a real creator but i can assure you that its not really man made with its sincerety.</p>

<p>I do not feel myself as a right man about many things still. But i see the world is using religion as a tool to control masses and create conflicts. Praying and believing in a creator is totally a personel individual choice that noone has right to speak of.</p>

<p>If you see someone speaking of religion they are generally politician or some other dishonest being who wants to use it.</p>

<p>I just wanted to share my thoughts to enlighten you what Islam or Quran is actually not. Iran or other ıslamic countries or ISIS they are advertising the concept of Islam not according to the book and bending things for their own.</p>

<p>So please dont feel negative about the Quran itself but be wise agains the games who wants to play with it to have an advantage or a benefit.</p>

<p>Regards.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s just a lie, first off there is taqqiya in Islam which is commands to lie to non believers until you are powerful enough to defeat them. Second Isis follows the Quran more like Muhammad did. Don&#39;t try and lie with no true Scotsman fallacies. The Quran is full of violence, murder, rape and wife beating just to name a few.</p>

<p>The only semi correct thing you said is that the true problem isn&#39;t the Muslim (because they can give up Islam thus correcting their issue) it&#39;s the ideology they carry in their brain. A Muslim could become a secular humanist and become a good person.</p>

<p>It&#39;s just man made garbage mostly stolen and refactored by primitive savage Arabs from a dark age, maybe refactored by a guy Muhammad (maybe).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Your words include too much classifications; arabs muslims believers non-believers so on... These classifications are man made. To divide to create conflict. I am not a full supporter of Islam as i said i am not a religious man at all. Just wanted to tell your hatred is against a form of belief system that you have created in your mind; due to the negative marketing of islam because of bad examples of Iran Isıs and so on. You are forming the idea of something by looking at wrong examples. Listen politicians less and have some normal muslim friends to know better about the truth. Everybody is normal. Exluding these maniacs in ISIS. They should definitely not exist in a civilised world but i believe they are created to make people hate Islam. And i hate arabic words like Taqqiya you have mentioned because i am a secular Turkish man. I have no intention to lie someone i dont know and i just expressed my ideas. This also the all i can speak with somebody about religion. Thanks )</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Islam now, just like Catholicism/Christianity of the last 10 decades, has become a massive cultural threat to the Western World and I will fight til my last day against it. I have seen childhood friends become Muslims and become fucking Zombies who leave everything to submit themselves to some moon-god being and become fundamentalists.</p>

<p>Fortunately, The Christians/Catholics went through a reformation and people decided for the most part to see it as some relic of old, as all the Priests get busted for pedophilia and the Christian Pastors get busted for driving expensive cars.</p>

<p>But Islam is a whole other beast, especially since the liberal illogical left is calling on Islam (See Linda Sarsour) to lead the way into their spiraling Darkness.</p>

<p>There may be some decent things written in the Quran, but there is also some 3rd world Bullshit in there and this is where Islam belongs, in 3rd world unevolved countries that require tyrants to control the waring rapists/pedos who are within those countries.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I dunno &#39;bout that. I kinda follow your thinking, but &quot;any&quot; is a stretch. I&#39;m not religious, but I respect some ideologies that are lumped in with that box. For instance Buddhists and Taoists are considered by some of their ilk to be philosophies only, with no deities. Buddha himself said more than once he should not be worshiped as a god, or Bodhisattva, but many of his followers do so anyway. I actually like to study some religions. They can be interesting on several aspects, like morality, manners, art, motivation, etc.. I have no respect for I-slam.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thnx, Kitria, I did not know about this. After reading about it in AL JAZIRA, my interpret is this topic illustrates at least two principles. One, &quot;diversity is not our strength&quot;, &quot;the downside of diversity&quot; (look &#39;em up). Humans are by nature tribal, and religion is just one of many elements of &quot;otherness&quot; which can be seeds of hatred. Two, even Buddhists (whose religion sanctions peace) can show some cojones, and defend themselves against the &quot;other.&quot; It is a pity that some other means of separation could not be implemented. Our world needs a reshuffling of ethnic populations that results in pockets of homogeneity. Diverse communities, NO, a diverse world, YES.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thnx again K. I started to read a print copy a long time ago, but did not finish it. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AOXl0Ll_t9s">Here is a brief video summary.</a>  </p>

<p>I&#39;m persuaded of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muHg86Mys7I">Libertarianism,</a> which is a good &quot;ism&quot; all around, and opposed to the state, which Machiavelli showed how to support with immoral behaviors.</p>

<p>PS. Pol Pot was not defending his people, he was slaughtering them. I have studied Theravada Buddhism, and it is the most philosophical kind, my favorite of the various versions.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not bad. But that brief summary misses the larger point I was trying to make about how Machiavelli viewed religion as merely political utility and unsuited otherwise for the Prince himself.</p>

<p>Keep in mind how important religion was in the 1500s when this was written and to whom Machiavelli is specifically speaking (although, there is a case to be made that he was actually speaking to a different ruler and had to change the target due to his compromised position in politics). The idea you should be taking away from this is that using religion as a tool has been around from the beginning. Machiavelli simply put it in writing in order to give the rulers a chance to soothe their conscience.</p>

<p>Buddhism therefore, can also be used as can any other &quot;ism&quot; which draws together ideologues.</p>

<p>This explains how &quot;we will never forget&quot; is almost always forgotten and horrors repeated over and over. A holocaust becomes &quot;the holocaust&quot; not because of its singular horror but because people want to pretend that there was some unique ideology that allowed it to happen that could never happen again without adherence to a specific ideology.</p>

<p>It&#39;s simply not true and the evidence is in every corner of the world.</p>

<p>See what I mean?</p>

<p>The Prince is a short book.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oops, I see you&#39;ve added an edition to your comment and I&#39;d like to address that.</p>

<p>Regarding Pol Pot and Theravada Buddhism. Pol Pot&#39;s rule began as him &quot;defending his people&quot; from the outside invader - the French at first. And then restoring glory to &quot;his people&quot; which ended up being the Khmer Rouge at the expensive of all those pansy assed Buddhists. </p>

<p>But if you studied Theravada Buddhism in comparison to other Buddhist sects and other religions, you will have noticed that Theravada Buddhism is the sect that is most strict in ritual and form. And in Cambodia, that form and ritual is still critically important in culture. It made a very easy transition point for Pol Pot.</p>

<p>Another interesting book you might enjoy <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Pol-Pot-Nightmare-Philip-Short/dp/0805080066">Pol Pot: Anatomy of a Nightmare, Philip Short</a>. It&#39;s not in the public domain so here is a synopsis to help you decide if it&#39;s interesting enough to split the bucks:

<p>As for your comment/video about Libertarianism, I will respond separately.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>When I read about Theravada Buddhism in the 1960s, also <em>Siddhartha</em> by Herman Hesse, the parts I remember: the 4 Noble Truths, the 8 Fold Path, and some Jataka Tales. Mahayana Buddhism, was too jazzed up with Bodhisattvas, fancy temples, and veneration of the Buddha as an object of worship rather than a teacher of the Way. Zen is called Buddhism, but if you look into it, there is not much in common with the north India tradition like you see in Asoka, so I don&#39;t know why it claims so. Tibetan Buddhism is a bit of a mystery to me because it is so into a special kind of meditation, but I like the chants they do for hours, Om Mani Padme Hum.</p>

<p>Because you make good points, no argument. </p>

<p>My philosophy goes beyond Libertarianism, to which I&#39;ve added &quot;Let it Be&quot;... can be interpreted: we go parallel paths; but if an intersection occurs, and the crossing is harmless, we nod acceptance of the other&#39;s attitude and the mutual differences at the same time. There may be threads upon which we agree.</p>

<p>But there are elements of society who have dangerous paths, and I am doing a small service to the public to help make these dangers known. If you read my issues and agree, good for you. If you read something of my issues and disagree, I ask that you pass me by, and do no harm (please don&#39;t slam the door on your way out).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh, I can help. The main difference between Tibetan Buddhism and other forms of Buddhism, is the color of their robes. </p>

<p>Of course, I jest but only to make a point. Note that when you google Buddhist monks, you get a sea of orange (or rather, saffron), and bald heads because they want to look as much alike as possible. It is the entire point really - the de-emphasis of self.</p>

<p>Which, I&#39;d like to point out is the entire point. It is the polar opposite of Libertarianism.</p>

<p>Either way, they are both &quot;isms&quot; which only serve to tell others that you belong somewhere.</p>

<p>Silly, really.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So about Libertarin-ism. ;-)</p>

<p>Let me start by explaining why I keep harping on that ism stuff.</p>

<p>When you&#39;re using that suffix in this manner (as opposed to making an action noun), you&#39;re denoting a practice of philosophy. Agree?</p>

<p>There is nothing inherently wrong with practices and philosophies, in fact, they make us who we are. </p>

<p>But as soon as you start making declarations about your subscription to a particular ism, your brain does a funny thing. </p>

<p>&quot;Ah, at last, I&#39;ve landed at my destination and can put this question to rest.&quot;</p>

<p>Agree?</p>

<p>And so, if I were feeling particularly Machiavellian, I could have told you, (after having briefly studied your post history), that I am a Libertarian too.</p>

<p>In point of fact, I do qualify as a Libertarian in the purest definition of the word.</p>

<p>And your brain would instantly do what brains do  - it would begin to assign categories and make assumptions. You can&#39;t help it. It is a valuable defense mechanism that has enabled us to evolve to where we exist now.</p>

<p>Agree?</p>

<p>That person lives in my neighborhood, goes to my church, drives the same kind of car, listens to the same music, likes the same food, etc... you will tend to gravitate toward that person without knowing anything about their behavior. Usually it works.</p>

<p>But the &quot;isms&quot; tell your brain that this person actually thinks the way you do and that trumps all kinds of other things that may influence how you behave toward them.</p>

<p>And here we are, two people who know very little about one another yet we may believe that we have something in common because we both value liberty and self ownership. Would you agree?</p>
