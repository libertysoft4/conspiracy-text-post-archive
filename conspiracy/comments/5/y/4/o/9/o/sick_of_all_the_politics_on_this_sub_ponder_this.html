        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>MH370 and Malaysia air 17 were both beoing 777-200EER aircraft. Both aircraft have transponders that could be turned off by techniques and technology shown to be available to the CIA in the vault seven release. Not only turned off but flown remotely. (So can 747&#39;s btw) Russian investigators at the site of the Malaysia air wreckage noted it was strange how many south asian bodies were among the wreckage and the strong odor of formeldehyde. </p>

<p>In a blog post, Malaysia&#39;s former prime minister, Mahathir Mohamad, wrote that he believes the US Central Intelligence Agency must know something about the plane&#39;s fate. He also claimed that Boeing, the plane’s maker, and “certain” unnamed government agencies, are able to take control of commercial airliners such as the missing Boeing 777 remotely if necessary. &quot;Airplanes don’t just disappear,&quot; he wrote on his blog. &quot;Certainly not these days with all the powerful communication systems, radio and satellite tracking and filmless cameras which operate almost indefinitely and possess huge storage capacities. ... For some reason, the media will not print anything that involves Boeing or the CIA.&quot;</p>

<p>this link takes a theory in a different direction but has some very interesting additional information about how this type of plane works along with detailed flight path info <a href="http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2015/02/jeff-wise-mh370-theory.html">http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2015/02/jeff-wise-mh370-theory.html</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>I dont about that I do know I&#39;ve never even lost a frisbee on the frolf course. Welcome to r/conspiracy btw , commercial planes rarely disappear too many failsafes built into them to avoid such an occurance in this case they were intentionally deactivated. Multiple beacons both gps and radio based and the pinging sonar type.</p>

 Boeing planes (airliners) are ridiculous I grew up with an old 1940 fabric winged cessna and it even had 3 beacons in it. You can imagine how many an airliner has not to mention they are tracked by radar /radio wave / satellite and a last resort low tech sonar ping emitted from the black boxes in case of it going underwater. Not to mention the gsm or cdmsa signals on every cellphone on the plane in flight and the ability to triangulate radio signals . </p>

<p>Just found out CIA can fly planes by remote from vault 7. People who were at the scene were confused because bodies werent matching manifest and smelled like embalming fluid.</p>

<p>except the malayasian military later admitted they tracked the plane(mh370) on radar turning around and flying north through the straight of malaca before disappearing from radar at 2:14am in the morning</p>

<p>this post on a blog describes briefly the type of radar the malay (im tired of trying to spell it) military uses/used at the time <a href="https://www.quora.com/What-type-of-military-radar-is-used-by-the-Malaysian-military">https://www.quora.com/What-type-of-military-radar-is-used-by-the-Malaysian-military</a> I have no idea of the range of this radar but I am gonna make an educated guess that since it can be used to guide missiles it is at least a couple hundred miles which if the plane kept heading on its path at the time would have put it over land making debris floating across the hard solid ground of india/bangladesh/ nepal/butan then into the indian ocean and then all the way to the coast of africa to be found by tourists on a beach years later. Doesnt quite stack up.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>At first I was feeling a bit unsure about vault 7&#39;s release and leaning towards the idea that Wiki could&#39;ve been compromised but check this out. Maybe I&#39;m reading way too much into this but:</p>

<p>• The release of vault 7 directly correlates with the 3 year anniversary of the disappearance of mh370 ( March 8, 2014) which was bound to get a lot of MSM and stir up a lot of interest and attention from people.</p>

<p>March 7th= 3/7 (vault 7 release)
3 year anniversary/ vault 7= 37
Flight #= mh370</p>

<p>we were given multiple clues to piece together what could be released. I myself was a bit underwhelmed BUT this leak had everything to do with being able to compromise technology.</p>

<p>the Freescale/Rothschild patent theory that has been debunked/reopened/repeat is back to being under the microscope and pretty much confirmed by the leak </p>

<p>•RUSSIA &amp; MH17</p>

<p>All the talk about Russia, wiretapping, hacking, compromising software mixed with the attention of the mh370 anniversary and Vault 7 is going to push people to look into mh17 I remember instantly thinking MH370 was mh17.</p>

<p>the most memorable of the entire event were the remarks regarding the bodies from Igor girkin, the leader of the the pro Russian Rebels who ran the recovery.</p>

<p>According to girkin the site had a horrendous odor of embalming fluid and decaying bodies all lay in a sunflower field some still strapped to their chairs with phones in hand. While other bodies are ejected from the aircraft landing on people&#39;s roofs and in their backyards. Mostly interested in the idea of the decaying bodies if the plane exploded in air wouldn&#39;t the bodies smell like they were burning? </p>

<p>He claims the bodies were deceased and drained of blood prior to being boarded to the plane and there were medications and fluids given to achieve that also on the site. 
The entire removal process was disgusting and vile like they had no idea how to handle the damage they did.</p>

<p>*side note, there is now a new theory 
That North Korea stole mh370 (need more info on this)</p>

<p>With that being said and I know this is a long post and maybe I&#39;m looking way too far into this but what if Russia was just the scapegoat for mh17?</p>

<p>By taking mh370 off the radar, giving it a paint job and new flight numbers while we were distracted desperately searching for wreckage, answers, and victims while they&#39;re being preserved. </p>

<p>Then Mh17 takes off being remotely flown over a war zone with the intent It gets shot down by pro Russian rebels. The actual victims of the explosion are mostly thrown all over (roof comment) and scattered body parts (like they found in the field)  In order to make it look more legit they bring the preserved victims of mh370 to the open field for shock value and to hide any further question of someone actually finding any sort of evidence that mh370 was really mh17.</p>

<p>^ that&#39;s just my theory, would love to know if anybody thinks something along those lines happened </p>
