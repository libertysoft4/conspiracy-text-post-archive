    <div class="md"><p>im looking into it as it has me curious too. So far i find that the car was going 190 kmph through a narrow tunnel and collided with a post of some sort. 190 is fucking FAST. The car was a rental from the hotel she was staying in. I&#39;ll try and find more about this car. It is a Mercedes s280</p>
