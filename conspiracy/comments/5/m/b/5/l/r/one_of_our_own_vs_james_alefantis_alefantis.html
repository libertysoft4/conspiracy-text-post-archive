        <p><span class="badge badge-primary">345</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;2017-01-06 by <a class="author" href="../../../../../../../../user/LightBringerFlex.html">LightBringerFlex</a></p>
        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Ok, so this guy found out that the kill room is in Pegasus Museum. See his deleted but re-uploaded video below:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQgW9qvOiik">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQgW9qvOiik</a></p>

<p>This guy sells pizzagate T-shirts and is a soldier on the front lines fighting the good fight. Anyway, he tries to pull an interview with Alefantis and gives it a shot by messaging him on instant messenger through Facebook I believe. Alefantis goes bananas and tell hims to call within 10 seconds. The guy freaks and calls. Alefantis then threatens to kill the mans whole family and instant messages family photos of his mom and girlfriend. He mentions that the main part he wants gone is the Pegasus museum part. Alefantis is on full blown threat mode and so the guy takes it down but then he makes another video of Alefantis threatening him:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZQxYQ49p0U">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZQxYQ49p0U</a></p>

<p>Why does Alefantis have access to this guys full name and why does he have pictures of this mans family? It is because he is connected to the spy system through agencies like the NSA. </p>

<p>Alefantis is really pissed about the Pegasus Museum being exposed as the location for the kill room where they kill the kids after raping them. This, obviously, can attract a ton of attention to that museum and Alefantis doesn&#39;t want this. </p>

<p>I am assuming there is more that he is hiding than just the kill room. Anyone have any ideas as to what that might be? Maybe a Satanic ritual room?</p>

<p>Edit:</p>

<p>Kill room is in Pegasus museum which is in an alley and surrounded by buildings. There is graffiti on a brick that says &quot;kids&quot; with arrows pointing down (underground tunnel?). There was a man on the roof too (maybe spotter?). </p>

<p>Edit 2: word is people are heading out to the museum tomorrow to look around a bit. </p>

<p>Edit 3: </p>

<p>More proof this is real. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That is the point he was making with the text: &quot;FBI liked your video&quot;...he is (or is pretending to be) in contact with FBI. </p>

<p>He is freaking out though. If he really has any power, he doesn&#39;t have a blowout on he phone.</p>

<p>Emoji at the end looks like he is saying comet ping pong is a prostitution place. </p>

<p>If there is a city in the US where something like this could happen, it is Washington D.C.</p>

<p>Finally, top 50 most influential people? He talks like an operator...like he owns the world.  But he is just a jagoff running a good cop bad cop, algorithm (where he is both cops--instant anger, instant forgiveness upon cooperation,  but you owe me...constant intimidation, etc.).</p>

<p>And waves? There is a tsunami heading in his direction if it&#39;s all true: have we asked ourselves why the video is suddenly back up and our plucky profiteer is back in business? Is there not a possibility some guardian angel who is perhaps higher up than GQ&#39;s top 50 put his hand on his shoulder and said, &quot;carry on my son&quot;? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t know what to think of the conversation video. Part of me thinks it&#39;s phony. He didn&#39;t record the second call when he had the chance to, and if he was really afraid he wouldn&#39;t have posted this video in the first place. Also, wouldn&#39;t Alefantis have been at least slightly concerned about being recorded before making numerous threats? If that audio had gotten out on YouTube it could have been very incriminating. </p>

I&#39;m all for transparancy, and taking the high road while investigating, but this was blatantly sloppy and handled unbelievably poorly. What the fuck did that guy expect to happen? &quot;Oh no, you&#39;ve caught me, I&#39;ll admit everything.&quot; </p>

<p>Let&#39;s play devils advocate for a moment. You&#39;re James Alefantis, and maybe you&#39;re starting to get a little nervous about all this people digging into your shit. Lo and behold some fucking gung-ho idiot shows his hand by bringing up the Pegasus museum and now you&#39;re sweating. But wait, this moron decided to attack your from his Facebook full of PII (personally identifiable information) so you fire back at him with whatever you can to shake him off the trail. </p>

<p>Tl;dr - Calling out Alefantis/ANYONE with all your shit visible to the public is asking for him/whoever to personally attack you.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>To me it looks like alefsntis spotted how naive the guy was and figured a good threat would scare him off like it has in the past assuming alefsntis has done this often in his line of business. The OP, being naive, obeyed but then uploaded a 2nd YouTube video talking about the threat without considering alefsntis would literally shit a container of bricks if he saw it. He is a bit naive but that doesn&#39;t make him a bad guy. </p>

<p>If this is real, OP hit a nerve with alefsntis. Luckily a few locals are heading down for a tour of the museum tomorrow I hear. Guess we&#39;ll find out. </p>

<p>If something goes wrong, well, his life may be the compensation that was sought for. You really can&#39;t escape this. People used to readily put their life on the line for freedom and you shouldn&#39;t denounce that.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>After some consideration, I think what you did was good move. I read your comment about Alefantus being very flagrant and open about what he did in secret and agree with you that maybe this was a great move to draw him out. Honestly now, this guy was a fucking dumbass to keep all of his stuff up on public social media, and has been the Achilles (lol) heel of Pizzagate and it&#39;s investigation.</p>

<p>I apologize  for initially thinking your move was stupid (though it is a controlled risk considering your family/friends) but if it works and parallels the actions of Alefantis than it who am I to criticize it.</p>

He didn&#39;t record the second call when he had the chance to, and if he was really afraid he wouldn&#39;t have posted this video in the first place. Also, wouldn&#39;t Alefantis have been at least slightly concerned about being recorded before making numerous threats? If that audio had gotten out on YouTube it could have been very incriminating if the conversation happened as he described it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ryan is making a claim that could be libel, and sued in court if he&#39;s lying. Selling shirts is a bit on the questionable side, maybe. But how much do you think he&#39;d make selling 100 shirts? Ever tried to sell shirts online, it&#39;s near impossible. It&#39;s not a get rich quick scheme, or make a bunch of money quick scheme. Nothing wrong with questioning his evidence of the threats, but I don&#39;t see the selling of shirts as a reason to immediately discredit his intentions.</p>

<p>I get the disdain for people trying to profit from the investigation. But how is it any different than Reality Calls or David Seaman (arguably some of the best faces for Pizzagate). They literally ask for donations. If you give 20 bucks to either of them for a donation, they get all of it. If you give 20 bucks for a shirt, he might get 3 or 4 bucks. I don&#39;t get the separation, in fact, it seems quite a bit less profitable to sell shirts than to directly ask for donations.</p>

<p>Why does Alefantis have access to this guys full name and why does he have pictures of this mans family? It is because he is connected to the spy system through agencies like the NSA.</p>

<p>It could be any one of the intelligence agencies. NSA does more passive types of surveillance, and they&#39;re looking more for insurrectionists. If it came from electronic sources, it&#39;s probably them.</p>

<p>If it came from active surveillance, that tends to be more FBI, occasionally CIA, or other, smaller agencies.</p>

<p>But I&#39;m not convinced of that, so I wouldn&#39;t recommend such a course of action.

Also just simply to get back at Alefantis for threatening to sue him, by making it seem that the real infractor during the call was Alefantis, for threatening him with death, and not himself for querying about Pegasus and about P*zzagate in general?</p>

<p>Body armor next to the bed is the ultimate half measure.</p>

<p>Not at all. And the fact that you&#39;re saying things like this makes it really obvious that you&#39;re ignorant about the subject area.</p>

<p>Next time you talk to a cop, ask them if they have a gun next to their bed.</p>
