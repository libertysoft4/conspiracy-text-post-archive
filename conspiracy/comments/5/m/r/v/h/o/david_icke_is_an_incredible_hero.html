    <div class="md"><p>You don&#39;t know where he puts his money. Just because he shows a modest flat doesn&#39;t mean he doesn&#39;t have accumulated wealth. David Icke sells books, and half of what he spews out you need to be on acid to visualize what he is saying. Him and Alex Jones are from the same womb. When Ickes was asked by one of his followers &quot;Do we live on a Flat Earth?&quot;, he didn&#39;t give a direct &quot;yes&quot;, or &quot;no&quot; answer. Instead, his reply was &quot;What difference does it make?&quot; (we&#39;ve heard that line before). Yet, he somehow knows in full detail the description of a planet 150 light years away that the white striped, shape-shifting lizards live on. The guy is a bullshit artist.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Justin Bieber fills arenas... having a following doesn&#39;t mean somebody is right.  Icke went on TV and declared himself the second coming of Jesus Christ and was rightfully laughed off the stage.  He then reconsidered his approach and dropped the &quot;I&#39;m Jesus&quot; routine and came out with his reptilian theory.  That got a following but also got laughed at by a lot of people so now he started shedding the reptilian talk and tries to play it off like he was speaking metaphorically.

    <div class="md"><p>He didn&#39;t say he was the son of god as is everyone else.  His excuse for saying he was Jesus Christ return is he said at the time he was having all sorts of information revealed to him and he didn&#39;t understand where it was coming from so he actually thought maybe it was coming directly from God and he was the second coming.  That is the explanation he gave for saying that.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>All humans have a &quot;victimization mentality&quot;. That is why we are currently enslaved. It is a belief system ingrained in the Conscious and Deep Subconscious Minds.

    <div class="md"><p>To be honest: his words where over my head, yours don&#39;t but I&#39;m not entierly sure you two speak of the same thing.
You speak of &quot;victim mentality&quot; which is a very real thing indeed, but shreding ones vicim mentality does not in any way hinder one from becoming a victim which is what he claimed.</p>

<p>I mean you can shred your victim mentality all you want but if ie somebody robs you you are a victim regardless and on a higher plane you are stil a victim for these predators in this system even if you&#39;ve stoped seeing your self as a victim.
I hope you get the gist of what I&#39;m trying to communicate.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>correct. but the removal of that belief system from both the conscious and subconscious minds eliminates the magnetic connection. the person is now vibrating on a completely different level. there is no magnetic cohesion between the two parties. therefore situations will arise that will repel the predator from the energy field of the changed individual.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You are welcome friend.  I copied it from my original post a few days ago.  I wonder how long people like David Icke, Former CIA and FBI Whistleblowers, and others would last if they spoke 100% truth all the time.  Not very long is my guess. As he says in his own books he was told to leave the Reptilian stuff out of it but thinks people are adult enough that they can make up their own opinions so he kept it in.  Like with any information, we can disseminate ourselves what we are prepared to believe in at a certain point in time.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hi. It is unfortunate these people cannot actually read the book or watch the lecture and then pick and choose what material resonates with them. Since they cannot comprehend the Reptilian Theory, they throw everything out and label him &quot;insane&quot;. In a 10 hour lecture there is an enormous amount of material covered on a variety of subjects. I consider it a benefit to hear everything and then make decisions from that point. That being said; every year more and more of David Icke&#39;s material is being seen as actually true..</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree.  10 hours is a hell of a lot of time to spend listening to anyone talk no matter how interested a person is in the material.
Even things I believe to be true in many different scandals, I still catch myself thinking &quot;really can this actually be true?&quot;, the Franklin Scandal being one of them.  Then look at the Epstein court documents and see a very similar theme of the FBI having 34 confirmed underage victims and what was said was &quot;Overwhelming evidence&quot;, yet they let him plead to lesser state charges behind the backs of the victims.  Sam with Hastert, he was paying over $3M to a former victim and they only charged him with the crime of deliberately withdrawing small amounts less than $10,000 to avoid the withdrawals being flagged, after they caught him making bigger payments.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>David Icke was laughed at and spit on for years after saying numerous figures in British Politics and Entertainment were in fact brutal pedophiles. We now see this to be true and expanding in scope every day. Many of the people who now clearly see the horrors of pizzagate, are the same people who 6 months ago would ridicule and insult others for a Hypothesis that some American Political figures are pedos and possibly full fledged Satanists..</p>

    <div class="md"><p>While I have reservations about Icke, I will always have some love and respect for him because he was one of the initial people that helped send me down this path. </p>

<p>The Biggest Secret was one of the first books I read about all this stuff and it was eye opening to me on many fronts (on historical, pedophile, monetary stuff etc.). I think he may be better served by not getting into the reptilain stuff but if that&#39;s his &#39;truth&#39; then may as well not hold back.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I am not necessarily against the idea of reptilian extraterrestrials playing a part in all of this or a staunch disbeliever. I have heavily researched what people have had to say about it and try to keep an open mind, I just feel that I don&#39;t have concrete enough evidence to believe in it yet.</p>

<p>Me saying that I think he may be better served by not getting into the reptilian stuff was more about how it turns people off of opening themselves to other information that Icke presents. I tried to pass on The Biggest Secret to some of my friends after I read it and they immediately rejected the whole book before even getting too far into it because of his talk of reptilians. I&#39;m cool with it cause he isn&#39;t holding back and putting what he believes to be true out there but it prevents many people from getting into this stuff who otherwise possibly could/would.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What a brilliant post.  I feel the same way.  sometimes he will lose me with the arhons or whatever they are spelled, and delve into grand details of every aspect as if it&#39;s fact, then he names the reptilians his friends optomotrist studied at 4-6% of the population, then mentions how around 6% are psychopaths and he has me back on board.  I think he speaks in tongues on purpose to deliver a message to those aware.</p>

<p>The Reptilians are an example of inhuman, without morals or inhibitians by the time these people have reached the top nothing is left moral wise.  who else could drop 26,000 bombs this year, invade a country under false pretences of WMD.  Napalm parts of vietnam, drop atomic bombs etc.</p>

<p>it has to be those that are not normal humans.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>5/24 In the morning I woke up after sleeping only two hours and had coffee for breakfast. I had eggs, rice, beef burger, and the spinach/eggplany/cashews/celery mix for lunch. Took a test later and bombed it. Finished the night with rotisserie chicken, broccoli, and rice.</p>

<hr/>

<p>5/25 I had a chicken salad with two bananas for breakfast at work. Later on, I was very hungry and made the decision to not go to the gym and just make some food which was rotisserie chicken, eggs, and rice. Wasn&#39;t as filling as I thought it would be..</p>

<p>I made myself a banana smoothie with strawberries and had two cups before bed. </p>

<p>I didn&#39;t go to the gym both days and didn&#39;t do the option of working out at home. My body has been maintaining weight between 275~277 from the 288 when we had started this. </p>
