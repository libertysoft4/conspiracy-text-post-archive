<blockquote>
<p>&quot;The forensic evidence that links network breaches to known groups is solid: used and reused tools, methods, infrastructure, even unique encryption keys. For example: in late March the attackers registered a domain with a typo—misdepatrment[.]com—to look suspiciously like the company hired by the DNC to manage its network, MIS Department. They then linked this deceptive domain to a long-known APT 28 so-called X-Tunnel command-and-control IP address, 45.32.129[.]185.</p>

<p>One of the strongest pieces of evidence linking GRU to the DNC hack is the equivalent of identical fingerprints found in two burglarized buildings: a reused command-and-control address—176.31.112[.]10—that was hard coded in a piece of malware found both in the German parliament as well as on the DNC’s servers.</p>

<p>Russian military intelligence was identified by the German domestic security agency BfV as the actor responsible for the Bundestag breach. The infrastructure behind the fake MIS Department domain was also linked to the Berlin intrusion through at least one other element, a shared SSL certificate.&quot; (

)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The evidence that state-directed Russian hacking is responsible for the DNC breach is, in other words, more than circumstantial.</p>

<p>An important part of the hack was a so-called &#39;spear-phishing&#39; campaign that attempted to emulate legitimate websites to pilfer credentials and even maintain a persistent connection to a secure session:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;The short links in the spearphishing emails redirected victims to a TG-4127-controlled URL that spoofed a legitimate Google domain. A Base64-encoded string containing the victim&#39;s full email address is passed with this URL, prepopulating a fake Google login page displayed to the victim. If a victim enters their credentials, TG-4127 can establish a session with Google and access the victim&#39;s account. The threat actors may be able to keep this session alive and maintain persistent access.&quot;</p>

<p>The forensic evidence left by the hacks (C&amp;C IP addresses, spoofed certificates, encryption codes) point to Russian sources due to similarities between these intrusions and previous ones in Germany, Georgia, Latvia and other confirmed breaches.</p>

<p>Again, <em>this has been out since July,</em> including evidence that &quot;Guccifer 2.0&quot; is a smokescreen persona:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;ThreatConnect is the first to identify and detail analysis of Guccifer 2.0’s operational infrastructure. In our original hypothesis, we suspected Guccifer 2.0 might be leveraging French infrastructure to communicate with the global media, and we have validated this finding with the help of the media. As more details continue to surface surrounding Guccifer 2.0, we continue to identify heavy traces of Russian activity, from the specific Russian-based VPN service provider, domain registrants, and registrars as well as various discrete events that have circumstantial marks of Russian origins.</p>

<p>As we pointed out in our previous analysis, we conclude Guccifer 2.0 is an apparition created under a hasty Russian D&amp;D campaign, which has clearly evolved into an Active Measures Campaign. Those who are operating under the Guccifer 2.0 Twitter, WordPress and Email communications are likely made up a cadre of non-technical politruk attempting to establish “Guccifer 2.0” as a static fixture on the world stage along the likes of Manning, Assange or Snowden. Their use of Russian VPN services with French infrastructure may shed light on a method Russian intelligence operatives use — domestic services coupled with foreign infrastructure — to help hide their hand and deter any potential attribution to Russia.&quot;</p>

<p>There is plenty of forensic evidence to parse through. Yes, sure, it&#39;s <em>possible</em> that DNC networks were compromised by APT28 / APT29 (Cozy Bear and Lazy Bear) <em>and</em> that the leak did originate from another, third (possibly internal?) source. </p>

<p>After all, it&#39;s a very bold and risky play to deliberately use cyberwarfare capabilities to leak internal documents in lieu of traditional espionage: it compromises quiet ongoing surveillance in favor of a ploy that may or may not work, and could even spectacularly backfire. But it&#39;s also compatible with an emboldened Russian foreign policy. </p>

<p>And certainly it&#39;s also possible that the leak had far more wide-ranging influences that anyone intended, and all the players are caught off guard here and just improvising. (In fact that&#39;s more likely: only in movies does the villain &#39;foresee&#39; events 12 steps in advance).</p>

<p>And the evidence is more than circumstantial. Cozy Bear and Fancy Bear left significant fingerprints over the crime scene, from the command and control IP addresses, to the specific code and exploits used, to the Cyrillic settings on leaked documents; again, read the third-party security analyses for yourself. We don&#39;t have to just take someone&#39;s word for it, even though the American intelligence community is unanimous in its assessment here.</p>

<p>So: there is evidence; it&#39;s <em>not</em> a slam dunk, but pretty close; and there are many unanswered questions still.</p>

<hr/>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong> </p>

<p>I&#39;m just a normal dude with a kid and a messy house and I don&#39;t have time to answer everyone. There are thoughtful comments downthread that discuss the limits of this evidence, such as it is, and other comments that are less useful. I acknowledge that the forensics are compatible with a lot of possibilities (including a massive conspiracy to start a war!), but some of these possibilities seem very remote to me. Follow the links, read what&#39;s there, and make up your own minds. </p>

<p>I just wanted to say: there <em>is</em> evidence, not <em>no</em> evidence as some were saying. It is in the nature of evidence that it does not form a deductive logical proof. So it goes. You don&#39;t have to just &#39;take someone&#39;s word for it,&#39; even if that someone is the PoTUS and 17 intelligence agencies...</p>

<p>I mean, look, how likely is it really that we&#39;re off to war with Russia when, in 30-odd days, Rex Tillerson will be Secretary of State? You know, the guy who supports removing sanctions from Russia over Crimea and has the Russian Order of Friendship medal? This is not a pretext for WWIII. If you watched Obama&#39;s press conference he talked multilateral frameworks to curb cyberwarfare between states, not thermonuclear armageddon. Y&#39;all need to calm down.</p>

<p><strong>2nd Edit</strong>: I&#39;ve been pointed to this write-up: <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/5ijhug/we_need_an_independent_public_investigation_of/db8yhon/">https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/5ijhug/we_need_an_independent_public_investigation_of/db8yhon/</a></p>
