        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>The videos depicting the recent threats to  the YouTuber/voat user are contrived. Here&#39;s a link showing how easy it is to switch a few things around in html to fake a Facebook conversation. </p>

<p>But something else stinks here... The subversion.. . The selling out of &quot;one of our own&quot;. </p>

<p>It&#39;s the dirty dispicable tactics of dirty dispicable men. <strong>Alefantis &amp;  Co.</strong>.</p>

<p>Alefantis was on Fox news. He&#39;s likely guilty of some crime or another. He&#39;s likely got some powerful people who would be exposed if his operation isn&#39;t top notch. Those people grit their teeth harder and harder the more pictures, videos, and evidence is raised. I guarantee they are pissed as hell. </p>

<p>So the last desperate tactic of a man who&#39;s days are numbered is to desperately try and undermine pizzagate from the inside out. It&#39;s to Take a look in at the interworkings of the investigation via voat and find it&#39;s dirty fucking whore of Babylon. </p>

<p><strong>The one fucking cunt to monetize the investigation of pizzagate</strong>. </p>

<p>He&#39;s already proven himself as a whore. Ask yourself: who the fuck tries to make money off pizzagate? His excuse: raise awareness; of course. A likely story. And Alex Jones is just trying to raise awareness of magical Nigerian breast milk. </p>

<p>What&#39;s more likely is that some of these creepy uncles playing on JAs team took one look at voat and knew exactly who to co opt for this scheme. </p>

<p>To what end? Simple. To add a &quot;pack of lies&quot; to the real pizzagate ammunition. To get everyone in a big fucking uproar calling authorities, just to have the user and Alefantis say &quot;OK it&#39;s fake news&quot; in a well choreographed stroke of PR. </p>

<p>I just hope it doesn&#39;t work.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Wait, so whats your theory? </p>

<p>That the pizzagate allegations are by and large true, that Alefantis knows his time is just about up as a free man, so to protect his equally incriminated associates he makes himself into a patsy by delivering overt threats to someone they found on voat? Or is it that he tries to turn the vlogger into a patsy, seeing that he&#39;s easily portrayed as a profiteer, whereby the entire pizzagate conspiracy can be sold on the news as some kind of fake-news-moneygrab?</p>

<p>I can see how his profiteering can be turned into an effective smear, but do you really think the entire story is engineered? Strikes me as unlikely, but who knows. I won&#39;t put it past them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>One of the theories on this I saw was that Alefantis is beginning to realize his time might be up and TPTB might make him a patsy to keep themselves safe. He&#39;s beginning to see his power base erode and is losing influence so he is getting a little unhinged.  </p>

<p>TPTB turning on him is explained by the massive MSM movement against pizzagate and fake news, so when they sell out Alefantis there is a precedent for fake news and can claim much of it was manufactured based on Alefantis&#39;s trafficking behavior. The story can be spun that Alefantis was a real perpetrator but the fake news onslaught spun out of control because of his behavior and everyone else are really just innocent bystanders incorrectly guilty by association.  </p>

<p>I don&#39;t know if I buy into the second part of the theory, but Alefantis beginning to become unhinged is totally believable and likely.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Cool. But you think his becoming unhinged (i.e. threatening a dude and his family via facebook) is itself a ploy to direct the entire pizzagate spotlight back onto him? I mean, I can see that being the case. After all, I find it hard to believe he would issue relatively overt threats as he did in text form, something easily preserved, screenshotted and publicized; to a pizzagate vlogger with quite a following of all things. I suppose the real threats were issued on phone and for some admittedly suspicious reason none of these phone calls were recorded (I accept the first call after a 10-second ultimatum would be difficult to record, but there were other calls with more time to prepare), but still, there&#39;s enough obviously threatening language in the messages themselves to make me suspicious of Alefantis&#39; sense of vigilance in times of increased visibility of any of his actions. Weird, at any rate.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Check the edit I just made because the though came to me after I hit submit on the comment :(</p>

<p>What I&#39;m thinking is that getting to the level of political and social influence Alefantis has takes a lot of drive and ruthlessness. This level of drive and ruthlessness often is a sign of certain types of sociopathy and when threatened people like this often lose their shit and forget long term consequences in interactions like the one we see in the video and begin saying things via text, email, and phone that they normally wouldn&#39;t otherwise. The stress causes the sociopath to forget their &quot;veil&quot; and the veil drops briefly revealing their true personality.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks, I missed the edit at first. I think Corbett is pretty spot on in his view of these things. The blackmail angle on the pedo shit is the strongest explanation in my view, with the satanic ritual angle being more or less an additional layer that only few amongst these people take to heart (some definitely do). </p>

<p>It&#39;s a bit like drugs in that effect, that most will do it for the fun (and certainly there are diddlers out there who diddle purely for &quot;fun&quot;, ugh, makes me sick to even write that shit), while a handful will do it to push the boundaries of their own psyche to become &quot;bigger&quot; in a sense. I won&#39;t push this comparison any further though, as I am a pretty strong proponent of responsible drug use, even or especially to become bigger persons through it, and I don&#39;t think the two illicit practices are anything alike beyond that. But if someone has you on tape doing either of these things, you&#39;ve become that person&#39;s puppet by means of leverage and blackmail, that&#39;s for sure.</p>

<p>Interesting viewpoint on the sociopathic tell-tale signs of Alefantis himself. It definitely looked and sounded like he lost his cool in his conversation with the vlogger, while maintaining a palpable arrogance that he&#39;s got the bigger stick. It&#39;ll be interesting to see all this play out.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree with you also. I think the ritual stuff is a way of formalizing the process and I doubt many people buy into it at first. Many religions and organizations use ritual in this manner (for example the Lords Prayer) to create fellowship and as a mnemonic tool for memorization. Maybe by the time you&#39;ve climber the ladder you have convinced yourself much of the bullshit has value, because it appears to work for you (see: Tom Cruise and Scientology for example).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Are you suggesting the video creator used Google Chrome&#39;s inspect tool to edit variables in the code and make it appear like he was talking to James Alefantis? Switching the original corner photo out for the one on his public profile and changing the text block of his name to make it accurate?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I believe that this is a strawman. Alefantis is redirecting attention to the Pegasus Museum and trying to build up for another false flag attack. The more &quot;loonies&quot; who barge into these places, the worse it looks for the investigators. It has also been foreshadowed.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Here is the thing: either Ryan faked it or not.  And either you are damage control for Alefantis or not.  I do not know you, but I know if this guy is lying about the convo, he is calling either a bullet or a lawsuit to him, all to make $0.90 per tshirt.</p>

<p>Ryan brought this on himself.  IMO, I think he is a confused guy that doesn&#39;t know what to do, so he posts it, pulls it, posts it.  Who can know.  I am going to watch and see how it rolls.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>One of the theories on this I saw was that Alefantis is beginning to realize his time might be up and TPTB might make him a patsy to keep themselves safe. He&#39;s beginning to see his power base erode and is losing influence so he is getting a little unhinged.  </p>

<p>TPTB turning on him is explained by the massive MSM movement against pizzagate and fake news, so when they sell out Alefantis there is a precedent for fake news and can claim much of it was manufactured based on Alefantis&#39;s trafficking behavior. The story can be spun that Alefantis was a real perpetrator but the fake news onslaught spun out of control because of his behavior and everyone else are really just innocent bystanders incorrectly guilty by association.  </p>

<p>I don&#39;t know if I buy into the second part of the theory, but Alefantis beginning to become unhinged is totally believable and likely.</p>
