    <div class="md"><p>Why would you do that? Some poor cleaner guy that gets paid minimum wage or less is going to have to clean up your shit, not the people you&#39;re actually pissed off at. This is a peeve I have with a lot of the conspiracy community (and people in general). They&#39;re pissed off, but they can&#39;t just walk up and slap Obama or Clinton or Trump, or whoever, so they take their anger and disrespect out on honest people just trying to eek out a living that have nothing to do with anything. If you&#39;re angry, then you either need to find a way to take it up with those you actually deserve your anger and disrespect, or you need to learn how to let it go. Being an ass to the peeons, that are likely getting a shorter end of the stick in life than you are, is <em>not</em> going to make this world a better place. Which is the goal of all of this actually is, right? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>On #J20 General Strike there may be a large militant protest in the streets in a City near you.  In my city, there are already 25K signed up on Facebook which means at least 12K will show up.  These numbers may be enough to put the police on their best behavior.  We&#39;ll see.</p>

<p>Then the next day on #J21 there is a Million <del>Vagina</del> Women march to try to preserve choice nationwide. This event also looks Yuuuuge (as Bernie would say).  Problem: In LA the planned route takes the protest right in front of LAPD Parker Center where we are just a donut&#39;s throw from thousands of riot cops.  Help, please.</p>

<p>I&#39;m going to risk being overbearing in this response and give you a link to a comment about <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Political_Revolution/comments/4tkqgt/sanders_delegation_plotting_in_public_and/d5icne8/">Protesting the DNC</a> but which is also generally helpful for newbies.

<p>Also, select -one- article or focused topic &amp; mail printed copues to friends as an invite to a &quot;bookclub&quot; meeting to discuss. Wine, snacks. Leave cells off in a distant room of the house, have low tech timer so any parents who need to go to that room to check on babysitters can chill out. When printing, increase margins &amp; add an inked question or two, draw arrows, plant seeds for talking when they come to your event. Few people or many, probly hard to have one convo with more than 8-10 people, consider breaking into two rooms if too many at once, then gather later to share main ideas.</p>
