<p>We have started wars over Democracy    </p>

<p>Millions of people have died for Democracy    </p>

<p>My childhood friend died in Iraq fighting for Democracy   </p>

<p>The MSM, CIA, and other powerful people are writing headlines, asking us to be &quot;outraged&quot; over Russia hacking and undermining our Democracy     </p>

<p>My Grandfathers fought and died, in all major American wars, for Democracy    </p>

<p>Debbie Wasserman Schultz, Clinton, and the DNC <strong>Undermine Our Own Democracy.</strong> Where&#39;s the outrage now? Huh? MSM? CIA? Congress? FBI? Where is the outrage? Who is going to jail?    </p>

<p>Thought so.   </p>

<p>Tell me, who is it that is full of shit?     </p>

<p>Edit:</p>

<p>For those saying this is normal, it&#39;s actually really not. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;The release provides further evidence the DNC broke its own charter violations by favoring Clinton as the Democratic presidential nominee, long before any votes were cast.&quot;</p>

<p>To those saying, &quot;there&#39;s no specific law against this.&quot; This arguably is fraud. Fraud is usually covered under law. Maybe not here -- that&#39;s what the post is about.</p>

<p>Arguably, undermining the second most important democratic process in the country could also fall under treason.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>In most countries the parties select their candidates, not the voters. This is how it was in America throughout much of our history as well. Our current system is unusual and has no actual basis in law. The Constitution says nothing about political parties or primary elections, for instance. That&#39;s not to excuse the DNC&#39;s actions; they shouldn&#39;t put up the pretense of a democratic process if they don&#39;t plan to be faithful to it, that&#39;s dishonest and manipulative. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not sure if there&#39;s any case law on this or not. Typically, evidence is thrown out if the <em>police</em> obtained it illegally, usually in an illegal search without a warrant, but in this case, it was not the police (or FBI in this case) that illegally procured it; it was either hacked or leaked by a third party. </p>

<p>A physical analogue would be if a third party stole a video tape of a murder, which was then recovered by the police through legal means. There might be a challenge about chain of custody, but I would guess most judges would admit it as evidence depending on circumstances. </p>

<p>With the wikileaks emails, I don&#39;t think they would be thrown out because they were acquired through illegal means, but the defense would almost certainly argue that they cannot be authenticated. While wikileaks might have a spotless record, that&#39;s not sufficient for the court. Some of the emails have DKIM verification, which might hold up in court, but I&#39;m not sure it&#39;s ever been tested. </p>

<p>It&#39;s also possible that the FBI could try to obtain a warrant to retrieve the &quot;original&quot; emails from DNC or Google servers, but the defense would likely challenge this as well, claiming the probable cause would not have been known without the illegal leaking of the emails in the first place. In any case, it&#39;s pretty uncharted territory, and even if there were a conviction, it would likely go through several rounds of appeals. </p>

<p>As much as I might like prosecutions to go through in this case, I do worry about the potential precedent. Similar to how <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallel_construction">parallel construction</a> has been used to build cases originally discovered by illegal means, the government could conceivably masquerade as &quot;leakers,&quot; posting evidence on wikileaks or other sites, and then use that as the basis for a legal warrant to obtain the evidence. </p>

The fact is that in many lower income, pro Bernie Sanders areas, people cant afford to wait in line for 6+ hours. Most working class jobs won&#39;t give employees off specifically for election day. There are many ways the DNC screwed Bernie out of the nomination, while only some were technically illegal, all were unethical. </p>

The left is screaming about how Russia helped to get Donald Trump elected through &quot;hacks&quot; now its conveniently changing to &quot;and propaganda&quot; now too. Also half the dems supporters don&#39;t believe there was anything unfair about the election bc they didn&#39;t bother to see what was in Hillary&#39;s emails and to read anything not published by NYT or the Wash Post of Huff Post.

<p>1) Publish rules about how you will choose a product/candidate</p>

<p>2) Solicit hundreds of millions of dollars of contributions to choose that product/candidate based on the rules</p>

<p>3) Then instead subvert the entire process and choose the product/candidate internally </p>

<p>This would seem to indicate a pretty clear case of fraud. The RICO Act is typically used to go after corrupt organizations, like the DNC, that engage in orchestrated fraud.   </p>

<p>Sanders raised $300M. All of that money was contributed in the earnest belief that the DNC was running a genuine contest. Instead, all that money went towards the creation of a series of theatrical events, designed to make the DNC&#39;s chosen product appear more viable.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>We&#39;re not talking traditional &quot;machine&quot; politics here - of the type practiced by Harry Reid in Nevada, or, going back in history, Tammany Hall in NY. When party apparatchiks use their office to mobilize voters, it&#39;s business as usual. </p>

<p>The DNC&#39;s machinations throughout this primary cycle were on a whole other level. Thanks to WL, we have visibility into the corruption in a way that (at least to my recollection) is entirely novel. Yes, parties have gotten away with this kind of dirt in the past, but it was all easily swept under the carpet. </p>

<p>It&#39;s kind of funny that Hillary et al are engaged in such a desperate attempt to rewrite the history of the election, given as there&#39;s little practical benefit to be had, other than undermining Trump&#39;s legitimacy.</p>

<p>I kind of hope they push him hard enough that he has no choice but to push back. Trump has already endorsed the narrative that Hillary robbed Sanders. If the Dems continue to push that Putin robbed Hillary, maybe Trump sees his way to appointing a special prosecutor for Hillary and the DNC after all. </p>

<p>Statistic analysis of exit poll data suggests that votes were tampered with in the Democratic Party presidential primaries in over 10 states. The worst instances suggest tampering to the tune of around 15%. All states on the Republican side show no indication of fraud and most states on the Democratic Party side show no indication of fraud either. It&#39;s also been proven many times over that hacking votes is really easy on machines commonly used, and it can be done without leaving any evidence of it. </p>

<p>There are also videos of poll workers whiting out ballots and destroying them. Not to mention the caucus riggings also caught on video clear as day. </p>

<p>Contrary to popular American opinion, US wars are fought for the Federal Reserve, banksters, fruit companies, oil companies, military industrial complex and whoever&#39;s paying the politicians.

    <div class="md"><p>It wasn&#39;t rigged.  There is no evidence at all that they rigged any part of the primary.  The DNC having a preference on who wins the primary is only logical, not remotely evidence of any wrongdoing.  Any organization would have an idea who it wants to lead it.  </p>

<p>Election fraud is already illegal.  What they allegedly &quot;did&quot; is not election fraud.  You can&#39;t make it any more illegal than it already is.  </p>

<p>The DNC is not beholden to you or the American public.  It&#39;s a private orginization.  </p>

<p>The RNC made <strong>public statements</strong> about how <strong>horrible of a choice Trump was</strong> to represent it and you don&#39;t seem to care.  The DNC made private statements about who it would prefer to run it and it&#39;s apparently that was so egrigious it warrants changing the law.  Grow up.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>At the very lease, the actions by Debbie Wasserman Schultz and the DNC leadership prior to Schultz&#39;s DNC chair resignation certainly violated internal DNC impartiality rules. And the actions of Donna Brazille in revealing upcoming questions to Clinton&#39;s team behind the scenes also violated those same impartiality rules both at the DNC and the Commission on Presidential Debates. And it violated basic journalistic integrity and ethics. </p>

<p>Did any of this violate federal election law? I think a case could be made here. I think a federal prosecutor should be assigned the task of determining if such violated election law. And I think the Justice Department wouldn&#39;t touch this without explicit direction from the Executive to do just that. Because &#39;prosecutorial prerogative&#39; blah blah.</p>

<p>The GOP has engaged in all kinds of dirty tricks with voter registration rolls. And I don&#39;t doubt they&#39;d do exactly the same thing the DNC was just caught doing. I mean, Watergate. </p>

<p>But what we have here is a complete breakdown in basic ethics at the very top of the political party structure. Nobody following these stories should trust anything any of these people in the respective party leaderships says. Because they&#39;ve all proven themselves liars and crooks. </p>

<p>So the question becomes: with corruption endemic throughout the political system, what can citizens do to demand basic representation from elected officials and the bureaucratic structures that surround them? And I don&#39;t have an answer to that. </p>

<p>A few show trial prosecutions won&#39;t solve endemic corruption. </p>

Also, possibly, donors to his campaign would have standing, because they were misled to believe that the DNC was impartial, although it&#39;s kind of a stretch.

    <div class="md"><p>I believe it because, the political dirty tricks attributed to the DNC were in fact conducted and executed by the very conservative operation that conducted the entire election to deliver the what was really a slow moving coup. One group coordinated the entire show, including the faked polling, the narrative and media messaging, determined who got to vote in all the red states and had all the control needed for last minute vote count adjustments.</p>

<p>Really the only question is,  Did Hillary know how entirely fake and deceitful this election was?  I lean to thinking she was promised a win, just like Romney was promised a win, Romney lost, this time no dirty op or political  dirty trick was left undone.

<p>See, that&#39;s the point. It&#39;s fraud. Fraud is usually covered under law.</p>

<p>If you hire a lawyer, a doctor, a real estate agent, most anything, and they tell you they are doing one thing and do another - it doesn&#39;t matter that &quot;they are a private organization and can break their own rules.&quot; It&#39;s fraud. </p>

<p>Whether or not any law specifically covers this -- well that&#39;s up for the courts to decide -- but something is not legal simply because &quot;they are a private organization and can break their own rules.&quot; A lot of people are saying that, but it isn&#39;t true.</p>

<p>Its top down</p>

<p>Keep seeing posts trying to equate sanders with the narrative that hes controlled opposition, don&#39;t believe it</p>

<p>Fellow long time friend of the clintons and current and always swamp resident trump is more like</p>

<p>Ofcourse a HRC presidency would&#39;ve been disastrous, but trump is the sidekick anti-hero where anti-establishment sentiments could congregate. Angry needs an alternative choice, AKA controlled opposition.</p>

<p>Lets talk about the obviously fake russia hacking story - a lie. Lets also try to equate this bullshit story with trumps success(legitimate). That&#39;ll get trump supporters revv&#39;ed up to collect liberal tears.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, we&#39;re divided because liberals emotions keep getting trolled because half the democrats are watching &#39;real news&#39;.</p>

<p>Can&#39;t i just wake up from this unending nightmare?</p>

<p>Some of the most upvoted posts of all time on Reddit are the post-election posts supporting &#39;it should have been Bernie&#39; theme. I think we got screwed. It should have been Bernie. Instead we got Clinton vs Trump forced down our throats and ended up with Trump.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>In most countries the parties select their candidates, not the voters. This is how it was in America throughout much of our history as well. Our current system is unusual and has no actual basis in law. The Constitution says nothing about political parties or primary elections, for instance. That&#39;s not to excuse the DNC&#39;s actions; they shouldn&#39;t put up the pretense of a democratic process if they don&#39;t plan to be faithful to it, that&#39;s dishonest and manipulative. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It wasn&#39;t rigged.  There is no evidence at all that they rigged any part of the primary.  The DNC having a preference on who wins the primary is only logical, not remotely evidence of any wrongdoing.  Any organization would have an idea who it wants to lead it.  </p>

<p>Election fraud is already illegal.  What they allegedly &quot;did&quot; is not election fraud.  You can&#39;t make it any more illegal than it already is.  </p>

<p>The DNC is not beholden to you or the American public.  It&#39;s a private orginization.  </p>

<p>The RNC made <strong>public statements</strong> about how <strong>horrible of a choice Trump was</strong> to represent it and you don&#39;t seem to care.  The DNC made private statements about who it would prefer to run it and it&#39;s apparently that was so egrigious it warrants changing the law.  Grow up.</p>
