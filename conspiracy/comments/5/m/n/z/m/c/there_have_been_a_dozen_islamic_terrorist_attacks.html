</ul>

<p>This can be taken one of two ways:
1) They are in on it.
2) They aren&#39;t fully capable of providing security, and the promises they make shouldn&#39;t be trusted, e.g. Russian hacking and their ability to vet refugees.</p>

<p>I think it would also be worthwhile to list what factors the current staged attack has in common with previous staged attacks: muslim, two shooters reduced to one shooter, etc......</p>

<p>All the FBI had to do was dig on this new guy. This guys been an extremest sense he was 17 and has a Muslim name. He was downloading propaganda on a weapons and explosives website. I&#39;m mean come on really? Then we send him to fight? His family knew as well. I don&#39;t want to post to many links over rules you know (roll the eyes now). </p>

<p>Btw we do all know how the Obama administration.. ( here is a quick list)</p>

<p>a) has allowed the Muslim Brotherhood or people connected to them to visit the White House ) </p>

<p>b) has given at least one suspected terrorist with MB ties a top secret clearance and position within DHS here in Texas <a href="http://libertynews.com/2012/02/the-case-of-muslim-brotherhood-tied-mohamed-elibiary-and-his-dhs-top-security-clearance/">The Case of Muslim Brotherhood-Tied Mohamed Elibiary and His DHS Top Security Clearance</a></p>

<p>1b (and the Orlando shooter worked for a company as a security guard, with a firearm, contacted by DHS) as well. <a href="https://www.google.com/amp/www.foxnews.com/politics/2016/06/13/orlando-killer-worked-for-dhs-state-contractor-that-helps-secure-us-embassies.amp.html?client=ms-android-sprint-us">Slipped through the cracks: Orlando killer worked for DHS, State contractor</a></p>

<p>3b Obama is cozy with a long list of MBs in his administration <a href="http://www.nachumlist.com/brotherhood.htm">Obama and the Muslim Brotherhood </a></p>

<p>c) required all agencies to scrub any mention of Islamic or jihad from their law enforcement materials and Ted Cruz was questioned why at a hearing but of course no real answers.<br/>

<blockquote>
<p>Muhammad was investigated by the FBI&#39;s Joint Terrorism Task Force when he returned. The Task Force also investigated the suspect&#39;s visit to Columbus, Ohio; authorities had monitored some Somali Americans traveling from there to Somalia to &quot;wage jihad.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>His attendance at the Falls Church mosque was in the same period as that of Nawaf al-Hazmi and Hani Hanjour, two of the hijackers in the September 11 attacks, who went there from April 2001 to later in the summer.[117][118] A law enforcement official said that the FBI will probably look into whether Hasan associated with the hijackers.[119] A review of Hasan&#39;s computer and his e-mail accounts revealed he had visited radical Islamist websites, a senior law enforcement official said.[120]</p>

<p>Anwar al-Awlaki in 2008, with whom Hasan communicated in the months prior to the shootings
Hasan expressed admiration for the teachings of Anwar al-Awlaki, the imam at the Dar al-Hijrah mosque in Falls Church, Virginia between 2000 and 2002. Awlaki had been the subject of several FBI investigations, and had helped hijackers al-Hazmi and Hanjour settle, and provided spiritual guidance to them when they met him at the San Diego mosque, and after they drove to the east coast.[121] Considered moderate then, Al-Awlaki appeared to become radicalized after 2006 and was under surveillance. After Hasan wrote nearly 20 e-mails to him between December 2008 and June 2009, Hasan was investigated by the FBI. The fact that Hasan had &quot;certain communications&quot; with the subject of a Joint Terrorism Task Force investigation was revealed in an FBI press release made on November 9, 2009,[122] and reporting by the media immediately revealed that the subject was Awlaki and the communications were e-mails.[123] In one, Hasan wrote: &quot;I can&#39;t wait to join you&quot; in the afterlife. Lt. Col. Tony Shaffer, a military analyst at the Center for Advanced Defense Studies, suggested that Hasan was &quot;either offering himself up or [had] already crossed that line in his own mind.&quot;</p>

<h1>3</h1>

<blockquote>
<p>On November 11, 2009, British intelligence officials sent the U.S. a cable indicating that a man named &quot;Umar Farouk&quot; had spoken to al-Awlaki, pledging to support jihad, but the cable did not give Abdulmutallab&#39;s last name.[dead link][65] On November 19, Abdulmutallab&#39;s father consulted with two CIA officers at the U.S. Embassy in Abuja, Nigeria, reporting his son&#39;s &quot;extreme religious views&quot;,[7][66] and told the embassy that Abdulmutallab might be in Yemen.[10][21][35][67] Acting on the report, the CIA added the suspect&#39;s name in November 2009 to the US&#39;s 550,000-name Terrorist Identities Datamart Environment, a database of the National Counterterrorism Center (NCTC).</p>
</blockquote>

<h1>4</h1>

<blockquote>
<p>The brothers are Muslim, with Tamerlan&#39;s aunt stating that he had recently become a devout Muslim.[180][181] Tamerlan, since 2009, became more devout and religious,[189][190] and a YouTube channel in his name linked to Salafist[189] and Islamist[187][191][192] videos. The FBI was informed by the Russian Federal Security Service (FSB) in 2011 that he was a &quot;follower of radical Islam.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<h1>5</h1>

<blockquote>
<p>The check kiting scam involved depositing bad checks, and then withdrawing cash before the checks were returned. Authorities believed that the effort was to fund militant Islamist terrorist groups in Somalia, but were unable to prove the link. Brown was convicted of bank fraud in federal court in 2005 and served time in prison.</p>
</blockquote>

<h1>6</h1>

<blockquote>
<p>Prosecutors said he told FBI agents that he had not discussed traveling to Somalia to engage in &quot;violent jihad&quot; -- when, in fact, he had, according to an indictment.</p>
</blockquote>

<h1>7</h1>

<blockquote>
<p>as part of her visa application with the State Department and application for a green card, Malik submitted her fingerprints and underwent &quot;three extensive national security and criminal background screenings&quot; using Homeland Security and State Department databases. Malik also underwent two in-person interviews, the first with a consular officer in Pakistan and the second with an immigration officer in the U.S. after applying for a green card.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Machete attacker who stormed Israeli-owned Ohio restaurant and slashed four was investigated by FBI for radical Islamist views four years ago</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The 2014 investigation was opened after he was linked to Moner Mohammad Abu Salha,[89] an American radical who committed a suicide bombing in Syria. Mateen was interviewed three times in connection with the two investigations.</p>

<p>Rahimi&#39;s father Mohammad had tried to contact the FBI about his son around August 2014, but two months later, Rahimi was cleared by the FBI.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Santiago visited the FBI field office in Anchorage in November 2016 and reported hearing voices in his head telling him to commit acts of violence. He also said that he was in control and did not intend to hurt anyone.[3][4][23] He also claimed that the U.S. government was controlling his mind, was making him watch videos by the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant[24] and added that the CIA was forcing him to join the group.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You missed option 3</p>

<p>3) People with strong religious beliefs, which are being presented as a threat to humanity, and are then under the scrutiny of the security services may well be more psychologically fragile than normal and may well become paranoid and delusion before committing a terrorist attack. </p>

<p>It&#39;s also possible that the perpetrators of these attacks was a risk that was being monitored but ineffectively and slipped through the net. A question that seems to be missing from your post and the replies is:</p>

<p>How many other Muslims are being contacted by the security services that don&#39;t then go on to be terrorists? If we knew the full scale of contact between the FBI and Islamic population, we would be able to see the percentage of these which have gone bad. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I dont know why you were downvoted for this... It seems like a good reply to me.</p>

<p>People use violence- just as they use most other things that effect change in their environment- as tools. The more a person feels under someone&#39;s control, the more likely they are to &quot;lash out&quot; against the system that instantiates that reality.</p>

<p>Its entirely plausible that the gov (FBI especially) is just too incompetent or is awash in too much information to meaningfully stop these sorts of attacks, and that the witchhunt mentality law enforcement has adopted towards muslims is actually exacerbating the problem (especially the ones where they are supposedly &quot;nuts&quot;). </p>

<p>Ive said this a number of times: the biggest problem in the US is that we are too divided- we have racists and sexists and islam-ophobes and and and... we have all these exclusion-ist prejudices that it seems some try to use to get a bigger slice of the remaining pie (since the majority of that pie is eaten by the 1%). If we want to see real change, we have to be <em>united</em> in realizing the real battle is one of <em>class warfare.</em></p>

<p>Im not suggesting populist redistributions of wealth- simply reforming things to be more egalitarian in terms of opportunity hopefully eventually causing a reduction in wealth inequality. Stop with the witchhunt mentality, stop with mass surveillance (that doesnt do shit) and law enforcement militarization, etc etc..</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Here&#39;s the list I compiled earlier (I see one match with yours):</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.oregonlive.com/portland/index.ssf/2010/12/portland_bomb_plot_case_likely.html">Portland Christmas tree bomber</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Since news of the arrest broke, pundits have seized on what they describe as the FBI&#39;s encouragement, support and funding of Mohamud&#39;s alleged attempt to bomb Portland&#39;s holiday tree-lighting ceremony. Many wondered whether the bureau&#39;s undercover operatives had coached him into the crime, and a headline in Salon reads, &quot;The FBI successfully thwarts its own terrorist plot.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The <a href="http://www.cnsnews.com/news/article/fbi-informant-close-entrapping-would-be-bomber">Wrigley Field bomber</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Attorneys for a young Lebanese immigrant who pleaded guilty to placing what he thought was a bomb in a backpack near Wrigley Field have disclosed FBI notes that indicate agents feared an informant might entrap the Chicago man during their investigation.</p>

<p>Sami Samir Hassoun admitted in a plea agreement last year that he took what he thought was a bomb from undercover FBI agents and put it into a trash bin near the home of the Chicago Cubs in the summer of 2010. He is due to be sentenced on April 12.</p>

<p>The informant played a central role by befriending Hassoun and later tipped off undercover FBI agents.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The first <a href="http://www.whatreallyhappened.com/RANCHO/POLITICS/OK/wtcbomb.html">World Trade Center bombing</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Law-enforcement officials were told that terrorists were building a bomb that was eventually used to blow up the World Trade Center, and they planned to thwart the plotters by secretly substituting harmless powder for the explosives, an informer said after the blast.</p>

<p>The informer was to have helped the plotters build the bomb and supply the fake powder, but the plan was called off by an F.B.I. supervisor who had other ideas about how the informer, Emad Salem, should be used, the informer said.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Heck, even the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bl6w1YaZdf8">9/11 terrorists</a>.</p>

<p>Also, the <a href="http://haskellfamily.blogspot.com/2011/09/colossal-deceit-known-as-underwear.html">underwear bomber</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>For those that are still skeptical of my claims, please realize that I do not make my claims without a great deal of thought and research. My firm belief is that Umar was escorted around security and given an intentionally defective bomb by a U.S. intelligence agent. The bomb was never intended to detonate, but merely intended to create a &quot;simulated terrorist attack&quot; or a &quot;false flag attack&quot; if you will.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>the answer is #2. The only purposes of staging terror attacks would be to spread racial division, which is not the stated nor directed purpose of TPTB. If you think it is (as some our there do today) you&#39;re nuts as countless billions upon billions of dollars are spent by global elites pushing &quot;multiculturalism&quot;. Hollywood, liberal media and every single politician liberal or conservative (so far except for Trump) pays lipservice to extolling the virtues of multiculturalism and how &quot;our strength is our virtue&quot;.</p>

<p>Anyone claiming the government is trying to spread racism is apparently vapidly unaware of the fact that racism <strong>was</strong> the norm only a couple of decades ago. It went away because of concerted efforts on the part of government and elites to spread pro multiculturalism messages and pass laws. <strong>To suggest the government is trying to stop multiculturalism, when it&#39;s the one that&#39;s patently responsible for creating it, it beyond ignorant and can only be motivated by someone with deep seeded left-wing beliefs that they prize over intellectual honesty.</strong></p>

<p>Here is the UNESCO (UN) page on multiculturalism - <a href="http://www.unesco.org/new/en/social-and-human-sciences/themes/international-migration/glossary/multiculturalism/">http://www.unesco.org/new/en/social-and-human-sciences/themes/international-migration/glossary/multiculturalism/</a></p>

<p>Note the policies are not in any way &quot;anti&quot; immigration or anything like that.</p>

<p>The reality of the matter is, if you read the written works of &quot;the elite&quot; in their own words. Pay attention to what happens at global summits and what policies are discussed by unelected, omnipotent officials at the UN. Watch videos like &quot;Bohemian Grove&quot;. Listen to The Nixon Tapes. Follow the trail of leakers and whistleblowers throughout the past few decades. Learn what secret societies that are influential in their circles, like Freemasonry, are all about, and quite plainly just open your eyes to the obvious truth of what&#39;s happening around you the answer is not that mystifying (though it may be terrifying).</p>

<p>You have a situation where global elites practice a religion of secular humanism, and they believe the only answer to stopping war, poverty, hunger and general division of any sort <strong>is to make everybody the same. This means multiculturalism and wealth redistribution.</strong></p>

<p>Their intentions may not be deliberately nefarious, though their methods certainly Machiavellian. What seems much more apparent that they suffer from some sort of delusional psychosis, a &quot;messiah complex&quot; (As George Soros himself has described himself as having) where they genuinely what they are doing is good and good for the world.</p>

<p>Unfortunately for all of us, they&#39;re wrong and they&#39;re delusional psychopaths who are ultimately going to create a world without any individuality, freedom or expression.</p>

<p>That&#39;s the real danger you all have to worry about. It&#39;s really not as up for debate as you might think as they practice their beliefs right out in the open for all to see (it&#39;s just the vast majority of humans don&#39;t bother to look). IMO they really aren&#39;t that difficult to predict or understand once you truly understand what their <strong>motives</strong> and <strong>ultimate goals</strong> are, so IMO you should all stick to that <strong>rather than falsely and irrationally believing &quot;ELITES ARE TRYING TO CREATE RACIAL DIVISION&quot; when the only reason the human race has anything resembling &quot;racial unity&quot; is literally and factually because of them in the first place.</strong></p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s #2 because the only reason we have anything remotely resembling &quot;racial unity&quot; in the human race today is specifically because of the elites. For over 100 years every policy, every program, every initiative set forth by the UN and other political bodies has focused on making the entire world more accessible for people of any race or creedo. </p>

<p>Their stated goal is, and always has been, to make the world &quot;one&quot;. One government. One race. One world. That idea did not exist in human nature before they showed up. They built it, they put it in the world, they put it in your mind. For anyone to suggest that shadowy government organizations are actually trying to instill racial division in our people is totally wrong and based on nothing more than an irrational, religious devotion to left-wing principles. </p>

<p>Racial division was the <strong>norm</strong>. It was the <strong>default</strong> state. The opposite only ever existed because of the concerted efforts on their parts to the contrary.</p>

<p>Read their own self-written works. Read about the policies of organizations like the UN. Read about what secret societies that are influential in their circles like Freemasonry is about. Read about the whistleblowers and leakers that have worked with our intelligence agencies over the years and come forward.</p>

<p>I&#39;m sorry, I know that the whole &quot;government wants to separate us by race&quot; meme is popular in &quot;left wing conspiracy&quot; circles today (even though I&#39;m still amazed that such a thing as &quot;left wing conspiracy theorist&quot; even exists as left wing = big government and conspiracy = distrust of government) but it&#39;s simply not the reality. It&#39;s simply not the demonstrable, provable reality of what these people are doing and have done for the past century and a half.</p>

<p>&quot;Multiculturalism&quot; <strong>is</strong> the openly stated and ardently striven for tool of the illuminati / bilderbergers / UN / freemasons / PTB / everything else you want to call them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I didn&#39;t read all of the links, but there&#39;s a pretty simple answer to most of them from what I can see:</p>

<p>Most of these people were investigated for planning to commit crimes but there wasn&#39;t enough evidence to convict them of anything and so they weren&#39;t able to arrest them. There are probably thousands of other people that are investigated by the FBI and CIA every year and it never turns into anything.</p>

<p>There are definitely some cases where law enforcement should have done more, but you can&#39;t throw someone in jail because you think they might do something if you don&#39;t have any evidence. For the people listed who acted without any collaboration with terrorist organizations it&#39;s pretty much impossible to prevent.</p>

I&#39;m pretty sure if the FBI had real evidence to prevent murders, they would. I would also hope the people they investigate are innocent until proven guilty, even if they are Muslim. There&#39;s a lot more deaths from gang and drug violence than radicalized Muslims in the US, which is where I hope the FBI is concentrating their efforts on.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The stupid thing is that the FBI investigated most of these people, i.e probably had leads on them (especially the one that was reported by his father). The intelligence agencies need concrete information about intent to commit a crime to do anything more than questioning, which is of course a good thing. But the real stupid thing is that even if you&#39;re suspected of intent to commit a crime, there&#39;s nothing that the entire intelligence and law enforcement community can do to stop your from ordering assault rifles online.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So Tashfeen Malik, and Abdul Razak Ali Artan just went through standard immigration procedures?</p>

<p>Interesting list, but your conclusions are bunk.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>They are in on it</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But every time they make the fatal mistake of telling us there was some kind of link to one of an assortment of departments/agencies? :\</p>

<blockquote>
<p>They aren&#39;t fully capable of providing security</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No shit. Even the Stasi couldn&#39;t do that. Do you want an agent assigned to every person in the country (and world if you don&#39;t want to stop all visitors and immigration)? Do you want to be imprisoned because you texted a previously convicted criminal on the off-chance this could led to you committing some sort of crime?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>promises they make shouldn&#39;t be trusted, e.g. Russian hacking and their ability to vet refugees</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is non sequitur. Because the government cannot stop all acts of terrorism?</p>

<p>Since you have an agenda why not tell us what you think is true, and what you think should be done about it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I wonder if this is a sign that the FBI et al. investigate too many people. It&#39;s an easy sell to say &quot;we should look at anyone even tangentially related to known terrorists&quot;, either to try and look for potential threats or even just to justify ever-increasing expenditures. However, I suspect it could lead to the pattern we are seeing here. For one, if you are investigating large numbers of people based on weak to no evidence, any investigation is likely to be superficial - it doesn&#39;t make sense to commit masses of resources to investigating someone at that stage - so unless there are any major red flags, they could be missed.</p>

<p>Secondly, it may lead to complacency in those conducting the investigations. If you&#39;ve looked at 100 people, and they all appear to living ordinary, normal lives, your attitude when looking at person 101 is likely very different than if you looked closely at a few specific individuals and found some percentage of them to be plotting an attack.</p>

<p>There&#39;s also the consideration that the interventions the FBI et al. can make are somewhat limited. Merely being a religious fanatic who believes violence can be justified in some situations isn&#39;t a crime (for good reason), so unless there is reason to believe the person is actually going to violently act on those beliefs, there isn&#39;t a great deal to be done. </p>
