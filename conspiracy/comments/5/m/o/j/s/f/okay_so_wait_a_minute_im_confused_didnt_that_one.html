        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>He said <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZQxYQ49p0U">here</a> that he was scared shitless, got death threats from Alefantis over having put up <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R7PcSf4Tj8o">this &quot;Kill Room&quot; video</a>, promised he would delete it, and just wants to be left alone now.</p>

<p>Uh...so why is that video not only still up...but apparently got <em>re</em>-uploaded?</p>

<p>Additionally - it actually does appear that it WAS Alefantis that he had a conversation with and not someone posing as Alefantis and trolling the user.  The user posted <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqMMm52CWxE">this video</a>, and it does appear to lend credence to the fact that he was in fact communicating with Alefantis himself via facebook.  He doesn&#39;t have the phone conversation he said he had with him, of course, but it does seem he communicated w/him via fb.</p>

<p>Sooo....It appears he did communicate w/Alefantis himself...so if Alefantis <em>did</em> in fact threaten his life and said he&#39;ll kill him and his family, mom, girlfriend, etc, etc unless he takes the &quot;Kill Room&quot; video down like the user said he did - and proceeded to send the user pictures of him and his mother, him and his girlfriend, etc, etc...and that user said he was genuinely scared shitless over this now (which I&#39;d understand) then why the fuck did he then repost the video itself that he said he got his and his family&#39;s life seriously threatened over?  Why does he still have it up?</p>

<p>What am I not getting here?</p>

<p>Anybody know more about this situation?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re saying this because at the end of one of his videos, he says &quot;And oh yeah.  Buy some pizzagategear t-shirts.&quot; with a shit eating grin on his face.</p>

<p>Yeah - it&#39;s a bit of an opportunist kind of sheist move, but as has been already mentioned on here by others, what he said in the video and the fear he seemed to definitely show in it didn&#39;t look like any sort of ploy to &quot;sell pizzagategear t-shirts!&quot;  That didn&#39;t seem like someone trying to spin some sale pitch ploy or gimmick to generate t-shirt sales.</p>

<p>This dynamic seems a bit deeper and more multifaceted to me than &quot;dude simply making shit up so he can sell more t-shirts&quot;, so jumping to that conclusion simply because he&#39;s plugging his product - sheisty and opportunistic as I acknowledge that seems to me - is something that can also be contextualized from the &quot;people are always trying to make a buck&quot; rationale.</p>

<p>Seems stupid on one level for him to have done that, but well...this IS the shit planet that we live on and we <em>are</em> still debt slaves that have to still make $ in order to live here - so yeah.  I don&#39;t see being scared, yet still trying to throw a quick plug in at the end to try to make some money as being <em>entirely</em> inconsistent within the context of this completely fucked up, totally backward world we already live in.</p>

<p>On top of all this, part of what I mentioned above in the OP is that the dude actually seems to show proof that he <em>did</em> in fact communicate with Alefantis himself at least via facebook - so that actually lends quite a bit of weight to his not making all this up.  It appears that he DID talk w/Alefantis, so the &quot;he&#39;s just lying to try to sell t-shirts&quot; angle doesn&#39;t really hold up to that data right there.</p>

<p>I&#39;m open to the possibility that the dude is in fact just being NOTHING but an opportunistic, sheisty liar and he is in fact making the entire thing up, but I&#39;m not convinced that he is, and a quick, 10 second plug to a product he&#39;s trying to make money with at the end of a video where for 10 minutes he seems to be genuinely scared and is telling people to NOT go to Alefantis&#39; place and STOP investigating pizzagate doesn’t seem to be enough to me to conclude he’s just making it all up at this point - again, <em>especially</em> when he seems to show proof that he did in fact communicate with Alefantis via facebook.</p>

<p>That’s actually part of the very point I’m trying to make though.  This kind of goes against what you were stating above because this shows that Alefantis DID threaten the dude, no?  If the real agenda, as you said, is “don’t mess w/Alefantis”, then that gets shown by this video actually being <em>true</em>…and not by being any sort of ploy to sell t-shirts.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>But then that would mean that the dude who made the video is either in on it (which I’m <em>really</em> not sure about)…or Alefantis <em>did</em> indeed threaten him to the extent that the dude claims - in which case the “don’t mess with Alefantis” angle certainly doesn’t keep someone like <em>me</em> and I feel quite a few other people from continuing to investigate pizzagate.  Heck, it gives many of us even <em>more</em> incentive to continue investigating because, if what this dude said is true, then Alefantis IS in fact in to some possibly EXTREMELY criminal shit…and that should <em>not</em> by any means just be ignored.  It needs to get found out, exposed, and rooted out.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Okay it&#39;s all good and well to say that...but to <em>what end?</em>  Like...making a video exposing Alefantis&#39; &quot;Kill Room&quot; is cointelpro for <em>what?</em>  I&#39;m willing to entertain that possibility, as this guy might somehow very well be &quot;in on it&quot;...but somebody&#39;s gotta ELI5 and spell it out for me how he&#39;s cointelpro because I&#39;m simply not getting the motivation or angle on it...</p>

<p>And no.  &quot;To sell more t-shirts&quot; doesn&#39;t seem to be a sufficiently logical reason to explain the cointelpro angle.</p>

<p>And even if selling more t-shirts IS his ultimate motivation...that wouldn&#39;t be cointelpro anyway.  That would just be some dude REALLY going above and beyond the call of lying to sell some t-shirts...which wouldn&#39;t make sense since, as <a href="/u/Putin_loves_cats">/u/Putin_loves_cats</a> mentioned, he&#39;s breaking a few crimes to do it, so it simply wouldn&#39;t be worth attempting to sell his t-shirts that way.  At all.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The general purpose of COINTELPRO operations is to <strong>debase and discredit</strong> a movement or idea by associating it with people who have poor character, are crazy, make weak connections, etc. </p>

<p>So with this pg8 guy: he is selling t-shirts, and creating videos that are (purposefully?) flimsy at best, claiming to have made contact with people but has no real proof. All of these little things discredit this guy to a real skeptic, and in turn discredit the ideas the agent is associated with. The result is that this skeptic associates the COINTELPRO agent with the idea (pg8).  Once an &quot;authority&quot; on a certain subject or idea (i.e. pg8) is established, this person can mix in truth with the other bullshit. Now all this person&#39;s ideas as a whole are discredited. </p>

<p>So the goal is to get people to think, &quot;Yeah I watched a couple of videos on pizza gate, all the people who talk about it are crazy. I watched one video where a guy claimed to make a phone call with the perpetrator, but couldn&#39;t make a recording even with another person in the room who could have helped.&quot;</p>

<p>However, it must be noted that I don&#39;t have any real evidence against this guy (ironic I know), but based on what I&#39;ve read about COINTELPRO I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if this were the case.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>So then that person isn’t “a real skeptic”.  They’re just someone who doesn’t have very good critical thinking skills since they’re associating one instance of something with the entire group - not the most intelligent thing to do.</p>

<p>I see what you’re getting at though.</p>

<p>So maybe the video maker is simply “in on it” for real, and, like you said, he’s been put in place to attempt to discredit those who are trying to look into pg8 by <em>posing</em> as a legitimate investigator when he’s really just cointelpro.</p>

<p>Okay.  Fair enough.</p>

<p>Thanks for the explanation of how this guy <em>could</em> be cointelpro.</p>

<p>Currently, I’m tentatively siding with the guy not being cointelpro since there is simply so much damning circumstantial evidence against Alefantis himself as it stands.  I would sooner give credence to the idea that Alefantis is threatening someone for making and possibly exposing the “Kill Room” video than that the video-maker is part of some elaborate plot to somehow get the trail off of Alefantis by making an even <em>more</em> damning video about him.</p>

<p>I don’t seek attention.  I have no followers.  I don’t do things for “clickthroughs”.  I have made exactly no money off anything I’ve done on the internet.  Hell, I’ve <em>lost</em> money.</p>

<p>The only agenda I have on the internet is to A) learn as much as I can about myself and the world, and B) kill time when I’m bored.</p>

<p>As such, and in my case, the answer to your questions isn’t “all of the above”.  The answer in my case is actually <em>”none</em> of the above”.</p>

<p>Is he really getting rammed down your throat though?  I mean maybe he is.  I’m not saying he’s not, but I wasn’t aware of any massive traction he’s gotten where everyone on the internet now knows about him.  Maybe I’m just not all the aware, however.  Definitely possible.</p>

<p>Because it’s relevant.</p>

<p>Possibly libeling a person who might be one of the most highly connected criminal pedophiles in the U.S. seems to be a crime that not too many people on the internet are already guilty of.</p>

<p>Had to lol over that...in a morbid way...</p>

<p>Yeah.  The point you&#39;re making - purposefully or not - is that there is most definitely enough evidence to at least being an official, formal investigation.</p>

<p>The &quot;official investigators&quot;, however, are empowered, payed, and employed by the very figures they would be investigating.  That makes getting to the bottom of things...difficult (understatement).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>How is the dude in on it when he&#39;s exposing things that weren&#39;t publicly available before and that other people might not have even realized?</p>

<p>And...in on <em>what</em> exactly?  What&#39;s he in on?  What&#39;s the angle on your thinking that he&#39;s in on it?  If he&#39;s in on it, then it would seem he&#39;s trying to <em>hide</em> Alefantis&#39; wrong doings, right?  I mean that&#39;s what being &quot;in&quot; on something means, right? - i.e. trying to protect it?</p>

<p>So if he&#39;s &quot;in&quot; on trying to hide Alefantis&#39; wrong doings...then how is his exposing Alefantis&#39; &quot;Kill Room&quot; helping Alefantis exactly or hiding anything about him?</p>

<p>It&#39;s like what <a href="/u/putin_loves_cats">/u/putin_loves_cats</a> said:  <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/5mojsf/okay_so_wait_a_minute_im_confused_didnt_that_one/dc55x9l/">&quot;is someone desperate enough to damn near commit 3 crimes (possibly felonies) in order to sell some t-shirts?&quot;</a></p>

<p>Even if pizza means what you just interpreted above, the criminality of the action is no less punishable - so a <em>lot</em> of people should absolutely <em>still</em> be investigated and possibly put in prison.</p>

<p>And let&#39;s not even talk about what would happen if &quot;pizza&quot; stands for what it&#39;s more often being interpreted as.  And there is a lot more circumstantial evidence pointing to &quot;pizza&quot; meaning pedophilia than cocaine.</p>

<p>Regardless of what exactly it means, however, the fact of the matter is that you just finished going back on your original attempt to apply Occam&#39;s Razor to this case (that &quot;pizza is just pizza&quot;) because you here just admitted that &quot;pizza&quot; is most definitely <em>not</em> referring to just &quot;pizza&quot;.</p>

<p>But it would seem that a great deal of what is going on directly involves Alefantis, so continuing with anything related to him <em>wouldn’t</em> be totally irrelevant in that sense.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>everyone is focused on such a tiny portion of the picture... Alefantis&#39; boat is sunk... it sank long ago... but piling more evidence on it now isn&#39;t gonna make him go to jail any quicker.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Perhaps part of the reason why focus on Alefantis continues is because A) he’s the biggest red flag that’s been uncovered thus far, B) none of the other snakes have been uncovered yet, and C) he may very well be hiding a lot of the other snakes, so continuing on him might ultimately reveal the others.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The FBI will make their move when the time is right... but it certainly won&#39;t be before Inauguration.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I’m not sure the FBI should be trusted w/anything really.  That said, I do hope you’re right and something gets done…and if they are going to do something, it would make sense to wait until after inauguration.</p>

<p>I’m just not so sure since some of the elite are <em>in</em> the FBI and the DOJ, so I don’t know how much they’ll go after members in their own ranks.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s definitely a possibility.  That seems certain.  I just wouldn&#39;t be as quick to rush to conclusions as you seem to be since there is so much circumstantial evidence against Alefantis showing that he might indeed be involved in some extremely criminal activity.</p>
