        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p><a href="http://scholarscompass.vcu.edu/etd/4342/">http://scholarscompass.vcu.edu/etd/4342/</a></p>

<p>the introduction alone was enough to pique my interest:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>All organisms function according to a biological rhythm, usually circadian, from the subcellular level through the organismal level (130). These rhythms generally become increasingly disrupted with age. Recently, scientific debate has speculated that these disruptions of rhythm may be the result of ageing. They could also be a significant contributor to ageing. With the discovery of melatonin as the hormone directly related to these rhythms, the query whether these disturbances are causing ageing or are the result of ageing has received increasing interest. This study is less concerned with preventing ageing and more interested in melatonin&#39;s ability to maintain a more youthful homeostasis with increasing age through supplementation, possibly via maintaining hormone and system balance, possibly via maintaining youthful hormonal concentrations and homeostasis. Indirectly, this supplementation may affect the longevity of an organism by retaining the environmental plasticity seen in youth. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>the pineal gland as we age:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Humans, one of the most evolutionarily advanced species on the planet, have developed many uses for the consistency of melatonin secretion. Melatonin is found throughout the body and has access everywhere. Melatonin is mainly produced in the pineal gland, but also in the retina and GI tract. Two other consistencies in human melatonin production are the calcification of the pineal gland with age and the steady decline of melatonin production with age after reproductive viability has expired. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>when the pineal gland is at its peak:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>As an organism ages, a peak of melatonin production is seen prior to puberty and gradually declines until death. The initial decline in melatonin plasma concentration is due to the expansion of the vascular system with increased organism size. This decline initiates puberty through melatonin&#39;s decreased inhibition of the endocrine system, specifically gonadotropins and androgens. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>properties of melatonin:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Melatonin is intimately involved in the regulation of the immune and reproductive systems. It fights cancer, facilitates pregnancy and creates a hormonal homeostasis. Yet, melatonin&#39;s evolutionary value may result from one necessity for survival of every organism, protecting the DNA from free radical damage. </p>

<p>Decrease in melatonin synthesis may also be due to altered physiology in the brain causing a disruption in yearly circadian rhythm, rather than daily circadian rhythm. As melatonin is produced at night, melatonin production increases during winter months with the shortest photoperiod. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>melatonin across species on this planet:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Melatonin has been found in almost every species in the animal kingdom. Melatonin was originally thought to be exclusively produced by the pineal gland. With the discovery of melatonin production in unicellular organisms, e.g., the dinofagellate Gonyaulax polyedra, it was realized that melatonin is also produced by other cells than pinealocytes. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>melatonin and cancer:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>As these results are more significant regarding the prevention of cancer, rather than the treatment, another experiment was designed to determine melatonin&#39;s protection of DNA at physiological concentrations (126). Safrole was injected into rats during the day (low plasma concentrations of melatonin) and at night (peak plasma concentrations of melatonin) Safrole damage to DNA was reduced by over 20% when injected at night, when compared to day injections. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>evolution:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The pineal gland does not appear crucial to the prevention of free radical damage or circadian rhythm in all species. Humans may have evolved a pineal gland as our systems became more complex. The pineal gland, devoted exclusively to melatonin production, may allow a more precise production and feedback of melatonin. This refinement of the use of melatonin may have allowed for another use. Melatonin may be the protector of DNA, allowing humans to reach reproductive maturity and increase the statistical chance of reproduction in such a complicated organism. The pineal gland begins to calcify and melatonin production diminishes as reproductive potential decreases. Free radical damage, DNA damage, disease and cancer rates increase. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>melatonin regulating other hormones:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The biosynthetic mechanisms to produce gonadotropins and prolactin are unaffected by chronological age. The secretory response is altered with increasing age and relative to decreasing melatonin concentrations. Aged animals exhibit higher concentrations of circulating gonadotropins. The addition of melatonin supplements to the diets of ageing animals restores the concentrations of melatonin to levels exclusively secreted by the pineal gland in youth. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>general disease prevention:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Melatonin increases the antibody response when supplemented after initial exposure to antigens. Regelson provoked an immune response in mice by exposing their immune system to sheep blood, after an initial exposure to produce antibodies (92). Their immune response was increased when melatonin was supplemented for one week after the initial exposure. Regelson raises the question, would melatonin supplements increase the effectiveness of childhood vaccinations? Although possible, this may not be necessary, as melatonin levels are highest prior to puberty. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>more melatonin and cancer:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Melatonin secretion declines with age, but the large decreases of melatonin seen in cancer patients is not related to age. Patients with benign tumors expressed higher melatonin concentrations than patients of the same age with malignant tumors. The stage of a malignant tumor directly influences the depression of melatonin production and secretion.
Melatonin is actively being researched as a drug to slow ageing and return hormone balances to youthful standards. In this respect, melatonin may be able to do more than help treat disease. Melatonin may be a way to prevent disease. The research strongly suggests melatonin&#39;s value may primarily lie in preventing autoimmune diseases associated with age, for example, rheumatoid arthritis (92). </p>

<p>Melatonin also has benefits treating diseases. Cancer has been one of the deadliest diseases in human history. Many resources have been allotted to research treatment of cancer. As cancer is not a foreign invader of the body, it is difficult to prevent or treat. Cancer may be a natural consequence of age. The risk of cancer increases proportionally with age. With lower plasma melatonin levels and a weaker immune system, cancer may find less resistance to its establishment and growth in the body. Melatonin supplements and a strong immune system may lower the incidence of cancer in older people, but cancer will still occur. Melatonin may also help boost the effectiveness of current cancer treatments. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>studying melatonin in humans and other organisms:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Conducting studies to determine if melatonin, supplemented to maintain an in vivo concentration similar to youth, extends average age spans in humans is problematic. Humans have relatively long life spans and the studies tracking individuals for many years are filled with unaccountable variables. 
Therefore, melatonin supplements may increase the average age of humans, but more importantly, melatonin supplements increase the quality of life in aged individuals. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>FDA:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>So why is melatonin not prescribed by geriatricians on a widespread basis? The answer may lie in the fact that this prescription would require an off-label use. Doctors are often reluctant to prescribe drugs in a manner not precisely approved by the FDA, even if the use is supported by studies in multiple medical journals. Furthermore, the media is apt to follow this conservative decision, resulting in a public that is not given additional options, including the knowledge to ask their doctors questions. Obviously, this lack of medical education of the public is changing rapidly. In the near future, maybe taking your daily melatonin dose will be a common occurrence for almost everyone older than forty-five. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>closing paragraph:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The current theory of death through old age is the cumulative damage free radicals exert on the body and DNA Animals consume anti-oxidants from the environment to prevent this damage. They also produce an anti-oxidant, melatonin. Organisms succumb to disease, cancer, viral and bacterial infections. Melatonin maintains a healthy, vibrant immune system. Melatonin links the immune system with the reproductive system. It protects an organism from death until it can produce offspring. The pineal gland and SCN are the biological clocks of the body. Melatonin is their administrator. Each is scheduled around the only time table important to any organism in an evolutionary sense, the reproductive system. Supplementing melatonin could increase the mean age of a population. It will increase the quality of life of the aged. It will prevent many diseases. It is a valuable preventive tool for medicine. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>the pineal gland sure sounds like it has some amazing properties. my biggest fear is that the pineal gland is the literal fountain of youth we&#39;ve heard in folklore. and if you were to find it, at what length would you go to drink from the fountain of youth? and at what length would you go to hide this information from others and hide any possibly heinous actions involved?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Some people have interpreted the Bible stories in terms of meditation and the pineal gland.  I do not want to get into a religious debate here, but for those that are interested:  </p>

<p>He talks about how &quot;the Kingdom of God is within you&quot;, and you reach it through meditation.  The pineal gland is the light discussed in the Bible.  I am not a Christian, but this is the interpretation that makes the most sense to me.  </p>

I&#39;ve also seen studies that suggest long term melatonin supplementation can lead to the body not producing it on its own anymore, just like with any other hormone supplementation.
