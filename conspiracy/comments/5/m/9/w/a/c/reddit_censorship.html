<p>As you can imagine, Prof. Hawking receives many such every day.  He very much regrets that due to the severe limitations he works under, and the enormous number of requests he receives, he is unable to compose a reply to every message, and we do not have the resources to deal with many of the specific scientific enquiries and theories we receive.</p>

<p>Please see the website <a href="http://www.hawking.org.uk">http://www.hawking.org.uk</a> for more 
information about Professor Hawking, his life and his work. </p>

Too bad Blizz took that out, I was about to hack their game
I was soloing raid bosses before you were even born
I got a world boss to about 50% health before I died with warlock tanking
I used my blue blob to avoid all the aoe dmg
and siphoned life to keep it alive
that soul bond was too stronk for blizz
bring back the old expansion and I could show you</p>
