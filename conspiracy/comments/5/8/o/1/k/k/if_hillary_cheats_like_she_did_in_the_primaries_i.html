<p>That&#39;s a big IF.  There are already lawsuits that have shown evidence that Hillery cheated. At the debate, they tried to corner Trump into allowing them to cheat without a challenge. Trump <strong>must</strong> challenge the results and people <strong>must</strong> support him. Or Hillery will be a bigger problem than the appointed Bush Jr. who only started little wars. </p>

<p>you&#39;re either an idiot, or you arent paying attention if you actually think raising taxes on the rich will do anything to help the debt. Hrc spews her stupid fucking nonsense about making the rich pay their &quot;fair share&quot; of taxes cuz fools like you eat that shit up. the top 1% pay aprox. half of the taxes as it is. they can also choose to move away and outsource jobs if the govt tries to bend them over anymore.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>They can leave. And they can also hide more money in accounts safe from taxes because they have the means. Hrc will raise taxes on corporations just like obama closed guantanomo. And lets be real for a moment. &quot;trickle down&quot; economics does work when it means small businesses are taxed less. It allows them to hire more people and pay those people better. If you think that is what has been going on for the past 30 years as you say, then your head is buried in the sand. Hrc wants to push a welfare state. she also wants to abolish borders (podesta emails) how the fuck do you propose thats going to work out?? No soverginity, plus excessive &quot;free money&quot; for people who send remittinces back to their home country, plus more people who dont pay taxes (under-the-table-paid illegals) while consuming an enormous amount of tax revenue (public school, food stamps, ER visits that they never intend to pay for) is all an equation for a fucked economy and a non existant middle class.</p>

<p>Don&#39;t argue at all if you are going to <em>explicitly</em> spread misinformation. </p>

<p>People talk shit on Obama all the time for not being a tough leader, but then when Clinton suggests things that would be in opposition to Russia&#39;s desires, suddenly it&#39;s bad?</p>

<p>If you listened to the debate, what she said about the no fly zone in Syria she wants implemented was actually <em>somewhat</em> reasonable and coherent. She wants that to happen, and wants to accomplish by communicating with Russia and making it know what the US intends to happen in the region.</p>

<p>She did avoid directly answering whether she would allow Russian jets to be fought down upon encroaching into the no fly zone, which I found disconcerting, but everything else she said made her sound, regarding that specific topic, as if she was a reasonable, competent, and tough leader. Trump has repeatedly shown himself to be in favor of Putin and his tactics. Do we need another leader that, among myriad other reasons he is unqualified to lead our military, will practice appeasement of one of the few truly dangerous men in the world?</p>

<li><p>Again, arbitrary. You can&#39;t just say &quot;war crime&quot;. It would be arguably, an act of war. The purpose of the proposed no fly zone is at least ostensibly to protect the individuals on the ground that are not fighters who are by far the biggest victims of the conflict. It&#39;s fair to say there could be ulterior motives to this, of a myriad nature, but I think it&#39;d be asinine to say that the protection of civilians is not also a real motivating factor.</p></li>
<li></li>
</ol>

<blockquote>
<p>If I had the time I can pull apart everything she says to show that it&#39;s clever trickery.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That is very vague, but if I&#39;m understanding you correctly, you are saying a couple things here. One, that literally everything she said is part of some deceitful ploy with sinister motivations. Two, that not one word out of her mouth was what she actually believes, nor would it be something that she will actively try to make happen. Three, that you personally totally see through everything she says somehow. Four, that there is something to be seen through in the first place. </p>

<ol>
<li>If by &quot;if you are referring to Putin&quot; you mean when I said this:</li>
</ol>

<blockquote>
<p>one of the few truly dangerous men in the world?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Then yes, I absolutely mean Putin. Ignoring the man himself and his policies, he is absolutely one of the most dangerous men in the world by nature of the position he holds. That alone is enough to be cautious of the man. The same can be said about Obama surely, but Putin in general, and I think you&#39;d be hard pressed to disagree with this, is much more cavalier with his actions than any presidential contemporary.</p>

<p>The MSM definitely plays up the fear mongering side of conflicts between the US and Russia, but conflict is there nonetheless. I don&#39;t predict escalations of a serious, i.e. nuclear, nature, but it is a possibility with Russia. Which makes the leader of that country <em>dangerous.</em></p>

<p>Also, on a more personally directed note:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If you are referring to Putin, stop listening to MSM propaganda. It&#39;s difficult but try.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Stop acting as if you are the only one clued in.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not to mention if Hillary really goes for broke, and pass Amnesty/TPP then America as we know it is pretty much over. Some don&#39;t get this. There are far more than 20 million illegals here. You pass Amnesty an over night they all get welfare. And they all vote for more of it. That&#39;s why Trump is taking the stance he is taking. The USA is being transformed into just another socialist Latin American state. Which is the next step before they do the full on American Union treatment. It really is do or die time if anyone actually wants to keep the USA as we know it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t think the 2nd amendment is the best path if Trump is denied the presidency. If the electoral college gives it to Hillary then Article 5 is the part of the Constitution we need to fall on. It outlines how to amend the Constitution, and while congress is never going to help us the founding fathers left us with the ability to amend it ourselves. If 3/4ths of the states ratify an amendment it becomes official. If Trump could harness our support into passing amendments to reform our electoral process and clean up corruption I think it would be a way better way to spend our energy than attempting an armed rebellion is.</p>

<p>We need 38 states to get on board with a theoretical election reform amendment. The good news is that 33 states are entirely controlled by Republicans, who unlike those that made it to Washington, still have to answer to the Republican base. And with Trump leading the Republican base and immense preexisting public support for abolishing the electoral college and eliminating first past the post voting I think he really has a good shot of making America great again with or without the presidency.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Lmao yeah I wish I got paid to talk shit about that egomaniac. She&#39;s viewed unfavorable but trump is shown to be viewed even worse. And no, throughout this cycle she hasn&#39;t offended really anyone with her words. She hasn&#39;t had to do any damage control that wasn&#39;t about emails. Meanwhile trump has ostracized women, minorities, non Christians, Christians, the gay community, disabled people, the military, the middle class, the inner city, I mean seriously, who has he not offended? If you honestly can&#39;t see why trump is losing in most every single national poll and even Republicans are acknowledging he&#39;s most likely not going to win then you&#39;re not in touch with reality and the rest of our society. I didn&#39;t say if you&#39;re voting trump btw, I said if you can&#39;t see why. Big difference... also gop controls the voting in something like 35 states so if there was rigging they&#39;d have to be in on it. And if you&#39;re going to rig an election, you don&#39;t make it by 12 percent for obvious reasons. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Will you wake up when Donald Trump concedes and pretends like it&#39;s no big deal?</p>

<p>He&#39;s been practically throwing the election. He&#39;s backstabbed Pence (one of the most conservative forces in the country), he&#39;s got Paul Ryan practically getting Bernie&#39;s campaign kicked off again, and it seems like every time someone says &quot;Well Trump would never say X, he&#39;d lose supporters&quot; - he does it the next day or within the hour on Twitter. </p>

<p>He funded O&#39;Keefe&#39;s latest video - a guy who admits he is a radical leftist who makes videos that get republicans laughed at. </p>

<p>Trump praised Obama and Hillary aaaaall the way up until... what, 4 years ago suddenly changes his tune and becomes a hardcore conservative republican and starts going to Church and boasting about his bible collection?</p>

<p>Donald Trump was a plant. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Notice he couldn&#39;t define socialism.  Because he doesn&#39;t want to say the truth: government has ultimate power. And it&#39;s a roll of the dice if that government is &quot;benevolent&quot; (takes your money at the point of a gun) to put other people&#39;s kids through school and provide other people&#39;s healthcare or if it&#39;s malevolent and takes your money at the point of a gun to enrich itself.  </p>

<p>He cites past iterations of Venezuela as points for socialism &quot;working&quot;. When has Venezuela ever competed with the likes of the United States?  </p>

<p>The humanist report guy talks Sweden and Denmark one of which has highest rates of depression, the other gained enormous wealth BEFORE it turned in the socialist direction -- and both of which practice exactly what I said:  </p>

<p>The government holds a gun to your head and demands the fruits of your labor for the benefit of someone else.  </p>

<p>Height of immorality.  Initiating violence against a peaceful person.  </p>

<p>Fuck socialism.  </p>

<p>There are other better ways to help people get what they want and need.  He admits a free market is part of it.  Freedom is ALL of it my friend.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>These people don&#39;t really know what socialism is. I can tell by your name that you understand that there are many who would die to prevent our country from becoming a socialist state, that is everything we stand against as Americans. My generation thinks socialism is Switzerland or Norway, it is not. My generation doesn&#39;t understand that the more power you give a government, the more they will abuse it and the more they will take. They think that the big enemy is &quot;Big Bad Corporations&quot;, when super corps like Monsanto wouldn&#39;t even exist without government allowing the economic conditions that led to Monsanto cornering the market in the first place. They think if you take power from corporations and give it to government, that you solve the problem, when in reality you make it worse. </p>

If there is reasonable suspicion that the votes have been tampered with, the only way to preserve the democracy is to contest the results. This doesn&#39;t imply that there will not be peace, there will just be a waiting period between the day of the election and when the results have been reviewed to confirm the winner. I really don&#39;t see why everyone is going crazy over this.

Ultimately, it would be spun by the MSM to be an act of violence by a splinter group targeting the President. Which would lead to even more regulations if not outright martial law and disarming of the public.</p>

<p>If you were to do something like that it would have to be MLK level peaceful. With special consideration made to not seem in any way threatening. Furthermore the organizers would have educate participants to identify and successfully deal with agents provocateur as there will be plenty.</p>

<p>Peaceful but firm protest is the key. But to be honest, that won&#39;t work either. The solution to our country&#39;s problems is much more involved than a protest regardless of the size. </p>

<p>Your <em>evidence</em>, is not useful or indicative of the current situation in the US. My own anecdotal evidence tells me that Trump supporters are much more likely to let it be known who they support, and the occurrence of supporters for each candidate varies wildly by region.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>pretty sure he didn&#39;t threaten any violence, but we can be sure that any of the americans protesting will likely have violence used against them by state-sponsored gangs of gun thugs known as &quot;security&quot;/Wackenhut/G4S/etc., just like they always do, from Kent State to OWS to Ferguson to the Pipeline protests.</p>

<p>you take &quot;and more&quot; to mean violence when it could just as easily and more logically mean legal action and other forms of dissent toward the subversive elements of society who are passing the highest offices back and forth between their own wives/sons/donors (which is incidentally what Trump is to Bush and Clinton, donor and longtime family friend, it doesn&#39;t really matter who wins but it sure will be good to see all the trumpers freak out when the vote gets tilted &quot;51/49&quot; by the proprietary IP software in the e-voting machines and then passed off as &#39;the result of a democratic election&#39;.)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Your personal experience of talking to people, unless you&#39;ve asked a specific question and recorded responses, is by definition anecdotal evidence.</p>

<p>From wikipedia:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Anecdotal evidence is evidence from anecdotes, i.e., evidence collected in a casual or informal manner and relying heavily or entirely on personal testimony. When compared to other types of evidence, anecdotal evidence is generally regarded as of limited value to a number of potential weaknesses.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>From the second <a href="http://medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/Anecdotal+evidence:">http://medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/Anecdotal+evidence:</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>anecdotal evidence,</p>

<p><em>n</em> information obtained from personal accounts, examples, and observations. Usually not considered scientifically valid but may indicate areas for further investigation and research.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Your <em>evidence</em>, is not useful or indicative of the current situation in the US. My own anecdotal evidence tells me that Trump supporters are much more likely to let it be known who they support, and the occurrence of supporters for each candidate varies wildly by region.</p>
