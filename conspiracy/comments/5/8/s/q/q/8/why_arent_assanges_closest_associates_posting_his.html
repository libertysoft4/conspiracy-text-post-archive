They&#39;d start an online vigil.   They&#39;d make it clear to the world that something isn’t right on a number of different fronts.   </p>

<p>They&#39;d put the thumbscrews to Ecuador.   They&#39;d plan a trip to the embassy in London and tell the world when it&#39;s going to happen, and record the entire journey on video while giving a day by day account of it all. </p>

If they turned off their site and accounts people might freak out but doing it this way maintains status quo. Release daily but keep the bombshells out. Wikileaks main weakness is the lack of figurehead other than Assange it was probably easy for them to be taken over, the dead man&#39;s switch was the only tricky part to handle.</p>

<p>If not, you would just have to think who would benefit the most from his disappearance. I think it´s safe to say that his focus was on the US in the recent weeks and months. I think it´s also safe to say that namely Hillary Clinton has the most to gain by his disappearance.</p>

<p>Now that in turn does not prove anything, but it is highly likely that someone close to her has acted for her, IF she didn´t initiate this herself. </p>

<p>I am too confused that we don´t hear ANYTHING from him. At this point it´s like he never happened. Thing is, if that continues for a year or so then the public will forget. </p>

<p>I can only hope that wikileaks has grown enough to operate independent from Assange. Just in case. </p>

<p>And Hillary Clinton probably has dirt on many people in Washington. She <em>could</em> have put pressure on someone in the military or an intelligence agency who is able to send out covert operatives.</p>

<p>If the &quot;deadman switch&quot; doesn&#39;t get tripped, then you can assume that Julian Assange is being pressured by &quot;intense negotiations&quot; in order to keep him resetting the countdown. Of course, they might have found out what the reset procedure is, and are resetting the deadman switch themselves, making Assange&#39;s life superfluous.</p>

<p>This could be really bad for Julian Assange. He needs our prayers.</p>
