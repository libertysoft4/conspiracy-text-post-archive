    <div class="md"><p>Isn&#39;t it like multiple people run WikiLeaks and it&#39;s Twitter? If I am not wrong some of them post debate/politic-like posts, while others (probably Julian himself) simply posts links to the newest leaks.</p>

<p>Also I mentioned this in the other post before. Why can&#39;t just someone who lives in London, probably near Ecuadorian embassy, why can&#39;t they just go near the building and try to shout him?</p>

<p>I have heard that Julian has have waved at people before through the window, especially his supporters.</p>

<p>This is literally the easiest method that one could do and I am surprised that noone still haven&#39;t tried it. I doubt that noone from this sub does not live in London....</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I should elaborate on this. </p>

<p>You have to extract and consume your own DMT to temporarily ascend to outer space. Next, you must travel to the center of the milky way and enter the black hole. </p>

<p>Once inside, follow the light to locate the celestial bong.</p>

<p>Here is where it gets tricky...The next step is to clear the entire bong in one toke. However, don&#39;t get cocky, this isn&#39;t anything like the weed on earth and is much more potent than all the kush combined on this planet. </p>

<p>If you succeed, you will ascend to the next dimension and be granted a meeting with our creators where they will answer any 1 question but only 1 question per ascension. </p>

<p>If you fail, you will simply snap out of the DMT trip.</p>

<p>I would recommend practicing with an ancient strain on Earth first.</p>

<p>Even better if you can get your hands on this: <a href="http://news.nationalgeographic.com/2016/10/marijuana-cannabis-pot-weed-burial-shroud-china-ancient-discovery-scythians-turpan-archaeology-botany/">http://news.nationalgeographic.com/2016/10/marijuana-cannabis-pot-weed-burial-shroud-china-ancient-discovery-scythians-turpan-archaeology-botany/</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>If the US pressured Ecuador to cut off his Internet access, would it not make it difficult for Assange to communicate? I find it interesting that once that happened all these concerned users started talking about murder while the DNC and the media began to talk about the authenticity of the emails.</p>

<p>This would not be difficult to orchestrate as all it takes is giving CTR direction for spreading the death rumors and surrogates the direction for hitting talking points that question authenticity. Media follows and hits Russia over and over. Meanwhile, Assange has no access to Internet and there&#39;s no way he leaves his room.</p>

<p>What we are left with is Wikileaks continuing without its face. There&#39;s only doc dumps, the media ignores them, and people worry if they are authentic.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve been seeing this argument. What I fail to see is how Assange being renditioned or worse hurts the credibility and authenticity of the leaks. If anything, him being suddenly whisked away to a blacksite lends the leaks even more. It shows that someone desperately wants him silenced.</p>

<p>The only people who could tamper with the leaks are those who would be the ones behind Assange&#39;s capture. We know of only one government right now that has a vested interest in seeing it done. Therefore, if the leaks were tampered with, it was by the U.S. gov.</p>

<p>I am skeptical of the forthcoming emails, but only such that if they release HRC et al. of culpability, conflict with prior emails, or appear to be altered in anyway.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not to mention, there is absolutely no reason to question the validity of the leaks even if he has been captured.</p>

<p>If Assange has been captured and the wikileaks organization has been overtaken, the leaks will omit information. They would have no good reason to generate falsified emails that could shed light on the matter - get too out of whack with what is already known, people will blow up. Instead, they will omit damning information and the only way we have to show that information has been omitted is by the final count of the emails being anywhere in the neighborhood of the reported total number.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is just too tinfoil for me. We&#39;ve received confirmation from multiple sources that say he is alive. I&#39;m gonna have to be skeptical here. I think this honestly could just be a giant PR stunt by Assange to get attention to the leaks.</p>

<p>The United States government is not dumb enough to kill JA with this level of world attention. That would be more boneheaded than anything in quite some time. The SVR would be on top of that in a hot minute.</p>

<p>If JA is never seen again, HRC has a major problem for her presidency.</p>

<p>Also, why would they evacuate his corpse from London? Just take it to a crematorium or bury it in the country.</p>

<p>If a single email gets shown to be fake in the coming days though I am going to completely change my mind about all of that. I have noticed that the past few days have not been particularly damaging, so maybe you have a point.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What would Joe Schmo do? </p>

<p>Sending an encrypted message to nobody in an attempt to ask for help seems like quite a stretch to me. Would it not seem reasonable, with the work he does, that he is in contact with other people through means other than the twitter account? </p>

<p>Assange seems like an intelligent man. Why wouldn&#39;t he set up something more discrete, like a direct message to a trusted associate or friends? </p>

<p>My point is there are much more effective ways to get the message into the hands of people that can actually take any sort of meaningful action. I am not saying it is not possible. The odds that an intelligent man has put his life into the hands of Joe Schmo&#39;s cryptographic ability and then hope he also arranges some type of assistance seems like a death wish to the point of sounding cartoonish.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hey so there was a video added to a channel named &quot;Economic Development&quot; yesterday. It was titled something like &quot;New BREAKING NEWS Speech from Assange.&quot;</p>

<p>It&#39;s actually a video from like 2012.</p>

<p>Why I think this was done deliberately to deceive is because in the video Assange talks about the break-in by UK police that happened not long after he went into the embassy. It happened on a Wednesday night and he mentions that. READ: <em>It&#39;s not just some random speech he gave, but a very particular speech that mentions a particular set of events which just so happens to coincide with this very recent set of events.</em></p>

<p>Now, this past Wednesday was the last time we have any semblance of verifiable proof that Assange was inside the Embassy.</p>

<p>I will not link this video so that it does not get more plays.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This seems like a stretch TBH. If Assange and/or the person(s) running the Twitter account need help, it&#39;d likely need to be from specific people. A pre-arranged signal seems like it would be more useful in that case (say, &quot;If I every tweet the word &#39;stochastic&#39;...). A vague message like this doesn&#39;t seem valuable unless everyone involved with WikiLeaks (or at least those able to act on such a signal) has been rounded-up or compromised in some way.</p>

<p>I also wonder why Ecuador haven&#39;t said anything (assuming Assange has been removed and/or killed, which is far from confirmed). If they are in on it, simply saying Assange&#39;s asylum status has been revoked due to repeatedly violating their agreement/damaging the functioning of the embassy seems sufficient. If they aren&#39;t, I can&#39;t imagine why they wouldn&#39;t make some noise about the embassy being breached.</p>

<p>That said, there is clearly something going on WikiLeaks, be that due to a major outside influence (i.e. a state actor, probably UK and/or US) or some sort of internal struggle, so maybe the tweets are more significant than I suspect.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There seemed to be intentional spelling errors in wikileaks after the cutting of assange internet. Remember, Assange is a master chess player. These are Anagrams Decoded from the spelling errors:More Information Below:
What I got so far (hint pill) (hill print) (thrill pirn) (hilt pirl) (trip nill) (Thirl Pin) (Illth Pir) (ill rip nth) Means: suggest in secret that this must be accepted. a pile of fingerprints. Reel in with excitement. The handle of a tool or weapon that twist. To refuse or reject a slip, mistake, or error. To penetrate a number assigned to an individual, used to establish identity. islam leader is unprosperous. Forcibly pulled something away in a hostile and unfriendly manner to the utmost degree or extent.
First let me start of with saying assange is a genius. It seems he has created a Contingency plan if wikileaks were compromised. Maybe This was his only way of sending a hidden message. If Plan A didnt work out... I think Wikileaks is possibly compromised but not the actual leaks themselves. I think he has hidden servers programmed to release leaks automatic program. But even if not there seems to be a very weird message that needs to be decoded. Remember never underestimate the establishment with unlimited resources. But also, never underestimate assanges intellect either.
My Theory: 1: Im not saying Wiki leaks is compromised but there seems to be a hidden message in the recent miss spellings. And its way deeper than just &quot;Help Him&quot; 2: Here is a list off all the missing letters or needed letters (it seems the code is only for miss spellings that either A.) Needed to add a letter + or B.) Needed to take away a letter.
Tweet errors by wikileaks
-ma(r)ked (4:45a, 18th)
-pri(n)cipally (6:39a, 18th)
+paedophil(l)ia (9:16a, 18th)
-w(h)opper (11:36a, 20th)
-su(r)prise (3:07p, 20th)
-presum(p)tive (6:19a, 21st)
+support(t)ing (6:41a, 21st)
+recip(i)e (3:15p, 21st)
-intel(l)igence (3:24p, 21st)
+algorith(i)m (6:32p, 21st)
= r n l h r p t i l i
Now I Found Anagrams(unscramble words) using only those letters. Once I found a word. I would delete the letters that I had used in the first unscramble. For example, I got the word HINT out of the letters. So now youre left with RLRPLI. The second word I got is Pill. So ( Hint, Pill) Left with R R (but that is okay because they were (-) letters any way.) Now we decoded meaning from that anagram. Just go look through dictionaries and try to make the most possible sense. This is what I got Hint Pill = Hint:(suggest or indicate something indirectly or covertly. Pill :something repugnant or unpleasant that must be accepted or endured) = (Hint Pill): Suggest in secret that this must be accepted.
4:Decoded meanings: So here&#39;s the tutorial to do this
[Use <a href="http://wordunscrambler.com/">http://wordunscrambler.com/</a> make sure you select dictionary as -largest-.]
[Letters that need to be unscrambled to create 2 words(sometimes more): r n l h r p t i l i] (Letters that are OKAY TO BE NOT USED and left over after getting 2 words: r n h r p l)--because they were the missing letters from the typing errors.
1.)Unscramble a word.
2.)Delete the letters you used in your first word.
3.)Unscramble remaining letters. Get second word. Only get the Second word that makes the most sense and if it does leave out some letters on the second word make sure it only leaves out letters that were marked with a negative (-)
4.)Find a meaning from multiple dictionaries for those 2 words (or more) you get from those letters. Now create a sentence using the meaning from both words. (if you can get more then 2 words out of it thats fine too)
5.)Rinse and Repeat with words you havnt used yet in your unscrambling.
Decoding so far: hill print= Hill :a pile of something. Print a : a mark made by pressure : impression b : something impressed with a print or formed in a mold c : fingerprint so. (hill print) = a pile of fingerprints? Thrill pirn = Thrill :to feel very excited or happy about something Pirn :a weaver&#39;s bobbin, spool, or reel (thrill pirn)= Reel in with excitment hilt pirl= Hilt: 2.the handle of any weapon or tool. Pirl:&quot;to twist, wind&quot; (thread, etc.), (hilt pirl) The handle of a tool or waepon that twist. trip nill= Trip: a slip, mistake, error, or blunder.s. Nill=too refuse or reject. (Trip Nill)= To refuse or reject a slip, mistake, or error. thirl pin= Thirl: Verb:To pierce, perforate, penetrate. Pin : a number assigned to an individual, used to establish identity in order to gain access to a computer system via an automatic teller machine, a point-of-sale terminal, or other device. (Thirl Pin)= To penetrate a number assigned to an individual, used to establish identity. (ill) (rip) (nth)= Ill: adverb 13. in an ill manner. unsatisfactorily; poorly: It ill befits a man to betray old friends. in a hostile or unfriendly manner. Rip: tear or pull (something) quickly or forcibly away from something or someone. nth:a high degree or power. the utmost degree or extent: (ill) (rip) (nth) Meaning decoded: Forcibly pulled something away in a hostile and unfriendly manner to the utmost degree or extent. now put this together so far and (hint pill) (hill print) (thrill pirn) (hilt pirl) (trip nill) (Thirl Pin) (illth pir) (ill rip nth) Means: suggest in secret that this must be accepted. a pile of fingerprints. Reel in with excitement. The handle of a tool or weapon that twist. To refuse or reject a slip, mistake, or error. To penetrate a number assigned to an individual, used to establish identity. islam leader is unprosperous. Forcibly pulled something away in a hostile and unfriendly manner to the utmost degree or extent.
High autism post. Not here to concern troll. Help me do more. THERES STILL MORE TO BE UNSCRAMBLED AND DEFINED. HELP ME DECODE. Tired now but will continue.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The short answer is yes</p>

<p>As of October 26th, 2016 Julian Assange is still alive and well. And Wikileaks are still currently publishing roughly daily new emails and documents at <a href="https://wikileaks.org">https://wikileaks.org</a></p>

<p>On October 26th, 2016 Julian Assange made a live phone call during a computer conference. Listen to his call at <a href="https://youtu.be/6iO8YZLwqlY">https://youtu.be/6iO8YZLwqlY</a> </p>

<p>On October 22nd, 2016 the claim that Assange is still alive comes from a courageous man who went to the embassy on Saturday October 22nd, 2016 and asked about Julian Assange. When that man walked out of the Ecuadorian Embassy in London where Julian Assange has political asylum, Steven Alves asked that man if Julian was still alive? The man replied that Julian Assange is &quot;ok&quot;. Watch Steven Alves&#39; video at <a href="https://youtu.be/fKdKpfg_QyU">https://youtu.be/fKdKpfg_QyU</a> </p>

<p>Steven&#39;s longer video at <a href="https://youtu.be/bHFpXAypqpg">https://youtu.be/bHFpXAypqpg</a>  </p>

<p>Alternative link to Steven&#39;s video at <a href="https://youtu.be/HZ4QlgvhZuM">https://youtu.be/HZ4QlgvhZuM</a> </p>

<p>On Friday October 21, 2016 WikiLeaks made the following statement on their official Twitter account: 
&quot;WikiLeaks ‏@wikileaks  Oct 21
Mr. Assange is still alive and WikiLeaks is still publishing.&quot;</p>

<p>That is a hefty affirmation to make without unique visual confirmation.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, it&#39;s all potentially fabricated until irrefutable evidence emerges proving that he&#39;s still alive.</p>

<p>Never be surprised what the average person is willing to do when threatened with torture.</p>

<p>The word of proximate individuals is not enough, given the escalation of uncertainty.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know how you extract the letter &#39;E&#39; from the misspelled &#39;recipe&#39; (it says recipie). The letter &#39;I&#39; is the letter being misspelled. So if you would use this logic, it actually reads &#39;hilp him&#39;.</p>

<p>Also, the way you resolved &#39;him&#39; doesn&#39;t doesn&#39;t fit with the other system. In that system, the letter &#39;I&#39; would again be the missing letter. So it would said &#39;hilpi&#39;. Which means nothing.</p>

<p>This is probably the weakest theory I&#39;ve seen here in the last few days. Reaching on a whole new level.</p>

<p>It&#39;s probably just some other person running it who is bad at english.</p>

<p>It doesn&#39;t really but nice try. There&#39;s no doubt however that Assange is in danger. That was obvious since the rape charges.</p>
