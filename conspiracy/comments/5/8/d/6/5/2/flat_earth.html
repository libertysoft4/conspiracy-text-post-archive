I have a few questions that I haven&#39;t been able to find a solid answer for. Trolls are welcome to the discussion but I&#39;m currently doing research for a project so if you would be so kind as to only join the thread if you wish to contribute to the conversation. (Although, the &quot;theory&quot; does seem quite delusional and asking for cooperation seems ironic.) Both sides of the argument are absolutely welcome. Any further information provided will also be appreciated.
1) What exactly is at the end of the ice shelf? And what does it lead to?
2) What is at the North Pole?
3) Explain why sundown is 2 minutes later at the top of the Burj Khalifa than it is at the base?
4) Are there any notable academics, scientists, or leaders who believe in the Flat- Earth model?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Global warming is happening, the data shows that. The real question is whether it&#39;s part of the natural cooling/warming cycle of the planet, or whether it&#39;s being accelerated by human activity.</p>

<p>The conspiracy is that we&#39;re being told that all scientists agree it&#39;s man made, which is not the case. So the debate is being suppressed in order to promote a &quot;you&#39;re bad humans, and you should feel bad and pay more taxes for your sins&quot; type of message.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Questioning what you&#39;re told to believe in the absence of first hand evidence is smart, even if your alternate theories are wrong, so while i don&#39;t believe the earth is flat, it&#39;s not stupid to run the idea through a course of mental checks. </p>

<p>It&#39;s not stupid to question Anything you haven&#39;t seen for yourself. That said, there are some things i actually can observe for myself about the probable shape of the earth. Among those is that looking around i see that nature favours a sphere. The shape of the moon, sun and stars also lead me to the conclusion that the earth follows suit.</p>

<p>The bible, incidentally, also alludes to a sphere, not a flat plane.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Full disclosure: I&#39;m a &quot;globbie&quot;.</p>

<p>The &quot;Flat Earth&quot; umbrella actually covers quite a few models. I&#39;ll enumerate all of them for clarity:</p>

<ul>
<li>Globe/Heliocentric (i.e. &quot;main-stream science&quot;)</li>
<li>Convex Earth/Skycentric</li>
<li>Concave Earth/Hollow Earth</li>
<li>Flat Earth/Bible Firmaments</li>
</ul>

<p>Your questions (1) and (2) are in reference to the Hollow Earth model, where we find some advanced civilization inside the Earth, and the passage to it is on the North Pole. The Nazis supposedly hid there as well after the fall of Berlin.</p>

<p>Your question (3) is due to either bending of light rays or perspective horizon effect, depending on your model.</p>

<p>For you last question (4), there are no notable academic, scientists, or <strong>surveyors</strong> who believe in anything other than the Globe model. The evidence is overwhelming, and you can measure it yourself at home, using home-made instruments. There is also a whole field of academic study dedicated to the shape and size of the Earth, it is called geodesy.</p>

<p>I believe the current Flat Earth frenzy is due to the general populace finally waking up to the fact that Main Stream Media is, and has been, lying to us. Then, logically, why wouldn&#39;t Main Stream Science lie to us? Actually, they&#39;re partly right: NASA does lie to us about many things.</p>

<p>However, our Earth is objectively, scientifically, an oblate spheroid. At least on this point, Main Stream Science (NASA) is correct.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What I thought, was that the original flat-earth society was debate group/joke.  They were people online who would practice arguing the (at the time) very silly point that the earth was flat, in order to simply brush up on their debating abilities.  Now, at some point in the last 10 years people started taking the forum as serious?  I&#39;m not totally sure when that happened but it seems a bit silly to see this one pop up on here, at least to me.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ll write my opinion here.</p>

<p>1) more land maybe people are living on the land in advanced civilizations.</p>

<p>2) who knows rumor has it that it&#39;s a massive piece of magnetite maybe I forget, and it&#39;s charged with some sort of electricity to create the downward force. Could just be that and it&#39;s buried underground or maybe there are people there.</p>

<p>3) You see the sun for 2 minutes longer because the sun is just going out of view when you&#39;re on the ground. Since you have more height you can see a bit farther, for that reason it sets 2 minutes later. </p>

<p>4) b.o.b. believes in it. Here&#39;s a video of flat earth in music. If you youtube you can find people who are very intelligent who are flat earthers. Engineers and stuff. Once you see the holes you can&#39;t go back lol. Before then I think you&#39;re blinded by yourself.</p>
