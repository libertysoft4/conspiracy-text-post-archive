        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>He is in line with the Zionist agenda, his AIPAC speech shows he is fully compliant. Thus he will go to war in Syria. From his AIPAC speech:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>My number-one priority is to dismantle the disastrous deal with Iran. ... </p>

<p>The biggest concern with the deal is not necessarily that Iran is going to violate it because already, you know, as you know, it has, the bigger problem is that they can keep the terms and still get the bomb by simply running out the clock. ... </p>

<p>When I’m president, I will adopt a strategy that focuses on three things when it comes to Iran. First, we will stand up to Iran’s aggressive push to destabilize and dominate the region. ... </p>

<p>Iran is a problem in Iraq, a problem in Syria, a problem in Lebanon, a problem in Yemen and will be a very, very major problem for Saudi Arabia. ... </p>

<p>When I’m president, believe me, I will veto any attempt by the U.N. to impose its will on the Jewish state. It will be vetoed 100 percent. ... </p>

<p>When I become president, the days of treating Israel like a second-class citizen will end on day one. ... </p>

<p>We will move the American embassy to the eternal capital of the Jewish people, Jerusalem. ... </p>

<p>The Palestinians must come to the table knowing that the bond between the United States and Israel is absolutely, totally unbreakable. </p>

<p>He&#39;s a total Zionist sellout, and a warmonger, and WILL attack Syria if it is massively profitable for him. Which is easy to do since the Rothschilds Zionists possess legal money-creation abilities through the central banks. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think his choice of VP is pretty telling as well. Pence supported the Patriot Act, supports TPP, supported military action against Iraq, supports Israel and its &quot;right&quot; to attack facilities in Iran to prevent the Iranians from developing nuclear weapons and also defended the actions of Israel in its use of deadly force in enforcing the blockade of Gaza. Oh and the guy says his role model as Vice President would be Dick Cheney. If Trump somehow won the election, Pence would be the one holding the leash.</p>

<p>Zionism is the ultimate belief in a Jewish homeland, in which she agrees with (This goes against the language of Judaism - Hebrews - no homeland until the messiah comes). She&#39;s a &quot;Jew&quot; (Eastern European). Just because you are ignorant does not make it so. You&#39;re a joke bro, and if you want to debate me, you&#39;re going to need to learn up.

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s historical Zionism. Israel already exists. I&#39;m talking modern political Zionism, as the term is used today. </p>

<p>The argument now is should Israel be allowed to expand to take over more land, or not. I say not. Stein says not. Trump and Clinton both support Israel&#39;s expansion.</p>

<p>Therefore Stein is not an Israeli expansionist, and therefore is not a Zionist as I&#39;m using the word here. Sorry if we were not using similar language at the start, my fault. </p>

Israeli expansionism is the driving problem of that conflict: <a href="http://www.a-w-i-p.com/media/blogs/articles/10/1/A/PAL_ZIO_israel-palestine_map_loss_of_land_70.jpg?mtime=1358416934">http://www.a-w-i-p.com/media/blogs/articles/10/1/A/PAL_ZIO_israel-palestine_map_loss_of_land_70.jpg?mtime=1358416934</a></p>

<p>If someone attacks you, report their comment and follow up on the report with a message to the mods requesting action. </p>

<p>We will remove the attack, and that way you get to maintain the high ground by not getting in the muck with other users, lowering the level of discourse on the sub. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Fair enough. But is it not accurate? He repeatedly does this type of behavior, over months. I will keep simply flagging it when I see it, I guess, but it seems like mods should take control of this sub for the users benefit instead of letting thread-derailers, forum sliders, and provocateurs run the threads, but I guess that&#39;s none of my business.

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m quoting the man. It&#39;s his own opinion. The belief that Israel should have Mount Zion is the core of Zionism.

<p>He&#39;s a Zionist. This is proof. </p>
