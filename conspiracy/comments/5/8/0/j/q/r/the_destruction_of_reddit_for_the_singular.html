<p>We all know that you need to be careful with what people post and whether something is real or made up.</p>

<p>But just like people losing whatever faith they had left, in the MSM, subreddits like <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a> will probably never ever be the same, after this election cycle.</p>

<p>Its good to see this subreddits is holding strong against whatever persuasion might someone be trying to use on the users or mods. Everyone... Just keep up the fight. Keep doing our research and posting the truth.</p>

<p>But most importantly, keep talking and keeping honest conversations going in the comments section. That&#39;s what makes this place so special and make it someplace that users like myself keep enjoying to return to.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I do agree, the president is largely symbolic. Then again, modern life (our culture) is largely more symbolic than anything else. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t even mean any grand or nefarious scheme - I don&#39;t think many people would argue that the public interaction with the system in any large sense guides realpolitik. </p>

<p>Pick any subject, our political discourse on it is largely childish and symbolic, if it&#39;s even acknowledged at all. </p>

<p>We all know this, and in that sense by going along with it have agreed to go along with it, participating in symbolic rituals with the details to be hammered out by the people who will be there regardless. </p>

<p>It&#39;s a bit silly, but in that sense the presidential election has become more important than ever. Your life largely won&#39;t change, but the symbols create the narrative you live in. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think my life and all of ours is getting ready for a huge change. Not sure yet what it is, but I know what must be done. I have common sense and can understand clearly what is right and what is wrong. The USA can be better than most of us believe. I&#39;m tired of all the taxes, interests, and laws that keep my interest. I&#39;m sick that I actually work and part of what I am paid is going to a system that jails people who smoke weed. Meanwhile cigarettes are sold everyday and alcoholics are abound. Kids overdosing off of drugs made by Pfizer.</p>

<p>That I have to buy fuel for my car or charge the batteries in my phone, pay for electricity and pay for water that&#39;s poisoned. When clearly I know there is more energy in the space around me and that technology created to tap that energy is held from me. I&#39;m tired of being told if u are acting this way u need to take this medication. Sure, you know cause the pharmaceutical industry is so big on solving my health problems you know if everyone was healthy they would be making no money. </p>

<p>Tired of being told that some things are just impossible and sometimes the odds are too far against you. That go to college and get an education is your best bet. Shit. I can get an education on the Internet I do all the time. Why don&#39;t you invest in a 401k? Or why do u rent not buy? Why why why aren&#39;t you saving money? Why are you living like a person who has no ambitions. I have no ambitions that exist in this monopoly money pyramid scheme</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It seems like the mistake they made was thinking reddit was just another big social media network. I think a reasonable portion of people who come to reddit do so because they don&#39;t want TV, facebook or twitter. I think we&#39;re the one&#39;s least likely to believe or put up with propaganda or conform to the tune of engineered social norms. Every penny they have spent on CTR has been wasted, worse it has probably backfired because all they have done is start a war. I bet we&#39;ll probably see more people like Julian Assange and Snowden pop up in the future because of this.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree with everyone saying that this has gone beyond Hillary and the presidency, but I will say as a Bernie supporter and progressive, this is part of Hillary&#39;s MO. Scorched earth campaigning, including online, that has been very destructive to online progressive communities and leaves people who saw each other as friends or at least allies at each other&#39;s throats. I left a community I&#39;d been part of since 2008 when it became completely intolerant of Bernie supporters. Either you were with Hillary or you were subjected to a lot of garbage. Now she&#39;s in the general election so general political communities are next on her list to use, abuse, and destroy without remorse. </p>

<p>I&#39;m glad though that there are people who are still fighting. </p>

<p>And the exact time Reddit was falling, is &quot;Gamergate&quot; of 2014 which i believe is a test attempt by intelligence to see how easy is it to censor the internet. They succeeded and the SJWs censored 80% of the internet before the Hillary minions even did their job.</p>

Essentially this is significant because after the start of the election, Podesta, part of HRC&#39;s cpaign, isn&#39;t supposed to be coordinating with these groups. Unfortunately, the FEC is totally hamstrung according to its own commissioners.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is larger than Crooked Hillary.</p>

<p>This is truly the creation of the Ministry of Truth.  The media is no longer hiding it.  They have a state agenda to push, and they are pushing it.  The sad part is most people still consider &quot;the media&quot; the source of all information, and anything not reported by &quot;the media&quot; is in the land of conspiracy theory.</p>

<p>When CNN told its viewers it was illegal to read Wikileaks and just let them read them for the people, that was the final nail in the coffin.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think what is the most depressing about the whole thing is how marginalised various forms of thought have become to the extent they have been corralled in a &quot;conspiracy&quot; forum.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not talking the more fringe or wacky topics you see from time to time. What I&#39;m talking about are here is what 10 - 20 years ago would have been regarded as is completely rational political discussion. Then you have stories that are 100% verifiable, all shunted into this marginalised side line because they are inconvenient truths.</p>

<p>The real truth is that the majority of real discussion and research in this sub is not the stuff of some fringe lunatics but real and well done research. Here in fact is one of the only places one here you won&#39;t be destroyed for going against popular opinion. And it&#39;s lets face it that in many cases it is just the weight of mainstream opinion crushing anything else underfoot whether you can prove it or argue it ceases to matter very much in that situation. </p>

<p>Without question the larger news and politics subs have been subverted by outside interest. I think this is also a site wide phenomenon. What you need to remember is that the vast majority of interactions you will have won&#39;t be with shills. Sure that&#39;s part of the current climate but in reality it&#39;s worse than that. The bottom line is that public opinion has been subverted to the extent that it has become co-oped and the vast majority of hostility you will encounter will be in the form of a self policing communities. </p>

<p>Why I and I think many other users keep coming back here is because you can actually have voice that would otherwise be screamed down by the latest rhetoric in more mainstream subs.</p>
