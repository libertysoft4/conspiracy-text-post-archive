    <div class="md"><p>Well it&#39;s pretty easy. There&#39;s shills and there&#39;s really low intelligence people that in effect act as controlled shills.  To stop them don&#39;t engage them, they turn arguments away from logic, information and investigation to rhetorical arguments.</p>

<p>Study rhetoric and linguistics and you&#39;ll figure out very quickly who you can trust because the shills speak in a diametrically opposite dialect.</p>

<p>Essentially rhetoric is discussing everything but the actual prepositions and points and directing attention away from the facts. It&#39;s super easy to pick out. Spreading disinformation with sprinklings of truth is infinitely harder than simply deflecting with rhetorical and semantic attacks to persuade the others viewing/listening.</p>

<p>They may start with disinfo but will devolve to rhetoric very quickly if you start to discuss things. You&#39;ll get venomous reactions that are not fitting to what you said because a person speaking logically is cognitive dissonance to them.</p>

<p>They operate on the most basic human instinct, joining the winning team. In effect they don&#39;t think about the truth or anything other than the fact they think their rhetoric gains them acceptance by the winning side, if you refuse to engage with them they will stop feeling like they are on the winning team.</p>

<p>This is my sister, sadly. Bought two of Hillary&#39;s books (she&#39;ll never read them, just likes to have them laying around in case someone comes over and sees them), donated to the DNC and Shillary&#39;s campaign, watches MSM nightly and cusses at the TV when Trump is speaking. So she gets to tell her friends she is politically active. Well, she is, if you consider what is happening politics. I call it mass fraud. Smoke and mirrors. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ok so how to deal with it. Don&#39;t engage don&#39;t try to argue but allow her to unleash, when she goes into activation mode if you stand within her comfort zone and allow her to unload eventually what happens is the person begins to unravel, say nothing and listen intently with zero reaction.</p>

<p>If you do nothing and allow her nonsense to spew out eventually their mind recognizes at a very deep level that they are harming their own credibility . If you give them nothing to feed on their reality unfolds because it is the reactions that drive them. Simply standing in their vicinity while they unleash causes them to see the heir of their ways because they aren&#39;t getting feedback that enforces their beliefs. It causes an inception, every belief they have is founded on people being a certain way and when an exception shatters that reality the whole thing begins to unravel.</p>

<p>This only works on an individual level when they don&#39;t have a group to gang up on you. It won&#39;t stick immediately but it plants the doubt in their mind. Say literally nothing and just walk away, fight the urge to react. Their mind will try to scrape together the rhetoric but when you don&#39;t give them words to spin their rhetoric factory crashes.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Very true. We&#39;ve made an effort in our neighborhood since we moved in to know our neighbors as well as employees and owners of local businesses. I don&#39;t think people do this enough anymore, and it&#39;s served us well. Dogs got out?  Neighbor put them back in the yard.

    <div class="md"><p>There&#39;s time I&#39;m thankful I live in the south. Sure we catch a lot of hell (Florida Man!) but the county I&#39;m in is deeply conservative. Mostly in the way we believe we can do things for ourselves and don&#39;t need the gov&#39;t to step in. After a hurricane it&#39;s the locals that have cleared the roads, made runs out of state to get essentials and helped the neighbors...usually days before FEMA even shows up.</p>

<p>Don&#39;t get me wrong. We are not country folk. It&#39;s just we grew up learning how to be self sufficient and we all have each others backs.</p>

<p>Machete... block parties are the shit! I grew up with those. Shut down the whole street and everyone brings food and drink and just parties for a whole weekend. You get to know your neighbor, their wife and kids and you end up realizing for the most part they are no different than you. You&#39;d be surprised how political differences disappear after vast quantities of food and drink.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I live on the US/Mexico border. We&#39;re fairly self-sufficient down here but I think spending time with your neighbors has become long forgotten in most parts of the world. One of our neighbors is in her eighties and talks all the time about how people used to be more neighborly. I think that just as the Internet has made us more connected, it has also made us more isolated. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Why dont we try organise through this sub, the last bastion of internet researchers, and make a new site?</p>

<p>Something like instead of a site that everyone can create subs... just a site called r/politics.com? Lets take it back, create a site that&#39;s essentially a chan or reddit sub but just for Politics and research on the powers that be?</p>

<p>Surely if we all jumped ship and started teaming up with drudge, wikileaks, veritas etc...</p>

<p>There is so much info out there we need a serious board now!</p>

<p>We must be able to do something????????????? We need to atleast attempt to organise weekly community sessions... vote on a topic to research and go from there?</p>

<p>They have scattered us by design... we need to regroup before its too late?!?!?!</p>

<p>Nah. Friend, I&#39;ll glide and trust there are genius children! Peaceful strangers and my heavy anchor.</p>

<p>Aaron Schwartz wanted to open up knowledge to the masses in a very good way. His family must miss him so deeply. I know I do. </p>
