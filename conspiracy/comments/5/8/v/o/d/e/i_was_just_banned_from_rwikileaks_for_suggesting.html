<p>With all the rumors of wikileaks being compromised, I&#39;m fairly certain <a href="/r/wikileaks">/r/wikileaks</a> is compromised. That being said, I know for a fact Assange had rock solid contingencies in place. Keep an eye out and be wary of what you read. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>We can always open a new subreddit. </p>

<p>But then again CTR has probably already realized the real way to control is just to pay off the reddit admins who have full power over the site. It&#39;s pennies to presidential campaign to give some of the reddit staff a few million each for their assistance. Get them turn over control of a mod account in every sub they want to compromise and then have that mod kick everyone else out, bring on a few friendly accounts and quit &quot;in embarrassment&quot;. Everyone will assume the guy just went rouge and the new mods will say they don&#39;t need the old ones to run the shop. Hell the admin could simply ban and delete the accounts of old mods if they wanted to.</p>

<p>At some point reddit will no longer be a viable option as a place for us to discuss this stuff. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thank you! Looks like bitcoins are classified as property rather than currency.  Yet are taxable as currency when it is used as compensation. Interesting. :) </p>

<p>From irs.gov:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>IRS Virtual Currency Guidance : Virtual Currency Is Treated as Property for U.S. Federal Tax Purposes; General Rules for Property Transactions Apply</strong><br/>
&quot;In some environments, virtual currency operates like “real” currency -- i.e., the coin and paper money of the United States or of any other country that is designated as legal tender, circulates, and is customarily used and accepted as a medium of exchange in the country of issuance -- but it does not have legal tender status in any jurisdiction.
The notice provides that virtual currency is treated as property for U.S. federal tax purposes.  General tax principles that apply to property transactions apply to transactions using virtual currency.  Among other things, this means that:
Wages paid to employees using virtual currency are taxable to the employee, must be reported by an employer on a Form W-2, and are subject to federal income tax withholding and payroll taxes.
Payments using virtual currency made to independent contractors and other service providers are taxable and self-employment tax rules generally apply.  Normally, payers must issue Form 1099.
The character of gain or loss from the sale or exchange of virtual currency depends on whether the virtual currency is a capital asset in the hands of the taxpayer.
A payment made using virtual currency is subject to information reporting to the same extent as any other payment made in property.&quot;  <a href="https://www.irs.gov/uac/newsroom/irs-virtual-currency-guidance">https://www.irs.gov/uac/newsroom/irs-virtual-currency-guidance</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s funny just yesterday there was someone saying we should buy reddit gold to support reddit, here on this sub, when just weeks ago another said never buy reddit gold because they pull this shit, which I agree with, now (didn&#39;t before.  as you can see I&#39;m a gilding heavyweight but i&#39;ve given my last gold because of their censorship, i agree with the latter sentiment....)</p>

<p>Yet this comment about &#39;buy gold&#39; was greatly upvoted.  It reminded me of those commercials and those &#39;financial &quot;Fear&quot; blogs&#39; that always have ron paul clip telling you doom is near (every year since 2008 that clip has been going around)...and so he tells you to buy gold, etc</p>

<p>&quot;Buy gold&quot;, to me means: sell gold.  If someone says, it&#39;s a bad market for gold, that means &quot;buy gold&quot;.  You see you can&#39;t trust these bastards to tell you the truth, so you negate everything they tell you.  The people who own the gold are trying to sell you gold, that means the price of gold is slumped.  Similarly those fianncial shows tell you which stocks to buy are getting insider info from the companies themselves....why on earth would you not make your own financial advice and instead listen to someone who is paying someone to tell you to do something!?</p>

<p>Of course,  I started out talking about reddit gold.  </p>

<p>My point is, I think conspiracy and all of reddit really IS compromised.  I see people here I don&#39;t recognize.  Some are just people coming out of the woodwork and joining us here, which I appreciate.  But so many more are these new accounts with low karma or old accounts with low karma and with past comments pushing an agenda.</p>

<p>I can&#39;t take it anymore</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Everyday is a good day to buy gold [Au not Reddit gold], even at the peak as it is worth more than paper promises.</p>

<p>I consider the occasional posts that run counter to the general vibe of this sub to be like commercial breaks, convenient times to get up and get other things done while the people who spent the time and money to produce them get no return on investment (analogy breaks down when you note that I don&#39;t watch TV, and the optional purchase of PVR units for your own <a href="http://www.menshealth.com/health/never-hold-in-pee">well being</a>).</p>

<p>I&#39;ve been gilded twice on Reddit, once being after I told people NOT to do so, and never gilded anyone because I felt that it was a poor return on investment as a recipient of gold. Not that I did not appreciate the gesture for the acknowledgement of my posts, but I&#39;d rather open another Bitcoin address and accumulate the tips for ounces of golds cousin metal: silver.</p>

<p>Reddit Inc/Conde Naste can get by without the few extra cups of coffee at Starbucks and I&#39;m sure the few PM dealers that take crypto for metal would, and have previously, appreciate my business.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes.  1) We get everyone to flip the mechanics around and downvote when you mean to upvote.  So instead of upvoting you downvote when you like something.</p>

<p>so then tourists will read the upvoted stuff and then the incumbents / residents will read the downvoted stuff.  And we can ignore their prattle.</p>

<p>It will also hide the downvoted stuff so it will be able to &#39;hide&#39; there.</p>

<p>Yes it will be difficult to distinguish from the legitimate downvoted stuff by tourists and the downvote likes...you&#39;ll just have to use your judgment, or just downvote it harder. Stuff that&#39;s downvoted the hardest will be upvoted the most.</p>

<p>This will effectively keep these shills at bay because if they upvote you to positive then your comment will have visibility, which they don&#39;t want.  They are then forced to leave your junk alone or upvote you to &#39;1&#39;.  So you should read the 1&#39;s and the 0s also.</p>

<p>Chances are though, tourists will take the bait because they&#39;re dumb anyway and it will let real people just ignore the top stuff.</p>

<p>2) Also, people shouldn&#39;t reply, they should only make top level comments and then reference other people&#39;s comments in the top level comments, thereby &#39;flattening out&#39; the threadedness...you can reference by quoting someone or by permalink...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Assuming that this isn&#39;t actually a CTR takeover (which we all know they are definitely trying to do), you might have been banned because you were mistaken for a &quot;concern troll&quot; trying to split up the userbase. I know CTR has been trying to do that a lot recently, and has been making it a lot harder for mods to deal with. Granted, the best way for them to handle it would probably to just keep mod-actions transparent and keep in communication with the users. I would suggest trying to contact the mods in modmail about all this to try to clear things up. Mods do make mistakes with bans, and the best way to resolve it is to try contacting them directly. Try to give them the benefit of the doubt, but still make an effort to verify what exactly is going on. Be polite with them and try to see it from their side. If they don&#39;t reciprocate, then they are probably compromised.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The sub was Reddit requested 5 years ago by what seems to be an seo spammer who had no idea how to view the modqueue or modmail.  His later comments indicate he is extremely anti trump.  Somebody probably PMd him and requested he add more mods, who surprise surprise are antitrump. </p>

<p>I honestly think the guy who RR long ago is just an inexperienced seo spammer and he the people who requested they be added aren&#39;t helpful and remove comments and bad to prevent large threads about their moderation skill incompetence getting out of control.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t think it got compromised with people from the campaign, I just think generally speaking, they are not very skilled and aren&#39;t good at accepting criticism and don&#39;t understand how/why being transparent is important.</p>
