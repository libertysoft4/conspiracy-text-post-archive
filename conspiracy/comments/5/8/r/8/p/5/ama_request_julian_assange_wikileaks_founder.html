    <div class="md"><p>My point exactly!
With the added bonus of being able to have some questions answered.</p>

<p><em>If you don&#39;t ask (AMA request) you don&#39;t get!</em></p>

<p>Edit: Good points raised so far:</p>

<p><strong>His lack of a known internet connection</strong> is a very valid point and something I thought of prior to posting however you can&#39;t tell me that, in this day and age, he wouldn&#39;t be able to obtain one.</p>

<p>Regarding the actual AMA, I have complete <strong>faith in the Moderators/Admins of r/conspiracy</strong>. It&#39;s their time to shine.</p>

<p><strong>I posted this to, at the very least, draw attention to the fact that there is no <em>rock solid</em> proof that he is alive</strong> and well during a [crucial] time where they are actively attempting to <em>silence</em> him.</p>

<p>As a community, we can dissect all the (mis)information for as long as we like but hearing from Julian Assange is the only way to know that;</p>

<ul>
<li><p>he is indeed alive and well</p></li>
<li><p>Wikileaks has not been compromised</p></li>
<li><p>what has become a <em>movement</em> has not just been nullified</p></li>

    <div class="md"><p>Fuck I hope he is ok. The last 3 days has been a fucking shit-show.</p>

<p>I asked this in another thread but do you remember the call made to the Ecuadorian Embassy when the internet was cut, asking about Assange?</p>

<p>Or the photo&#39;s that I can no longer find of someone being escorted from the Embassy in a black hood and put into a van?</p>

<p>Or the details about the 1:01 post dated 1/1/1986 (possible room 101 reference?)?</p>

<p>So much shit to sift through I can no longer find them. Hoping for a peaceful resolve to this situation though. Jules is a true Aussie hero.</p>
