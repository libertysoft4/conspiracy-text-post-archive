        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>This company, the Benenson Strategy Group, advises everyone from large companies to political figures on strategies to boost public approval, win over hearts and minds, have successful product launches, etc.</p>

<p>They claim to have played a role in getting Obama elected. And one of their current clients includes H. Clinton&#39;s presidential campaign.</p>

<p>I found their company after running across <a href="http://media.wix.com/ugd/0cf371_514bfe6a2dec4871ab7da7d50b9be410.pdf">this weird document</a> that appears to be neatly assembled by them. However, I cannot confirm whether or not this document is a well-done forgery <em>(I&#39;ve never seen any of their other documents).</em></p>

<p>I found the document on another &quot;news&quot; website of pretty questionable reliability which claims it was leaked by <em>&quot;A source inside the Clinton campaign...&quot;</em></p>

<p>In a nutshell, this &quot;leaked&quot; document lays out some data from a recent <em>(Oct 10-13)</em> poll, suggesting that her campaign is going down the tubes in a big way.</p>

<p>But what gets me is toward the end, where the suggested remedy for this problem happens to be <em>&quot;staged alien invasion.&quot;</em></p>

<p>I wanted to see if we could get a discussion going on this as I don&#39;t have the cajones to call BSG directly, nor do I trust that they&#39;d even admit it if it&#39;s true.</p>

<p>Some starting observations I&#39;ve made:</p>

<p><strong>1.</strong> The phone number in the document matches the D.C. location phone number on their contact page.</p>

<p><strong>2.</strong> The address in the document does <strong><em>not</em></strong> match the D.C. location on their contact page (nor does the address seem to exist).</p>

<p><strong>3.</strong> WHOIS information says this website went up in the year 2000.</p>

<p><strong>4.</strong> The only meta info I could find in the document was that it was created in Microsoft Word and was originally entitled, &quot;Clinton Internal.docx&quot;<br/>
edit: u/CAMPAIGN_PROMISES reminds me that the meta info includes an <a href="http://imgur.com/a/cE3Nk">author</a>, &quot;Marco.&quot;  </p>

<p><strong>5.</strong> The logo in the document and the logo on the website do not match.<br/>
edit: And as pointed out by u/ManBehindTheThrone, the resolutions of the BSG and Clinton Foundation logos are mismatched.</p>

<p>TL;DR - Found a document allegedly released by the Benenson Strategy Group in partnership with the Clinton Foundation suggesting staged alien invasion as campaign rescue strategy. Want to try and determine whether legit or not.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>He&#39;s talking about the graphics on page one. the resolution and sizing is all wrong between the two graphics. Same with the header/footers. The address is too big and there&#39;s too much of a space between 1 and 000 in the street number. On the last page the graphic is too close to the address header. The fonts used are not consistent with a professional briefing doc, neither is the language.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s easy to spoof. Just change the user account name on OS todo without tools. </p>

<p>Here is my takeaway on the doc it. From the basis it looks like a template. I don&#39;t use Office that much so can&#39; say if it&#39;s one of those. Or one exported from Apple Pages and imported into Office. </p>

<p>Resolution differences on the logos as mentioned is a red flag.</p>

<p>Next: Content - to be honest If I had the time I would do 4/5/6 word snippets throughout put through google for the whole doc. But since I don&#39;t think it&#39;s real in the first place I can&#39;t be bothered. Taking random sentences. </p>

<p>&quot;Distrust in the mainstream media is blunting the impact of the collective polling narrative.&quot; - 1 hit from facebook I have a feeling this is noise from someone posting content. </p>

<p>However I then google &quot;Zikpocalypse&quot; </p>

<p>First and only discussion here before time doc changed/modified into pdf:</p>

<p><a href="http://lunaticoutpost.com/post-13180458.html">http://lunaticoutpost.com/post-13180458.html</a></p>

<p>Try another unusual combo of words &quot;Subterranean thermobaric devices in fracking mines &quot;:</p>

<p>For starters I studied geology. And Mines tend to be subterranean so this choice of words seems sloppy, secondly fracking isn&#39;t really mined. So placing &quot;thermobaric devices in fracking mines&quot; makes little sense practically and really. </p>

<p>And googling back to the first appearance of this doc. </p>

<p>&quot;At Prism Communications, we’re about one thing: winning.
Not winning awards. Not winning praise from pundits. Winning campaigns. YOUR campaign.</p>

<p>To get there, we put you first. We become a full partner in your campaign: from strategic planning to earned media to paid advertising, we help you tell your story and move voters.&quot;</p>

<p>Looks like a legit company, but it&#39;s not the Benenson Strategy Group and doesn&#39;t do polling. Instead, they <em>help you tell your story</em>. Sounds like spin and propaganda to me.</p>
