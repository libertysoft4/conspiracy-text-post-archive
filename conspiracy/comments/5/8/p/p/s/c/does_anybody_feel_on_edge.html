    <div class="md"><p>Me too man! Since roughly Sunday evening (despite being in a great mood) I&#39;ve been having a lot of general discomfort, combined with multiple hours of feeling under the weather emotionally and physically, to the point of suicidal ideation. I haven&#39;t been suicidal in years. This is <em>new</em>, to the point that I&#39;ve even considered the possibility that there is some kind of psychowarfare technology being used on my city. Then I&#39;ll snap out of it and it&#39;ll be like I wasn&#39;t even bummed out, laying in the fetal position 10 minutes before. Even my cat is acting very strange.</p>

<p>edit 2: On top of the emotional malaise, I&#39;ve been going through periods of being <em>very</em> cold. Like every ounce of warmth is being absorbed out of me. Not just usual cold weather either. My good friend has been going through the same thing. On top of that, we&#39;re both very used to the weather in this area. This time of year should be light hoodie weather, and I&#39;ve seen a lot of people in full jackets and scarves despite it not getting much below 60 degrees Fahrenheit.</p>

<p>edit 3: Also factor in inexplicable joint pain. Been having a lot of that too lately. Surprisingly no migraines though, I&#39;m pretty prone to those.</p>

<p>edit: I&#39;ll add to that that there have been a spike in UFO sightings in the last 21 days. More sightings in the first 3 weeks of this month than the last entire month.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not religious either, more just spiritual and I definitely understand. My core seems to be very off the last month or two. Something, deep within in is feeling nothing but dread.  I know many people would brush it off as anxiety, but it&#39;s a far deeper emotion than that.

    <div class="md"><p>I have had similar experiences recently. But there are two particular situations that I can&#39;t get out of my head. I don&#39;t have dreams often, but when I do, it eventually happens in real life. So far, it hasn&#39;t been anything major: usually it&#39;s a conversation with someone or a small event/situation. And it actually happens. It might be the next day or months later. But these last two are freaking me out. It felt so real. The first of the two took place outside. It was just a regular day and I was eating lunch with a lot of other people (the only way I can describe the settings is like a school yard). It was a little windy. There were a couple of banging sounds that sounded like gun shots. Everyone was a little on guard and confused. Then an enormous bang followed the previous ones and debris was coming our way and we were literally blown away. Kind of like a nuclear bomb. The most recent dream I had took place in my home. The internet went down ; turns out, it wasn&#39;t only me but everyone nearby. Then the power went out for everyone as well. It was very dark and everyone in my house went to the living room. We saw a small green light and suddenly there was a extremely loud, low frequency buzz. Both of these dreams ended abruptly. There is no explanation for them. And in a way, I predicted the Internet shutting down. Something is definitely wrong</p>

<p>If it counts, my area has suddenly had a massive increase in car alarms. Normally one will go off once a week at most. Lately, at about the same times every day, it&#39;s been cascades of them. To the point that I&#39;ve been getting pretty sick of it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Feel you. I know when things are coming when I get an odd gut feeling. Has kept me from making tons of bad decisions since I decided it wasn&#39;t a coincidence. </p>

<p>I wouldn&#39;t call it being psychic because I always have to guess what&#39;s coming but sometimes it&#39;s easy. The feeling is persistent for days or weeks ahead of time even when I don&#39;t have a lot of stress or knowledge of something upcoming or anything else going on that would have me on edge but it&#39;s different anyway. </p>

<p>I say a gut feeling partly due to common expression and partly because it feels like it starts there, but it hits my brain the same way hunger does just sending a different signal. It&#39;s the fight or flight instinct that kicks in. My adrenalin starts hitting me in small doses, just enough to partly ruin my sleep and kick my ass into high gear the rest of the time. </p>

<p>The last time it was floods. That was easy to work out because of time of year but nobody believed me anyway because it had never flooded here before. Ha. Owell. I was prepared. </p>

<p>Yes, I have been on edge all month with the flight feeling so much so that I&#39;ve decided I HAVE to move in order to appease the feeling because it&#39;s never been so strong and persistent before. Taking all the steps I can to sell everything and get ready to move. I just don&#39;t have the slightest idea where my gut wants me to go... }÷[ </p>

    <div class="md"><p>My dad had that. He wouldn&#39;t let me go to a party, my first party, because he felt something bad would happen. I was mad, and I argued, but he wouldn&#39;t give in; said he was right about these things, so I gave up and went to bed.</p>

<p>Then, later at school the next day, everyone was talking about the party, and it turned out, nothing happened and it was a fun party. One of the girls there wanted me to be there but ended up making out with this other guy who she stayed with until she got married and had kids with him. He turned out to be a real dick bag. I could have maybe stopped all that with my sweet loving, so you keep that in mind if you ever have kids, Mr..  It&#39;s all fun and games until your dad cock blocks you because he feels like something might happen maybe. Imagine if the world worked like you think it does. Well you do, I guess. Imagine how we all see your view of the world. Well I guess you can&#39;t or you&#39;d see.. CARRY ON. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Lol. What I&#39;m talking about doesn&#39;t seem to extend to small things. I get the little intuitive voice that says maybe you shouldn&#39;t do that or this could be bad, like anyone else for mundane things like that. This is different. It&#39;s a nagging, pulling sensation that doesn&#39;t go away when I stop thinking. It&#39;s disruptive of sleep for extended periods. I don&#39;t think your dad had a feeling compelling him to build a wall and drawbridge around your house prior to being asked about this party, do you?... heh. Sorry your dad cockblocked you tho. </p>

<p>Also I do know it sounds crazy which is why I just anonymously described the feel. I&#39;ve really never described it this way to anyone because I&#39;m more into logic than things I don&#39;t understand.  Gotta keep up appearances and all. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t think what I&#39;m experiencing is special or unique to me. I lean more towards a common human Web of consciousness that science just hasn&#39;t really gotten around to yet. Kind of like how we now know some people can see auras. </p>

<p>Do you ever use being angry as an engine to get things done? It feels kind of like that, without the brooding anger and longer lasting. </p>

<p>Sorry you had what is obviously a traumatic experience concerning someone else&#39;s gut feelings and have never experienced the phenomenon yourself but it&#39;s really no reason to go around attempting to discredit or belittle others. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I too am one of the intuitive &quot;trust your gut&quot;. Although I have a pretty firm catholic family and I&#39;m more spiritual my mom has always believed and encouraged us to &quot;trust the gut&quot;- she often tells the story of 9/11 I was 14 at the time woke up for school and told her something was telling me we all ( siblings, parents) had to stay home and our dog couldn&#39;t go to the groomers. As I sat at the kitchen table watching our local morning news  she called each one of us into school and by the time she called herself into work the report broke of the first plane hitting. </p>

<p>This is going to be the hard part. I too have had dreams I keep a notebook on my nightstand in case anything stands out- for the past year I&#39;ve had the same 2 dreams 
1. A plane explosion 
2. A man in a suit waving and people in shock, crying, and screaming. For some reason I don&#39;t see what happens to the man just the faces of others- it&#39;s very jfk-ish </p>

<p>I&#39;ve had this conversation many times and once with the elder from a native reservation. As we explained our concerns he said something is off in the sky, 2016 would have a lot of celebrity death but one death would shake the nation to its core been thinking about this so much </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Here&#39;s the thing.  I think most people are able to sit back and look at the world and appreciate it.  That is what gives us our humanity and desire to preserve things.</p>

<p>I also think most people have a dark side that understands just how foul and corrupt the world is that we live in.  We all understand that chattel slavery is bad, but the world, for the most part, lives under economic slavery.  You feel it every time you pay taxes and think about where that money is really going.  You pay more every year yet life keeps getting worse and worse and the government is more corrupt.  </p>

<p>The institutions are trying to rig the entire thing for a criminal gangster family who sells you off so they can be rich and powerful.  You know that they hate you and would have you killed and not even lose sleep over it... they may even laugh about it like Hillary did with Gaddafi.</p>

<p>You can feel it and you just want to see it all burn down because you have the hope that some good will come out of it at the end.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>People have been conditioned into feeling like this due to news cycles.  They promote (as in they make a big commotion) certain news stories (big shootings, terrorist attacks, anything like that) every six weeks on average.  Then when there isn&#39;t anything like that in the news for a while people get very anxious because they have been conditioned to expect these events at regular time intervals at a subconscious level.</p>

<p>To be clear, it does not mean that these events only happen on scheduled times.  Just that the media shoves these events in people&#39;s faces on a schedule. There are always awful things happening in the world, but the media has a lot of power when choosing which stories to promote or ignore. </p>

<p>You can be the judge of why they do this.  But keep in mind that people are easier to lead around when they are afraid.</p>

<p>Turns out though from what I&#39;ve seen, we here on <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> and other related subs on reddit...are the actual patriots who care about preserving democracy, and that includes telling people the truth, not suppressing it. Not harboring secrets, not creating classism.  <em>They</em> don&#39;t want any of that.  They want to maintain their status quo of abusing power and using their social network to abuse us.  They think the security state should make all the shots and control every aspect of our lives.  The technocracy is well more advanced and compelling and integrated in ways that orwell could not have imagined in his lifetime.  What we have now is much more advanced than orwellian and accelerating.  It&#39;s basically a technological singularity coming much sooner than we originally thought (2040 ish).  I think we underestimated the role of networking humans by creating an internet for them to cross pollinate ideas and now what I see is an attempt to actually retard that process of cultural evolution and rewind us into a kind of draconian modern dark age, a technoneofeudalism, through suppression, censorship, gaslighting, limiting the spectrum of discourse, political framing, language control and neurolinguistic programming, etc</p>

Anyone who says otherwise has been watching mainstream media only and they are probably also boring people who have lost the ability to be anything but a lumpen consumerton worker bee robot person, repeating funny things heard o the chapelle show instead of coming up wiht their own bit......a consumer of objects, ideas, culture; and they&#39;ve lost the capacity to participate in the creation of culture and the production of ideas and direction.</p>

<p>I agree completely. Nothing in fiction can compare to the absolute shitstorm of the past fifteen years. The normies waking up to this is quite possibly  the greatest thing I have ever seen in my lifetime.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree, it&#39;s completely out of our control anyways. Sure we can come on Reddit and talk about this stuff and pretend that we&#39;re learning the truth or even convincing others about how things really are, but in the end we&#39;re sort of powerless to stop it. Most Americans sadly don&#39;t care or will just stick their heads back in the sand and pretend like it&#39;s the norm. It&#39;s far too easy to distract and deceive people these days.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The problem is the fear is usually used to control people for the purpose of gaining support for things like foreign invasions or mass migration but right now people are being culturally engineered to vote for someone who wants war with another nuclear power and most people seem oblivious or indifferent.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Lol. What I&#39;m talking about doesn&#39;t seem to extend to small things. I get the little intuitive voice that says maybe you shouldn&#39;t do that or this could be bad, like anyone else for mundane things like that. This is different. It&#39;s a nagging, pulling sensation that doesn&#39;t go away when I stop thinking. It&#39;s disruptive of sleep for extended periods. I don&#39;t think your dad had a feeling compelling him to build a wall and drawbridge around your house prior to being asked about this party, do you?... heh. Sorry your dad cockblocked you tho. </p>
