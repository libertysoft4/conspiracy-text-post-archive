I feel like I&#39;m taking crazy pills - how is it that people don&#39;t catch on? Is it because they only watch one to three news sources, and therefore don&#39;t realize that literally everyone is hammering the same nonsense home as if it were the last nail in the coffin? Or is it because the repetitive statements, flashing and twirling sigils, combined with high emotion/minimal logic and research literally hypnotizes them into their MSM ordained position?

    <div class="md"><p>There is a name for this. Its called: censorship. And its usually the very beginning to very bad things, such as fascism.</p>

<p>Tell me if this sounds vaguely familiar with everything that has come to light.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fascism">Fascists</a></strong> believe that liberal democracy is obsolete, and they regard the complete mobilization of society under a totalitarian <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=idrgiAEk2Vs">one-party state</a> as necessary to prepare a nation for armed conflict and to respond effectively to economic difficulties.[7] Such a state is led by a strong leader—such as a dictator and a martial government composed of the members of the governing fascist party—to forge national unity and maintain a stable and orderly society.[7] <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fgcd1ghag5Y">Fascism rejects assertions that violence is automatically negative in nature</a>, and views <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5IuJGHuIkzY">political violence</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fhq9rUWq5eg">war</a>, and imperialism as means that can achieve national rejuvenation.[8][9][10][11] Fascists advocate a mixed economy, with the principal goal of achieving autarky through protectionist and interventionist economic policies.[12]</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Also in the article:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fascism#Totalitarianism">Totalitarianism</a></strong></p>

<p>Fascism promotes the establishment of a totalitarian state.[161] It opposes liberal democracy, rejects multi-party systems, and supports a one-party state. The Doctrine of Fascism states, &quot;The Fascist conception of the State is all-embracing; outside of it no human or spiritual values can exist, much less have value. Thus understood, Fascism is totalitarian, and the Fascist State—a synthesis and a unit inclusive of all values—interprets, develops, and potentiates the whole life of a people.&quot;[162] In The Legal Basis of the Total State, Nazi political theorist Carl Schmitt described the Nazi intention to form a &quot;strong state which guarantees a totality of political unity transcending all diversity&quot; in order to avoid a &quot;disastrous pluralism tearing the German people apart&quot;.[163]</p>

<p>Fascist states pursued policies of social indoctrination through propaganda in education and the media and regulation of the production of educational and media materials.[164][165] Education was designed to glorify the fascist movement and inform students of its historical and political importance to the nation. It attempted to purge ideas that were not consistent with the beliefs of the fascist movement and to teach students to be obedient to the state.[166]</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Trump may be a nationalist at heart, which is a different form of fascism, but it certainly doesn&#39;t appear that he has the propaganda arm that Clinton wields. It doesn&#39;t appear like he&#39;s the one instigating political violence at campaign rallies. It doesn&#39;t appear that he is strong arming the election by painting one party as non-viable due to it being made up of &quot;deplorable&quot; people, effectively pushing for the concept that the US is now a one-party state. It doesn&#39;t appear that he instigating international conflicts with allies by pushing the narrative that Russia is evil and trying to strong arm the election.</p>

<p>It seems like nearly every attack Clinton has brought out against Trump, its because she is trying to deflect against her own record of shittiness. Classic Karl Rove tactic. So when she started trotting out that he was a fascist, thats when I personally started to worry. Meanwhile, Trump has all but certified that he&#39;s just a plant by Clinton to take the fall for the election. Had there been a more popular Republican candidate this cycle, it would have otherwise been too obvious when the results came in heavily for Clinton anyway.</p>

<p>You only have this 20 minutes of fame &quot;journalists&quot; covering this joke of an election. Do you really want to be known as just another shill that took a few bucks from the DNC, or Clinton Foundation? Seriously you&#39;re going to get caught, it is inevitable.

    <div class="md"><p>Force a narrative. It&#39;s that simple. And what&#39;s going in Haiti is a shame, sham and outrageous. 6 years since the earthquake other than food and medical relief what has been done to help Haiti help themselves? </p>

<p>The Clinton Foundation charity work has gone no where including 150 million project. </p>

<p>This shows the public is paying attention to these issue although I doubt they found out from the MSM.</p>

<p>A forcing a narrative and/or constructing a desired answer has been used by survey companies for decades to make a product seem great. Take a survey from a store, car dealer and/or the companies they use you see very specific questions designed to illicit specific answers, not for information but to fit a narrative.</p>
