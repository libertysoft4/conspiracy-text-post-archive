He&#39;s a very intelligent, creative guy, but very, very much to the far left. After trying to explain to him in detail why our government is so corrupt, what&#39;s really going on in the world, my thoughts on who is behind the Wikileaks, and that we need to actually do something about it, here is his response:</p>

<p>&quot;Yeah. I&#39;m sure there&#39;s a whole international network of whistleblowers connected under Wikileaks. Both scenarios are likely to happen. It&#39;s not that I don&#39;t care. I just wanna do something else with the rest of my life than wait out a coup de tat, foreign invasion, domestic wartime and the crap shoot of a new government which even in the best case scenario won&#39;t stop sucking till after I&#39;m dead. The system sucks, but I&#39;ve spent almost 40 years figuring out my place in it. Ain&#39;t nobody got time for a revolution.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What kind of misguided statement is that?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>final revolution</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Going to break the wheel, Khaleesi?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>defend their right to be sheep</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Most people just don&#39;t want to be hassled.  If things get bad enough you&#39;re going to see the people around you have to step up and address their own personality flaws, or sink in potentially dire circumstances.  Time is a test of character.  Calling others sheep isn&#39;t going to help you if things actually do get shitty.  In fact, that&#39;s just one more way to <em>make things shitty</em>.</p>

<p>I remember reading a Bosnian survivor QA and he discussed the necessity of sticking together in groups.  Isolated individuals were easily robbed, raped and murdered.  Groups of fifteen or more tended to dissuade most opportunity crime.</p>

<p>If things actually were to collapse, you&#39;d want to be a part of a <em>flock</em> as quickly as possible.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I hate to say it, but I agree. I can&#39;t be fucked to wait around for a revolution. Both sides are so fucked up that it&#39;s incredible, but at the same time, I have a good 60+ years ahead for myself. If it comes to a revolution, I&#39;ll be more than happy to join in. Until then, however, I can only think of myself and where I&#39;m going for now. It&#39;s just how the climate of our nation is. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;I once felt all that kind of anger, which a man ought to feel, against the mean principles that are held by the Tories: a noted one, who kept a tavern at Amboy, was standing at his door, with as pretty a child in his hand, about eight or nine years old, as I ever saw, and after speaking his mind as freely as he thought was prudent, finished with this unfatherly expression, &quot;Well! give me peace in my day.&quot; Not a man lives on the continent but fully believes that a separation must some time or other finally take place, and a generous parent should have said, &quot;If there must be trouble, let it be in my day, that my child may have peace;&quot; and this single reflection, well applied, is sufficient to awaken every man to duty. Not a place upon earth might be so happy as America.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This chump is roleplaying.</p>

<p>I&#39;m going to give you an answer that you might not like because of how boring it is...</p>

<p>Right now, the power rests with just an ordinary man, but he&#39;s got some extra abilities that he uses to create an illusion of greater power.  He&#39;s still just a figurehead, but from a human perspective, he&#39;s <em>the man</em>.</p>

<p>I honestly don&#39;t know his name, but he looks a little bit like Jim Raynor, actually.</p>

<p>He&#39;s looking for engineers to build the panel device that will give him full control over the world.  Think: Tesla building an iPhone of his own. </p>

<p>Resisting the offer requires some <em>serious</em> help.</p>

<p>The full control will come with the utilization of these devices and, eventually, access to everyone&#39;s desires, capable of manipulating the user through a variety of means, ultimately <em>entering through the eyes</em> and <em>into their minds.</em></p>
