<p>The question is now.</p>

<p>What is safe anymore? Who is safe anymore?</p>

<p>Assange is missing with no word to his safety.  MAJOR changes in WL staffing and Twitter responses.  </p>

<p>Can WL be trusted anymore?  </p>

<p>I think in the next couple weeks we will see blatant false email releases from WL, it already started today. That will prove to discredit any past posts, or at least draw into question the authenticity of them. </p>

<p>I do not think it would be wise to trust anything posted by them in the last few days.</p>

The issue is not whether the Internet can be controlled but rather how to go about assuming control. The technological details are straightforward. Real cleverness lies in the social manipulation necessary as precursor to implementing technological boundaries to Internet use. That is where the devious wealthy elderly win hands down in contest with the idealistic young.&quot;Details are fairly scarce, but these groups are likely to have shared

But you don&#39;t want to hire more people, right, as people make mistakes, need days off, are needy ...  </p>

<p>My solution, if I could get a 7-8 figure influx of capital ... get me two of IBM&#39;s Watson Computers! They run about $3mil each, but will work 24-7, figure out the median reply in each sub and generate a history on their own, as they also (flawlessly) generate new identities and use them to push up posts, in the same manner that you can bury a result in a google search!</p>

<p>I haven&#39;t trusted Wikileaks since they had an agenda. You can say what you want about it all, but face the reality - when Wikileaks started choosing WHEN to release documents for maximum effects, it became an organisation with an agenda.  Giving out raunchy headlines about how you are going to do a release to bring down and expose Clinton is not what Wikileaks should be or was about.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Im right there with you, also a sceptic. I do understand why they release the way they do, every time they have a &quot;shocking&quot; release, their sales go up. They are a business, I get that. Playing the cards they have at the right time is crucially important to them staying relevant,  if they dumped everything they had 10yrs ago, we would not be speaking. </p>

<p>Specific to WL, they have always guarded sources, and part of that bargain is that we have to trust they&#39;ve always done adequate due diligence on the docs and source(s). The trust arrangement is not ideal, and at any point in their history, they could&#39;ve been infiltrated or given forgeries or limited hangouts. The best gauge for authenticity of their propagated documents are cases like Chelsea Manning and Assange&#39;s predicament. WL has never been a &quot;safe&quot; arrangement or an ideal, totally trustworthy source.</p>
