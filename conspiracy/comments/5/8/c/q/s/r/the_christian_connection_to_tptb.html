How is it that the Bible called out the fact that in the &quot;end times&quot; (based on the fact that this scripture is in revelation.) That the Jews would be the synagogue of Satan. Thousands of years before anyone. Inferring knowing this was to come to pass.</p>

<p>Would this in a way prove Christianity right?  I really wonder considering the removal of the Apocrypha and the research of Sula Benet on  Kaneh Bosum. There is a lot left to answer but I hope for meaningfull discussion from open minded people. </p>

<p>I know thy works, and tribulation, and poverty, (but thou art rich) and I know the blasphemy of them which say they are Jews, and are not, but are the synagogue of Satan. KJV ..Revelation 3:9</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is my understanding and belief, based on the research I&#39;ve done.</p>

<p>The people who conjured up the Abrahamic religions, date back to Mesopotamia. They are among the priest class/elder survivors of the Great Deluge, and they are no friends to us common humans. They are also still in charge today. The reason the bible makes so many predictions and appears to be coming to fruition, is because they are guiding it and have guided it since the Dawn. Self fulfilling prophecy.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thank you for your input Puty :) I have thought along the same lines about it being kind of a script and having been used by TPTB. Though their has to be some truth to it then for having called it that far back? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re welcome, mate. I think there is a lot of truth to the various religious texts, it&#39;s just encoded/encrypted and not for the common person to understand. I&#39;ve had thoughts and theories that, that is the point. Ascension out of the primitive mind via the esoteric. Maybe it&#39;s an initiation test, maybe they are here to help us (or certain people) ascend? Maybe it&#39;s not nefarious, and our primitive minds just <em>think it is</em>.. </p>

<p>Truly a fascinating topic. One in which I love thinking and talking about.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Lemme ask you this. I found a quote about &quot;divergent thinking&quot; and thought you might think this is why (tongue in cheek) some of us here are &quot;divergent thinkers&quot;  </p>

<p>Researchers from the University College London discovered that marijuana heightens the brains automatic semantic priming abilities - This is the ability to draw connections between seemingly unrelated concepts, also known as &quot;divergent Thought.&quot; and is the source of creativity, and identified as what actually makes a person creative. - Hyper priming in cannabis users: a naturalistic study of the effects of cannabis on semantic memory function. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think there is a helluva lot to that. Mind altering substances, unlock the brain. Depending on the person, certain substances work for better or worse. Some people take to substances A, but get trapped, some people take to substance A and are released. The brain is a very interesting thing, and we are not all the same, in that sense nor are our spirit beings. </p>

<p>Which is a very interesting thought, because one person can interpret passage B as one thing, but another person can interpret passage B as another. Which raises the idea, that it&#39;s about you and you alone. Not to say you are The Creator, but a Creator for the Creator created you a certain way for a certain purpose. </p>

<p>Everyone has certain trials and tribulations, for a reason, and the map (holy texts) is not a google map (point a -&gt; b) direction, but more of a: &quot;head north and follow the brightest star in the sky&quot;. Each person will take different routes and encounter different things.</p>

<p>I&#39;m kind of going on a tangent here now, lol.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>no this makes perfect sense .... i always wondered about colors like is the green i see the green you see or we both agree that the sky is blue [but what if my blue is your yellow] right we agree but have totally different experiences </p>

<p>and dont think for one moment that i am still not quite over your mind blowing red is masculine blue is feminine treatise....i still do not know which way to think about those colors at all anymore because if that theyve kinda fused...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree it depends on each persons perspective. I don&#39;t know if we are not spirit beings. I feel we have a soul based on NDE&#39;s. Considering their testimony after the fact. I agree though that it is about you alone but considering we are all one in a very fundamental way, it is as if we are all on our own personalized journey yet their is many others going through their own. Kind of like Bill Hicks was alluding too. </p>

<p>&quot;Today, a young man on acid realized that all matter is merely energy condensed to a slow vibration – <strong>that we are all one consciousness experiencing itself subjectively</strong>. There&#39;s no such thing as death, life is only a dream, and we&#39;re the imagination of ourselves. Here&#39;s Tom with the weather.” Bill Hicks</p>

<p>I agree its not a road map but to the one who raises their consciousness might grasp that much more out of it. Kinda interesting wording of following a star in the sky but I see what you are saying.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ok so when certain people Die they have experiences of being in a body that is not their physical body. They have reported having 360 degree view and other things like knowing what was going on when they were pronounced dead. Even a friend of mine has testified to the fact that he said he was on the other side and could see what was going on. He was screaming at the doctors but they could not hear him. Then some other things I do not recall right now. Either way there is a lot we don&#39;t know. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>my mom told me when i was 5 and asked about heaven ok she said that she was an extistentialist ok so that she really couldnt sugar coat this for me [hell i was 5 a simple yes woulda been great and ergo i went to dad with this issues thereafter ] but i digress she and my dad had a bad car accident years ago and she had the complete near death experience HER of all person [even she said it] the tunnel thelight everything  so ,,,, i also know someone who had a complete out of body experience durin a seizure and they could describe everything that went on in every room at that time...</p>

<p>i just recently watched some yuotbues about quantum physics and how quantum can explain the death experience its so liberating cuz i think i get it now</p>

<p>and ofcourse we all reincarnate</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I totally understand the Idealism of existentialist mentality. It&#39;s objective in the sense of &quot;it is what it is&quot; Though the quantum physics studies have shown that their is no &quot;out there&quot; There &quot;is&quot; what we project out there then how we perceive it. In a way it <em>is</em> as if we are creating our reality by our beliefs and attitudes. Also by our actions. </p>

<p>The reincarnation thing I cant wrap my head around quite yet but I am open minded. </p>

<p>Also I am sorry to hear about you Dad or both your parents? I am kinda confused the way you worded that. Forgive me. My mom passed away in a car wreck when I was 4. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>i am so sorry my dad died last november it was just the accident itself made her realize ok that she needed to rethink her process because of all people who didnt beleive it there it was for her to experience....</p>

<p>i feel things empathetically....so i have been kicking around a theory that we shift dimensional planes ok like here we are trapped in the 3rd dimension and can only move in only direction on the time line... but that in other shifting dimensions other factors [whether they limit or not ] exist see so the quantum explains that cuz a particule can be in two or more places at the same time..... but the internal process of the quantum within us was the part that seemed harded to bridge but the explanation for Quantum hedonism ties the micro of ourselves right back to the macro of the continuum at large</p>

<p>really you dont know about how you feel about reincarnation it was the first thing i DID beleive as soon as it was explained to me plus i am somewhat sensative to deja vu and past life recall ....</p>

<p>wow you were young to have to say good bye to mom i feel for you that!  i think she is close to you everyday still .... thats what i mean about the shifting dimensions around us....</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh, I understand now what you were saying. I think you might like this video I watched earlier because you are talking about how our emotions may be a way of shifting dimensions because that is pretty much the just of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3z1SWP9uos">this video</a> Well its actually easy for me to grasp because of the bing bang. If all matter which ain&#39;t a lot. Something like .000001 of the universe and the .9999 of so called empty space was once the size of a pea the we are all connected in some micro way. I have had all sorts of deja vu and weird things. My grandma to this day said i had a poster that showed 9/11 before it happened. She would tell you today that. All sorts of stuff. I see it this way concerning my mother, it happened and without defeat you cannot appreciate victory. Either way I feel once this life&#39;s over we are in a better place anyways.  Hope you enjoy the video. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Dang look at this one about creativity. Used 148 male and 130 female college students as Ss and replicated and expanded upon previous findings in marijuana personality research.<strong>It was found that the greater the self-reported frequency of marijuana use across Ss, the higher the cores on creativity and adventuresomeness tests tended to be and the lower the scores on autoritarianism tended to be.</strong> Males were more frequent users than females; <strong>Jews more frequent users than Protestants or Catholics.</strong> A new variable, internal sensation novelty seeking, was found to be correlated with self-reported frequency of marijuana use. Self-reported length of marijuana use was not related to any of the major variables, with the singular exception that after 2 years of use, expressed boredom with the environment decreased significantly. </p>

<p>So let me see if you smoke Cannabis you are going to be more creative, less apt for authoritarian idealism (if i am reading this right) and you will have thoughts that don&#39;t just go along with many others? Sounds like Cannabis undermines TPTB at its core. </p>

<p>This seems to be exactly why TPTB fear Cannabis IMHO.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Here is how it worked.</p>

<p>The whole thing, all of it, the timeline, the blueprint was created by TPTB bloodline.</p>

<p>They did the Jesus Christ death and resurrection hoax. They were always the synagogue of satan. With the Christ hoax they could control the masses.</p>

<p>Revelations is their end game.</p>

<p>TPTB wiped out the ancient Egyptians and no doubt has been hoarding technology for thousands of years.</p>

<p>Who knows how many times they restarted this biological matrix we live in.</p>

<p>With each iteration they introduce changes to the control mechanism. The bible in the long run worked out quite well for them... Lots of control and lots of death.</p>

<p>It&#39;s losing its touch though.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have thought along the same lines for a while but honestly I am starting to believe their is more to this story of the bible than is really known at this time by the masses. Their is a lot that we don&#39;t know but there is also a lot of scriptures that have not been given to us because the Vatican holds them. Not only that but the Freemasons tie their history directly back to King Solomans temple. I totally understand your view point though. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think originally people found out we were under a dome. The bible was the solution to give people a reason why.</p>

<p>When we started shooting rockets into the sky, people start to ask questions. It&#39;s why the synagogue of satan and NASA have a monopoly on space.</p>

<p>They formed an elaborate system of explanation.</p>

<p>It&#39;s ludicrous to think that people didn&#39;t find out the earth was a sphere until Columbus sailed the ocean blue in 1400s...advanced civilizations have existed for thousands of years prior with advanced technology and even had longitudes and latitudes mapped out, and built the coordinates into megalithic structures.</p>

<p>Please watch:</p>

<p>The Code by Carl Munck</p>

<p>It will shift reality for you. It&#39;s a lecture that shows all megalithic structures across the world are connected through math. Each one gives the lat and long of the next. It&#39;s amazing. It&#39;s on YouTube.</p>

<p>I think our planet is much bigger than they let us think. Outside our dome, there could be hundreds of other habitats.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I actually have seen that film. I cannot say that any of that is not true and really I am sure that we have had advanced civilizations. Though is that not really still within the realm of reasoning in the bible considering the fallen angels from heaven that God struck down? </p>

<p>Perhaps once we finish this life, if we have kind hearts and souls, our energy is transfered to another habitat, heaven.</p>
