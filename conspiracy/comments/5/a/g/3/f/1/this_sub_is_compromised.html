    <div class="md"><p>Just to throw something out there that I&#39;m more passionate about, marijuana legalization. 
Bear with me. </p>

<p>I talked to a guy at work and told him about how it would be good money for the state and his response? &quot;Fuck no you&#39;d see people crashing cars everywhere acting crazy&quot; 
And other responses I get from other people? The typical &quot;it&#39;s a dangerous drug&quot; &quot;gateway drug&quot; &quot;it&#39;s stupid&quot; &quot;you burn your money away&quot;
And of those people almost all of them drink alcohol. Why? Because it&#39;s more socially acceptable. How many beer/liquor commercials do you see? Or ads, if you don&#39;t watch tv. It&#39;s proof that they can easily brain wash people...but how do we get over this &quot;spell&quot;? Education. Educate, educate, educate. I can not stress it more. Shit, people used to smoke cigarettes like it was drinking water. Doctors even promoted smoking cigarettes. Then what happened? The public became more knowledgable. And now today, cigarettes are frowned upon by way more people compared to the 50&#39;s ish time frame. </p>
