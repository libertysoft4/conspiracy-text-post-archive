<ul>
<li><p><strong>The Clinton Administration back in 1999 was first interested in using<a href="http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2016/04/12/fresh-document-trove-sheds-light-on-clinton-trump-ties.html">Trump as a Third-Party candidate in the Clinton &amp; Gore administartion</a>.</strong></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Donald Trump <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2016/08/24/politics/trump-clinton-foundation-donation/index.html">donated between 101k-250k to the Clinton Foundation in 2009</a></strong> </p></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
<p><em>Trump didn&#39;t answer Cruz&#39;s second question about what he would say in a debate with Clinton, given those past donations. &quot;The last person that Hillary Clinton wants to face is Donald Trump, that I can tell you,&quot; Trump said when pressed.</em> - <a href="http://www.washingtonexaminer.com/trump-on-why-he-donated-to-clinton-im-in-business/article/2584918">source</a></p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
<li><p><strong><a href="https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/3990">email found from top Clinton Campers discussing this very scenario.</a></strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Right now I am petrified that Hillary is almost totally dependent on Republicans nominating Trump....she has huge endemic political weaknesses that she would be wise to rectify.....even a clown like Ted Cruz would be an even money bet to beat and this scares the hell of out me.....&quot;</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><p><strong><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/apr/25/delaware-tax-loophole-1209-north-orange-trump-clinton">Clinton and Trump both share the same business address to avoid taxes</a></strong></p></li>
<li><p><strong><a href="http://people.com/politics/chelsea-clinton-says-shed-consider-daughters-summit-with-ivanka-trump/">Chelsea Clinton and Ivanka Trump are BFF and although downplayed by media, surprisingly they are not quiet about it.</a></strong></p></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>This of course is the smoking gun, which is the phone call last year right before Trump announced and after Hillary did.</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>Former president Bill Clinton had a private telephone conversation in late spring with Donald Trump at the same time that the billionaire investor and reality-television star was nearing a decision to run for the White House, according to associates of both men.</em></p>

<p><em>Four Trump allies and one Clinton associate familiar with the exchange said that Clinton encouraged Trump’s efforts to play a larger role in the Republican Party and offered his own views of the political landscape.
  The call came as Trump was making a final decision about whether to run. Clinton sounded curious about Trump’s moves toward a presidential bid and told Trump that he was striking a chord with frustrated conservatives and was a rising force on the right.</em> </p>

<p><em>One person with knowledge of Clinton’s end of the call said the former president was upbeat and encouraging during the conversation, which occurred as Trump was speaking out about GOP politics and his prescriptions for the nation.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Donald Trump was pro-choice and for universal healthcare <a href="https://youtu.be/N5A02pNcGHs">and here is Donald Trump talking about Hillary Clinton running in 2016</a></strong>
I ask any rational thinking person, after reading this do you truly think Trump is the lone gunman?  One who told people to vote on the wrong day? One who calls women pigs in the middle of the night on twitter? </p>

<p>People claim these conspiracy theories non factual, but I ask them, of the evidence I provided all of this is factual, and I am finding the harder theory to believe the theory that Trump wants to be president. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I feel you.</p>

<p>I wanted to vote for Stein to help the green party. But ultimately decided against it because with money in politics at the moment all I envisioned was another super-pac ran party pandering to 3rd party interests. One of those &quot;you thought it was bad with 2 party&#39;s, you ain&#39;t seen nothing yet&quot; scenarios. I&#39;m probably just doom and glooming though.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Great analogy. Too bad the better option was first considered by the Clinton administration back 99.  </p>

<p>Voting doesnt do shit. The facade is set to divide us up.
Look at the facts.  Bill Clinton called trump and told him to run. Trump donated to the Clinton foundation and the Clinton campaign. 250+. So has trumps family.
In fact ivana and Chelsea are best friends. </p>

<p>At what point did Donald trump and bill Clinton break their ties? Everybody is so sure that they hate eachother, well then how is it they spoke on good terms talking about the election?  </p>

<p>Do you really think trumps just going to spit in your face? 
I am extremely happy clinton is not in office. But now I am sure the end of America is nigh.</p>

<p>Soros is funding the anti trump protests and the recount just to get us all worked up and mad at each other while these rich fucks get away with stealing our democracy and flooding our airwaves with their propaganda.</p>

<p>The sad thing is we&#39;re buying into it and turning on our fellow Americans while the corporate elite laugh at us. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m aware of Trump&#39;s past with the Clintons. But, there are several possibilities here.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Trump was considered an easy win for Hillary. I mean, there&#39;s no way Trump will get enough support to win, right? Have Bill call Don and talk him into running. Stroke his ego a little bit and it will be smooth sailin for the Clintons from there, right?</p></li>
<li><p>Trump agreed to run against Hillary and lose, but changed his mind after he got that vote of confidence from the people chanting &quot;Trump! Trump! Trump!&quot;. Pair that with the dirt he received on the Clintons and officially went rogue because HE thought it would be an easy win for him.</p></li>
<li><p>Trump has been on the Clinton&#39;s side the whole time and still is and somehow ruining the Clinton&#39;s chance at another 8 years in office benefits them???</p></li>

    <div class="md"><ol>
<li><p>So at what point did the don turn against bill?  And say he is an evil awful womanizing man?  I don&#39;t see where exactly their relationship became hostile.  Bill and Donald both have been on the Lolita express with their good friend Jeff. </p></li>
<li><p>........ trump agreed to run just like he would have run had they wanted him to in 2000.  You see the funny thing about having two candidates who secretly are working for the same boss, it doesn&#39;t matter who wins. He was nominated very well knowing he might have won had this pizza gate wikileaks shit happened. That&#39;s why they had to really make sure Bernie wasn&#39;t going to get nominated.</p></li>
<li><p>too close minded, hillary wanted it. But she is tied down with too many interests groups and her promises. She lost, wikileaks sealed that deal. But at the end of the day, the establishment won.  Trump isn&#39;t ruining Clinton&#39;s chance, Clinton is ruining Clinton&#39;s chance. When you trace the ties and follow the money you find they are very well connected. </p></li>
