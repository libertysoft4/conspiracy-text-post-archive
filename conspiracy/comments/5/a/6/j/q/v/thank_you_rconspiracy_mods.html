<p>No, because the two words together do not make any sense in the English language.</p>

<p>Conspiracy is a legal definition in criminal law,  when someone conspires or agrees with someone else to do something which, if actually carried out, would amount to a crime.</p>

<p>I see it all the time on reddit, <em>conspiracy people</em>, <em>conspiracy thinking</em> etc</p>

<p>It doesn&#39;t make any sense.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think the moderators appreciate seeing these posts on occasion so thank you OP. It&#39;s easy to say moderating can be a thankless task at times and we do get a fair amount of shit slung our way but ultimately it is worth it. </p>

<p>All of the moderators here know that freedom of information is paramount to the subreddits values and we endeavour to uphold those values. We don&#39;t always agree, we don&#39;t always get on but the team unit is strong and all of us believe in the freedom to discuss controversial topics and issues. </p>

<p>What&#39;s important however is that we caretake the page and leave the important stuff to the community. Ultimately the important stuff is the content. The community make the page and as the years have rolled by, subs like r/conspiracy have more than proved their worth. We aren&#39;t the last bastion of free speech however, that claim would be egotistical. </p>

<p>What we are is a platform for open discussion and transparency.</p>

<p>The moderation team will always strive to keep it this way. </p>

<p>We all appreciate your support. </p>

In spite of troll brigades attempting to sow discord between this userbase and modteam, admins openly mocking us at every opportunity, and a years long campaign by some irc trolls to submit vicious anti-Semitic propaganda as a form of libel, this subreddit continues to thrive. </p>

<p>Reddit could be a powerful tool for humanity, but it has been reshaped into a propaganda machine. I admire the mods for allowing the community to discuss and post their views, without fear of being banned as long as they follow the rules. </p>

<p>I often read about the &quot;Hive Mind&quot; as being this thing we should regard with disgust, but I don&#39;t see it that way. I see lawyers, accountants, taxi drivers, nurses, dish washers, and self made business owners. This is where they are able to have discussions and receive responses by others who may or may not share that view. </p>

<p>I wish I could contribute more to this sub and am always amazed by information I obtain from here. The amount of work that the community does is humbling, and it would not be possible without the Mods of conspiracy.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>First off, thanks to all the mods here. I&#39;m sure you all put up with a lot of shit and it can be a thankless position. Special shout out to <a href="/u/mr_dong">/u/mr_dong</a>, best mod on reddit and one of my favorite posters.</p>

<p>Secondly, not sure if any mods are still lurking about in this thread but I figure since this post is directed at you all this may be a good place to bring this up.</p>

<p>I&#39;m sure many remember the strangeness which happened awhile ago with <a href="/u/Sarah_Connor">/u/Sarah_Connor</a>. I won&#39;t go into the details, but last I remember hearing about it was that the mods were going to try speaking with the admins to see if they could get them removed from the mod list.
I guess that didn&#39;t pan out though.</p>

<p>Flash forward to about a month ago. I checked the users page out of curiosity only to find that the post history had beenwiped wiped. Thought that was pretty odd.</p>

<p>After seeing this thread I looked over the mod list and decided to check out said user once again.</p>

<p>Seems that as of two days ago post have started being made with the account again. Which I find troubling.</p>

<p>Has anyone been in contact with them? I worry about that user being a weak link when it comes to keeping the integrity of the sub intact. After the post they made on an alt and the long absence, it just seems like an account that may be a prime target for, I dunno, the FBI, or other groups like ctr. With them being so high on the mod list, it would be easy to cause major problems if that account fell into the wrong hands.</p>

<p>Just wanted to toss that out there.</p>
