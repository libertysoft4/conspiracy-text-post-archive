    <div class="md"><p>Yeah I could easily see it. Trump almost split the GOP. If it wasn&#39;t for people disliking Hillary so much (if anyone else had been running for Dems) it would have. Now the Dems could be closer to a split. The fact that either party could split is a good indicator of how messed up our country is politically. I would much rather have 3 or 4 parties, because they more there are the smarter the people get. The more tempered the candidates have to be. You will see candidates who are conservative but pro gay rights and pro choice, because they can afford to shed the more extreme voters since they don&#39;t have to go after 50 percent.
It would be nice, people would vote on issues and people would get smarter.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is actually a time that having the process of an Electoral College benefits us. </p>

<p>When you vote for President, you&#39;re not voting for a person. My ballot, for example, actually reads &quot;the electors of Hillary Clinton&quot; and &quot;the electors of Donald Trump&quot; next to the check-box. Each candidate hand-picks a certain number of people to submit their ballots to the Electoral College in December. They&#39;re usually party insiders, trusted supporters, or otherwise highly connected people. For example, in California, had John McCain won the 55 electoral votes, Arnold Schwarzenegger would have been one of the 55 people submitting a ballot to the Electoral College.</p>

<p>Anyway, those electors can put whatever name they want on the ballot. Some states have un-enforceable requirements that they go along with the popular vote, but, no one has ever tested these legally. We&#39;ve had several &quot;faithless electors&quot; in the past, I know one voted for John Edwards for President instead of John Kerry in 2004. They are never challenged or prosecuted. That&#39;s why only party insiders and trusted faithful are ever picked for the job--because you really don&#39;t want one &quot;going rogue&quot;.</p>

<p>In the event that Hillary steps down, is forced out, incapacitated, or in any other way removed, all that has to happen is the 270+ or whatever people who are the Electors voted on to vote for her will gather and go along with whatever the plan is.</p>

<p>The DNC can tell them to vote for Bernie or Kaine or whoever. Their case would actually be strengthened should Hillary step aside before the election: they could put out a press statement beforehand saying &quot;All Voters: A vote for Hillary will be counted by her Electors as a vote for Bernie&quot;, and the Electors would feel bound to honor the public&#39;s wishes.</p>

<p>It&#39;s the same process that would be used should a candidate die between election day and the date the Electoral College votes... the Electors who were bound to that candidate could convene with the party and decide on a replacement candidate. </p>

<p><strong>TL;DR:</strong> technically, anyone could be the fill-in, because of the indirect process of the Electoral College makes it easy to change to another candidate.</p>
