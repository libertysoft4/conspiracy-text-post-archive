    <div class="md"><p>It gets MUCH worse than this. When you die you will be pulled into the &quot;Fake Heaven&quot; which is actually an Astral Holding Area. After a period you will be judged by the &quot;Archons&quot;. They will then say you must return for &quot;More Lessons&quot; and to remove &quot;Karmic Debt&quot;. Both are complete scams. Your memories will be erased and you will be reinserted into this hellhole. We are used over and over as &quot;Energy Slaves&quot;. The Archons are Parasites, and the Earth Global Elite work for them.. Google: 1)Archons White Light 2)Archons Reincarnation 3)Archons Lords Of Karma 4)Archons Reptilians 5) White Light Trap 6)Gnostics Archons 7)Illuminati Archons 8)Illuminati Lords Of Karma 9)Reincarnation Memory Erase. If you take the time and google search all these, you will come across a large amount of information..  It is much worse than you could imagine. If you google search what I have listed, you will come across an enormous amount of information.

    <div class="md"><p>The airport has been constructed in the shape of a Swastika when viewed from above. The Free Masons prominently displayed a capstone designating the building as “The New World Airport.”
  The AIRPORT features six underground levels, of which spokespersons claim are unused. That is: six, unused, underground levels; at an AIRPORT. Perhaps the most troubling aspect of this facility is the mural of a military apocalypse painted on the interior wall for travelers to “appreciate.” The mural depicts oppressive fascist soldiers, fires, and a dead child in a casket.
  Some people express disbelief claiming this is simply conspiracy theory nonsense. For me too many coincidences exist when considering the planners spent billions of dollars designing and constructing a marvel such as this; one which was downsized from the previous international airport.  </p>

<p>On the Arkansas border is a massive underground fortress designed for surviving the end of the world. Billions of tax dollars were allocated to complete the project. Located along the Ozark Mountains is Ozark, Missouri; a little farm town in the middle of nowhere which features a bank for every fifty-one people.
  Tying in with the timing of this massive underground construction project is the number of earthquakes reported.  In 2009 Arkansas experienced thirty-six. Since construction began, Arkansas experienced 788 in 2011 alone. The facility encompasses fifty million square feet. It is climate controlled, has a rail system, a vast network of underground roads, food warehouses, offices, underground farming, on-site manufacturing, and stockpiles of oil.  Construction witnesses assert the facility connects directly to Denver International Airport using an underground tunnel more than 550 miles in length.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ll be called crazy but I think the article reasonably explained everything. A lot of artist are fucking weird and do weird shit. It&#39;s why they&#39;re so creative. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hi! Wiccans aren&#39;t Satanists. satanists worship the Devil, Wiccans don&#39;t believe in the devil, so &quot;Wiccan type Satanists&quot; is incorrect. </p>
