Unless they are all named and brought before the world court at the Hague, our planet will continue on its course to oblivion, where we will be out scavenging for food from trash cans while they all dictate which trash cans we can scavenge from.  It&#39;s really hard to take power away from the powerful.  But we have to remember that in the end, they are human.  They are not gods, and they are not untouchable, despite what they would have us believe.  Something must be done before all out nuclear war begins.</p>

<p>In order to continue exchanging goods, citizens would have to work together to build, create, make, grow, etc and trade goods/services. </p>

<p>Obviously this is far fetched and would be more complicated in the execution than just theorizing it. </p>

Not the little bit that they have so far for people that know like us who can see the truth but completely so people that are still asleep within the system are forced to see this reality. We have to let the elite&#39;s plans move forward and ready ourselves and wait for the moment when they believe that they are about to succeed then destroy them from within. Most people are still too confused to know who their real enemy is.</p>

<p>If any one of them was to be found to personally be a racist we could bring them down just by public pressure because that&#39;s a taboo type of personality in a leader or in a private person  that we just don&#39;t tolerate.</p>

<p>If any one of them was found to express himself as a homophobic it would be fairly easy for them to brought down by public pressure because that&#39;s the latest new taboo personality type we recently created by public consensus.</p>

<p>Leaders can be brought down for being several other taboo personalty types such as witch hunters or  cannibals.</p>

<p>It can be done and it has been done recently.</p>

<p>Recently the Pope was forced to resign because of public pressure after he claimed that child porn was near normal. </p>

<p>Citation.</p>

<p>The pope resigned a few weeks after saying pedophilia is near normal</p>

<p><a href="http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/news/world-news/popes-child-porn-normal-claim-sparks-outrage-among-victims-28577483.html">http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/news/world-news/popes-child-porn-normal-claim-sparks-outrage-among-victims-28577483.html</a></p>

<p>I had predicted he would &#39;run away&#39;  under an older account name . The truth, like science, can be  predicted and  tested.</p>

<p>We now need to turn our attention to creating a new taboo type of personality. That is clinical  psychopaths and sociopaths in leadership positions.</p>

<p>They make every decision based on one single criteria regardless of other factors. That single thing they base all of their  decisions on is personal greed.</p>

<p>The damage they do is  far greater to the public at large than even the worst of the personalities  we already take out of power. All that&#39;s needed is sufficient public pressure and  a catchy, jingly new name for them that  the public can get behind .</p>

I don&#39;t believe that lol so anyone that is about to mash on the keyboard relax. 
A lot of revolt in history was usually resolved with large estates and wealth granted to the top people starting the revolt, then, they either shut up or were hung themselves outside the public eye. That&#39;s why a lot of successful rebels like William Wallace were killed in such brutal fashion <em>in</em> the public eye, because they wouldn&#39;t give in, and become hypocrites themselves. 
I think in this day and age, with a literal big brother watching over us, or best bet is use our freedom of speech while we have it to keep spreading ideas to those still reading inside the lines. Through the internet, but most importantly from person to person in your daily lives. People don&#39;t want to talk to their neighbors any more, it any one for that matter, build up casual conversations with people you see, like the grocer you always see at the store, co-workers, the clerk always working the gas station, homeless always hanging out at places you frequent and spread ideas. They can&#39;t scroll past that like on Facebook or Reddit. 
From there..... Your guess is as good as mine. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You idiots saying stop paying taxes don&#39;t know what you are talking about. Your employee will not allow this and even if they do, the government sends a &quot;mandatory compliance&quot; letter that requires them to take out taxes. Even if you don&#39;t file a return they are still keeping the minimum tax that has been paid in and you get nothing back even if you overpaid. Trust me, I have done this and it&#39;s only possible for a few years.</p>

<p>Because an insurrection against the government won&#39;t do anything to the elites.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Holy shit, you are asking the right question! (If I believed in supporting reddit, I would give you gold).</p>

<p>To begin with, I don&#39;t believe insurrection against politicians or the government will do it. We could shoot them all, and their replacements would be there by next election. (and to be clear, I&#39;m not calling for insurrection).</p>

<p>I believe we can generally win by accomplishing only two goals: taking back the media and the Federal Reserve. Most people simply don&#39;t consider views that aren&#39;t mentioned on mainstream media, and taking control of the Fed would de-fund the fatcats.</p>

<p>We may need to also re-take the elite colleges and universities, although I&#39;m not sure if this is 100% necessary to achieve in the short-term. Once Harvard, Yale, Johns Hopkins, etc. start teaching people to think, this will trickle down through the rest of society.</p>
