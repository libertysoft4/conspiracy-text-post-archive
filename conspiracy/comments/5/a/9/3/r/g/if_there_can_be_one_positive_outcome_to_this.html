<p>The government doesn&#39;t provide any of that. They steal your money then pay people to do those things, while taking a cut. Why not just communities get together and pay for what they need? All of those things can be done by private parties/sector. Sorry. But what you just regurgitated was liberal/progressive lies/talking points.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>so that unregulated fracking screws your water
so burying your poo and piss in your back yard is pretty efficient
not sure where these private maintained roads exist.
Solar panels and generators, why don&#39;t I just go sharpen a stick and hunt me a bear.
Private education huh, ok. Most private education is governed by a church...yes the word used was governed.
Private practice with doctors educated by the local witch doctor because you&#39;ve done away with government education.</p>

<p>Look, if you are into the off the grid thing, then go for it. I like what modern civilization has to offer, and it does a significant part of that with government, seen and unseen. But you win. Sure, it&#39;s a reasonably free country. Go build your cabin in the woods, dig a well to drink from, dig a hole to poop in (don&#39;t put them close together), edumacate those youngins with the best free education the free total capitalist economy minus any government has to offer.</p>

<p>Oh look at that highly organized and governed group of people coming to take all your crap. Oh, no standing army. That&#39;s a bitch ain&#39;t it? Oh no borders around your lands? May as well be a Native American. Yeah, your plan is brilliant. Simply cancel out all modern civilization. Cancel out the internet too, as that was a government program as well.</p>
