The government does not make mistakes like this. They are not fumbling around. Everything has a purpose. If the FBI is re-opening an investigation and new information is coming to light, there is a reason why they want this to happen. Perhaps they never wanted Clinton in there at all.  Remember to stay skeptical my friends. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>i mean, george soros funds those kinds of coups right? my theory is that clinton gets fake-voted in, trump and prettymuch anyone else flips out, government collapses and the guy with the most money can fund a politician that will appeal to the broken nation<br/>
literally the first doc i watched on soros explained how he did this in other countries, i can only assume its the same thing for this one</p>

<p>Hillary in an obviously rigged election is voted in despite all the controversy. Shit hits the fan with civil unrest. Martial Law. Government collapse. Here comes the &quot;savior&quot; and the complete eradication of the constitution. No more democracy. No more freedom. Police state. Blue Helmets. Patriots fighting against occupying force deemed a &quot;civil war&quot; and played out on the world stage as such. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Why would you assume they are patriots? Putin was a patriot in the KGB, and he used that power to completely rape his country: he may be the richest man in the world from plundering the capital of his nation. It takes a mind blowing stupidity to think this was an act of patriotism. They have the data to take out Trump, too, but where&#39;s that leak? It&#39;s not that I like Clinton, I don&#39;t. Patriotism would be taking out both candidates, then using data to force a new constitutional convention.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Here&#39;s the latest from the deep state: &quot;You have freedom of speech but you do not have freedom from the consequences of that speech.&quot; </p>

<p>In short, while the internet appears free, every single bit of information is being vacuumed up by a vampire squid that inspects and assembles profiles which, depending on what happens next, can result in yourself being vacuumed up. Assemblages of whatever the deep state desires can be presented in evidence and <em>the consequences</em> of your speech may be pending. </p>

<p>In their defense they&#39;ll say, &quot;...but we didn&#39;t make a <strong>law</strong> banning free speech!&quot; Such is the nature of oppression; the outcome of feeding a surveillance state.</p>

<p>Not sure I buy that in this instance though, the look on Hillary and Huma&#39;s face in the 2 photos I&#39;ve seen taken shortly after their learning of the FBI re-opening the investigation did not at all look comfortable or like this was a planned thing in order to discredit wikileaks etc.</p>

<p>That is my point.</p>

<p>I hope you&#39;re right but I&#39;d go on more than just a couple of photos to confirm a theory. I don&#39;t deny your theory though. The important thing is to question everything.</p>
