        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>This is very long-winded, sorry but I really would like some feedback.</p>

<p>I have noticed a disturbing trend lately in the information war. There has been a shift in tactics. It seems the establishment has shifted from a reactive strategy to a more proactive one. They seem to now be actively targeting theories and engaging in disinformation campaigns. This change in tactics could actually be good news in a way as it means someone has gotten close to something they weren&#39;t supposed to. Now we just have to find it.</p>

<p>When the DNC was hacked the establishment seemed unfazed, like it didn&#39;t care. There was plenty of condemnation, a buzz emerged, and died down. Life went on.</p>

<p>Flash forward to the primaries, things begin to get interesting. Guys come out of left-field and start making waves. Sanders and Trump independently spawn movements. The establishment on both sides is reeling. Sanders has his shot stolen from him and Trump prevails. People are pissed off about the Sanders situation but nothing really comes of it. At this point times have been rocky but the establishment is still holding true to the course. Any claims of fuckery that arise are dismissed as tinfoil-hattery. Business as usual. Meanwhile, Trump is picking up momentum.</p>

<p>Enter CTR. Topics like Trump or anything related to Clinton&#39;s fuckery are stamped down. There is an obvious concerted effort to push the &quot;Clinton Corruption&quot; narrative, internet-wide, to the outer reaches. <a href="/r/Conspiracy">/r/Conspiracy</a> is flooded with Trump supporters who have nowhere else to post other than <a href="/r/The_Donald">/r/The_Donald</a>. This phenomenon is repeated across the social media spectrum.</p>

<p>So then the Podesta Emails start coming out, people are engaged. This is when there seems to be a shift.</p>

<p>Assange loses communications and people take notice. The emails keep coming out. But it&#39;s almost too much too fast. None of it is really taking hold. Small pieces are getting MSM coverage and leading to action but for the most part it&#39;s just too much to digest. </p>

<p>As the Podesta Emails continue to trickle out WeinerGate emerges. (Keep in mind Wikileaks&#39; founder Assange&#39;s well-being is still a mystery.) So the previously complicit Comey re-opened the Clinton email investigation and basically sings it from the mountain top. On Twitter a previously dormant FBI account begins dumping information on FOIA requests and old cases. This just days before the election.</p>

<p>This is VERY odd behavior for Comey for a few reasons. 
1. He basically cleared Clinton of wrongdoing in front of Congress.
2. He stands to lose everything. Obama could fire him or if Clinton wins he is most assuredly out of a job.
But he doesn&#39;t get fired. The media blasts him for it, but he keeps his job. This leads me to believe he might actually have something. 
3. He could have very easily swept it under the rug or buried it in red tape.</p>

<p>Now let&#39;s take a look at the current state of things. Every day, multiple times a day sometimes, new theories are emerging from obscure sources making outlandish and outrageous claims. Websites like True Pundit are making sensationalist claims about pedophilia rings and drone attacks on Assange. Trump gets accused of having a secret server to communicate with the Russians and the evidence for this was supposedly confirmed by leading experts, yet no charges are filed, the FBI even said they have no evidence of it. The stories are multiplying and getting more and more outrageous. Everyday, more noise.</p>

<p>This is PsyOps 101. If you can&#39;t deny it and make it go away then flood the public with nonsensical bullshit. Either they will just dismiss the thing you are trying to hide as conspiratorial nonsense, because so many other things are floating around, or it will just get lost in the shuffle. Throw in a few red herrings and false flags, problem solved. It&#39;s clear to me we are being bombarded with disinformation in an attempt to cover something up. Someone, somewhere, got too close.</p>

<p>A theory keeps emerging about trouble in paradise. The NWO Globalists (HRC &amp; Co.) are at war with the Big Government Bureaucrats (FBI &amp; The other Alphabet Boys). This theory makes a lot of sense as these two entities are, by design, natural enemies. (The theory comes to us, in part, from a post on 4chan about 4 months previous by a user claiming to be FBI.) This is one plausible explanation as it kind of explains the odd behavior of the FBI.</p>

<p>I&#39;m very interested to hear other people&#39;s take on this. But please, if you take nothing else from what I have written take this, try not to get caught up the drama and don&#39;t be fooled by disinformation. The truth is there for us if we dig hard enough.</p>

<p>My hope is just that this apparent power struggle we are seeing is actually genuine... Although part of me fears this may all just be a part of tptb plan, and they&#39;re either intentionally canning Hillary to give everyone the impression of a victory in which they&#39;d just put someone else in her place OR trying to propagate so much controversy and scandal if she wins that this country tears itself a part from within (both of which would fit the supposed zionist agenda, as well as their methods). </p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>It&#39;s not odd at all.  It&#39;s very easy to explain.  Comey is trying to do whatever he thinks will save his own neck.  At first, that looked like supporting Hillary, but then things changed and his staff revolted, so he changed with them.</p>

<p>The mid and lower level rats are taking note of the explosions and are starting to realise that the proverbial ship of State is definitely going to sink.  As a result, many of them are now scurrying around in a mad attempt to find out how to save themselves.</p>

<p>Leakers are just early adopters.  They are the advance wave.  The majority of sycophants in any court will remain loyal to their master until it becomes incontrovertibly clear, that said loyalty is no longer conducive to their own survival; as a desire for survival is, in many cases, the only thing motivating said sycophancy in the first place.</p>

<p>Yes, the FBI will revolt.  Yes, even hardened spooks in the CIA or NSA are going to start looking around nervously.  You are witnessing the beginnings of a chain reaction.  The more people defect, the more the regime becomes endangered; and the more the regime becomes endangered, the more people will defect.  It is a positive, self-reinforcing spiral.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>A new hope. </p>

<p>As a reader of many subjects and as someone that is fascinated with conspiracy theories and alternate explanations, it really seems to me that I&#39;ve seen enough evidence of freemasonry, disinformation, coding, and black magic in the past month to know for myself to a fact that the world is a theater.  </p>

<p>Everything to me is pointing to a battle of light and dark at such a subtle esoteric level that people that haven&#39;t broken the interest will never recognize it.  </p>

<p>I realize that this is subjective and a very limited perspective, but I pride myself at recognizing systems in place and the average psyche of an everyday American is built by design to create fear of questioning what were convinced to be true.</p>

<p>All of this backlash happening so quickly is all the verification I need from now on to keep my eyes open always.  If something is easy to take for granted then look at it deeper.  We need to stop living in ideology and start living in reality and the reality is that we only know what we individually encounter.  </p>

<p>We encounter almost nothing in the name of truth because the world is created based on what people think they know. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ya, the free masons as we know them aren&#39;t these people. That&#39;s part of the illusion.</p>

<p>That being said, I think they were probably at one time a faction within the masons. The 2 groups have similar mythos and rituals.</p>

<p>90% of typical run of the mill masons probably dream of Jesus at night from what I know. Jews, muslims, wiccans, and on make up the rest. </p>

<p>Other than that I mostly agree. </p>

<p>I think that we have to rely on the individual perspective and trust that most people really don&#39;t want to do bad things whether they are complicit or not. </p>

</blockquote>

<p>That&#39;s the punchline.  There is no fight between light and dark.  The darkness has already lost.  All it is currently doing is acting out the final stages of its&#39; resistance to that fact.</p>

<p>I used to think we were fucked, but then I started really paying attention; although of course, the psychedelics helped, too.</p>

<p>If humanity was losing, though, we wouldn&#39;t be seeing the things that we are.  We wouldn&#39;t be seeing this kind of chain reaction breakdown of the government.  We wouldn&#39;t be seeing the exposure of all their dirty laundry.</p>

<p>During my last acid trip, one of the things that was repeatedly emphasised, was the fact that we are going into a time where there will be <strong><em>no</em></strong> secrets, of any kind whatsoever.  Secrecy is going.  Privacy in a sense is going, although there will still be respect for the fact that sometimes, people want minimal noise and stimulation.</p>

<p>They are also still fucking it up with the &quot;unity&quot; meme.  They think that that means coercive or enslaving world government.  It doesn&#39;t.  What it really means is simply a falling away of the old governmental skeleton to the point where no one thinks or cares about it any more.  We will organise in our own way, and we will do it <strong><em>ourselves.</em></strong></p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have a theory about FBIanon. </p>

<p>He said a lot of things, some solid and some outlandish. Some of his points I find hard to wrap my mind around. For example the pedophilia ring and child trafficking. It would literally take but a few seconds of video to blow that shit wide open. Just the smallest shred of a clip of video showing some big name politician being inappropriate with a child would rip the whole thing apart.</p>

<p>But a lot of his other points, indeed most of what he said I found very credible. His mannerisms and speech patterns, just the whole experience seemed legit to me. Call it intuition.</p>

<p>So then we must ask ourselves, what about this pedophile story. Could there really be such a thing in our government? Could such a thing exist in a surveillance state as we have today? The FBI being masters of surveillance would certainly have some definitive proof and it would have leaked somehow by now. Surely this can&#39;t be true, it doesn&#39;t make sense. So does this mean the whole thing was fake? A very well executed and elaborate troll?</p>

<p>There is another explanation that does make sense. Perhaps he was giving just enough disinformation as to not blip the radar. If he is who he says he is then he would likely know how the alphabet boys monitor internet traffic. What if what he was saying was mostly true but he had to include something ridiculous and way out in left field so that anyone watching wouldn&#39;t think he was actual FBI? If he really was worried for his life, it would make sense to take such precautions.</p>

<p>Another point that kind of adds validity to this theory was the general focus of the whole thing. He said himself several times throughout and again at the end that his primary goal was to get people focused on the foundation. He kept reiterating it. Perhaps he figured that even if they investigated the pedophilia claims they would eventually uncover the true nature of the beast.</p>

<p>Just my thoughts on it.</p>

<p>Sanders has his shot stolen from him and Trump prevails.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Make no mistake, the GOP tried pretty damn hard to steal it from Trump too.</p>

<p>Don&#39;t forget, in the primaries the question was never: &quot;is trump ahead of his competition&quot; the question was: &quot;is trump gonna get enough delegates that they can&#39;t contest it&quot;</p>

<p>There wasn&#39;t even a primary at all in Colorado, they just decided to give all the delegates to Cruz without anyone voting. Kasich had no chance in hell of winning the primary, nor of winning in a contested convention. He stayed in the race for the sole purpose of sucking up delegates to keep trump from hitting the threshold.</p>

<p>Rubio only stayed in the race as long as he did in order to win Florida, which was made winner take all only that year because the GOP assumed he&#39;d win it. That backfired when Trump beat him in his own state.</p>

<p>No they aren&#39;t.  Politicians need to try to convince the public of something before they do it.  Military/ Intelligence are used to just doing things covertly.  They don&#39;t care what people think- they just don&#39;t want to get caught.  Many politicians are also intelligence operatives, but at least politcians feel the need to justify their actions and realize that they MIGHT be held accountable. </p>

<p>The military is used to power through the barrel of a gun.  When all you have is hammers, everything looks like a nail.  You DO NOT WANT a military takeover of government.</p>

<p>The methods, philosophies, and goals of politicians are very different than that of law enforcement, military, and intelligence agencies. This makes them incompatible in many ways and they often fail to see things eye to eye. That being said they do operate in a kind of symbiosis due to necessity.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>One of the biggest arguments against globalism IS the bureaucracy.  I don&#39;t see how the intelligence and military guys you&#39;re referring to would believe they&#39;d be out of a job in a larger global bureaucracy.  I think anyone involved in military and intelligence who opposed certain groups in government, just don&#39;t like the way they&#39;re doing things.</p>

<p>BUT, whereas many of us here are opposed to the war machine (military industrial complex) that obviously dictates our foreign policy- we&#39;re talking about people who are even MORE hawkish.  Half the anti-hillary commercials i see on television think that the democrats aren&#39;t hawkish ENOUGH in regards to syria and Iran and the completely invented jihadi movement represented by &quot;ISIS&quot;.  If there is a large cabal within the FBI/ CIA/ DARPA who wants Hillary out- they&#39;re even scarier than she is. </p>

<p>But I don&#39;t think that&#39;s what we&#39;re looking at.  I think we&#39;re getting indundated with disinfo to see how far they can push us.  I think you&#39;re watching a hazing ritual so when Hillary gets in, the country is equally divided on her and she has an excuse to push neocon policies while pretending she&#39;s a liberal.</p>

<p>Through my observations I have noticed the waters getting muddier and muddier. This may just be a natural progression as we near the end of a tumultuous election. It may also be intentional. Only time will tell. But, if it is intentional, I believe it is being done to distract the public from something.

<p>That&#39;s just a theory.  But I&#39;m just saying that what Dr. Doom from the alex jones show is spinning- an intelligence cabal looking to overthrow the democratic government and install a military junta- that&#39;s not what you&#39;re seeing from Comey.  BUT that probably DOES exist in a continuity of government plan.  When the people get to out of sorts there are a lot of shady groups who will look to take advantage and get power.</p>

<p>but pieschenik isn&#39;t a bircher or ron paul conservative- he&#39;s a psyops spy cut from the same cloth as kissinger, who says anything he needs to to resonate with the alex jones crowd.  he&#39;ll never give evidence of anything, but he&#39;ll talk big an always glorify the idea that trusting some shady intelligence cabal promoting a coup is a good solution to a corrupt and tyrannical government.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>One flaw that I see. </p>

<p>It is now out in the open that ISIS was created, funded, and armed by TPTB.</p>

<p>It&#39;s in the Podesta emails. You can bet it&#39;s in the others. </p>

<p>Whenever someone even thinks of mentioning ISIS in my presence, I calmly explain all this to them including how MSM calls them ISIS when we want them to be portrayed in one light and when we want to support their operations we call them rebels. It&#39;s all about oil, so it&#39;s easy for them to grasp once you&#39;ve explained the Assad and Russia connections.</p>

<p>Any questions after that, (which I rarely get these days, everyone now knows what wars for oil are) is easily subdued by pointing out the old American jungle camouflage patterns they wear. They&#39;ve shown them marching on TV in these uniforms so often that everyone nods and you can see the wheels turn. Now they are showing up wearing newer digicamo fatigues that we&#39;re phasing out. </p>

<p>yes.</p>

<p>there&#39;s no way this is true, without seriously spinning the words in a leak.  Nobody would admit to that ever, especially not in a written document.  You might say &quot;our policies created an environment conducive to extremism&quot;...  But you&#39;ll never see people talking about intentionally funding ISIS (doesn&#39;t mean they aren&#39;t).</p>

<p>it&#39;s not ALL about energy- but that&#39;s a huge part.  It&#39;s about the path to persia and limiting the influence of asiatic russian on western europe (Germany in particular).  In that way, it&#39;s about stopping Russian and Iranian LNG from getting to where it&#39;s trying to go.  It&#39;s also about sewing chaos in the middle east to keep an African/ Arab union from growing and challenging our resource colonies. In that way, the Sunni vs Shia and fomented extremism is very similar to the left/ right dichotomy being pushed so hard in the US and EU, currently.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is an interesting perspective.</p>

<p>On the MSM I don&#39;t really see any dump of disinformation. The same basic narrative is being played out. Don&#39;t vote for Trump, Trump is bad man. Vote Hillary, she is better than bad man. </p>

<p>Could be that the rats in the media will be the last to know because they are the last in the chain to be fed their storyline. The guy at the end of the media chain is just trying to live paycheck to paycheck and his willingness to support (or not investigate) a legitimate story line is dependant on keeping the fridge with a bit of food, the rent paid and the lights on.</p>

<p>The two police offices shot in Iowa doesn&#39;t seem to be a big enough false flag. Could it be that a diminished narrative machine could only pull off such a minor event?</p>

<p>I&#39;m always hopeful that Americans will stand for the right cause and for personal liberties. It is my hope and prayers that those in the intelligence agencies are coming to the conclusion that these liberties are the right of all men and women, not a select few.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I not under any illusions that there is a benevolent leader in our future, but hopelessness is more debilitating than pure naivety and is exactly how TPTB want you to feel. So here&#39;s my take. </p>

<p>We are witnessing a third party stepping in on to the stage. Second party really, or new faction, or however you want to view it. </p>

<p>The &quot;technology faction&quot; or the &quot;Internet party&quot;. </p>

<p>This was a carefully planned and executed coup of the electoral process coinciding with the coup in government agencies to overthrow the cabals that have held power in check for so long, trading it back and forth between those they choose. </p>

<p>Trump was picked as face man for a number of reasons; He had the money to publically fund himself and not give away who was backing him, celebrity that helped obscure how he could be so &quot;popular&quot; when nobody liked him and both parties were poised against him (even crossing the party line once the primaries were over was not out of the question for the most corrupt), direct ties to the old fbi, personal distaste and reasoning for wanting the house of cards to tumble, etc. He kept winning and advancing even though nobody understood how. </p>

<p>Thiel holds Trump&#39;s &quot;all seeing eye&quot; and explains how he knew what was coming over a year ago. &quot;Anonymous&quot; is exactly who they have always claimed to be, the disenfranchised, the revolutionaries, and the reformists within the government and intelligence communities and others including the FBI, CIA, etc. Through use of social media, meme posts like the Bain memes, and other obscured channels they communicated between the different groups and with wikileaks. </p>

<p>This is my current take of unfolding events in a nutshell. If you have any questions as to how I came to these conclusions or would like further extrapolation of any part I would be happy to share, but most of it has been posted in this sub already anyway and the few parts I have gained from personal sources are extremely well sourced but minor details. </p>

<p>There is lots of hope here brothers and sisters. Not hope in a form that anyone would call utopia, because we are in for a really rough ride economically no matter what happens as we try to dig ourselves out of the hole they have shoved us down. Hope in the form of a new party that has decimated both parties systematically over the course of this election. Hope for the patriots of this war that are fighting to expose corruption and preempt the oncoming civil war that is inevitable in the powder keg of a condition that has been created for us. The people are waking, the dissonance is in place and recognition of our enemies tactics has everyone more skeptical than ever, which is good. </p>

<p>Dig deep, stay skeptical to everything and everyone including my espoused views as I am as susceptible to trickery as any of you in my own ways, but don&#39;t lose hope. It&#39;s all we have, and the only way we will ever win.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I did too. </p>

<p>At first I think it was the novelty of a TV celeb running for president that had the media&#39;s attention. He&#39;s easy ratings and entertainment when everyone else is being boring and predictable.</p>

<p>Again, I think his reasonable deniability of having backers was part of the ploy to trick TPTB into believing that he posed little to no threat which they would love to run Clinton against because they knew going in what a hard sell she would be against the other candidates. </p>

<p>So Clinton campaign phones media buddies and has him pumped up as leading in the republican polls which i highly doubt. Then after primaries the real smear campaign starts, Bush&#39;s cross the aisle and the American public are expected to fall in line, but it was too late. They had already fallen for the honey-pot and the opposition just had to wait until it was too late to replace her to strike the killing blow.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yep, that&#39;s exactly what I currently think. </p>

<p>Trump&#39;s post from over a year ago talking about Huma having the emails and that Weiner will tell the world, the way his information was a step ahead of the game at every turn, the comments made by anon and wiki, everything points to a concerted effort or conspiracy to overthrow TPTB and bring rise to a new faction that holds our Internet freedom and encryption at the core of their values. </p>

<p>And now we have videos from Pieczenik telling us that coups and counter-coups are currently underway within the major branches of the govt. </p>

<p>And then there was Trump&#39;s speach reflecting JFKs final speech, eluding to world conspiracy and toppling it with the help of the people. </p>

<p>These things don&#39;t just happen. They are orchestrated. They know how deep this goes and the need for secrecy in order to pull it off successfully. They also understand the need for public approval. They have been completely and unalteringly confident in their knowledge and ability to sway the public to their side the entire time. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think your observations are true. It&#39;s important that we are aware of what we are facing and don&#39;t stray away because it sounds too &quot;movie script&quot; or outlandish. This is real, the corruption going on and what is hidden from us would put most movies to shame. The truth of our reality will always be more strange, bizarre, and interesting than any sci-fi. </p>

<p>I think there are multiple factions within the FBI/CIA. These organizations are purely one way or the other. There are several world factions of &quot;cabal&quot; types, and the Clintons are part of one of these factions. They have people everywhere, in every notable organization. They most likely are aligned with the Bush family as well as the Rockefellers. These people have been creating war and manipulating the world for a very long time, and that is a truth we must face and accept in order to move on and handle it in the best way possible. </p>

<p>So we see the surface of what appears to be an inner struggle within the FBI and various parts of the US Government. There are people in the government fighting for what is right, and that is important for us to remember going forward. There are also people who are fighting for themselves, and that is also important for us when making calculations. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The camouflage patterns on military uniforms are specific to the country they are made for and the environment of operations. </p>

<p>For example, US military swapped their jungle camouflage for desert camo when desert ops were incoming. </p>

<p>Wouldn&#39;t it be kinda funny to see an army marching through the desert in jungle camo? Well, that&#39;s exactly what we see in many cases when ISIS is portrayed on MSM. And now </p>

<p>Your right about the rest. Though there is the money trail that goes indirectly, almost straight to ISIS via proxy &quot;allies&quot;. People are very aware of that.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You might like this one too. I found it hilarious. Plausible deniability built right in. Over and over. Almost like they want to convince us. Think it&#39;s because our military personnel have already been wondering?</p>

<p>Why would they want to keep upgrading to our cast-offs if they&#39;re having them made?  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ya, the free masons as we know them aren&#39;t these people. That&#39;s part of the illusion.</p>

<p>That being said, I think they were probably at one time a faction within the masons. The 2 groups have similar mythos and rituals.</p>

<p>90% of typical run of the mill masons probably dream of Jesus at night from what I know. Jews, muslims, wiccans, and on make up the rest. </p>

<p>Other than that I mostly agree. </p>

<p>I think that we have to rely on the individual perspective and trust that most people really don&#39;t want to do bad things whether they are complicit or not. </p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>Everything to me is pointing to a battle of light and dark at such a subtle esoteric level that people that haven&#39;t broken the interest will never recognize it. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>That&#39;s the punchline.  There is no fight between light and dark.  The darkness has already lost.  All it is currently doing is acting out the final stages of its&#39; resistance to that fact.</p>

<p>I used to think we were fucked, but then I started really paying attention; although of course, the psychedelics helped, too.</p>

<p>If humanity was losing, though, we wouldn&#39;t be seeing the things that we are.  We wouldn&#39;t be seeing this kind of chain reaction breakdown of the government.  We wouldn&#39;t be seeing the exposure of all their dirty laundry.</p>

<p>During my last acid trip, one of the things that was repeatedly emphasised, was the fact that we are going into a time where there will be <strong><em>no</em></strong> secrets, of any kind whatsoever.  Secrecy is going.  Privacy in a sense is going, although there will still be respect for the fact that sometimes, people want minimal noise and stimulation.</p>

<p>They are also still fucking it up with the &quot;unity&quot; meme.  They think that that means coercive or enslaving world government.  It doesn&#39;t.  What it really means is simply a falling away of the old governmental skeleton to the point where no one thinks or cares about it any more.  We will organise in our own way, and we will do it <strong><em>ourselves.</em></strong></p>
