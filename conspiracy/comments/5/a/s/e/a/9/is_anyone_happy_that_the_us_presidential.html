There&#39;s a lot of alt political news which barely seeped through mean time like South Korean Political Scandal. And where are the more exotic conspiracy news like aliens and paranormal?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree, no matter who gets elected, we are looking at trouble. </p>

<p>If Shillary gets elected, and the FBI continues to conduct their investigation, we are looking at a mess. Not to mention the Pro-Trump Militias that have already started admitting they won&#39;t go quietly into the night under a Clinton presidency.</p>

<p>If Trump gets elected, the minorities, the BLM movement, as well as left will be just as pissed, though probably not as armed and dangerous. </p>

<p>Just read a funny, albeit terrifying Cracked article about the possibility of a 2nd US civil war.... the funny part being that it&#39;s not that far off or crazy of an idea.</p>

<p>With minimul civilian violence and unrest, we could easily see our country spiral out of control in the next 12 months. </p>

<p>It&#39;s sad people, be safe friends, look out for each other. Don&#39;t turn on each other when it really hits the fan.</p>
