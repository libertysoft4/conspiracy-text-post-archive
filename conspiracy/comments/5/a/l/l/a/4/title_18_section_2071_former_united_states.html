<blockquote>
<p>Apparently, the FBI forgot to visit the Cornell Law Library. Word for word from the Cornell Law Library Former United States Attorney General Michael Mukasey tells MSNBC that not only is Hillary Clinton&#39;s private email server illegal, it &quot;disqualifies&quot; her from holding any federal office. Very specifically points to one federal law, Title 18. Section 2071.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>For those of us who do not have United States Code committed to memory, here&#39;s what it says:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“(a) Whoever willfully and unlawfully conceals, removes, mutilates, obliterates, or destroys, or attempts to do so, or, with intent to do so takes and carries away any record, proceeding, map, book, paper, document, or other thing, filed or deposited with any clerk or officer of any court of the United States, or in any public office, or with any judicial or public officer of the United States, shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than three years, or both. (b) Whoever, having the custody of any such record, proceeding, map, book, document, paper, or other thing, willfully and unlawfully conceals, removes, mutilates, obliterates, falsifies, or destroys the same, shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than three years, or both; and shall forfeit his office and be disqualified from holding any office under the United States. As used in this subsection, the term “office” does not include the office held by any person as a retired officer of the Armed Forces of the United States.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes, it explicitly states &quot;shall forfeit his office and be disqualified from holding any office under the United States.</p>

<p><strong>Shouldn&#39;t voters know that? The media won&#39;t tell them. So it&#39;s up to us.
Post this everywhere</strong></p>

    <div class="md"><p>Look..</p>

<p>I can see that angle.</p>

<p>But they are efficient...in undermining Western civilization.  There is a culture clash of biblical proportions coming between the West and Islam.  It will only be expedited with her at the helm.  From what I can see, they want it to happen.  They also seem to be moving pieces in a way that suggest martial law will become a reality.  These are very scary people with almost unchecked power.  20 years from now, people may look back on this time as the only chance they had to deny total government rule.  Trump&#39;s shortcomings literally have no bearing on anything.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>it&#39;s interesting.  I see Trump&#39;s appeal as an apocalyptic candidate to blow up the system, although I maintain he&#39;s a complete fraud (a life-long New York democrat pretending to appeal to our most atavistic human natures for the means of gaining power)</p>

<p>I wonder though... The Federal gov&#39;t has complete authority to declare martial law, enacted post 9/11 &amp; likely justifiable using civil war precedent.  So the theory say they fuel terrorism as a means towards eventual world domination.  But is it so out of the question to say that the conflict between the West and Islam is infinite?  It has gone on forever and will continue forever.  Maybe the potential authoritarianism of our laws is a response potential cells unchecked and unexpected... is it a check on us?  the conspiracy thinkers .. or is it a check on the terrorist?  The Establishment is real, but sometimes I wonder if it&#39;s realistic to think it has a common goal, rather then a bunch of individual interest working under one common system (capitalism and federalism)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The problem with the equation is that one side is increasingly displaced and dedicated to the destruction of the other, while the other is comfortably resting, wasting the days away on video games and iphones.  You can see the overwhelming nature of Islam taking shape in Europe and it is a terrifying reality that seems to be shaping up.</p>

<p>The establishment most definitely cannot be one universal group.  There have to be multiple factions, otherwise reality would look different.  In the end, it comes down to good vs. evil, and good vs. good, and evil vs. evil, and ambiguous vs. each, etc.  </p>

<p>Regardless of their insight or power, there are fundamental characteristics of living beings that govern interactions and it is those characteristics (and the underlying and overlaying beliefs and intentions) that all but ensure division.  </p>

<p>When it comes down to it, though, I can imagine that everything we see and experience boils down to one side wanting to rule the other.  Those sides may have split into different factions and there may be various forms of referees and allied combatants, but in the end, chess is a 2 player game.  </p>

<p>re: messaging, the message in the US is absolutely just as blatant as it is in Russia.  The control (which is lacking) is what they seek to achieve by ensuring continuity of the ruling class and subsequently seizing all weapons.  If ever the US citizenry is robbed of their right to bear arms, the world will proceed smoothly into a comfortable, irretrievable one world government.  </p>

Clearly there is a problem, and I think the FBI (with other intelligence services weighing in), may have come to the conclusion that they are risking a high probability of some kind of revolt/revolution/civil disobedience on a scale they may not be so comfortable with. Are the intelligence services so separated from TPTB? I can&#39;t answer that one, I am only a casual observer of things and try and find meaning in why certain things happen.</p>

<h1>WAIT!</h1>

<p>So we&#39;re going to take the Constitution SERIOUSLY now?</p>

<p>Are we going to start saying that laws that were passed that violate or contradict the Constitution are INVALID?</p>

<p>Well, I&#39;m perfectly okay with that. </p>

<p>You can kiss ~ 3/4 of the Federal Government and its agencies and their &#39;regulations&#39; goodbye in the process - but hey, if they were unconstitutional in the FIRST PLACE, so be it.</p>

<p>Bye bye DEA, FDA, EPA, and countless other unconstitutional Federal agencies. Bon voyage!</p>

<p>Criminal or not, being a &quot;natural born citizen&quot; and &quot;at least 35 years of age&quot; (x 2) Clinton is &quot;qualified&quot; as per Constitutional verbiage. </p>

<p>That does NOT mean, however, that she should (or will) be ELECTED.</p>

<p>But beware that Constitutional can of worms - if you open it, the Federal Government will largely disappear.</p>

<p>And that is as it should be.</p>

<p>Don&#39;t like it? AMEND the fucking Constitution.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Article II, Section 2 of the Constitution. Under the Constitution, the President’s clemency power extends only to federal criminal offenses</p>

<p>All requests for executive clemency for federal offenses are directed to the Pardon Attorney for investigation and review. The Pardon Attorney prepares the Department&#39;s recommendation to the President for final disposition of each application. Executive clemency may take several forms, including pardon, commutation of sentence, remission of fine or restitution, and reprieve.</p>

<p>Robert A. Zauzmer was named Acting Pardon Attorney on February 1, 2016 and then appointed by the Attorney General as Pardon Attorney on Monday, September 26, 2016.</p>

<p>ALL HANDS ON DECK Can I get some help with this guys? I&#39;m slammed with School/Work for the next several day, but I will spend every free moment researching this.</p>

<p>Robert A. Zauzmer Need background info on this guy </p>

<p>Can Hillary be charged with a Non-federal offense to circumvent the presidents pardoning privilege?</p>

<p>Any additional relevant criteria that can be used?</p>

<p>I will reach out and get some exposure on this if we can build a solid case.</p>
