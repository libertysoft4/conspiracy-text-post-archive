    <div class="md"><p>I wish you could of borrowed my eyes for one night.</p>

<p>This event occurred in 2011 and has haunted me everyday since. I work in networking and all of ours are late. I usually get off around 2am and then I am up for a few hours before I go to bed. This evening I got off work and it was raining really bad on my way home. When I got home, by chance, the clouds broke and I stepped outside to have a quick smoke. One of my buddies called me and we were chatting about work. It was still not raining and there were low lying clouds. There are orange street lights in Allen and they were reflecting off the bottom of the clouds creating an artificial light. There was a pretty good breeze whipping around, but no rain. I was facing the west and I look to my right and I see a black cube moving out of the north and traveling south at about 60-80mph. It was moving with a corner forward. This thing was huge. I was astonished to the core of my soul. I sat speechless for a few seconds knowing that I was seeing something amazing. It was 80-100ft tall. It was a black cube in shape and looked like a rough stone surface. On the side of the cube was a border and within the border was a circular symbol, if that&#39;s what it even was. It looked like if you were to draw a circular maze. It was disturbing the air behind it and created a vaporous trail spinning behind it and then disappearing. There was absolutely no sound. None. If you know Dallas, it was traveling in the direction of southbound 75Central Expressway towards downtown. I told my buddy what I had seen and he lives a few miles south. I fumbled over my words telling him and asked him to go outside to see if he could see it. He went out to the middle of his street and looked in the direction that it was coming from. After about 5 minutes it started to rain again. He stood out in the rain for another 15 minutes but never saw it. Good friend..lol.. Anyways, no one can ever tell me that I didn&#39;t see what I saw that night. I have been ridiculed and laughed at, but I know what I saw. It is almost a relief at this point to know that they are really here. I have been a long time lurker and I had to get this off of my chest. I have been searching &quot;black cube ufo&quot; for years now, every single day. I cannot stop thinking about it. I have to see it again. Thanks for listening. edit:Allen, TX (near Dallas) edit: It was below the clouds. It looked like the entire cube was carved from a single stone. It had a border along its edges and a circular pattern in the middle. Think of a view of a circular maze from above. Also of interesting note, no lights from the craft either. I was expecting a light show, but I will settle with what I got to witness any day.</p>

<p>Personally, I have never, and will never believe the bullshit that Snopes spews, which is why I addressed it was simply an avenue that most source picketing people accept as credible.</p>

<p>May I ask in what manner you mean the variables can&#39;t be known? If you&#39;re stating that there&#39;s no end point to scale probability off of, then yes I agree. It isn&#39;t evidence in the terms of something 100%. If you&#39;re familiar with Drake&#39;s Equation I am interested to know, evidence aside, if you believe there are intelligent ETs</p>

<p>We can’t know how many worlds exist, the habitability thereof, or even the probability of the occurrence of life within conditions that match ours. We have ONE data point. You can’t make any assumptions from that.</p>

<p>We may not know how many worlds exist, but we can say based off of people with a far higher education on these things, that there&#39;s billions in the Milky Way alone.  </p>

<p>Ah, fuck; it was in an old thread that has been wiped now, I think. I’ll try to find the confirmation again.</p>

<p>Earth! Of all the planets we know exist, and of all the ones we know exist that are like ours, we only have one with life. Any overarching supposition is nothing but conjecture (and without FTL, we’ll <em>never</em> know about anything outside our Local Group).</p>

<p>I figured that was the case, <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/science/space/11049504/Sea-plankton-found-living-outside-International-Space-Station.html">we have evidence of life outside of this planet.</a>
Also, we know for sure that <a href="http://www.space.com/30502-mars-giant-ice-sheet-discovery-mro.html">there&#39;s ice on mars, providing very high odds that there&#39;s microscopic life therein, we just haven&#39;t been able to get a sample.</a> Also, we don&#39;t know those other planets don&#39;t have life, only that it&#39;s not visible and we don&#39;t have the technology at this point to get the information we need. So even in that, we can&#39;t truly say anything about the planets around ourselves outside of the moon, and mars.</p>

What we would learn from another civilization not of this planet would change humanity forever. We need to be brave, willing to learn, and take constructive criticism. If another species has the technology to travel here they would sure have the technology to destroy us if that was their intent and guess what. We&#39;re still here.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I doubt we are told or taught the real history of humans on our planet..as you said the acknowledgment of extraterrestrial civilizations would probably be to hard a pill for most to swallow..i mean there is more evidence to suggest there was a globally connected civilization thousands of years ago that just seems to of stop existing its obvious to anyone that can think for themselves but why is that suppressed?..to many questions and no clear answers when comes to disclosing anything that is contrary to what we are told is the truth. honestly when comes down to it...its just fear...we fear what we do not understand..its that simple..</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes exactly. Man is fed a staple diet of fear and it&#39;s getting old. Thankfully positive change is coming. </p>

<p>One thing I would love is to actually be able to look at a timeline, a truly, 100% accurate timeline of the whole history of the earth and its inhabitants. </p>

<p>So many ancient civilizations that are written about in today&#39;s history&#39;s books are written off as &quot;primitive&quot;, &quot;crude&quot; etc when in reality they were so far ahead of us in technology, culture, society, spirituality, and its balance with nature.</p>

<p>There is so much rich history to be found and shared and spread but it is suppressed.</p>

<p>Thankfully it&#39;s changing and truth is coming to light.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ll speak as someone who doesn&#39;t necessarily brush it off, but still questions it and is not completely convinced. First off I do believe aliens exist, just not that we have had any contact with them. Our solar system is unimaginably large, the galaxy even more so and their are billions of galaxies. The possibility that their is some other forms of intelligent life are probably large, however the possibility that they have the technology required to travel those distances or even that there will ever be the technology to travel those distances in my opinion is small. </p>

<p>Yes we have accounts of alien encounters all the time but I think those can be attributed to several different factors I.e government testing new tech, drugs, attention seekers and also just plain crazy people. </p>

<p>I&#39;m not saying they don&#39;t exist, and maybe we have had contact with them. I just find it very hard to believe a more advanced possibly more intelligent being has made contact with us and only a select few people can actually confirm it. </p>

<p>There are countless positively aligned species of aliens that would love open contact with us.</p>

<p>There are actually alien consciousness that is being channeled in this day and age.</p>

<p>One popular example is Bashar channeled by Daryl.</p>

<p>Extraterrestrial life would love us to realize their presence.</p>

<p>edit: not sure if it&#39;s fear. that would be a good reason, it could also make them question the fact that there is intelligent life elsewhere &amp; maybe even start debate about religion/God, it could get deep. my guess is most don&#39;t wanna go there.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>See that&#39;s the problem is the social stigma. It&#39;s interesting how stigmatized it is and by being so, it makes it even harder to hear the people talk about their experiences that actually happened.. So much information just waiting to be told..</p>

<p>I think it&#39;s a mixture of the general public not being ready for alien disclosure, and maybe we are slowly acclimating to UFOs and aliens with their subliminal presence on most popular entertainment and media.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>but i think the public <em>is</em> ready. imo, it&#39;s TPTB that refuse disclosure. it would mean giving up info &amp; possibly knowledge that could be beneficial, which i&#39;m sure they don&#39;t want to reveal. </p>

<p>i doubt we can expect full disclosure, more than likely it may be something similar to Project Blue Beam to continue control. </p>

<p>Project blue beam has potential of being a legitimate conspiracy but half the things people spout about aliens is complete none sense.</p>

<p>If they wanted to take over earth they would have physically wiped us out eons ago.</p>
