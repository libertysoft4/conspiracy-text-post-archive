    <div class="md"><p>No, there is no chance you can get Bernie. Don&#39;t know if we&#39;ll get Trump, but it all looks to be trending that way.</p>

<p>We, you, me, every American and the rest of the world are all going to be stuck with the consequences of allowing corruption to run rampant under the guise of welfare, social justice, peace, &amp; charity - from all sectors of society.</p>

<p>If you&#39;re not happy about your options, don&#39;t blame the 2 party system, go out in your community &amp; become the catalyst for change that you&#39;d like to see. It&#39;s far far too late to impact this cycle, but, like clockwork, another major election is in 2 years and a presidential election will happen again in 2020 - start voting for and promoting the type of leaders you&#39;d like to see govern now. </p>

<p>Hopefully, overtime, we, as a community &amp; nation, can begin to make amends for and repair the damage from the mess we created through years inaction, lack of oversight, and overall apathy for the role Government plays in our lives.</p>

<p>Good luck.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Okay,  Correct me if i am wrong though as i probably am, but if the DNC was forced to pull Clinton off the ticket due to just too much overall corruption would the nomination not go to the person who had the next largest amount of delegates?  Bernie Sanders son nominated him president at the convention and he received the next most delegates.  In a hypothetical world what would happen to the democratic clinton if there was a video of Hillary literally killing someone, i&#39;m not saying thats happened, but i am wondering what would happen if something that egregious was exposed. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ok, hypothetically and not considering the logistics of changing a party&#39;s nominee before Election Day:</p>

<p>Contingency plans are most likely laid out in the DNC bylaws for, let&#39;s say, an untimely death of the candidate for office. I&#39;m sure they have well established procedures in case of such an event and those procedures should be documented &amp; available to the public/DNC members.</p>

<p>But it&#39;s still a moot point - this is a presidential election and a moment which is taken very seriously by voters, and the largest voter base is the &quot;elderly&quot;.</p>

<p>Ponder for a moment how someone who doesn&#39;t surf Reddit, or the internet for information, would react to your hypothetical situation - maybe that will hold answer your looking for.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve nothing to back up this claim, but I think your typical voter would vote for a horrifying  &amp; terrible familiar face &amp; name over a last-minute stand-in that they know very very little about.</p>

<p>2020, it&#39;ll be here before you know it...or maybe, not at all.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Also I love how CNN is saying that Hillary is doing just fine and these are conspiracy theories.  Mean while they are trying to create a conspiracy of a Russian connection to Trump.  Way less proof out there of that than HRC being a legit white collar criminal. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Their newsfeed algorithms have been filtering undemocratic stories out, but when these headlines start hitting mainstream, which they have already, it&#39;ll be like mainstream media jumping onto the bandwagon. They&#39;re changing their tac.</p>

<p>With such massive implications on our entire way of life and perspective, they would be shunned by their audience when the <a href="http://mobile.wnd.com/2016/11/biggest-scandal-in-u-s-history-about-to-break/">scandal</a> hits mainstream and they ignore it. Those that do not cover the CF scandal will be viewed as an insane person living in their own reality bubble.</p>

<p>These revelations are just the tip of the iceberg though. When everyone is glued to Internet news pages and TV news channels, even bigger revelations will be released - not covered on 4chan - because we as one humanity are causing a giant feedback loop, which will amplify again and again, more truths about us will be published.</p>
