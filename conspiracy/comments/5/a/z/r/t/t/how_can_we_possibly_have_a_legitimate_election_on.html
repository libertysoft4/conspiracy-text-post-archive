        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>We now know the Hiliary/DNC/MSM have all conspired to &quot;elect&quot; Hillary as the Democratic Nominee.
This make her an illegitimate candidate and possibly an illegitimate POTUS.</p>

<p>We also know from the &quot;Pied Piper&quot; emails that HRC and the MSM conspired to promote Trump and only release &quot;good&quot; articles and interviews about him because they felt out of all the RNC candidates he would be the easiest to defeat.</p>

<p>Remember last last summer and fall? You couldn&#39;t get away from Trump in the news. He got way more airtime than any of the other candidates.</p>

<p>So in 4 days we are scheduled to have an election between 2 illegitimate candidates. (I know Jill and Johnson are still out there.. but either of them winning isn&#39;t realistic). Regardless of the outcome of the race - it could be argued that our POTUS is illegitimate... if it stops there we will be lucky. </p>

<p>The POTUS will be impeached and their VP will step in (or maybe the VP will be impeached too and the next in line will step in).</p>

<p>Add in the corruption of the DOJ telling the FBI to stop investigating the Clinton Foundation and the 1st email investigation - and now our whole government is suspect and could be deemed illegitimate.. this is where the wheels fall off.</p>

<p>Other nations could consider our government illegitimate. Individual states could secede (Texas tried a few years ago.. with much less of an argument).</p>

<p>This could get really bad. </p>

<p>I think we need to postpone the elections.</p>

<p>Clinton&#39;s legacy will be how they destroyed our democracy.</p>

<p>Am I smoking too much pot or is this a possible outcome?</p>

<p>BOTH candidates are illegitimate.  What difference will a paper ballot be? ...Unless they are BOTH declared &quot;illegitimate&quot; BEFORE the election. Then it would be Jill Stein and Gary Johnson..</p>

<p>Vote for globalism and the destruction of Americas sovereignty </p>
