<p>EDIT: I just got back from eating, and this thread has gone off the charts. I&#39;m really having trouble keeping up. From here on, I will only be able to reply to comments directly on my own comments, or ones that I am tagged in via &quot;<a href="/u/dataphreak">/u/dataphreak</a>&quot;. In the mean time, it&#39;s time to start digging. We&#39;ve exposed the Dow angle for motive to access the Secretary of State at the time, but there are plenty of other companies and dates. Each one deserves its own thread. Find stuff, post it, tag me in the comments, and I&#39;ll come check it out with you.</p>

<p>Stay safe.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>She&#39;s not an anti-vaxxer, and doesn&#39;t think wifi causes cancer. She&#39;s a doctor, not an idiot. She&#39;s trying to get all the voters she can, surprise, she&#39;s a politician. And many people are too scared of the two party system resulting in the other team winning to actually affect change. So she has to take what she can get. She doesn&#39;t want nuclear plants because of things like Fukushima or Chernobyl. I think climate change is enough of an issue to necessitate nuclear power, but the president is not a dictator. Unless they change the system.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Can&#39;t say I have. I expect Jill will disappear after this election, barring something insane. So it matters less. But other people have presented more detail beyond the usual &quot;wifi causes cancer&quot; complaint I&#39;ve been hearing, and reasonable thoughts about the nuclear energy, which I also understand. I&#39;d rather have someone who wanted to be more careful with nuclear power than less so (as Donald Trump appears to be considering his thoughts about nuclear weapons and Japan and South Korea) and is in favor of a peaceful foreign policy (unlike Hillary Clinton considering the aggression we are seeing toward Russia) and understands the problems of our criminal justice system and climate change, and has plans to fix it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Things like Fukushima and Chernobyl were directly caused by people going against the advice of the engineers and scientists. In Chernobyl they turned off all safety measures and ignored all warning signs, at Fukushima the company which owns the plant were told they should increase the height of the Tsunami wall and move the backup generators to a nearby hill, but that would have cost money and Tsunamis are rare, right? </p>

<p>Furthermore, both those reactors are 1960s vintage, they&#39;re old, and have positive void coefficients, meaning if cooling fails they melt down, modern reactors have negative coefficients, meaning if cooling fails they just generate more electricity for a bit, which is entirely safe. They cannot fail beyond shutting down for a few days.</p>

    <div class="md"><p><a href="/u/AM_JESUS_AMA">/u/AM_JESUS_AMA</a> Never said that Jill Stein thinks wifi causes cancer, they said that she thinks it causes &quot;sickness.&quot; </p>

<p>On wifi Jill Stein said: &quot;A number of scientific studies have raised red flags about possible health effects of WiFi radiation on young children. I do not have a personal opinion that WiFi is or isn&#39;t a health issue for children. There is not enough information to know. I do however believe in science. Scientific research should go forward and find out. Countries including Switzerland, Italy, France, Austria, Luxembourg, Bulgaria, Poland, Hungary, Israel, Russia and China, have banned or restricted these technologies in schools.</p>

<p>These concerns were ignited by a recent National Institutes of Health study that provided some of the strongest evidence to date that exposure to radiation from cell phones and wireless devices is associated with the formation of rare cancers. &quot;</p>

<p>She then links to an article which provides no citations and draws its information from an unpublished, non-peer reviewed paper.</p>

<p>Furthermore, wifi sends out radiowaves, which are just photons of a wavelenth not visible to the human eye, so essentially, she is scared that light causes cancer in children.</p>

<p>Right, just like the armed US revolution against Britain was an end to civilization</p>

<p>You realize the British tried seizing guns and enforcing strict gun control in the years leading up to revolution?</p>

<p>You should ask yourself, whose side would you choose if you lived then? Would you be a loyalist to Britain, the legal ruling government and preserver of status quo, or a traitorous, deplorable tea partier?</p>

<p>the fact that a handful of users went on to leave voicemails on that (already deceased) person&#39;s parent&#39;s telephone is very unfortunate, but CANNOT be used to discredit reddit and/or crowdsourced investigations.</p>

Surely, this is why he&#39;s campaigning with her now: so he can be close in case the hammer&#39;s about to drop. So close that the pardon is probably already written and just waiting for him to sign, so when agents come to cuff her, Obama waves the pardon at them.</p>

<p>The FBI needs to wait until Trump wins because then Obama&#39;s pardon wouldn&#39;t work.

I&#39;m honestly asking, it doesn&#39;t seem like anything that she did really matters besides the fact that she lied about it.  She&#39;s a politician, that&#39;s what they do.

<p>how bad was what she did</p>

<p>People have lost their security clearances for less.  A lot fucking less.  Losing your security clearance cost you your livelihood since generally speaking your skills are all tied to you having a clearance.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I would think if the information was that sensitive it would have some kind encryption</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Exactly this, but to completely understand the duplicity involved, you need to know this fact.  The US Federal Government operates several internet structures, which are completely independent of the internet everyone else uses.  They each have different classification, so you have a SECRET internet access, a TOP SECRET internet access, and some number of CLASSIFIED internet systems which are only relevant for specific areas, ie Afghanistan has it&#39;s own classified internet access (at least it did, don&#39;t know if it is still up and active).  To access these different internets, you have to have a computer, a special connection point (ethernet port), and an account to access the computer.  So you login to the computer, the computer has the correct stuff (protocols and what not) to talk to the classified network, and can communicate securely to the rest of the classified network.</p>

<p>Clinton was bypassing that encryption by having her people access the data from a classified networks, transfer it to a USB drive, and then removing any marks detailing the the clearance level required to view the material.  This gave the impression that everything sent over her server was not classified.  However, removing it from a classified system is still a felony offense and punishable under anti-terror and espionage laws.  </p>

<p>Also, you may have seen or read the term &quot;SAP&quot; (Pronounce each letter, it is not sap like the tree goo).   SAP stands for Special Access Program.  An SAP is not something that anyone with a specific clearance can access.  Even if you have the highest level of security clearance, (TOP SECRET/SENSITIVE COMPARTMENTED INFORMATION) doesn&#39;t mean you have access to everything.  Think of it as being need to know, like our drone program.  The details of our drone program are a heavily guarded secret.  You have to have a need in order to know those details.  They are not given out all willy nilly to any one with a TS/SCI.  Anyways, Clinton had SAP files on her server.  Most people, myself included, just don&#39;t understand how you can have SAP files and not know what they are.  SAP files are an entirely different monster from any other classified material.  Dealing with classified information as long as she has been, she should have immediately recognized them for what they were, and not stored them on a system so easily compromised.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve tried not to editorialize this post so much, and break it down to its simplest terms, but if you have any more questions just let me know.</p>

<p>Also, the thumb drive thing is a logical conclusion.  They could&#39;ve also printed off documents and then retyped them.  Or have taken pictures of the screen.   However, because of how SAP works, which to the best of my knowledge, all SAP files are on their own individual networks completely separate from any other network.

<p>It almost sounds plausible that the files were transfered to a lower security system <em>in order</em> to be hacked and leak / sell the files to whoever hacked them.</p>

<p>Sure, so at the top of every government document it tells you the classification.  By default, 99% of all documents are C:FOUO, which means Classification:  For Official Use Only.  FOUO is some legal bullshittery that means the government can stop you from giving this piece of paper away or punish you if they find out you did it after the fact.  I&#39;ve never heard of Uncle Same doing this, but it&#39;s there if they really want to go after some poor schmuck and have nothing else.  </p>

<p>Classified material will be marked C: SECRET or C: TOP SECRET or C: CENTRIX (Afghanistan specific classification).  </p>

<p>On a memo, which is most communications, this is generally placed in the header area of the document, with the highest form of classification of the document.  Then below in the body of the memo or document, you have paragraphs labeled very specifically with &quot;S&quot; or &quot;TS&quot; off to the side.  These stand for, you guessed it SECRET and TOP SECRET.  HRC was asked about those, and she said she didn&#39;t know what they were.  However, most people know what they are, and if you can&#39;t deduce it you ask.  They are every where, and they stick out.  You don&#39;t miss them.  They are in place because of how classifying documents works.  A document might be marked TS, but the information contained within may be only secret or FOUO.  It&#39;s only when it is all brought together that it becomes a higher tier of clearance. </p>

<p>Also, for images and other non-word documents the classification is even more in your face, since it is color-code.  Green = FOUO, Red = SECRET / TOP SECRET, Purple = CENTRIX.  </p>

<p>Anyways, Team Clinton scrubbed the header marks from memos/docs and deleted the color coding on the other things.  Government email even comes encoded.  If you are using the FOUO system (normal unclassified everyday running of operation system) all your emails are flagged as such.  However, on higher clearance systems, which HRC should have been using for government business, you can set classification label.  So your emails get marked appropriately.  You can talk about things like overthrowing other governments or selling arms to rebels in Africa and flag it as being Top Secret.  HRC&#39;s email system CANNOT have that system in place, since it is literally against the law.  People in the email chain could probably guess they were dealing with classified information, but had no way of knowing for sure.  So, the other people involved could feel free to share this information with any Tom, Dick, or Harry on the street, further jeopardizing US security interests around the globe.  </p>

<p>It&#39;s a mess.</p>

<p>As stupid as this sounds, it&#39;s because she thinks she is above the law.  She has people she need to answer to, so she setup a system where she could communicate with them.  Well she also had a need to conduct business with the government so she combined those two things into the entity she could control, her email server.  It was a convenience thing, but the only reason you would do that is because you don&#39;t think national security protocols would ever apply to you. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>They are supposed to sacrifice themselves for the republic, rather than sacrifice the republic for themselves.  For a President, or someone seeking that office, this is that much truer.  Hillary Clinton has, time and again, sacrificed the Republic for her own gain.  Do you think when she becomes President she will cease aggregating power and money, at the expense of her constituents?  Becoming President is merely a notch on her ambition belt that opens the door to checks with more zeroes on them.  She is using all of us for her own personal gain and it&#39;s sad that some people refuse to believe that because it&#39;s clear as day.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It doesn&#39;t matter if it&#39;s private or political, ambition is ambition.  Especially the way you worded it &quot;a notch on her ambition belt that...for a check with more zeros&quot;. That&#39;s exactly what Trump has been doing for years.  Hell most successful people are ambitious, but some (Clinton and Trump) go to any lengths to do so.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think you are missing the point.  If you go back and read your original post, you describe Clinton as ambitious to the point of not caring what has to be done to gain power.  You say it just another notch on her belt.  The whole thing describes Trump very accurately.  Ambition does not equal money, he&#39;s a business man, she&#39;s a politician.  This doesn&#39;t change the fact that both are ambitious.  He was after money while she was after power.  Now that Trump is also a politician, hes using that same ambition to gain political power just as Clinton does.</p>

It refers to an email which mentions these &quot;for-profit&quot; activities and TYT point to it as the smoking gun. It is the one where they complain Chelsea is asking too many questions about her parent&#39;s activities and they tell Podesta she needs to back off.  What you&#39;ve found is more damning than that email. You should tweet it to Cenk and the team at TYT.</p>

<p>This is the same guy who they blamed as having an &quot;oh shit&quot; moment and used BleachBit to wipe the server after the subpoena had been issued. Supposedly he deleted all that information on his own, with no instructions from anybody else.</p>

<p>And he received immunity from the Department of Justice. Because apparently you just hand that shit out like candy. He was summoned to answer questions in front of a Congressional oversight committee but he chose not to come, citing the 5th Amendment. </p>

However, <a href="https://www.c-span.org/video/?c4622326/combetta-lied-immunity">one member on the committee</a> believes he lied to the FBI, which would void his immunity agreement. So, it looks like the federal government has handed out a bunch of immunity and received nothing from it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Usually: If you cooperate with our investigation and help us catch a bigger criminal by testifying against them, we&#39;ll ignore the crimes you committed under that person.</p>

<p>But with Hillary: Fuck it, you get immunity. What do you know?
Guy with immunity: My boss is innocent. I did the crime all by myself</p>

<p>Basically, it&#39;s a way to to get underlings to testify against their boss. This way you can jail the mob boss instead of just all the smaller fish who are easily replaceable. </p>

<p>But Combetta, the guy who came to reddit for help, received immunity, said he was the one responsible for deleting emails in an &quot;oh shit&quot; moment. Then refused to even come in front of Congress to answer questions. </p>

<p>Edit: Put in the wrong corrupt person in for Combetta. </p>

    <div class="md"><p><a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=511568">This guy claims to have done it</a></p>

<p>Here&#39;s the thing which they mention in that thread. These guys put up a contest for $500 for anyone to recover it. This procedure is much more expensive to do. You use a scanning electron microscope apparently to produce the image and it&#39;s months of work.</p>

<p><em>It&#39;s months of work</em>. Who the hell wants to win $500 for months of work? Who the hell is going to spend months of work to prove a point that people pretty much already believe? Generally the unpopular argument here is that it&#39;s fine to zero out a disk once, not that you can recover the data.</p>

<p>The theory is there, and apparently they have done this. It&#39;s prohibitively expensive.</p>

<p>The question is, how secure does your data need to be? Really you don&#39;t need to worry about this shit if you use full disk encryption anyway. And it&#39;s extremely easy to overwrite with random data with more than one pass and make it practically impossible. It&#39;s not an issue people will worry about if they encrypt their disk ahead of time.</p>

<p>If you&#39;re storing emails of this much importance, yeah, you should probably do more than overwrite once with zeroes. There&#39;s a chance someone might be willing to spend thousands and months on recovering it. But you&#39;re already an idiot if you didn&#39;t just use full disk encryption for shit like that. It&#39;s really a dumb situation to be in - you have data that someone might spends thousands and months to recover and you didn&#39;t bother to just overwrite it two or three times with random data? Or you didn&#39;t realize ahead of time that Hillary&#39;s emails should be on a fully encrypted disk? It&#39;s pretty fucking amateur, but if these guys do it for money, I guess it isn&#39;t that infrequent.</p>

<p>Yet there&#39;s video and audio proof of trump literally admitting to sexual assault. I think you guys call it &quot;locker room talk&quot;?</p>

<p>What planet do you wake up on each morning? Because it isn&#39;t earth. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>there exists, quite literally, one single video of Trump JOKING that he grabs women inappropriately.  And technically, there is no &quot;video evidence&quot;, you weak shill.  </p>

<p>Frankly, I don&#39;t believe any of them, either.  This guy has been in the public eye since the 70&#39;s and apparently these women waited until 1 month before the election to even mention a single word about it?  </p>

<p>That&#39;s sounds legitimate.. /sarcasm</p>

<p>Oh and don&#39;t forget that team Democrat has been proven, several times over, during this election cycle, to lie, cheat, and steal at every opportunity.  There is not a word that comes from them that has any merit.  I&#39;m not even Republican.............</p>

<p>Regardless, I don&#39;t know why you bother coming to r/conspiracy.  Your ctr numbers are thoroughly overwhelmed here.  Just stick to r/politics and all of the other shill subs.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s my reply:</p>

<ul>
<li>Any violation of state statutes against gambling, murder, kidnapping, extortion, arson, robbery, bribery, dealing in obscene matter, or dealing in a controlled substance or listed chemical (as defined in the Controlled Substances Act);</li>
<li>Any act of bribery, counterfeiting, theft, embezzlement, fraud, dealing in obscene matter, obstruction of justice, slavery, racketeering, gambling, money laundering, commission of murder-for-hire, and many other offenses covered under the Federal criminal code (Title 18);</li>
<li>Embezzlement of union funds;(actually NPO funds)</li>
<li>Bankruptcy fraud or securities fraud;</li>
<li>Money laundering and related offenses;</li>
<li>Bringing in, aiding or assisting aliens in illegally entering the country (if the action was for financial gain);</li>
<li>Acts of terrorism.</li>
</ul>

<p>Pretty much all of them, except the drug and copyright infringement.</p>

“Air America meets  Traffic meets Pineapple Express”</p>

<p>A steady diet of movies like the upcoming ‘Mena’ starring Tom Cruise playing the supposedly-swashbuckling former Air America  pilot Barry Seal, has given the movie-going public the idea that the real action in the illegal drug trade is in drug trafficking.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So giving you the benefit of the doubt on the acts -- I think you misunderstand the purpose and scope of RICO.</p>

<p>x1. That&#39;s for state bribery laws. I&#39;m not sure what state bribery laws you&#39;d suggest she broke. I believe they generally apply only to state officials, and she hasn&#39;t been one since she became SoS.</p>

<p>x2.  Money laundering -- I know you don&#39;t like the way the money moves here, but I don&#39;t there there&#39;s anything in the materials here (and yes, I read them) that suggest money laundering. Racketeering? Unless you explain further, I have zero idea what you&#39;re getting at.</p>

<p>x2a. Bribery is a bit strange -- but if what you and the people around here assert is true, I think there could be a RICO charge. My first thought was that the predicate offense was giving bribes, but the law (18 USC 1961) is drafted so that any violation of 18 USC 201 counts, and indeed, RICO has been used to prosecute such crimes. (edit: when I say &quot;if what you assert is true&quot; I mean the assertion that there is prosecutable bribery. I&#39;m not convinced personally and don&#39;t think the info provided adds up to a triable case.)</p>

<p>x3. You don&#39;t get to rewrite the law. It&#39;s embezzlement of union funds, not any funds.</p>

<p>x4. Again, this is for securities fraud, which is a pretty narrow term and almost certainly doesn&#39;t apply to the administration of a §501 non profit.</p>

<p>x5. Are you saying that her purported goal of &quot;open borders&quot; = adding or assisting aliens in illegally entering? The link you provide seems to suggest that any failure to perfectly police all US borders is tantamount to &quot;assisting aliens to illegally enter.&quot; </p>

<p>x6. Well, I&#39;m not gonna go there.</p>

<p>They say it takes a lot more effort to rebut/ refute than to make up accusations -- and I guess they&#39;re right. In your shotgun spray of random guesses at the law, you hit exactly one thing.  The receipt of bribes, as a violation of federal bribery laws is a cognizable RICO predicate act.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>First off, your argument is <a href="https://yourlogicalfallacyis.com/the-fallacy-fallacy">a logical falacy</a>.</p>

<p>Secondly, even if you exclude the the borders issue, it does not invalidate the other issues. You don&#39;t have to hit every point on the RICO dartboard in order to have a case brought against you. If your only arguement is that she didn&#39;t bring aliens over the border, then you&#39;re not doing a very good job.</p>

Why bother posting it, if you know it&#39;s wrong, and it&#39;s not a key part of your argument?</p>

<p>Right, because you&#39;d be ok lying and twisting the facts to suit your own message. And I&#39;m supposed to spread your message? How would I look? Pretty stupid if I think Clinton could be tried for bringing in illegal immigrants based on the quote about green energy and open borders in a future pipe dream.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Never said it was false. Just said that without that particular point, the RICO argument still stands.</p>

<p>I will say this: That argument is not directly drawn from the evidence presented here. It is, in fact, over 20 years old referencing the Clinton activities in Mena, AR. That is probably well past the statute of limitations. You&#39;ll learn more about that after Hillary is indicted, when they do her documentary. Yes, her campaign wants open borders, and that&#39;s their selling point. That&#39;s not why they want open borders.</p>

<p>In the mean time, feel free to actually come up with an argument that invalidates the grounds for a RICO case against Clinton Foundation.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>John Kerry was never swiftboated?  I hope you&#39;re joking and I just can&#39;t see the context.  The term &quot;swiftboating&quot; is named after political attacks that were used against Kerry in his presidential run to demean his opposition to Vietnam despite being a veteran.  The swift boats were mentioned in an ad and were the crux of the attack.  That term wouldn&#39;t exist without Kerry and that election.  So, again, I hope you&#39;re joking in saying &quot;Kerry never got swiftboated&quot;.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>OP:</p>

<p>Learn how to present a case. </p>

<p>This is like when my clients send me an email with like 11 attachments and say &#39;Here&#39;s the supporting evidence.&#39; I say: &#39;Fine. It&#39;ll take me at least an hour to peruse each of these emails, taking notes, cross-referencing one to another, trying to work out <em>which</em> bits of each attachment <em>you</em> think are relevant to the case you are trying to make, and then producing a written summary for my own use and finally responding to you to check that I&#39;ve understood everything.</p>

<p><strong>OR</strong></p>

<p>You could put your argument in writing, referring to the attachments, so that I can understand in a few minutes what would otherwise take me a long time to work out.</p>

<p>One of these is going to cost you £100s, the other about a tenth of that.&#39;</p>

<p>It&#39;s the same here. I have limited time to follow arguments people are making on reddit - I have a job, and a life. </p>

<p>If you say you have &quot;proof&quot; of wrongdoing, make your argument, and link to the supporting evidence as you go along. I&#39;m not trawling through great chunks of text in the hope that I can work out what <em>you</em> think is &#39;evidence&#39; - let alone &#39;proof&#39;.</p>

<p>Oh, wait. Sorry. </p>

<p>Edit: I don&#39;t watch 18 minute long videos produced by people I&#39;ve never heard of allegedly setting out theories about wholesale conspiracies which run counter to my extensive experience of real life. </p>

<p>What I <em>will</em> do is read a paragraph summarising the allegations because that takes me 30 seconds and not a third of an hour.</p>

<p>The reason I take that approach is that in the 20 odd years since I first had access to the internet, too many of these videos that I have been invited to watch have been (quite apart from sometimes being almost unwatchable) complete and utter bollocks from start to finish, sloppy arguments, inadequate evidence, begging the question, logic fails, unjustified assumptions, jumping the gun, every sloppy technique.</p>

<p>&#39;Proof&#39; that Harold Smith got a blow job from Elaine Jones is a video in which they are both clearly identifiable and there&#39;s no evidence of tampering via Adobe Premiere Pro. Demonstrating that they were once at the same party and seen talking together and that Elaine has given blow jobs to other people and that Harold has had blow jobs from other people and that Daryl Hackenback wrote an email to his mother saying that he thought there was something fishy about them being at the same party - there&#39;s nothing there. </p>

<p>I think the Washington Post article is a bit sanitized. The TYT vid actually shows the actual email snippets, but it doesn&#39;t constitute legal evidence.  It shows that the lawyer, Band, being upset at Chelsea asking questions about things, stating that his clients don&#39;t really care about the fund, shows the millions that the firm has made for both the fund and Bill Clinton broken down by year, and he points out that they stand to earn $66M over the next decade, and that Chelsea&#39;s interference jeopardizes should the media find out.</p>

<p>Reasonable people can see the veiled threat, but it obviously it can be argued differently in court because the essential point, what the Clintons have done in return, is missing.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Lol so maybe do your own research like everyone else? If you&#39;ve noticed, there have been several Clinton dumps over the last few weeks. It&#39;s in the examination process, notice how most of these posters are adding info they have found for themselves on top of what is posted. If you want a tl;dr than you have to wait until the evidence is examined more, you can&#39;t expect instant gratification in this it takes time. All these leaks add a few more pieces to a puzzle, it&#39;s impossible to give definitive answers at this point.</p>

No. It&#39;s not impossible, but it&#39;s highly unlikely. This is a conclusion which one would reach <em>prima facie</em> about any senior politician.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Therefore, if I&#39;m browsing Reddit and I read the thread title &quot;this is ACTUAL PROOF…&quot; I am motivated to look and see whether – against likelihood – someone has produced solid evidence, or even proof, that Hillary Clinton is indeed the sort of person that Republican diehards accuse her of being.</p>

<p>I have absolutely no intention of spending hours trawling the World Wide Web in an effort to discover something which I consider to be highly improbable. But I will look at a Reddit post to see what it says.</p>

This is fact. </p>

<p>Then there&#39;s the actual security concern she ignored. That guy Guccifer wasn&#39;t a hacker, he was some guy who read Hillary&#39;s autobiography and guessed her password.

<p>There&#39;s no evidence of that. You are imposing your own conclusion on a fact. As a matter of law/logic you have to demonstrate that that was her motive.</p>

<p>Clearly, there were breaches of security. But the head of the FBI, a known Republican, was unable to find the evidence necessary to prosecute her.</p>

<p>There&#39;s no evidence she lied, either - so far as I am aware. People say, e.g. &#39;She said there were no confidential emails, but there were, she said there were not emails marked confidential, but there were&#39;. In fact, she said there were no emails with &#39;confidential&#39; headers and there weren&#39;t; the FBI accepted that she didn&#39;t realise that a portion header &#39;C&#39; could mean confidential. And only 3 emails out of the bunch had even a &#39;C&#39; portion header.</p>

<p>Yes, she made mistakes. Yes, she was culpable for those mistakes. But to constantly assert - as has been happening for the past six months at least - that she has lied and that she had some ulterior motives is simply to state a belief that is not grounded in the evidence, but represents a personal conviction.</p>

<p>I should say I&#39;m English, living in England, so my assessment is as objective as it gets. (Apart from the fact that the prospect of a Trump presidency is truly terrifying.) </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Okay so even though there are X many emails still unreleased, not a matter of national national security - ok. Just knowingly set up an insecure server. Whatever. How about the fact that she obviously rigged this election against the person that ACTUALLY was beating Trump in the polls. What&#39;s the precedent for the head of the DNC stepping down after being implicated in being unbiased towards candidates, and then immediately made head of the campaign for the person she was accused of favoring?</p>

<p>And just one more time so you can&#39;t dodge the question: </p>

<p>What&#39;s the precedent for the head of the DNC stepping down after being implicated in being unbiased towards candidates, and then immediately made head of the campaign for the person she was accused of favoring?</p>

<p>She&#39;s a snake, and a liar and a cheater. It really doesn&#39;t take a genius to figure out she&#39;s scum. Stop arguing like a lawyer and think like a person. Just because something is in the grey area of legal doesn&#39;t make it right. I just can&#39;t see myself ever supporting a candidate I consider immoral. </p>

<p>See, this is why discussions with some people are pointless. Either you can&#39;t comprehend ordinary English, or you&#39;re too enraged to read carefully.</p>

<p>Let me explain: not only did I not <em>make</em> that assumption, but furthermore, nothing I wrote suggested that I had. For all I know you could be voting for that libertarian candidate, you know, the forgettable one.</p>

<p>Just so we&#39;re clear: it&#39;s that sentence including the word &#39;scum&#39; that brought the discussion to an end, and then you started up with the insult flinging. Notice I didn&#39;t descend to your level.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My dad has quite a lot of friends. There&#39;s a couple of ladies that used to come over for &#39;doll classes&#39; with my (deceased) step-mother - they used to make replica dolls, right through from making the heads out of clay and firing them, through to making their clothes. Then there&#39;s the widow of one of his best friends from the RAF. Then there&#39;s the six or seven people in his Thursday evening art group (more wine and gab than art, but still), and then his neighbours on both sides. Come to think about it, his social life&#39;s better than mine. (Although he grumbles a lot more.)</p>

<p>My mum gets several hours of pleasure each week thinking about what she&#39;d do with her winnings: a £million to me, a £million to my sister, a nice new house with a big garden not more than a couple of miles from where she lives now, a new car for my step-father, a £million to my step-brother, a £million to my auntie... at £2 a throw it&#39;s better value than a cinema ticket!</p>

<p>I forget what we were arguing about. This is more fun. How about your parents?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My mum&#39;s not addicted to the lottery. My stepdad goes down to the shop once a week to buy two tickets. <em>Then</em> she luxuriates in all the pleasurable fantasies. Poker would be too-oo stressful.</p>

<p>Sorry to hear about your dad - and your mom. Also, that you are at risk of falling behind in your rent. That&#39;s rough. </p>

<p>I&#39;m not entirely comfortable, but at this time I&#39;m in no danger of being unable to pay rent. I have had problems in the past. One time while I was studying law my landlord said &#39;If you can&#39;t afford the rent, skip it for a while until your on solid ground&#39;. He was a good bloke. (His father was a very nasty East End gangster.)</p>

<p>Bipolar - wow. I have no end of health issues but fortunately no mental health issues (is that acceptable terminology now?) I had a client who&#39;d been diagnosed with schizophrenia - actually, my clients were his parents. His mother could not bring herself to accept that her son was really unwell - he&#39;d stabbed his father in the neck and talked about aliens making him kill his brother - she thought that all he needed was regular meals and a mother&#39;s love. I suppose I&#39;m trying to say that we all have shit to deal with and although you gotta play the hand you were dealt, other people know and sympathise with what you&#39;re going through and may be going through similar shit as well.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t think it&#39;s right to say that <em>the system</em> is rigged. What it is, is that the rich and powerful have more ability to exploit the system, and the poor and powerless have very little.</p>

<p>It&#39;s important because this provides context. The rich and powerful have always exploited the system (or, nearly always). It&#39;s how England turned from a Saxon country to a Norman country, it&#39;s how the Confederate south funded the war, it&#39;s how Spanish and Portuguese royalty carved out empires in the new world. </p>

<p>But things are getting better. No-one was worrying about elections in the fifteenth century, because governments and administrations were monarchies and dictatorships. It might not have arrived quickly enough for you and your family, but the introduction of democracy is pretty much irreversible (like the appearance of atmospheric oxygen on Earth) and eventually societies will be fair - perhaps not totally fair, but enough so that it doesn&#39;t make a big difference.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Very true, and your point isn&#39;t lost on me. But at the same time, the people who have been in control have stood by as the world was destroyed, who support the people making the most money off of the most immoral things. We as a people can do far more damage in a much shorter time than at any point in history, thus requiring us to be more responsible as a whole because the failures would be more devastating now than they have in the past. Which we are not doing now, this entire election is irresponsible as fuck. Either way rights will be lost. The only thing the candidates agree on is that people on the federal watchlist (a list that requires no due process) should not bear arms (constitutional right). Hillary supports fracking and Trump doesn&#39;t even believe in global warming. This global climate is a travesty.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh dear, you&#39;re not in a good place, are you?</p>

<p>Believe me, if Hillary is elected, the US will be far more responsive to climate change issues than it has ever been. Plus, while I wouldn&#39;t want to encourage people in power to act as if global warming isn&#39;t a threat, the way it will work is this: as the problems get more imminent and more serious, more money and effort will be spent in solving the problems. People like Elon Musk are leading the way, but where I am - for example - they are constructing a huge wind farm out to sea - dozens of giant wind generators in long rows. Eventually, there will be a tipping point and suddenly renewables will be cheaper than oil, and then it will all change. </p>

<p>People are already working on atmospheric scrubbers, which will remove greenhouse gases from the air and do something useful with it; they&#39;ll do the same thing with sea water.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not saying this is enough; already there are serious threats to peoples lives and livelihoods all over the world. But there isn&#39;t going to be a global disaster.</p>

<p>Excuse me? That escalated rather suddenly, didn&#39;t it?</p>

<p>It might take <em>you</em> 18 minutes to come up with my last post, but for me it was significantly faster than watching that video. Like, a tenth of the time.</p>

<p>However, since you descended into nasty insults <em>in no time at all</em>, you&#39;ve removed all incentive I had to find out more on this subject so...</p>

<p>Horse laugh here. Like you actually had any incentive to begin with. </p>

<p>Nasty insult? No.  I made a graphic comparison about your mental outlook. You want all information chewed up, predigested and spewed into your weak mind and then when I point this out in a graphic way to demonstrate your completely worthless viewpoints you claim I&#39;ve insulted you so badly you lost incentive to do your own thinking. As if you ever did. Thanks buddy for making your dismissal so easy. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>i&#39;m sorry are we watching the same video?</p>

<p>we have here cenk ugyur explaining that donations to the clinton foundation were rewarded with a favorable ear from the politicians involved.  this is a pretty regular occurrence, actually, politicians are given money and in return those who give money are rewarded with attention.  this process is called <em>lobbying</em>.  generally, this attention is rewarded for contributions to campaigns rather than charity, which seems like pretty much strictly better.  dont tell me you&#39;re naive enough to think that this sort of scandal isn&#39;t commonplace in DC</p>

<p>this ranks as a 2/10 on the conspiracy scale (2/10 for &quot;Unsurprising or expected result, leak is ignored by mainstream media for lack of public interest, or is buried under other second page news within a few days&quot;, for context, Snowden was more like a 4/10).  It&#39;s not a major conspiracy, nor the root of all evil, let alone a world-government level discovery.  nobody died, nobody was killed and buried in a park, and nobody bribed somebody to stop investigating them in court... this is not even the biggest conspiracy to break this election season, not even the biggest clinton conspiracy this season.  if i were you i would be a little bit less melodramatic and dig deeper to find something a bit more exciting</p>

Honestly, for all the problems with Clinton i can&#39;t really hope she doesn&#39;t win the presidency, as Trump would most likely be worse.</p>

<p>I think we need to really continue to put pressure on the government over the next four years to have an independent leftist movement and so that we can start reforming at midterm season.  Or I suppose I could move to somewhere with condorcet voting or something</p>

<p>The clintons have their tendrils in everything, DOJ, FBI, MSM. That&#39;s who they refer to in the emails as surrogates. I dived into this a little bit here: <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/WikiLeaks/comments/5agpsf/a_thread_that_needs_to_be_researched/">https://np.reddit.com/r/WikiLeaks/comments/5agpsf/a_thread_that_needs_to_be_researched/</a></p>

<p>There&#39;s been talk of a movement to oust these plants by the intel communities, as well as speculation that the leaks themselves are provided by none other than the NSA. Perhaps the nsa are like that batman movie, and all this 5 eyes prism shit was really just to trap hillary and when she&#39;s in jail and the gov&#39;t resets, they&#39;ll enter the destruct command and dismantle the data center in utah.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I mean, in a narrow sense, yeah, but I would imagine that things expand far beyond the level of quid pro quolitics.  As far as the email thing, if there&#39;s anything here, it&#39;s something big.  The question is how much is connected.  Kaine seems like a petulant child, so I doubt he&#39;s involved, and the Brazile thing is frankly just stupid (wait you mean there would be questions on the flint water poisoning in flint michigan?!?!?), but as for the emails are we looking at a huge structure or several small structures.  Comey is a republican and the timing of the Weiner thing seems designed to affect the election, but it seems ineffective to the point that either Comey is relatively unimportant in the underlying structure, or he&#39;s a fool, or he&#39;s a fall guy for a conspiracy designed to look like the Clinton left is under attack.  </p>

<p>Regardless, the efforts by the citizenry have been pretty pathetic up to this point.  Like you don&#39;t even need a masterful conspiracy to deal with a bunch of dudes chilling in central park grilling hot dogs and filling out FOIA requests.  Really if there&#39;s real change you want somebody deep on the inside, not a mook like snowden, but somebody with real power and influence, to go public and do damage, while becoming high enough profile that they don&#39;t just accidentally light their flat on fire</p>

<p>So many connected. Remember, Hillary&#39;s top aid is married to a republican congressman under investigation for sexting a minor AND connected to UAE who fund ISIS.</p>

<p>It&#39;s just a piece of the puzzle. Let&#39;s break that one down.</p>

<ul>
<li>Kaine, after being promised VP, steps down as DNC Chair</li>
<li>Debbie Weisman steps up as DNC Chair, colludes to get HRC nomination</li>
<li>DNC and HRC team collude to rearrange primary dates to favor HRC</li>
<li>Donna Brazile feeds HRC questions from upcomming debates. (The flint question was not the only time she was fed questions)</li>

    <div class="md"><p>I believe in the polling because frankly saying otherwise is bullshit. Obviously some polls are going to be biased, so I use 538&#39;s Poll Aggregate to average the good polls and weed out the bad ones. It was the most accurate estimate in the previous two elections. </p>

<p><a href="http://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2016-election-forecast/#plus">Here is their most accurate estimate</a>. </p>

<p>Keep in mind that the majority of the current Trump upswing is largely from Gary Johnson loosing 50% of his support over the past week. </p>

<p><a href="http://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2016-election-forecast/new-jersey/#plus">Since you mentioned New Jersey specifically</a>. </p>

<p>I personally would not consider the election rigged if it ends up anywhere close to this.  <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/30/ElectoralCollege1972.svg/684px-ElectoralCollege1972.svg.png">This is what Nixon&#39;s rigging looked like, and  he didn&#39;t actually mess with the voting process</a>. To claim the system rigged on a very normal-looking map is garbage pandering, which may incite violence from some communities (especially if Trump refuses to accept the results). </p>

<p>the highest margins I can find in Trump&#39;s favor are about +5 (+1 among polls carrying any weight), and way more of the polls have shown him down by more than that.</p>

<p>It&#39;s tightening but she&#39;s still got an average 2-4 points on im and she&#39;s winning early voting polls too</p>

<p>However, I will vote for him because the alternative is horrendous. What is the choice, a jerk who says shit that is offensive and cringey as hell or a corrupt, pathological liar who may or may not get her enemies dead.

What he describes as &quot;locker room talk&quot; is not really something people should be saying in the first place. Furthermore, several cases have arisen regarding past interactions of exactly what he described, that he will go to court for on November 28th.

    <div class="md"><p>Well, he&#39;s done worse things with his foundation, has managed to insult every minority that has more than 1% of the voting block, refuses to release his tax returns, is currently under investigation for a number of alleged sexual assaults, plans on draining the federal budget $1 trillion, and has backpedaled on almost all of his major talking points. </p>

<p>Meanwhile his supporters continue to use violence and intimidation tactics, including burning churches and booby trapping campaign signs at election offices. He has also made statements to the effect that these people should not accept a Hillary victory if it happens, encourages them to physically attack protestors that show up, and say that they should try &quot;exercising their second amendment rights&quot; (AKA shooting people). He has been claiming that the election is rigged for moths before the election even started so that if he looses he already has a narrative spread out for people to latch onto. </p>

<p>It&#39;s not that hard to see why people would think he&#39;s worse off. Hell, I&#39;ve talked to people who think his entire campaign was based off of controlling people through pandering, violence and fear. </p>

<p>Also what&#39;s nuts about what I said?  The first part was just talking about the Spanish-American and Phillippine-American Wars and that was following up on a century of state-sanctioned slavery (350 years total) and a century and a half of state-instituted genocide.  And Trump&#39;s suggested we kill the families of terrorists for... revenge(?) and that we stop giving civilians warnings (because that worked out so well in the early drone strikes right?)- between that and his hatred for nation-building how is that gonna un-destroy the Middle East?</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>President Clinton was asked at his Oct. 7 press conference about Mena, a small town and airport in the wilds of Western Arkansas. Sarah McClendon, a longtime Washington curmudgeon renowned for her off-the-wall questions, wove a query around the charge that a base in Mena was &quot;set up by Oliver North and the CIA&quot; in the 1980s and used to &quot;bring in planeload after planeload of cocaine&quot; for sale in the U.S., with the profits then used to buy weapons for the Contras. Was he told as Arkansas governor? she asked.</p>

<p>&quot;No,&quot; the president replied, &quot;they didn&#39;t tell me anything about it.&quot; The alleged events &quot;were primarily a matter for federal jurisdiction. The state really had next to nothing to do with it. The local prosecutor did conduct an investigation based on what was in the jurisdiction of state law. The rest of it was under the jurisdiction of the United States Attorneys who were appointed successively by previous administrations. We had nothing - zero - to do with it.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>okay, so not only was he not in a position to tell the CIA what to do (because it was the 80s), he didn&#39;t even know about it?  what was this WSJ editorial supposed to prove?</p>

Did you bother to read that article? Of course not. If you had you would have realized:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The F.B.I.’s inquiries into Russia’s possible role continue</p>

<p>Agents scrutinized advisers close to Donald J. Trump, looked for financial connections with Russian financial figures, searched for those involved in hacking the computers of Democrats, and even chased a lead — which they ultimately came to doubt — about a possible secret channel of email communication from the Trump Organization to a Russian bank.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You found the first article that vindicated your traitor candidate. That&#39;s called confirmation bias. Which is exactly what the emails thing is all about. </p>

<p><a href="http://m.motherjones.com/politics/2016/10/veteran-spy-gave-fbi-info-alleging-russian-operation-cultivate-donald-trump">Another article. Dated the same day as your FBI announcement.</a></p>

<p>This is a great example of citing sources and evidence. You&#39;re either incredibly biased or incredibly stupid. Either way, you&#39;re not interested in facts. You&#39;re not even able to provide then to back up you &quot;ACTUAL PROOF&quot; claims. </p>

<p>Confirmation bias - the tendency to interpret new evidence as confirmation of one&#39;s existing beliefs or theories.</p>

<p>The first article you found confirmed your beliefs that Trump isn&#39;t communicating with Russia. But you didn&#39;t even bother to read the article it was referencing.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Article is as credible as the &quot;Hillary suggested droning assange&quot; article, and all sources predate the FBI report.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.nbc26.com/newsy/a-veteran-spy-claims-russia-has-been-aiding-trump-for-years">Maybe NBC is more credible to you. But then you&#39;ll just dismiss it as msm being against your candidate</a></p>

<p>Notice your inability to attack the validity of the claims while shifting the conversation away from original claim that you&#39;re unable to backup. </p>

<p>Also, caps do not make your statements any more believable.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you&#39;re referring to us being CTR hacks (which there are many), based on your ability to write, my reddit account is older than you, which would more than likely preclude me from that. </p>

<p>The alternative is, you are older than six but some how learning how to coherently construct an idea has evaded your mental grasp. Possibly leading us to our current interaction and what I might presume is your support of Trump. </p>

<p>You want to know the difference between the left and the right at this moment? The left hates their candidate. They know she&#39;s a political sack of corrupt shit, but still think she&#39;s the better alternative, and it sickens them. The right praises Trump as god emperor worthy of all, redeemer of America, alpha male extraordinaire, faultless supreme leader.</p>

<p>You don&#39;t see the pile of steaming shit right in fucking front of you! I swear to high hell trumpettes do not deserve to be on this sub. You all lack the ability to think for yourselves in any meaningful way. Look at that sub...</p>

<p>He is a failure as a business person, he has admitted-boasted about sexually assaulting women, he does not pay his debts to contractors and Americans, he has raped women and most likely children, he is a free loading moocher that doesn&#39;t pay taxes, racist, ignorant, liar by which the country has never seen, embroiled in more lawsuits than possibly any other individual, and uglier than the predator without a face mask. We have evidence for all of this. It&#39;s in front of you! You don&#39;t even see the Trump-Russia connection which is point to point. </p>

<p>You&#39;re all tripping over some emails and struggling to prove intent and playing six degrees of Kevin Bacon. </p>

<p>A real conspiracy theorist, not a Trumppette, would see the ENTIRE INCLUDING TRUMP SYSTEM is corrupt. They would know Russia has bought and paid for Trump. They&#39;d know Clinton is the political tool the U.S. powers have chosen for both parties and the election was already determined and we have no choice in the matter. They might even know the Trumps and Clintons are actually close friends, and Trump just happened to get himself into some trouble because he can&#39;t manage businesses or money for shit and he&#39;s trying to get out of it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You could also be brainwashed into seeing an illusion.</p>

<p>When two people see contradictory things, it is usually the person who is seeing additions to reality that is imagining them.</p>

<p>Understand: Trump supporters don&#39;t see him as anything other than a fantastic salesman. Emphasis on man: not a god, not a figurehead, just a man. You hang out with a man, talk shit with him and about him.</p>

<p>So you see Hilary as deeply flawed and corrupt, and now I convince you that the bad things you are hallucinating about Trump (thanks marketing departments!) are just that: hallucinations. I&#39;m not going to go over them point by point, you can do that yourself one you&#39;re aware you could be hallucinating. So now who do you pick?</p>

<p>Don&#39;t wear yourself out trying to chase your thoughts around. Meditate, quiet and calm your mind, and the answer will come to you.</p>

<p>but... that... .... you&#39;re serious, huh. Burden of proof doesn&#39;t shift because you asked a question. The accused doesn&#39;t suddenly get the burden of proof because you decided they have to. ... especially when their evidence was already provided.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>That would be like if CNN said that Donald Trump was a Muslim, you disagreed, and then I said you needed to prove that he wasn&#39;t a Muslim and that CNN was doing great.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>huh? I don&#39;t see how that&#39;s relevant. in your example CNN just made some oddball claim with no evidence...  OP made claims and has links to his evidence, hosted courtesy of wikileaks. His burden of proof is done and over with, it was provided. CNN&#39;s was not in your example and you&#39;re the idiot taking it at face value.</p>

<p>OP presented his evidence and all I see in this specific thread is people saying &quot;But no, it&#39;s not&quot; with absolutely no thought behind it. No evidence to the contrary. Just, &quot;Shut up you&#39;re wrong&quot;.</p>

<p>Is that really how debunking should be? </p>

<p>Shit. Here, I&#39;ll just copy paste what&#39;s in the OP. Here&#39;s his evidence:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://assets.documentcloud.org/documents/3183007/Memo-from-Bill-Clinton-aide-on-how-Teneo.pdf">https://assets.documentcloud.org/documents/3183007/Memo-from-Bill-Clinton-aide-on-how-Teneo.pdf</a> - The Memo</p>

<p><a href="https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/9665">https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/9665</a> - The cover up</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You said,</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It&#39;s acceptable journalism to throw out and discredit all of your work unless you can attach names and verify the information.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In these emails hosted on wikileaks both to and from are listed. you can download the emails yourself and verify that they&#39;re legitimate using [tools that i&#39;m too lazy to google go here].</p>

<p>I have not read it. I do not agree or disagree. I just think it&#39;s fucking stupid to argue with no argument.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s a good example of someone debunking this thread:</p>

<p><a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/5arc3v/this_is_actual_proof_of_clintons_selling_favors/d9jamia/?context=3">https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/5arc3v/this_is_actual_proof_of_clintons_selling_favors/d9jamia/?context=3</a></p>

<p><em>That</em> is what a well laid argument looks like. <em>that</em> is what debunking <em>should</em> look like. Research, thought and maybe even citations. Links to trustworthy sources at bare minimum.</p>

<p>E: I am in actual awe that someone thought your argument was worthy of an upvote.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s more:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If OP wanted to state something that was widely accepted as true and then I told him it wasn&#39;t, then it would be a different situation.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No. OP presented his evidence and beliefs on what that proof alluded to. it doesn&#39;t necessarily <em>have</em> to be 100% verifiably true, this is <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> not <a href="/r/news">/r/news</a>. </p>

<p>In conspiracy theory forums it works like this: OP posts evidence and beliefs, users debunk to the best of their ability. You do your own research based on their evidence and debunk from there. You can&#39;t just outright ignore that it&#39;s there - as you seem to be doing throughout this conversation - and you <em>should not</em> take it at face value. That&#39;s why you do research. To get informed and prove or disprove something for yourself. Debunking is the process of sharing that information with other interested people so they don&#39;t have the same misguided beliefs as OP.</p>

<p>I&#39;m sorry but you&#39;ll have to prove that for me. Another person did in this thread but you&#39;re making the claim so, you know. Go ahead. Again though, I don&#39;t have any intention of defending the claims. but why should I take anything you say at face value if you can&#39;t even read my response to you? how can i know that you actually read the wikileaks emails or have absolutely any idea what you&#39;re talking about? </p>

<p>That is why debunking should take serious thought and research. Through research you learn and through learning you will gain the ability to actually know what you&#39;re talking about. This comes with the ability to properly source your findings like any intelligent human being would if they intended on being taken seriously.</p>

<p>The Washington Post actually went out and did the research to see if these claims hold true.</p>

<p>Unlike the sources you have provided, they actually went out and gathered information, talked to relevant individuals, established oversight to the information collected, and published it in a sensical manner.</p>

<p>The podesta emails are rife with falsehood:</p>

<p>Not to mention that wiki leaks has lost a lot of credibility and a lot of what is &quot;leaked&quot; is arguably injected by agendas.</p>

<p>Edit: I got gilded. Thanks! Goes to show... Stop swallowing these conspiracies. Do your research people and downvote me, I give 0 fucks. And for those that accuse me of &quot;CTR&quot; I had to google what that was. Sleuth my profile, I live in Canada. As far away as you can get from this filthy election. So no, I would actually rather gouge my eyes out then become a CTR. Don&#39;t stand too close to the microwaves, your tin foil hats might get ruined.</p>

<p>i, and thousands of others, clearly heard police officers say dude&#39;s name 5+ times. they confirmed it and spelled it multiple times. boston pd were the ones who first dropped his name on non-secure channel</p>

<p>the fact that a handful of users went on to leave voicemails on that (already deceased) person&#39;s parent&#39;s telephone is very unfortunate, but CANNOT be used to discredit reddit and/or crowdsourced investigations.</p>
