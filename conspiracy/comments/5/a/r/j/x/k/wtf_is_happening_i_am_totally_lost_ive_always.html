    <div class="md"><p>What is being referred to is <a href="http://remnantradio.org/Archives/articles/William%20Cooper/Mystery%20Babylon/MB1.htm">this.</a></p>

<p>There also appears to be <a href="http://www.thewatcherfiles.com/bloodlines/">13 Families (bloodlines)</a> who really control the globe in secret and who practice the above satanic religion.</p>

<p>This all seemed nuts to me before a few months ago. Then the South Korea stuff unfolded to pretty much confirm the Li bloodline and the satanic stuff they practice.</p>

<p>A 4chan <del>FBI</del> financial industry anon went into this a little bit about the ancient knowledge/secrets that they hold, which is why they have such power. He/She said that the history of our species is the greatest lie ever told. Apparently we are on our third iteration, which helps to explain the mysteries of the Egyptian pyramids, etc. </p>

<p>Take it for what it&#39;s worth, but check it out and make your own decisions about it.</p>

<p>Edit: I&#39;m looking for the 4chan link about our species history - I only started lurking there recently. It may have been another insider and not the FBI anon, just to be clear. Will report back when I find it. <strong>Okay, found one of the threads <a href="http://boards.4chan.org/pol/thread/95441792">here.</a></strong> This is someone who works for a thinktank in the financial industry that specializes in US daytrading markets - privy to good intel from reliable sources. He/She says the 8 goddesses (who are controlling the South Korean president) are working for 1 of the Eastern Families. (I assume Li). He/She also discusses our species being the 3rd cycle of mankind in this thread.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=te51Qjlt63U">Here is a quick report on the South Korea president being taken &quot;body and soul&quot;.</a> The cult they are really talking about without knowing it, is the above satanic cult. We understand this &quot;possession&quot; to be modern day MK Ultra, however &quot;soul possession&quot; or mind control has its roots in the <a href="http://www.dougriggs.org/Origins_and_Techniques_of_Monarch_Mind_Control.pdf">Egyptian Book of the Dead.</a></p>

Yesterday at 11 the FBI started leaking docs on the Clintons and <a href="https://youtu.be/ov5kvWSz5LM">this video</a> was released. </p>

<p>This man has not publically shown his face in 20 years and is a former Assistant Secretary of State for 4 administrations. This is just mind blowing shit. There are too many coincidences.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Both parties bought and paid for, clinton&#39;s crimes can no longer be contained and mainstream is beginning to dump her.  We know from wikileaks that clinton campaign pushed trump and told the media to start telling the public to treat trump like a serious contender because he would be the &quot;easiest to beat&quot;.  Alex Jones today schilling hard for trump by hittiing this Clinton issue first.  Even if it is the truth, its going to be a smooth transfer of power to the same money.
