I&#39;ll admit, I am glad the Bush/Clinton dynasty ended, but what we have now is a new era of a Trump dynasty with Trump and his kids and billionaire friends all involved in some coup that nobody actually thought would happen.</p>

<p>But it happened, and we have to do everything we can as conspiracy theorists to expose all the shit Trump and his cronies will try to get away with. He has a record of lying and manipulation, so I can 100% guarantee that he will lie to and manipulate us as a country, as he already has for the past few years since he&#39;s been planning to run for the most powerful seat in the world.</p>

<p>I love America, and I want it to prosper and be successful like all of you here. I also love transparency, and we can&#39;t have people on this sub not fully aware of the hypocrisy and lies of Trump. Please see him with open eyes. Please look at Trump with a r/conspiracy lens. It&#39;s time to make r/conspiracy great again!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The people who actually have irrational faith in Trump are not on this sub. I still have yet to see one person here who actually worships the guy like all these posts are accusing.</p>

<p>It&#39;s this simple: Trump&#39;s winning the election was, in the opinion of people who voted for him here, preferable to Hillary&#39;s winning. That&#39;s it. I voted for Trump and I have no problem reading criticism of him and criticizing him myself. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Maybe if the anti-Trump posts are getting pretty heavily downvoted, there seems to be something strange here. There are a lot of t_d subscribers in this sub, and while I don&#39;t mind that most Donald supporters are also opening the eyes of the American people to wikileaks and what not, I do mind that a lot of them that are here as well have complete blind faith in him as if he was truly a man of the people. Follow his actions, and who he surrounds himself with, who he has been appointing, and you&#39;ll soon realize he is not only not draining the swamp, but rather making the swamp more swampy than ever. </p>

<p>the election votes were obviously rigged yet Trump still managed to overcome. despite.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Division politics is a major tactic of the DNC.</p>

<p>What I don&#39;t understand about &quot;minorities&quot; is how they are surprised by the result of the election or somehow feel they are worthy of more. That&#39;s not how a democracy works. A democracy is supposed to pander to THE MAJORITY, not the MINORITY. Looking around this concept does nothing but create broken societies. You see people complaining about the &quot;silent majority.&quot; You mean the people who respectfully cast their vote in favor of Trump without causing a scene?</p>

<p>A democracy is based on the interests of the many. If you take into account how many Americans actually voted, less than 25% of people wanted EITHER presidential candidate.</p>

<p>The truth of the matter is, Hillary Clinton, through actions of only her own, has made herself a non-viable option for President of the United States of America. Trump got a bye.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree, by definition America is a constitutional republic (the same as Iran a country they refer to as terrorist).</p>

<p>However, more recently America has decided to export its &quot;democracy&quot; all over the world (an unwanted, non-functioning form of government) and it&#39;s left a large portion of the planet in complete turmoil (just like America itself).</p>

<p>I&#39;m simply stating if you want to cry about democracy while also being in the minority, well then I guess you are seeing the faults of that form of government. If America doesn&#39;t function as a democracy, stop calling it one.</p>

<p>Also, I was thinking, what if Hillary really was a good pick, and she would have told us of aliens, but the ultra elite said no way jose and put out all this bad stuff. We see her getting sick and stuff and think &quot;she&#39;s wacky&quot; but we see kanye get taken to the hospital and &quot;he&#39;s taken by the illuminati.&quot; What if they both were? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This actually seems increasingly likely to me, and I wrote about it a week ago or so. Podesta was a huge UFO disclosure advocate, and it looked like disclosure might be near if Hillary got the Presidency. </p>

<p>Then, conveniently for the Majestic cabal, Podesta was thrown under the bus, being implicated in a pedophilia scandal. And that&#39;s how they told everyone that UFO disclosure is a big no-no. Who&#39;s gonna dare step forward with the truth now? </p>

<p>No one. That&#39;s who. Because the cabal has dirt on everyone with UFO knowledge. And if they don&#39;t have dirt, they&#39;ll fabricate it -- or silence you by any means necessary, including &quot;suicide&quot;. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, Hillary has always been a sociopathic politician. She&#39;s developed Parkinson&#39;s disease. A specialized doctor has several videos on YouTube analyzing her symptoms, and she&#39;s hit her head a few times too. </p>

<p>Kanye exhibits signs of bipolar disorder. His history with Jay-Z suggests that he wanted to get into the illuminati to further his fame and wealth. Beyonce fucked him over for a music award, and he&#39;s not happy about it. He knows the larger agenda and his mental illness gives him motivation to speak out to the people. He&#39;s not sociopathic like other celebrities and politicians who value money and power over everything. He is likely bipolar and when he gets manic, he thinks he can save everyone by spewing &quot;radio fuck you&quot; and &quot;Facebook and Google lied to you&quot;. </p>

<p>Kanye&#39;s mom also died, rumored to be an illuminati sacrifice, and Kanye probably is either naturally grieving or feels bad about killing his mom. And after trump got elected, I think he thought &quot;fuck it&quot; but the illuminati knew they had to nip it in the bud before it got out of hand. I&#39;m sure they tried talking to him, and I&#39;m sure he told them to fuck off. Wonder what we&#39;ll see from him next. </p>

<p>that was only because of the backlash when he started stacking his transition team with lobbyists.  then he realized he could make a spectacle about reversing course, but still rely on lobbyists without putting them in official positions.</p>

Just because there are work arounds to his plan it isn&#39;t worth doing? He isn&#39;t even president yet, he hasn&#39;t done anything other than appoint people. I will take conman language over definate WW3 and hatespeach laws any day. Obviously what he SAYS he will do is &quot;just words&quot; why would you even feel the need to point that out? Why not wait and see what he does when he is in office and then criticise his actions, you know, AFTER he actually carries out those actions? I would like to know the answer to your first question primarily as you are beggining to sound salty, seriously if Trump enters office and doesn&#39;t do a thing he promised I will not support him, all I have to go on at the moment is what he says, infact thats all ANYONE has to go on until he actually does something. He was never going to take on the elite, he wouldn&#39;t be where he is if he truely planned to take down the top families, even saying the words &quot;audit the fed&quot; gets you hidden from news coverage i.e Ron Paul. </p>

Tbh as long as Trump doesn&#39;t declare an NFZ over Syria and try to take out their air defense network thus declaring war on Russia (they have a mutual defense agreement) then he is definately better for the American worker than Hillary, who would have us embroiled in another depopulation war within a year</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t doubt it, they absolutely want to depopulate the west and they will find a way, Trump getting in just delayed it for maybe a year or two. Make no mistake though, Hillary would have set up an NFZ to protect the murderous jihadists in Syria, which would entail coalition aircraft going head to head with russias S400, Syrian S300 and their iranian upgraded S200 layered SAM network. That would mean many lost aircraft, and probably more agression against Russia for defending itself Syrian Gov with whom they have a mutual defense agreement. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is a pointless hypothetical at this point, but this is an extremely unlikely scenario. Any NFZ would have been worked out with the Russians. America knew its little &#39;moderate&#39; jihadist gambit had crashed and burned, they never expected the Russians to step up and for it to actually work. Everyone in Syria is murderous. There was always a risk of accidental escalation but that wasn&#39;t the plan. She didn&#39;t want to own Syria, just box in Russia and get the pipeline. They were playing 34D chess with the Russians, but they just switched their opponent to a toddler. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Are you not familiar with the Project for a new American Century or the Greater Israel project? They have wanted a puppet in Syria for decades. They already tried to invade Syria to oust Assad, they failed to get any support. Syria and Russias mutual defense agreement means if you declare war on one, you declare war on both. Make no mistake, an NFZ means war, either immediately after they stop anything other than coalition aircraft flying or not long after. Russia has few allies remaining, they know they cannot be seen to be unreliable in this area or they will lose their other allies and have no chance of forming allegiances in the future. Even if the plan isn&#39;t a third world war with Russia, if there is even a chance it could happen then from my perspective there is nothing that is worth that risk, especially not to overthrow a dicator who is keeping the lid on the crockpot of jihadists but has the support of the majority of his people as for the most part, whilst he is corrupt, he lets them get on with their lives and practice whatever religious and cultural stuff they want in exchange for islamists who will kill you if you don&#39;t conform to their particular brand of Islam. </p>

<p>Overall on Syria I agree it was a mistake to try to take out Assad. Hillary was normal hawk. But now we&#39;ve got a genetically modified hawk the size of a Daenerys&#39;s dragons as SecDef.  </p>

I just mentioned the NFZ as it was one of the things Hillary was using to show her &quot;strength&quot; and is possibly the worst realistic step that could be taken in the Syrian theatre, and something Trump is not likely to go for. What do you think Trump will do that makes him worse than Hillary btw? Not attacking you, I would like a fresh perspective on this :)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hillary would have been a continuation of current US policy. Trump will vastly overestimate US global military power to enforce US policy. He will attempt to run the US government like he ran his business. You see his reports of gross valuation as an impressive feat, and the way we worship wealth in this country, this makes him look as if he has some special skill or insight that will be used for America&#39;s benefit. What the people you hate have been telling you about him is actually true. He is a con man narcissist who is not interested in learning who is only in this for himself. This means that in practice he will ignore nonpartisan subject matter policy experts. His decisions will be made based on his own feelings rather than facts on the ground. It is difficult to know how exactly this will play out, I for one did not expect him to be played so easily by Taiwan. Allies have their own interests which do not align with our own. Without a realist at the helm, the ship of state is in for rough seas ahead. </p>

<p>The election game he won is nothing compared to the real world of 34D interdimensional chess that is international relations. </p>

<p>The main thing is long term decline of American power. Managing the rise of China is a complex operation. This is not a rival corporation that can be crushed. The rules of NY real estate and media manipulation do not apply. Just because you are great at picking up women, does not mean that you will win the respect and admiration of other men. China is their own man, not reliant on us as much as we think they are. Soft power is the name of the game, we are returning to a multipolar world. Asia is the future, and America wins by making the rules of the global game. You can&#39;t opt out of globalism, that is just declining to take a turn. </p>

<p>The problem is that of course globalism so far has only served the elite, they took out democracy and stopped any development of a true effective populist leader. Instead we have a bad impersonation of one. </p>

<p>So expect to see the deficit skyrocket within 8 years as he gives away as many public assets to the private sector as he can, making sure elites don&#39;t pay taxes, moving the burden of the military industrial complex to the already squeezed middle classes. Even though they now have total power they will blame Democrats for their actions. </p>

<p>The type of protectionist measures and confrontation will increase consumer prices chasing old industries. Our allies will move away from our sphere of influence because American dominance is based on the soft power of stability. An unpredictable Trump will lead friends and foes alike to cut us out across the world. He is used to negotiating from power, and the US actually has much less power than his voting block thinks it does. The stick is a weak tool compared to the carrot. We aren&#39;t going to war to save Taiwan. The real alphas who run other nations will have a great time gaming the pick up artist in chief. This means Pakistan will pursue its interests in Kashmir, Russia will take back as much of the USSR as it can, China will expand its influence in South East Asia, North Korea will troll harder, Islamic Jihadists will win over much more of the 1.6 billion Muslims that will attempt to engineer the clash of civilizations by getting America to repeat the mistakes of Iraq in Iran. The petrodollar that makes the goods and services cheap in America for no good reason will be broken when Europe, Russia, Saudi Arabia and China all decide to create a reserve currency not based on the dollar to buy oil, meaning that the US loses the control over our currency and interest rates skyrocket. Capital is the true owner of this world, and capital flight to more stable nations will leave the middle class absolutely demolished. </p>

<p>Long term this is a disaster, hopefully in the short term he fails quickly enough that the reigns of power are taken back by more responsible GOPers. </p>

<p>The attacks were damaging, and therefore must have been genuine.

    <div class="md"><p>Gun control is a cultural issue on both sides, like abortion. Each side uses it to play their base. For Hillary, her anti-gun stance was the only way she could outflank Bernie with the liberal base to the left, so she took it. An outright ban was and is off the table because the entire gun debate is a trap. Holding onto your sword or giving up the sword is irrelevant, sword power is over. They are passing you by, and the elite leave both sides distracted from the real battlefield. I also did not say about giving anything up, but I&#39;m watching the Orwellian technology tank flank our columns. It doesn&#39;t really matter if I hold my musket in retreat or not. Fighting over whether we retreat with or without them makes no difference, either way we are ignoring the tank. </p>

<p>Conflict with China over Taiwan. Mad Dog is going to start something with Iran. The croniest capitalist will give away as much of the public coffer to the billionaires as they can. This is picking your pocket. Tax cuts and eviscerating Social security will cost you money. We are all now Flint, unless you own a polluting industry, the air you breathe, the food you eat, and the water you drink will be more polluted under Trump than Hillary. You will not see personal financial gains more than the owners of capital. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks for the sanity. This is the sad truth and the best comment in this thread. </p>

<p>Having worked in the system I know very well that Trump will not change much, there is far too much power and influence to even allow that even if he wanted to. Does he want to? Unlikely, Trump has wanted more than anything to be accepted by the elites his whole life, they always kept him on the outside and looked down on him and why he has that chip on his shoulder. </p>

<p>There does seem to be a very concerted effort to paint Trump voters as various things, the recent trend is that they think he is the 2nd coming and he&#39;s going to screw his voters. Yeah, no shit and if you are not cynical about our political system you&#39;re either very young or very stupid. Obama, whom I voted for, completely screwed over his voters whom were far more starry eyed about him than I see the average Trump voter being about Trump. </p>

<p>I voted Trump this time as despite what Trump is, the alternative was far far worse. </p>

<p>I feel his reputation would be far worse if he was seeking to get his fill of negative energy like the elites do.  </p>

<p>If he&#39;s already been doing it then the point is moot, but the reaction to him is a bit too complicated to be a complete fabrication, at least in my very limited perception. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>If there&#39;s anything I know about watching Trump the last 18 months, is he is unpredictable.</p>

<p>People who spent the last year increduluos that Trump is even part of the national conversation seem surprisingly clairvoyant on how it&#39;s going to turn out. I don&#39;t buy it.</p>

<p>Those whom are MAGA hat wearing supporters will have too many anti-Obama winners arent losers stars in their eyes to critically process liberal or even moderate criticism. In the ends of the bell curve it gets bad.</p>

<p>Honestly Trump needs to somehow in hell win 2020 to prove he&#39;s not a joke. (And to win). Take everything he does from here on in this lense, and let&#39;s see where it takes us.</p>

<p>Remember, all he has to do to win is beat whatever the democrats can muster in 4 years after a Clinton implosion.</p>

<p>America aside, all he has to do is maintain incumbent inertia (optically deliver on camping promises &quot;unlike politicans and more like business&quot;). Carrier deal is an example.</p>

<p>Next, he has to use his faith in selling a story to sell you the next one. That&#39;s where the democrat in 2020 comes in.</p>

<p>Who will it be? THAT is what Trump will care the most about on his twitter come 2018. </p>

<p>The game is a prop for the show. He will sell the Trump brand to the world. Will you buy it?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The big difference between Hillary and Trump here is that Hillary has a political history of behaving negatively and catering to her financiers.  Trump doesn&#39;t have a political history, just a private sector one- so everything is based on speculation on what he will do and how he will do it, because i dont think the private sector is a great indicator about how he will behave.

    <div class="md"><p>I hate Hillary and dislike Trump.  In my opinion Trumps ideology of &quot;over extend your finances, do everything on credit then declare bankruptcy&quot; is the type of thinking that have bilked billions of dollars from US citizens and left small companies who extended credit to Trump and others like him devastated.  Large (too big to fail) companies got subsidized and smaller Mom and Pop type companies got the shaft.  If you or I did the financial acrobatics of Trump we would be unable to purchase anything on credit or work without having our pay/taxs being garnished (at a minimum ) or in jail.  His &quot;I do it because the law allows it&quot; and &quot;if you don&#39;t like it change the law&quot; attitude sickens me due to the fact that those loopholes in the law are put there by the filthy rich, for the filthy rich and each and every tax payer foots the bill!  </p>

<p>Having said all that...I voted for Trump because I figured he was so good and bilking the system that he just might declare bankruptcy on the Federal Reserve and close it down and I would love to see that happen!  I have no &quot;Trump-Train&quot; delusions that he will magically &quot;fix&quot; our problems, I think he (like Obama has been put into office as a means to an end)  what exactly that end is I am unsure?  I can say though that his &quot;un-wussification&quot; of America in the eyes of the world is highly frightening and I agree 1000% that a watchful and knowledgeable eye must be kept upon Trump and the dynasty/war machine that he is building.  Make no mistake people this is not a &quot;nice guy&quot; he is savvy and he is morally corrupt as are most all of our politicians and as such we must stay vigilant as always! 
Edit as an after thought~~~If Trump wants to make brownie points with me he would appoint Gen. Wesley Clark!</p>

<p>I am sorry, you are the wuss. There is no nice way of saying that. But I think you are also smart enough to see what has happened, and what will happen. It was easy to hate the previous status quo, they certainly deserved it. But when we vote, we are picking different factions within the establishment. The faction that just won played you for a fool. This truth is not easy for the ego to accept, and it is easier to attack me. Just think about it as you watch what happens during the next 4 years. I hope 4 years from now you&#39;ll be a force to be reckoned with if you apply yourself. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>HAHA one man&#39;s billionaire is another man&#39;s friend, same government a few different seats. </p>

<p>I think when people misunderstand something, they just hate, it this nature that is made so much easier by this media, proving this species will not change. Now try using your mind and work out the concept offered.</p>

<p>There will always be a government and that won&#39;t change, so fiscally those seats have played musical numbers. I agree there might be some aesthetics, maybe a few reforms implemented because hey the seats have changed, possibly leading to a few new laws etc. Ultimately will that history read any differently?</p>

<p>Trump much better represents the interest of the people here than the other politicians, the same phenomena people are questioning when it comes to him winning the election.</p>

<p><a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> isn&#39;t your personal witch hunt against Trump, there are many many more crooked people (Hillary Clinton, Bill Clinton, Chelsea Clinton, John Podesta, Tony Podesta, etc.) to focus on a person who has a fraction of the dirt on them, when these scumbag people are still walking around freely. </p>

You must remove yourself and your mind from the bubble that has been built around you since birth. That&#39;s the only path to enlightenment. It took years for me, and I&#39;ve seen it take decades for some. After Jan 20th you are going to see a lot of people step out of ONE of those boxes, but there are still more than partisan politics at work here in an effort to control and manipulate.</p>

<p>These racist dumbasses thought he was going to investigate 9/11 and prosecute Clinton.</p>

<p>Too bad they forgot he was a democrat in 2010 and supported Clinton in 07 donated to her foundation in 08 and even endorsed her in 2012.
He was pro choice and for universal healthcare.</p>

<p>Trump trolled America.
Democrats hated him(with a passion), and he split the Republican Party up very easily.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>For example Alex Jones.     For example the fans of Breitbart.    You  are correct.    These people really want to give  Trump the &quot;benefit of the doubt&quot;  to the point they have lost all objectivity.    We Are Change,  What Really Happened, and tons of other websites and youtube channels got heavily into the kool aide and on board with the Trump fan club.    Sad to watch.    Also a lot of the economic guru figures like Greg Hunter.</p>

<p>I fully agree that the election of Trump was a turning point,  timewise,  that the frustration with the absolute bankruptcy of the liberals/left/Democrats and corporate media have been thankfully exposed.</p>

<p>However,  the work has only begun,  and neither right nor left,  red or blue are the identifiers for truth.    So much media,  corporate and alternative have been discredited,  were wrong before the election,  and are still wrong.    There is no one channel or politician who is right on everything.    You have to look at it issue by issue.   Syria,   the Federal Reserve,  Election Reform,  The War on Drugs,  etc.  etc.</p>

<p>I think people forget that Trump is still a Human Being and as rich as that guy is he still suffers from the same limitations all humans have. You think he got to be a billionaire by being Stupid? he is one of the most intelligent people in the world. You have to believe that somebody as intelligent as that has to reach a point in his life where he realizes that if the world continues down this path its going to end up to be a Nuclear fallout wasteland and all the money in the world isn&#39;t going to help him breathe fresh air and enjoy the blue sky&#39;s.</p>

<p>you have to believe that he has the power/money and the influence now to change things and set this world on a new path, I&#39;m not saying the guy is a saint, I&#39;m not even saying that he isn&#39;t corrupt. I&#39;m just saying that we should give him a chance before shitting on his head for every move he makes. Lets watch him, analyze him, scrutinize him but DAM man! just let him take his seat first for crying out loud! If he has turned on the establishment he&#39;s the best chance we have at fixing this piece of shit globe we live on!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t think it&#39;s right to draw such a straight line btw wealth and intelligence.  Trump couldn&#39;t get into UPenn/Wharton after high school so his daddy got him into Fordham, after a year of which he was able to transfer.  And that was at a time of much less competition in the college market. There are other significant factors, such as the wealth you&#39;re born into, luck, etc.  Most of you need to realIze that Trump&#39;s total worth is about $300m, based largely on trump tower.  His income for the past 15 years came mostly from a tv show.  So he&#39;s a tv star with real estate.  He has wrecked most of his other ventures besides trump tower, having to get bailed out by his dad and cronies.  He also hired a whole bunch of putin-puppets and enablers to help run his campaign.  You&#39;ve been deeply hoodwinked.</p>

If Trump was actually looking to &quot;drain the swamp&quot; (just vapid political / sales rhetoric), then he would have turned down Soros&#39; over one hundred million funding offer.</p>

<p>Of course he took the money. Now he&#39;s tied up with all the other blackmailed politicians to cover each other to delay the soon to crumble house of cards. They know this, and the Internet is allowing information to leak out, so they are delaying as long as TPTB can to perpetuate their international ponzi / RICO scheme for as long as possible. </p>

<p>TRUMP HAS A RECORD OF LIES AND MANIPULATION? WHAT BUSINESSMAN/POLITICIAN DOESN&#39;T?</p>

<p>Do you realize how many lies you need to tell on a DAILY basis to even consider running for president - or building your own business empire?</p>

<p>Let&#39;s take a look at OP&#39;s post. OP, have you ever lied before? The answer is yes. So why should we believe your post about DT &quot;betraying&quot; us? Do you understand how ironic this is?</p>

<p>OP: Donald Trump has a history of lying and manipulation. Believe what i&#39;m typing here. Do not believe Donald Trump.</p>

<p>Logic: Op, you also have a history of &quot;lying&quot; and manipulating things for your own benefit.</p>

<p>OP: Well logic, i&#39;m not the president of the US. Since Donald Trump has lied and manipulated before, he clearly has the WORST interests for our country in mind. He has lied before, AKA he will never try to do anything good for our country.</p>

<p>Logic: ....../facepalm</p>

<p>STOP THINKING IN BLACK AND WHITE. PERIOD. Yes, donald trump has told INNUMERABLE LIES. That does NOT MEAN he doesn&#39;t have the best interests of our country at stake.</p>

<p>OP is simply one of the countless pathetic &quot;woe is me and all of us&quot; type of people that, like a virus, has infiltrated online spreading their classic doomsday appeal. </p>

<p>Yeah, no shit Mr. Detective, trump doesn&#39;t tell the truth 100% of the time. Neither does anybody else. By your fucking metric of logic, humanity is doomed and NOTHING GOOD WILL EVER COME OF ANYTHING.</p>

<p>Trump is playing the game as carefully as he can. We need to LOOK PAST PEOPLE&#39;S track records of honesty, and start looking at the ideals that are springing out of this rapidly boiling pot.</p>

<p>The global elite have been REJECTED during this election. Trump represents IDEALS. He is not jesus incarnate, but his being elected sends a very clear message around this globe: the power of change is within the people&#39;s eye.</p>

<p>Suck my fucking cock and realize that we&#39;ve won this battle, you squirming little shill.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks for the sanity. This is the sad truth and the best comment in this thread. </p>

<p>Having worked in the system I know very well that Trump will not change much, there is far too much power and influence to even allow that even if he wanted to. Does he want to? Unlikely, Trump has wanted more than anything to be accepted by the elites his whole life, they always kept him on the outside and looked down on him and why he has that chip on his shoulder. </p>

<p>There does seem to be a very concerted effort to paint Trump voters as various things, the recent trend is that they think he is the 2nd coming and he&#39;s going to screw his voters. Yeah, no shit and if you are not cynical about our political system you&#39;re either very young or very stupid. Obama, whom I voted for, completely screwed over his voters whom were far more starry eyed about him than I see the average Trump voter being about Trump. </p>

<p>I voted Trump this time as despite what Trump is, the alternative was far far worse. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>stop whining you cry babies. Trump already has done more for the people of this country before he gets into office than Obama has done for 8 yrs. If you don&#39;t like who the middle class working folks put into office then my suggestion is pack your bags and get the fuck out  go live in another country for a bit to see what our country would have become if Clinton got in. I promise when you come back you will be kissing our asses for saving our country.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hillary would have been a continuation of current US policy. Trump will vastly overestimate US global military power to enforce US policy. He will attempt to run the US government like he ran his business. You see his reports of gross valuation as an impressive feat, and the way we worship wealth in this country, this makes him look as if he has some special skill or insight that will be used for America&#39;s benefit. What the people you hate have been telling you about him is actually true. He is a con man narcissist who is not interested in learning who is only in this for himself. This means that in practice he will ignore nonpartisan subject matter policy experts. His decisions will be made based on his own feelings rather than facts on the ground. It is difficult to know how exactly this will play out, I for one did not expect him to be played so easily by Taiwan. Allies have their own interests which do not align with our own. Without a realist at the helm, the ship of state is in for rough seas ahead. </p>

<p>The election game he won is nothing compared to the real world of 34D interdimensional chess that is international relations. </p>

<p>The main thing is long term decline of American power. Managing the rise of China is a complex operation. This is not a rival corporation that can be crushed. The rules of NY real estate and media manipulation do not apply. Just because you are great at picking up women, does not mean that you will win the respect and admiration of other men. China is their own man, not reliant on us as much as we think they are. Soft power is the name of the game, we are returning to a multipolar world. Asia is the future, and America wins by making the rules of the global game. You can&#39;t opt out of globalism, that is just declining to take a turn. </p>

<p>The problem is that of course globalism so far has only served the elite, they took out democracy and stopped any development of a true effective populist leader. Instead we have a bad impersonation of one. </p>

<p>So expect to see the deficit skyrocket within 8 years as he gives away as many public assets to the private sector as he can, making sure elites don&#39;t pay taxes, moving the burden of the military industrial complex to the already squeezed middle classes. Even though they now have total power they will blame Democrats for their actions. </p>

<p>The type of protectionist measures and confrontation will increase consumer prices chasing old industries. Our allies will move away from our sphere of influence because American dominance is based on the soft power of stability. An unpredictable Trump will lead friends and foes alike to cut us out across the world. He is used to negotiating from power, and the US actually has much less power than his voting block thinks it does. The stick is a weak tool compared to the carrot. We aren&#39;t going to war to save Taiwan. The real alphas who run other nations will have a great time gaming the pick up artist in chief. This means Pakistan will pursue its interests in Kashmir, Russia will take back as much of the USSR as it can, China will expand its influence in South East Asia, North Korea will troll harder, Islamic Jihadists will win over much more of the 1.6 billion Muslims that will attempt to engineer the clash of civilizations by getting America to repeat the mistakes of Iraq in Iran. The petrodollar that makes the goods and services cheap in America for no good reason will be broken when Europe, Russia, Saudi Arabia and China all decide to create a reserve currency not based on the dollar to buy oil, meaning that the US loses the control over our currency and interest rates skyrocket. Capital is the true owner of this world, and capital flight to more stable nations will leave the middle class absolutely demolished. </p>

<p>Long term this is a disaster, hopefully in the short term he fails quickly enough that the reigns of power are taken back by more responsible GOPers. </p>
