        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Apologies if this isn&#39;t the right sub...
Today two men in a personal vehicle (old jeep) cruised through the neighborhood before abruptly pulling into our driveway, and pulled out an extendable ladder. They propped the ladder onto a power line pole by our mailbox, and climbed up to where the transformer is housed. My husband saw them as he was leaving for work and asked what they were doing. They claimed to be contractors for the internet provider we use, but when asked for id or badges, they said they didn&#39;t have any. They got pretty defensive, and quickly worked on doing something to the wires. It was definitely suspicious to us because we live in a tucked away neighborhood. I called the internet provider to ask about it, and there were no work orders scheduled or reported on our property, and I was transferred to a supervisor who said that was completely out of the norm and that we should contact the police. The police came out, and we filed a report. We don&#39;t have cable, or phone lines-  just internet access.
 My question is what would someone be able to gain access to through the power lines/ internet cables? The power company, internet company, and police were very cautious and awkward..
What could be potentially gained from this? The guys with the ladder sped off in a hurry just after my husband walked to his truck to get a pen to take down the plate number (he got it either way). The cops said it&#39;s likely a bug of some kind or something to monitor internet data/passwords or info. The officers asked if someone was out to get us. The Jeep the guys used had tx plates, we&#39;re in VA. 
I don&#39;t know what to think of it, and neither does anyone else we&#39;ve talked to. My husband&#39;s all like &quot;well, your into conspiracies, so what does it mean&quot;?.
I&#39;m not in any way a paranoid person, even this doesn&#39;t worry me- I&#39;m just curious as to what it means- but I&#39;ve been looking into and researching a lot of shit, and it&#39;s a weird coincidence that this bizarre shit happened. 
Not trying to distract or post irrelevant shot, but wanted to share and see if anyone could help with what any of the above could possibly mean?
Thank you guys!
Edit: Friend came out, master electrician, checked it out, and there are cut and stripped wires which he said has been happening to people as a way to steal/hack info through data to obtain cc info.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sounds like a direct tap or monitoring device.  Was the box they worked on changed?  Can you see any new equipment?  This was trespassing, and you should have demanded they leave, while recording the whole incident.  Why does no vide exist of this interaction?  ALWAYS film everything.  </p>

<p>Be forceful with these criminals.  Inform then that they are trespassing, and tell them to leave your property IMMEDIATELY.  If they don&#39;t/won&#39;t, take appropriate actions to secure your property.</p>

Did the police check it out meaning did they call someone to take a look at what accrued or did they just assume? What did the police say they would do or you should do? Sorry for all the questions but I&#39;m just curious. Did the police check the plates to see who it connects too? It&#39;s just crazy that the police say it&#39;s odd but do nothing isn&#39;t it?

The police said they were going to run the tags, and put a BOLO out for the tags- which he said would stick out like a sore thumb being that it was a TX plate. And you&#39;re right about it being weird because every company is just completely dumbfounded, but didn&#39;t offer any information or investigation. You would think at least the power company would want to check their lines if there was suspected tampering. We just wound up getting a new router and changing all passwords through a different network. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ok, but that is a TV show. In real life, criminals are not stupid. CSI and Law and Order may want you to think that way, but there is a chain of command with criminals. Criminals who have a grow OP work for a bigger organization, and are given orders. They would never be given orders to do what OP has stated, in broad fuckin daylight (better means to an end). That is stupid. Meanwhile, the Sinoloa-Zetas cartel are building submarines, and the Crips, Bloods, and Counts (all working with Cartels and mobsters) are working with the CIA.

Some <em>gangs</em> are not as dumb because of hierarchy but dude it could be any random guys just stealing power for their small time grow. Anyways its not like I am saying that this is for sure whats going on but It sure could be. Man lol keep up the comedy routine though. </p>
