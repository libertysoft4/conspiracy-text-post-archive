    <div class="md"><p>Give it time, perhaps things in that regard will change after 6 months or so. A <em>lot</em> of people got extremely hyped for Trump and threw their hopeful hats in full-boar in support of him. They really wanted to believe the notion that one person could not only single-handedly out-maneuver the entire corrupt establishment, but also single-handedly clean up all the problems in the government. Wouldn&#39;t it be nice if that were true? It&#39;s understandable how so many people fell so hard for this temptation. I&#39;ll even toss myself out there as someone who felt a surge of hope, despite knowing the reality of the situation. </p>

<p>Now most of these people are in the midst of being severely let down, which means that on top of the cognitive dissonance, they are also dealing with feeling crushed, and also the big bruise on their egos of having passionately insisted that Trump would save the day or &quot;drain the swamp&quot; and are now turning out to have been obviously wrong. So they have to sort out the hysterical hype and confusion and get it out of their system, process the ramifications of being let down <em>again</em>, and lick the wounds of their ego. </p>

<p>Perhaps with time they will be able to come around.</p>

Democrats were let down by Obama but won&#39;t admit it. Republicans were let down by bush but won&#39;t admit it. It&#39;s a cycle and if you don&#39;t see that then you are the one that is wrong. And unfortunately for you, the trump supporters are right this time. Why?. Because they won. History is written by the victors.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>dude it&#39;s not even your game, your playing in someone else&#39;s ball court, with someone else&#39;s rules. this isn&#39;t your game, and it isn&#39;t your court. Why the hell are you trying to claim you own this game when you dont? none of us do. You are deceiving yourself man. It can&#39;t mean anything to you because its not even in your purview. You have been just given some ideas of what it is though spells. It paints a limited picture because they know how to cast spells and you dont know the language, but you are talking and acting like you know the language.</p>

<p>Its the same fucking thing like going to court and being asked how do you plead?
Who here even knows how to answer that question? They already set you up as a beggar, and subject to their jurisdiction before you open your mouth.
If you dont know how to handle that, you shouldn&#39;t even be fucking with politics, because politics is much worse than that. Voting means to vow, to pledge, or to promise something of yourself in return for giving up your rights and freedoms. Its not a freeing act, its an enslavement act.</p>

<p>I&#39;m probably going to have to write up a post about this because I see way to many people misinformed about politics and what it really is.</p>

<p>I&#39;m worried its going to get downvoted before I gets a chance to be read though, if anybody has any ideas let me know.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Because its not necessarily indicative of what is going to happen, whether for good or bad.  Personally, if I won an election that was run on the pretense of draining the swamp and ending special interests, I would absolutely appoint people to my cabinet who were very experienced and who came from those walks of life, such that they understood the grimy inner workings of the system.  I can see why people are upset about the choices, but the selections make sense to me.  But just like anybody else, its too early to tell if they will truly use their positions for good and to achieve what they said they would do.</p>

<p>Another thing worth noting is that the media has been relentlessly attacking Trump and the people that he is appointing - thats always a good sign in my eyes</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Approval rating?  If they conduct those similar to election polls then it means nothing.  And no, i think they legitimately hate Trump because they are in somebody else&#39;s pocket.  Not saying Trump is Jesus Christ, but I think he will act unabridged against their interests as of right now.</p>

<p>If they wanted really wanted Trump to win the election, wouldn&#39;t it be easier, cheaper and more effective to just actually report Hillary&#39;s illegal activity?  Project veritas?  Clinton Foundation?  All of that shit.  Thats a much easier path to victory that would actually affect a large portion of the population.

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s only a good sign for someone that bought into the narrative. They use the media to play both sides of the spectrum to get the public on board. It&#39;s been happening for so long people and still think &quot;well if the msm is attacking him he must be legit&quot; that system is run by engineers of public perception. Do you actually think they are stupid enough to play a one sided game? No they have to play both spectrums to limit the scope of the debate. Please wake the fuck up.

    <div class="md"><p>Look, we can doubt motives, but I never doubt patterns. And IMHO we have a pattern that has been going on for many many years now. Patterns don&#39;t change unless the paradigm in which their created have changed. Now if you can sit here and tell me the paradigm of our current corporate/political culture has changed, them I&#39;m gonna feel like you are not being aware of what is going on around you..</p>

<p>Stop looking at the words that are coming out of these politicians mouths and start looking at the patterns all around you. They haven&#39;t changed one bit. Until they do I really feel like it&#39;s premature to think anything is different. We should act accordingly.</p>

<p>i could even admit that he might do something that on the surface looks good, but you have to follow the end game. The guys that run government are experts and controlling the narrative, they have tools beyond your comprehension if you haven&#39;t been keeping up with what is going on.</p>

<p>The actions, behind the man is what we need to be looking for. Stop focusing on words, they mean absolutely nothing in politics. In fact they are even used as a code to say something entirely different to a completely different audience.</p>

<p>This is all based on my discovery of the etymology of the words people in power use. You have to understand the language they are speaking without synonyms. <a href="http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?allowed_in_frame=0&amp;amp;search=doctrine">Start looking up the originating mean of particular words</a>, it paints a much different picture that most people are aware of. If you dont know the true meaning of English words you are out of the loop entirely and being deceived without your knowledge.</p>

<p>P.S: I always admit when im wrong, but I dont think im wrong about politics and government. There are not many people speaking about what I learned IMHO. more people should be looking at this angle.</p>
