This is a decent info image on Pizzagate to spread around.</p>

<p>The moment I noticed it was missing, I checked the new section for the_donald, and someone had left the archived thread link in a comment, posted below this paragraph. The post made it to a little over 4 hours old and had over 5k upvotes, then poof. It was moderator removed due to being off topic. And granted, the screen cap says little more than &quot;there will be an attack on alfantis or a Podesta brother.&quot; Still though, for them to allow something like this to remain for so long, and to make the top of r/all, it only raises questions. If anything, this post might get to the top of r/all and we see what happens. This is a throw away, no karma for me. At the very least, it keeps pizzagate in people&#39;s minds, and hopefully reminds everyone that there are always two sides to a story. </p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161205233930/https://www.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/5gnsx2/4chan_called_it_a_day_before_it_happened/">https://web.archive.org/web/20161205233930/https://www.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/5gnsx2/4chan_called_it_a_day_before_it_happened/</a></p>

<p>The most interesting link in the thread is the IMDB page of the man who committed the attack:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm2625901/?ref_=nv_sr_1">http://www.imdb.com/name/nm2625901/?ref_=nv_sr_1</a></p>

<p>Edit: I&#39;m watching the downvotes start coming in, already 20% downvoted. Would love to know why. /s</p>

<p>Edit2: link to mod on why the post was removed:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/5gnsx2/4chan_called_it_a_day_before_it_happened/dau3c0g/">https://www.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/5gnsx2/4chan_called_it_a_day_before_it_happened/dau3c0g/</a></p>

<p>Edit3: This post has gained a fair bit of traction and I have been actively replying to everyone I could get to. I would like to reiterate that the point of this post is not to prove pizzagate is real, and it is also not to prove the_donald should have left this post up. If anything, they left it up as long as they could. This post is to further the discussion of pizzagate and related items. This 4chan post is by no means the nail in any coffin; most importantly, it makes us ask questions. And that is why we are here.</p>

<p>There it is. They allowed pizza gate related posts before the election, and the only reason I can see for them to remove it is to either call more attention to it, or they are scared to lose the rest of their sub to the admins. Either way, maybe if this post gets front page, we will at least get more visibility. I have no need for karma on this account.</p>

<p>pretty sure its this. <a href="/r/pizzagate">/r/pizzagate</a> was banned, if everyone just posts everything pizza related to T_D, T_D will definitely get banned for that reason. its not that the TD mods dont care about pizzagate, they just want to keep the sub up as long as possible. </p>

<p>Count how many times they say - &quot;fake news&quot;
Observe how they say the story originated.
Listen to what they call &quot;facts&quot;
See how they describe 4chan &amp; The Donald 
Look at the examples of &quot;debunking&quot; and &quot;
the twitter account expressing &quot;regret&quot; they use</p>

<p>Then tell me based on what you actually know, that this whole piece, written by the BBC - Britains national broadcasting company- isn&#39;t an cover up written expressly to cast doubt on everything related to Pizzagate?
The most telling thing is the language -
Here&#39;s another BBC article on Trump &amp; China -

- notice the complete absence of any subjective language? This is how the BBC normally presents its articles- articulate, informative, credible sources etc
The Pizzagate piece was shameless propaganda - they pushed a narrative not the actual story. To omit large swathes of pertinent info, as they did, suggests they&#39;re aware of it and covered it up. I&#39;ve challenged people who don&#39;t believe in Pizzagate using this argument and have yet to receive any confident rebuttals..</p>

<p>In case you where wondering how high this goes ...</p>

<p>Edit -
<a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-38209665">Here&#39;s the story they ran on an actual fake enterprise - The Fake US Embassy in Ghana</a> </p>

<p>Look at the level of detail they use to explain the scam- the language, sources cited, fully comprehensive working explanation of the scam itself - this is how the BBC normally writes. Not vague, conjecture filled, heavily opinionated hit pieces like the one above.  </p>

<p>So why have they done this?
If the Pizzagate article was written in as much depth, with the clarity that the BBC is capable of - then everyone who read the story would know it&#39;s real. The piece they wrote? Well, that&#39;s clearly a fake news story, dreamt up by racists on 4chan to discredit HIllary Clinton. Right?</p>

<p>So why have they done this?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Because everything is just small bits and pieces of circumstance. You can&#39;t prove that an email about a napkin isn&#39;t about raping children, and that&#39;s all the Pizzagate case is. The article even mentions things like:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It&#39;s known, for instance that Bill Clinton and Donald Trump flew on the private plane of convicted child abuser Jeffery Epstein.</p>

<p>Tony Podesta, the brother of the Clinton aide whose emails were hacked, was a friend of Dennis Hastert, a Republican politician who earlier this year was sentenced to 15 months in prison, and has admitted abusing boys.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What other real facts are there? The logo of a Pizza place looks like a pizza? Parents call their kids entertainment? Hots dogs are ordered for a fundraiser?</p>

<p>Consider it from another angle: what would convince you that there is no conspiracy?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;ve skirted over the crux of my point and moved straight into yours. Did you read the piece? Then my post? Did you see what i wrote about the biased, subjective language used in the Pizzagate article compared to the BBCs usual content? Did you read the part of the article where they fail to conduct any kind of meaningful examination of the story, as they paint it as a right wing conspiracy from top to bottom? The nuggets of truth they do give you are carefully packaged and placed at the end of the article, after multiple &#39;fake news&#39;&#39;s &amp;amp; several &#39;conspiracy theory&#39;&#39;s</p>

<p>Im from the Uk and <a href="https://www.sott.net/article/253598-The-BBC-Protecting-Pedophiles-and-War-Criminals-Since-2004">this isn&#39;t the first time the BBC has come out on the side of peadophiles.</a> </p>

<p>I write for a living and know when I&#39;m being told a story. Heavy on opinions - scant on facts. The facts they do offer are ones people who don&#39;t know the context, are meant to jump on as signs of veracity. As you&#39;ve done.</p>

<p>If you conduct even the most cursory research into peadophilia involving the elites in the U.K., and US, you&#39;ll read things that could, and were written off as coincidence and lies. But collectively, how much of a coincidence can it be? All these rich, powerful people keep getting attached to peadophilia, with investigators or whistleblowers mysteriously dying. If a regular person had allegations like that floating around them, would you be as keen to ignore the litany of evidence, and right it off as pure circumstance? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I did read it. It&#39;s subjective because there&#39;s nothing to be objective about. There are next to no actual, hard facts about Pizzagate. If there were it would be taken seriously outside of message boards on the internet.</p>

<p>I would be convinced there&#39;s something to it when a victim comes forward, or some other compelling evidence a crime was committed is found. Maybe an email explicitly talking about pedophilia. </p>

<p>I&#39;ve found name calling to be quite ineffective at changing peoples opinions. 
When I googled Trump rape charges dropped, I found the following articles. First 5 in the list were from the following news sites. (not sure if links are ok here or not)</p>

<p>Politico,
ljr,
Snopes,
dailymail.uk,
People</p>

<p>All were articles about women dropping their suits.
It seems logical to assume that the accusations were manufactured in an attempt to damage a candidates reputation before an election.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Trumpers afraid?</p>

<p>Lad, I voted Trump and if there were actual, hard evidence that he was involved I would take him down along with the rest. There has been no proof of that so far though. In fact Trump banned Jeffery Epstein from his Mar A Lago club for hitting on a teenage girl. There are certainly pedos on the Conservative side, just look at Mark Foley and Dennis Hastert. Ben Sasse is in hot water in my opinion because he ran the same program that Foley did.</p>

<p>The truth is more important than one&#39;s preferences or worldview.</p>

<p>And trump said this before the pedo scandal:
“I’ve known Jeff for fifteen years. Terrific guy,  He’s a lot of fun to be with. It is even said that he likes beautiful women as much as I do, and many of them are on the younger side. No doubt about it — Jeffrey enjoys his social life.”</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Regarding the Trump quote, thats just New Yorker talk.  When you bash someone you couch it in a compliment.  Make no mistake, Trump is bashing Epstein in that quote, he is basically calling him out as a pedo.</p>

<p>and many of them are on the younger side.  No doubt about it, Jeffrey enjoys his social life.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>

<p>Regarding the lawsuit, it was dropped before the Nov 8 election and was likely just a political smear tactic.  It was a lawsuit in civil court that was dropped before even being heard, and dropped without any comment as to why it was dropped. </p>

<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>

<p>FYI, I could file the same exact lawsuit in civil court against you tomorrow alleging the same thing, does that make you a pedo?  </p>

<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>

<p>There is a reason there was no police report, the victim was anonymous, the suit was filed in civil court with no accompanying criminal charges or police reports and was filed 22 years after the alleged incident, and the civil suit was dropped without comment before even having a chance to be heard...  </p>

<p>No it&#39;s not. It&#39;s Vice reporting an unnamed lawyer claiming that &quot;Trump broke ties with Epstein after Epstein tried to pick up the underage daughter of a Mar-A-Lago club member&quot;. Vice also notes that the <em>New York Post</em> had a different version (that Epstein hit on a masseuse).</p>

<p>Also, one person cannot be an echo chamber.  I do not think you understand what an echo chamber is, maybe you should look it up so you can avoid places where all your views are considered realistic and not challenged in the slightest way. When you only discuss these events in an echo chamber you leave no room for intellectual growth. You are limiting your ability to learn something new. </p>

<p>Dealing with personal information, you guys have consistently taken random names out of the emails that are not in the news or media. This has resulted in random people being harrassed. Im not saying this sub did that im saying people who are involved in the whole pizzagate conspiracy. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re not adding anything new, you&#39;re dismissing it entirely based off of your own research. Furthermore, the question is not whether or not pizzagate is real. The question is how far reaching is it. </p>

<p>I have not taken the time to save links or build timelines as others have. I have seen enough to be convinced that there is something huge going on, and it is greatly affecting the children of the world negatively. At this point, it&#39;s hardly debatable that something is going on. There are simply too many unanswered questions. </p>

<p>As everyone is, you are welcome to your opinion.

    <div class="md"><p>Will you agree with me that no major news network has done an actual investigation into pizzagate? Can you show me one major news network who said &quot;yeah we looked into it, it&#39;s not real and here&#39;s why&quot;?</p>

<p>It cannot be done, solely because the media reported it as fake to begin with. Even if this whole event is blown out of proportion, why can&#39;t you admit that SOMETHING is going on, and it&#39;s related to missing children? </p>

<p>I am trying to chose my words carefully because I have not taken the time to collect the evidence I have personally seen, and this is my fault. I&#39;m not asking you to take my word on it and clearly you disagree with me on the ground level. You claim to have done your research as I have claimed to do mine. As many people here have done, i have come to the conclusion that something is going on, it&#39;s dark, and Its being covered up. </p>

<p>I am not here to attack you personally, and I really wish I had the time to find the things I have seen, because although I hate using the word &quot;feel&quot;, I do feel that most would, at the very least, agree that there is something big happening here. </p>

<p>As for doxxing, once again, individual people sitting behind Reddit accounts would have posted the names and information, and anyone deciding to act on that information does so on their own free will, that cannot be argued. Such as the Boston bombing incident and &quot;we did it Reddit.&quot;  Those were personal decisions through and through, and better choices could have been made.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You said you don&#39;t believe it needs investigating so what more can I do? If you&#39;re looking for some kind of study of the amount of pedophiles in the elites of course it doesn&#39;t exist. So I don&#39;t have statistics to back it up. </p>

<p>So you&#39;re right I shouldn&#39;t have presented it in that way I should have said &quot;In fact throughout history ELITES have been raping kids in a lot of cases, it certainly seems more common among them than among regular people.&quot;</p>

<p>However it is a fair thing to say imo. Just like it would be fair to say it&#39;s more common in the Catholic church even though I don&#39;t have statistics for that either.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well pizzagate seems to imply an elite upper circle of &quot;chosen&quot; people use blackmail to keep people in check. And the best blackmail is child porn and murder of course.</p>

<p>In this world supposedly you have to &quot;pay to play&quot;. So if you want to be successful and be near powerful people all the time. You need to be blackmailed in case you feel like letting some things off your chest. And thats what I feel his involvement is. </p>

<p>He is aware and is blackmailed but I think either its not that bad and he can still bust them, or he is corrupt and the power struggle behind the scenes is switching from hillary&#39;s sinking ship to the trump machine. </p>

<p>But it is funny watching the bush CIA dynasty struggle to figure out why their Operation Mockingbird plans from 20+ years ago might be starting to fail. And the quick and rushed MSM stories pushing a narrative are so telling its funny. BUT they doubled down on this strategy and it makes it twice as bad..</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Someone who I&#39;ve been discussing this with had a good point. If there are so many people involved and it goes to the highest levels, and theres purportedly all of this blackmail that we can assume is physical evidence, then how can anyone, possibly close to their own deathbed, not release what they know? Why hasn&#39;t anyone else made a deadman switch. Why has not one person at the top said &quot;fuck the system, I don&#39;t care what people think, here&#39;s what I have&quot;? It felt like a very fair question. We have all of these road maps, time lines, and connected dots, but how can there be no physical or even video evidence? How can it be so well hidden? </p>

<p>I&#39;m not expecting answers to those questions, those are now what I&#39;m asking myself. Something will surface, I&#39;m sure. But it begs the question, why hasn&#39;t it happened yet, in my opinion. It just feels like there&#39;s something so much bigger going on.

    <div class="md"><p>Yes it&#39;s true that the evidence would be illegal, but wouldn&#39;t you agree it depends on WHO exactly is in the video? If it&#39;s a big, household name, then it doesn&#39;t matter who has the video. It&#39;s not random porn, it would potentially be of a public figure.</p>

<p>And having kids has absolutely nothing to do with it, that&#39;s merely one circumstance. You&#39;re telling me that every person involved in this scandal from the beginning has kids? There&#39;s plenty of single politicians and people in power. I refuse to believe self preservation would be the driving force for every single person involved. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That kind of assumes that the individual politicians actually have access to the blackmail material. If I were setting up the system, I would have only a few people at the very top with access to the actual blackmail evidence, and then you can have hundreds or thousands of people—the public figures such as politicians—implicated by the evidence, but they can&#39;t come forward because they don&#39;t have any of the evidence themselves. </p>

<p>If they did make a deathbed confession, it would be only be their word. They&#39;d likely only sully their own reputation by admitting to whatever acts they did, but no one would believe them, other than those people who already think such a system is in place. </p>

<p>BTW, lots of people in this thread say OP is involved in a child abduction from October.

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;Off Topic&quot; I&#39;ll take issue with that.</p>

<p>Doesn&#39;t look like you&#39;re a T_D poster so I&#39;ll get you up to speed: Before the mods were all swapped out and pizza gate was in its infancy this and SpiritCooking was a huge angle we used to undermine latino support for Clinton. </p>

<p>Some of us believed it, some people didn&#39;t, but we pushed it like crazy because we believed it would be effective. I think it may have played a small role in helping Trump but since we don&#39;t have our own exit polls we will never know. But as T_D posters looked into the child trafficking more and more and started connecting dots it became pretty real. That&#39;s why even after we won we didn&#39;t pack up shop and stuck around to dig deeper. Then the admins and new mods stepped in. Suddenly it wasn&#39;t kosher to talk about sex trafficking and all the threads were locked.</p>

<p>Spez, who defended pedophile subreddits as &quot;free speech&quot;, is likely the person pressuring T_D to &quot;shut it down&quot;. Now I happen to notice the mods have been letting the threads get some momentum underneath them before locking them which may be our own version of 4D chess. Regardless, people on T_D need to understand that they are either going to be shutdown or they are going to be neutered over time to the point the subreddit is a shell of itself.</p>

<p>I feel like they are more afraid of getting quarantine rather than a ban. If they get quarantine, they couldnt said that the mods banned them because of free speech and their speech couldnt reach the others. They are very cautious about their step anyway.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Your first point is valid, very valid. But let me ask you one counter point. Why would they allow the post to not only be at the top of r/all, but also last 4+ hours? If the mods want to stick to their rules, they had an ample amount of time to do so before this was seen by a large portion of their group. </p>

<p>You&#39;re also right, someone may have had a good &quot;guess,&quot; but even so, how can you not look upon the mainstream media with disdain for how they have treated it? If a man with a gun came into one of my establishments, I would at least try to find out why. This is not the case, as mainstream media immediately reported the pizza gate scandal as being &quot;fake news&quot; before there was ever any &quot;investigation&quot; from the media. </p>

<p>What this does is raise questions and awareness for he situation, and that&#39;s all I can ask for. </p>

You keep saying &quot;you&quot; in your post, and none if it applies to anything I myself, once again, have said. You are choosing to dismiss it entirely based off of clearly what little you have seen. This is not a discussion of whether pizzagate is real or not, this is a discussion of how far reaching it is. Each of us here has looked at the evidence and has chosen to continually keep looking deeper, and there are connections that are undeniable. I have not taken the time to save my research or where my rabbit holes have taken me because I simply don&#39;t have the time to refute every claim. What&#39;s astonishing is how you take your time to try and discredit some of the least important aspects of this entire pizza gate issue, of which I never mentioned personally.</p>

The media should have been taking the lead, lets get some warrants, kick down a few doors, and confiscate a few computers and see what happens.

Pizzagate is positing that specific, <em>real</em> people are behind very serious, very heinous crimes. And they&#39;re positing these things with absolutely no evidence whatsoever. Not even a tiny bit of reasonable evidence. And the &quot;we&#39;re just asking question&quot; facade hasn&#39;t fooled anybody for 60 years. You&#39;re not just asking questions, you&#39;re levying real accusations against real people. Honestly, it&#39;s gone past &#39;accusing&#39; and has stepped far into simply just stating &quot;these people did these things.&quot;</p>

<p>Those of us who aren&#39;t <em>batshit fucking insane</em> have been saying since the very beginning how outrageously dangerous and unacceptable this is.

    <div class="md"><p>How else is investigative work done? Does one blindly stumble over real actual evidence such as walking into the actual event? Or does one find interesting information that subtly implies meaning and eventual facts with further digging? Maybe both or do the crime tv shows not show the smaller and slow evidence build up portion? Additionally, many of these researchers who are involved are amateurs with little more resources than the internet. Bizarre conversations, images and artwork sound like simple clues related to those one would stumble over if one was part of a story of Scooby Doo. No one in their right minds would openly use a symbol that the FBI has openly deemed as the symbol for pedophilia. Just like the Instagram default image of the statue to the tweeny who is the image of political pedophilia. People can have their own opinions about what&#39;s going on, everyone has their own asshole. Facts are facts, these are really bizarre. I don&#39;t believe one way or another. I look at the facts and say, huh... Interesting. The media can say what it wants, it always does because it&#39;s a attention whore. Podesta never thought his private emails would become public in this way. Stop trying to threaten me with your foolish opinions and logical fallacies of &quot;oh, I think that&#39;s laughable, your opinion is stupid to me and so are the facts your putting forth.&quot; It has no affect on me. I refuse to either dismiss or be a continuation of these topics but I tend to have an issue when it&#39;s obvious there&#39;s some sort of cover-up. When I say cover-up, I mean, these facts have come to light and yet no legitimate investigation has come about to look into these strange occurrences and the media is openly denying it without anybody actually involved batting an eye. That&#39;s a cover-up. I understand pedophilia is no joke. I&#39;m not concluding these people are to blame for such activities. When facts like these come to light, it&#39;s worth having an open mind and taking a look.</p>

<p>Honestly the only thing that looks bizarre about the emails is they talk like old people who are foreign to technology. It really reminds me of <a href="/r/oldpeoplefacebook">/r/oldpeoplefacebook</a></p>

<p>If you have anything that actually needs to be looked at please please bring it to light, no one is saying that child trafficking is okay and pretty much the entire population except for the sick few is against it and pedophilia entirely. It is something that people stand up for.  I can&#39;t fathom that it goes as deep as described by the conspiracy without someone standing up and saying something. How the hell would they even screen someone to bring them into their sick world without them going public on the whole situation. The real questions that need to be asked are pretty obvious but they don&#39;t fit the conspiracy narrative unfortunately. </p>

<p>thats not how it works.</p>

<p>CPP is just one node of a network of associates that share a &#39;hobby&#39;.</p>

<p>CPP is likely more part of the Washington gay scene than the pedo scene, but not to say they don&#39;t overlap, maybe at CPP.</p>

<p>Reddit (VIPs) itself has connections to one of the Washington gay cafes. photo of a certain person with friends.</p>

<p>thats what r/pizzagate then r/T_D was pointing out. why <a href="/r/pizzagate">/r/pizzagate</a> got removed.</p>

<p>the &#39;spirit cooking&#39; things is occult and weird, part of a financial scam and also conditioning of idiot VIP celebs.</p>

<p>it overlaps with the two above scenes.</p>

<p>Pizzagate is no longer a question of whether or not it is real, it is a question of how big and far reaching it is. </p>

<p>I am not asking for blind faith. I am not asking for you to take my word on it. As I have stated before I have not taken the time to save my searches or the information that has lead me and many other to conclude the seriousness of pizzagate. I merely ask that you keep an open mind, and when you hear something or someone claim that pizza gate is false, you at least look into the specific claim yourself. </p>

Of course, this is not &quot;proof&quot; of anything, but it OPENS THE DOOR TO QUESTIONS BASED IN FACT, not senselessly asking someone if they raped someone because we don&#39;t know where they were on a certain day.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>And this is the &quot;we&#39;re getting deeper&quot; part. For something of this nature to be hidden for so long and the information controlled so well, why would these secretive government agencies post documents about the very thing they&#39;re covering up? If it&#39;s never written down, it can&#39;t be pinned as fact without hard evidence. The double speak is only one piece of this large and intricate puzzle that you&#39;re focusing on, and that&#39;s fine, but without it, how can you explain away the rest of what is pictured?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This subreddit is nowhere close to disliked as that sub. In fact, from my personal experience, most non-conspiracy-theorizing redditors find this an interesting and intriguing escape, filled with civil people discussing what the mainstream would deem to be fringey stuff. But coool and fun nonetheless. Sure there are naturally going to be people who look down at conspiracy groups wherever they are, but ...</p>

<p>...have you been to r/the_donald? That place is a nasty cesspool constantly trying to provoke and instigate the rest of reddit. They constantly ban people that show just a mild semblance of not acting like an over the top rally-er. They&#39;re constantly sharing actual fake news. Check out the post about Norway deporting Muslims and crime dropping 30%. There are long time r/the_donald users who are begging people to recognize this is literally fake news from a random blog, and the subreddit is more or less telling them to shut up.</p>

<p>That place isn&#39;t even being mistreated 
... yet. 90% of their posts that would reach top 100 in r/all would have like 50-60 comments. They found cheap ways to get easy recognition, they&#39;ve never showed even hints of cooperation or discussion with the outside world. Even hyper partisan places like r/conservative, r/hillaryforpresident or r/sandersforpresident were nothing like r/the_donald. Honestly, any level headed person sifting through that subreddit should pretty quickly recognize that people there are interested mainly if having fun by being trolls.</p>

<p>Sometimes I find it hard to believe that that subreddit hasn&#39;t been taken over by liberal/libertarian/center-right trolls trying to smear the image of Trump supporters. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I looked through all of that as someone on the fence with pizzagate and none of that is concrete. Some are suspicious, but some of those other instances have been debunked like the &quot;it couldnt get better than this&quot; image. You guys are just grasping at straws and seeing that James guy from Comets ping pong walk those 2 through his business tells me hes not hiding anything, rather hes at his wits end and wants the public to stop harassing him. Are some of the images questionable? Definitely. Do they prove anything? Not at all. </p>

<p>I believed in the possibility of Comet ping pong being involved at the beginning, but with more and more &quot;evidence&quot; (as you call it) coming out, I stray farther and farther from that conclusion. </p>

<p>But its your life, feel free to go down this rabbit hole and waste hours, if not days, harassing a pizza shop owner. If Im wrong about this, then so be it, Im not going to hinder your investigation,  but I will put my foot down when people actually find its necessary to travel hours away and harass the man, and call you all impulsive fools. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thank you. </p>

<p>I have some problems with it, though. The first links are quite credible. I am convinced that elite pedophile rings exist. There are a lot of pedos in the world, ten minutes on the dark web can prove that. Some pedos will surely be elites - just like some murderers are elites, some thieves are elite, some people with green eyes are elites - it&#39;s just statistical dispersion. It also follows that elites (unlike blue collar pedos) have the power to cover it up and get away with it. So it makes sense that there are elite pedo rings. Further, there is proof - the Marc Dutroux evidence, the Omaha Boy&#39;s Town scandal, etc., which are included. </p>

<p>So &quot;elite pedo rings exist&quot;, check. </p>

<p>The satanic cult claims are harder to swallow. I&#39;ve seen the Bohemian Grove footage. I know they get into that kind of thing. But that isn&#39;t really Satanism, it&#39;s more paganism. And a lot of that seems explainable - people like that in situations like that do a lot of weird shit. I think when you&#39;re crazy rich and powerful, the normal kind of things get boring. It&#39;s also metaphorical, just like any religion. I&#39;m not really convinced that these people are actually full-on believers and do what they do in order to please Moloch or whatever (although it&#39;s pretty believable that Hitler was all in on the occult, and that some of his beliefs and supporters made their way into the US gov&#39;t after the war). But that&#39;s not totally relevant - whether they do it for weird religious beliefs or just because they are pervs doesn&#39;t matter much to me. </p>

<p>I spent a lot of time with artists. The stuff about &#39;spiritcooking&#39; is not that unusual in some crowds. It&#39;s kind of like a IRL version of watching a horror film or sci-fi series most of the time - basically just for fun, but maybe crosses a line. I don&#39;t take it very seriously because I&#39;ve been around some similar kinds of things. Same with the art and music in Comet Ping Pong - essentially it&#39;s just bad taste (although those things will occasionally draw people who are totally serious about it and are truly sick, the artwork of Sally Mann comes to mind as legit art that attracts pedos). But I am open to it being more than that, because if you do have an elite pedo ring they probably <em>do</em> have creepy art on their walls (and probably do collect Sally Mann photos). It&#39;s just that <em>that</em> evidence is circumstantial at best. </p>

<p>The whole &quot;cheeze pizza&quot; thing is silly IMO, because it&#39;s a damn pizza place and that term originated on 4chan anyway - the same place that the whole pizzagate story originated from (I think). <em>Maybe</em> it&#39;s a link, but I think it&#39;s probably not. This stuff is where I get frustrated - it&#39;s a pizza place, someone mentioning pizza or cheese or pasta on their twitter isn&#39;t damning. That stuff just seems to discredit the better evidence. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>We plan to heat the pool, so a swim is a possibility. Bonnie will be Uber Service to transport Ruby, Emerson, and Maeve Luzzatto (11, 9, and almost 7) so you’ll have some further entertainment, and they will be in that pool for sure. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>(from an email leak) This sounds pretty damning. I&#39;m trying to be skeptical and think of how it could be just poor wording or something, but yikes. I&#39;m having trouble doing so. Alone, I can pass it off as just a poorly written sentence but it sure sounds like they are delivering children as &quot;entertainment&quot;.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>A worthy leaked government email to check out where pizza is obviously a code word: &quot;Who all is in the Austin office today who is going to want pizza? We only have one slice and we need to know how thinly to slice it...Simply send a single response, filed, color-coded, double-sided and appropriately labeled, signed in triplicate and set on fire.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>that seems like an obvious joke to me about red tape and bureaucracy. </p>

<p>So I do see some good evidence, it&#39;s just that there also is a bit of not-so-good evidence mixed in. And people here seem to focus on the not-so-good kind. We should try to focus on the things like the people involved who have been imprisoned for pedo related activity, not the 3 degrees of separation to a person who makes creepy cakes evidence. </p>

<p>I&#39;ll have to spend some more time reading these links. Thanks for posting it though, pretty much what I&#39;ve been looking for. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>There are many other threads about it.  Search twittergate, especially on voat.  The links were all there, and the admins (not mods - admins) deleted the threads the day before they banned r/PG.  The threads from that day are archived over on voat.  I would link them but voat is blocked for me from work.</p>

<p>But be careful.  The proof threads have actual links to the CP twitter pages.  The voat threads are safe, but you&#39;re literally one link away from the real deal.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t doubt that lots of twitter users try to post CP. Pretty much every social medium has that problem. I also see that twitter looked pretty bad for allowing it to go on, and possibly even protecting them. What I don&#39;t see is how that is linked to Comet Ping Pong. Were the twitter pedos all also following CPP&#39;s twitter or something?</p>

<p>Did the reddit admins delete threads about it, or the voat admins - I couldn&#39;t tell from what you said. I&#39;m guessing you meant reddit admins. I guess that may be evidence that reddit is covering for pedos (or at least that it needs further research). </p>

<p>It&#39;s just that the most evidence I can find that Comet Ping Pong is a hive of pedos is:</p>

<p>they have creepy artwork </p>

<p>they had a creepy band play there</p>

<p>their logo looks like a pedo logo if you really, really try to see it</p>

<p>some cherry picked twitter pics that could either be bad jokes or bad jokes that betray a secret pedo tendency</p>

<p>and this one seems like &quot;pedos exist on twitter, and Comet Ping Pong exists on twitter, therefore they are linked&quot;.</p>

<p>FWIW, I absolutely believe there are elite pedo rings out there. The Franklin Boy&#39;s Town scandal, the Westminster pedo scandal, and that horrifying series of posts about a European (Austrian?) serial killer child rapist/torturer who was linked to VIPs pretty much convinced me of it. But with PG, I&#39;ve just seen mostly very circumstantial evidence and wild leaps of faith. </p>

<p>I honestly want to know the truth. I&#39;m just not willing to jump on a bandwagon and condemn people based on conjecture. I wish someone would compile a list of evidence that is beyond hipsters doing weird hipster stuff that seems kinda creepy. </p>

<p><del>Also, if someone has the link to that series of posts about the European serial killer, it would be great. My memory is terrible, but I remember it was very well researched and very credible.</del> </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Personally, I think Comet Ping Pong is just a pizza place, and not a hub of a Clinton backed elite ring, but at the same time, I also think that Alefantis himself is, at the very least, a welcoming friend to pedos in the area.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Let&#39;s make this very clear. There&#39;s 400,000 people subscribed to this subreddit.</p>

<p>There are about 125,000 schools in the US if you count both colleges as well as private and public K-12 schools.</p>

<p>If every single one of us chooses a different school and claims there&#39;s going to be a school shooting at the school we chose within the next month, chances are 12 of us would be right.</p>

<p>Keep in mind there are coincidences all the time, people will claim to predict things constantly and very likely will fail. Cherry picking a single comment buried beneath mountains of other comments and praising it for predicting the future is called Survivorship bias, and it&#39;s not at all a good way to think.</p>

<hr/>

<p>It&#39;s pretty obvious why t-d mods deleted that, it&#39;s because it isn&#39;t donald related and it&#39;s going to bring a lot of unwanted trouble if people start seeing pizza threads on t-d</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Wait a minute.</p>

<p>You think this guy going to prison refutes the legitimacy of his being a patsy? How in the slightest?</p>

<p>What if he had a deal made: 10 years for being the pizzagate shooter, or he goes down for 25 for whatever other real or fake crime he&#39;s been implicated of? Or his family will suffer worse?</p>

<p>Are you implying there&#39;s no incentive for people to go down as the fall guys for crimes, despite the fact that that happens every day?</p>

<p>The thing to consider here is that if you accept the premise of a systemic pedo ring for elites, the idea of a false flag crisis actor doing time in a cell is a VERY small obstacle to orchestrate at that point. If you can move mountains, you aren&#39;t hindered by the necessity to move hills.</p>

<p>I&#39;m starting to suspect the alternative archive websites common with izza gate, archive<strong>.fo</strong> and archive<strong>.fi</strong>, are collecting data on viewers. They force you through CloudFlare, requiring an analysis of your browser with Google&#39;s Recaptcha. They then block VPN/Proxy/Tor connections still. You have to be naked to view those archives. </p>

<p>While OP&#39;s wonderful use of the main official archive.org does not have any of these requirements.</p>

<p>Using a vpn or Tor is now probable cause to consider you a target by the NSA. So are many things, as you&#39;re obviously aware because you dropped the &#39;p&#39; in pizzagate. </p>

<p>If we spent our time talking about <em>credible</em> conspiracies, we may actually be able to get something done about it. But instead we&#39;re just discrediting ourselves on posts like this (I mean the &#39;4chan called it&#39; post you were replying to, not your comment). </p>

<p>It&#39;s like as soon as a conspiracy is proven true (NSA spying, US torturing captives, etc), we lose all interest in it and have to move on to aliens and illuminati pizza parties. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That was my post on 4chan. I made multiple threads about the potential for a falseflag and they all got slid. I&#39;ve been researching this shit since the beginning and I just want to remind everyone that they deliberately injected disinfo into the pizzagate discourse. Everything about the Mcann girl is disinfo and thats the bogus cointelpro lead they want us to invest our time into. They even reopened the Mcann investigation and make no mistake, this was done deliberately to make it look like you guys are onto something. It&#39;s bait, don&#39;t fall for it. Look into NCMEC/ICMEC and Laura Silsby. Also look into this connection </p>

<p>So post the fuckin undeniable irrefutable evidence and i&#39;ll look at it, and accept it, but guess what...what i&#39;ve seen so far (and trust me i&#39;ve looked at it) is on par with &quot;Obama is a secret muslim and &quot;was not born here&quot; - level of retarded accusations that right wing idiots make constantly.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>From what I understand, it boils down to everyone having blackmail on everyone. Whether or not it was the right time to bring it up is unimportant in my opinion. To me, it&#39;s about the amount of people exposed to it. The list of people saying &quot;I have never heard of pizzagate&quot; is growing shorter. Even if it&#39;s being reported as fake news, it might be enough for some people to start googling it and finding their own rabbit holes. And eventually when rock hard evidence is produced, we will see some sort of movement happen. And if people were exposed to it all along and it&#39;s not just coming up out of the blue, then people will ask more and more questions. And that&#39;s all anyone can ask for at this point.</p>

<p>As an experiment, I just created a new subreddit called <a href="/r/OpenSourceFreedom">/r/OpenSourceFreedom</a></p>

<p>I will keep this sub as free as possible,  as uncensored as possible, and it will be interesting to see if any cucks or government agents try to downvote en-masse or otherwise corrupt the Open Source Freedom sub. Please feel free to post away. I will do my best to never censor anything that is pro freedom.  Bear with me while I figure out this moderator task. </p>

I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if that sub has banned more users in the history of Reddit due to people saying something they don&#39;t agree with. t_d is the biggest &quot;safe space&quot; online while they claim safe spaces don&#39;t exist. Tell me again how that sub allows free speech?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Specifically, I said every post I MYSELF have said is clear and consistent. And it is. I am merely asking questions, and where the answers take me, I will go. You keep saying &quot;you&quot; in your post, and none if it applies to anything I myself, once again, have said. You are choosing to dismiss it entirely based off of clearly what little you have seen. This is not a discussion of whether pizzagate is real or not, this is a discussion of how far reaching it is. Each of us here has looked at the evidence and has chosen to continually keep looking deeper, and there are connections that are undeniable. I have not taken the time to save my research or where my rabbit holes have taken me because I simply don&#39;t have the time to refute every claim. What&#39;s astonishing is how you take your time to try and discredit some of the least important aspects of this entire pizza gate issue, of which I never mentioned personally.</p>

<p>At some point, someone told journalists there was funky shit going on in an imaginary triangle.

<p>Go draw a triangle around any of the other major shipping lanes in the world, tell journalists funky shit is going on, and they&#39;ll find the same thing.</p>

The hardest &quot;evidence&quot; is Bill Clinton used Epstein&#39;s jet on occasion, and even that doesn&#39;t imply guilt. Everything else is based on graffiti at a music venue, a rich guys art collection, out of context emails, and customer&#39;s pictures at said venue/pizza shop.</p>

<p>This conspiracy is just... Poor investigating. And I think it has a lot more to do with feelings than evidence.</p>
