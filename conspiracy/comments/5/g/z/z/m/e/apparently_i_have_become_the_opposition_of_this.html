    <div class="md"><p>Well explain to me the point and why its important? 
If you say its about saving kids from sexual abuse, this is why i have a hard time believing...
Somewhere in central Africa A UN peacekeeping convoy raped over 29 children and impregnated 9 minors. This barely got any mention here except for me posting it. 
Ive been researching these elite pedo rings for a long time. And for the sake of the kids that had been victimized, its wrong to claim shit without anybody speaking out. </p>

<p>That right there is pretty much the definition of ignorance...if you can&#39;t even see that, I really don&#39;t expect you to have any credibility in your assessment of pretty much anything.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve seen you post in here a lot lately, and I thought, with some things you say you may be pretty much on the right track – but then you make comments like this and your ignorance shows.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not knocking your opinion on the subject- you&#39;re entitled to believe whatever you want. But for you to assume you&#39;ve done &quot;more research than me (or whoever)&quot; is evidence of just how closed your mind really is.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>First of all, you forgot to change accounts. </p>

<p>Anyway- so you don&#39;t think there is anything worth looking into regarding the connection between the possible human trafficking operation uncovered in Hawaii and people within the Government? You don&#39;t find it funny that the same people suspected to be involved in child trafficking continuously turn up when new connections are uncovered? Confirmation bias is one thing, people like the Podestas, Sasha Lord, Dave Stone, and James Alefantis all being connected thru business interests while all separately having major red flags regarding child trafficking is not a &quot;coincidence.&quot; </p>

<p>I&#39;m just wondering how you came to your conclusion after &quot;all that exhaustive research you&#39;ve done that is clearly more in depth than anyone else.&quot; What would it take for you to support an investigation into the allegations, besides a mainstream media outlet deeming it acceptable?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ok that was kinda ignorant since there is no way we could prove it..but ive looked into every aspect of this, and if there was a accusation i would believe in a heartbeat because thats the final piece. 
Bu exposing this guy without any evidence to charge him, do you realize that he would probably murder his victims so they dont talk. </p>

<p>Ive talked to law enforcement about this and they say james alafantis is probably reading this sub, especially if he is guilty so he knows where to cover his tracks.</p>

<p>I would suggest studying history, read, take everything with a grain of salt, and look for hidden messages in the media.
They use reverse psychology and strawman theory&#39;s.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The Mob was only taken down with the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racketeer_Influenced_and_Corrupt_Organizations_Act">RICO</a> Laws. Why? Because all they had on the murderers, drug dealers, and gun runners was circumstantial evidence.</p>

<p>Come on now just because its circumstantial doesn&#39;t mean its not something substantial.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Like for real do you honestly think they will catch $hillary and Posteda raping a child while eating cheese pizza all while black mailing someone and ordering a hit? </p>

<p>Cause that&#39;s what your asking for. </p>

<p>These people are in deep. They run there shit like a Mafia if not like a deep state black project. Ultimately it would require authority&#39;s to actually use the laws at hand or create new ones to prosecute them on other crimes.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree that there isn&#39;t enough evidence to serve warrants, hand down indictments, or prosecute alleged parties. However, I feel that the amount of circumstantial evidence is compelling to warrant further investigation into this matter and larger associated matters. </p>

<p>I think the machine has been working out the kinks in the swiftness and effectiveness of the media for some time. Think to the coverage of the Mayalsian airplane, then to that of the rebel flag, now to this. </p>

<p>Create hysteria and consume the attention of the public; check. Direct that hysteria and attention towards pressuring legislators and State policy makers; check. </p>

<p>They&#39;ve been perfecting their methods for some time now, and I fear we&#39;re about to witness the effect of a &#39;live&#39; enactment. </p>

<p>I also think that communities such as r/conspiracy have a <em>huge</em> potential to help combat this type of manipulation of information, illustrated best by our power in numbers. This sub has 400K+ subscribers. Imagine if we were able to organize and concert our efforts of researching and fact checking into a centralized format to reach others. It&#39;d be like imagining CNN as having 400K writers on staff. </p>

<p>For anyone interested in furthering that conversation, I&#39;ve started a thread here: </p>
