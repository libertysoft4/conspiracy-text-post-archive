<blockquote>
<p>America has a child porn crisis. The disturbing number of federal and state employees arrested for child porn charges makes this a national security issue. Over the past few years, I’ve been documenting the scope of America’s child porn industry and the apparent level of involvement by America’s national security and federal employees. Forbes, The Washington Times and others have published my research. Fox News and Canadian TV (CTV) invited me for interviews. My CTV interview went mini-viral as did my Forbes article. I was the first to ask, in 2012, if White House staff might have been involved in the Colombia Secret Service scandal.
I am now researching and writing a book: Child Porn Nation: America’s Hidden Security Threat. My starting premise is men, and increasingly women, are raping children, very young children, including infants and toddlers, and sharing videos, images, and live-streaming of this abuse at epidemic levels. These criminals are, by and large, getting away with it because America refuses to move beyond our denial.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thats a huge logical fallacy.  Just because someone is successful and &quot;normal&quot; doesn&#39;t mean they can&#39;t be pedaphiles and just because some is a &quot;weirdo&quot; doesn&#39;t make them a pedophile.  Its the same reason why some of the most likeable people are serial killers amd sociapaths.  Its often the most seemingly &quot;normal&quot; people that are into some serious dark shit</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You do realize that they have already proved this whole &quot;only weirdos are into kiddy porn/pedophilia&quot; worng like 15 years ago.  You&#39;re trying to categorize people into perfectly fit boxes and thats not how it works.  Think about this for a second, if only 1% of the world were pedaphiles, thats 70 million people.  Look at the Catholic church as a perfect example.  Preists, respected members of a community that used their power to do terrible things.  Thats not an &quot;outlier&quot;.

It&#39;s important people understand not only that bad things are happening, but why they happen.

<p>Maybe you need to take off the naive goggles you&#39;re wearing and realize a public image and private life are absolutely not the same. Pedos don&#39;t have a schema that can be outwardly judged. Nobody &quot;looks&quot; like a pedo until after they&#39;re caught. </p>

<p>Any bell curve will always be inaccurate unless data on everyone is collected and analyzed. Bell curves can never take into account those who are never caught.  </p>

<p>At least nothing that&#39;s publicly acceptable.  </p>

<p>I genuinely believe that, psychologically, when an individual spends enough time at a place in their life where nothing is out of their reach--they can afford any purchase, they have influence, people will do things for them, they can get sex from pretty much anyone they want--that something changes, and they begin to desire things that are controversial or unaccepted, or taboo, or illegal or whatever, simply because they&#39;re not supposed to have it.  </p>

<p>To an elite class, for whom the world is their absolute playground, the only remaining &quot;forbidden fruit,&quot; the last thing on earth capable of getting their blood pumping, giving them a feeling of excitement, risk, etc... is going to be scandalous.  </p>

<p>I&#39;m not saying it&#39;s satanic occult ritualistic child-rape and cannibalism, but... I&#39;m not saying it ain&#39;t, either.  </p>

<p>The other theory that seems to be floating around is that members of the elite class of certain industries or areas of life engage in certain acts that are highly scandalous, whether it&#39;s homosexuality in hip-hop (look it up), or satanic stuff and pedophilia in politics, or whatever.  The goal being to lure newcomers into engaging along with them, and then immediately secure photo, video, audio or whatever other kind of proof, with which to blackmail and control them.   </p>

<p>The result becomes a system where every single person has the most unimaginably bad, career-ending, life-destroying dirt on one another and everyone else, and knows the same is true for themselves.  Thus, NOBODY, no individual or group or associate or witness or ANYONE can do anything about it, because everyone would be implicated.  It&#39;s like a perpetual stalemate in the game of blackmail where they all play or they all lose, and it helps to contain the closed off exclusivity of the elite class society.  </p>

<p>Just a couple of theories, I&#39;d love to hear criticisms or alternatives.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I know at least <em>part</em> of the logic behind this is that it keeps certain groups of people in the .01% in line.  In other words, all the people in a certain group who engaged in nefarious financial activity <em>also</em> engage in EXTREMELY, horrifically damning pedophilia activity and tape record it while they&#39;re at it so that if anyone in the group decides to rat out any of the others, the child sex tapes will just get let out, and the people trying to rat out the rest of the group will get immediately imprisoned.  That way the criminality of the evil-going group is kept &quot;in house&quot;.</p>

<p>This, of course, isn&#39;t the only reason why pedophilia is epidemic - there&#39;s also satanic ritual abuse as well - but it&#39;s at least one reason.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I know lots of normal people who love pedophilia art, publicize it on social media, post pictures of children with innuendo comments, who use pedophilia symbols just because, spend 1,000s on pedo art.... No, wait, I don&#39;t know anyone who likes any of that.</p>

<p>OP do you know anyone that is into pedo art???</p>

    <div class="md"><p>But not for something as mala en se as child sex. It&#39;s just wrong. This is a niche fetish. Not many people are into this type of sick thing. </p>

<p>Comparing to taste for food is not a relevant analogy. Everybody eats. Not everybody has sex. Not everybody even likes sex.   </p>

    <div class="md"><p>As I stated, I have already reviewed the evidence, starting when the very first emails dropped. </p>

<p>Re-reviewing the art does not help me or 99.9% of society that do not buy the conspiracy theory connect the dots. </p>

<p>People have very strange taste in art, to each their own. That&#39;s like saying people that watch horror movies are mass murderers. It just doesn&#39;t follow and 99.9% of society agrees.  </p>
