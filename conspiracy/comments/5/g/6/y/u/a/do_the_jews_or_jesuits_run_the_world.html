I simply want someone to show <strong>the LINK</strong> between the two, and keep it straight to the point.  I&#39;ve noticed that one seems to fit the Occam&#39;s razor test, while the other does not.  One explanation seems to be pushed here quite a lot, while the other is kept as secret as possible.  One seems to bring out the same people who push that narrative over and over, and one does not.  One is verboten, and one is just casual conversation.</p>

<p>They are a satanic brotherhood. They don&#39;t discriminate based on race but rather on their allegiance to Satan and ability to channel demonic presence. The Arabs are in, the Chinese are in, the Priests are in, everybody is in.</p>

<p>You&#39;d be surprised how little the elite Jews care about the less entitled members of their race.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s the Jesuits but don&#39;t make the mistake of thinking the Jews are innocent. The Jews did 9/11 via Mossad acting out the Jesuit Oath. The Vatican owns the US, Israel, and London. They use the Jews as bankers and scapegoats on their global chessboard. Go look up and read the Jesuit Oath and you&#39;ll understand everything. They have infiltrated nearly every world power and act as the Palpatine behind all these world events.</p>

<p>They&#39;ve deliberately set the Middle East into eternal conflict by backing both the Muslims and the Jews because they&#39;re able to sell arms/drugs/kids to both parties and export the above internationally. The Zionist Jews you hear so much about trying to take over the Middle East for Israel are nothing more than Jesuit trained Zionists. </p>

<p>The Vatican is the world bank and effectively the end all, be all. They have all the money in the world. Infinite cover up, infinite propaganda, infinite influence. Notice every time a country rejects the world bank the US false flags us and immediately moves in to install &quot;democracy&quot; AKA world bank.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It is bizarre. Where I was raised there were no Jewish people at all, so when I moved to a more diverse area I quickly learned that you can easily offend them. I&#39;m not talking about name calling or anything like that, general conversations must put their opinions first. And if you disagree on any level, you get called anti Semite. I just avoid if at all possible. I don&#39;t want to offend anyone, and it seems my mere existence is offensive to them. I have never experienced anything like it in my life. Why is that? Do they secretly hate themselves and just project it on to others? Do they believe the very things they accuse others of believing? Or are they just generally unhappy and look for a fight wherever they can? IDK.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I see a Ouija Board Effect of disparate groups with sometimes converging agendas.</p>

<p>The narrative of The Jews is itself a partially Jewish narrative. Israel has been responsible for some truly reprehensible hypocrisy and the narrative allows them to play the anit-Semitism card whenever someone mentions persecuting people based on their ethnic identity.</p>

<p>Australia has never had a Jewish Prime Minister but we have had a Jesuit (also several atheists and a Spiritualist). Tony Abbott installed a surveillance state that can see journalists imprisoned and tried to do everything he could to advance the corporate NWO agenda before even his own party decided he was going too far and kicked him out... in favour of someone &quot;more suitable to convincing the public of the need for reform&quot;. </p>

<p>Tony Abbott got into power on the back of Murdoch supplied propaganda. Murdoch is partners with Cheney, Rothschild, and others, in a &quot;newly discovered&quot; oil field in the Golan Heights, territory disputed between Israel and Syria.</p>

<p>While it is presented as such, the narrative of The Jews is not really about all people of the Jewish faith in general. It is specifically about the Rothschild family and their associates who have spent the better part of 200 years funding wars and plundering the wealth of the world. </p>

<p>This chapter discusses the Society of Jesus&#39; acceptance of recruits from Jewish origin or the so-called conversos prior to 1593. This tolerance ended at the Fifth General Congregation in 1593 due to the combined efforts of the Spanish Crown and the majority of Spanish Jesuits themselves. It reveals that several studies have found that the Society&#39;s founder and its first Superior General Ignatius Loyola came from a converso family and that he had wished he had been Jewish to have the honor of being from the same race as Jesus and the Virgin Mary.</p>

<p>Q. Why was the Jesuit order so inclusive in its early days?</p>

<p>A. Ignatius of Loyola, the Basque who founded the Jesuit order in 1539, was joined by men who came largely from Iberia. It was a liberal order for the first three decades. Loyola was very open to accept candidates of Jewish ancestry into the order. He made sure there was no discrimination among candidates. One of the founding fathers was a converso. The Society of Jesus was substantially influenced by Christians of Jewish ancestry.</p>

<p>The jesuits didn&#39;t ban jews until they were investigated by the church. They were harsher in their blood purity laws to throw off the scent. Oh and jews were also in charge of the document vetting process. Conveniently that allowed them to deny low social and economic standing jews while admitting wealthy powerful crypto jews. </p>

<p>But by all means go ahead and keep believing you&#39;ve got it all figured out. There&#39;s absolutely no way you missed any pertinent information. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>First of all, Loyola was intimately advised and funded by Francis Borgia, of Papal nobility, who became the third Superior General of the Jesuits. Borgia was the real master of Loyola and the early Jesuit Order. With that said, it does not in any way matter of what race Loyola was; the implications of Loyola&#39;s racial decent amount to nothing and this fallacious argumentation is only used by neo-Nazis attempting to irrationally reconcile how the Jesuits are apparently behind so many leaders and world events. The fact of the matter is that all Jesuits take a vow to defend the Pope and uphold his temporal and spiritual power. Chinese Jesuits, Irish Jesuits, Indian Jesuits, Jesuits of all races take this oath and are therefore totally subservient to the pope. Besides, Loyola was not a Jew in either racial or religious respects as will be shown.</p>

<p>Loyola was a Basque, not a Jew. The Basques are a RACE of people. Loyola is described by anthropologists as having typified Basque ethnoracial characteristics:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The founders of Jesuitism, Loyola Xavier and others, were Basques, and Basques are still among the best and most fervent missionaries of the Roman Catholic Church. <strong>Loyola, even in physiognomy and physique, was a typical Basque, and preserved his Basque habits until his death</strong>. </p>

</ul>

<p>You quoted yourself that Loyola said he <em>wished he were</em> Jewish! So don&#39;t tell me he was a Jew! He was ethnically and racially a Basque and religiously a Catholic mystic. The Alumbrados - of which Loyola was a member before starting the Jesuits - was not Jewish, it was based on Catholic mysticism of Meister Eckhart; see chapter 14 of <em>Christian Spirituality: God&#39;s Presence Through the Ages</em> by professor Richard J. Woods. This is the same mysticism which the Jesuits inherited through Loyola&#39;s <em>Spiritual Exercises</em>. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Q. Why was the Jesuit order so inclusive in its early days?</p>

<p>A. Ignatius of Loyola, the Basque who founded the Jesuit order in 1539, was joined by men who came largely from Iberia. It was a liberal order for the first three decades. Loyola was very open to accept candidates of Jewish ancestry into the order. He made sure there was no discrimination among candidates. One of the founding fathers was a converso. The Society of Jesus was substantially influenced by Christians of Jewish ancestry.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If you believe this bears any sort of relevance on the last four centuries, then read about what the Jesuits wrote about the Jews in their <em>La Civilita Cattolica</em>; that Jesuit magazine essentially defined the blueprint for 20th century European antisemitism and pro-holocaust propaganda. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>The jesuits didn&#39;t ban jews until they were investigated by the church. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Not so, the Jesuits themselves were against Jews within the order. As Robert A. Maryks, an author specializing on the early Jesuit Order who is so often ironically quoted by antisemites writes:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The converso character of the memorialistas movement was, nevertheless, accentuated by the anti-converso lobby, which after the election of Acquaviva (1581) included other high-ranking officials in the Jesuit curia, such as Paul Hoffaeus, Manuel Rodrigues, and Lorenzo Maggio. Their decade-long intense discriminatory campaign led to a punitive decree issued by GC 5 (1593), known as Decree de genere. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Oh ande jews wre also in charge of the document vetting process. Conveniently that allowed them to deny low social and economic standing jews while admitting wealthy powerful crypto jews.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Again, how is this pertinent to TOADY? Or the last FOUR CENTURIES, when, for the majority of the time Jews were not only banned by the Jesuits, but were the victims of rabid persecution and discrimination by the Jesuits? There is nothing anyone can refute about the absolutely real power of the Jesuit Order in full control of the Roman Papacy, so for this reason, antisemites resort to just saying Loyola was a Jew in a humorous last-ditch effort.</p>

<p>You quoted their text saying that Loyola wished he were a Jew! Did you even read it?</p>

<blockquote>

<p>That not an argument.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It isn&#39;t &quot;the jews&quot; it&#39;s some of them and they&#39;re obviously controlling things.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Nearly all Jews in places of power are subject to the Roman Papacy. They were called court Jews in the middle ages and afterwards, and Rothschild was one of them.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The jesuits haven&#39;t been around long enough to be responsible for the millennia long reputation Jews are saddled with. Jewish leaders have.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The Roman Empire then to become the Roman Papacy have existed for  millennia. They have had the most influence throughout history. This is irrefutable and common knowledge. Jews on the other hand have been subjects of intense persecution and did not even have their own nation until the 1940s. </p>

<p>You&#39;ve already conceded by not attempting to counter the prior comment. </p>
