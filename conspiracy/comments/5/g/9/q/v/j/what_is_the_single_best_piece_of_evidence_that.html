<p>Maybe those particular planes weren&#39;t equipped with them but they definitely had air phones on many models of airplanes at the time. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is not the &quot;single best piece of evidence&quot; by a long shot, but it always cracks me up it&#39;s so ridiculous so I have to throw it in here. You have to watch it if you haven&#39;t seen it before.... </p>

<p>This guy Mark Walsh (of course all the initial eyewitnesses are media employees) comes out of nowhere while everyone is still scratching their heads and/or running in fear with no idea what has just happened and excitedly spits out what will become the official 9/11 Commission Report explanation for why the buildings collapsed. It&#39;s totally unbelievable.  Pretty funny.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There&#39;s three pieces of evidence I see as &quot;proof&quot;</p>

<ol>
<li><p>WTC 7 reaching free fall speed during its fall, which is a physical impossibility for a building collapsing on itself.</p></li>
<li><p>Nanothermite found in the wreckage without any explanation.</p></li>
<li><p>The proof of steel that not only melted, but actually evaporated and left behind a Swiss cheese pattern in one known case. The wreckage was red hot for weeks after the collapsed.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Obviously there is a ton more evidence, but those are the strongest points.</p>

<p>When they cut his internet they probably just left him with a landline phone. There were some big leaks in the passed few weeks.</p>

<p>They want us wasting our energy looking for our hero instead of researching the clinton foundation and watching the recounts. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I love how this got buried. I mean there is so much to what happened that day and the weeks and months after but this one has always bothered me a lot. &quot;No, no, just look the other way. We aren&#39;t concerned about this bit of the puzzle.&quot;</p>

<p>I find it amazing that the IRS can find me anywhere. You know those little reports you get in the mail every year that tell you your earnings, expected retirement benefits and everything else? I have fucking moved to places without my name on anything, haven&#39;t filed a change of address form or anything else and somehow those reports still find their way to my mailbox. I recognize that they are probably getting the info from my employer so it&#39;s not that magical but my point is there are paper trails on everyone everywhere. </p>

<p>And you are telling me you can&#39;t figure out (<em>or disclose - because someone knows</em>) who was behind all the shady trading before everything happened? Who is this? Dr. X hiding out at his volcano island fortress? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Never needed evidence from the mainstream media to convince me. I was on the phone with an engineer when the second tower collapsed. </p>

<p>After the second plane plowed into the second tower, I decided to call in to work to let my boss, the above mentioned engineer, know that I was going to be late. I had the TV on, he did not have one in the office and wasn&#39;t aware that the second bldg had been hit. So, I called in and was telling him that yes, a second plane had hit the other bldg... when bldg fell straight down into its own footprint. As I described what I was seeing to him he said this: &quot;That is impossible. That can&#39;t happen. There is no way that a plane could have done that. That is physically impossible - what is going on?&quot; </p>

<p>I remember the chill that came over me when hearing his denial. I was at the time 7 and a half months pregnant, and it was surreal enough watching 9/11 play out right there on TV live, but then to have him tell me that what I was seeing and hearing was not possible...well, I had to wonder what kind of world I was bringing my first child into. She&#39;s 15 now, and I still wonder.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>IMO, the freefall. Dimitri Khazelov has a good theory about it. Stolen Russian suitcase-nukes (as in, they performed inventory and were missing a bunch of them) detonated underground conveniently explain a huge chunk of the mysteries around 9/11, such as:</p>

<ul>
<li>Massive heat remnants measured even in December</li>
<li>Cycling of emergency personnel when they hit a certain level on their dosimeters</li>
<li>Freefall</li>
<li>Explosions heard by witnesses</li>
<li>Long-term symptoms felt by firemen etc., matching radiation sickness. Lots of lung cancer cases.</li>
<li>Building 7&#39;s corner being caught by part of the second nuke&#39;s radius</li>

    <div class="md"><p>One thing I want to know is what happened to the people on the actual planes.</p>

<p>What I mean is if the Pentagon was hit with a missile instead of an actual plane where did the people on that real flight go? Were they just killed? Did they fly the plane out somewhere over the ocean and blow it up? </p>

<p>I&#39;m not sure I believe the Pentagon was hit with a plane. It doesn&#39;t make sense. If it was that is a pretty random plane that makes small and delicate holes without breaking windows or leaving much in the way of plane debris. </p>

<p>We are talking about one of the most heavily guarded buildings in the world. You know there is probably a camera every five feet monitoring every inch of space on the property and the best they can do is release one shitty stop frame video that doesn&#39;t even look at all credible?</p>

<p>So again, where are the people and the actual plane that supposedly hit the Pentagon?</p>
