        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Does anybody follow this guy?  I literally just started seeing his videos pop up on youtube.  I find him fascinating and I enjoy listening to him talk.  He&#39;s a very good speaker and presenter, and has good imagery and examples for while he speaks.  But I kind of feel like he is a nutjob haha, i&#39;m not sure why.  I would like to see more of his resources for myself.  He talks so fast and so persuasively, it is easy to get wrapped up and I feel like I need to take a step back and not take it all without vetting</p>

<p>Does anybody on here know more about him, or have an opinion to render on him?</p>

He has been branded by many as a nut job but some of those same people might now be rethinking a portion of their opinions based on the information David Icke put out long ago about the &quot;elites&quot; and their pedophile activities and worse....</p>

<p>Very interesting subjects and oh so pertinent in these days.</p>

<p>I feel like some stuff might be way out there but I keep it in mind.</p>

<p>I think with him and other &quot;conspiracy theorists&quot; is that you need to split the message and the content and judge each one individually.</p>

<p>I&#39;m personally around 5h30m in and I started 2 weeks ago lol</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I do enjoy his work but I don&#39;t think I could sit through 8+hours of him. My sibling has been to see him a couple of times and finds him informative. They&#39;re not as far down the rabbit hole as I am when it comes to conspiracies. I feel sometimes like Ickes whole &quot;Reptilian Elites&quot; spiel is just there so the people will dismiss him as a whack job and laugh at him, thereby ignoring some of the other revelations he makes. </p>

<p>Probably really bad grammar in this, I apologise. I am currently in a fog of cold remedies :( </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree - the thing that confuses me is that he is clearly a very intelligent man.  Did he sit down and weigh the &#39;reptile&#39; thing as &quot;well, this will attract more attention than it would turn away.&quot; or, does it have some truth to it?   I just can&#39;t see why a man with his intelligence would say something totally ridiculous with no reasoning to it and not realizing it would deter a LOT of people - why say it, if there was no truth to it whatsoever or unless he KNEW the benefit of the lie would outweigh the consequence?

    <div class="md"><p>Well- his point was that the original people who mated with this predominant reptilian specimen, creating a sort of half-breed, continued to interbreed with themselves, creating a royal bloodline that contained the original traits of this reptilian specimen- and one of the traits he claims that they have is a lack of empathy.  This allows them dominate the environment and inflict horrors on others and feel no consequence, while the rest of us out-bred those genes.  It makes perfect sense.  But the problem is, theres no way to really prove that point, even if our brains contain original aspects of this anatomy, or whatever.  Unless we bash their heads open and see for ourselves</p>
