<p>He actually says discussion needs to be based on evidence or shouldnt be allowed, on a sub which is in itself a conspiracy theory!!  I mean, the official line is that JA is in the embassy and fine, so a sub named &quot;where is he?&quot; is already questioning the narrative - without any evidence!! Does any else see the irony here?</p>

<p>I wish he would just be honest and say &quot;we must control the narrative because we have been taken over, just like Wikileaks was&quot;.  At least thats the truth.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>With this obvious Wikileaks trolling style since Assange &quot;left&quot;, I would say it was russian who operated this, but I didn&#39;t say US gov / obama admin is not concerned neither, I would say they just let their russian pals do the &quot;dirty job&quot;, but I could be plain wrong and it could be the chinese, who knows lol. Actualy like anybody else I don&#39;t know lol. But the fact Julian Assange is missing / &quot;like dead&quot; and not in jail or custody plus the fact Wikileaks members/actvists seems all silenced a way they dont even speak about it (lol) etc etc plus the fact emabassy international laws /rules might have been breached to capture Assange make me think its rather the russians doing this shit and not CIA / US gov (except maybe the internet outage/dead man switch &quot;disabled&quot;, once again I dunno).
Wikileaks could have received any compromising infos from any sources in the world and not only US gov has stuffs to hide. Think about it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t know ... maybe Assange &quot;planned&quot; (or was told) to release some middly interesting  /compromising stuff about HRC with the emails so called &quot;scandal&quot; in a first &quot;batch&quot; and then (secretly ?) planned  go to the &quot;next level&quot; and release some more serious shit about trump  / trump-russian ties / whatever / etc (This what I would have done if I was Assange lol) during a second batch that never happened. Personaly I think he was somehow  &quot;encouraged&quot; to release some shit about HRC. Suppressing Assange after he started to release the HRC emails but before he released some more things related to the other &quot;group&quot; was somehow 100% benefit / &quot;perfect timing&quot; for the &quot;criminals&quot;. <strong>Note</strong> : These are only my assumptions.</p>

Maybe you should consider that you are making conclusions without much actual understanding? It&#39;s always important to have more questions than assumptions.

<blockquote>
<p>Some of you may ask, &quot;Why not just moderate it?&quot; Well, every time we try, it results in threads on <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> (and here) about how we&#39;re &quot;compromised&quot; (could die happy if I never see that word again). </p>

    <div class="md"><p>My &quot;issues&quot;? My issue is that the only moderation happening is boldfaced censorship on that sub, period. Same exact pattern as happened on dncleaks n wikileaks, which everyone here knows.  All Im looking for is to point out that discussion of actually <strong>relevant and likely</strong> theories is quickly and viciously buried and the authors silenced/banned.   Im not the only one.  As one of the other critics said - if u can dig up the of course buried threads - the public mod logs are useless, they wouldnt show the heavy handed gestapo tactics being employed.  My big  crime was to post photos of the vans that i believe drove JA away....Oh the horror! That deserves 80 immediate downvotes and 30 comments from 1 month old accounts saying its &quot;shitty evidence&quot; (all of which upvote each other, how convenient), but lets all get back to ponderung the hidden meaning and message in embassy cats tweets. How freaking obvious and ridiculous.  And then, icing on the cake, since I wont shut up at exactly how obvious and ridiculous, im banned.  Well you losers cant ban me here can ya? Like i said,  im not the first user to have to do this.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>hey man, I was just asking you questions. There is no need to attack me personally. I was only asking for some more information, to try to understand your grievances. </p>

<p>You said your big crime was to post photos of the van, but anyone who looks at your user profile can see that you posted a number of low quality posts with shitty headlines? (<a href="http://archive.is/JCJyZ">http://archive.is/JCJyZ</a>, <a href="http://archive.is/4ltZe">http://archive.is/4ltZe</a>, <a href="http://archive.is/e4Paw">http://archive.is/e4Paw</a>)</p>

<p>Then you tried to post there about how the subreddit was compromised (<a href="http://archive.is/aiIY2">http://archive.is/aiIY2</a>), just like r/wikileaks and r/conspiracy, and how people should go to r/whereisjulian instead. Now in this very post title you say THAT sub has you shadowbanned. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t moderate any communities on reddit, but if I did I&#39;d probably also ban you for that kind of behavior. Have you considered that the only common factor here is you?</p>

<p>I saw your post on r/conspiracy, then looked at your comment history where even the &#39;removed&#39; posts are visible to try and get an idea of what the situation was. I asked questions and you immediately got defensive. The &#39;behavior [you&#39;re] referencing&#39; is me trying to have a conversation with you, but it&#39;s fine because we&#39;re clearly not making any sort of progress. I won&#39;t reply after this comment (really).</p>

<p>How am I attacking you personally? I am asking you to clarify statements you have made here and in other places, as seen on your own user page. You got really prickly when I did so, which to me suggests that you don&#39;t really want your claims questioned. Not a great impression. The &#39;quality&#39; statement was not about one post but instead the contributions it looked like you had made to that subreddit. I provided links. You are either intentionally muddying the water or need to read it again.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t really know what that means. I don&#39;t care if it&#39;s you, 100 people, or even a million saying something, I will ask probing questions and try to understand as best I can. If your claims don&#39;t stand up to scrutiny, I think you should try to hone your argument, not attack the person asking questions. Again, I won&#39;t reply after this, because it&#39;s clear that we&#39;re talking past each other, but I want to leave this exchange up for people to make their own conclusions about how we&#39;ve both acted.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;not going to reply&quot; Wow, to what do we owe the pleasure of your previous comments? How lucky! thank you for coming down here to reply at all, m&#39;lord. </p>

<p>Even your examples of his &quot; low quality posts &quot; are bad examples. Let&#39;s look at them now:</p>

<p>1.<strong>He&#39;s correct: October 18:</strong> Witnesses photo and report a convoy of military/police and a SERCO (the same company prison van responsible for &quot;escorting&quot; julian assange into the embassy originally) van that rolled on the embassy. (  prison van convoy: <a href="https://i.4cdn.org/pol/1480657034570.jpg">https://i.4cdn.org/pol/1480657034570.jpg</a> ) </p>

<p>2.<strong>He&#39;s correct</strong> to ask what&#39;s going on with that (now dogshit) sub. Immediately following Assange&#39;s extraordinary rendition, on Oct. 20,  <a href="/r/wikileaks">/r/wikileaks</a>, <a href="/r/dncleaks">/r/dncleaks</a>, <a href="/r/wikileakstaskforce">/r/wikileakstaskforce</a> add 21 new moderators and remove previous mods, all threads about Assange going missing deleted since. Wikileaks twitter, after having no ( Z E R O ) typos in their 10+year history, has 5 typos in a two day period. The letters missed or added erroneously can be reordered to &quot; HELP HIM &quot;. </p>

<p>3.<strong>He&#39;s correct</strong> to ask how, when, and why posts require approval now. He didn&#39;t do so in a manor that you approve of and so therefor it&#39;s low-quality content? Or do you just not like the question he was asking? I&#39;m not going to describe why, and I&#39;m not going to patronize you in a passive-aggressive manor like you did to OP here. Your attempts to take what you apparently consider an academic high ground over the other user are transparent.</p>

<p>4.<strong>He&#39;s correct</strong> to post regarding the fact that those subs now have a very controlled output. Reddit is volatile, anyone who wishes to suppress an important message can and will do so, because it&#39;s worth it. The right sub could gain popularity very quickly. Best to nip it in the bud while it&#39;s still possible. Before it turns into a pizzagate for example.</p>

<p>Stop being such a cunt, honestly. If you&#39;re hired to perpetuate the nonsense, that&#39;s one thing. But if you&#39;re a real person, feel free to not believe it and move on. The fact remains that there&#39;s more circumstantial evidence for his extraordinary rendition than there is for his being alive right now. That says a lot. And if you think his extraordinary rendition is beyond the reaches of the CIA you&#39;re delusional. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>your account is a month old.  </p>

<p>Please be serious.</p>

<p>If you truly are that new to Reddit, then you realy have no business being so forensic in examining and critiquing my post histories and patterns.  OR, you are a repeat experienced Redditor, which would conveniently not allow me to do the same analysis on your posting histories.  Which is it?  Never mind, I dont care.  </p>

<p>Even though you tried to make it about me and my personal posting, that isnt what this should be about.  It should be about how we are having a discussion here on a separate sub because both (actually all 3 ) of the subs that this stuff <strong>should</strong> be discussed on are so heavily controlled and censored by an obvious behind-the-scenes (and I think organized) groupthink that it is impossible.  That is not only <strong>my</strong> observation, but that of others, so readers who <strong>see</strong> this are aware.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Been tried several times and even live video recorded, they say all inquiries need to be made to &lt;contact info&gt; and they refuse to give any information.</p>

<p>If you look at the timeline stickied on <a href="/r/whereIsAssange">/r/whereIsAssange</a>. And try to step back and look from a birds eye view at events around the week 10/15-10/21 to me its plain what happened.  JA was taken into custody on a USA &quot;national security / election meddling&quot; pretext.  And I dont complain or care if people draw a different conclusion, but to have such massive coordinated discrediting and personal attacks disgusts me and I wont just take it without calling it out. Like I said, several others aaid the exact same, is it a group delusion?</p>

<p>Just because the official line is that JA is in the embassy, it doesn&#39;t mean that evidence can&#39;t exist that suggests otherwise.</p>
