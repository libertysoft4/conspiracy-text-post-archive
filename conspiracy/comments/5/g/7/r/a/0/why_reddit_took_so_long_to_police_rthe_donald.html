        <p><span class="badge badge-primary">120</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;2016-12-03 by <a class="author" href="../../../../../../../../user/Flytape.html">Flytape</a></p>
        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>So there is a pretty significant overlap between <a href="/r/the_donald">/r/the_donald</a> and <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> as many of you have noticed (the users not the mods).  Some of you aren&#39;t happy about it, others are pretty pleased... This post isn&#39;t about taking sides.</p>

<p>Full disclosure, I have frequented the_donald this election season because I support Trump.  I supported Trump where usually I vote libertarian because the potential for another Clinton or Bush administration really freaked me out from the moment that Jeb &quot;please clap&quot; Bush announced.</p>

<p>Anyways... What many of you might not know is that Reddit has allowed subs with far worse dispositions than <a href="/r/the_donald">/r/the_donald</a> exist for years.  The_donald is often immature and occasionally spawned some brigades towards <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a> but being immature isn&#39;t against the ToS and subs like <a href="/r/subredditdrama">/r/subredditdrama</a> have been spawning brigades on a daily basis which are far more destructive than anything the_donald has done.</p>

<p>If you&#39;ve ever watched what happens when <a href="/r/subredditdrama">/r/subredditdrama</a> links to a sub, the effects ruin the community for a day or more.  I was once username mentioned in subredditdrama over 30 times in a span of a few hours, I mention this because Reddit has claimed that the username mentioning of <a href="/u/spez">/u/spez</a> is harassment.  Well when it was happening to me, frequently and in great volume, the admins told me to block people...  As if that&#39;s a good solution when it&#39;s 500 different people doing it.  And poor spez was being called a Cuck, well I was being called a nazi and was powerless to defend myself because I was banned from the subs spreading the lies, layers and layers of lies which quoted me out of context, misquoted me and at one point Joshua Goldberg even pretended to be a neo-nazi and started authoring neo-nazi articles on the daily stormer where he &quot;confirmed&quot; that I was some sort of white nationalist (I&#39;m not and I never have been).</p>

<p>Long story short, the harassment directed towards me far exceeded any harassment that <a href="/u/spez">/u/spez</a> received in every measure except for the quantity that the_donald was able to produce.  But Reddit did not care.</p>

<p>Many of you are familiar with subs that aim to harass <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>, but did you know that the same people who founded and operated <a href="/r/conspiratard">/r/conspiratard</a> were the same people who founded and operated <a href="/r/the_donald">/r/the_donald</a>?  </p>

<p>When the_donald came about there was a social fracture among the clique that was primarily responsible for most of the subs on Reddit with the MO (modus operandi) of targeting and harassing those who they are opposed to.</p>

<p>What had begun to take shape was reddit&#39;s attack dogs, their network of power mods like bipolarbear0, JCM, NYPD32 were beginning to split along left/right political lines as the presidential race heated up.  JCM and NYPD32 to name a few went right as tokkul and others went left.  But the attack dog culture, the harassment based sub idea was now firmly planted within the_donald and was squarely aimed at Reddit&#39;s favorite demographic... The liberal white male.  And they branded the liberal white male &quot;cucks&quot;.</p>

<p>It&#39;s rinse wash repeat folks.  Conspiratards, cucks, nut jobs, nazis, etc etc.  They call you a name, they provide fake evidence that you fit their branding and they harass the fuck out of you.</p>

<p>The real question is why does Reddit care now?  And the answer is obvious, they care now because a handful of their attack dogs got loose and turned against them.   The Reddit culture is a left wing version of the_donald and the_donald is just a right wing rebranding of the same shit.  </p>

<p>Reddit is perfectly okay with you being harassed if you&#39;re a conspiracy theorist, a libertarian, a conservative, a Christian or anything that isn&#39;t in alignment with their California liberal ideological base.  They will sit back and ignore your complaints, they will pretend like your community &quot;isn&#39;t really being brigaded&quot; while we have seen modtalk leaks from IRC and now discord chats where the admins are clearly a part of the cliques.</p>

<p>The same people in the recent discord leaks were the same ones in the old modtalk leaks still doing the same shit, still plotting to ruin Reddit communities of their perceived opposition.  </p>

<p>The_donald is reddit&#39;s own monster coming home to roost.  They didn&#39;t literally create the_donald using super secret alt accounts or anything spectacular like that.  But the people who did create the_donald learned how to skirt the rules of Reddit by running all these other harassment subs.</p>

<p><a href="/r/conspiratard">/r/conspiratard</a></p>

<p><a href="/r/topmindsofreddit">/r/topmindsofreddit</a></p>

<p><a href="/r/badhistory">/r/badhistory</a></p>

<p><a href="/r/subredditdrama">/r/subredditdrama</a></p>

<p><a href="/r/shitredditsays">/r/shitredditsays</a></p>

<p>All these harassment subs have done far more extensive harassment than the_donald, all of them have overlapping mod teams. At least they overlapped before the_donald was born.  But the_donald is being singled out because they jumped the script, Reddit doesn&#39;t have control over this particular group of harassers so now they are going to do something about it.</p>

<p>Meanwhile topmindsofreddit and conspiratard are free to keep brigading other communities and harassing users all they want.  Subredditdrama is free to lay waste to any small community unfortunate enough to be the subject of their judgement and shitredditsays is free to doxx people and get them fired like VA.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong></p>

<p>It was brought to my attention that <a href="/r/conspiratard">/r/conspiratard</a> no longer allows people to use their sub as a base to crosspost and brigade other subs.  It is believed that they did this on their own and the admins never forced them to do it.</p>

<p>however, my point still stands because the people who used <a href="/r/conspiratard">/r/conspiratard</a> to brigade simply created <a href="/r/topmindsofreddit">/r/topmindsofreddit</a> and/or <a href="/r/ihateconspiracyclub">/r/ihateconspiracyclub</a> to continue the brigades.  <a href="/r/subredditdrama">/r/subredditdrama</a>, which has by far been the worst in terms of brigades, still has free reign to disrupt communities in which they are not welcome.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>exactly.</p>

<p>Reddit has totally gone to shit the last few weeks since the election.</p>

<p>I really feel like whoever/whatever influenced the subs <a href="/r/DNCleaks">/r/DNCleaks</a> and <a href="/r/Wikileaks">/r/Wikileaks</a> went whackamole and also took over <a href="/r/WhereIsAssange">/r/WhereIsAssange</a> . To me this is obvious and horrifying.</p>

<p>Similarly, the Donald has itself been, tough to put a finger on it, &quot;muted&quot; for the last couple weeks IMO. I dont think the user base (myself included) has been less active or less vocal, but many people have noticed many irregularities re T_D threads being seen by the larger Reddit community - I really think there is major fuckery going on behind the scenes.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well the admins required that the_donald no longer link to <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a>... This was in response to them frequently linking there and disrupting a community that didn&#39;t want them there.   The_donald most definitely is a political sub, and on the surface there is no reason to disallow them to use <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a>.  But the admins didn&#39;t want them organizing their involvement there and thus stopped them from linking there.</p>

<p><a href="/r/Conspiratard">/r/Conspiratard</a> is definitely a conspiracy related sub, but it doesn&#39;t mesh with <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> and we have repeatedly asked the admins to disallow them to link/brigade <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> and they apparently don&#39;t care if our community it disrupted by ideologically opposed outsiders. <strong>(Edit topmindsofreddit is the current brigade happy sub, conspiratard no longer allows linking to us)</strong></p>

<p>The pattern is clear!  The admins want to shelter their liberal spaces while allowing a wild west environment to persist in any right wing spaces.</p>

<p>Same with the admins requiring the_donald to not allow username mentioning, they are happy to allow their liberal spaces to username harass people, but they shelter their own from the same abuse.</p>

<p>It&#39;s much worse than just pro-trump material, they are allowed to run hate subs and promote ridicule of conspiracists because a free flow of information exposing the misdeeds of the rich and powerful is something the people at the very top of reddit, above the admins, can&#39;t allow.  </p>

<p>As far as I know, their harassment was mainly limited to light brigading and cuckspam. Which is why they haven&#39;t gone the way of pizzagate. The sticky abuse was why their stickies don&#39;t make it to r/all anymore. Which I&#39;m honestly glad about, I didn&#39;t know that stickies got such a boost for making it to the front page.

<p>I said light harassment, as in not worthy of censure. The_Donald&#39;s problem was that because of the sticky spam they were very visible. That&#39;s also why fatpeoplehate went under. The only sub that had anywhere near that visibility (on OPs list) was SRS, and that was more because it was mentioned so much, rather than hitting the front page all the time.

<p>For the past 3 years now the front page has been dominated with various &quot;sjw&quot; and minority scare stories. If reddit was so liberal that would not occur. What type of leftist loves to hate social justice so much? it does not make sense.</p>

Yes NYPD and JCM were the mods of /conspiratard and stuff but specifically NYPD I felt had his heart in it. I believe NYPD was/is actually autistic and spent all day working on the_donald. Yes they might have made it as a joke but it ended up becoming real. The &#39;balls&#39; of the subreddit likely came from the balls of the Trump campaign, and I fully believe that Trump&#39;s old manager Corey Lewendowski had a hand in <a href="/r/the_donald">/r/the_donald</a> . That ciswhite guy blew the subreddit the fuck up within weeks and as soon as Corey was fired, ciswhite was too.

</blockquote>

<p>Opinions are like assholes, everybody has one.   The true distinction between individuals and mindless autobots is having the self awareness to realize that silencing someone else&#39;s unfavorable opinion, through whatever means, can and will be turned around on you at some point.</p>

<p>It&#39;s &quot;the means&quot; that are important, in the case I&#39;m outlining in the post the means being used is hivemind bullying tactics.  It doesn&#39;t matter if it&#39;s a real hivemind like the dominant Reddit &quot;California liberal&quot; hivemind, the_donald hivemind or even if it&#39;s a fake hivemind like topmindsofreddit where each of a handful of real people use a multitude of sock puppets to push the overton window or consensus crack on a specific topic.</p>

<p>What matters is that it has been perfectly acceptable to Reddit, until it is no longer in alignment with their overarching agenda.  </p>

<p>Your opinion about my deeds here in <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> are irrelevant, just like my opinion that you&#39;re grossly misinformed about me is irrelevant.  This post is about why Reddit was torn between action and inaction in the case of the_donald.  And the answer is that action sets a precedence, and their previous inaction in the case of SRD, SRS, conspiratard etc etc is the context.</p>

<p>Thanks for your thoughts.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What a persecution complex you have.  Mr I have been removed as mod and put back multiple times do to your actions.  The same guy who caused a mass exodus from conspiracy due to a moronic video blog attempt.  You may be able to impress some dumb kids, but us longtimers know.exactly who you are and what you represent.  The major problem of reddit, idiot mods who think they speak for their whole subs they mod and spend entirely too much of their life on a website dedicated to entertainment w no pay.  Basically, losers with too much free time trying to grab a little power in their pathetic lives.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There was never a mass exodus.</p>

<p>Look man, I really don&#39;t care about your opinion.  If I worried myself every time someone had a harsh opinion about what I&#39;ve done or what people are talking about on <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> then this sub would just like every other watered down safe space on Reddit.  For that reason you&#39;ll have to forgive me for not giving a shit about you and your dig on a personal level.  While you may be a great user here who contributes to quality discussions with impeccable decorum (I don&#39;t know I haven&#39;t looked into you) you aren&#39;t displaying any of that here so I really don&#39;t care.  I embrace your negative labels as a sign that I&#39;m doing the right thing and I embrace the butthurt you&#39;ve been leaking.  By embracing all the worst things you can do to me, you have no power of me or my duties to this community.</p>

<p>The liberation of the individual from the clutches of the hivemind ensures a diversity of thought, and that diversity is more important than your angsty rebuke of my presence.</p>

<p>Kind regards,</p>

<p>Flytape</p>

You ruined your credibility a long time ago, but some might not remember.

    <div class="md"><p>I actually recused myself of moderating any presidential political posts because of my support for Trump and patronage of the_donald.  I announced this to the other mods of conspiracy, so you&#39;re exactly wrong about me again.  Big shocker there right?</p>

<p>It&#39;s obvious that you have impossible standards to satisfy so why not start your own sub where you are 100% in charge and see how it goes? Make it better than conspiracy and then your impossible standards can be actualized instead of thrown around at the mods of conspiracy like monkeys throw poop at each other.</p>

<p>You have no idea how impotent your criticisms of me are.</p>

<p>Why do we have public mod logs? Because I pushed for it.</p>

<p>If my credibility is ruined, that&#39;s a personal experience for you and a handful of others.  You can look at the comments here in this very post and see that you&#39;re in a minority on this subject.  And again I must stress that I&#39;ve learned not to give a shit about people like you, the haters.  So while you&#39;re impotently flailing around like a child who doesn&#39;t understand why his parents have established rules, I&#39;m just going to keep on doing my thing man!</p>

<p>Have a fabulous fucking awesome day!</p>
