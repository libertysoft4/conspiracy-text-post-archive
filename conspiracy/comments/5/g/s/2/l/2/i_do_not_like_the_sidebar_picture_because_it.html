        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>There have been numerous questionable sidebar pictures for this subreddit, and I&#39;m wondering if it&#39;s intentional by a moderator trying to bring this sub down. </p>

<p>Seriously, if you knew nothing about this sub and came here and saw that image first, you&#39;d see that and think it means &quot;Jews are the devil and own the media&quot; or something to that effect. Which is an impression that only serves to empower those few who are <em>actually</em> in charge. </p>

<p>Jews do not run the system, Rothschild Zionists do, and by conflating the two, you are doing exactly what the Rothschild Zionists want. They want to play the victim and be safe from criticism, which they can only do if they associate themselves with the Jewish population at large. The Jewish population and its history is a shield they hide behind. That way any blame goes to the Jews, instead of the real Rothschild Zionist owners. Just like in WW2. The real owners get away unharmed because most people are too fixated on these simple &quot;battles&quot; they can observe in their daily lives, real low-level common denominator stuff, which is mostly divided by racial, geographical, religious, or political lines. The powerful stir up these tensions using the media apparatus, and the conflict becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy. While the real people running the show remain out of the spotlight.</p>

<p>Pictures like the sidebar, and the endless anti-jew rhetoric seen on many conspiracy theory websites, only serves to confuse the issue. It&#39;s the 99.9% vs the 0.01%, being divided among lines other than those of power, only acts to divide and conquer the non-powerful populations, <strong>which in turn keeps TPTB in power!</strong> </p>

<p>If the idea of searching for real conspiracies is being taken at all seriously here, then change the sidebar picture, please. </p>

<p>You can condense it down a lot, too, for the &quot;blue pill&quot; sorts. </p>

<p>If anything that isn&#39;t establishment is considered fringe, and then popular online communities funnel all the &#39;fringe&#39; content into isolated spots by eliminating spots for people who are racist or have other specific interests, then by default it all gets mixed into the same community, which makes it easy to discredit everything that is &#39;fringe&#39; in one fell swoop. </p>

I could believe they are peers, since there is a Jesuit pope controlling the catholic church, but I think the Rothschild family&#39;s central banking control is more powerful than the religious control of the Jesuits, as powerful as it may be.

    <div class="md"><p>The fact there was a terrorist thing right outside comet pizza and the media won&#39;t shut up about it is pretty damning, considering the timing. Also the extremely uniform &quot;fake news&quot; thing that came out right when pizzagate did. There&#39;s so many circumstantial things, like the podesta wikileaks coded language emails, and the giant basement, and the 3 restaurants with known pedo logos all right next to each other, and the comet pizza owner being named #49 most powerful in GQ... lots of circumstantial stuff. Especially if you connect it to Epstein and the Lolita Express, and Bill Clinton. Enough to warrant an investigation, that&#39;s for sure. </p>

<p>But of course the three letter agencies are in on it, and use the pedo stuff as blackmail, so they&#39;re trying to keep the public from finding out or else they lose that blackmail power over those high-level elected politicians. If it does come out in an official way and there is an investigation and some people go down, it&#39;s going to be very surgical and only certain specific people will get thrown under the bus. Seems like Podesta and maybe a few others, but then the Clintons and many others who participated will walk away and the media will exclusively blame it on podesta. I think that&#39;s how they&#39;ll do damage control. </p>

<p>But seeing as this seems to be international, and several very high-level rings have been broken up and the those people arrested, in other countries. I think they&#39;ll use this as a way to globally &quot;trim the fat&quot; and get rid of high-level political people they don&#39;t like. After all, they never let a disaster go to waste. But the real power structure will remain intact and generally untouched, unless most people move beyond the narratives provided by the media, which is owned by that very power structure and thus will never betray it. </p>

<p>What do you think?</p>

<p>Haven&#39;t heard that one. Got a good source? I&#39;d like to know more about that. I tried googling but I just got CNN garbage and unrelated stuff, may have to try another search engine for this one... </p>

<p>Yes, and the 33 children they took from Haiti is not being talked about enough, that stuff is so huge. </p>

<p><a href="http://yournewswire.com/clinton-convicted-child-stealer-sex-trafficker/">http://yournewswire.com/clinton-convicted-child-stealer-sex-trafficker/</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Undeterred the group set out to collect orphans from the devastated town of Calebasse and from the slum of Le Citron in Port-au-Prince.  33 children (20 from Calebasse and 13 from Le Citron) were put under the mission’s care. On the night of January 29, the missionaries were arrested while trying to cross the Dominican border without proper authorization.</p>

<p>They denied any wrongdoing and maintained that they were doing God’s will by helping orphaned victims of the quake. The children were sent to the SOS Children’s Village orphanage in Croix-des-Bouquets, a suburb of Port-au-Prince, and it became clear that most (if not all) of them were not orphans.</p>

<p>NLCR missionaries maintained that they were told that the children were orphaned. In turn, people in Calebasse and SOS Children’s Villages accused the missionaries of lying about their intentions.</p>

<p>Although the children’s relatives were told that they would be able to visit them and eventually take them back, the NLCR’s mission statement clearly outlined plans for sending the kids to America for adoption.</p>

<p>The ten missionaries were charged with criminal association and kidnapping for trying to smuggle 33 children out of Haiti. In an interview, the United States Ambassador to Haiti Kenneth Merten, stated that the U.S. justice system would not interfere and added “the Haitian justice system will do what it has to do.”</p>

<p>The internet sleuths point out that Huma Abedin was constantly forwarding information about Laura Silsby and her NGO to Hillary Clinton during this period.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Wow. From the link:</p>

<p>Dhs.CON.N.E.B appears to be Saudi Arabian owned, this means the entire block both sides the street was bought by SAUDIA ARABIA and given to Friend&#39;s Andrew Kline for FREE in 2003</p>

<p>Con-NEB is National Engineering Bureau of Dubai/Saudi/Arab-Emigrate, owned by Saudi it is the largest construction company in the middle east and just so happens to own most of WASH-DC including all the property&#39;s associated with Pizzagate Now we&#39;re finding out that almost all of these are tied to andrew kline and not 5021 can do corpse-disposal with caustics and drainage, and 5029 is besta-pizza Conneb II LLC, H Gill &amp; Son - sold all on 2003, for $0 ( zero dollars )</p>

<p>[ Gill &amp; Son is WASH-DC realtor, CONNEB is Saudi Owner of entire block most likely all the way to DC Whitehouse ]</p>

<p>5013 = CVS Pharmacy and Moneygram</p>

<p>5015 = Politics &amp; Prose and The Den Coffeehouse and Wine Bar</p>

<p>5019 = Sheffields Wine &amp; Liquors</p>

<p>5020 = Exxon Gas Station</p>

<p>5021 = Regal Custom Wet Cleaners</p>

<p>5029 = Besta Pizza</p>

<p>5031 = Bucks Camping &amp; Fishing</p>

<p>5035 = Little Red Fox</p>

<p>5037 = Comet Ping Pong</p>

<hr/>

<p>Now, I&#39;m trying to look up  myself who owns these buildings, and these buildings have no entry in the dc tax assessor website, but all the ones around them do...</p>

<p>edit: Wait, I found it: <a href="https://www.taxpayerservicecenter.com/RP_Detail.jsp?ssl=1986%20%20%20%200006">https://www.taxpayerservicecenter.com/RP_Detail.jsp?ssl=1986%20%20%20%200006</a></p>

<p>CONNEB II LLC H GILL &amp; SON owned it when it was assessed in 2003, that&#39;s the last entry. Sale price undisclosed. Doesn&#39;t say who they sold it to. I wish I could find confirmation that CONNEB owns these DC buildings. </p>

<p>Now that I think of it, their family crest actually features a shield in a shield in a shield: <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a8/Great_coat_of_arms_of_Rothschild_family.svg/2000px-Great_coat_of_arms_of_Rothschild_family.svg.png">https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a8/Great_coat_of_arms_of_Rothschild_family.svg/2000px-Great_coat_of_arms_of_Rothschild_family.svg.png</a></p>

<p>Yes. Jews are small in number and tend to be insular, this makes them an easy minority to scapegoat.</p>

<p>Matt Marriott has some good articles about the Illuminati&#39;s attitude towards Jews.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well they try to pretend like Rothschild Judaism/Zionism is <em>the</em> Judaism, but not all Jews have been buying in to that, obviously. However since they have so much money and power, they only make huge successes out of people who believe what they believe, so the ideology has grown substantially over the last few hundred years as a result. They also control much of the global mainstream media, especially in the west, so they can spin whatever narratives they like that associate their family ideologies and actions with Judaism at large and it works on most non-jewish people because they don&#39;t know it&#39;s a trick. Like people think we have to invade Syria for the jewish people, to help out the poor jews, but really it&#39;s just the desire of the rothschilds to control that central bank and drill for oil there and lay pipelines and control those media markets. The two get so twisted, and the Rothschilds love it because it makes them more powerful.</p>

<p>I really wish more people understood how this game works, because there&#39;s so much power and effort going in to it and many people are oblivious and are having their money and power taken from them and used for war profiteering and central bank control of governments. It&#39;s disgusting and I&#39;m surprised more people don&#39;t see it. </p>

<p>Exactly. There are loads of <a href="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/3DM-3EEEamw/hqdefault.jpg">Jews who protest against Zionism</a>, something which the mainstream media rarely reports.</p>

<p>Yes, any Jew who opposes the Rothschilds gets called a &#39;self-hating jew&#39;. The media is classic, because it subtly portrays Jews as being &#39;protected&#39; whilst attacking Jews at every opportunity...</p>

<p>There are so many theories about the war in Syria. There&#39;s a theory that the rebels represent genuine opposition to the NWO/Rothschilds/Illuminati and that the west is only <em>pretending</em> to be against Bashar Assad...</p>

<p>I&#39;ve seen the theories about the war in Syria being part of the &#39;Greater Israel&#39; plan. Syria refuses to recognise Israel, so Syria can be considered an enemy of Israel.</p>

<p>Assad has said nothing of the fake ISIS attacks in the west, and he has said nothing about 9/11 either. This fact alone exposes Bashar Assad to be an ally of the USA and NATO.</p>

<p>I think the alliance between the USA and Israel is a fake one, we should never underestimate the Illuminati&#39;s capacity for deception...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Good points. Did you know over half of US jews do not support Zionism? <a href="http://mondoweiss.net/2012/09/the-true-crisis-of-zionism-silent-majority-of-us-jews-have-never-supported-it/">http://mondoweiss.net/2012/09/the-true-crisis-of-zionism-silent-majority-of-us-jews-have-never-supported-it/</a></p>

<p>The conflation between Rothschild Zionism and Jews is very deliberate by the Zionists. They want to build the greater Israel, like you mentioned, that the Torah promised them. And to do so they have to kick out Palestinians, overthrow all governments in the region (Iraq, Iran, Syria, Kuwait, Saudi, Lebanon, etc) which they&#39;ve basically mostly accomplished except for Syria and Iran, which are the thorn in their side. No small wonder the media is always railing against those two countries and their leaders, and we are constantly looking for reasons to go to war with these countries, basically combing their domestic disputes with a magnifying glass until we can justify the war to the public. And if we can&#39;t, then we just do a 9/11 or this: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzSjPDaSNMQ">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzSjPDaSNMQ</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ok I totally agree that Jews, as a group of people, are not evil and yes, they get wrongly lumped together in the same way that innocent Catholic priests get lumped into the evil abusers. But Israel the state wasn&#39;t taken over in the 70s. The same groups that planned Israels creation are the ones still in control now. </p>
