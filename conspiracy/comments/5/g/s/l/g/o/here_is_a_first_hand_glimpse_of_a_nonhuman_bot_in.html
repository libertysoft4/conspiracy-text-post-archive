I think people would be more likely to come around to seeing your point of view if they weren&#39;t berated into it initially. Also I have to plug the legitimacy of pizzagate, I know it&#39;s circumstantial at this point but man, the sheer number of coincidences defy any law of probability.

    <div class="md"><p>I agree, the facet of pizzagate that involves people showing up places irl, or accusing anyone, let alone those of differing opinions of being pedophiles is completely unnecessary and counter-productive at this point. 
I think it&#39;s the cause for the divide we see between people who are 100% pro-pizzagate we&#39;ll say vs. the portion of the &quot;deniers&quot; as some people call them who really just don&#39;t want to see people harassed or accused without evidence. I really wish we could bridge this gap because I think a lot of people are arguing here but want the same outcome and just don&#39;t realize it. </p>

<p>Here&#39;s the Hawaii information I mentioned, circumstantial again but still interesting imo</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Jesus Christ. I get why you feel the way you do even more now, that post by u/secondcomingOFfex is completely offside, and I say that as a staunch pizzagate supporter. No wonder people can&#39;t take it seriously. </p>

<p>The counter productivity has been prominent from the beginning I agree, taking action irl at this point is a fools errand because of the circumstantial nature of everything. I do support further investigation and questions though and if I understand you correctly, you do as well. </p>

<p>In terms of the divide, that post calling you out is a perfect example of fostering the divide. How likely is ANYONE to want to associate with a cause that has members that see no issue with posting something like that? Not very I bet. I myself am ashamed to be associated with people like that but I will condemn it as I see it as best I can. Willful ignorance is prominent like you said. </p>

<p>I believe the proposed outcome of a false flag involving cpp is vast internet censorship not just with regards to pizzagate, I personally see this as a looming issue no matter the the outcome of pizzagate. </p>

<p>Thanks for looking at the Hawaii stuff, honestly I hope you are the one that turns out to be right about the whole thing I really do, but at this point I&#39;m just not there myself. </p>

<p>I&#39;m inclined to believe that anyone using a bot wouldn&#39;t manually switch using RES, they&#39;d have seperate sessions for each account. Sorta like how private view windows are a seperate session that doesn&#39;t use the cookies or cache from your main session.</p>
