        <p><span class="badge badge-primary">72</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;2016-12-04 by <a class="author" href="../../../../../../../../user/applextrent.html">applextrent</a></p>
        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>First off, here&#39;s <a href="https://www.google.com/amp/www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-oakland-fire-nine-dead-warehouse-20161203-story,amp.html?client=safari">what happened</a>.</p>

<p>There&#39;s no conspiracy here that I&#39;ve seen. An art collective inside a warehouse in Oakland caught on fire while hosting a dance party with 60-80 people already inside. The poorly constructed building went up in flames which used scrap wood and a choke point makeshift wooden staircase during a rave trapping many of the people in attendance on the top floor. According to multiple witnesses the fire took less than 3 minutes to consume the entire structure. </p>

<p>If there is no conspiracy here, why am I posting this?</p>

<p>This is a perfect example of an actual news story. It&#39;s just now getting mainstream traction, and it happened Friday night. It took a tragedy of this magnitude nearly 12-18 hours to gain international media coverage. In fact, the foreign press covered this story faster than the American media.</p>

<p>The victims are actual people. I have several close friends who knew people at the venue and who are currently missing. Most of the dead or missing are DJs, musicians, photographers, and event producers who had just finished setting up.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve been able to find several witness reports in the media, as well as on social media and all the stories match up, and describe the same events.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve been able to find multiple eyes witness videos on Twitter, and YouTube as well. Something you almost never see with false flags or terrorist attacks.</p>

<p>This doesn&#39;t appear to be a false flag, these aren&#39;t actors,  and this appears to just simply be a giant tragedy resulting from multiple fire code violations and hazards that unfortunately caused this disaster when combined with some kind of spark or combustion.</p>

<p>If you want to study what an actual news story and tragedy looks like this is your chance. Learn from this so you can later distinguish from false flags and fake news narratives.</p>

<p>While it&#39;s still too early to tell what caused the fire, <a href="http://sfist.com/2016/12/03/pre-fire_photos_from_inside_oakland.php#photo-1">the building wasn&#39;t exactly up to code</a>. </p>

<p>Research this fire, and you&#39;ll see what real news looks like. It&#39;s so painfully obvious compared to the shit we&#39;ve been fed this election cycle.</p>

<p>Lastly, I&#39;m from the Bay Area and my heart goes to everyone affected by this fire. RIP. Please keep the trolling to a minimum, this isn&#39;t a conspiracy it actually happened. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Unlikely.</p>

<p>Most eye witnesses claim the fire started either on the first floor or in the basement. The event producers had just setup for a night of rotating DJs, which means there was probably thousands of dollars worth of DJ equipment and lighting that was brought with them.</p>

<p>So the odds of an electric fire or power surge are high. </p>

<p>The whole thing could have easily also been the result of someone smoking inside. The place was a tinderbox.</p>

<p>The cause of the fire is currently under investigation, but the party had just started at 11, and the fire started around 11:20ish and had consumed the building by 11:24. So if this was arson why would they set the building on fire before another hundred or so people were about to show up? If the intention was mass casualties had they waited an hour they could have done far more damage. </p>

<p>This was probably just a freak accident.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Why does the city of Oakland demand 30K permit for a basic fire safety sprinkler system. Shouldn&#39;t the city encourage fire safety by making it as easy and cheep as possible to comply with safety standards. I received solicitations for money to help build this ship. But how can we build creatively when the cost of a basic sprinkler system permit is outrageous. 30k for a 4&quot; pipe or 50K for a 6&quot; pipe. Safety permits should be free and inspections should be priced on cost of preforming them not a source of income. Other inspections can be do as part of the cities income but not safety.</p>

<p>There are many organizations in play. If you want to know the total cost on a project, talk to a builder, not the city. 30K in fees is about right, depending on the size of the system.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You probably are if you believe everything that&#39;s told to you without examining it critically.</p>

<p>Look into the history of the US education system and it&#39;s roots in the Prussian model if you still earnestly believe a degree alone makes you an authority.  You should also know that there are exceptions within academia to these dogmatic beliefs as well - so it would seem to me that you need to do some more research and stop trying to rationalize your ignorance :)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Going to college is a VERY good way to learn or grow the ability to think critically. Not sure where you are getting the &quot;authority&quot; bit, might need to re-read the comment. Anyway, the fact that 60% of the country hasn&#39;t completed college means that many people who are - to use your words - going to believe everything that&#39;s told to them without examining it critically. </p>

<p>Edit: facebook is a great example. The kids I went to school with who share the bulk of conspiracy theories tend to be those who least valued their education and failed to put in significant effort. Or have they discovered some new model of which I am ignorant? Obligatory :)</p>

If you put down the wrong answer, or challenge the conclusions the professor has drawn or the assumptions made then you don&#39;t pass the class.  Do you understand that?  Our education system does not encourage people to think critically - it encourages them to memorize and regurgitate.  It sounds like you have no clue what the education system is actually composed of - have you ever studied it&#39;s history?  About the Prussian education system as I mentioned?  Here, why don&#39;t you prove to me what a good student you are (because from your statements it seems to me that this is completely new material to you) and read The Leipzig Connection if you&#39;re unfamiliar - here&#39;s a link:</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t really care what niche topics you&#39;ve studied regarding the history of education. You can follow two young Americans from Kindergarten all the way up and come to two completely separate outcomes. Some will fail miserably and may not pursue higher education and others will learn to think critically, as I have. Same education system, entirely different outcomes. You can&#39;t blame the education system alone. Family culture, support, and values strongly influence an individual&#39;s will to learn and grow. Our education system has produced some of the brightest people in the world, and many not so bright individuals. It&#39;s far from perfect, but is not solely to blame.
Edit: I&#39;m not claiming to be a genius, but I think you are making our system out to be far more rudimentary than it is.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Burning Man started next to SF’s Presidio military base, as did the Church of Satan. Later it moved to another military zone, the Lovelock Gunnery Range in the Black Rock Desert, Nevada. Temple of Set founder Michael Aquino was running psychological operations at the Presidio at the time that Burning Man kicked off. The early founders of Burning Man used to spend a lot of time exploring the underground tunnels and bunkers there, which are riddled with Satanic, Nazi, and LSD-related images and paraphernalia.</p>

<p>The motif (a hooked cross) appears to have first been used in Neolithic Eurasia, perhaps representing the movement of the sun through the sky. To this day it is a sacred symbol in Hinduism, Buddhism, Jainism, and Odinism. It is a common sight on temples or houses in India or Indonesia. Swastikas also have an ancient history in Europe, appearing on artifacts from pre-Christian European cultures.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Why does the city of Oakland demand 30K permit for a basic fire safety sprinkler system. Shouldn&#39;t the city encourage fire safety by making it as easy and cheep as possible to comply with safety standards. I received solicitations for money to help build this ship. But how can we build creatively when the cost of a basic sprinkler system permit is outrageous. 30k for a 4&quot; pipe or 50K for a 6&quot; pipe. Safety permits should be free and inspections should be priced on cost of preforming them not a source of income. Other inspections can be do as part of the cities income but not safety.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve been to events like this before, and have friends who knew many of the victims.</p>

<p>These were mostly Millennial&#39;s of the Great Recession. They were typically sound of mind, and generally good people who had been disadvantaged due to globalization and inflation.</p>

<p>The people who lived there were mostly young adult artists who couldn&#39;t afford Bay Area rents and had likely been displaced or priced out of their homes in recent years. Mostly people in poverty with artistic inclinations. </p>

<p>The people attending the event were just young adults looking for a night out dancing and hanging out. Many of the missing are event promoters, DJs, photographers, musicians, and the people who helped setup the upstairs dance area. This group was mostly local event people who are well known in the community and their closest friends who came out for a night of fun.</p>

<p>These events usually don&#39;t peak capacity wise until midnight, sometimes later, so at 11:20pm many people had just arrived and the party was just getting started.</p>

<p>Make of this what you will, this is simply the reality of wealth inequality. I don&#39;t think it&#39;s fair to label these young adults as degenerates.</p>

<p>If there&#39;s any blame to place it is on the building manager who&#39;s responsibility it was the make sure the building was as safe as possible, and the building owner who ignored fire codes. The building had no functioning sprinkler system, fire alarms, or fire extinguishers. </p>
