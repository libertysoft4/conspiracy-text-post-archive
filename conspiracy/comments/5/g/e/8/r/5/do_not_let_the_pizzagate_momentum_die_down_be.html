        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Let me just take this opportunity to say do not let up on this. Stay on these people. We&#39;re in great shape right now because we have tons of pizzagate related posts making it to the top of the front page, which will bring tons of attention from the new visitors here.</p>

<p>Keep investigating and just FLOOD this fucking place with anything you find, upvote it, and discuss thoroughly each piece you bring in the comments. I&#39;ll admit I know this is a general conspiracy related forum, but I still truly believe Pizzagate, when brought to light, will finally bring these people down and destroy their credibility with the public. </p>

<p>I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if they tried to drown out Pizzagate related posts with other &quot;rabbit holes&quot; and &quot;dead ends&quot; and upvote them to the top (We&#39;ve already seen that Upvotes can be purchased online for 10c each). Just stay on it and don&#39;t let the momentum die down is my main concern. Doing a killer job so far mates, keep up the good work.</p>

<p>EDIT: I&#39;ve noticed the top post about Antarctica is close to the top with 350ish upvotes right now, did you read the first line? &quot;Pizzagate is a distraction from something big!&quot;..There may be some legitimate information worth looking at, but didn&#39;t it come at an extremely convenient time? This new random interest in Antarctica? This post is what i&#39;m refering to when I say look out for &quot;Dead End&#39;s&quot;. Please, judge for yourself, but i think it could potentially be just a little side rabbit hole they&#39;re gonna try and lead you down to divert your attention from our investigation into the Elite&#39;s involvement in human trafficking. Just be skeptical of every post and comment, but know that probably 90% of us on here are still doing god&#39;s work here, and we&#39;re behind you all the way.</p>

<p>EDIT: Not sure exactly what this means, but I recieved a PM from user &quot;anon31903&quot; who asked me to remove this post. When I refused, he simply replied with &quot;72 hours&quot;. Is this a mod? There is no post history with this user when I click on his name.   72 hours for what exactly? Weird....Thought i&#39;d bring it to everyone&#39;s attention.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It is true that Reddit is openly involved in censorship, and that the main discussion for Pizzagate should take place at Voat, but we should definitely try to dominate the front page here still, because theres at all times at least 300-500 people here on this sub, and around 8:00pm-12:00am there can be as many as 3,200! So think of all those new visitors we can reach. There is a pretty large audience here compared to voat, and many of them are new people who are just sparking an interest in pizzagate.</p>

<p>Them seeing pizzagate posts at the top of the front page will spark their interest in learning about the elite&#39;s involvement in human trafficking. </p>

<p>Also, request to the mods, whats up with this green duck graphic? Could you put the old graphic back up? What was the reasoning for removing it?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Is online conversation ever &quot;open&quot;? If I am at a dinner party and start talking about pedophile conspiracies (not a great dinner guest) people can say what they want, mostly. Some might agree, some might disagree and I will sit there and listen to all parties involved. Or, supposing I don&#39;t want to listen to this open conversation, it will take some effort for me to break with social niceties and yell at the person who disagrees, or interrupt others when they speak, or get up from the table to leave. Here&#39;s the thing. Online, it is easy to shut people down and shut people out. There is no such thing as an &quot;open&quot; discussion when you can ignore those people who disagree with you by down-voting them, or by closing a window. Having an &quot;open&quot; discussion on this forum requires that individuals intentionally seek-out dissenting opinions, and this (I think) is not a very common practice. </p>

<p>So there is a good general question of whether criminal allegations should be &quot;open&quot; for discussion or whether false allegations should be censored. But such a question, on this forum, presupposes that something like r/pizzagate is an open discussion, which it certainly is not. I have very little trust in the ability of reddit users (people in general - including myself in most areas where i operate without being critical of myself) to seek out those viewpoints that diverge from their own to reach a measured and tentative conclusion. </p>

<p>An aweful lot of the supposed &quot;evidence&quot; in this case seems to be based around the interpretation of swirls (there is an ice cream shop near my house that needs some serious investigation), ties between actors seem largely based on geographical proximity (is the neighbour of a criminal necessarily a criminal as well?), much seems the result of cherry picking a few sentences/images that seem most nefarious or confusing from lists of thousands (if you go through a photo album in my house you will find naked pictures of me as a child getting a bath, pictures of me sleeping, probably pictures of me with injuries, probably some topless groups of men standing around, but out of the hundreds or thousands of photos in my archive this is entirely normal... only by picking them out side by side would they appear to have some nefarious connotations). Still, there are some portions of the evidence that seem to be obviously related to pedophilia and occult imagery (though I wonder how far such themes can be written-off as &quot;art&quot;), and some connections between these actors that seem to indicate high concentration of such imagery (though such concentration may be a result of digging through mass amounts of information), and there do seem to be some oddities that are otherwise highly coincidental (though coincidence can also be the result of combing through mass amounts of information and picking out only the bits that support a certain narrative). It is easy to get caught up in the quality (or lack thereof) of evidence online because there is no &quot;open&quot; discussion here.</p>

<p>Personally, I don&#39;t think the question of whether conversation should be allowed to be &quot;open&quot; on reddit or other digital forums has much relevance. It is the individuals therein who are the real agents of censorship. We shouldn&#39;t be looking to blame reddit or other attempts to control conversation, we should be looking at ourselves and asking if we can be better in seeking an open discussion.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hope you don&#39;t mind if I continue this conversation because I find it quite interesting. </p>

<p>While at first what you say sounds right, I&#39;m concerned that what is considered substantial is defined by organizations that are outside of our control. For example when CNN does falsely reporting military tactics near Russia (as seen on the front page today), Fox News and MSNBC distort reality to fit Their audiences biases, who am I to decide what is substantial or not. In fact, one might argue that having free and open conversation especially on outlandish topics is the only way to ensure that there is a check on the power of the media.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t think that&#39;s outlandish, no?</p>

<p>Conducting a pedophile witchhunt in public with no evidence is unreasonable. If people are serious about the investigation they would gather and weigh evidence until they discovered something concrete.</p>

<p>So far there is nothing even remotely resembling reason for assuming pedophilia. The whole thing it based on a 4chan post randomly assigning code words, then you have to view the world through that code for any of it to make sense. It&#39;s outlandish in the extreme.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That is an excellent point. I agree that MSM really distorts and 100% pushes it&#39;s own agenda. Honestly, you&#39;re right an open discussion is healthy, but I think when the discussion seeks to paint someone as a pedophile and guilty of running a child sex trafficking ring out of a pizza shop without any concrete proof is harmful to the discourse. By allowing such a thing you are opening the door for anyone to launch such a claim and detract from the true issues that are facing this country right now. This topic in particular really seeks to divide us further and as someone who love this country and want to do anything I can to make it even better, I don&#39;t think this discussion serves to do that. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;d assume if there was direct proof the police would be already investigating. Dismissing things with &quot;there is no proof&quot; is stupid because usually the goal of any investigation is to get proof in the first place, and there&#39;s enough weird &quot;just a coincidence&quot; shit going on to investigate this in the first place... Starting with the pedo symbol logo then abruptly changing it. Unless you claim they unintentionally picked a pedo symbol as logo from the literal billions of possibilities for a logo. </p>

<p>Anyway back to the big picture: powerful people being into pedophilia is not exactly a conspiracy theory and I bet the same people who dismiss pizzagate will love to talk about the Catholic Church in the same regard... Maybe just your bias showing. If pizzagate is all fake then you still have people around like Jeffrey Epstein or Dennis Hastert, both convicted pedos.... But see, its always just a big coincidence.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Look, you are having a logical problem here. </p>

<p>You are right, police investigate crimes and find evidence. In the case of pedophiles they need a victim or images of such abuse or evidence such as cctv footage of suspicious behaviour. </p>

<p>What you have in pizzagate is a load of isolated information that you have built into a narrative of an elite pedophile ring you already belive exists. It is not evidence of anything. Like how many heavy metal bands would be in prison if their lyrics/instagram /album symbology were taken as evidence? </p>

<p>Until there is actual evidence of a pizza restaurant based crime, there is only a witch hunt to be had.    </p>

<p>There&#39;s also the series of links to child agencies.

<p>Bill brought in CPS reforms which provided financial incentives for children to be taken off parents. Nancy Shaefer was investigating it. She ain&#39;t around no more. </p>

<p>murders, rapes etc. would be dropped?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>in a murder/rape,  there is a victim,  or a missing person.    Right now,  on pizzagate we got a lot of creepy circumstantial &quot;talk&quot;,  but none of that is illegal.    What we need is something a real investigator would want to investigate,  a lead,  a real victim,  a real perpetrator with damning alleged physical involvement.    The strange symbols,  postings etc.  are not a lead.   They are a &quot;matter of possible interest&quot;.     It has to get warmer than that.   </p>

<p>But the amazing thing is that even at these tepid temperatures,  there has been this much interest diverted from normal conspiracy concerns,  like a new Goldman Sach treasurer,   or new developments in Syria,  new leads on 9/11,  and people being extremely emotional about the conjecture they are dealing with in pizzagate.    It seems like there is a psychological shift,  evidence of a psyopp.   On the other hand,   I am always glad to see the exposure of pedophilia,   Hastert,    Savile,  and other proven cases,  because it is at near epidemic levels as shown by real cases.    Where was the outrage at Hastert and those who had been covering up for him during sentencing here at r/conspiracy?    r/conspiracy didn&#39;t care,   and it had real witnesses,  real victims,  higher ups involved in a cover up,  interfering with justice.    And then pizzagate comes along and r/conspiracy goes ape shit as if this time it is sure to take down Washington.   I don&#39;t get it.</p>

<p>The FBI&#39;s Joseph Campbell says child exploitation in the US has reached near-epidemic levels. <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-33682953">http://www.bbc.com/news/world-33682953</a>  “The level of pedophilia is just unprecedented right now,” Campbell said. “We have so many cases constantly of individuals in all walks of life, from the very wealthy … to all other levels engaged in child pornography, child exploitation … it just seems to be almost an at epidemic level.”</p>

I&#39;d say its alone pretty suspious if someone&#39;s 3 closest friends ALL turn out to be pedos and that&#39;d already require investigation alone, and no I wouldnt mind if the same happened to me, because I dont think I know a single pedo, its statistically very unlikely that 3 of your closest friends turn out to be pedos... unless you are one as well, of course. </p>

<p>Please tell me if having pedos around you is a reasonable doubt for you to start asking questions or not. Mind that in any police investigatio just seding emails to a pedo might make them question you, that alone does not mean you are a pedo.</p>

<p>The thing is those symbols are all similar or equal to basic graphic elements that will appear all over. A line receding into itself, common, hearts, super common. Those are not proof of anything, and it would be silly to assume that a global pedo ring advertises itself to the common gutter pedos via well-known and exposed symbolism.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Convicted pedos, child trafficing</p>

<p>And no evidence at all that Alefantis or Podesta have ever harmed or been involved in harming anyone.  Yet they have been publicly labeled as monsters based on <em>zero evidence</em>. That is incredibly uncool, that is so cruel. These people have not been proved to be guilty of anything, yet there lives are being bashed about like they&#39;ve been caught red-handed. If a serious investigation is what is wanted, this is not the way to go about it. Pizzagate is hysteria, moonbarking frothing-at-the-mouth hysteria. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Do you think police have certain procedures for investigation because it makes it more fun?  Or do you think that they have them because they make for more effective investigations?  I&#39;m convinced it&#39;s the latter but you&#39;re welcome to disagree.<br/>
If you honestly can&#39;t wrap your head around the &quot;innocent until proven guilty concept&quot; that I&#39;m asking you to acknowledge then I don&#39;t think we can have an honest discussion, you just aren&#39;t paying attention.
My point is that you are free to conduct your &quot;investigation&quot; however you want, but if you don&#39;t conduct it effectively then people will assume that the information you uncover is bs.  Now I think we all know why that won&#39;t happen, if you conducted this thing like professional investigators would conduct it then you wouldn&#39;t get anywhere because there probably isn&#39;t anything to find.   So when those tried and true methods come up empty, you have to compromise a bit and use more and more questionable methods.

    <div class="md"><p>Exactly. I feel like pizzagate is a huge distraction. There is absolutely no solid evidence yet the obsession has gotten out of hand. I have no doubt that the cp rings exist in higher society and even within our government, but this particular &quot;scandal&quot; is just one giant dead end that I see. </p>

<p>I have no problem with people doing research, but to see a video of people outside of that ping pong place basically harassing the owner when they have no solid evidence is cringy.</p>

<p>Meanwhile in Dakota protesters are being sprayed with freezing water and abused with pepper spray. This is something that is actually happening and is being actively ignored by msm.</p>

<p>I know I&#39;ll probably get downvoted, like I said if you feel that there is something more there by all means keep researching, but when I come to this sub and see 18 pizza gate posts on the front page rehashing all the same thing with no solid evidence its gets a little old.</p>

<p>And why are you discouraging an investigation into ANYTHING that implicates the elite? This is a conspiracy forum, right?

<p>I never said anything close to the words you just made up. I said I certainly wouldn&#39;t be surprised if they did, and I think it&#39;s fair to say there are sex slaves in every country.

<p>Silsby gets pulled for child trafficking in Haiti</p>

<p>Silsbys legal advisers turns out to be a fugitive wanted for his connections to trafficking. </p>

<p>Hillary intervenes to help Silsby. </p>

<p>Silsby ends up working for the company that provides Amber Alerts system. </p>

<p>The NCMEC is the organisation that is in charge of the amber alert programme. </p>

<p>When images turn up online that match certain hashes they get flagged and sent to NCMEC. NCMEC verifies that they are CP and then makes the decision to send them on to the authorities or not. The internet company themselves never sees the images. This means that NCMEC gets the final word on whether or not the images get passed to the authorities. </p>

<p>The ICMAC was founded by NCMEC, Hillary was at the launching of this. Jeffrey Koons sits on the board and is a friend of both Alefantis and David Brock. Brock&#39;s company CTR was given $50,000 by Koons and Alefantis knows Koons through the DC art scene. Koons is also on side with the Clintons. </p>

<p>The board of ICMAC includes Koons. It also includes Bagley who donated $1,000,000 to the Clinton Foundation and Lichtbuer whose organisation Child Focus is linked to child abuse. </p>

<p>The money connections extend to known ME child traffickers, A woman investigating the Clinton Foundation and child trafficking in Haiti died recently etc. </p>

<p>One family happens to be linked to a disturbing number of child trafficking/abuse rings and also connected to child protection organisations. How peculiar. Must all be a coincidence. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Amber Alerts don&#39;t do child porn, they do missing children alerts. </p>

<p>What is ICMAC?</p>

<p>Who is Koons, and why does he matter?</p>

<p>Given there&#39;s been absolutely <em>nothing</em> beyond conjecture regarding Alefantis and Brock, they&#39;re irrelevant, as of yet. </p>

<p>Who is Bagley?</p>

<p>So far, you&#39;ve got all of 1 actual connection to someone actually connected to child trafficking, maybe 2, depending on who Bagley is. Given the Clintons, by virtue of being established politicians, know and come into contact with a <em>lot</em> <em>lot</em> <em>lot</em> of people, it&#39;s not surprising they&#39;ve come into contact with a couple of genuine creepy shitty people without ever knowing how shitty they are. You never see a news report featuring the neighbor of a apprehended molester saying &quot;Oh yeah, I knew he was fucking kids for years.&quot; Generally speaking, molestering isn&#39;t something one shares with people they meet.</p>

<p>To look at it from another angle, is Trump tied to human trafficking? He had a company VP busted on a boat with underaged prostitutes, used Polish workers who had been trafficked in, Hung with Epstein on his island, at Mar-a-Lago, and in his apartment in Trump Tower, spoke of Epstein&#39;s taste for young girls, and worked with - and allowed his daughter to work for - John Casablancas, who trafficked in models/escorts. That&#39;s every bit as much evidence - likely more, since there&#39;s actual supporting documentation - as there is of Clinton being involved with such things. But a pizza party is the end of the world.</p>

The actual medical examiner who did Breitbarts autopsy is still alive and well.  But somehow conspiracy theorists have latched onto this as a fact that his coroner was murdered.</p>

Is that suspicious, or was that the cancer that ate her apart slowly from the inside? Six years ago you likely said something shitty about someone else...does that automatically mean the shitty thing you said is true? And why haven&#39;t many, many, many more people died besides Breitbart? Is he - after tweeting it - the only person who &quot;knew the truth&quot; he was killed over? Or did he just say something assholely about a guy he didn&#39;t like and unfortunately died younger than average?</p>

<p>Seriously the idea of people on this board discouraging a citizen investigation seems to ridiculous to not be CTR...Especially involving pedophilia?! These are fucking kids you sick fucks, why would you do that? </p>

<p>I want everyone to be skeptical of everything they see, hear or read, but that includes being skeptical of some of the members who are essentially begging and pleading us to stop researching.</p>

<p>I&#39;m going through some of the users on this post and archiving their post history and their activity patterns here, and I will try to come up with a database of who seems to be a genuine user and who is potential CTR.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Jesus christ dude, you said &quot;They did do it. <strong><em>They just aren&#39;t operating alone.</em></strong>&quot; Since we&#39;re talking about this in terms of countries, that implies other countries helped them. Unless what you meant is that they have people in the US helping them(which they would have to). I don&#39;t even know how that is contradicting me, nor how I&#39;m contradicting you entirely.</p>

<p>The MSM are going to blame <em>everything</em> on <strong><em>only</em></strong> <em>Russia</em> which is dangerous because it could start a war. They were already trying to do it throughout the election, and are still doing it via the fake news narrative, and are acting on it with the bill to &quot;combat Russian propaganda sites&quot;.</p>

<p>I&#39;m trying to make the point that while what you&#39;re saying could be true, the entirety of your statement that blankets multiple countries/entities will be focused on only Russia, who is being setup to be the scapegoat.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Do you even know my views or are you assuming something you don&#39;t know? </p>

<p>As to your question, absolutely. See, I&#39;ve never been a partisan shill. I don&#39;t like either party. I&#39;ve never liked TPTB. So, that&#39;s why I support the one candidate that the establishment bastards tried so hard to destroy. The candidate the MSM continually tries to twitst into something he&#39;s not. The one candidate that scares me hell out of the globalist supporting vermin. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have. Would you rather he pick a Taco Bell janitor for Treasurer? It was going to be a financial person, since (news flash) it&#39;s a FINANCIAL position. The guy isn&#39;t a long time government freak. After Dodd-Frank, the &quot;too big to fail&quot; got bigger. If not Goldman Sachs, it would have been Chase, or another big institution. I expected that. Same with Mad Dog. I don&#39;t want a tree hugging Islam sympathizer over the military. No thanks.</p>

<p>Petraeus was simply tossed out there to get the shills spun up and have them admit Hillary wss unqualified. The media and zealots made his case for him. It was brilliant. You should have been paying attention long enough to know that Trump will use judo against the media and establishment.</p>

<p>You should probably pay closer attention.</p>

<p>I have to ask. Who is your savior of America? Is it the scammer Stein? Is it the man who made back room deals with the DNC and was simply a money raising conduit between millennials and Hillary? Was it Hillary (LOL)? Or was it the GOP establishment backed Johnson and his long time Republican running mate? Do tell.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The vast majority of the evidence IS circumstantial at this point, in my opinion that necessitates more investigation. The answer to circumstantial evidence is not to stop investigating, there is no truth in that tactic. My biggest question is from this email </p>

<p><a href="https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/32795">https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/32795</a></p>

<p>Why does the real estate agent refer to the handkerchief as black and white, while Susan Sandler describes it completely differently? A handkerchief, that she thinks has a map, that seems pizza related? Obviously these would be highly identifying characteristics, why does the real estate agent not use them in her description? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Aside from the FBI documents outlining the symbolism I personally have chosen to leave &quot;code words&quot; on the back burner until there is more concrete evidence for it. It is an interesting thought though. </p>

<p>I just can&#39;t reconcile the fact that if the handkerchief did in fact have the graphics like the one you linked, they would be included in any and conceivably every description. 
For example when someone leaves an article of clothing at my house, my effort to find the owner includes description of any information on tags, colour, size, description of graphics, stains or holes etc. Anything less than a complete description is illogical. In the case of this email we have two vastly different descriptions with no explanation. For me right now, I must know why, and I feel that if a person can&#39;t answer this one simple question they cannot say it&#39;s not worth investigating. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m choosing not to speculate on &quot;code words&quot; at this time as I believe there&#39;s no hard evidence to support them, that does not mean that I don&#39;t think they&#39;re being used.

<p>What I do believe is that there is a verifiable breakdown in logic, due to the vastly different descriptions given by the two individuals in the email.

    <div class="md"><p>You do realize though, that seeing connections at that level and believing that people are speaking in code, are common symptoms of schizophrenia.  Conspiracies can stay credible to a point, but when it&#39;s making a narrative out of people just making references to other conversations, or emailing their inside jokes, it&#39;s a little insane.  Especially when the code that people claim they&#39;re using originated on 4chan in the first place.  People in government positions don&#39;t browse 4chan, and people on 4chan don&#39;t understand how normal people talk.</p>

<p>It&#39;s terrible, because there are proven child abuse coverups out there that would be much easier to hack wide open.  It hurt me that we finally saw someone upvoted for connecting pizzagate to the Catholic Church, only after the first shots were fired over Comet.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What made me believe in pisagate was this video that was posted on youtube. Its back from 2007 I believe. Some dude working in the insurance industry stood across the street from comet ping pong and placed his camera on the ground and filmed two people playing ping pong outside of coment, trying to figure out liability issues like who would be responsible if the ball hit a car or something. If you turn up the volume in that video you could hear kids screaming &quot;help me&quot; &quot;im down here&quot; &quot;heeelllpp&quot;. This is a youtube video that was uploaded in 2007 and also has a caption in video stating the date, 2007, so this was before this pisagate thing blew up. They say that cometpingpong has an underground system of tunnels where they have the kids and do their pedo shit so to me this video gave more evidence of it possibly being 100% real. If i can find the video ill post it, should have saved it before :( </p>

<p>If it really IS in the video, in front of comet ping pong, in 2007, then that is suspicious. That is assuming it&#39;s not like those ghost shows where they hear static or breathing in the mic and say &quot;oh he said get out!&quot;. If it is, I agree that he&#39;s looking for it. If it&#39;s pretty obvious what they&#39;re saying(if they&#39;re saying anything) then that&#39;s suspicious.</p>

<p>Then we have to wonder how the fuck he can hear them, because you can&#39;t really hear stuff from at least 10 feet underground, unless there was some sort of vent or something nearby(which I doubt there was).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>While it is circumstantial, it is a large amount of circumstantial evidence. The fact that it is met with such fierce opposition suggests there is something larger at play. What is happening now and what has been happening has been an obvious cover up. If they had an explanation, they would have come out with it. However, they continue to deflect, dodge, and ignore any evidence pertaining to this. I mean here&#39;s a block in D.C. with a majority of the businesses having FBI recognized pedophilia related symbols, it was a <em>gift</em> involving Saudi groups, and it implicates government officials. It all seems pretty fitting of a conspiracy theory. But if you bring it up, there is a large group who completely dismiss it and argue that it should not be discussed. I just think everyone should be open minded and look at any possibility. And look at the possible <em>reasons</em> the elites have for doing what they do.</p>

<p>I&#39;m a fan of the X-Files, as are alot of other people probably,  and the biggest issue for Mulder and Scully was finding the hard evidence before Smoking Man or the Syndicate or Krycek got to it first. All of their paranormal experiences, alien encounters, conspiracy leads from members of higher levels of govt,  didn&#39;t mean anything without the actual <em>hard evidence</em>, the scientific mathematical, biological proof (of an alien virus or dna for example). </p>

<p>And the people behind those conspiracies got to the smoking gun first using tactics that included murder,  spying, discrediting,  distracting,  etc. </p>

<p><em>Why is it so absurd to think that these people are making it impossible for us to find that smoking gun?  Especially since they have the power,  the influence, the connections, the money, the tools, the necessity and determination and fear (of not being exposed).</em></p>

    <div class="md"><p>There isn&#39;t a smoking gun yet, but there are definitely things that cause suspicion.

<p>Web sleuths then found an interview with the pizza place owner from a much earlier date stating that <strong>his tomatoes are homegrown,  in the basement of his establishment.</strong></p>

    <div class="md"><p>Wait, so this sub no longer believes in say the JFK assassination or 9/11 being an inside job, but it does believe in a conspiracy literally invented by trolls on 4chan based on the idea that a pizza joint owner would never use the word &quot;pizza&quot; in a sentence unless it was a code for child rape?</p>

<p>Or are you saying this sub still believes in those other things but a child sex ring is more important than government forces killing the president to allow for the Vietnam War or those same forces killing over 2000 people to start two endless wars we are still involved in 15 years later?</p>

<p>Frankly when your evidence is comprised of a single 4chan post claiming pizza is a code for child molestation, that families who liked a pizza place on social media also have pictures of children on their feeds, and there is a vague, vague connection to a NY performance artist who does weird shit rural voters in Indiana and Kansas don&#39;t quite understand...um basically you&#39;ll believe anything.</p>

<p>You know, it is said that Scientology was started with a bar bet that it couldn&#39;t be done. This alleged scandal is made from the same cloth. Anti-Clinton trolls were sitting around saying let&#39;s make up something super damaging about Clinton with whatever evidence we can scrape up. You guys are being trolled, hard core. You&#39;re missing the true conspiracy here, which was to plant this fake crap in the first place. You have been duped hook, line, and sinker.</p>

<p>A conspiracy theorist use to be someone with an extreme amount of skepticism for everything. Sadly, it appears now a conspiracy theorist is someone with not the tiniest ounce of skepticism at all.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There&#39;s really nothing <em>to</em> know about the Podesta emails. People had a pizza party. They talked about it, and they had one. Because the emails were released, the public knows they got together to eat pizza. Then, because a few members of the public don&#39;t have multiple email strings to plan their own pizza party, they decided it <em>must</em> mean something else. And then they picked the ugliest option possible, and played a game of mad libs with it, picking certain words and attaching meaning to those words as code words to support the ugly conclusion they&#39;d already reached. They could&#39;ve just easily decided cheese pizza meant &quot;Chevrolet,&quot; and then ascribed other car-related meaning to other words. But that wouldn&#39;t be dramatic and evil, so they went with meanings that <em>prove</em> they have a better reason to dislike the people they already dislike. Cheese pizza could actually, and very likely does, mean cheese pizza.</p>

<p>No. Bullshit. &quot;cheese pizza&quot; and &quot;cheese pizza&quot; alone refers to child porn. The rest of it (map = semen, hot dog = boy) is 4chan bullshit. Unless you have a pre-November 2016 government source for all those supposed code words?</p>

<p>Ok, I&#39;ll settle for any government source. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s confirmation bias, my friend.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not saying anyone should stop.</p>

<p>However, those who consider the fight to shut down the #pizzagate movement as definitive evidence that it&#39;s true are actually hurting the movement. Circumstantially it supports the argument, but there are a couple reasons people would try to shut it down.</p>

<p>It&#39;s a fallacy of logic to insist that the only possible reason is one that corroborates and validates your view.  To outsiders and skeptics, seeing arguments like this will scare them away. It will also alienate you from some people who hold belief or some suspicion.</p>

<p>It&#39;s okay to use this as a supporting theory, but it&#39;s doesn&#39;t &#39;prove&#39; everything.</p>

Must have taken me to a different site than the one you&#39;re referring to because all I saw was a random nonsensical tweet from a fat hate-filled man with hardened arteries who died after having a second major heart attack in the span of a few months. </p>

<p>What possible basis do you have for saying his death was other than a heart attack? How in the world does that tweet establish anything other than the dude liked to rant on twitter about his political adversaries? Breitbart gets killed for tweeting but Alex Jones&#39; tubby ass gets to spread his insanity far and wide for decades?</p>

<p>You all have truly picked the perfect conspiracy. There is literally nothing that could prove your theory wrong. Everything can be misconstrued to fit the narrative. Innocuous emails about food can only be about 1 thing: a massive satanic pedophile ring. There&#39;s never going to be an investigation based on this &quot;evidence&quot; so that must just be further proof of how deep the conspiracy goes. </p>

<p>Because they were investigating Anthony Weiner when they asked the FBI to reopen the case. Anything the FBI currently has that caused them to reopen the case was originally under the NYPD. Multiple officers have come out saying they found some damning evidence that would make anyone nauseous.</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p>So if the NYPD has something, and it&#39;s a part of a state investigation, what is the problem? More importantly, who are these NYPD officers you&#39;re referring to?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Prince is a radio talk show host who says that officers were willing to give a press conference but DOJ told them to stand down. Officers are being told that if they release this information they&#39;ll be charged with obstructing an open investigation.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>They&#39;re conducting their own investigation at a state level. If the FBI didn&#39;t take everything they have what would be the grounds on charging them with obstructing an open investigation? Who exactly is Prince? You are quoting the guy or someone who wrote about him but not citing sources. Who are the officers involved?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Do you really believe the FBI reopened that case just to make sure they were accurate? They were protecting the DNC and Hillary before a presidential election in hopes of running out the clock. The NYPD has everything the FBI has, they&#39;re simply unable to announce anything.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I believe they reopened it to keep the public focused on the emails. </p>

<p>And you know this how? Again, if they are conducting their own investigation at a state level, the FBI is not going to issue a gag order as they have no jurisdiction over the states investigation as the two are independent of each other.</p>

<p>There is no obstruction charge because no NYPD officer has publicly come out yet. There is a potential obstruction charge, very different.</p>

<p>You have FOI filings. And there was no gag order.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The FBI can assume jurisdiction when a states investigation conflicts with an ongoing federal investigation. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Incorrect. The FBI can&#39;t assume jurisdiction when a states investigation conflicts with an ongoing investigation. That is what you see on TV and the movies. What will happen, in the case of malfeasance and corruption, is they will remove those people and have others come in. But the two are different because, in a lot of instances, they&#39;re looking at different crimes and using different statutes.</p>

<p>Here is what the FBI has said about your claims:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.fbi.gov/about/faqs/if-a-crime-is-committed-that-is-a-violation-of-local-state-and-federal-laws-does-the-fbi-take-over-the-investigation">https://www.fbi.gov/about/faqs/if-a-crime-is-committed-that-is-a-violation-of-local-state-and-federal-laws-does-the-fbi-take-over-the-investigation</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>They simply had to reopen a case to claim jurisdiction, which the FBI did.</p>

<p>So you are saying the NYPD asked the FBI to reopen the case? So they could have jurisdiction?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Unable to download the PDF, I&#39;ll go on my desktop in a minute. Usually can download PDFs fine.</p>

<p>There are two links. The first is a pdf and the second one isn&#39;t. Both explain, in detail, what obstruction of justice actually is and it isn&#39;t what you and your uncited sources are saying.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You make a lot of assumptions here, mate. Where do I say I believe everything you THINK I believe? 
You just insult us all here because you can. I never listen to anyone who can&#39;t form an intelligent sentence but instead reverts to childish insults. You sound frustrated. Therefore I was asking why you put yourself through so much anguish and come to this sub.</p>

<p>I personally do not have to give you any evidence at all, you have eyes, you have fingers, go and do some actual research and then answer me if you&#39;d be happy for people like the likes of Pizza gate to  babysit your own children. </p>

<p>If the answer is yes, then either you have not done any research whatsoever and are just parroting your opinion without knowledge.</p>

<p>If you say No, then I assume it may be alright to ask for someone to have a closer look at these people. </p>

<p>It&#39;s not that paedo-rings don&#39;t exist at all. If we were going on about yetis or aliens, then your infantile, unresearched opinion may be warranted. But come on man, these things are quite common. 
You&#39;d probably would have defended Jimmy Saville. Because there was no evidence either [apart from a couple of victims].
Problem is that the evidence you want can only be obtained if the police were allowed to &#39;take a quick closer look&#39;.</p>

<p>Something you are obviously against. </p>

<p>If you decide to answer me, could you do without the swearing? it isn&#39;t very becoming and adds nothing. Thanks </p>

<p>Is correct. There is no real evidence right now. </p>

<p>Indeed. And, just for sake of argument, let&#39;s assume (briefly) Podestas et al are NOT pedophiles. Regardless, <em>are you going to let your children anywhere near a creep that admires Jeffrey Dahmer</em> enough to commission a life size recreation of one of his <a href="http://www.abeldanger.org/web/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/tony-podesta-and-jeffrey-dahmer.png">victims?</a></p>

<p>Or hang out with these <strong><em>truly deplorable freaks</em></strong> that embrace <a href="https://didreyfus.files.wordpress.com/2016/11/img_2679.png?w=1108&amp;amp;h=737&amp;amp;crop=1">this kind of art?</a></p>

<p><del>Why the cryptic emails with obvious code like &quot;older pizzas that we&#39;re having a special on, some are in poor health though [wtf]&quot; <a href="http://i3.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/facebook/001/191/240/9f1.jpg">?</a></del></p>

<p>And then there&#39;s the known pedophile symbolism used in the <a href="http://stateofthenation2012.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Screen-Shot-2016-11-12-at-9.34.16-AM.png">logo</a> they&#39;ve since removed once they were outed, (but hey, if ya got nothing to hide, ya got nothing to worry about, right?)</p>

<p>Yeah, just going on the circumstantial evidence alone, they should be gearing up for a multitude of rigorous and thorough investigations of these weird <del>mother</del>childfuckers.</p>

<p>This is merely a small sample of what&#39;s out about this BS; there&#39;s more, much more. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4OP--ZXOjc">What we know so far.</a></p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong> Wrong link &amp; couldn&#39;t find the exact one I&#39;d seen (there seems to be quite a bit of cryptic emails gleaned from WikiLeaks) but, <a href="http://lunaticoutpost.com/thread-713453-post-13396219.html">here&#39;s</a> some related <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM4I5cK4qf4">info</a></p>

<p>Again, the circumstantial evidence is mounting. There&#39;s already <strong>plenty</strong> to <em>warrant</em> an investigation.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is probably the largest force of amateur investigations there has ever been (at least recently) against the elite.  If it&#39;s true, then you know they are scrambling to cover this up, create distractions and shill on reddit.  When it comes to other conspiracies, there&#39;s nothing we can really do.  Are we all going to travel to Antarctica and look for aliens?  No?  Then keep digging into pizzagate.</p>

<p>spez:  Worst comes to worst, pizzagate isn&#39;t real, but we might find other child abduction rings or pedo rings in the process of looking.  We could actually do some good instead of prepping our tinfoil hats.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Because conspiracies really exist, they really do. I even gave you an example of one in my original comment (Watergate). You are NOT thinking critically, and your wording betrays your cognitive bias.</p>

<p>If you&#39;re offended by me challenging <strong><em>&quot;your reality&quot;</em></strong>, it&#39;s because there&#39;s no such thing as <strong><em>&quot;your reality&quot;</em></strong>, there&#39;s just reality. Reality doesn&#39;t change because you give it a silly label, or because you <strong><em>choose</em></strong> to believe in something.</p>

<p>I&#39;m offended that when I bring up real issues, with real evidence, I get dismissed because of people like you. There are so many people like you making shit up and polluting the waters that real issues are dismissed because they get grouped with bullshit like &quot;pizzagate&quot;.</p>

<p>You are NOT thinking critically, and there is no such thing as subject reality. Why am I here? Because years ago there were interesting discussions <strong><em>and evidence</em></strong> provided in links regarding political conspiracies and back-door dealings. But now it&#39;s full of people like you making us all look bad.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You clearly have a bias on this topic.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes, I&#39;m biased against bullshit and fantasies based on nothing.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Why do you care so much? Aren&#39;t you supposed to support critical thinking and questioning of the norm, not DISCOURAGE it?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;ve now explained why I care, it&#39;s because the truth, <em>the reality</em> of a topic is important. There is no reality to this pizzagate bullshit.</p>

<p>And I AM supporting critical thinking skills, but you haven&#39;t demonstrated any critical thinking. You&#39;re simply getting defensive when challenged. If you had evidence for &quot;your reality&quot; you&#39;d have presented it. But you haven&#39;t. Because there is no evidence.</p>

<p>That&#39;s what critical thinking skills are about, the ability to recognise what your biases are <em>and address them</em>. You think I&#39;m biased because I&#39;ve only ever said negative things about pizzagate? <em>Please tell me why I should believe it.</em> I don&#39;t choose what I believe, I&#39;m driven to believe what I see to be evidently true. You&#39;ve given me NO reason to think pizzagate is based in any demonstrable reality.</p>

<p>That&#39;s why I get the shits with bullshit like pizzagate, because you poison the well and make it harder to expose <strong><em>real</em></strong> conspiracies.</p>

<p>From your link</p>

<p>&quot;Pizzagate is a real phenomenon, children are in danger&quot;</p>

<p>Yeah you&#39;re the one being hysterical, not to mention there is no proof on that page. Just a list of people who have been arrested proving that child abuse is a real thing, which nobody was ever arguing. What it doesn&#39;t prove is any connection of pedophilia to the pizza restaurant beyond modern art which people find creepy and the fact that they said the word pizza in an email referring to a pizza place. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The Wiki itself is obviously a work in progress, but quite a bit of research goes into sources themselves and verifying information used in its pages.

<p>There&#39;s nothing hysterical about solemn facts. Could you honestly refute either of those statements? I meant that to be thought provoking because strangely enough human trafficking exists on a scale more prolific than that of violent crime and international terrorism, but nobody ever hears about those crimes or their perpetrators. </p>

<p>For various reasons, John Podesta&#39;s connection to a bizarre pizza place was the first time Americans openly discussed and published information on the subject without being completely censored and belittled. In its own way Pizzagate has been one of the best exercises of the First Amendment and the public&#39;s civic duty to monitor and audit its representatives.

Not to mention the completely misleading statistics at the start, about 800,000 children going missing every year that have been refuted by the author of the study. </p>

<p>And you think harassing an innocent man, harassing his family, his business and now showing up at his restaurant with a fucking rifle threatening to kill him over literally nothing is a good exercise of first amendment rights?  Harassment isn&#39;t covered under the first amendment. </p>

<p>&quot;Say what you will, but the truth comes out more every day.&quot;</p>

<p>And yet nothing concrete, all circumstantial bullshit tied together with string and fucking delusion.</p>

<p>Edit: <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-32386685">link</a> to the author of the study taking about how the number is overblown. Also to add I am not saying nothing should be done because it&#39;s overblown, I still think every effort should be made to rescue kids from those horrible situations.

    <div class="md"><p>The people arguing for evidence here are completely clueless about pizzagate in general. I could ask them a series of simple questions such as, &quot;How did the &quot;Pizzagate&quot; investigation start?&quot; or &quot;Suspect language was discovered in the emails of what important figure of the 2016 HRC presidential campaign? What was the suspect language and what was it believed to be used for?&quot; or &quot;Name at least 7 businesses that are potentially implicated in the pizzagate scandal&quot;, and they wouldn&#39;t be able to answer ANY of them. </p>

<p>See, most of the people who deny any theory such as this, are usually uneducated on the topic to begin with. You can easily call them out by testing their knowledge of the subject with a few questions, and if they can&#39;t even give you a summary of the basic structure or present a rudimentary understanding of the topic at hand, then their opinion on the topic doesn&#39;t matter. Why would the opinion of someone who isn&#39;t educated on the subject hold any merit? Especially against someone who actually spent countless hours researching it?</p>

<p>Now, since this is the internet, these idiots can just go google the information real quick and come back and pretend like they knew the answers all along and claim to have researched thoroughly, but the fact that almost everyone here is ASKING for us to present them with our links and findings, shows that they clearly haven&#39;t even looked into it at all! They were just immediately turned away by the media&#39;s shit smear with the &quot;conspiracy&quot; &quot;alt-right&quot; buzzwords, and they&#39;re echoing that same crap here (on a forum where critical thinking and questioning is supposed to be encouraged, mind you).</p>

<p>Either that, or they&#39;re shills...I assume most of the shills here are actually well versed and have a fundemental understanding of Pizzagate and are familiar with the matrix of links and evidence we&#39;ve presented. They are going to be more effective at opposing the idea if they are relatively familiar with it, so they can better attack it, learn it&#39;s points of vulnerability, and have the trust of other users on the board. </p>

<p>Because you&#39;re accusing somebody of being a pedophile with no evidence. And no an Instagram post or an email with supposed &quot;code words&quot;that were never liked to pedophilia until this &quot;scandal&quot; broke aren&#39;t evidence. Neither is saying he was in a room one time with a guy who was once in a room with a convicted sex offender. </p>

<p>You are already convinced he&#39;s a pedophile, so when you see an Instagram picture with any child your mind automatically assumes the worse, even if it&#39;s not. Put up something not tied together with string and conjecture and then maybe people will take you seriously. </p>

Seems like you are trying to promote the idea that Pizzagate investigation is only centered around Comet Ping Pong and James Alefantis. That is evidence that you clearly have not even bothered to look into this subject at length whatsoever. We&#39;re focusing on the bigger picture, exposing human trafficking at the highest levels of society. It&#39; already been exposed in the Catholic church, and several politicians and billionaires and members of royalty have been implicated as well in SEVERAL countries, time and again. This is fact.

The way the shills are now suddenly and uniformily using this as leverage and hiding behind it in an attempt to make our investigation look whacky, it&#39;s possible that it could have potentially been enacted by Comet.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not exactly sure about the camera deal. I&#39;ve seen some screen grabs that show it looking at Nebraska ave towards Wisconsin/Reno roads and it is currently looking @ Connecticut towards md. I don&#39;t know the ins and outs of traffic camera use, but it&#39;s definitely possible that they change the view on different days/times because statistically there are more accidents, etc. So far I see no proof of it being intentionally pointed away, and I honestly have no idea if it is ever used to look at the comet side of the street. Generally cams are used facing the traffic on the side of the street where the camera is located to see license plates (which in this case would not be the comet side). It is also possible that the camera is looking for rush hour traffic so in the am we would expect Connecticut towards md and in the afternoon Connecticut towards downtown DC. On weekends there is less concern about rush hour traffic and the reversible lanes used during rush hour (instead of 3/3 it goes 4/2 to accommodate more rush hour traffic) are not in effect, so the camera may be pointed in a different direction. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Dude, if you&#39;re gonna be a part of the &quot;pizzagate isn&#39;t real&quot; campaign, at least pick something better than the classic &quot;it&#39;s a psyop! distraction&quot; bit...</p>

<p>There is too much quality evidence out there for you to convince any rational person out there that pizzagate isn&#39;t real, so the &quot;It&#39;s a psyop!&quot; angle isn&#39;t going to work there. Maybe try the, &quot;This has become a witch hunt&quot; instead. That bit might be more up your alley.</p>

<p>And by the way, you&#39;re discouraging critical thinking and skepticism by telling us to stop investigating and that we are crazy. This is a conspiracy forum, who the hell says that to someone else on a conspiracy forum? Shouldn&#39;t we encourage this investigation, not brush it off? You are in the minority of people on this board in regard to pizzagate.</p>

<p>Good luck.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What made me believe in pisagate was this video that was posted on youtube. Its back from 2007 I believe. Some dude working in the insurance industry stood across the street from comet ping pong and placed his camera on the ground and filmed two people playing ping pong outside of coment, trying to figure out liability issues like who would be responsible if the ball hit a car or something. If you turn up the volume in that video you could hear kids screaming &quot;help me&quot; &quot;im down here&quot; &quot;heeelllpp&quot;. This is a youtube video that was uploaded in 2007 and also has a caption in video stating the date, 2007, so this was before this pisagate thing blew up. They say that cometpingpong has an underground system of tunnels where they have the kids and do their pedo shit so to me this video gave more evidence of it possibly being 100% real. If i can find the video ill post it, should have saved it before :( </p>

<p>I&#39;m a fan of the X-Files, as are alot of other people probably,  and the biggest issue for Mulder and Scully was finding the hard evidence before Smoking Man or the Syndicate or Krycek got to it first. All of their paranormal experiences, alien encounters, conspiracy leads from members of higher levels of govt,  didn&#39;t mean anything without the actual <em>hard evidence</em>, the scientific mathematical, biological proof (of an alien virus or dna for example). </p>

<p>And the people behind those conspiracies got to the smoking gun first using tactics that included murder,  spying, discrediting,  distracting,  etc. </p>

<p><em>Why is it so absurd to think that these people are making it impossible for us to find that smoking gun?  Especially since they have the power,  the influence, the connections, the money, the tools, the necessity and determination and fear (of not being exposed).</em></p>

<p>Web sleuths then found an interview with the pizza place owner from a much earlier date stating that <strong>his tomatoes are homegrown,  in the basement of his establishment.</strong></p>

    <div class="md"><p>While it is circumstantial, it is a large amount of circumstantial evidence. The fact that it is met with such fierce opposition suggests there is something larger at play. What is happening now and what has been happening has been an obvious cover up. If they had an explanation, they would have come out with it. However, they continue to deflect, dodge, and ignore any evidence pertaining to this. I mean here&#39;s a block in D.C. with a majority of the businesses having FBI recognized pedophilia related symbols, it was a <em>gift</em> involving Saudi groups, and it implicates government officials. It all seems pretty fitting of a conspiracy theory. But if you bring it up, there is a large group who completely dismiss it and argue that it should not be discussed. I just think everyone should be open minded and look at any possibility. And look at the possible <em>reasons</em> the elites have for doing what they do.</p>
