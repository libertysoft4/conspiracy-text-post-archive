A documentary <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY-F5JoHoho">&#39;conspiracy of silence&#39;</a> had been suppressed.

His wife, Michelle Martin, was convicted as an accomplice. Dutroux was also convicted of having killed a suspected former accomplice, Bernard Weinstein. He was arrested in 1996 and has been in prison ever since, though he briefly escaped in April 1998.&quot;  Dutroux was arrested for kidnapping and raping five girls and severed an exceedingly short sentence and released on parole with government pension.  He used sleeping pills he received from his psychiatrist on his further victims in a pornographic rape dungeon with assistance from his wife and at least one other accomplice; starving their victims to death and burying their bodies in a garden.  He was again arrested for six months while his wife managed the rape dungeon.  He was arrested a third time with his wife and accomplice Lelievre, and police found the victims&#39; bodies including former accomplish Wittingstein, and a huge stash of pornographic videos.  A total of 4 conspirators and 7 victims in this sex/murder ring, but questions were asked about the Belgian Justice system with respect to how investigations were botched in allowing this to happen, though the conclusions drawn were that Dutroux benefitted from corruption, sloppiness and incompetence.<sup><sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marc_Dutroux#Parliamentary_investigation_and_escape_from_custody">[1]</a></sup></sup></li>

In November 2014, they were convicted of offences including rape, paying a child for sex, causing or inciting child prostitution, sexual acts with children and sex trafficking. As in the Oxford, Derby, Rochdale, Rotherham and Telford prosecutions, the abused girls were almost all white and the gang were of Muslim heritage, but were Somali rather than Pakistani. Some were drug-dealers selling heroin and cocaine, while others were described as &quot;well-educated men with good prospects&quot;.  The gang coerced the girls into sex with small payments of money, gifts of drugs and alcohol, and by persuading them that having sex with many men was part of &quot;Somali &#39;culture and tradition&#39;&quot;.

Several prominent British men were alleged to have attended the Guest House, including former government ministers, senior MPs, top police officers, judges, pop music stars, and people with links to the Royal Households.

    <div class="md"><p>Btw, in pulling this together, I noticed an emerging theme.  It&#39;s that many of these UK sex abuse cases were by gangs of affluent british-pakistani men with underage girls, engaged not just in molestation/rape but drugging, drug abusing/dealing, prostitution, rape-torture, slaying and acts of mind control and cultism.  Literally a criminal mafia of the worst sort of abuses. They were allowed to flourish because of political correctness leading to investigative and legislative policies that inhibited racial profiling. Even though, fuck, was it ever warranted to racially profile g d pakistanis if you look at what all this very specific group did.</p>

<p>And the other type of pedo network involved both underage girls and boys and were perpetrated by Catholics/Clergy, Football / sports coaches, entertainers, british intelligence, police and high level politicians / gentry.  You know, the usual suspects.  And less than 10 females involved in the above, with the exception of the Yewtree findings which ... no one can know how vast that network is, but that it <em>most certainly</em> <strong><em>is</em></strong> <em>vast</em>.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I didn&#39;t check all your posts real careful but I didn&#39;t notice the Pedoahile Information Exchange 1974 to 1984. Among its members was Peter Hayman second in command at MI6. Caught with pornagraphic pedo material he wasn&#39;t prosecuted because it could be used as blackmail against him( which makes no damn sense) and that he wasn&#39;t an &quot;executive&quot; board member of PIE. Also that the child porn found wasn&#39;t radical enough, whatever the fuck that means. 5 members of the board were prosecuted though.  <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paedophile_Information_Exchange">https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paedophile_Information_Exchange</a>.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Glad I could help. There&#39;s an Australian 60 minutes piece on you tube that talks about the case and one of the victims absolutely identifies Hayman. There is also a horrifying interview with a PIE member justifying consensual sex with a ten year old. He claims the only trauma to the kids is the authorities calling it wrong. The scary part is most of these guys don&#39;t even think what they are doing is wrong.  <a href="https://youtu.be/KRObgttIyeg">https://youtu.be/KRObgttIyeg</a> There ya go.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Right but there was no arrest so we can&#39;t include that one....still many believe he absolutely was involved.  I don&#39;t see how he coudln&#39;t be.  People don&#39;t spend that much time and energy (and money) draggging their children through the trauma of bringing false accusations against a powerful person like that, knowing they are connected with intelligence and miltary and other satanic networks....knowing there will be consequences.  You don&#39;t start fights with powerful people in order to lose.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It might also be fruitful to look into Kevin Annett&#39;s research. He seems like a crackpot on the surface, but he has a lot of information about the past pope, the current pope, and their ma fia ties (&#39;n d r a n g h e t a and c o m o r r a), as well as human traff icking in the past and present day in Canada.</p>

<p>Knowing this connection pieces together everything that RomeRules talks about.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s what I thought too!!!  Wow.  As I was writing it, I was like...hmm these fellows seem like scapegoats.  But then I crossreferenced and looked at witness testimonies and no these guys are bad dudes.  <em>Also.</em></p>

<p>BUt that doesn&#39;t mean that there aren&#39;t Saviles, in fact these sloppy mafiosos are just helping the hellfire white freemasons rape kids and drink their blood that much harder.  in other words, they are useful. Maybe that&#39;s why they want to import syrians....more human shields to scapegoat criminality</p>
