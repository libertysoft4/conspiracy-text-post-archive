        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Below is a timeline of the tweets/articles I gathered yesterday. I have converted the times on this post to EST which is what Washington DC uses. Twitter displays in PST and archive.is uses UTC.</p>

<p>To begin, alleged witness Sharif Silmi <a href="http://archive.fo/6C0Vc">said</a> he was inside CPP when the gunman entered.</p>

<p>He <a href="http://archive.fo/BOutk">confirmed</a> <a href="http://archive.fo/wF8hi">three</a> <a href="http://archive.fo/VssRV">times</a> in tweets that the man had a shotgun, he <a href="http://archive.fo/6C0Vc">confirmed</a> in a tweet that he had seen the suspect when he was asked by another Twitter user, he was the one who <a href="http://archive.fo/EwfNl">tweeted</a> the picture of the gunman surrendering to police, he was one of the <a href="http://archive.fo/BOutk">first</a> to start tweeting about the incident, and he never said anything about an assault rifle.</p>

<p>He also tweeted later on that he was one of the last three people out of CPP and he said they did not see or hear any shots fired. &quot;That is shocking devel.&quot; he <a href="http://archive.fo/3PQeB">said</a> at 9:05 PM EST in response to Abby D. Phillip, who is a &quot;Washington Post Political Reporter&quot; according to her Twitter bio. Phillip had tweeted that the suspect had fired his weapon.</p>

<p>Here is a first hand witness who was in CPP during the incident and who is saying, in a tweet to Phillip, that he was one of the last three people out and yet they never saw or heard any shots. This would seem to contradict Phillip&#39;s regurgitating of the claims of police in her <a href="http://archive.fo/lflsi">tweet</a> which said, </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Just to be perfectly clear how real this was: The suspect actually fired his weapon, according to police.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Phoebe Connelly, an &quot;exec. producer/product owner&quot; for Wapo according to her bio, earlier tweeted Silmi <a href="http://archive.fo/jS9kf">asking</a> for permission to use his photos. So Wapo was clearly aware of Silmi, as they should have been.</p>

<p>Yet Phillip took no interest in Silmi&#39;s comment, at least not publicly in a tweeted response to him. To my knowledge (please correct me if I&#39;m wrong) no witnesses reported seeing or hearing any gun shots, that is all coming from police reports.</p>

<p>Debra Alfarone, a TV Anchor at WUSA9, <a href="http://archive.fo/cEReA">tweeted</a> at 4:57 PM EST that, </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Police Chief Peter Newsham says man walked into Comet Ping Pong &amp; fired into the ground - more than 1 shot.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So who exactly saw or heard these shots? Was this after everyone but the suspect had left CPP? He shot the ground for no reason? And no one outside the building was within ear shot?</p>

<p>And what kind of gun did he have? Silmi clearly confirms multiple times that it was a shotgun, and he confirms that he did indeed make visual contact with the suspect.</p>

<p>Another individual, Kent Hoshiko, <a href="http://archive.fo/VBidp">tweeted</a> that he was hiding in the Red Fox coffee shop next door, and also that he heard no shots. He <a href="http://archive.fo/6U2TQ">stated</a> that he was about to head into CPP prior to the incident, indicating that he was never inside CPP when the events began. And he <a href="http://archive.fo/B5r4A">said</a> that CPP employees and customers came over to his location in Red Fox after everyone left CPP, and that CPP employees <a href="http://archive.fo/sHuYl">told</a> him that the man exiting CPP with his hands on his head was the guy who entered with the gun, indicating that Hoshiko never saw the man with the gun originally.</p>

<p>Hoshiko did <a href="http://archive.fo/B5r4A">say</a> that the man was carrying, &quot;what appeared to be an assault rifle&quot; but that was directly after saying CPP employees and customers had come over to Red Fox. So it seems that this was based off of second hand reports from unidentified witnesses.</p>

<p>Have any witnesses been identified who have reported seeing a rifle? </p>

<p>Gareth Wade, a Washington resident who was inside CPP, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/obama-administration-placed-children-with-human-traffickers-report-says/2016/01/28/39465050-c542-11e5-9693-933a4d31bcc8_story.html?utm_term=.8a9f3b574c84">said</a> to the Washington Post, </p>

<blockquote>
<p>The servers came up to us and said, uh, a man had just walked into the building past us into the back of the building, he seems to have, like, a shotgun or a rifle type of thing, um, and said we ought to vacate the buildings. So we walked out the front of the building, um, took our pizzas and our beer. [laughing]</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Wade makes it sound as though it was the servers who told him about the suspect and the shotgun/rifle, neither he nor his friend made any indication that they had visual contact with the armed suspect (and of course idiot Wapo doesn&#39;t bother to ask basic fucking questions).</p>

<p>In addition, Silmi <a href="http://archive.fo/VssRV">tweeted</a>, &quot;I think he was trying to stash the shotgun in the back to use later on,&quot; Hoshiko <a href="http://archive.fo/fhnCX">tweeted</a>, &quot;employees said he walked past everyone towards the back of the restaurant,&quot; and Wade <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/obama-administration-placed-children-with-human-traffickers-report-says/2016/01/28/39465050-c542-11e5-9693-933a4d31bcc8_story.html?utm_term=.8a9f3b574c84">said</a>, &quot;a man had just walked into the building past us into the back of the building.&quot; What exactly was he doing trying to get to the back? What kind of interaction did he have with anyone before heading towards that location?</p>

<p>Benjamin Freed and Jessica Sidman of the Washingtonian <a href="http://archive.fo/oFkJc">wrote</a>, </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Acting DC Police Chief Peter Newsham told reporters Sunday evening that Welch walked into Comet Ping Pong and did fire at least one shot into the ground. Police added that the Welch&#39;s car is registered in North Carolina.</p>

<p>Welch made no vocal threats or demands during the incident inside Comet Ping Pong, police say.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What? So he made no verbal threats or demands (<a href="https://www.washingtonian.com/2016/12/04/man-with-rifle-arrested-at-comet-ping-pong/">these two paragraphs are still in the article as of now</a>), he just made a non-verbal threat of firing into the ground at some point, which no one heard or saw, and then the police just reported the shots at a later time? How exactly do &quot;journalists&quot; string these two paragraphs together without any clarification??</p>

<p>The official police report <a href="http://archive.fo/JlfiX">released</a> on the 5th, which, naturally, is extremely vague, says Welch pointed a firearm at an employee who fled and then called the police. Then Welch, &quot;proceeded to discharge the rifle inside of the establishment.&quot; Two firearms were recovered from inside the location and an additional weapon was retrieved from Welch&#39;s vehicle, according to the report.</p>

<p>Everyone but the police, and apparently one employee who they interviewed, keeps asserting that the suspect just walked towards the back without saying anything. The Washingtonian article also stated,</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Matt Carr owns Little Red Fox, a cafe and coffeeshop next door to Comet. Carr was making sandwiches when a couple of Comet Ping Pong waiters rushed in his cafe and market and told him to lock the doors.</p>

<p>They&#39;d seen the man with a gun blow past the host stand and head to the back of the restaurant. He didn&#39;t say a word to anyone from what they could tell.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Did he do a silent drive-by pointing of the firearm as he tip-toed full steam towards the back? Then he placed a silencer on the assault rifle and shot the floor a few times after patiently waiting for everyone to get completely out of ear shot?</p>

<p>A Washington Post article <a href="http://archive.fo/t7PUP">published</a> at 8:07 AM EST on December 5th provided much needed clarification on these obvious questions, </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Police said Welch proceeded to discharge the rifle inside the restaurant; they think that all other occupants had fled when Welch began shooting.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>They think? How about you fucking ask them? They don&#39;t know? Did they interview any witnesses at any point?</p>

<p>The article continued,</p>

<blockquote>
<p>A D.C. police report made public Monday says Welch had been armed with an AR-15 assault-style rifle. The report also says police seized a Colt .38 caliber handgun and a shotgun. One of those weapons was found inside the restaurant; the other in the suspect&#39;s car. Police did not specify the locations.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The Metropolitan PD provided documents later <a href="https://www.scribd.com/document/333293577/Comet-Gunman-Incident-Report#from_embed">published</a> by the Washingtonian which contained the seven charges against Welch: assault with a dangerous weapon, carrying a pistol without a license (outside home or place of business), unlawful possession of ammunition, unlawful discharge of a firearm, possession of an unregistered firearm/unlawful possession of a firearm or destructive device, possession of a large capacity ammunition feeding device, and destruction of property $1,000 or more.</p>

<p>The assault with a dangerous weapon charge lists &quot;handgun, shotgun, rifle&quot; and alleges that the assault occurred inside the restaurant.</p>

<p>The carrying a pistol without a license charge does not list a weapon (I suppose it&#39;s presumed to be the handgun), and alleges that this occurred inside the restaurant.</p>

<p>The unlawful possession of ammunition charge lists &quot;handgun, shotgun, rifle&quot; and alleges that this occurred inside the restaurant.</p>

<p>The unlawful discharge of a firearm  charge lists &quot;handgun, shotgun, rifle&quot; and alleges that this occurred inside the restaurant.</p>

<p>The possession of an unregistered firearm charge lists &quot;handgun, shotgun, rifle&quot; and alleges that this occurred inside the restaurant.</p>

<p>The possession of a large capacity ammunition feeding device charge lists &quot;handgun, shotgun, rifle&quot; and alleges that this occurred inside the restaurant.</p>

<p>And the destruction of property charge is presumably related to the items listed below all of the charges, which includes a door, door lock, computer tower, and barrier wall.</p>

<p>Also listed are a Colt AR-15, Colt .38 handgun, a shotgun &quot;unknown or unlisted,&quot; and a folding knife, among other miscellaneous items. The report did not specify where the weapons were recovered.</p>

<p>If Welch had the handgun inside the restaurant as the &quot;carrying a pistol without a license&quot; charge indicates, and Welch also had a shotgun and a rifle inside the restaurant, as indicated by the other charges as well as Silmi&#39;s witness report and Hoshiko&#39;s second hand witness report, then what gun could have possibly been in the car?</p>

<p>Why didn&#39;t Silmi report seeing any rifle? How did Welch carry both a shotgun and a rifle into the restaurant, did he have one strapped onto his back? Why didn&#39;t anyone report seeing him carrying two guns? If either the shotgun or the rifle were left in the car then why did different witnesses apparently see both at various times?</p>

<p>The media reports have been repeatedly asserting that Welch stormed into the restaurant with an &quot;assault rifle&quot; yet the most outspoken and clear witness who was there, who was also allegedly one of the last to leave, never reported seeing any rifle, and confirmed multiple times that the suspect had a shotgun. Did Welch have the AR-15 shoved up his ass?</p>

<p>The very objective press release published on the DC government website from Metropolitan PD made sure to round it off with,</p>

<blockquote>
<p>During a post arrest interview this evening, the suspect revealed that he came to the establishment to self-investigate &quot;Pizza Gate&quot; (a fictitious online conspiracy theory).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Thank you for giving us your esteemed opinion about the veracity of an online conspiracy theory, next time just fill out the fucking paperwork. To their credit though, they did respond with almost unbelievable speed.</p>

<p>The aforementioned <a href="http://archive.fo/oFkJc">Washingtonian piece</a> says that Little Red Fox owner Matt Carr &quot;saw at least seven to nine police cars swarm the restaurant&quot; within two to three minutes. Seven to nine police cars within a few minutes?</p>

<p>CPP was <a href="http://archive.fo/pCGgL">reportedly</a> heightening its security during music shows, and police were certainly aware of the torrential downpour of death threats alleged by Alefantis, but still seven to nine or more police vehicles within minutes is quite extraordinary. It&#39;s almost as if they were somehow tipped off beforehand.</p>

<p>Hilariously, various DC media personnel have been publishing tweets indiscriminately ridiculing the undifferentiated mass of &quot;conspiracy theorists,&quot; whom they refer to as &quot;<a href="http://archive.fo/i2B0F">mouth-breathers</a>,&quot; because some might suspect that Welch and others were part of a &quot;false flag op.&quot;</p>

<p>Here&#39;s a thought: maybe do your fucking jobs and learn how to write a fucking article. This would typically include such ground breaking methods as asking witnesses, &quot;what did you see?&quot;</p>

<p>Also helpful would be attempting to stitch together the evidence into a clear coherent picture so people can actually understand what the fuck happened. If there are seeming contradictions then attempting to gain further clarification with witnesses and police would probably go a long way in minimizing any confusion.</p>

<p>What the media does not understand, or refuses to understand, is that not every &quot;conspiracy theorist&quot; will be a proponent of a particular theory no matter what. Given ample evidence they might adjust their position. Many conspiracy theorists are critical thinkers who have simply committed the deadly sin of not blindly accepting incoherent contradictions even when those contradictions come from a place of supposed authority or from those operating under the pretense of &quot;investigative journalism&quot; (puke).</p>

<p>The mainstream media, until its dying breath (and it is dying), will maintain at all costs that us &quot;mouth-breathers&quot; have no justification for being suspicious towards them. Yet it&#39;s obvious that a large portion of that suspicion is driven by their embarrassing levels of incompetence and all out refusal to investigate those whom they rub elbows with, lest they lose their precious press access and invites to cocktail parties.</p>

<p>Rather than accept any responsibility it&#39;s simply easier to act like buffoons and point the finger at their supposed political enemies (even though not everyone interested in pizzagate, such as myself, is a Donald Trump supporter).</p>

<p>TL;DR; All the reports are still in conflict and the mainstream media is filled with 2nd graders</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is the kind of thing we should all hope to see.  This is what I&#39;m talking about when it comes to the bigger picture.  It took one person and a few hours of work and now we are a little closer to understanding.  It took a few hours and now this gent can take a much needed break and feel he has contributed.  </p>

<p>How many people could contribute 4 hours of work to help bring down a cabal of out of control criminals?  I know in my heart that it wouldn&#39;t take many people putting in their &quot;4 hours&quot; to put some serious pressure on these sorts of people.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Some very good analysis with some good data. I would encourage you to expand your timeline of events. For example:</p>

<p>Dec 2 - CPP Announces they have beefed up security</p>

<p>Dec 2 - a major Bill passed in the House, and Podesta was (allegedly) spotted in the office of the bill sponsor. </p>

<p>Dec 3 - Allegations of a traffic cam redirect emerge</p>

<p>Dec 4 - Maddy case receives a shot in the arm with an announcement of funding to resume the investigation</p>

<p>Dec 4 - CPP Shooter quickly proves to be an actor</p>

<p><strong>QUESTIONS</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Was Podesta in cahoots with </li>
<li>What security company did CPP hire?</li>
<li>Was the security company local, or global in reach?</li>
<li>Was the security company comprised of uniformed officers, or plain clothes, or both?</li>
<li>Is there any correlation or relationships between the cast of The Bleeding, and anyone in DC?</li>
<li>Edgar Welch had a DUI October 25th, how does that fit in?</li>

<p>What about Welch&#39;s father:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Harry Welch Jr. is a former police officer, firearms instructor and expert witness on firearms, according to his IMDB profile. He also writes that his family has hosted foster children and has worked to prevent child abuse.</p>

<p>He was, &quot;elected President of the North Carolina Crime Stoppers Association (two terms). Served as Executive Director for Protect-A-Child, a national, non-profit organization to prevent abuse and abduction of children. Appointed by Governor Jim Martin to the Governor’s Commission on Child Victimization.&quot;</p>

&quot;In 1990, I was invited by the US Defense Department to go to Europe and watch war games with joint forces of the US Army and our allies in West Germany.
In 1988, President Ronald Reagan selected me to join 15 other broadcasters to visit US Military Instillations in Colorado. We received national clearance from the US Defense Department to visit the Cheyenne Mountain Nuclear Bunker the alternate command center for NORAD.&quot;</p>
