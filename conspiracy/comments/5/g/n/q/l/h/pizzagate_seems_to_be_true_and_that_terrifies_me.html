<p>People are being exposed to pizza gate, even in this sub at just a layers worth of evidence. It&#39;s so deep that it scares me. We&#39;re literally living in a propagated world that&#39;s been going on for much longer than anyone can trace their ancestry. </p>

<p>Crazy shit. Our freedom of speech will be fought for. I feel like that is the last straw after a NWO/Corporatist take over attempt of our basic human rights to speak freely before we see a civll war.</p>

<p>As long as the soldiers aren&#39;t brainwashed and can see the evidence of everything we can be connected to (being the internet and communities like this) won&#39;t attack their neighbor. Hopefully. </p>

<p>I&#39;m with you. I&#39;ve delved too deep into this rabbit hole that I think it will forever affect my career/family prospectives. </p>

<p>Honestly at this point. I really wish a alien take over of the Antarctic continent comes down and just tells all of us we&#39;re their ants to their world.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I first heard about some woman who was found dead in Haiti when investigating a child trafficking ring related to pizzagate. Then I checked /pol/ on 4Chan and the whole thing was blowing the hell up right there. Since then /pol/ is flooded with shills and disinformation agents shitposting all day. There is so much information, so many pictures and infographics floating around, but yet still people who only read a headline on Facebook without having looked into the matter continue to commit ad hominem and burden of proof. It makes me cynical that people like these exist and it makes me think that stupid people deserve what they get. But seeing some people still thinking rationally like you guys gives me hope to not give up and try to be of significance in this time in history. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>In the past when I&#39;ve read sentiments such as this, I did dismiss the whole scandal as outlandish. How could it really be that serious of a situation?</p>

<p>However, as you say, watching this from the very beginning, a month before there was a &quot;gate,&quot; but just a smattering of inquiries, I can say that I believe similarly as you do.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve even gone through phases of disbelief, and reading articles from skeptics that give an honest critique to the circumstantial evidence of child trafficking and/or impunity of child trafficking by our government. </p>

<p>I haven&#39;t drawn any hard and fast conclusions besides that this needs to be taken seriously and continually questioned. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That makes at least three of us, and I know there are tens of thousands more. It&#39;s not going away any time soon, and the MSM is doing whatever it can to hold on to their last bit of power - along with trying to sweep it all under the rug for their bosses.</p>

<p>Gonna be interesting to see how it all plays out. We&#39;re already starting to see a bit of it come out on shows like the Joe Rogan podcast, and regular people are starting to ask the questions.</p>

<p>I was skeptical at first, but they kept finding threads to pull on, and from those even more threads. It&#39;s been <em>several</em> weeks since this has all started, and they&#39;re <em>still</em> finding these threads. </p>

<p>Does anyone have a solid timeline of events from the start? Like all of it including the Twittergate stuff, and banning the subreddit, and Alefantis coming out and stating it was fake for the first time... the poor girl dying in Haiti...? I&#39;ve barely stopped by Voat... I suppose that&#39;s where all the action is, eh? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree. It&#39;s too bad some of us can&#39;t meet up. I would love to talk to some of you guys in person, because this stuff is legitimately traumatizing and I could use some fucking mental/emotional support. maybe I&#39;m spending too much time on here? It&#39;s become an obsession...</p>

<p>Did any of you guys check out voat a few days ago? The &quot;Coloboma&quot; condition that Maddie Mccann has affecting her eye? And all of the different globalists who also had the condition? There is something significant about that condition, this &quot;PAX2&quot; gene that could potentially rebuild cells and reverse the aging process. These elite may be seeking the blood from young people with this condition to rejuvinate and revitalize themselves. Just a theory, but when I read that, I had to take a step back...I felt weird for hours after. Hell, I still do. It was absolutely traumatic.</p>

<p>I&#39;m here if anyone wants to talk or bullshit about how this stuff has affected them. This stuff can fuck with you, man...</p>

<p>Keep at it though.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It is traumatizing indeed. But we were born into this world and can&#39;t do too much about this except for trying our best spreading this information. If you somehow know how to affect history you could give it a shot. It will involve knowing true history, how people think and how to convince them by affecting their thinking process. PSYCHOLOGY is the tool they use against the people (media), and it could be a tool we can use too. People in general nowadays don&#39;t have a long attention span. 3 to 7 seconds (online) is most of the time you have to grab someones attention before they look the other way (Clickbait? Headlines? Graphics?). </p>

<p>What did Adolf say about this again? To convince people of a big lie, keep the lie simple, repeat it continually and people will eventually believe it. Replace lie with truth and turn the lie into something other than words.</p>

<p>For the rest the best advice I could give to myself and maybe to you is just to stop focusing your thoughts on this, work hard and make the best for yourself and your loved ones, and learn as much about the true history of the world before you come to your end. I&#39;m not religious at all, but the bible has come to my attention. I&#39;m planning on reading it trying to not take everything literally but more metaphorically, like it&#39;s a story with an useful message. It is one of the oldest historical books for all I know. </p>

<p>Ironically, the <em>&quot;big lie&quot;</em> quote has itself become a &quot;big lie&quot;, with people asserting that Hitler was advocating the use of such techniques for deception. In fact he was describing how <em>others</em> had used the &quot;big lie&quot; technique to deceive the German people following WW1.</p>

<p>I had read tidbits of the Bible here and there through my life. </p>

<p>Recently I decided to read it with a critical eye, paying close attention to the unfolding of the story, beginning with Genesis 1:1.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yep, the history we are taught is filled with lies. That&#39;s a good example of the technique being used actually. Put a quote next to a person in a picture. Spread it on the internet, and people will eventually get the idea, you know, that mister fuhrer was the one who used it. How this can be so simple amazes me. 
Reminds me of the quote from Stalin or some guy, that ideas are more dangerous than guns. Inception also had a theme about ideas, that ideas can be planted or something. I&#39;m sad that I don&#39;t have enough free time to make 100% sense out all of this lol.</p>

<p>What do these institutions teach? </p>

<p>Critical thinking? No, questioning the entrenched dogma and tenets is a sure path to failure.</p>

<p>To succeed in such institutions of &quot;higher learning&quot; one must master the art of parroting whatever horseshit spews from the mouths of those who are empowered judge whether any student is &quot;fit&quot; to carry on the &quot;torch&quot; - the effervescent ego that they have embraced as &quot;themselves&quot; incorporate.</p>

<p><em>Listen carefully, think critically, and then react with wisdom and calculated fidelity - as a disarming strategy.</em></p>

<p>These are the most important lessons that children can be taught in this age. Swine have no regard for Pearls - feed them then the slop that their egos DO desire.</p>

You should read all the emails before it and become more knowledgeable about their context and maybe you&#39;ll get the reasons she said it. If I have no proof, you certainly have no proof about any of the code words so, what&#39;s your justification for believing a handful of abstract circumstantial points bound together by loose associations? Lol the absolute unwillingness to see others who disagree as human beings I&#39;d hilarious.

    <div class="md"><p>No. I have seen it from the beginning and what I see is conjecture that people have taken to be fact from the beginning. We now have Youtube videos that present the &quot;evidence&quot; as if it is fact, starting with the supposed meanings of the code words. Well, they&#39;re off to a bad start because the handkerchief code only covers &quot;white&quot; and &quot;black.&quot; All the other words (pizza, pasta, map, ice cream, hot dog, dominos, etc.) are not part of the handkerchief code. The definitions of these code words is literally the result of people in 4chan reading Podesta emails and saying, &quot;hey, if you look at it this way, it fits! And here&#39;s a picture of people eating pizza to prove it!&quot; How anyone doesn&#39;t realize this is not proof is beyond me.</p>

<p>E: And, once again, we have an anonymous coward downvoter who can not defend his want-to-believe beliefs, so he just downvotes like a baby. Provide some substantive evidence instead. Oh right, you can&#39;t. You&#39;ve already provided the best you can and it doesn&#39;t even reach the level of circumstantial evidence.</p>

Having a stance on true or false on the allegations here is irrational.

Your stance that this is absurd is as much a leap as that it is true. So why gamble if you&#39;re so sore on being right?

The fact is the reaction to pizza gate is inconspicuous and selective given that other high profile persons have been implicated in other stories/leaks, and the media remained silent.  This scenario begs me to reserve my judgement until a time comes where people can actually make a legitimate accusation. There is not a &#39;once wrong always wrong&#39; mentality that you can rationally claim when you&#39;re talking about something being uncertain or unlikely. You just don&#39;t have data. Nothing. So don&#39;t take a stance, unless you have a vested interest in burning a bridge before anyone gets close enough to cross it.  It could be a fake distraction, but that isn&#39;t something I&#39;m going to idiotically assume, especially given the way the story is being handled.

Your need to pick a side defeats any ability for you to see clearly if circumstance changes in the future. The world goes on, evidence can stack up over decades. </p>

<p>Your need to pick a side(true or false) also is inconspicuous, as well your consistent linking to things that are irrelevant to you contradicting yourself and riding a contradictory lanky horse. You know someone is full of shit when their opinion is as bland as the other side of the coin.</p>

The witch hunt was sparked by a stupidly convenient narrative. So stop acting like people weren&#39;t prompted by the media to make this a bigger deal than it could possibly have ever been given the lack of any evidence.  </p>

<p>People witch hunting doesn&#39;t change anything the about the likelihood of something. I don&#39;t care about the reputation of people I don&#39;t know. I&#39;m not going to defend a business I know nothing about just because I have a high and mighty sense of justice. That&#39;s ridiculous.</p>

<p>You are blind and have no idea, just like me, but you tend to follow some ridiculous moral compass entrenched in superficial arbitration(the law) of how data is viewed. The law in this country is a joke as it only applies to those without status and powerful connections.</p>

<p>Objectively there is no reason to take a stance here. Unless you have that much faith in the law of a country that extorts and disenfranchises it&#39;s people to favor the constant usurping of foreign governments for the benefit of very few of those who actually finance such a charade(with a lifetime of taxation and labor).</p>

<p>Your witch hunt description is your opinion, and that&#39;s all it is. I&#39;d call it gas lighting to create sensation and buzz that will justify the restrictions of our free speech, but that&#39;s just my opinion, and you won&#39;t see me claiming that it is anything more than that.</p>

<p>No one even agrees that this is what it is. The heated debate and attack of this sub didn&#39;t start until the media blitz. It is inconspicuous, and your subscription is inconspicuous.</p>

<p>Your think your opinion has ground because you trust man made institutions/the rule of law, that you have to have faith in. Just because you can cite arbitrary ways that speech is dictated and viewed AGAIN does not change the statistical likelihood of an occurrence.

<p>Edit: I don&#39;t know what&#39;s actually going on, you seem to think you do, and think your opinion on the matter is more than that; a simple and under informed opinion.</p>

Luckily for you I am not vindictive and I don&#39;t think it is empowering to dig up details about someone and post them in order to try to shut them up. Canadians and Americans alike have better things to worry about than pizza parlours, you got that much right. Strangely you still seem interested in them.

    <div class="md"><p>Personally, I firmly believe, (especially if nothing causing an arrest is ever found) this pizzagate bullshit is designed to take attention away from Wikileaks itself, the Clinton Foundation and the fact that Julian Assange is MIA.  Now that the elections are over, they must make us all forget about the corruption uncovered there.  No one even speaks of Abedin or Weiner, the missing emails, or other facts.  The Lolita Express also involves child trafficking, rape, world leaders and british royalty, eyewitnesses, a convicted billionaire, the Clinton&#39;s and girls as young as 14, and a lot of factual evidence the US media refused to cover.  Did it receive this kind of attention?  Not even remotely.  </p>

You hold your reservation for evidence that would actually give you the ability to take an informed stance. Is there a reason you want to assume that there is no chance this is real? You seem to think the accusation needs evidence, why doesn&#39;t disbelief also require evidence?  Simply because you haven&#39;t observed something means that it isn&#39;t happening?  We also are not talking about petty robbery here. The level of contention and importance to some of the most powerful people in this country is on the line.  What a coincidence, people that also historically fuck children.  Maybe the stack of coincidences should mean a little more in this context.  Maybe not, but you sure as hell don&#39;t know more either way than I do. So why are you picking a side?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Because the burden of proof is on the accuser. You don&#39;t bring a person into court for them to prove their innocence, you have to prove their guilt, beyond a reasonable doubt. Also, there isn&#39;t even slightly credible evidence in this case. I am surprised you live in the country you do and don&#39;t know what the burden of proof implies, nor the fact that people are innocent until proven guilty. You realize this also protects you from false accusations? Pizzagate is the flimsiest excuse for a conspiracy ever, and I&#39;ve seen them all come and go.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>We aren&#39;t in court, we aren&#39;t putting anyone on trial. We are surmising on what is and isn&#39;t likely. The answer to which is you don&#39;t have an idea either way. The rule of law doesn&#39;t apply here, we are not practicing law, we are unbiasedly weighing the likelihood of something. You have no evidence either way that this did or didn&#39;t happen, and I don&#39;t think anyone has made any official accusations until we were pre-empted with a bullshit gun scare at the pizza place in question. </p>

<p>Key word there, pre-empted. A little odd you get the benefit of reasonable doubt now that it is being addressed poorly by the media. Before this was all theory crafting, and it still is, because no one has anything. There is no talk of reasonable doubt until there has been an official accusation, and now you have the benefit of a poor one that conveniently happened early, and didn&#39;t give any time  for evidence to stack up. Your argument relies on the convenient timing of the unusually quick response to a fairly new and wild conspiracy on the net. </p>

<p>Hmm, I think you can shove your rule of law here. There will be a reasonable accusation and it will take time to build, you don&#39;t get to dismiss this out of the notion that some guy shooting off a gun in a pizza joint is grounds for an official accusation. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, you definitely aren&#39;t putting anyone on trial with your evidence, my point exactly. And yes, there is no accusation, you don&#39;t even have enough to do that. Go ahead, bluster on, you already fucked us all over with your complete lack of understanding and critical thought. You cannot provide one single credible shred of evidence. You are chasing a fairy tale made up by trolls and spooks. It would be funny if it didn&#39;t impact the rest of us so severely. You fell into this by tripping over an infographic and now you don&#39;t know up from down. It is a joke. Any rational person looks at this and can immediately dismiss it as fantasy and delusion because there is NO EVIDENCE. The fact you would even argue about it without being able to provide even the slightest thing beyond fake codewords and instagram posts is shameful. You should be ashamed. Add to it that you think baseless accusations are fine and that the burden of proof is on the accused shows just how disconnected and self-centered your world is.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was never offering evidence, I pointed out you had a stance even though there is no evidence. Taking a stance requires knowledge, none of which you have.  So your stance on &quot;wrong&quot; isn&#39;t exactly rational. You have no evidence either way.  Burden of proof is only relevant in the rule of law, why are you getting defensive. Mathematically there is no reason to take a stance either way, but you have one. Wonder why you feel compelled to gamble if you know there&#39;s nothing to base your stance on.</p>

<p>Edit: you are putting words in my mouth. I only argued neither party is substantiated enough to make such a determination as true or false. I have no reason to be ashamed at the oddity of your subscription to an answer you have no data to determine.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I wasn&#39;t commenting on what you say you did or know, I was commenting about your claim that there needs to be evidence to substantiate a poor accusation(that no one was really making yet to begin with) that the media poorly and quickly put in front of us after the story gained a little traction on the web. Odd this story out of all the things on this sub gets representation on the media suddenly. Not the only high profile persons recently implicated recently, but now this story is in the news? Just an observation there. </p>

<p>Needless to say, you&#39;re not putting forth any evidence that proves pizza gate is completely fake, while saying evidence needs to be present to say it did happen.  Kind of not following your own advice right now are you? If you applied the logic you&#39;ve been applying this whole time to your most recent reply you&#39;d be giving yourself quite the hard time.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s not that i specifically don&#39;t think it&#39;s true, it&#39;s that the evidence being promoted shows faulty logic and leaps.  it isn&#39;t following a trail of evidence to a logical conclusion, it&#39;s creating a theory and trying to create a story around it with random connections.</p>

<p>One example is the name of the lawyer found on the Besta incorporation docs is a common-ass name that happens to be shared by someone who works for the DOJ.  It&#39;s not the same person and there was no reason to believe it was except that people really wanted to believe that it was.</p>

<p>There is nothing linking the child trafficking in haiti with the pizza shops, except some of the same people like to visit both of those places.  That&#39;s an egregiously loose connection.</p>

<p>That said, child trafficking DOES exist and pedophilia IS used as a tool.  They don&#39;t call the greek man/ boy &quot;intercrural&quot; relationship &quot;oxford style&quot; for nothing.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well I have never accused you of being &quot;a paid shill&quot; but it is a real thing.  If nothing else there are lots of people who like to argue for whatever reason and are completely exhausting because their minds are closed.

<p>I&#39;m just a person who has come to understand that we live in a Nation that controls our perception of reality and one of the ways they do that is through media and propaganda.   It sounds absurd and crazy because it is absurd and crazy but it&#39;s also true.  This is where a &quot;shill&quot; would ask me where&#39;s the proof, as though I might have an audio recording or signed confession from the government rather than a lifetime of learning and education that gives me the ability to think for myself and decide what things really mean. </p>

<p>So no, I&#39;m not actually a paranoid schizophrenic  character in a hollywood movie thinking everyone who has a different point of view/belief/knowledge base is trying to lie to me about some ultimate truth. </p>

<p>Over the years I&#39;ve learned how to identify a human who has different opinion from me but is opened minded or wants to learn, someone who is approaching the conversation wanting to try to understand a different point of view, like you, and someone who is shut down and gets defensive when you talk about your ideas, just wants to make you feel like a crazy idiot.   It&#39;s important for your sanity to be able to distinguish between the two.  </p>

<p>The opinion that pizzagate is not true?  Yeah of course it&#39;s completely possible this is just hysteria and totally made up weird &quot;fake news&quot; blowing up due to the obsession of bunch of paranoid delusional schizophrenics on the internet.  It&#39;s not like that&#39;s never happened before. </p>

<p>But on the other hand, it&#39;s not like there haven&#39;t been many pedophile rings busted with members of governments, hollywood/music industry, the church - our most powerful social institutions.  It&#39;s not even that rare? Do you think that people at first accepted the reality that the Catholic church is filled with pedophiles that have molested thousands, likely millions, at least 850 priests were defrocked, and the church officials knew abut it and covered it up with the help from members of our judicial system? Is that really more believable than this pizza shit?  Does that prove pizzagate, no of course not but it does prove that it&#39;s completely possible, these things are real and we have many examples, and it would be crazy and irrational to immediately dismiss it and say &quot;this is debunked&quot;. </p>

<p>Yeah this is the biggest problem right here. They&#39;re looking at the most absurd aspect of it and immediately writing the whole thing off. Not a single person has followed up the Laura Silsby thing with a &quot;huh, what do you mean that a convicted child trafficker works alongside the Amber Alert program?&quot;... they&#39;ve all said &quot;Well what does that have to do with Satan?&quot;</p>

<p>Why do you think that this works this way?  Are you really not familiar at all with any previous cases of child sex abuse and pedophile rings?  The parents don&#39;t just show up and come forward, making weepy tearful confessions in front of courthouses on CNN, this isn&#39;t actually the movies. </p>

<p>There is so much shame and humiliation involved for the victims of sexual abuse.  It can takes years for people to even recover their memories of the traumatic event if it was severe enough and years for people to come forward if ever.  Every time a victim comes forward in every highly publicized case of sexual assault the victim is dragged through the mud.  Who would want to put themselves through that, talk about something horrible and shameful that happened to them only to be told by thousands of people they are just liars, just in it for the pay etc.  It just doesn&#39;t work the way you are saying it does and you can go read the decades of research on sexual abuse to help you understand why there wouldn&#39;t be any victims or witnesses coming forward. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>There&#39;s no proof that pizzagate is real, nor is there necessarily one definitive theory as to what pizzagate entails, if true.  I followed it from almost the beginning, and saw all of the speculations that developed.  It started with the curious Podesta e-mails, which led people to dig further and discover James Alefantis, Comet Ping Pong, Heavy Breathing etc.</p>

<p>For me, the most &quot;damning&quot; evidence is that there is an adult male who runs a family friendly pizza restaurant, yet has a bunch of Instagram photos of babies and young children, with questionable comments (like &quot;hotard&quot;).  It&#39;s also curious that a friend of the restaurant, according to his website, is the band Heavy Breathing, which really seems to have some pedophiliac innuendo.  There&#39;s also the artist of Comet Ping Pong who has other works that heavily contain innuendo.  There&#39;s a lot more curiosities, but I&#39;m trying to keep this brief.</p>

<p>This isn&#39;t proof of an underground pedophile ring, but these people don&#39;t seem normal (and I don&#39;t just mean eccentric), and I wouldn&#39;t trust the fuckers with my kids, that&#39;s for sure.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Exactly. And yet you got downvoted even though your comment is the logical perspective and asserts the same issues I had with what I saw (ie. some of the Instagram stuff), particularly the #hotard one. You didn&#39;t really give the Comet Pizza guys a pass, yet they angry irrational mob is yelling &quot;you didn&#39;t go far enough! Burn the witch!&quot;</p>

<p>However, check this out: someone in another thread pointed out to me that hotard is one of the guys nicknames. That makes sense. But, see how when you view it through pizzagate glasses it all looks weird. </p>

<p>It&#39;s a hipster pizza joint catering to an artsy crowd and viewed through that lens, there is nothing all that weird on the Instagram account at all, really. Same kind of weird shit gets posted on social media for NYC bars; the only difference is most NY bars are not targeting hipster parents, so there isn&#39;t a lot of pictures of children, too.</p>

<p>In these emails, you will find that the Government of Haiti was denying the release of Laura Silsby based on their judicial process on behalf of Haitian parents that were claiming their children were being kidnapped by Silsby.

Just know that sometimes belief becomes worse. Like the planned parenthood shooting in Colorado, for example. Belief based on logic that was flawed and lies became action and dead people. My thinking is that my belief is in innocent until SUSPECTED IDEAS ARE PROVEN. And this situation was never about proof, and more and more it seems like a witch hunt</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Which image is supposed to show me as a liar, exactly?</p>

<p>The sexual imagery is separate from the child pictures. The rest are people jumping to conclusions about comments like #chickenlover and #hotard. Turns out #hotard was just one of the guys&#39; nicknames at Comet Pizza and I&#39;m sure #chickenlover could just as easily refer to something else besides an obscure pedo term.</p>

<p>It&#39;s a hipster rock n&#39; roll place featuring bands. Subversive themes are totally par for the course. The parents are the only ones going to that Instagram and obviously they weren&#39;t freaked out by it. If you think the whole community is bringing their kids there to be violated, you&#39;re stupid.</p>

<p>There are several Instagram photos were people write &quot;creepy&quot; such as this one: <a href="https://i.sli.mg/TQiNnO.png">https://i.sli.mg/TQiNnO.png</a> ...notice it says &quot;creepy, metal,&quot; etc. That is obviously a joke. People do joke about such things. Especially subversive rock n&#39; rollers. If you don&#39;t understand why that would be funny, you&#39;re a sheltered baby. Live in NYC for a while and actually <em>go outside</em> for a change.</p>

<p>As I said, there are clearly pedophiles connected with the Clintons, but pizzagate is 99% bullshit and even Alex Jones says so. Watch right here:</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Because there&#39;s plenty of real conspiracy and this pizzagate bullshit is taking over and making the conspiracy theory community look even dumber than it already looked. You know it was started by Trumpeters and that Trump has a child rape trial starting this month, right? You have no concept of research or evidence because 99% of Pizzagate is complete bullshit and you&#39;ve sunk your time into it like it&#39;s going somewhere. Where it is likely going is a defamation lawsuit against several websites and possibly some Youtubers. That&#39;s where it&#39;s going.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I love listening to and reading about conspiracy theories. Mostly because I think it&#39;s entertaining, not because I actually believe them. My sister was in a school shooting labeled as a &quot;false-flag&quot; and I had listened to her complain about a certain student(the shooter) for weeks beforehand. This sub specifically was claiming it was a hoax, when I knew for a fact it wasn&#39;t. That really turned me off of anything with that label. </p>

<p>Then came the election.</p>

<p>I&#39;m pretty sure this is my first conspiracy theory that really changed my mind and flipped a lot of my politics on its head. It&#39;s been really uncomfortable to come to the same conclusion you came to. While we can&#39;t exactly know the entire truth, I do know that SOMETHING SHADY IS UP. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>So I can only speak for me but when the Orlando shooting at that night club happened, I happened to be watching CNN for the first time in years.  I couldn&#39;t believe my eyes, everything about it seemed off and wrong and it was clear to me Anderson Cooper and Don Lemon, at the very least, were nothing more than bad actors.  </p>

<p>I had never been a real conspiracy theory person, I was open minded about the 9-11 truther stuff but I didn&#39;t have strong feelings about it like &quot;eh yeah well it wouldn&#39;t surprise me.&quot;   But seeing news footage being faked was like holy shit, what is this??   When I talked about not being able to believe the news coverage, that it appeared to be completely faked, people would accuse me of saying the actual shooting event wasn&#39;t real even though that&#39;s not what I said or even thought at all.  </p>

<p>is it really so wrong if i just give in to it and join this movement to create this new world. there is order, sanity, peace, safety. </p>

<p>if life can be depicted as as if we are pigs being readied for the slaughter house, what is the use of these so called awakened pigs that say we are going ot get slaughtered when our fate is really sealed anyway. do you want to spend the rest of your life knowing you will be turned into bacon or just be in the bliss of the inevitable.</p>

<p>some pigs might try to cause a ruckus and break through the fences but get real, they will just be shot down if ever or brought back. and what else, they tighten up our cage even more for the others. what good does it make.</p>

<p>because it is like so in reality isnt it? is your common man not equal to a pig that is against the farmer? and this is not new, how old is the idea that we are really just livestock, cash cows. if anything the only real way for you to possibly hurt the farmer is to kill yourselves en masse so the farmer loses all of his profit for this season. but even then, he&#39;ll just get some new pigs from elsewhere, breed them and hes back to where he left off.</p>

And, more on the right than the left, there is an attitude that &quot;well, it could be true, no one has proven it isn&#39;t...or it&#39;ll be true next time...or mentioning it stopped it from happening.&quot; The fact is, if you&#39;re pushing outright falsehoods with no credibility and little to nothing backing them beyond conjecture and lack of context, yet presenting it all as fact, it <em>is</em> fake news. </p>

<p>Pizzagate began as pure speculation based on little more than deciding a bunch of people talking about a pizza party <em>must</em> be something else...something evil. And mentions of pizza and food <em>must</em> be code words. It went from theory/speculation from a few folks looking for <em>anything</em> that <em>&quot;proves&quot;</em> Hillary &amp; Co to be even eviler than imagined before. Then, despite how very flimsy the theory was, other people who hate Clinton became determined to &quot;find the truth of what we already believe now,&quot; leading to more jumping on board. Shortly after, it became fake news when Alex Jones and others on the alt-right began reporting it as actual news based on fact.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Seems to be true, huh?</p>

<p>So I assume then that someone has finally found something that links someone to a specific act, crime, something? Because all there is so far is circumstantial evidence. And! Who is involved? Because this far, I&#39;ve seen the Podestas and Alefantis implicated, but not the amazingly complex network of pedophiles that people have been claiming.</p>

<p>In these emails, you will find that the Government of Haiti was denying the release of Laura Silsby based on their judicial process on behalf of Haitian parents that were claiming their children were being kidnapped by Silsby. These are emails sent directly to Hillary Clinton, upon whom it can be inferred was watching this case personally, as updates were being sent to her direct email.</p>

<p>The accusation of child trafficking by the Haitian judiciary is being fielded to Hillary Clinton, herself. You can poke holes, please do. Ask questions, investigate. What was the Clinton camp&#39;s personal interest in Laura Silsby&#39;s release from Haiti/release from charges of child trafficking?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, as the article points out, if you don&#39;t follow the legal framework for removing children from their families, it&#39;s considered kidnapping. </p>

<p>And she knew that, as we all know that. We all know that. </p>

<p>When you ignore a legal framework and kidnap 22 children (I say 22 because of the 33, 22 were known to have families), the local law will call that child trafficking, as your article points out. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ok. You have a much rosier view of the world than I do. Because given what we know, and given what we don&#39;t know, that&#39;s the most conclusive I will be. </p>

<p>Edit: no, I&#39;m going to fight this one a little harder. From the article, one can paint a picture of a woman wanting to do the right thing for under privilege (an understatement) kids, but you can also paint the picture of a predator taking advantage of a devastating situation:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Silsby had begun planning last summer to create the orphanage. When the earthquake struck she recruited other church members, and the 10 spent a week in Haiti gathering children for their project.</p>

<p>Most of the children came from the ravaged village of Callebas, where people told the AP they handed over their children because they were unable to feed or clothe them after the quake. They said the missionaries promised to educate the children and let relatives visit.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s not really rosy. I&#39;m not saying she couldn&#39;t be helping run a pedophile ring. We know Jeffrey Epstein&#39;s girlfriend sort of was and she showed up at Chelsea Clinton&#39;s wedding, so we have a few known pedophiles connected to the Clintons already right there. I&#39;m just saying this one thing, like the majority of the pizzagate &quot;evidence&quot; doesn&#39;t really prove anything and there are generally much more likely explanations. </p>

<p>The only thing that sits strange with me at this particular moment is the fact that the Comet Pizza Instagram avatar is a picture of a famous sculpture of Antinous, Greek teen boy lover of the Roman emperor Hadrian. But, again, it could just seem extra creepy given all the other &quot;evidence.&quot; I know gay men who would probably make such a joke if they liked young men (not underage) and were teased by their friends about it. It doesn&#39;t mean he&#39;s a pedophile; he could&#39;ve just been taking a tour of a museum in Italy and when they described the statue, thought it was a funny in-joke, and took the picture because he &quot;likes &#39;em young&quot; (but not underage). One of the bands at Comet Pizza made a joke about someone there liking &#39;em young to the crowd, so I don&#39;t think it&#39;s something very serious. You can&#39;t have a public pizza joint where parents take their kids regularly and have it known by everyone that it&#39;s a big pedo front. The secret just wouldn&#39;t be kept.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I understand, it is a lot of utterly circumstantial evidence. I think that&#39;s why there is so much curiosity, why this thing is still being talked about. </p>

<p>Lord, it&#39;d be great to be wrong about all this. That powerful people use their power to protect children, and not this speculation of horrors otherwise. I just don&#39;t look at all of these connections, and all of the people in government actually charged with CP and child sex abuse and draw those conclusions. </p>

<p>And if I don&#39;t believe my government is protecting children, but just the opposite, the horror deepens to life altering levels. So we do need a lot of critical eyes on this speculation.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>And thanks for your open mind as well.</p>

<p>I also hope that if they do find something REALLY damning that it blows up and people get put away. That didn&#39;t seem to happen in England with all the high-profile pedophiles there who are obviously well-connected. Just a few got busted. A female journalist who wanted to cover the story was ignored and finally wound up dead.</p>

<p>I believe the basic idea that important people are blackmailed with pedophilia and once they&#39;ve already got that hanging over their heads they just get as much underage sex as possible since the damage is already done. I don&#39;t believe every politician is involved, but the fact that both the Clintons and Trump were connected to Jeffrey Epstein is suspicious.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Lol you guys act like I&#39;m brand new to conspiracy theories.</p>

<p>It started with Loose Change when I was 15 or 16 and I haven&#39;t looked back since. Hell, I took an entire class on the assassination of jfk, granted it was student taught.</p>

<p>The reason I&#39;m so critical of pizzagate is because I&#39;ve looked into them for quite some time and this one stinks to high hell. It&#39;s laid out perfectly for people to end up down rabbit holes and end up nowhere. After 2 months, as you said, there is not one shred of evidence that implicates anyone in any crime. Everything is circumstantial.</p>

<p>T_D and pizzagate got disciplined for witch hunting, doxxing, brigading, etc. And really, it&#39;s not the first time T_D has been under scrutiny for shit like that. Given that pizzagate was predominantly pedes, it&#39;s not surprising they were banned. Banning T_D would have unleashed hell upon the admins. So they went after the smaller, less powerful sub.</p>

<p>The FBI hasn&#39;t removed anything I&#39;m aware of. The gov and media haven&#39;t either. They&#39;ve been pushing the anti fake news narrative, sure, but it&#39;s no different to me than the anti conspiracy theory rhetoric.</p>

<p>Err.....</p>

<p>r/pizzagate mods accusing the admin unban the guys who actually doxxing (which is pretty significant that it might be intentional sabotaging). It die down for a bit but still need to consider.</p>

<p>T_D member comment getting alter by u/spez and they got a bit loud mouth. But the leaked chat seems that the admin are REALLY want to shut it down, not because it&#39;s toxic, but because it might just broke their entire narrative of nobody supported Trump. They also try to make T_D completely disappear from r/all (A.K.A soft censoring). The other flag.</p>

<p>The &quot;Fake News&quot; and cover-ups are here. Maybe even a false flag attempt as well. The MSM didnt touch it for a month thinking it would not became big. Now it became big so they wanna shut it. Familiar?</p>

<p>Also the shills start to come in tho. Clearly they havent left r/politics and r/redacted. They are trying to flood in this sub as well. flag nr 4</p>

<p>Something smells fishy tho.......</p>

<p>Weird language in emails, supposed pedophile symbols and other unrelated cases of pedophiles is not evidence.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I first heard about some woman who was found dead in Haiti when investigating a child trafficking ring related to pizzagate. Then I checked /pol/ on 4Chan and the whole thing was blowing the hell up right there. Since then /pol/ is flooded with shills and disinformation agents shitposting all day. There is so much information, so many pictures and infographics floating around, but yet still people who only read a headline on Facebook without having looked into the matter continue to commit ad hominem and burden of proof. It makes me cynical that people like these exist and it makes me think that stupid people deserve what they get. But seeing some people still thinking rationally like you guys gives me hope to not give up and try to be of significance in this time in history. </p>
