        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>The Fake News cycle started as a way for Donald Trump to discredit Hillary. And we bought
it. As did a LOT of people. But let&#39;s look at it for what it is, logically.</p>

<p>Donald Trump spoke, BEFORE all this crap, about passing laws to take down media he
did not like, did not agree with, and wanted to punish. NY Times.</p>

<p>Shortly after, we got Pizzagate. A divisive theory that got a LOT of people and
a sub banned from Reddit.</p>

<p>This pizza conspiracy continued to dominate the news during the election. Which only
served the GOP. And added fuel to the calls to &#39;lock her up.&#39;</p>

<p>Fine. But it has continued after the election. And even expanded with MORE &#39;fake news.&#39;</p>

<p>The goal this time is to silence dissent of all types. Meaning us, meaning any &#39;news source&#39;
the government does not like.</p>

<p>Soon, the government will pass new laws that outlaw freedom of speech in the name of &#39;protecting&#39; 
innocents  harmed by the Fake News THEY created and nurtured. Already happening in the UK.</p>

<p>Who gets to decide what is News and what is Fake News? The government, of course.</p>

<p>The flag burning debate? A prelude to altering the First Amendment. Not via the constitution, but
by stirring up anger and derision using &#39;Fake News&#39; as the excuse.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.dslreports.com/shownews/Trump-Advisor-Blackburn-Wants-ISPs-to-Pull-Fake-News-Offline-138450">https://www.dslreports.com/shownews/Trump-Advisor-Blackburn-Wants-ISPs-to-Pull-Fake-News-Offline-138450</a></p>

<p>Look at the  House Bill that passed a couple days ago. It allows the government to
decide which news sources are Russian Propaganda. At their discretion. How long until they
come for <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> ?</p>

<p>This is a consolidation of power. And it is a major sign that something is afoot, that Donald
Trump is readying a takeover of media. And after that? Well, he has already telegraphed much of
his plan. It involves mass deportations, imprisonment for dissenters, rule by military force 
(the National Guard is already patrolling our border and could easily be used against 
so-called Sanctuary Cities) and on and on.</p>

<p>Once the inevitable protests erupt in Sanctuary Cities, Trump has all the reasons he needs to
declare Martial Law nationwide. Think I am joking? Just look, carefully, at his appointees.
He has loaded his administration with military lackeys who maintain total loyalty to HIM. Not
to the Constitution, but loyalty to Donald Trump.</p>

<p>Fake News (pizza gate) is a pretext to wipe out <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> and other news and forum sites
across the social web. Trump will target anyone who opposes him or espouses Truth To Power.</p>

<p>We cannot let this happen. This is our First Amendment under attack in a calculated and broad
assassination attempt during daylight. We must find a way to fight this.</p>

<p>People have taken the bait, planted by Trump, Clinton, or the Russians. Who did it doesn&#39;t much matter.
Now it is a pretext to shut us all down, to censor us, in the name of protecting innocent people 
like &#39;pizza parlor owners.&#39; WE are the innocents and THEY built this to distract us and 
tear us apart. And we were not even looking.</p>

<p>What now? I don&#39;t have the slightest clue. It may be too late.</p>

<p>State controlled government &#39;news&#39; is the next logical step.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Anyone posting here about how Trump will not further censorship in the United States of America is fundamentally confused about what Trump is about.</p>

<p>He is a con man and is only concerned with himself.  He will say anything to get his way.  He uses money and power to bully people beneath him and treats the judicial system as if it were a toy, or some kind of game.</p>

<p>The entire arguement that because Trump is not a career politician, he will clean house in Washington (drain the swamp), actually has more negative potential with the issue of free speech, because there are no political implications for him down the road.  He is not viewed as part of the Republican core, so they have plausible deniability for everything he does and based on his successful campaign, he has no reasons to walk on eggshells once in office.  He can directly or indirectly damage the 1st Amendment and he would only face a fraction of the consequences compared to any other politician.  He has more leeway to make this happen than any other known political figure.</p>

<p>Based on his life story, if Trump did destroy free speech in America, I&#39;m even inclined to believe he would come out on top.</p>

<p>The First Amendment is the most fundamental principle of freedom for every society.  Undoing it would completely destroy the foundations of our democracy, leaving Americans (and many other nations as a result) completely vulnerable to fascism and similarly detestable social existences.</p>

<p>Trump is no champion of the people and we should be very wary of the erosion of our rights by his hand.</p>

<p>I hope Trump proves me wrong, but I sincerely doubt it.</p>

The left enables or sparks it, the right enacts the laws, the left come back and take it over, the right pushes back. both sides are working together knowing or unknowingly. Its all by design to create a society that has nothing to do with individual rights or capitalism.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, anti-Trump sentiment on both sides is probably because there are lots of red flags regarding Trump&#39;s moral fiber.  It doesn&#39;t take a liberal or a conservative to pick up on that.</p>

<p>I feel there&#39;s about an equal amount of distrust of Hillary Clinton on both sides of the aisle, but for more clandestine reasons, as there is less proof that her morals are not aligned with the forces of what most consider good.  </p>

<p>As far as big media controlling the narrative, what else is new?  What is frightening these days is the complexity and scope of how they do this (reaching millions of global consumers with polished stories that are quite believable on the surface, but may not be true objective journalism and manipulating internet content at will).</p>

<p>This thread is not a psy-op, as protecting 1st Amendment rights transcends party lines.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Only having two parties is one of many problems with our system.</p>

<p>Democrats need to bite the bullet and vote en masse for a third party for the next several election cycles in order to break the chain.</p>

<p>I would suggest Republucans do the same, but that party tows the party line much more faithfully, so I think it will never stick.</p>

<p>Also, winner take all needs to go, electoral college needs to go, voting needs to be held on national holidays and be accessible to all (no disenfranchisement), and a bevy of other reforms that create transparency and social equality.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You have obviously given this some thought.</p>

<p>You vocalize my great fear: That we will have a &#39;list&#39; of approved news sources. And everyone else will be outlawed by the government.</p>

<p>The government will remove any sites or content that do not support the government view.</p>

<p>And if people keep pushing back the government will imprison them. Trump has already said he will expand Guantanamo to hold ONE MILLION prisoners. There are nowhere near a million foreign nationals he can imprison.</p>

<p>Where will he find people to jail?</p>

<p>Among his opponents.</p>

<p>This is stark reality and the man now has the executive pen.</p>

<p>The idea that those in power are sometimes wrong is completely fine -- we&#39;re all wrong sometimes -- but these citizens&#39; argument is that they themselves as citizens don&#39;t even have the right to question.  </p>

<p>It&#39;s worrisome that they&#39;ve accepted, and are actually individually enforcing this idea, via rhetoric about either not being a patriot, or being racist, misogynistic, etc. -- essentially spitting vitriol and socially shaming -- in the name of authority.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>If what you stated in your OP actually happened, there would be a revolution. They cant do all that yet. Trump is just a loud mouth who channeled people&#39;s utter disdain for anything that was part of the established system. I think you are overreacting on that front, just like people did when they said Obama was going to declare Martial Law and and and.. people still maintain the spirit of resistance against oppression, so another path is needed..</p>

<p>I 100% agree with you about entities aiming to destroy the first amendment; they&#39;ve already seriously gutted the 4th amendment. The concept of even <em>allowing</em> let alone <em>encouraging</em> censorship is a complete violation of the first amendment&#39;s spirit. Corporations will wield this power to grow their bottom line (by shaping opinion, extorting from those trying to avoid &quot;the list,&quot; etc), and the .gov will leverage NSLs to silence via these censorship controls anything that threatens what they want to do. This is not even considering how any censorship inevitably establishes a &quot;box&quot; around free thought. And even worse- the master/idiot relationship that is implied by this push for censorship; people are <em>too stupid</em> to discern fact from fiction, and thus a <em>master class</em> of people/corporate-entities need to tell them what <em>real news</em> is... wtf, have we all lost our fucking minds?</p>

<p>Whether this is a conscious concerted effort by evil men in a dark room or the natural progression of how power (what the gov has) without any competing form of power (the power the People were <em>supposed</em> to have) consolidating into a single source (tyranny), I dont know. Whichever it is, it is happening (relatively) slowly instead of literally all at once; this boils the frog slowly, and thus slowly conditions people into a state of compliance. </p>

<p>If it is the &quot;evil men in a dark room&quot; scenario, I seriously doubt that its anything like &quot;muhahahaha lets take their rights and create a hell on earth because we can!&quot; Instead, its probably more like &quot;technology has become so powerful a single citizen with a bomb or a keyboard can kill many people or throw the state into disarray; we need methods to control the people because <em>we</em> know better.&quot; Regardless of their intentions- whether truly evil or ostensibly benevolent- no entity that assumes superiority over societal direction should ever be entitled to determine that direction.</p>

<p>I suggest that as we spread word of attacks on the first amendment, we strip all the stuff about Trump declaring Martial Law, global orders, Guantanamo, etc and <em>focus instead on what is irrefutable and demonstrable through history.</em> We can <em>see</em> that the 4th amendment has been gutted and we can prove that; we can <em>see</em> that censorship is a central theme in virtually every dystopian novel ever written, and thus ideologically we can understand it as either the precursor or preservation of evil; we can <em>see</em> and <em>prove</em> that Trump has made hostile statements in regards to Constitutional rights, and thus we can make a case that the People need to pay attention, etc etc etc. These are things that wont scare away people who stay away from places like <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>, but nonetheless furthers the cause of protecting the first amendment.</p>

<p>With the NSA abilities we know about, this would be relatively simple. Probably require many people, but hey, that&#39;s creating jobs in America!</p>

<p>And who knows what capabilities the NSA has that remain unknown? There are reasons many people, especially tech insiders, tape over their web cams and disconnect their microphones. They know what can happen.</p>

<p>The Fake News cycle started as a way for Donald Trump to discredit Hillary.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The mainstream media has always been &quot;fake.&quot; It wasn&#39;t started by Trump. He just pointed out what everyone who has disconnected from the propaganda already knew.</p>

<p>This recent &quot;fake news&quot; movement is trying to discredit the independent journalists who utilize the equal playing field of the internet and are informing people of news that you can&#39;t find on mainstream media. The mainstream media are the ones pushing the &quot;fake news&quot; story against the non-mainstream. Everything about this points to them wanting to censor the internet, not the mainstream behemoth groups.</p>

<p>So if Trump is going against the mainstream media, which has always been fake news and propaganda, why are you spinning this around into a bad thing? ...</p>

I&#39;m not sure how this would affect smaller media, they are far less likely to actually report false information knowingly.

<p>CIA have been paying off journalists, authors and news agencies for DECADES already. This isn&#39;t the next logical step, it&#39;s fucking history. As soon as MKultra failed to provide an easily implementable solution on how to brainwash people into obedient robots they turned to mass media and have been consolidating their influence there since that.</p>

<p>Regarding trump, he&#39;s tired of MSM throwing feces at him day out and day in.</p>

<p>Fake news is a reaction to the enormous impact alt media had on the election. They were completely run over and discredited by people by various micro media instances and posters, what they&#39;re doing now is systematizing their character assassination approach to micro media sources in an attempt to regain a fragment of the credibility they burned away during the late part of the election. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, the &quot;fake news&quot; meme is pretext for widespread censorship... but this did not begin until Wikileaks released the Podesta emails. </p>

<p>This censorship movement taking place is cover for real crimes, pizzagate included - the child trafficking and ritualistic abuse, and many other crimes that have only been partially uncovered so far.</p>

<p>The desperation of the media and governing establishment to deflect, distract and condemn  is indicative of how big this really is.</p>

<p>Trump is assembling a cabinet of military veterans who are OPPOSED to globalism and the criminal establishment which has infested so many governments. The MSM despises Trump for his independent viewpoints (which are threatening to their false narratives), and the Russians are scapegoats who have been continually used as a boogeyman to serve many agendas.</p>

<p>Yes things are dire and there are many entities who wish to silence us and control us. Trump is not perfect, far from it, but he is not an enemy of the American people. This is the trap that is being set... People need to stop casting blame for what they think he MIGHT do, and start focusing on what others are actually doing. </p>

I think most of us in that subreddit are well aware we are not liked, we are also the only subreddit that provides another side of story that the mainstream media will either not cover or do its best to corrupt what is being said and spin it to play partisan politics which has made it impossible for people on the left or right to realize we are both being played.

<p>This is my issue. I don&#39;t care much about his politics, or Hillary or Bush or Obama for that matter.</p>

<p>What I care about is that the American people are being treated as idiots.</p>

<p>And, the thrust of my concern in this post, is that government is trying to take away our Constitutional rights. All this started under a Democrat (Obama) and has been stoked into nearly a wildfire by a Republican (Trump).</p>

<p>I don&#39;t like people fucking with the First Amendment, no matter who it might be. That is probably the most important Amendment in the entire Constitution. If we cannot speak our mind without fear, we are unable to fight for all the other Amendments.</p>

<p>If we criticize him for something let it be serious enough to warrant criticism when he gets into office and not Trump won&#39;t talk to the media (because they lie and spin nonsense or censor information (lookin at you <a href="/u/spez">/u/spez</a>)) or he says mean things (which have a kernel of truth hint violent Islamic Extremist and dangerous illegal immigrants).

    <div class="md"><p>I agree with you in part. And disagree in part.</p>

<p>The troubling issue for me is that he has made media his enemy. And not just MSM. All media. He has done everything I linked earlier in the thread and threatened worse. Not cool at all.</p>

<p>I agree with your point that we need to see what he actually does. That is a valid and very legit point. After he is inaugurated, I plan to follow his every move. I will criticize all the wrong I perceive. I will applaud the good I see.</p>

<p>This is what I would do regardless of who won.</p>

<p>I have never seen danger signs like these First Amendment threats in any previous president elect. And I have been watching elections since the early 70s. This is where I am hopeful that Trump supporters are right, that he speaks loudly as bluster to negotiate better deals.</p>

<p>But I do not see a better deal than our First Amendment.</p>

<p>I will give him time, but I will also call him out along the way.</p>

<p>Thank you for interacting respectfully. I do appreciate your thoughts and agree with some of your views. We will need to all find common ground as this goes forward. Division is an old trick of government that only serves them.</p>

We are leaving entire groups of people behind as we enter overpopulation and media manipulation. Unemployment rate is at 4.5 to 4.9%? We all know this number is a lie. We know a fuck ton of stuff is a lie. We need to rally. Fuck. The people that need to stand up and demand change need to pool some resources. We need some god damn organization. I see subs such as pizzagate and conspiracy and commend the efforts we all put in towards awareness and investigation but we are easily derailed and misguided. Who will survive in America? Who will take the responsibility to bring us together? Cause it sure as hell isn&#39;t any of us. The mantle is too heavy. A lot of people thought it was going to be Trump. That mother fucker is running around like a headless chicken talking to everyone and starting all these plans when he does not have the faintest clue of what he is doing.

<p>My &#39;relief&#39; would be confined to that one area: preservation of our Freedom of Speech. There are a great many subjects under threat.</p>

<p>So many, in fact, that no one person can try to track them all. That&#39;s where insanity reigns. Too much shit, day after day. You&#39;ll kill yourself out of depression and sadness if you go down that road.</p>

<p>My only goal, with this post, is to try to sound the alarm over looming threats against media of all types, youtubers, forum posters, anyone who might say something government disagrees with.</p>

<p>I have many other worries. But if I listed them all it would take a LOT of space. And no one would read a list that long. Awareness, I think, only comes one issue at a time, one person at a time.</p>

<p>Others, I hope, are tackling other issues. Like you just did. Keep telling people. That is part of our fight. And it will be a long 4 years. Or 8 years.</p>

<p>Censorship that is inherent in avoiding the White House Press Corp. <a href="http://money.cnn.com/2016/11/16/media/donald-trump-press-pool-tension/">Lack of access</a> is censorship by definition. Can&#39;t report what you can&#39;t witness.</p>

<p>Encouraging <a href="http://www.newsweek.com/2016-election-donald-trump-press-freedom-first-amendment-520389">harassment</a> of journalists covering the president.</p>

<p>These are only some of the examples that show how Trump is attacking or trying to censor Freedom of Speech. And he is not yet in office.</p>

<p>His power expands greatly on January 20.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Two things I&#39;m going to add here. The first one being that the media is clearly lying consistently for Hillary Clinton. Constantly spreading false narratives and propaganda burying Donald Trump repeatedly. Saying things that are absolutely false. And the second thing is you do not Empower people with guns and then put them into martial law. You take away their guns before you put them into martial law. It&#39;s literally two coinciding steps on the process. First you take away the guns, the next step is martial law. Donald Trump is clearly an advocate for us to have our guns, Hillary Clinton was clearly the advocate for us to lose our guns.</p>

<p>You are suggesting the US would allow UN peacekeepers on our own soil? I find that very unlikely, regardless of any president. Can&#39;t imagine Bush, Clinton, Obama, Reagan, any of them allowing such a thing.</p>

<p>The UN forces are a tiny sliver of the US military in any case.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thank you. I was unaware of this UN approved agreement. However, it is entirely ceremonial unless the UN can come up with enough troops to replace the US military. I cannot imagine any circumstance where the US, or its citizens, would accept such a move.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>account for more than 40,000 U.N. troops and police, well over one-third of U.N. peacekeepers.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So the TOTAL of UN peacekeepers is around 120k troops? This is a tiny number compared to the US military and essentially meaningless in any American context.</p>

<p>Any serious involvement of violence in the US would require US military force.</p>

<p>Thank you, though, seriously, for educating me on the UN process. It was interesting and I learned new stuff. For that, I am grateful.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>For whatever reason you&#39;re being downvoted, your point only makes sense to me. For many years we have dismissed the possibility of our own military being the ones who annihilate our country, because of the assumption of these military folk having family members, loved ones, etc. that they would refuse to harm. </p>

<p>Why, then, is it so unlikely that a foreign army would be invited to help do what our own army has done for almost a hundred years on <em>other</em> people&#39;s soil? We have very confidently <em>brought freedom to</em> (invaded and destroyed) other countries, and for this our history books sing our praises as a country. </p>

<p>It would not shock me in the least if armies from China, Russia, Colombia, Venezuela, or any other country we&#39;ve been shit-talking for so long decided to give us a little taste of our own medicine, so to speak. And we wouldn&#39;t even realize it until our families, friends, and loved ones are murdered just as any other nation&#39;s people were.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree, but the only way to defeat a mainstream media that is attempting to censor its opponents is to censor it out.</p>

<p>I believe a media-coup is a great thing. as long as the replacement media is honest and opens up to a localized free market version instead of monopolizing itself.</p>

<p>the problem is global monopolies with vested interests owning the media and censoring their opponents. </p>

<p>laws need to be put in place which keeps media nationalistic, as far as news goes, and as localized as possible. Global content should be available, of course, but localized independence must be assured, as well as open discussion of wide arrays of viewpoints.</p>

<p>we need to censor, and remove the current bad crop, and rebuild these institutions from the bottom up independently.</p>

<p>they are trying to censor the opposition RIGHT NOW. maybe you don&#39;t like the opposition, maybe you believe its fake news and the CNN and Fox is real...</p>

<p>but it is the current elites and current crop of mainstream networks driving the censorship fervor because they are losing their power and going bankrupt and nobody trusts them.</p>

<p>we need to be able to censor censorers, break up their monopolies, whether or not they like it. If real change is to occur, they cannot have a voice.</p>

<p>because they rigged the system to make their voice louder than anyone elses, and they are losing that power, but they still have enough that their opinion vastly outweighs the power of the larger majority that is against them.</p>

<p>this is the definition of tyranny, and censorship, because it is quickly becoming a top-down system of control of information.</p>

<p>we already are in the tyranny -- our media has been sold out and paid for, virtual dictatorship was already well on its way, oiling the cogs of the machine getting ready to turn on the power.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t necessarily believe good things will happen as things are. I don&#39;t think things can be fixed so simply.</p>

<p>but I truly believe what Ive said to be true. that we need to take extreme measures, only because those against us are using them on us.</p>

<p>when other people try to commit genocide, the only proper response is to genocide that group, unless there is a way to ideologically reach them. but when they are in the process you gotta strike back twice as hard with half the emotion of your opponent. </p>

<p>otherwise its just over for you, and you can walk into the slaughterhouse with a big smile on your face believing the promised land lies just behind those doors, unknowing of the darkness that truly awaits.</p>

<p>we need absolute populist takeover. and we need it soon. they are controlling the flow of information and preventing the true (hopefully) peaceful revolution.</p>

<p>under the current system, the margins always seem to grow economically, because all wealth is consolidated in few hands, and these individuals reap profit while the majority starves, suffers austerity for their masters debts, and they become increasingly reliant on the dole.</p>

<p>and once automation comes, they will just be starved off and later humiliated and lied about like the luddites. that free insurance will disappear once its the only insurance co on the market at all. it will be elites only and everyone else will either die or be subject unknowingly to forced human experimentation.</p>

<p>and I&#39;m reliant on it and scared to lose it personally, so I&#39;m not biased in terms of wealth.</p>

<p>the only real hope for any change in our favor is to totally nullify the voice of the tyrants and censorers, as slippery a slope as it may be.</p>

<p>the replacement media regime has to be benevolent, populist/local controlled by citizens, and divested of the economic and social interests that have infected the entire system.</p>

<p>the new media should have more freedom and less censorship, and open to all views, but not be propaganda outlets.</p>
