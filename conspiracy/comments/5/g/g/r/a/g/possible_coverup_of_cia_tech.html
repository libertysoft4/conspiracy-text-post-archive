        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Last friday, <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/gadgets/comments/5g4o64/in_the_1970s_the_cia_created_a_spy_drone_the_size/">a post on /r/gadgets</a> hit the frontpage of <a href="/r/all">/r/all</a> mentioning a CIA-made dragonfly-sized drone developed in the seventies. One of the comments mentioned they&#39;ve continued to develop on that technology and managed to create tick-sized drones, and goes as follows:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>They have continued to work on this project. If you want proof, unfortunately you won&#39;t find it online as far I as I&#39;ve seen, but you will find it in the CIA&#39;s invitation-only museum in their Langley headquarters. I received an invitation to the museum years ago as an award for a science fair project, I guess as a part of the CIA&#39;s recruitment efforts. They had quite a few interesting items on display, especially in retrospect. They had a demo of their new biometrics database for identifying people based on photos, fingerprints, etc. They had a speaker who, reading in between the lines, spoke about his work on the CIA drone program which at the time was highly classified but kind of an open secret in Washington. They also had some interesting gifts given to the US by foreign dignitaries, some Matryoshka dolls from Russia, Kabuki masks from Japan, etc. Two things in particular really caught my eye, as well as the rest of the crowd, which consisted of teenage kids and their parents who were invited along. They had robots, roughly cube-shaped with tank treads and with a footprint about the size of a quarter. Apparently each of the robots had separate functionality, and they could be thrown into a ventilation grate, reassemble by snapping together magnetically, then take photos and audio from within whatever facility they were infiltrating. The best part though was their insect drone. It looked like a slightly-larger-than-real-life matte-black wasp with what appeared to be solar panels on its wings. They said that it could fly about a kilometer per day, at which point it would stop to recharge, and it could record video/audio. They told us an amusing anecdote about how some Russian dignitary had learned of these robots, and said that he would be &quot;swatting every fly at his next barbecue&quot;. Flash forward a few years, and I was attending an event with a lot of robotics and AI researchers present. During lunch I had a few drinks with a group of people, and somehow the subject of the CIA museum came up. One guy had actually visited this museum too, but as an employee rather than a student. I mentioned the drone, he described what I had seen as &quot;version 10&quot; and that he worked on &quot;version 30&quot;. His friends/colleagues had a kind of puzzled look on their faces like they had never heard any of this stuff before. I asked him what the form factor of &quot;version 30&quot; was, and he said it was &quot;a tick&quot; and apparently a life-sized one. I didn&#39;t ask much more about the subject because I sensed I was prying too far. But I did ask how that wasp drone came to exist, because I had previously done some research on the subject and only found university projects investigating creating flying robots of that size that were laughably primitive in comparison. He basically said that the technology and science is all out there, but very few organizations have the means or motive to spend a few billion dollars to get to it. On a more conspiratorial note, during the Occupy Wall Street protests, I noted that there were a few reports of strange looking insects flying above the scene, and immediately thought of that wasp drone.</p>

<p>When attempting to refer it to someone else, i&#39;ve found out the thread <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Nudelete/comments/5g9q83/1465026901_in_the_1970s_the_cia_created_a_spy/">was</a> <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/longtail/comments/5g9q6k/1475025901_in_the_1970s_the_cia_created_a_spy/">deleted</a> and the post is gone, <a href="https://www.unreddit.com/r/gadgets/comments/5g4o64/in_the_1970s_the_cia_created_a_spy_drone_the_size/">even from removed</a> <a href="https://www.ceddit.com/r/gadgets/comments/5g4o64/in_the_1970s_the_cia_created_a_spy_drone_the_size/">comment scrappers</a>.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Exactly what I thought as well. If they made dragonfly sized bots that record audio/video in the 70s and we assume that they&#39;re around 20 - 30 years ahead in tech then it would be safe to assume that they have reduced their size and increased efficiency to match that of ticks or even smaller. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Damn... I don&#39;t remember where I saw it... or what context even... but it was a series of picture of chrysalises with small vials or chips being implanted in the ex-caterpillar as it transformed... so that in the event that it didn&#39;t kill it as a pupa they would have an a living organic adult moth/butterfly... but with the device implanted inside. I don&#39;t remember what the endgame was supposed to be... but it reminds me of an offshoot of what you are describing here. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Interesting, could it possibly be that the OP deleted it? I remember reading through almost all of those comments and there were two different people who had gone to the invite only museum and gave first hand accounts.</p>

<p>The conversation on that topic quickly changed to neurodust and the like, but for the most part it was all discussion on how the government is debatably 10-30 years ahead on tech as opposed to the public. I thought it was common knowledge that the government had insect sized spying capabilities. 
Something I would be more keen on is the EM drive, it&#39;s like the microwave of our time! </p>
