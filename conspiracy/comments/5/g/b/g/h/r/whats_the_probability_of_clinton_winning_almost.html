    <div class="md"><p>Highjacking top comment, sorry.</p>

<p>If the election results overturn there&#39;s going to be blood. Everyone thinks trump has won, but if it gets overturned(via electoral college being brigaded/threatened, or recount results), there&#39;s going to be people with guns on the street. It&#39;s like being given something you like, but they just yank it back and say &quot;psych!&quot; but on a much larger scale.</p>

<p>Honestly, I&#39;m hoping it leads to enough outrage that it turns into a civil war. We can&#39;t fix this country any other way. The military would likely refuse to harm us, for two reasons; </p>

<p>1: Their creed is to protect from all threats, foreign and domestic(You would think that means those who are marching, but they should know that we&#39;re marching against corruption). </p>

<p>2: They know we&#39;re humans too. We have families, friends, sons and daughters. They wouldn&#39;t be able to live with themselves if they harmed us, especially knowing how their own family would feel if he/she died.</p>

<p>This would mean they would either refuse to fight, putting on a massive protest, or join the revolution, bringing with them(sometimes) entire bases of military weapons. The only thing we would have to worry about is top secret/black project weapons that basically nobody knows about other than those working on it and a few superiors.(IE Area 51, which is real, but we don&#39;t know what is in there. I&#39;m thinking either extremely advanced technology we built ourselves, or reverse engineered tech.)</p>

<p>It would likely mostly be fighting against militarized police, who have a creed quite different from the military; they must follow all orders from the president and uphold the constitution(lol).</p>

<p>Also, a note about the advanced tech: there was an article(from a &quot;mainstream&quot; or &quot;reliable&quot; source talking about VR. In it they had a quote from microsoft that they had working hologram(Actual hologram) technology they are working on for Virtual reality purposes. If they have this now, I wonder how long the military has had it... Perhaps that lends new credence to the hologram theory from 9/11.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m quite the opposite of a Hillary supporter, but I have an alternate view of the election results. Most election integrity analysts believe the election was rigged in Trump&#39;s favor. This was initially surprising to me, but after I saw the media legitimizing the idea of a recount, I came up with an idea. What if they wanted fraud for Trump to get caught so it could be blamed on Russia?</p>

<p>Back in August, the media strangely began talking about voting machine security issues (which they almost never did before), but kept alluding to the possibility that Russians would hack them. This is ludicrous; every election integrity expert agrees that insiders are the real threat. But clearly, the media wanted us to fear Russians rigging the election results.</p>

<p>The media&#39;s attempt to convince us Russians would rig the election, combined with tying Trump to Russia, made it look like the establishment planned to pin a Trump victory on Russian hacking. Might they even go farther and commit fraud in Trump&#39;s favor so it would look like Russia did it?</p>

<p>I suspected this might happen way back in August, but forgot about it until last week. Trump benefiting from fraud was incredibly confusing to me, since it made no sense to rig the election for him. And then the media started discussing how cybersecurity experts wanted Hillary to challenge the results. In the past 16 years, they never took election integrity seriously, and now they suddenly wanted to. Clearly, they expected to gain something. That made me think this was all planned: rig for Trump, challenge the results, overturn them in Hillary&#39;s favor, and blame it all on Russia.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My above belief about the recount&#39;s purpose is a major part of why I oppose it. I&#39;m also concerned that the recount itself will be rigged, and could be used to produce any result, regardless of whether it reflects voter intent.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree that this is a possibility.  Russia is being blames in the house and senate for &quot;election tampering&quot; and we&#39;re likely to see a report in next two weeks regarding it.</p>

<p>But as far as the very tight race in PA goes, I don&#39;t understand how not all of the votes have been counted yet when the race is supposedly so close.  But I&#39;m only seeing the certified numbers.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>99% reporting (9,136 of 9,158 precincts)</p>

<p>Ballotpedia cites the NYT for their number, but the NYT has added ~70k votes for hillary and slightly less for donald- ~60K...</p>

<p>This is what&#39;s worth noting:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Out of 6 million votes cast in Pennsylvania, the latest tallies put Trump&#39;s lead at 0.8 percent. State law would&#39;ve required an automatic statewide recount if the lead was within 0.5 percent.</p>

In a tight, scandal plagued race Hillary appeared to be able to secure a win by rigging votes in key states, but knew that it would be caught. What to do? Why not rig the votes to Favor Trump, have a third-party expose the fraud in a plot involving Trump and Russia?</a></p>

<p>The same vibe.</p>

<p>Too many powerful people invested too much into Hillary&#39;s campaign to see this die.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Wow, interesting to see that you thought of this as well. My first theory for why the election appeared rigged for Trump was that Hillary was too damaged of a candidate, for the reasons you lay out. Then, when I saw the media taking the recount effort seriously, I returned to my theory from August that it would be intentionally rigged for Trump to be pinned on Russia. I wrote up my thoughts <a href="http://www.opednews.com/articles/Calls-For-a-Recount-Don-t-by-George-Klees-Democratic_Democrats_Establishment_Media-161128-370.html">in this article</a>. But it could actually, fitting with your theory, be a mixture of both reasons.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, what I do know, is that here in Michigan the turnout for Trump was <em>huge</em>. There were <em>miles</em> of lines waiting for the chance to hear him speak, thousands of people gathering and stayed well past 1 in the flippin morning on his final rally here. Whereas I didn&#39;t see anywhere near that much turnout for Hillary, and given how biased most of the MSM was in her favor, I&#39;d figure that if she pulled those sorts of crowd numbers here, then at least one outlet would have showed it. I mean we were often told that she had stronger &quot;ground game&quot; but I can at least speak for this state in saying that that wasn&#39;t the case here. And this was even in Southeast MI where we have a pretty diverse population in all regards, hell we have the largest concentration of Muslims in the entire country. </p>

<p>When there are liars and smoke screens everywhere you turn, sometimes it&#39;s important to just step away from the computer and look at the actual world around you for a moment. And in doing that, it didn&#39;t surprise me that Michigan went red, if we are to assume that the winner isn&#39;t predetermined by TPTB, anyway.</p>

<p>The best trolling (winning) strategy for now would be to stay within the rules, united and not get distracted by the provocation or viral trends. That&#39;s what Trump would do and has done anyway. He isn&#39;t the barking type who gets all emotional, that&#39;s why he won.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m sort of interested to know how OP has calculated his probabilities.</p>

<p>If there were some kind of effort to steal the election on behalf of the GOP, then most discounted votes being Clinton votes wouldn&#39;t be at all improbable, in fact it would be exactly what you expected.</p>

<p>I think the logic being applied by OP is like finding a Jewish cemetery in a large city and claiming it must be a fake because <em>&#39;What are the odds of so many Jewish people being buried in one place?&#39;</em> I.e., chance distribution is being invoked where it&#39;s not necessarily relevant.</p>

<p>We shall see what the results of the recounts are. I suspect there isn&#39;t going to be a happy ending to all this, whatever comes out.</p>

<p>As an actuary I have to agree. </p>
