        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>This is this deal... I&#39;ve been hearing PIZZAGATE is a Psyops, a distraction to the BIGGER Picture. So, what is the bigger picture? Well, I think i found the BIGGER picture and Pizzagate branches off of it!!  This is the connection...</p>

<p>There&#39;s 24 pictures of Antarctica in WIKILEAKS.<br/>
Why the fuck would Julian attach pictures of ice and penguins?? There is something in Antarctica that Julian wants us to know about? There might be messages hidden in these pictures. I think that was what phase 3 was gonna be about.</p>

<p>On oct 28 all the counties that have rights to Antarctica signed a treaty banning fishing in Antarctica for the next 35 years.They say we are trying to save the Chilean sea bass. I call bullshit. I think this is to keep traffic down to a minimum.

<p>Also this old man (explorer who conquered Everest  ) planned a trip to Antarctica around November 13 and foreign powers made him reschedule his trip for a later date. Something was going in Antarctica during this time period

<p>John Kerry visited Antarctica Nov 11-13, what the fuck was he doing there? This was after his visit with U.K. And Ecuadorian embassy. </p>

<p>Timeline of John Kerry 
Sept 26 John Kerry visited Columbia (Near Ecuador)
Oct 16-17  to U.K. And Ecuador embassy. The day Julian went missing. 
Nov 7 Kerry flew out of the US and landed in New Zealand
Nov. 10 the same day a 7.8 earthquake rattles NZ. <a href="https://www.google.com/amp/s/amp.ibtimes.co.uk/earthquake-7-4-magnitude-hits-new-zealand-near-christchurch-1591300?client=safari">here</a> 
Nov 11-13 he arrives in Antarctica Nov 12. </p>

<p>Where was he the 3 days in between US and NZ?? </p>

<p>U.K. US and Russia are they key countries heavily into expeditions in Antarctica. A week ago Russia drilled 2 miles into the ice hitting a underground body of water. The scientist dropped in the hole to inspect and ended up getting killed by a giant 12 legged octopus.

<p>During this research my leads keep dead ending into alien shit. So figured I look into that...
Comet ping pong has pictures of aliens playing ping pong with humans </p>

<p>Above are emails I found in the Pedestal emails under the search &quot;Aliens and extraterrestrial&quot; 
I didn&#39;t check DNCleaks </p>

<p>Everyone was worried about searching for PIZZAGATE and overlooked this. Pizza gate is just a small piece of the BIGGER picture!!! If you use twitter, add on to your hashtags #pizzagate #AlienGate </p>

<p>Germany was the first country that was interested in Antarctica. Hitler&#39;s theory was the earth was hollow and the poles at the end of the earth were the entrance into the center. He said the bloodline elites lived in there (fallen angels or theory is they are reptilian) Hitler was so interested in what was there that he CONTINUED his expedition while WW2 was going on. </p>

<p>There is something there!!!! Julian was trying to tell us by alll the pictures in the leaks. My anon friend said Julian worked out a deal with the CIA and world govts to leak out certain emails to control the minds of the population. If this is true, then Julian would have to communicate with us thru hidden code. So, when searching in WL we need to look for code language. </p>

<p>First off let me say... Cloning is real, all governments do it. The elites have been pre conditioning us about cloning for a LONG time. 
There&#39;s been many cloning movies that give us clues. The freemasonry symbol is identical to the movie Avatar. Which is about cloning humans and aliens
<a href="https://sli.mg/xemLLt">Avatar and Masonry </a> 
, 
 <a href="https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=oEBMJOB86pQ">Kayne West Cloning music video </a> ,</p>

<p><a href="https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=eQFIKP9rGhQ">Britney Spears Cloning center music video </a> </p>

<p>the Simpsons have episode on cloning
<a href="https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=HLITQXRH70M">https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=HLITQXRH70M</a></p>

<p>Here&#39;s an example of a Britney Spears clone. Looks nothing like her. She posted this on her twitter. 
 <a href="https://sli.mg/5eZSU5">clone </a> </p>

<p>Here is info from a guy named Don Marshall, he said he&#39;s been to the cloning centers and tells all. He can easily be a puppet of the illuminati but he&#39;s giving us this info for A REASON. To condition the public...
<a href="http://donaldmarshallrevolution.com">don Marshall </a></p>

<p>George Green was an insider and he tells us about how the elites are cloning and have contact with aliens. 
He said they used to hologram, but now they can clone a walking talking real life person since 2008. 
<a href="https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=1PIKUslVwbs">https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=1PIKUslVwbs</a>
I think the above two people are puppets but are part of the &quot;pre conditioning&quot; the public for what is to come. </p>

<p>Also, Phillip Schneider worked for the govt building underground bunkers. He said there were 300 + in the US and mentioned Antarctica too. He said the govt budget for this type SHIT is half a trillion. Each bunker cost $17 billion and takes about 2 years to build. The govt averages 3 a year. He also says there is underground railroads the connect all the bunkers which blows the technology we have out of the water. Their technology and roadways make us look ancient. I think this is why trump says our roadways are 3rd world bc he prob knows what type of high tech stuff they have underground. There was a video he posted of the underground bunkers (I think) but it looks like it&#39;s been deleted. Phillip also told us there were grey aliens living underground too and he saw them with his own eyes. He said we make deals with them for exchange of tech/energy, so this could be where some of our kids are going. Phillip says 100,000 kids go missing per year, not counted for. Not kidnap but just disappeared.  After he gave this speech he was murdered!!!!

<p>Max spiers is a UFO specialist and researcher. He was also researching the Clinton&#39;s as well. Well, he found out too much info and he was murdered too.

Why is our govt killing off these UFO experts and witnesses?? </p>

<p>This is a great article!!!!! Must read
 <a href="http://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/sociopolitica/esp_sociopol_underground25.htm">http://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/sociopolitica/esp_sociopol_underground25.htm</a></p>

<p>Also, you need to remember the Pope met with Patriarch Kirill of Moscow earlier this year, something that hasn&#39;t happened in 1000 years, and he told Krill the end is near. At the same time Putin moved The Ark of Gabriel (Has very bad energy) from the middle east  to Antartica. What stuns me about this is, Im reading a book right now called the Islamic Anti-christ. In the  Quran their Messiah is our Anti-christ in our bible. Is the Arc of Gabriel a way to welcome the demons and antichrist on our land?</p>

<p>Islamic Antichrist <a href="http://beforeitsnews.com/prophecy/2013/12/christian-antichrist-shockingly-resembles-muslim-savior-aka-mahdi-2456972.html">http://beforeitsnews.com/prophecy/2013/12/christian-antichrist-shockingly-resembles-muslim-savior-aka-mahdi-2456972.html</a>
ARC of Gabriel <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5-yc_zcYZ0">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5-yc_zcYZ0</a></p>

<p>Ok, Now the mystery of Julian disappearance:
So, if it&#39;s true that Julian worked for the CIA and wanted help he would have to send messages to us thru code the hidden code in the wiki misspelled tweets spells out HELP HIM. Why did he send that in code? Bc  someone was watching over him even before he was captured on Oct 17?
. <a href="https://sli.mg/DBvByu">HELP HIM </a> </p>

<p>The US govt been trying to get their hands on Julian for a long time. For what? To maybe clone him? If so they would have to plan this out in great lengths. For years the US has been destroying the Ecuador economy <a href="http://www.telesurtv.net/english/news/Meet-the-Banker-Brothers-Who-Destroyed-Ecuadors-Economy-20160613-0025.html">here </a> 
The elites KNOW they get their way if they bribe you. So, they destroy Ecuador economy then bribe Ecuador to give up Julian for cash to rebuild their country. 
The Don Marshall website posted above explains the different types of clones the govt is involved with. He also explains the clones take 5 months to fully grow. I find it really fkin weird that Julian&#39;s next appearance is Feb 19. That&#39;s 4 months and 3 days after he went missing on Oct. 17 
Could it be possible the US bribed Ecuador in exchange for Julian to clone him?? He is worth more ALIVE bc the public doesn&#39;t trust mainstream media. There trust is in WIKILEAKS but majority of the people don&#39;t  trust WL without Julian being in charge. WL will fail if Julian is killed. Then the elites won&#39;t  have a platform to use to control our minds... MSM fail, WL fail if he&#39;s dead. They can&#39;t just release him bc he will rebel and run. The elites NEED Julian more then ever especially after Trump won and is threatening to drain the swamp.  They need WL to help spread their propaganda. </p>

<p>PROOF CIA IS RUNNING WL :One of the WIKILEAKS associates told us NSA and CIA are at war. NSA being the good guys. So, WL the other day RELEASES NSA Germany leaks. Like fkin kidding me? They are fkin stupid. WL is obviously ran by CIA right now bc they are taking jabs at NSA using merkels leaks who is caught throwing up NWO gang signs <a href="https://sli.mg/lHE8wf">here </a> 
A lot of people say this 4chan post is fake but I feel like it has some truth to it. That&#39;s how CIA works. They feed us truth with dis info. <a href="https://sli.mg/uwE69h">NSA VS CIA </a> </p>

<p>So, having said all that... Its a lot to take in especially with all that has been revealed in the last 3 months. Antartica has to be where the Aliens are located and experiments, such as breeding and cloning etc. go on. In the last 2 years Millionaires are FLOCKING to New Zealand (near Antartica) and underground bunkers are in high demand right now. The elites are preparing for doomsday.
 <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/joelkotkin/2016/04/22/where-millionaires-are-moving/#75789b2e7f7b">http://www.forbes.com/sites/joelkotkin/2016/04/22/where-millionaires-are-moving/#75789b2e7f7b</a></p>

<p><a href="http://www.breitbart.com/big-hollywood/2016/09/28/demand-luxury-bunkers-soars-among-fearful-l-elites/">http://www.breitbart.com/big-hollywood/2016/09/28/demand-luxury-bunkers-soars-among-fearful-l-elites/</a></p>

<p>We recently found out about pizzagate, which is extremely evil and sickening! Its a huge global pedo ring that involves all the world leaders, politicians, bankers, judges, FBI, CIA, and Hollywood and now... Aliens. WTF  This could explain the reason behind kids vanishing. Last week Turkey went nuts blowing up #pizzagate asking where their 9,000 children went. 9,000 refugees were suppose to go to Germany... but they DISAPPEARED! Yeah, put those dots together!! You can&#39;t give them cash bc wth they gonna do with it? lol Shit is barley worth anything up here in the real world. 
So, I think we all need to come together and research every end and demand answers:
1. Pedo Sex Ring/ Satanic Ritual Murders--&gt; Research location of disappearance of kids  (Example: Watch Phillip Schneider video (above) and write down where all the underground bunkers are. Theres a HUGE one under Denver airport. Maybe theres connections around that airport like the Haiti borders place across from Besta Pizza?  Tunnels under comet that lead to the ETs? #Pizzagate 
2. The ET and Antartica, Who&#39;s all connected and I think the Pope calls the shots lol Who&#39;s visited Antartica, how often? Secret meetings? Global warming is BS i think so meeting on global warming could actually be about the ETs?  #AlienGate 
3. Julian can either be dead or they are cloning him but we need to stay on their ass about POL #WhereisJulian
4. Go to church, Pray, stay stocked up with food, water and ammo... AND STAY AWAKE and PREPARED.. We are definitely living in the end times #Godspeed</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Weed is the key to everything. It will change your whole world. I do not recognize mine anymore and I am a completely different person. Load up an entire bowl of keef (yes, keef), lie down, and keep your eyes open. Follow the rainbow. The rainbow is key. You will see bright light, don&#39;t let it take you. Then think about every movie you have watched, every song you have heard, every book you have read. The answers are right there in plain sight. Really listen to music, read the song titles, read titles of TV shows, titles of book chapters. Keep digging, and never stop asking questions. The world is slowly waking up. Do NOT do it alone. You will need help coming down. If you go too far, you won&#39;t come back. Suicide will tempt you. Do not fall for it. You need love to stay grounded. Love is the final key, it will keep you grounded. Once you are no longer blinded by colors and symbols, you will see them for what they really are, just distractions and control mechanisms. Stay safe, good vibes.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not going to lie some may not understand what your theory is but I do. See ppl think those who smoke weed are dumb pot heads. Though there are a few. But there are some people who have done what you said(I didn&#39;t see a rainbow) however I began to relax and think about all types of Viceland documentary episodes and different books and life events and I saw things different. Reality can fuck you up if your weak minded. Just like they say going on the deep web can cause all types of psychological impairments due to the shit you see which is really fuxed up and shows you how sick people are with certain acts they commit. Smoking weed , relaxing and opening your chakras can fux you up when you see reality if your not ready to receive the truth. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah I think she did. There are still some of her youtube videos floating around online that you can find. But from what I remember, she started getting a little crazier saying the earth is hollow and everything later on. Then she said not to believe her and she made it all up.

    <div class="md"><p>IMO There&#39;s definitely something to aliens that is a little too deep for most to handle. I&#39;m just a 22 yr old no one that had too much time to waste on meditation &amp; contact, TPTB have been actively trying to affect/ruin my life for <em>at least</em> 4 years. </p>

<p>Now I&#39;m at a point where they&#39;ve ruined relationships or created fake ones, stolen/ruined shit, torture me with frequency weapons every day for months (especially when I meditate and am between sleep/wake state when lot of paranormal stuff happens), witnessed mass shilling of new age forums, got banned from a weirdly active and new Iranian spirituality forum that advertises demon summoning and drugs too much only for recommending a good book, showed me an eye of horus when I closed my eyes before they controlled my heart rate for 2 days, eye movement, speech, tone and showed me a virtual reality dream of being tied and stabbed in the throat, scared half to death and woken twice by entity sounds or tech, sexually stimulated and forced to cry like pushing a button, told with voice of god tech I was abducted 17 times, an agent &quot;James&quot; told me with voice to skull I was cloned, contacted couple aliens and I&#39;m gangstalked often in fking Iran. So please try and understand why I <em>waste</em> my time on this shit. </p>

<p>Just to add to it, all the incoming &quot;you&#39;re psycho&quot; comments are part of the targeting process and many TIs (targeted individuals) when telling the police or doctors of their harassment get sent to psych wards and/or get diagnosed wrong, some very severely. It&#39;s like MK-Ultra for everyone basically.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This connects with PIZZAGATE. lol I research PIZZAGATE everyday and was one of the first to break the pizza codes 2 months ago. All we are doing is connecting the dots. 
Like how the hell does 800,000 kids go missing a year?? That a hella lot of kids!! It would make sense if they abducted those kids for comet pizza, politicians, sex island, and Antarctica for the aliens. 
No one is forgetting about pizzagate. I promise but there&#39;s a bigger picture to this. Even FBI anon told us that. He said don&#39;t just focus on comet ping pong. This is global on a WAY BIGGER SCALE. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Your 800,000 per year figure is highly misleading. For a start it&#39;s based on data that is 14 years out of date, and since the advent of mobile phones the number of reported missing people is falling year on year. Furthermore of the 800,000 in the original study about half of them turned up after a relatively short time (mere hours). And furthermore a further 200,000 were abducted by family members (like divorced parents for example) and were not lost. And a further 60,000 were abducted by people known to the child but not family members (also returned and not lost)</p>

<p>The real data shows that for children that are reported missing to local police forces only about 1 in 10,000 are not found alive. So please, fuck off with your highly misleading figures </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ok, but that article says 200,000 of those were abducted by family members. And the article says nothing about how those cases ended. Included in the remaining 600,000 are all the kids who ran away from home only to return sometime later, or any child found dead. It makes no mention of how many cases are unsolved.</p>

<p>EDIT: 33k children currently missing in the US right now. That&#39;s a lower proportion of the population than i initially calculated. And i would assume many cases are quite old. <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation-now/2014/09/23/missing-persons-children-numbers/16110709/">http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation-now/2014/09/23/missing-persons-children-numbers/16110709/</a></p>

<p>Imagine this! We already know the ROTHSCHILDS are greedy afff and only care about theirselves. If they found the other side has greater technology, energy etc they would sell us out in a heart beat!! 
One of the OP sent me this. <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rothschild_Island">Rothschild Island </a> 
We know they are basically the family that owns the world and have the most control. So they would have the best spot on Antarctica. That island is the tip of Antarctica, which means our world could be flat and the ROTHSCHILDs island is the key to the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/shared?ci=dd-rgWZK3dc">OTHERSIDE</a> </p>

<p>The Globe was made to enslave the human race to this world only. The globalist made up the term called GLOBE. If the world was <a href="https://sli.mg/QtZOam">FLAT</a> explorers like we are would try to see what is on the other side. 
Then telling us this is a globe, that would keep us away from  the edge from finding out what is on he other side. 
There&#39;s a reason why Antarctica is under heavy protect by military... </p>

Another loosely related event that preceeded the meet up was an accident in Saudi where a crane had fallen and something was uncovered from that accident. 
I actually read that here on this sub....its interesting that there is an actual chronological order that is very fluid.
And for the fact kerry is there during the final weeks of potus election shows something is definitely going on in Antarctica </p>

The countries all came to an agreement to pass a ban of fishing around Antarctica. I think they did this to lower traffic down to a min. 
Also, Buzz Aldrin visited Antarctica recently and media blasted out that he was rushed to the hospital due to the harsh conditions in Antarctica. <a href="https://www.google.com/amp/amp.timeinc.net/time/4587138/buzz-aldrin-south-pole-evacuation/%3Fsource%3Ddam?client=safari">here</a> something tells me that this is a hoax and hopefully it would turn away people from visiting. I don&#39;t think they can come out and ban everyone from visiting but they can do certain things to minimize traffic. </p>

<p>Here are the many suspicious deaths that happened in Antarctica. <a href="http://listverse.com/2015/09/25/10-strange-and-notable-antarctic-fatalities/">here </a> </p>

<p>Need I tell you more?</p>

<p>Well, let me;</p>

<p>You are all being trolled. Big time. These guys ENTERTAIN you - and thereby &quot;Remote Control&quot; you. YOU are the fucking Quantum Computers and Robots they always talk about - THEY are the &quot;Aliens&quot;.</p>

<p>-It is the oldest plan of them all. And it has always worked - they stay in the shadows, and make up stories - and while you try to figure out what is real and what i not, they go on pursuing the end goal of Global Domination - which <strong>used</strong> to be &quot;Control of The Mind&quot; (still is - they fill your head with THEM and not yourself - hence &quot;The Infection&quot;, and y&#39;all being Generation Z.... GET IT?) - but unfortunately - now it is much worse;</p>

<p>-They blast the sky with heavy metals, and poison you all through food and water, vaccines and generally fuck up your genes, so you, &amp; our CHILDREN (it&#39;s always been about the children - ALWAYS) will be under yet another layer of control.</p>

<p>-And just like you, as parents, they will have severe difficulty escaping from it, because you never figured out what was really going on - so they won&#39;t either - and they will grow up, just like you, to think Government is supposed to be there in the first place - IT IS NOT.</p>

<p>-There you have it in a nutshell.</p>

<p>Governement literally means &quot;Governance of the Mind&quot;, and THAT is what Governement <em>is</em>, <em>means</em>, and always have been: <strong>Mind Control</strong>. </p>

<p>I&#39;ll let <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8frC6sjrBPA">Mark Passio</a> break it down.</p>

<p>The Podesta e-mails is just the latest version of this hypocrisy - you all sit on your asses, and nothing gets done - because you are not IN the world, making a change.</p>

<p>The Western Civliization does not function without the minds of the hosts it has created - YOU, (&amp; everyone you know).</p>

<p>It is not &quot;Who done it&quot;, but WHAT. Look around you - the planet is being FUCKED, because YOU are not there taking care of it, nor it&#39;s inhabitants. Because you are busy pointing fingers at the assholes - but what you don&#39;t see, is that the assholes are pointing at YOU.</p>

<hr/>

<p>Forgive me for ranting, but the worst part is, I am not mad at any of you - so don&#39;t get me wrong - just take a look at what you are doing right now - are you making this planet a better place or not? Seriously - are you taking the proper management of Governing you own minds? Or are you being led by some mysterious men releasing all this marvelous Revelations so you can all be free?</p>

<p><em>What is fiction vs non-fiction in this book?
People are supposed to go along for the ride. Some of the themes that are in this book are going to play out over a series of books so they can understand the deeper issues and the deeper thought processes that have gone into the things that we did. I don’t need people to wonder what is fiction or not in this first book. I need them to absorb the story and follow along.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>I recommend everyone to be careful about the e-mails, and the book.</p>

<p>It is another attempt at confusing y&#39;all.</p>

<p>The &quot;Agenda&quot; is, and always has been to render people perplexed and helpless. The Alien Agenda is just this.</p>

<p>It is the latest attempt to make you feel so little and small, that you need the Government to make decisions for you.</p>

<p>Look at it this way: They don&#39;t give you evidence - only mysterious hints.</p>

<p>They gladly provide you circumstantial evidence, and YOU either go into the trap, or not. </p>

<p>This way their hands (again) are completely free of blood, because they have done nothing wrong - YOU are responsible for fucking up your own head - and no-one else.</p>

<p>On another note: The Matrix everyone is talking about: It has a tunnel in the end, in the bottom of the Rabbit Hole;</p>

<p>-This is it. The Podesta e-mails is the latest version.</p>

<p>And yet again, it&#39;s the aliens. Sure, may be, or may not be - but you have been warned. It is impossible to prove - and yet again, if you go for it, you are at the whims of something and someone else, and are not your own creation. </p>

<p>This place is way more engaging for my brain than anything other activities this time of night, so I figured no harm no foul. But you are right, I see some users seem to get really spun out on some of this stuff. And who knows maybe they are right and I am wrong, I have no idea. 
What I do know is that I learn about so many things here that I would otherwise never hear of, so that&#39;s what keeps me coming back. And I really do have fun trying to figure things out. I would love to be a real life Columbo, I think I missed my true calling. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I noticed he is doing the &quot;V&quot; for Vril with his fingers.  Do you think that Vril aliens have experimented enough with human dna that they have managed to create believable human chimeras?  That they have infiltrated our culture, and although technically smart, not culturally humanly smart?  Hence the mistakes they often make?  Or even used DNA from former idols (Egyptian mummies, DNA banks) to recreate humans that were once loved in order to infiltrate properly?</p>

<p>In Leah Rimini&#39;s recent Scientology show on A&amp;amp;E they said that everyone around Tom Cruise had to be a Scientologist, his cleaning lady, his chef, they even tried to plant his love interests in all the while knowing they were all part of the church.  If the Vril were trying to infiltrate and manipulate us, wouldn&#39;t they want everyone around us to also be Vril?  So our tv idols, philosophers, religious idols, authors, musicians, schools...</p>

<p>Also, the Zionist Jews are the head of all this. They are the SATANIC Bloodline (13 Bloodlines) which Hitler says they live in the inside the earth from the openings of the N/S poles. Check it out, they believe in white genocide and the Jews becoming the superior race. After all that happens and the messiah is here they get 2,800 slaves. So, I&#39;m thinking some of those slaves will be the people left over after they kill off the whites and others. The rest of the slaves will be the clones.

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s not Mars. It&#39;s Planet 9. Planet 9 is still being called hypothetical by NASA, but conspiracy theories have long predicted it by calling it Nibiru. If conspiracy theories are correct, it could be where the Annunaki live. NASA is now saying they know of its existence because of the orbits of some objects in the Kuiper Belt. How the Universe Works started its new season on the Science Channel recently, and they did the 1st show on this Planet 9. They even mentioned the possibility of life saying that while the planet lives in darkness, the core could be warm enough to host life. If you look at the meaning of the word Annunaki, they were chthonic deities, chthonic meaning &quot;in, under, or beneath the earth&quot;. They were deities of the underworld. This Planet 9 theoretically has an extreme oblong orbit, according to NASA, and according to conspiracy theories, Nibiru is coming in closely to Earth, which it does every 3600 years. Theories say when Planet 9/Nibiru comes in to the inner solar system, it causes catastrophic events, such as, earthquakes and the changing of Earth&#39;s axis. NASA is saying Planet 9 is 10 times the mass of Earth. It throws off the gravitational pull of every object, and it is doing so to objects in the Kuiper Belt right now. Conspiracy theory has attributed the extinction of the dinosaurs to Nibiru, which actually makes perfect sense. Jupiter is our protector and bodyguard from objects being flung into the inner solar system from the Kuiper Belt. When these asteroids and comets zoom in, the gravitational pull of Jupiter flings them back out, saving us from intense impacts, but if Planet9/Nibiru changed the gravity and orbits of everything in our solar system, then it&#39;s highly possible for an impact like one that led to the extinction of over 70% of life in the last great extinction. Scientists today are saying we are going through another great extinction right now. Dots are connecting. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, polar space launch because aside from the difficulty of handling launch equipment under those conditions it also the least favorable launch location owing to very little assist from earth rotation...</p>

<p>...so you claim the rich are escaping earth from a site where current launch apparatus cannot function, where it&#39;s hard to deliver fuel and supplies, where any launch would need tons of fuel because of the unfavorable latitude, to a destination that does not exist because we have not yet developed the technology for long term space inhabitance or interplanetary transit without massive health effects. </p>

<p>Going to label this one as plausible. </p>

<p>Edit: before anyone mentions nuke subs with ballistic launches from under ice in arctic, those are small payloads without achieving escape velocity, launched from subs that show up fueled, ready and with climate control on board. A bit different from erecting a man rated launch system in sub zero weather, amid blizzards. Also it&#39;s not like the scientists at Amundsen Scott who are largely liberal geogolgists and meteorologist wouldn&#39;t notice large scale military proceedings or the scientists and tourists studying penguins and plankton wouldn&#39;t notice either.</p>

Also, the first of November is when warnings of Terrorist attacks in the US and the The guy who tried to attack Trump during a rally. These incidents were distractions from what was really going on. The media focused all their attention on these incidents and didn&#39;t report on how John Kerry was visiting Antarctica and how all the country leaders signed a 35 year ban fishing treaty in Antarctica.

<p>Only thing I will add from checking the links is that this:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>On oct 28 all the counties that have rights to Antarctica signed a ban on Antarctica treaty for the next 35 years. In order to visit Antarctica you have to get permission from your govt... basically the elites. They say we are trying to save the Chilean sea bass. I call bullshit <a href="http://thediplomat.com/2016/11/a-pyrrhic-victory-in-antarctica/">http://thediplomat.com/2016/11/a-pyrrhic-victory-in-antarctica/</a></p>

<p>looks to be no more than a fishing ban - you can still visit.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I stumbled across those emails, too, when looking for terms that fbianon dropped as hints.  My gut tells me there is something to them.  I don&#39;t have the technical skills to unravel what all the photos mean, if they contain embedded info, etc.  At the time, I tried starting up my own thread about it but it got nowhere.  On the face of it, I theorized Podesta might have had some association with Peggy Shue (when I inquired about the emails in Chinese the most anyone offered was that Podesta was in contact with a chinese woman who worked at Apple).</p>

<p>I will say this....I am certain someone close to the podesta emails was dropping hints on t_d about &quot;to the stars&quot; (production company), tom delonge, etc, before they were publicly released.  At bare minimum, it means someone wanted this info to be discovered.  The question is why? and who?</p>

(Interesting read but I&#39;m taking everything with a grain of salt.  After all, what&#39;s real?  What&#39;s a psyop?)  Anyway he states over and over that Wikileaks is a creation of the CIA.  He also said JA and Wikileaks are lying low for the time being and will re-emerge and get back to work when Trump becomes president, contradicting a thread on 4chan by another legit-sounding insider anon who claimed that JA was killed on 16 October.  Anyway the claims and/or spin of this anon--the first one I mentioned--the self-described &quot;High Level Insider&quot; do seem to fit your theory that JA Mark 2 will be a 100% controlled clone (which is a pretty disturbing prospect tbh.)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>John Kerry flew to New Zealand first before heading to Antarctica. When he was in NZ there was a massive earthquake and many articles state the &quot;Guardians&quot; of Antarctica caused those quakes as a warning to America  not to interfere with their research. Who the hell are the guardians? Lol
Also, Russia released a video about what is going on in Antarctica in 2006. I haven&#39;t watched it yet, it&#39;s 45 mins long. It seems like Putin mixes more TRUTH with propaganda whereas America and U.K. Always keeps it 100% propaganda.

<p>edit: Best place for a summary if you don&#39;t have an hour is from 3:44 to about 5:17.  Brooks Agnew describes how he was using radio-frequencies to find oil in the ground with only a 30W instrument - by bouncing waves off the ground, you could find different ecological hotspots by listening to the frequency particular layers of the earth gives off.  Now just imagine doing that with one <em>billion</em> (with a B) watts, which is what HAARP does, effectively creating earthquakes and other severe weather events by bouncing these frequencies off the ionosphere and back to earth.</p>

Check this out. <a href="http://www.geoengineeringwatch.org/haarp-engineering-frankenstorm-hurricane-sandy-caught-on-satellite-and-radar/">check this out </a> </p>

<p>They say  haarp caused the BP oil spill. Theories are they were testing the machine in waters on the Madrid fault line. The haarp heats up the water which starts the quake.  If they turn the  haarp on full blast right on the Madrid fault line... it will divide the country right in half. People say the bp spill was just a warm up. </p>

What evidence do you have of Nibiru? I researched that last year and ended up thinking it was a hoax but here recently I&#39;ve heard it being thrown around again. 
I always thought Obama is gonna declare martial law somehow. He has passed some Crazy ass executive orders during his terms relating to martial law. I&#39;m already stocked up with food, water and ammo ha man, I bet that&#39;s what their doing with the children! I wonder if there is some way we can track flights going to Antarctica or even do some digging in New Zealand? I know this is all about to happen soon bc they already brainwashed the upcoming generation. 
Check out what Kellogg factories are up too. They have UN trucks and containers in their parking lots.

    <div class="md"><p>I know you guys will find it. I also very much suspect the whole pizzagate thing is orchestrated by the Illuminati-ETI. I noticed this when Anthony Weiner was pictured next to a baby before the scandal broke out. Pizzagate and many FF events are orchestrated by ETI to tap our emotions. I think they have transcended strife and now like to feed on our emotions.  They admire us in this way. I know they certainly feed on mine! But the feeling is mutual love.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you take a look at my blog, you will see in the last post that since the age of 16 I use the word ALL as a name for God, which is a Buddhist notion that God encompasses everything. Now take a look at James Alefantis again. J&#39;aime is &#39;I love&#39; in French, All is God, enfant is child (one letter is missing), and &#39;is&#39; at the end is a conjugation of the verb to be... and a punctuating affirmation of the statement. I love God&#39;s child, is. I feel the stylized presentation in the Comet Instagram posts is very much part of a religious Satanic cult. They are trying to show off with blind religious conviction. Now, if you go into the blog I linked to, you will see many puzzles like this, which eerily track events I am experiencing.. since over two decades. It adds up, exponentially. </p>

<p>In the Quran their messiah is identical to our antichrist in the Bible. So when the antichrist comes back the Muslims are going to think it&#39;s their messiah.

    <div class="md"><p>I want to write a much more in depth summary when I get the chance of the information I have been researching through people such as <a href="http://divinecosmos.com">David Wilcock</a> <a href="http://spherebeingalliance.com/blog/short/intel.html">Corey Goode</a> and <a href="http://exopolitics.org">Dr Michael Salla</a> but for now this brand new write up on David Wilcock&#39;s Blog <a href="http://divinecosmos.com/start-here/davids-blog/1208-endgame-pt-1">http://divinecosmos.com/start-here/davids-blog/1208-endgame-pt-1</a> actually summarizes and links in a lot of detail Pizzagate, Wikileaks, ET&#39;s and how its linked to Antarctica and the overall shadow war going on that he has been writing about for years. The Article is very in depth and heavily sourced and will take time to read but is well worth it. Share and spread the link after reading it to educate everyone dedicated to this research. </p>

<p>Please do not jump to conclusions after reading this kind of information for the first time. We are not living in the end times, we are just at the precipice of a great change and understanding of the truth it is good to be aware and prepared but it does not help at all to fear the unknown and let that emotion distract you from what is actually happening. I say this in direct reply to the OP&#39;s ending comment.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So I looked at the emails, and 90% of them are from UFO website reps emailing Podesta. One is from someone who was born in a Japanese internment camp. One is about how John likes the x-files. Pretty tame and certainly nothing damning.</p>

<p>My favorite though, is from one concerned Canadian:
&quot;I think, and you will agree, that without our contributions, the US would not have grown the way it has. Canadians own Hollywood, New York, Florida, the Stanley Cup and by right, the Pennant that was stolen from us due to the baseball strike.
...
Now we want to know if we are going to be dealt a hand at the table or will
we be left out like last time?</p>

<p>I represent a Canadian organization that doesn&#39;t exist that looks like DARPA, but works with the government to pursue positive growth business.
...
We don&#39;t have to let the US win the cup or the pennant and we certainly
don&#39;t have to keep our currency artificially deflated to satisfy US ego.</p>

<p>We can also cut our own deals with these alien visitors/landed martians.</p>

<p>But we won&#39;t engage them unless the US denies us access privileges and full
debriefing.&quot;</p>

<p>Be careful or Canada will take back the Stanley Cup!</p>

He is a scientist on something called SCAR or scientific committee on Antarctic researcher.

<p>Idk if anyone wants to go through it and look for anything unusual but it&#39;s a lot of reading that I don&#39;t have time for right now.

    <div class="md"><p>Meh. This is just a precursor narrative to a false flag alien invasion. r/conspiracy has had a spotlight on it for awhile now so what better place to piece together the supposed unearthing of a bunch of reptilian aliens than here and let the us think we figured it out on our own. Aliens have been hanging out pretty hardcore in our skies since the detonation of the first nuclear bombs on this planet. These are hyper intelligent multi-dimensional beings who understand the true unified and unconditionally loving nature of the universe. All I&#39;m saying is we should be aware enough to call BS on any supposed &quot;aliens&quot; who would seek to do us harm or actively participate in any attack against humanity. Steven Greer has been working with intelligence agencies for decades and has compiled hard evidence of the shadow government&#39;s agenda (through the use of Special Access Projects) to hoax an alien attack like the one this story would conveniently precede. Anyone interested in the subject should look into him. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thank you. I&#39;m starting to believe global warming is a red herring from what&#39;s really going on, which is Planet 9/Nibiru&#39;s orbit is making its way back into the inner solar system. NASA is now confirming there is a planet in the far reaches of our solar system. They say they haven&#39;t discovered it, yet, but the orbital data of some objects in the Kuiper Belt would only be possible if there was a massive planet out there. According to conspiracy theory, Nibiru orbits in close to earth every 3600 years. Some conspiracy claims that we will collide, but I don&#39;t believe that much. What will happen is this planet will cause the gravitational pull of everything to change. It can change the Earth&#39;s axis. They say it causes earthquakes. As it stands now, Jupiter is our protector and bodyguard. When objects come zooming in from the Kuiper Belt into our inner solar system, Jupiter&#39;s gravitational pull flings them back out. Without Jupiter&#39;s gravity, we would get pelted over and over again, which has happened to Earth in the past. If this planet is coming in close, changing the gravitational pull of everything around us, then Jupiter will no longer be able to protect us. There is a 99.999% chance of Earth being hit. There&#39;s much more to this, such as, the Annunaki, but I am now starting to believe the Sweet Meteor of Death might actually hold some merit. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You would know what would help a lot more than endless rambling speculation over aliens and the Pope that, like most conspiracy threads here, leads nowhere and often derives from questionable sources?  Figuring out the following:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Seeing if we can test these pictures for signs they have steganographically encoded information.  What programs can detect evidence of such manipulation?</p></li>
<li><p>Trying various steganography packages with possible keys.  There are no guarantees here but if Podesta used a key like p@ssw0rd for his email account password, there is a distinct possibility he used a key that might be guessed from his background or else brute forced.  Also, various long keys keep cropping up on the web on places like Keith Olbermann&#39;s twitter account from people with accounts indicating some claimed affiliation with Anonymous.  They don&#39;t seem to open the insurance files.  Maybe they are steganography keys.  I think there was a thread giving a bunch of these keys at one of the chans (an endchan Wikileaks thread possibly?).  Might be worth hunting for.</p></li>
<li><p>Searching for signs of more simple manipulation with a hex editor.  Example: looking for standard header/footer information for various file formats in these images.  This is a long shot but it&#39;s the easiest thing to test.</p></li>
<li><p>Weren&#39;t an &quot;owl flag&quot; and some weird script image already recovered from a couple previous Podesta image attachments?  Whatever method was used to obtain those images should be applied to these.  Anyone know the details?</p></li>
</ol>

<p>My programming is very rusty and my knowledge of steganography and steganalysis tools is minimal.  We need people with skills in this area.</p>

<p>I have always been edgy about the &quot;reality&quot; of the world&#39;s economics, politics and religion; as I try to be an informed, doubtful individual. </p>

<p>Please do not stop reading!</p>

<p>I remember, being a teen, hanging around totse A LOT. 
I would devour their articles on misinformation tactics.. basically devoured fringe and conspiracy. </p>

<p>I had just remembered reading something on totse from that time ago. I am unable to find it, since it&#39; s been a good  15 years or something like that. </p>

<p>It was an article about the new world order, etc, etc..
And how New Zealand had something to do with Zion... 
And Holograms.. And Alien bases. </p>

<p>This dates WAAAAAAAAY back. So if there is a past connection showing up today it sure would be a cool lead to follow. </p>

<p>I am unable to find it, though I had googled a lot. 
All I can find is about how great New Zealand hologram industry goes. </p>

<p>If someone out there  was a fellow totsean lurker, well they can point us into it. Or someone with better google skills. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>If searching on the sender of the antarctic pics, there are a ton of emails with random images / power point -- I think there is something encoded in the images (stenography as used in other Podesta emails and proven.) The images seem to be easily found publicly, so they appear to be grabbed, encoded (probably just a couple), then sent. Extracting all images from all sources would be the challenge and then parsing for encoded content (probably will standout based on file size relative to other photos.)</p>

<p>But by all means, continue probing whether or not Julian Assange is being secretly cloned on a covert CIA substation in the heart of antartica.  Clearly there is some next level black ops going on here.  God knows John Kerry, Buzz Aldrin, and the nazis can&#39;t all be wrong.  </p>

<p>Hey original OP, have you considered that global warming is actually a false flag to induce the public into decreasing carbon emissions, thereby kicking off a new ice age? Think about it.  A NWO of arctic elites harvesting the offspring of the human race for their perverse pedophile cloning experiments.  </p>

<p>But can we go deeper?  Consider this: George R.R. Martin has been conducting a psyop through the corrupt HBO propaganda machine this whole time.  </p>

So, it&#39;s highly possible these global warming meetings were nothing about climate. The politicians travel all the time to discus &quot;Global warming&quot; </p>

Also, the first of November is when warnings of Terrorist attacks in the US and the The guy who tried to attack Trump during a rally. These incidents were distractions from what was really going on. The media focused all their attention on these incidents and didn&#39;t report on how John Kerry was visiting Antarctica and how all the country leaders signed a 35 year ban fishing treaty in Antarctica.
