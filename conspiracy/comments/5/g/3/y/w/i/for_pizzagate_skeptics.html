        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Long post here but I&#39;m earnest in my hope that pizzagate skeptics will give it a read and comment.   There needs to be an actual debate rather than just snarky dismissals.   The media isn&#39;t doing its job.   They keep going on about &quot;conspiracy theorists&quot; and &quot;alt-right Trump supporters&quot; while failing to mention any of the relevant information.   That alone is suspicious to me.     </p>

<p>Please feel free to post this on skeptic boards.   </p>

<p>I really don&#39;t want to believe in Pizzagate.   Perhaps you can convince me I shouldn&#39;t.   </p>

<p>I think there is too much pedo hysteria in general.   It&#39;s tragic that men no longer want to work with children.   Unlike, say, the relative lack of women in STEM (science doesn&#39;t care what gender you are) the lack of men in teaching creates real life harm.   Children need both male and female role models, especially at a time when so many mothers are single.   Social scientists are increasingly becoming aware of just how <a href="http://msutoday.msu.edu/news/2016/dads-play-key-role-in-child-development/">crucial</a> men are to early childhood development.    I&#39;m not sure what the solution is but clearly something needs to be done.   Anyway, long and short is that I&#39;m not remotely interested in spreading false news about pedophilia.   </p>

<p>I don&#39;t support either the Democrats or Republicans, so I don&#39;t have a dog in this fight.  Actually, from what I gather most Pizzagate researchers believe this to be a bipartisan scandal.   </p>

<p>I also take false accusations very seriously.   It would horrify to me learn that I was engaged in a witch hunt.   I support the Men&#39;s Rights Movement&#39;s attempts to draw attention to the plight of men falsely accused of sexual crimes.   </p>

<p>One thing we know for certain: there are elite pedo rings currently operating in the United States.   Pedophiles make up at least 4 percent of the population, and billionaires are not excluded from that statistic.   </p>

<p>Another thing we can say with reasonable certainty: high ranking individuals in intelligence agencies are aware of these rings and probably using them for blackmail purposes.    A more horrifying possibility is that pedophiles are deliberately being placed in power because they are compromised.   </p>

<p><strong>Bad arguments against Pizza Gate</strong>: </p>

<ul>
<li><p><em>It&#39;s a &quot;conspiracy theory&quot; and can therefore be dismissed.</em>  Apparently the corporate media thinks this is an actual argument.  It isn&#39;t.  </p></li>
<li><p><em>Snopes said it isn&#39;t true.</em>   See above.   </p></li>
<li><p><em>Pizzagate is made up of alt right Trump supporters who hate Hillary Clinton.</em>   This is obviously true in some cases, but based on my reading of the Voat forum there are plenty of left wing people involved as well.   </p></li>
<li><p><em>if it were true the perps would have been busted.</em>   Unfortunately past cases involving elite pedo rings, whether the Fraklin Coverup, the Dutroux Affair, Jimmy Saville etc. display a clear pattern of LEO&#39;s covering up for the perps.   Why they do this is uncertain.   Some of them may be involved.   Blackmail may be an issue (there is widespread suspicion that elite pedo rings are run by intelligence agencies).   Some LEO&#39;s may fear for their lives or those of their families.  </p></li>
<li><p><em>There are too many women being singled out for this to be plausible.  Pedophilia is a male thing.</em>   This is a myth.   Some studies have the percentage of female pedophiles as high as 40%.  </p></li>
<li><p><em>Parents and grandparents wouldn&#39;t pimp out their own offspring.</em>   Another myth.   Unfortunately busts of low level pedo rings show people doing exactly that.  </p></li>
<li><p><em>Politicians are fine upstanding people.</em>   I only include this argument because it&#39;s a common one for X politician of choice.   &quot;Trump&#39;s a good man!&quot;   &quot;Obama&#39;s a good man!&quot;   These are emotional arguments.   People project their own value systems onto their rulers.   This is unwise, since according to Dr. Robert Hare, the world&#39;s leading expert on psychopathy, politicians and business leaders are significantly more likely to be psychopaths than the rest of the population.  </p></li>
<li><p><em>We have no witnesses.  Someone would have spoken out.</em>   Pedo rings are often busted by computer divisions in LE.   Oftentimes none of the children will have said a word.  Pedophiles tend to be quite good at ensuring silence through shame and fear.    This is especially true of powerful pedophiles.   Nor is it outside the realm of possibility that some of these children are being killed.   It&#39;s a terrifying thought, but we&#39;re talking about people who have no problem killing millions in unnecessary wars of aggression.   </p></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Coincidences all?</strong>  </p>

<p>I don&#39;t necessarily agree with the following arguments but for the sake of narrowing things down I&#39;ll pretend as though I do: </p>

<ul>
<li><p>The pedo symbols on the two businesses next to and across from comet, one of which works with &quot;at risk youth&quot;, are a coincidence.   </p></li>
<li><p>The night performances usually just involve adults and teens.  </p></li>
<li><p>Sasha Lord working with &quot;at risk&quot; girls in juvenile detention is a coincidence. </p></li>
<li><p>The painting, now removed, of a guy jizzing while playing ping pong with an alien and the words &quot;Shut up and Fuck&quot; was inappropriate for an all ages establishment, but these guys are just sex crazed, not pedophiles.   </p></li>
<li><p>Having a sleepover at a pizza restaurant involving both children and adults isn&#39;t that unusual (?)  It&#39;s a community place.  </p></li>
<li><p>Tony Podesta&#39;s art collection, which specializes in images of children, babies, abused children, dead children, cannibalism, pigs, pig-human hybrids, and photographs of naked kids is admittedly bizarre but he just has really strange taste.   </p></li>
<li><p>John Podesta, who has a picture portraying cannibalism in his office, and used to have an image of a butchered pig as his screensaver before colleagues demanded he remove it, views cannibalism as a metaphor.   He&#39;s not an actual cannibal (duh).  Also, the fact that he lovingly describes his job during college of butchering pigs may imply that he is a psychopath, but not all psychopaths are pedophiles or cannibals.  </p></li>
<li><p>Marina Abramovic, whose &quot;art&quot; revolves around satanism, pedophilia and cannibalism, is just an attention whore.   Shock art is her gimmick.   </p></li>
<li><p>It is a coincidence that the painter Scott G. Brooks, <a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1455634">associated</a> with the Comet crew, paints <a href="https://theartstack.com/artist/scott-g-brooks/monsters-medicine-2011">pictures</a> of babies and toddlers and half-pig-half human babies and toddlers being tortured, sexually abused, and fed excrement [warning NSFL]</p></li>
<li><p>Tony&#39;s close life long friendship with pedophile &quot;Denny&quot; Hastert is a coincidence.   There is no evidence that they molested kids when they taught together in Japan.   The &quot;certain unnamed island&quot; in Japan that Hastert was allegedly going to &quot;flee to&quot; after he was busted probably just referred to a getaway vacation house, not a place where he and Tony molested kids beyond the prying eyes of other teachers.      </p></li>
<li><p>The giant sub-basement Tony created in his home is for art just like he said, not anything sinister. </p></li>
<li><p>Obama moving two doors down is irrelevant.   No one suspects Obama of anything.  </p></li>
<li><p>The food references in the emails are odd but John is a foodie and especially likes pizza and hotdogs, like Obama.   You&#39;d expect lots of odd food references.   Perhaps they were talking about drugs or escorts.   </p></li>
<li><p>Amanda Kleinman, who performs at Comet and is listed first on their &quot;friends&quot; list, is fascinated by pedophilia and likes to joke about pedophilia and reference it in her music videos to provoke people.   Her music video &quot;Neutered Noel&quot;, which features images of Chuck E cheese, pizza and pizza related images intercut with babies, children, puppies, babies wearing pizza outfits and a baby wearing a &quot;sugar babies&quot; outfit intercut with images of rape and sexual torture is an example of this.   </p></li>
<li><p>That woman investigating the Clinton Foundation and child trafficking in Haiti committed suicide because she was depressed.   She was not murdered.   The same is true of all those past associates of Hillary who committed suicide.   Hillary has that effect on people.   </p></li>
</ul>

<p>Okay.  So as you can see by my not-so-subtle sarcasm I&#39;m not entirely convinced by all of the above arguments.   However, believe it or not, I&#39;m still willing to entertain the notion that these are all coincides.   I mean, fantastical coincides do happen in life.    </p>

<p><strong>Here&#39;s what I&#39;m having a hard time getting past:</strong> </p>

<ul>
<li><p><em>Jimmy&#39;s Instagram</em>.   This is what got everyone interested, yet the media refuses to even quote Mr. Alefantis in their &quot;debunking&quot; articles.   So far the only explanation I&#39;ve seen from Pizzagate skeptics is that they were all engaging in &quot;dark humor.&quot;   This doesn&#39;t make sense to me.   I have a dark sense of humor.   I&#39;ve laughed at pedophile jokes.   But these are pictures of real children who are known to the people in question.   It would never occur to me in a million years to make a pedophilic joke if a relative sent me a picture of his child.   Yet here are these people doing it not once but multiple times.   &quot;Chickenlovers,&quot; &quot;Hotard,&quot; &quot;Why does daddy like it in the butt,&quot; &quot;Gay baby&quot;, Baby for sale -- &quot;don&#39;t touch&quot;, &quot;Yum…baby&quot; etc.   I also find the non-sexual comments strangely objectifying.   People not using the children&#39;s names but saying things like &quot;Ginger!&quot; (red haired baby), &quot;That&#39;s a she baby not a he baby&quot; etc.   Who the fuck talks like this?   </p></li>
<li><p><em>That fucking mole on Tony&#39;s forehead.</em>   The police sketches of the two suspects in the abduction of Maddie McCan do not roughly resemble the Podesta brothers -- they are an exact fit.   Right down to the mole on Tony&#39;s forehead.   Long before Pizzagate broke, Maddie&#39;s parents were suspected of being complicit in the disappearance/murder.    While it would be absurd to imagine the Podestas creeping around a rich neighborhood abducting kids, their presence would make sense if the parents or someone close to the parents were part of an elite pedo ring.   Apparently they were already into swinging and BDSM.   Perhaps something went wrong during the night&#39;s &quot;entertainment.&quot;   Another &quot;coincidence&quot;: John deleted his emails the exact date she disappeared.   </p></li>
<li><p><em>Tamera Luzzatto referring to &quot;raw and uncut&quot; time with a toddler.</em>   Luzzatto was Hillary&#39;s chief of staff.  She and her husband were referred to in an article as the &quot;real life Underwoods&quot; from House of Cards, implying a Machiavellian and psychopathic bent.   In one of the emails about a pool party, she refers to three kids as &quot;entertainment&quot; and mentions their specific ages.   I was willing to dismiss that as the ravings of an old crazy lady who has a weird way of talking about kids, but I&#39;m having a very difficult time understanding &quot;raw and uncut&quot; outside of a sexual context.  </p></li>
<li><p><em>Cumulative evidence.</em>    Any single fact about PizzaGate, if viewed in isolation, would be eyebrow-raising but not enough to suggest anything sinister.   But when all of it is viewed together, it does paint a picture, does it not?   Are people really &quot;crazy&quot; for thinking this warrants investigation?</p></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Edit</strong>: I should also point out that at this point, Pizzagate is no longer just about the Podestas, the Clinton Foundation and Comet Pizza.   People are pursuing a lot of interesting leads.    One of the really disturbing things so far revealed is that an abnormally large number of groups specializing in work with &quot;at risk&quot; youth and child trafficking have pedo symbols for their logos and links to sketchy individuals (naturally people are also drawing unwarranted conclusions and seeing stuff that isn&#39;t there).   At minimum that should evoke concern.    </p>

<p><strong>Edit 2</strong>: Two people so far have attempted to refute two of the four points I ended with.   </p>

<p>Re: Luzatto.  The statement reads, &quot;you can spend some time with her online, raw and uncut.&quot;   It has been suggested that she was proud of the baby (described as the &quot;future ruler of the world&quot;) and was offering to show people &quot;raw and uncut&quot; footage of this future leader.   Still sounds weird as hell.   Perhaps she&#39;s just gotten a little loopy in her old age?  </p>

<p>Re: Podestas and McCann.  It is claimed that the police sketches are of one person.   Others claim investigators later revised their first impression and believe multiple people were involved.  </p>

<p><strong>Edit 3</strong>: I should stress that I&#39;m not here to &quot;prove&quot; pizzagate.   I was serious when I said I would rather be proven wrong and that I take false accusations very seriously.   If people make compelling arguments I will revise my current position, which is basically <em>at least some aspects of pizzagate are real.</em>   </p>

<p><strong>Edit 4</strong>: Two posters have challenged the &quot;cumulative evidence&quot; point.   One suggests that &quot;autists&quot; are finding patterns that aren&#39;t there.   I think this is definitely true of people who think every symbol or food reference is a tell, but false on the specific points I listed, which do paint a coherent picture.   It is also claimed that people are shocked by the punk rock and gay BDSM scene.   I have found this to be true of some of the youtube Christian posters covering the story, but not for pizzagate researchers in general.   It is specifically the pedophile stuff that people are concerned about, not kinky sex.   </p>

<p>The other poster claimed that the cumulative evidence is largely based on art and innuendo.   I responded with what I think is a relevant point: if the intention of eg Abramovic and Kleinman was to shock people and engender discussion about cannibalism and the torture and rape of children through their art, they have responded to these allegations in a very odd way.   Instead of saying &quot;I wanted to provoke discussion of X, Y and Z and how pedophilia and child predators affect society etc.&quot; or even just &quot;I wanted to piss people off&quot; they have simply claimed that everything is &quot;fake news&quot; by Donald Trump supporters.   Alefantis likewise.   </p>

<p><strong>Edit 5</strong>: One poster suggested that we should stop specifically accusing these people of being pedophiles since there is no hard evidence.   I agree, but I don&#39;t see how it would be possible to enforce such a rule.   He also suggested hiring a P.I.  </p>

<p><strong>Edit 6</strong>: I think this situation would be relatively easy to resolve.   All it requires is...actual journalists.   Ask Tony about his art collection.   Why is he obsessed with pedophilia and images of children being abused?   Ask Tony where he was on the day of McCan&#39;s disappeared.   Find out if the Podestas were in Portugal.   Ask Kleinman what she was trying to convey by her music video The Neutered Noel.   Ask Abramovic about the pedophilic photography and what the intent was.   Ask Alefantis about each specific sexual reference in the Instagram photos.  </p>

<p>If there&#39;s nothing to see here, and this is nothing more than a witch hunt, why not just clear it up?   If journalists did their jobs then this matter could have been settled weeks ago.   Dismissing everything as fake news and ignoring people&#39;s concerns are only adding to the suspicion.    </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Here&#39;s my problem with the whole situation. Yes, I agree there&#39;s no hard evidence, so the conspiracy isn&#39;t 100% proven. That being said, people are dismissing it as having no basis in reality without any sort of investigation into the facts. Any sort of crime or scandal has a period where it&#39;s unproven, and that&#39;s where an investigation comes in, and the media is trying to skip that step altogether.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Exactly! The starting point is always speculation/suspicion that a crime has occurred. That&#39;s is where an investigation comes into play. The MSM waving it all away as just nonsense is very telling.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is the way I look at it:</p>

<p>The media is all very calculated. They don&#39;t write or dismiss any story without a reason, so what&#39;s the reason for dismissing this one? Surely if it was all just bullshit they would write some piece dismissing it that would address the actual facts and not just bullshit.</p>

<p>The reason (and this was communicated from the top, the people that own the media) is that they can&#39;t even get near the facts without giving up the truth.</p>

<p>There&#39;s no other reason that makes sense. If it wasn&#39;t so pervasive they would still be able to write their piece and lie. They have such a large and complicated network of lies that they can&#39;t even touch the story in a legitimate sounding way.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The way mainstream media handles &#39;against the narrative&#39; subjects like this is it creates an onion around them.</p>

<p>For example, a ridiculously obvious onion around 9/11.. We all (r/conspiracy people) know for a fact that 3 huge buildings fell - but the vast majority of Americans still think that 2 buildings fell.. And the media will continue to report that 2 buildings fell over and over.. despite the evidence and fairly common knowledge of 3 buildings falling.. in order to keep the knowledge at a minimum and confuse the issue. But, you can still find mainstream reporting of tower 7 falling so the media can say they reported it..</p>

<p>Meanwhile.. there&#39;s still tower 5 that almost no one talks about. Don&#39;t expect any reporting on that ever.</p>

<p>And this is how they keep basic facts in dispute and prevent any assembly of unity or concensus on any non narrative subject.</p>

<div class="comment mb-3 ml-5" data-depth="5" data-id="dapkn8x">
    <p class="byline text-muted mb-0"><a href="javascript:;" class="score"><span class="badge badge-secondary">18</span></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a class="author" href="../../../../../../../../user/I_Fuck_Milk.html">I_Fuck_Milk</a> 2016-12-02</p>
    <div class="md"><p>I agree that it&#39;s all just to create confusion around the subject.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s how they&#39;re handling this one (as well as some logical fallacies of their argument):</p>

<p>First they&#39;re passing off as much of this as possible as Russian propaganda (despite none of this actually coming from Russia). These intelligence agencies that are claiming the Podesta emails are from Russia are likely implicated and have a vested interest in discrediting it. </p>

<p>As soon as they get a critical mass of people and the media to parrot this narrative, they can just ignore it and act like it&#39;s all false (even if it was from Russia it could be true and would then deserve addressing). If you keep saying something enough and have enough credibility a lot of people will believe it. The problem is the media should have lost a large amount of credibility after getting the election so incredibly wrong and attacking anyone that was actually getting it right.</p>

<p>So then all the stuff they can&#39;t claim comes from Russia gets attacked with the &quot;fake news&quot; label. The problem with that is this stuff is really just facts, and you&#39;re supposed to draw your own conclusions. The media really doesn&#39;t like stories that let you draw your own conclusions, especially when they&#39;re likely not to be the ones they want.</p>

<p>These people are so caught up in their own nets of lies that they won&#39;t let the media cover the real news at all. Wikileaks hardly got any coverage. The ND protests got virtually no coverage (to the point where no one really has any idea what&#39;s happening there, on purpose), this is getting no coverage.</p>

<p>The problem of course being that too many Americans lack the ability and initiative to search for facts and draw their own conclusions critically. It&#39;s all about putting a label on the story that allows them to credibly ignore it, because the net of lies is so big that they can&#39;t touch the story without mixing up the story and giving it credibility.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That is precisely what is happening, but I think a lot of people are catching on to that narrative. They may not be talking about it on social media platforms, but they are IRL, if they feel comfortable enough to open up about it and not be mocked. Just like people did not want to admit to being a Trump supporter for fear of being labeled and mocked. The media has done serious damage to this country internally.</p>

<p>America has yet to apologize for <em>destroying</em> Sinead O&#39;Connor for saying the catholic Church was systemically covering up and moving around pedophiles guised as priests, a conspiracy organized from the very bottom of the hierarchy to the very top echelons, with the number of child victims and shuffled molestors so high it was incalculable.</p>

<p>Why? You answered me with something that I already addressed that I don&#39;t care if they are here or not, you felt the absolute need to point out &quot;durr you know they&#39;re still here right&quot; I don&#39;t care, and I seriously doubt they are, I think that CTR packed it in and counted their money once Hillary lost, because that was all it was ever about for them anyway, greed and profit. </p>

<p>The only astroturfers and whitewashers still on the site that are clearly noticeable come from r/The_Donald and the various right/alt-right propaganda sources, how about we whine about them instead amirite? Nah why bitch about r/The_Donald at all right? That just shows the bias right there.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If they can or not influence an election is irrelevant</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Obviously not if that was the whole point of concern here in r/conspiracy when the news that they were here broke, we were all so worried about them influencing the election, yet Hillary lost, so why do they still matter? and why do we still think someone is paying them when they failed to win vs. the right wing&#39;s own propaganda machine and fake news crap? </p>

<blockquote>

<p>Please don&#39;t try to act like the Right/Alt-Right isn&#39;t doing this as well, and more successfully obviously, and if you can&#39;t see this then obviously you&#39;ve been in your bubble for to long and need to start checking some sources on your own. </p>

<p>What&#39;s the phrase? Oh yeah &quot;if it&#39;s too good to be true, it probably isn&#39;t&quot; if you think that an article caters to each and every part of your bias guess what? You&#39;re the one being manipulated.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>We try with those who we feel are reasonable and with which a civil discussion can be had.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Bullshit, I&#39;ve been on this sub for five years, don&#39;t try and act like our userbase is a beacon of being reasonable, half of the time anyone gives a dissenting opinion it&#39;s downvoted to hell with no attempt to debate, just like my initial reply in this conversation was.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>A real debate you know where each person illustrate their evidence and rebuke the other&#39;s?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Are you just trying to show me you understand the concept of debating for a pat on the head? Also a debate doesn&#39;t necessarily need evidence, as long as both sides are knowledgeable on the subject, but evidence clearly helps make the case.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>CTR does not do that, they put their heads in the sand and scream LALALA at the top of their lungs while interjecting with racist, bigot, islamophobe or whatever the next hip word becomes.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Lmfao dude if that&#39;s who you think CTR is then you have no clue what CTR is/does/or would do, and besides what you described is exactly what people in this sub do as well where we scream <em>LALALA</em> at the top our lungs while injecting <em>shill, CTR, pedo, etc.</em> or whatever the next hip dehumanizing term becomes.</p>

<p>Anyway, CTR is about changing the narrative, and brigading clicks, whitewashing truth, so the idiots screaming racist, bigot, islamophobe or whatever are the run of the mill hardcore base of either the democrats in general or Clinton in particular, and honestly if they said it in regards to some asshole being a racist, a bigot, or an islamophobe they are just being a normal person calling out an idiot for being racist, a bigot, or an islamophobe, seriously man a bit of self-awareness can lead you down new corridors of life. </p>

<p>So what CTR would actually do is dispute &quot;facts&quot; and statistics with &quot;facts&quot; and statistics that would favor the person they are employed by, and they would also downvote anything negative and upvote anything positive, all of this would fall under whitewashing, the astroturfing comes in where they start feeding us bullshit articles like crap from HuffPo or the DailyKOS and other extremely biased crap like those rags, the Right-Wing version of this crap would be junk like Breitbart and RedState, and like a billion other fucking sites, if I could I&#39;d give you my filter list I have most of them blocked both Right and Left and I add more pretty much every day. </p>

<p>My final point on this is that I truly believe that CTR&#39;s main function here on Reddit was to &quot;poison the well&quot; put up a boogeyman that we couldn&#39;t pin down who is and who isn&#39;t and let our userbase turn ourselves against each other, believe me I&#39;m sure there is more to it but here we are, almost a month after the election still chasing that fucking boogeyman and attacking one another because that boogeyman helped put it in all of our heads that anyone that doesn&#39;t agree with me must be with the boogeyman, and now we have one giant sitewide confirmation bias circlejerk that is still split into two teams, meanwhile the conman heading to the whitehouse in January is laughing all the way while picking establishment and Wall St. shills the whole entire time.</p>

<p>See lmfao this is exactly what I&#39;m talking about, just because you don&#39;t see it my way instantly I&#39;m being manipulated? I actually think you are in fact the one being manipulated, see how this works, next you can say I&#39;m stupid or an idiot, but I can say the same thing because I feel the exact same way about the exact opposite shit.

<blockquote>

<p>The responses to me should barely touch on #pizzagate anyway since I was responding to the idiot claiming that &quot;the only people dismissing it are CTR hurr durr&quot; so nice deflection.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>This is such a bullshit statement that I think I can smell it through my screen, and yet it&#39;s simply another deflection. This is a political issue because you guys made it one, you guys are so desperate to have your biases confirmed that Hillary and Bill are the satanic monsters #pizzagate is painting them as, now like I said I haven&#39;t seen enough evidence to say they are, but I have seen enough to say they might be, well maybe not satanic that whole aspect smells like bullshit too, especially since it&#39;s all based on a batshit crazy modern artist. </p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>No it won&#39;t a.) because wikileaks refused, admittedly to release anything about Trump so we have no idea and b.) just about everyone digging are all Trumpbots only focused on finding Clinton shit and through their biases will most likely ignore any Trump shit, or even worse justify through mental gymnastics.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>People around the world are digging into this. From both sides.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;ll admit there are people digging into it from both sides, but the sides are hardly balanced at all, and all I&#39;ve seen so far is speculation, accusations, and harassment, and it all just echoes the Boston Bombing faux pas where someone said &quot;we found the bomber&quot; and no we didn&#39;t.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Man you sound so agressive throughout that text, take it easy man, rest a bit, the world is a scary place for all of us.</p>

<p>What you mistake for aggressiveness is actually passion, I&#39;m passionate about this stuff and going about things the right way, I&#39;m passionate about my country, I&#39;m passionate about right and wrong, and believe me man I&#39;m passionate when it comes to actually putting pedos away. </p>

<p>I have a step daughter who was molested by her grandfather on my wife&#39;s exes side of the family when she was four, luckily for that fuck he&#39;s dead and my 14 year old daughter got her ass grabbed by a fucking TA at her middle school, not once but a few times, and then it was reported and the school covered it up, so I have a legit beef with kid touchers, but it doesn&#39;t mean we should go after anyone without concrete evidence, just like I couldn&#39;t do shit legally against my kid&#39;s TA without the concrete evidence the school tried to hide in order to maintain their liability. This shit sucks but there is a process and we should be using it but #pizzagate has not tried to use the process from what I can see, they just want to find shit on the Clinton&#39;s and that is all that matters to them, until that aspect changes I&#39;ll still be combative with all of the dumbshits that want me to blindly accept bullshit.</p>

<p>&quot;&quot;You know, some people have asked us, &#39;When will you release information on Donald Trump?&#39;&quot; Assange said later. &quot;And of course we&#39;re very interested in all countries, to reveal the truth about any candidate, so people can understand, but actually it&#39;s really hard for us to release anything worse than what comes out of Donald Trump&#39;s mouth every second day. I mean, it&#39;s part of his charismatic appeal that he speaks off the cuff, but, you know, that&#39;s difficult for Donald Trump to overcome, a lot of those things, even with a lot of great material coming out by WikiLeaks and other publications.&quot;&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If that&#39;s what you&#39;re talking about then it seems you have it wrong, would love to know if it was something else though. </p>

<p>That said, people are getting way out of hand over the left/right issue. I know Youtube has never been a beacon for humanity but the <em>actual</em> racism and hate spouted there from some of those on the right is disgusting. It&#39;s all you see on some videos.<br/>
I can&#39;t stand the SJW name-calling either, but put up against those guys they kinda have a point.</p>

<p>To the whole confirmation bias thing, it&#39;s the way our minds work unfortunately. With the internet and message boards it is really, really easy to fall in to that trap too. My stance is basically anti-Hillary and ends there, I think it would be helpful for me and a lot of others if there was some effort put in to listing the shady shit Trump has been involved in - I just don&#39;t care enough to do it myself and don&#39;t want to read through overblown crap about his &#39;racist&#39; statements.</p>

<p>They infested the site so badly it caused me to question the motivation of every single post.</p>

<p>The safest thing to do IMO is to assume anyone with an opposing view to me is CTR.Its the only way to ensure that the virgins aren&#39;t influencing your opinion in the direction they want.</p>

<p>Its a bit Sad and paranoid maybe but I take hart in knowing that  they will never be able to change my mind about pizzagate and that ironically it is David Brocks fault.</p>

<p>And don&#39;t blame it on Brock, he did not force you to take that idiotic stance, you took it on your own. </p>

<p>How about engaging people and finding out why they don&#39;t believe and debate the points, if you have the mental capacity to do so, otherwise you&#39;ll just keep using the CTR crap as a crutch to get out of doing any kind of critical thinking and outside parties will continue to think this sub is retarded. </p>

</blockquote>

<p>Then why would you bother sticking up for the point then if you aren&#39;t confident in the evidence? Especially with the #pizzagate stuff, accusations of being a pedo can go a long way socially and can ruin someone&#39;s life completely, wives leave husbands, and vice versa, kids alienate from parents, employers fire the accused, but yet it&#39;s all good because once the accusation is leveled and goes viral you wash your hands of it, how would that be okay by any means?</p>

<p>I get that you didn&#39;t say you were confident, I was just trying to make a point, and I&#39;d like to think I did.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I just think this is the safest assumption.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What is the old saying about &quot;assuming&quot;? You don&#39;t level accusations like this over a fucking assumption, that&#39;s just being a shitty human being and being okay with going along with the old mob mentality.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I doesn&#39;t stop me from thinking critically or examing any evidence presented to me.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Really? Because you sound kind of biased about it already, which in turn would hinder your ability to critically think because your mind is made up already. Ergo you are not critically thinking.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I am just aware that paid propagandists are operating in sub&#39;s I frequent and want to manipulate my opinions to be more in tune with there pay masters.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes but yet you seem to think that accepting paid propaganda from one side is okay, because it confirms your beliefs, whereas you think the otherside is wrong because your accepted form of propaganda says that the other side is wrong and thus is in line with your biases. Get my point on this?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I can and will drop this attitude when I think the time is right.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Well aren&#39;t you the sassy little one.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I&#39;m not looking to win anyone over to my way of thinking or gain allies its just what I think is the best course of action at this particular time.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So are you looking to win anyone over and gain allies or are you not? That sounds very contradictory to me, you aren&#39;t looking to but it&#39;s the best course of action so that means you are? </p>

<p>Either way it doesn&#39;t matter because you should be, and if you aren&#39;t it just means that you aren&#39;t confident in the subject matter and thus your opinion shouldn&#39;t matter than, right? Because we can circlejerk about #pizzagate all we want but at some point someone has to put their big boy pants on and call bullshit or declare it as &quot;the truth&quot; we can&#39;t sit around and bitch forever because as we sit here and do it right now people that believe this conspiracy are calling in and sending death threats to the people involved, regardless of guilt, just on perception, and the longer we circlejerk about it the worse it&#39;s going to get for everyone, or the Admins will do something retarded like censoring the words &quot;pizza&quot; &quot;gate&quot; and anything else related to it sitewide, because we all saw how dumb fucking Spez could be with the editing shit from last week. </p>

<p>Dude nobody is, except for people actively working for them, and I doubt even them, so their Information and executive hierarchy are probably the only ones that would know. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>I don&#39;t really know how wide spread they are,how much they post ,where they post etc.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I am only basing things on my observations, my professional opinion from an IT perspective, and what makes sense to me. All of it is conjecture but like I said, it&#39;s my opinion, like it or not but that&#39;s the way I see it.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Pizzagate is another story.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Really? Well enlighten me, why do you think you&#39;re an expert on this subject matter? I know I&#39;m not, but why are you so certain you have it right?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I&#39;m 100% sure that Allenfantis should be investigated by the police.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Then why hasn&#39;t the evidence been forwarded to them? Why have they not acted upon it? Why are you so certain of it, I mean 100% you must have complete confidence that this person should be put away and have their life ruined, why?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>There is more than engouth evidence to be concerned for the wellbeing of children he has access to.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Like I said, why? What&#39;s the proof? Why is it not in police hands? Why is it being ignored? Why? WHy? WHY? (get my point)</p>

<p>I&#39;m just saying I don&#39;t want to hear about people&#39;s fee fees (feelings) I want the evidence, the proof, then we can debate it and either you&#39;ll convince me or you&#39;ll see where the evidence falls short.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Likewise podesta</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Podesta seems like a complete POS political hack, but outside of that like I said above, twice, evidence, not fee fees, show me.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>There is engouth evidence to suspect him of involvement in the McCann case.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>See the linking this crap to McCann is really what made me start taking a shit on #pizzagate, I studied the fuck out of that case when it was big news and I feel it&#39;s pretty obvious the parents were at fault, ala Jon Benet Ramsey. Don&#39;t get me wrong, I&#39;m not dead set on that opinion though, but it&#39;s whom I always felt was the obvious suspect.</p>

<p>The main issue I have with pulling in the McCan case is that #pizzagaters are desperately trying to <a href="http://work911.com/communication/conflictkitchen.htm">&quot;kitchen sink&quot;</a> the issue, where suddenly everything is related to #pizzagate, and the world simply doesn&#39;t work that way, and only in r/conspiracy and similar places is that even an acceptable practice of investigation.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>He should be investigated by the police to rule out any connections.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Everyone involved should be investigated by the police before they are ruled out on any of this, but the main issue most of us have about #pizzagate is that all of this should have gone to the police first, this way they can clear the innocent before we start lynching people. </p>

<p>But you guys did it ass backwards, you guys connected as many of the dots as you can, real or imagined, and then you started harassing them, threatening them, and thereby tainting any investigation the police may eventually begin. It was stupid and foolhardy, and this type of crap only harms the innocent and the potential victims, and probably has the real people behind these things, if they actually happened, on the run or covering shit up. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Investigated by the police does not mean be put away and have your life ruined,he could be innocent but at this stage an investigation is the very least that should happen.</p>

<p>The proof that a police investigation is needed is the disturbing Instagram pictures of a little girl taped to table while his friends make strange comments.</p>

<p>Pictures on the Instagram of small coffins.</p>

<p>Pictures on the Instagram of piles of cash next to a bottle of date rape drugs.</p>

<p>Pictures on Instagram of babies for sale.</p>

<p>Pictures on an Instagram of what they mockingly call the kill room.</p>

<p>That&#39;s before you bring up the weird art works that line the walls,the fact that in a recent interview he lied about having a basement and the fsact the restaurant on the same street has proven FBI pedophile symbolism as its logo.</p>

<p>On the McCann Podesta angle</p>

<p>The fact that they match the e fits to the letter,right down to the mole on Podesta&#39;s cheek combined with Podesta&#39;s connection to known paedophiles(the senator,his childhood friend,his name escapes me) is cause for alarm,especially when you relse that Podesta&#39;s mass deleted  emails the day after her disappearance.There is also an email referencing a&quot;Madeline&quot;.We know Podesta&#39;s visited Portugal a number of times via the Clinton foundation and we know he was out of the country at the time.I find it odd that no one has provided an alibi for him,it should be easy engouth to prove he wasn&#39;t in Portugal at the time.</p>

<p>The fact that these people post openly on Instagram suggests that the police and alphabet agencies would have known for a long time and did nothing,they were certainly informed at the start of the pizzagate storm,the fact they haven&#39;t acted causes people to assume that they are not going too.</p>

<p>There are many problematical with crowd sourcing what should be a police investigation, we can agree on that at least.</p>

<p>What if Rience Pre&#39;s wife had pedophillia centric posts on her Instagram? Would the media create a cover for them and refuse to report on the sexualized images of children? </p>

<p>They are doing that for David Brock&#39;s ex-lover and John Podesta&#39;s friend J. Alefantis.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t think they do. They know that the majority of Americans are too lazy, fearful, or controlled to take to the streets and demand justice. Sure, you&#39;ll have &#39;movements&#39; like Occupy, but not the kind of numbers that are required to tackle things like this.</p>

Iraq, Afghanistan, and Libya being examples of domestic insurgencies dominating larger forces...add the fact that the US has a voluntary military unwilling to fire on domestic insurgence...Every war game I can recall ends with domestic gorillas in full military control within 3 days...unless parameters were adjusted to ensure force dominance...aka, civilian oversight porn.

    <div class="md"><p>You make numerous very good points OP.  A lot of the narratives you underscore are known control grid propaganda--the adhom of &#39;conspiracy theorist&#39; being primary in this knowledge domain; secondly &#39;alt right&#39; which really doesn&#39;t exist in the way the media wants to fearscape us into believing; and thirdly the &quot;conspiracies don&#39;t happen because someone would blow the whistle&quot;--that&#39;s another thing we&#39;ve properly and formally debunked many times over (gulf of tonkin, uss liberty, safari club)  I want to add to the conversation and in doing so I&#39;m going to have to respectfully disagree at some points.  I hope that&#39;s ok with you.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Pizzagate is made up of alt right Trump supporters who hate Hillary Clinton. This is obviously true in some cases, but based on my reading of the Voat forum there are plenty of left wing people involved as well. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>There is a third option no one talks about.  It&#39;s the libertarian non-partisan person who sees Hillary Clinton as a criminal who should be in jail along with several others such as James Comey, Loretta Lynch, Huma Abedin, and possibly even Obama.  This demographic is real, it&#39;s large, and it&#39;s underrrepresented.  In fact it&#39;s ignored.  </p>

<p>Just because someone is rational and uses history and evidence to make a case about the constellated Clintonian cabal&#39;s criminality, doesn&#39;t &#39;by default&#39; make them a Trump supporter, despite &#39;shit news says&#39;. I didn&#39;t vote for anyone this year because (several reasons in fact) I didn&#39;t have a third party option on my ballot.  I didn&#39;t vote for Trump.  I support Trump less and less as I see who he fills his cabinet with (Jesuits--the usual suspects).  But just because I&#39;m helping with Pizzagate and combing through podesta emails doesn&#39;t mean I support Trump, but clearly the news is trying to force the failed left-right, binary, partisanship narrative and we shouldn&#39;t play into it anymore.  It&#39;s ternary or better, or at least we want it to be.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Some studies have the percentage of female pedophiles as high as 40%. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>That&#39;s not true, iirc it&#39;s less than 5% by the arrest numbers.  This <a href="http://theweek.com/articles/479986/pedophilia-guide-disorder">link says 6%</a>, if it&#39;s sourced I am inclined to believe it, thedailybeast agrees<sup><sup><a href="http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2011/12/06/what-science-reveals-about-pedophilia.html">[1]</a>.</sup></sup>  Wikipedia homes in on this number as well with 5, 6 up to 8%, with even more sources<sup><sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Female_child_molesters">[2]</a>.</sup></sup>  Turns out, it actually IS a male thing.  I&#39;ve read this many times from many sources.  </p>

<p>But giving you the benefit of the doubt (since it&#39;s easy to doubt the news now), I searched your 40% and I found <a href="http://www.menstuff.org/issues/byissue/pedophiles-female.html">this link</a>, whose statement is not only wholly non-believable (1 in 6 men molested), it&#39;s also not sourced.  This frustrated me.  I wanted to know where this was coming from.</p>

<p>Googling around led me finally to <a href="http://www.ipt-forensics.com/library/female.htm">this page</a>, wherein it makes the following statement:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>David Finkelhor and his colleagues (23, 24), in a national study of 270 day care cases, report that 40 percent of the perpetrators were women</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Ah.  So here is a list of <a href="http://www.unh.edu/ccrc/sexual-abuse/papers.html">Finkelhor D</a> papers.  Though the above may be accurate, keep in mind it doesn&#39;t disagree with the 6% (5-8%) of pedos are female, because this is a sample population from &quot;day cares&quot;, which would be a prime scenarios for female psychopaths to molest children, versus the myriad other contexts in which they are not molested.  Here are those papers directly</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.ncjrs.gov/pdffiles1/Digitization/113095NCJRS.pdf">Finkelhor D, Williams LM, Burns N, Kalinowski M: Sexual abuse in day care: a national study.</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.peterellis.org.nz/books/1988_david_finkelhor_nursery_crimes.pdf">Finkelhor D, Williams LM, Burns N: Nursery Crimes: Sexual Abuse in Day Care</a></li>
</ul>

<p>I win the &quot;success in googling for academic papers&quot; award today, btw. That shit is sometimes annoyingly hard.  And always remember its so because the CIA killed Aaron Swartz</p>

<hr/>

<p>You&#39;re spot on with your suspicions around pizzagate facts specifically.  You are right to be suspicious.  If you look at it from a math perspective, the statistical likelihood of these things being &#39;coincidencia in a vacuum&#39; is so low as to be impossible.  I did a thing about the number 33,000 which I found 32 times in the podesta emails.  There was no other &#39;statistic&#39; or &quot;numbers&quot; represented nearly with that frequency.  The likelihood of that being a coincidence or even those being real numbers is impossible--it&#39;s clearly spy-to-spy &quot;signalling behavior&quot; more than it is an actual real number from police reports...even if it were, its clear it would be a fudged number they plucked from the ether that had no actual scientific (as in based on real gathered reports) basis.</p>

<p>Similarly, then, when you have a person who is connected to 5 convicted pedophiles, has pedo artwork, mocks the public&#39;s sensibilities with antisocial and inappropriate pedo art and phrases like &#39;hotard&#39; and being a childless adult posting pictures of other people&#39;s children (most know that&#39;s wildly inappropriate for social media), attending other events implicated in pedophilia and &#39;unusal art exhibits that are of a sexualized nature where children were also present&#39;....it&#39;s statistically impossible that this person is not a pedophile.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Tellingly, researchers have found that victims who experience childhood sexual abuse at the hands of both women and men are more reluctant to disclose the victimization perpetrated by women (Sgroi &amp; Sargent, 1993). Indeed the discomfort of reporting child sexual victimization by a female perpetrator can be so acute that a victim may instead inaccurately report that his or her abuser was male (Longdon, 1993).</p>

    <div class="md"><p><strong>If they aren&#39;t suspicious, then showing them would help debunk this theory</strong></p>

<p>This is a <em>perfect</em> opportunity for Mr. Alefantis to stop all this. Explain what #hotard is</p>

<p>Or #murder #killroom</p>

<p>Jesus its not hard, its like he doesn&#39;t wan&#39;t to address the pictures in any specific manner.</p>

<p>If they really wanted to debunk it they would choose 2 or 3 of the most suspicious ones and include them along with some kind of explanation from mr alefantis, showing that this is all a big misunderstanding. Instead they are making ad hominems against the people raising the issues and saying their evidence doesn&#39;t even merit a response. </p>

<ul>
<li>The pedo symbols on the two business associated with comet, one of which works with &quot;at risk youth&quot;, are a coincidence.   Hearts and pyramids are common symbols.<br/></li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

<p>First of all, notice the substitution here. The &quot;pedo symbols&quot; were not for Comet Ping Pong, nor were they for businesses &quot;associated with Comet&quot;. There were for businesses <em>near</em> Comet. Instead of drawing the obvious conclusion—the logos have nothing to do with Coment—a story was spun that this implied some kind of sinister nexus. Bullshit. These logos have nothing to do with Comet. This is just free-association innuendo.</p>

<p>Only one of the logos is actually that similar to a &quot;pedo symbol&quot;. The <a href="http://i.imgur.com/5iE3V8h.png">Besta Pizza logo</a> has a triangular spiral, which is unusual, and that&#39;s similar to the &quot;BLogo&quot;. On the other hand, it&#39;s yellow, not blue, has pizza toppings, and melting cheese. So it could just be a coincidence.</p>

<p>The other logo <a href="http://i.imgur.com/vkPDkEY.png">is a heart logo</a> with hands and a partial outline. Hearts are <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=heart+logo&amp;amp;tbm=isch&amp;amp;gws_rd=ssl"><em>extremely</em> common symbols</a> and there&#39;s nothing unusual about it.
It has a slight similarity to the <a href="http://i.imgur.com/8PfWSQU.png">&quot;GLogo&quot;</a>, but nothing out of the ordinary.</p>

<p>People have been primed to see similarities whether they exist or not. How many times did people say that the name &quot;James Alefantis&quot; sounds like &quot;J&#39;aimes les enfants&quot;? Well, it really doesn&#39;t. And it happens to be his real name. Internet sleuths traced his ancestry back several generations. (I&#39;m not going to link because of reddit rules.)</p>

<p>People on r/conspiracy are often skeptical of coincidences, but they are actually quite common, especially when you have an army of &quot;weaponized autists&quot; (not my term) let loose with internet search engines to look for them. The &quot;owner&quot; of Besta Pizza is a DOJ lawyer who prosecutes human trafficking! No, the lawyer who registered the corporate papers is another lawyer <a href="http://www.theveritaslawfirm.com/ajk.htm">with the same name</a>. Is that an unlikely coincidence? No, it&#39;s just an artifact of plugging every single name into Google.</p>

<p>Yes fair enough.   Across street and next door to Buck&#39;s I think (also run by Alefantis).   Edited comment.  </p>

<blockquote>

<p>The girl lover logo is small heart within big heart (adult/girl).   Boy lover is small triangle in big triangle (adult/boy).   That logo has small heart in big heart plus small hand on big hand.   So yes it fits.  But yes it could and probably is just a coincidence.  </p>

<p>Well, I did <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/5g3ywi/for_pizzagate_skeptics/dapg66d/">comment on the &quot;Podesta&quot; sketches</a>. The sketches are of <em>one</em> person, not two, and the witnesses described him as a much younger man than either of the Podestas. Since I was at work, I didn&#39;t have time to respond to everything.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not sure that Podesta deleted the emails around when McCann disappeared. Rather, it seems that he barely used Gmail before September, 2007.</p>

<p>Here are the counts of messages in Gmail up through June of 2008. Before September, 2007, there are 18 outgoing messages and only one real reply. On September 18, he and his assistant begin using it in earnest. In November, messages start flooding in. It <em>could</em> be that this is what&#39;s left after deletions, but it doesn&#39;t look like it.</p>

<p>About the Instagram: I don&#39;t know enough about the context of all of these pictures, and I know almost nothing about these people&#39;s lives, so I can&#39;t say what all the parents&#39; reactions will be, but Alefantis has apparently known these children and their parents for years. What the comments mean to them is different from what each of us will perceive. I do know a little about some of the pictures and I can speculate a little.</p>

<p>Because of reddit rules, I can&#39;t link to the pictures, but you can look through them if you know where to find them.</p>

<p>The &quot;baby for sale&quot; was literally a doll for sale in a shop. The comments were &quot;way overpriced&quot; and &quot;creepy&quot;, etc.</p>

<p>The &quot;Why does Daddy like BUTT?&quot; comment looks mysterious on one picture, but when you see the other picture in the set, suddenly it all makes sense. The man is wearing a shirt with a logo for BUTT magazine and the woman is pointing at it.</p>

<p>The hashtag #killroom on one photo seems completely out of the blue ... until you see the picure that it&#39;s apparently referring to. &quot;There&#39;s a creepy space in the back of my shop that&#39;s been designated thusly: picture with &quot;KILL ROOM&quot; and the outline of a coffin written on an unfinished wall. This is from the metal-working artist who was working on a coffin coffee table. These are the kind of allusions that people find hilarious when talking with friends or here on reddit, where if you drop in a reference to &quot;Jolly Rancher&quot; at the appropriate (inappropriate) place, you&#39;ll get lots of comment karma.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t see anything sexual about &quot;Yum…baby&quot;. There&#39;s a well known expression, &quot;you&#39;re so cute, I could eat you up!&quot; There&#39;s nothing sexual about that one, either.</p>

<p>I had assumed that the two commenters were calling each other &quot;#hotard&quot;. It never occurred to me that they were calling the baby &quot;hotard&quot;. That wouldn&#39;t make sense.</p>

<p>And, by the way, I don&#39;t think that they were actually planning to have a sleepover at Comet Ping Pong. I think they&#39;re eating pizza <em>before</em> the sleepover. The caption says &quot;Double sleep over kick off at Comet Ping Pong.&quot; I had wondered why this was on the list of supposedly creepy pictures. It never occurred to me that they were going to sleep there.</p>

<p>The one that I think is probably used in a sexual, but (hopefully) joking way is #chickenlover. But, again, I don&#39;t know these people, so I can&#39;t be sure.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Okay - so I won&#39;t pretend that I&#39;ve spent a lot of time on this.  This is the first post I&#39;ve taken the time to read - so the following criticism is based on the content of THIS post only.</p>

<p>The argument seems to be that their ART and INNUENDO is enough to warrant suspicion of one of the worst forms of crime imaginable.</p>

<p>Let&#39;s just take a moment here.  What is your understanding of justice?  Does your understanding of justice really allow for the accusation of a crime on the basis of artistic representation and innuendo?</p>

<p>Does this not undermine the very foundations of free speech?  What you are doing is applying EXTREMELY HIGH COSTS to their artistic and private expression.   Both of these are meant to be sacrosanct in a free society.  We need art to able to explore the whackiest things - and we need to be able to explore whatever we want in private; to ensure that new ideas have a space to flourish and establish themselves.  If we are all to be judged on the basis of our private speech - with all innuendo and jokes as fair game.  No one would ever feel free to speak against the status quo.  Political opposition would never have the chance to arise.</p>

<p>You might rebut that to make such an accusation is an exercise in free speech.  It certainly is.  But I&#39;m not advocating any sort of policy to stop you.  I&#39;m asking you to really think hard whether YOUR use of this right is just.  And while this criticism of mine does increase the costs of your expression somewhat - it is nothing compared to the costs you are imposing on these people.</p>

<p>Another retort might be that if there is even the smallest possibility of these claims being true - the enormous harm done to innocents justifies any injustice wrought as a consequence of this investigation.  Well - this is why we have institutions which have over hundreds of years developed processes to allow them to pursue such investigations while minimising the risk of injustice through accusation.  If you don&#39;t trust these institutions then your sole activity and singular intent must devote itself toward THE REFORM OF THOSE INSTITUTIONS - you should not take it upon yourself to enforce justice in individual cases.  You should be working toward fixing those institutions.</p>

<p>Please people - get off this forum and put your energies toward fixing the real source of the problems of which this conspiracy - whether it be false or true - is but a symptom.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Those are all fair points.   The biggest problem here is that people no longer trust LEOs to hold elites accountable.   There have simply been too many examples (both in the US and elsewhere) of LEO&#39;s covering up elite pedo rings or engaging in other criminal activities.   The higher up we go the worse it gets (FBI, CIA, Pentagon).   </p>

<p>Also, I&#39;m not sure what Tony Podesta expected people to think when he filled his house with artwork about abusing children.   Same with Amanda Kleinman making music videos about pedophilia and the sexual torture of children.   Surely she <em>wanted</em> such a response unless she was (as people here suspect) just flaunting her pedophilia to her friends?   </p>

<p>As for Alefantis, again, if you&#39;re going to create a &quot;kid friendly&quot; restaurant and hang out with Tony Podesta perhaps it&#39;s not a good idea to make numerous pedophilic remarks on Instagram while posting pictures of children, hold sleepovers at your restaurant with kids, and feature pedophilic artwork for &quot;all ages&quot; rock shows?   </p>

<p>Not really - I don&#39;t have anything to add in response to that beyond what I already wrote.  You are there just restating the accusations and the grounds for those accusations.  Those being the art that they possess and the innuendo surrounding their speech.  I&#39;m saying - it is not just to accuse people on those grounds.  It is NEVER just.  If you want to progress the argument further you need to give me a positive reason to question why my understanding of justice is flawed.</p>

<p>Okay.   Well, I don&#39;t know what to say.   You&#39;re saying it&#39;s horrible to accuse these people of pedophilia while they seem to be deliberately courting such accusations, possibly for the thrill of hiding in plain sight or possibly to cause controversy.   I mean, just watch the Amanda Kleinman music video or look at the spread in Tony Pedosta&#39;s house.   </p>

<p>What&#39;s really bizarre about both Kleinman&#39;s and Abromovich&#39;s responses (if B is true -- that they&#39;re just trying to cause controversy) is that they make no attempt to explain their work; instead they just insist that there is no reason at all for people to be upset and that the whole thing is &quot;fake news&quot; by Trump supporters.   Same with James: no attempt to explain why he likes making sexual comments about kids and toddlers.   You&#39;ll have to admit that the whole thing&#39;s pretty fucking weird.   </p>

<p>Hold up.  I&#39;m asking you a very specific question.   WHAT IS YOUR UNDERSTANDING OF JUSTICE?  In response to this question you keep replying with your and others perceptions of their weirdness - while trying to convince me of this weirdness.</p>

<p>This reply does nothing to further my understanding of your conception of justice.  I want to know why you think it IS just to accuse people of such a crime on the basis of their artistic expression and the innuendo you derive from their speech.</p>

<p>Now - I gave you a very specific account of why I think your behaviour IS unjust.  I&#39;ll repeat it.  The reason is that if we allow such accusations - on the basis of their artistic expression and innuendo derived from their speech; then we undermine the very foundations of our society.  We need the costs on artistic expression and individual speech to be low - otherwise there will be no spheres in which opposition to the status quo can take root and grow.  Political reform will become impossible.</p>

<p>Now if you disagree with this claim - then you need to state why - and you need to assert an alternative conception of justice to use.</p>

<p>Re-stating how weird you think their behaviour is - IS NOT AN ANSWER to what I&#39;m asking for.  I&#39;m willing (for sake of argument only) agree that they are a bunch of fucking weirdoes.  I still don&#39;t believe that they deserve to be accused of a horrific crime on that basis - and I don&#39;t believe this because of my understanding of what justice is.</p>

<p>If you aren&#39;t able to provide an alternative conception of justice to use... then you should accept mine - or at least accept that this discussion can&#39;t progress any further until you do.</p>

<p>Are you saying that people should not be allowed free speech?   Because that sounds like what you&#39;re saying.   So if I make a music video featuring images of kids intercut with images of people bleeding out the rectum and being penetrated with foreign objects etc.   People should not be allowed to say, &quot;what the fuck are you doing?&quot;   What is the relevance of this sadistic pedophilic imagery?

    <div class="md"><blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Definitely not - and I did address this in my very first post in this thread.  But this is a very important question - it&#39;s understandable that you would ask it - and so I&#39;m happy to take the time to expand my answer.  Sorry - this post is long.  I believe it&#39;s worth your time.  This issue is so important - and I&#39;ve personally put a lot of work into understanding it.</p>

<p>So - I&#39;ll make a number of core claims about free speech as I progress.  The first is the following.</p>

<p><strong>1) We should keep the costs on speech as low as possible in all cases.</strong></p>

<p>This is really just a re-statement of the principle of free speech itself.  The idea is that we should punish people as little as possible for expressing themselves.  I think you and I would both agree 100% with this principle.  The question will be - who is violating the spirit of 1) more - you or me?</p>

<p>The next claim is:</p>

<p><strong>2) The receipt of general criticism (e.g. challenging its truth, it&#39;s appropriateness... etc) for an act of public expression is an acceptable cost to bear - and is not a violation of the spirit of 1).</strong></p>

<p>I think it likely that we both strongly agree with this claim.  Criticism can sting one&#39;s pride - but it can&#39;t fundamentally hurt you.  Furthermore - to assert that criticism does violate 1) would lead us to self-contradiction since it would mean that a very large swathe of speech and discourse would be ruled out.  This itself would be a violation of the spirit of 1) since 1) wants to allow for as much speech as possible.</p>

<p>Private speech is another matter.  It&#39;s a much more subtle issue about how much one should have to receive criticism for private speech.  But since the people pizza-gate is talking about have done a lot of this stuff publicly - we can just stick to thinking about public speech for now.  </p>

<p>Next we come to a question.  Is what you and pizza-gate doing mere criticism as mentioned in 2)?  You seem to present it as such when you wrote:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>So if I make a music video featuring images of kids intercut with images of people bleeding out the rectum and being penetrated with foreign objects etc. People should not be allowed to say, &quot;what the fuck are you doing?&quot; What is the relevance of this sadistic pedophilic imagery? What are you trying to say here? Because that&#39;s basically what people are doing.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If this was all you were doing - I would have no problem with it.  But my understanding was - and correct me if I&#39;m wrong - that the core aim of pizza-gate was to investigate an accusation of actual child sexual abuse.  An ACTUAL accusation.  I submit that this is not mere criticism... why? </p>

<p>To answer this I&#39;ll need the third core claim about free speech:</p>

<p><strong>3) The receipt of an accusation of criminal behaviour for an act of public expression (which itself isn&#39;t a direct confession to anything) is a very high cost to bear and therefore a violation of the spirit of 1).</strong></p>

<p>An accusation of criminality is a high cost to bear because people&#39;s lives can be destroyed as a result.  Unlike mere criticism - it really can hurt you.  People can lose their jobs - friends and family can feel pressured to ostracise them... etc.  That&#39;s real damage.  As such - making an accusation like child sexual abuse on the basis of public expression alone - is a clear violation of 1).  You are imposing a very high cost on a group of people with nothing but acts of expression as the justification.  To be justified in making accusations of criminality - you need REAL evidence - not just innuendo.</p>

<p>For this reason I argue that you are violating the core principle of free speech as stated in 1).  You are imposing unacceptably high costs of expression on others - without sufficient justification.  I don&#39;t think you intend this violation of 1) - I think your intentions are good.  I just don&#39;t think you&#39;ve thought it all through as much as you should.  And that&#39;s why I&#39;m here - to help you do this.  I don&#39;t mean to talk down to you.  I&#39;m genuinely here to try and help you think more clearly about these issues.</p>

<p>Now let&#39;s turn to my own behaviour.  By criticizing you - am I imposing an unacceptable cost upon you such that it would be a violation of 1)?  I say no.  Why?  Because I&#39;m only engaging in mere criticism.  I don&#39;t think what you are doing is a crime.  I do not think you deserve to be punished by any institution.  There is a fourth claim we could include here:</p>

<p><strong>4) Only institutional violations of 1) should receive institutional punishment.</strong></p>

<p>That is to say - that if Governments, corporations, etc... impose very high costs on acts of speech - then our other institutions  and the citizenry are free to impose very high costs on them in return.  We allow this because of the disproportionate amount of power that they wield - and that power must be kept in check.</p>

<p>The people like yourself who are involved in pizza-gate are not part of a powerful institution (I hope).  Thus I don&#39;t believe you deserve to be punished for it.  All I can do in response is engage in sincere criticism in the hope I can convince you to change.  But if you choose not to - there is nothing further I can do about it.  That is simultaneously the most sacred and the most terrifying aspect of our society.  It is a genuinely terrifying in that we as individuals have the power to transgress the spirit of 1) - and destroy our society as result (if enough of us do it).  That&#39;s why it&#39;s so important that those of us who understand these issues well take the time out to try to explain them in good faith - and the belief that you are more than capable of understanding.  I have faith that you will.</p>

<p>So no - I do not feel I am violating the spirit of 1).  I&#39;m not accusing you of any crime.  I think you are behaving unwisely - but not criminally.  I don&#39;t think anyone should fire you - or end their friendships with you.  I am merely criticising you.</p>

<p>Anyway - I really hope you take some time to really think through all of this.  If you want to go deeper - I can recommend some resources to help you develop a stronger understanding.</p>

I guess I&#39;ll just ask what you think the best course of action is beyond calling the FBI, which is obviously a non-starter since the assumption (a valid one in my view) is that the role of the FBI is to protect elite criminals, not arrest them.   You apparently think there isn&#39;t enough evidence here to justify researching these people, but a lot of people apparently do.   They believe horrible crimes are being perpetrated as we speak.

    <div class="md"><p>Cool - so first up... know that I share your concerns about the current state of institutions meant to deal with these things - (although I personally haven&#39;t done the research and work required to advocate publicly about it - so I&#39;m not willing to make a formal accusation against them either).</p>

<p>Second - I don&#39;t think I said you can&#39;t investigate your claims (if I did - I didn&#39;t mean it as such).  What I said is that you shouldn&#39;t make a public accusation without evidence.</p>

<p>Research and investigations though do not have to be public.  So you can, or small groups of you can, PRIVATELY investigate your suspicions.  If it&#39;s private - and you do it VERY CAREFULLY - then this gives you an opportunity to search for genuine evidence without hurting the people you are investigating in the meantime.</p>

<p>If you choose to do this - just make sure that you know what is required for you to do this legally in your country.  Don&#39;t even think about breaking the law to achieve your aims - launching a genuine private investigation is such a huge undertaking you are currently a long way from ever facing a situation where a legal restriction is blocking your investigation anyway.  So - know the rules and play by them.</p>

<p>Really - I would not advocate any of you to actually do this unless you have - or are willing to get training as a private investigator or an investigative reporter.  Without that training the risk of fucking it up is just too high - you could get yourself hurt, you could be careless and expose the people you are investigating without enough evidence.  And if you get made - you could send all the perps underground (burning photos and wiping drives) as they almost certainly have done in this case already if there was any truth to it.</p>

<p>What you could do instead - again, privately - is hire a professional.  You could crowdsource funds by say - using a private subreddit and bitcoin donations...</p>

<p>I&#39;m not entirely sure overall it&#39;s going to be a good thing for society if people are launching private investigations into the fellow citizens on the basis of internet conspiracies.  But you guys are obviously determined - so I&#39;m trying to give you something.  </p>

<p>Consider this suggestion as middle ground.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The only problem with your argument is that someone could investigate the individuals and instances which are suspected of being criminal, and never ever make a criminal accusation against them.</p>

<p>In which case you are arguing that no group curiosity or investigation ought to occur, since the result is separate instances of investigators violating the spirit of free speech. Which means you are censoring the investigation as a whole.</p>

<p>Here is a claim I will make: I am responsible enough to hold the lives or deaths of every human being on earth in my hands.</p>

<p>That is essentially what every presidential candidate claims when they run for president. Maybe they don&#39;t make that claim to you, but for most Americans, that is what the president is capable of (based on their understanding.)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My apologies but I&#39;m having a little trouble in understanding your precise meaning.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>...someone could investigate the individuals and instances which are suspected of being criminal, and never ever make a criminal accusation against them...</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I don&#39;t quite see how it follows that no group investigation ought to occur if no accusations are made.  Group activity can be considered private - so long as the group is small enough and no one outside learns of its activities.</p>

<p>Perhaps you mean to claim that it follows from my position that no PUBLIC investigation can occur if no public accusation is made.  Then yes - this is a logical outcome of my view.  I&#39;m not sure why you feel this outcome is a poor one.</p>

<p>For what reason did a private investigation fail to make a public accusation?  Is it because after their investigation they failed to uncover any genuine evidence?  Then - the fact that they don&#39;t make a public accusation is as it should be.  For if they did - they would be imposing HIGH COSTS on the mere expression of those under suspicion and thus violating their right to freedom of speech.</p>

<p>But if they did find strong evidence as a result of their private investigation then my view is that you are allowed to make a public accusation (and you should).  While you do indeed still harm those you are accusing, you are now reasonably imposing that harm on the basis of the DEEDS of those under suspicion - as opposed to their MERE speech.</p>

<p>Also - I&#39;m not saying you have to have such evidence that you have to entirely prove the matter beyond reasonable doubt.  That can be for the public investigation and trial to obtain.  But you do have to have MORE than mere speech and innuendo to get the public investigation started.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Which means you are censoring the investigation as a whole.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No - I&#39;m definitely not.  Let&#39;s just get clear on what censorship is first - to make sure we agree on a definition.</p>

<p><strong>Censorship is an act that makes use of some form of force in order to restrict public expression.</strong></p>

<p>The possible types of force involved can vary.  It could involve physical removal of public expression.  Or it could involve some kind of social harm that harms the status of the person expressing themselves.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not doing either of these things.  I&#39;m merely criticizing those that choose to make public accusations without sufficient evidence to do so.  As I wrote above - mere criticism does not cause harm and is not an imposition on free speech.  I don&#39;t want you to feel shame.  I don&#39;t want you to think you&#39;re a bad person.  All I want you to acknowledge is that you got this one wrong.  No big deal - we all get confused and make mistakes.  I&#39;m trying to keep the cost of your expression as low as I can.</p>

<p>I do indeed want the people involved in pizza-gate to cease making the accusations they are making - but I am not using any kind of force to achieve this outcome.  Indeed - I believe it would be a worse result for all of us were I to resort to force.  Instead - I&#39;m using criticism in an attempt influence you.  I wish you to cease your accusations - <strong>but only if you find my arguments reasonable and compelling</strong>.  I can&#39;t force you into this.  I can only rely on your innate sense of justice, goodwill and willingness to ensure you&#39;ve done everything you can to challenge your own beliefs.</p>

<p>Thus there is NO sense in which I am censoring you.</p>

<p>Here is a claim I will make: I am responsible enough to hold the lives or deaths of every human being on earth in my hands.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I must confess I don&#39;t understand what you are trying to get across with this claim - I can&#39;t tell if you are intending some point of irony.  Can you please elaborate your intention here?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>What you are proposing is even more that censoring free speech (in the form of online discussions) what you are proposing is censoring curiosity...</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Again - not censoring - for the reasons I gave above.  Having said that I think we can rephrase your claim here to make it a little more compelling - by avoiding the reference to censorship.  I think the result might better express what you are trying to get at.  Let&#39;s try:</p>

<p>a) By reason alone everyone should realise they should not publicly make serious accusations without evidence that goes beyond the mere speech of those under suspicion.
b) If a) is true then it follows that we should never discuss our concerns about the speech of others ever - even when they say really concerning things.
c) But this outcome would amount to a significant curtailment of speech generally and intuitively violates the spirit of the principle of free speech (which seeks to maximise speech).
d) But if we have violated the principle of free speech as a result - it could never have been reasonable to believe that everyone must refrain from expressing their concerns about the speech of others.  Thus  premise a) - must be false.</p>

<p>This is a reductio-ad-absurdum and is the best presentation of your argument that I can manage.  I hope you feel it does you justice and matches your intent.</p>

<p>Stated as such - I think the argument is not without merit - and it actually warns us against a specific form of complacency that I completely agree we should guard against.  But it does fail to keep the distinction between public and private discourse separate which is absolutely crucial.  To fix it we need to change b) to:</p>

<p>b) If a) is true then it follows that we should never PUBLICLY discuss our concerns about the speech of others ever - even when they say really concerning things.</p>

<p>With this change - I claim that c) no longer follows.  The curtailment of speech is no longer significant - it only curtails speech to the point where such speech itself would be an imposition on the free speech of others.  It&#39;ll be easiest to understand this if we work through an example.</p>

<p>Consider the example of a person who for the most part seems to understand social convention - maybe he occasionally acts strange - but nothing certifiable.  He has a job and family and people depend on him.  Now suppose that in the middle of an otherwise joking conversation with a group of people - he suddenly assumes a calm, serious expression and begins to explain - in graphic detail - the pleasures of raping young children.  At the end of this tale he suddenly looks mirthful again and asks if everyone understood his joke - and tries to get everyone to laugh about it.</p>

<p>Now this is merely an act of speech.  But does it follow that those who witnessed his story shouldn&#39;t feel curious or concerned about what they heard?  No - of course not.  They should absolutely be concerned.  I think we both agree that this is just common sense.</p>

<p>Does my view entail that they should NEVER express this concern or explore it?  No it doesn&#39;t.  My view is that they are allowed to express this concern privately - but not publicly.  Everyone in that group was privy to the original discussion.  Thus if they talk about it amongst themselves - then they are still only doing so privately - and thus are not violating his free speech.  They are not causing him any harm he hasn&#39;t already caused himself.</p>

<p>But if - say - one person in the group expressed his concern to the man&#39;s boss - encouraging the boss to fire him?  The boss wasn&#39;t present to hear it himself so this action is tantamount to a public accusation and would be a violation of what I advocate.  It is imposing significant costs on the guy for what is still ultimately nothing but a joke - an extremely BAD joke - and certainly a worrying sign.  But still - officially - a joke.</p>

<p>If you want to ensure no harm is coming to children - what can you do?  You can take your concerns to the police and ask them to investigate it.  That&#39;s what those institutions are for.  It&#39;s possible the police won&#39;t be discreet in their investigation.  But that&#39;s not your responsibility.  If they end up publicly accusing him without sufficient evidence - that&#39;s on them, not you.</p>

<p>Finally - to bring it closer to the pizza-gate case - suppose the police refuse to investigate - but you remain concerned nonetheless.  At this point I advocate hiring a professional private investigator - but doing so without publicly disclosing what you are doing.</p>

<p>So - overall - as I see it... nothing I have said shuts down curiosity entirely.  It just sets up what I think are ultimately very commonsense limits to how you express that curiosity.  They still give you plenty of options to ensure that your curiosity and concern are explored in a way that is fair to both parties.</p>

<p>The core of my argument is that if you don&#39;t respect those limits - then you end up yourself violating the free speech of others and causing immeasurable harm.  This is an outcome that I know you don&#39;t actually wish.</p>

<hr/>

<p>Final point...</p>

<p>These points are really subtle - and take a lot of work to understand.  And that&#39;s part of the reason why I have infinite patience for this discussion and I don&#39;t feel ANYONE should feel ashamed for getting this wrong.   It&#39;s not your fault... it&#39;s our shitty schools and overall apathy that didn&#39;t teach most of us to carefully and painstakingly work through these concepts.</p>

<p>As long as you are working hard to understand this as best you can - you are doing as much as anyone could ask.  Since you engaged in critical discussion with me - which takes time and effort to be sure - I count you as one such person.</p>

<p>Yeah, this is what bothers me more than anything. I feel like the people here are sheltered suburban autists and anything representing gay culture or counter culture has some hidden darker meaning to them. And what&#39;s worse, they go on to accuse these people of something where just the accusation destroys lives. It&#39;s like none of these people have ever gone to a dive bar or been to a punk show or whatever. It&#39;s like they have never been to the &quot;gay&quot; side of whatever town they live in. They are sheltered and they are getting this out of context snapshot of people talking to people they know with in-jokes and &quot;coded&quot; language between friends and close colleagues, and they instantly assume it must be PEDOPHILIA?! Hell, this made me think of the e-mails and conversations between me an my own mother from back before she passed. We probably sounded nuts, but we had 30 years of history we could use as context when talking to each other and we liked to be creative and silly. </p>

<p>This whole thing is honestly pretty scary and it is a close look at how the satanic panic in the 90s happened. We look back and think how in the fuck did they allow that, but here we go again. </p>

Hidden rooms ,handle less doors , hidden secret rooms... bathrooms hidden behind panel  I would never and have never known such of a place so blatant. So , if I were them , and I WASN&#39;T a pedophilic Satan worshiper ,I would find another way to express my artistic appreciation...something more appropriate.You see this type of weirdo shit  doesn&#39;t sit well with normal people ... it just doesn&#39;t. Fuck Ping Pong.. Fuck the Pedo&#39;s . God only knows what&#39;s going on , and we will find out ... something , because I think that Wiki didn&#39;t dump everything . Some things they could not or would not dump en masse .. Downloading child pornography is a serious crime..so I&#39;m positive we don&#39;t and won&#39;t have everything. ... </p>

<p>I actually share much of their distrust of the current institutions tasked with investigating these sorts of things.  But as I said - this does not give us the right to pursue justice in individual cases ourselves.  This goes against the very core of the concept of a free and just society.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Part of the problem with MSM is that it is beholden to the advertisers. No business, no matter how evil or corrupt, wants their commercial to air right before or right after a pedo story. Maalox, maybe. But that&#39;s it. 
Fact is, though, this is way too horrifying to not investigate. Someone, or some organization, needs to step up and take the lead. In the open. With the explicit intention of uncovering the whole truth, not just bits and pieces. The more investigators there are, the better. They can&#39;t kill everyone...
But, expect the war drums to beat louder and louder the closer and closer we get to the truth. Someone mentioned &quot;bio-bomb&quot; below, as if the elites would set one off the more the light grows. I agree. They will, through false flags and fabricated enemies. 
It&#39;s difficult to sift through the disinfo garbage, the red herrings, the outright lies, to disseminate the truth. Keep striving, all. Keep striving.</p>

If you actually open the article at <a href="http://washingtonlife.com/2015/06/05/inside-homes-private-viewing/">the bottom of this page</a>, the Djurdjevic paintings hanging in Podesta&#39;s home are <a href="http://i.imgur.com/DZ5XWux.png"><em>Synchronized Swimming</em></a> and <a href="http://i.imgur.com/0vekdCZ.png"><em>Garden</em></a>.</p>

<p>Incidentally, there&#39;s a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNaUvMxcIiw">video of Djurdjevic talking</a> at the exhibit that includes <em>Garden</em>. It&#39;s not all that enlightening, though.</p>

<p>People also implied that <a href="https://remedianetwork.net/2014/06/23/the-arch-of-hysteria/">Louise Bourgeois’ <em>The Arch of Hysteria</em></a> has something to do with Jeffrey Dahmer. It doesn&#39;t.</p>

<p>Podesta and his wife amassed a vast collection of about 2,000 museum-quality artworks before they split. <a href="http://imgur.com/a/mbNkA">Here&#39;s an imgur album of some works from their collection</a>, including works in his house and ones that they have donated to the <a href="https://nmwa.org/">National Museum of Women in the Arts</a>. As you can see, there are a wide variety of styles and themes.</p>

<p>The same caution applies to what&#39;s said about Marina Abramovic. People have been trying to pass off pictures from <a href="http://www.socialitelife.com/photos/lady-gaga-attends-the-watermill-center-summer-benefit/lady-gaga-watermill-benefit-07292013-11">this benefit</a>, which Abramovic <em>attended</em>, as if it&#39;s <em>Spirit Cooking</em>.</p>

<p>Abramovic has used the term <em>Spirit Cooking</em> to refer to several things:</p>

<p><a href="http://imgur.com/a/mqcK1">Spirit Cooking — the etchings and book.</a> (from <a href="http://www.editionjs.com/img/abramovic/">http://www.editionjs.com/img/abramovic/</a>  or <a href="https://www.moma.org/collection/works/portfolios/143945?locale=en">MoMA</a>)</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EsJLNGVJ7E">Spirit Cooking — the exhibit and performance art.</a></p>

<p><a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/maihudson/marina-abramovic-institute-the-founders">Spirit Cooking — the fundraising dinner.</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>[LIVE EVENT / THE EXERCISES: SPIRIT COOKING WITH MARINA ABRAMOVIC] A dinner night with Marina during which she will teach you and other backers at this level how to cook a series of traditional soups, which you will all enjoy together. The night will end with the making of a golden ball, a recipe given to Marina in a Tibetan monastery. Marina will bring to this dinner a Spirit Cooking memento for each backer to keep. PLUS MAI and OMA office tour, Neuroscience Exclusives, OMA / MAI Digital Design Package, Complete Abramovic Method Exclusives, access to ALL $25 live stream exercises / live events, MAI 101 Lecture and Digital Booklet, MAI Founder (CHAMBER FOUNDER), Digital MAI rewards, and The Embrace rewards.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I can&#39;t pretend to have seen but a small fraction of Abramovic&#39;s work. There&#39;s nudity and sexual themes in some of it, but is there really &quot;satanism, pedophilia and cannibalism&quot;?</p>

<p>I&#39;ve been meaning to watch some videos to learn more about her. Hopefully I&#39;ll have some time this weekend. I made a list of these, but I haven&#39;t watched any of them all the way through.</p>

<p>The totality of the evidence is that an investigation is warranted by authorities. </p>

<p>The only way to make this happen is to report these people to the authorities, en masse. Then, they can tank the investigation. But, at this stage, people aren&#39;t acting to get even that far.</p>

<p>According to a well researched article by Media Matters, of all places, Giustra&#39;s ties to gold mining in Kazakhstan go way back.</p>

<p>2008.01.31  After Mining Deal, Financier Donated to Clinton <a href="https://archive.is/cvAH0">https://archive.is/cvAH0</a></p>

<p>2008.01.31  NY Times failed to note Giustra reportedly involved in Kazakhstan mining deals more than a decade ago <a href="https://archive.is/0Z3ef">https://archive.is/0Z3ef</a></p>

<p><strong>I think the smoking gun for Pizzagate will be found when Frank Giustra get&#39;s tied to human trafficking.</strong> I have reason to believe the Kazakh mining interests owned by Giustra rely on forced labor from trafficked Mongolians. Considering how involved Giustra is in mining, all over the world, and the fact there is a &quot;nexus of gold mining and human trafficking,&quot; it seems clear that he is brushing up against trafficking regularly in order to make money. Forced labor is just another cog in the wheel.</p>

I assume there are people in the FBI who genuinely do want to put a stop to it all (assuming for the purposes of this convo that pizzagate is real). These guys investigate pedophilia, and when their investigation takes them to a &quot;dangerous place&quot; like finding out your superiors are operating a giant pedo ring, you get shut down.

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah but WikiLeaks revealed the Pedo symbols, contrary to what I said earlier about the FBI revealing them. Those symbols are how they communicate. They couldn&#39;t realistically just send out mass emails to inform people of the new symbols or means of communication. And the fact that WikiLeaks were the ones who revealed the info would seem to suggest that the FBI won&#39;t or can&#39;t do anything about it, a fact that the elite would be very aware of. Take the law enforcement agencies out of the equation and the only real way anyone is ever gonna get caught is if someone on the inside was gonna circumvent all usual and legal channels and release the info to the public. Which, evidently, happened.</p>

<p>Of course not, they would handle their business like sensible people: </p>

<ul>
<li>They would not advertise pedo services for any joe off the street</li>
<li>They would not gather <em>any</em> business from the elite if they advertised themselves in public as pedo-pals.</li>
<li>They would attract clientele only from trusted <em>private</em> sources, not from signage on their storefront.</li>
<li>Only an imbecile would advertise their child trafficking business on their stationary.</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
<p>Those symbols are how they communicate.</p>

<p>Is there any proof that those symbols are still in use? Any busts in since those symbols came to light? Any intel on what pedophiles think of their symbols being exposed? Do you think the intel would show that they don&#39;t care and would continue to use those symbols recklessly, because, hey, I&#39;ve already got the letterhead printed up.</p>

<p>Do you think pedophiles, especially ones who operate massive operations that involve huge sums of money and powerful people are going to behave like buffoons and advertise their pedophilia in public for everyone to see? Powerful elite pedophiles would crush them fucks like whoa, for even sending out a whiff of endangering their nasty hobby.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>To your first point, these people are not just being implicated in pedophilia, they&#39;re being implicated in operating massive world wide pedophilia rings. They get <em>all</em> the clientele. </p>

<p>To your second point I say &quot;why?&quot; When they started advertising the symbols, the symbols <em>were</em> to talk to the elite. Specifically. The elite didn&#39;t adopt the symbolism from yoir average online predator, the symbolism would have started at the top. A politician brings his lawyer friend into the mix, the lawyer does dealings with pedophiliac local business owners, who begin to turn a profit by dealing with lower end clientele. Just like a drug ring. Code words and symbols.</p>

<p>To your third point, I would agree. The elites traveling the world and snatching children would not be advertising pedo symbols because they would (EDIT: Should say &quot;would not&quot;) be looking to personally do business with your average joe pedo. But a place like Comet Ping Pong, who isn&#39;t selling children to the elites but to local pedophiles, might. A guy like Jimmy Comet might.</p>

<p>To your last point I say: Only an imbecile would store classified information on an unsecure network when their job title is <strong>Secretary of State</strong>.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Those seem to be friends interacting playfully. Do you have any friends with kids? Do you have family? Sharing of photos of kids is what people with kids do. You cant seriously think &#39;baby for sale&#39; indicates a genuine offer is being made.</p>

<p>From that curated selection of photos you can tell there is a group of people familiar with each other interacting with each in an often playful manner, as people frequently do. You can tell that there is also playful interaction between adults involving sexuality. </p>

<p>There is no indication of is pedophilia or abuse. The stretching involved in trying to twist their posts into something nefarious is ridiculous. Did you notice the number of photos from that link that seem to have nothing to with anything other than show that they are weird or artsy? Thats how far the stretching went: there is such a lack of evidence that they have to try to paint the targets as perverted weirdos, like the whole img link was put together by squeaky clean repressed puritans who are putting on the pretense of being appalled.</p>

<p>What is obvious from that link is that people are trying hard to force the narrative, trying to mold everything into the predetermined conclusion that the targets are monstrous pedophiles. The big problem is that there is not evidence to back up that conclusion.</p>

<p>Yes and I have never seen anything like this. In fact I&#39;ve trawled around <em>looking</em> for suspicious instagrams like Jamess and so far, have come across nothing anywhere near as suspect. </p>

<p>Yeah, so why doesn&#39;t James specifically explain what #hotard actually means and why it was a label applied to an infant?</p>

<p>Why doesn&#39;t he tell us where that digging was and the purpose?</p>

<p>This isn&#39;t hard, and I&#39;m not saying we have the right to know this, but if I were in his shoes and innocent that&#39;s exactly what I&#39;d be doing, not calling everyone bringing up the issues homophobic and racist</p>

<p>I assumed it was for the people he was interacting with, as some playfully derogative ribbing between friends. I&#39;ve  not heard the term before, but that sounds like it could be a reasonable usage. What could it possibly mean when applied to an infant? Did he call the baby a retarded ho? That doesn&#39;t seem likely. Those people are his friends or co-workers or family, he would not seriously call their kid a retard right in front of them.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>but if I were in his shoes and innocent that&#39;s </p>
</blockquote>

<p>He has no responsibility to prove his innocence, his innocence is still intact, no one has proved him guilty of anything. I&#39;m sure he&#39;s quite  blustered by all the masses of trolls harassing him, his business, his friends, his family. Madness! For someone who has not been shown to have been guilty of any wrongdoing, he sure has been slandered and harassed pretty heavily.</p>

<p>Well yeah if he didn&#39;t have another with #killroom and #murder and an image of a toy baby for sale, and an image of an infant with money in its mouth, and another image with presumably the same money next to a bottle of xanax labeled &quot;Fun times in europe&quot; then I wouldn&#39;t assume #hotard means retarded ho.

    <div class="md"><p>That toy baby is creepy as hell. I would <em>love</em> to have a copy of that. Probably quite expensive.</p>

<blockquote>
<h1>killroom and #murder</h1>
</blockquote>

<p>What is that a photo of? A walk-in freezer? The most reasonable explanation for that labels is that they are joking. They are not publicly advertising the space where they kill people. That makes no sense. So we are to assume that they showed off their murder chamber to all of their friends and any random person who stumbled on their Instagram: really though, for real, truly, for real, really?</p>

<p>Apparently killroom is also a pop culture thing, related to Dexter tv show? Hmm.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>and an image of an infant with money in its mouth</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The photo of the baby with those stacks of euros in its mouth? Babies put everything in their mouths. Dunno what&#39;s up with the other photo with money and that pair of pill bottles.</p>

<p>Again, it appears to be all just people looking for pedophilia where none exists, and trying to frame everything to fit that narrative. They&#39;ve posted some tacky sexual stuff, but nothing indicates anything relating to pedophilia. There really just isn&#39;t any solid evidence to indicate they are doing anything other than posting innocent shit on the internet.</p>

<p>Almost everything, or maybe even everything, about Pizzagate seems to fall apart when you actually look at it. Yet people soldier on, repeating debunked claims, posting the same photos and memes and exposes over and over that contain no actual proof of anything other than <em>weirdness</em>.</p>

<p>It&#39;s all a dark joke seems to be a recurring defense for pedophillia. Maybe pedophiles just have a inconceivably dark sense of humor? Because no one I know thinks its funny to call infants retarded ho&#39;s. Do you?</p>

<p>Ok so why didn&#39;t the NYT just show the damn photos? I know I wouldn&#39;t be here if they had...</p>

All my adult life I have researched conspiracy topics, I&#39;ve never seen any group stretch things so far as pizzagaters (ok, maybe nibiru people). One second everyone is in on it, then another no one is, and they need hobo marks to find businesses that will help them be depraved.

    <div class="md"><p>Good point. To communicate in such a blatantly reckless and idiotic manner would mean there&#39;d be some real dumb fucks behind the operation. If these people are supposedly in cahoots with the upperest of the upper crust, then they would not communicate in such a manner. There&#39;s a lot at stake in that kind of business, to flaunt it so would be downright dumb.</p>

<p>People who were into that thing, powerful people, would not choose them as they pedo patrons, as they would be considered a risky choice, a place that proudly emblazons hints and clues to their operation. No way a pedo ring connected to the most powerful people in DC is run in a slipshod manner. That makes zero sense.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So you get to disregard all of this simply because in the 80&#39;s there was a blip in which Christians feared satanism in rock music? Must be nice.</p>

<p>And the evidence hasn&#39;t been found yet, this is the <em>investigation</em> part and said investigation is turning up a LOT of, at the <em>very least</em>, nasty language / imagery strange coded words for a family pizza place and those associated with HRC&#39;s team.</p>

<p>At the very least, you should be able to say &quot;man some of those people are pretty weird and they use a coded language and some of this isn&#39;t appropriate for a family business and it is a little strange that they associate with important politicians&quot; - which is not evidence of anything but should at least be considered and not entirely disregarded and perhaps give you a clue that maybe things aren&#39;t what they seem to be.</p>

<p>Maybe it&#39;s escorts.</p>

<p>Maybe it&#39;s drugs.</p>

<p>Maybe it&#39;s bribes.</p>

<p>Maybe it&#39;s something else entirely.</p>

<p>But they&#39;ve been branded as pedophiles from the beginning, numerous people associated with them have been branded, and anyone who extols the virtue of not yelling pedophile in a crowded internet when there is nothing concrete to back it up is also instantly branded.</p>

<p>These are life-ruining accusations, and here they being made without any proof to back them up. The case is built on coincidence, pareidolia, <em>&quot;&#39;think of the children&#39; satanic panic&quot;</em>, enabled by the momentum of an uncritical herd.</p>

<p>Pizzagate will be remembered as a callous witchhunt that only ended up fucking up others peoples lives, without enough evidence to even warrant a police complaint, without enough evidence to offer <em>any</em> conclusive proof of guilt.</p>

<p>It&#39;s some fucked-up shit. It&#39;s sad that there&#39;ll be a dozen replies to this calling me a pedo for trying to exercise critical thinking skills. The hivemind herdmob must be kowtowed to, or else you&#39;ll be branded a pedo-pal. Better to be a bully than the the one being bullied.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So that&#39;s your response? Innocent people might get hurt? - while the entire basis for the investigations are that innocent children may be being hurt in a systematic  ritualistic way and regardless of validity, something very eerie and extremely unprofessional is going on at a nightclub involving many of DC&#39;s elite - and yet you can&#39;t even acknowledge that due to your concerns.</p>

<p>In fact, you&#39;re now bringing up an entirely different concern. Not of evidence, but of appearance. </p>

<p>I suppose this doesn&#39;t have enough &quot;weirdness&quot; going on to convince you that anything out of the ordinary is going on because you are too concerned that someone might get labeled something they&#39;re not.</p>

<p>Of course, if everyone&#39;s wrong then the truth will win over, right? So what&#39;s the concern again? We will look callous and foolish. And you&#39;re concerned you&#39;ll be labeled a pedo for not buying in? Concern, concern, concern. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t buy that these are your original thoughts - that&#39;s more of a stretch than OP&#39;s conclusions.</p>

<p>But if it&#39;s evidence you&#39;ll want, be patient. It&#39;s certainly coming and it won&#39;t be in the form of coded words.</p>

<p>The truth has leaked out many times before, the timing of it this time around is all that matters here.</p>

<p>&quot;Think of the children!&quot;</p>

<p>Not exactly a proud banner there.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;weirdness&quot; going on to convince you that anything out of the ordinary</p>

<p>The targets have been deemed pedophiles over <em>weirdness</em>? Surely a sensible move.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Of course, if everyone&#39;s wrong then the truth will win over, right? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>That&#39;s not how baseless pedophile witchhunts work. They targets of those witchhunts have their lives ruined, regardless of how glaringly innocent they are. You do not go around slathering people as pedophiles without evidence. The accusatations being throw around are irresponsible and reckless, exerting that nasty mob mentality and immunity to reason that accompanies witchhunts of this sort.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>But if it&#39;s evidence you&#39;ll want, be patient. It&#39;s certainly coming and it won&#39;t be in the form of coded words.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Oh, that&#39;s good to know. The reddit herdmob has already tried and convicted several people as pedophiles, <em>without evidence of any wrongdoing</em>, but it&#39;s okay because at some unspecified future date the &#39;truth&#39; will come out. Surely another adept investigatory move.</p>

<p>Announce you&#39;re investigating the most powerful people in the world for running a satanic child-trafficking ring, then bumble about the investigation disregarding facts and reason simply because they obstruct the narrative, they blemish the predetermined guilt of the targets. If there ever was any damning evidence it&#39;d be gone by now.</p>

<p>The evidence spurring on this faithfully inept investigation? <em>Weirdness</em>, bullshit codewords 4chan pulled from theiranus, and puritanical conjecture based on an almost total lack of anything resembling evidence, and an absolute total lack of proof that anyone has done anything wrong, a total lack of evidence that anyone has been harmed at all.</p>

<p>But we should think of the children! Think of all of the children that have not been shown to be in any danger from Alefantis et al. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>I don&#39;t buy that these are your original thoughts - that&#39;s more of a stretch than OP&#39;s conclusions.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know what that means, but I feel slighted. I do sometimes have original thoughts. It&#39;s not totally unheard of, it has been recorded multiple times, probably.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The sketches (&quot;e-fits&quot;) were created in 2008 by a team of investigators from Oakley International that were hired by the McCanns’ Find Madeleine fund. They were released to the public in 2013.[1]</p>

<p>They are based on the sighting of a man (not two men) carrying a child near the hotel where Maddie McCann disappeared, at around 10pm. Several members of the Smith family gave statements to the police a few weeks after the disappearance.](<a href="http://www.mccannpjfiles.co.uk/PJ/MARTIN_SMITH.htm">http://www.mccannpjfiles.co.uk/PJ/MARTIN_SMITH.htm</a> They described the man as &quot;about 35/40 years old&quot;, &quot;about 35 years, or older&quot;, and &quot;between 20/30 years of age&quot; (the last one was from a 12 year old girl, so should be considered less reliable).[2]</p>

<p>The Podesta brothers—besides being two people, not one—were 59 and 63 years old in 2007.</p>

<p>Four months later, &quot;Martin Smith contacted our department stating that after having observed the McCann family on TV alighting from the plane, he believes that the person he saw carrying the child that night was Gerry McCann.&quot;[2]</p>

<p>But he later changed his mind and &quot;Smith has since stressed that he does not believe the man he saw was Gerry, and Scotland Yard do not consider this a possibility. Last week the McCanns were told officially by the Portuguese authorities that they are not suspects.&quot;[1]</p>

<p>In 2008, the private investigators re-interviewed Martin and Mary Smith and the e-fits were created based on that.[1]</p>

<p>The investigators included the e-fits in their report. But the report wasn&#39;t released because it &quot;was hypercritical of the people involved . . . It just wouldn’t be conducive to the investigation to have that report publicly declared because . . . the newspapers would have been all over it. And it would have been completely distracting.&quot;[1]</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Quotes on coincidences:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“The probability of a certain set of circumstances coming together in a meaningful (or tragic) way is so low that it simply cannot be considered mere coincidence. ” 
<strong>― V.C. King</strong></p>

<p>“When two things occur successively we call them cause and effect if we believe one event made the other one happen. If we think one event is the response to the other, we call it a reaction. If we feel that the two incidents are not related, we call it a mere coincidence. If we think someone deserved what happened, we call it retribution or reward, depending on whether the event was negative or positive for the recipient. If we cannot find a reason for the two events&#39; occurring simultaneously or in close proximity, we call it an accident. Therefore, how we explain coincidences depends on how we see the world. Is everything connected, so that events create resonances like ripples across a net? Or do things merely co-occur and we give meaning to these co-occurrences based on our belief system? Lieh-tzu&#39;s answer: It&#39;s all in how you think.” 
<strong>― Liezi, Lieh-tzu: A Taoist Guide to Practical Living</strong></p>

<p>“The concept of randomness and coincidence will be obsolete when people can finally define a formulation of patterned interaction between all things within the universe.” 
<strong>― Toba Beta, Betelgeuse Incident: Insiden Bait Al-Jauza</strong></p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not bad but I have a few criticisms: </p>

<ul>
<li><p>The alleged &quot;food code&quot; was made up by some guy on 4chan and should not be considered evidence.   </p></li>
<li><p>The email about &quot;walnut sauce&quot; is irrelevant as there is video footage of Podesta making it.   He really is a chef.    </p></li>
<li><p>there are three food emails that don&#39;t make much sense: &quot;hot dog stand in Hawaii&quot;, &quot;pizza related&quot; handkerchief map and &quot;dominos on  cheese or pasta.&quot;   I&#39;m not even sure the food references should be mentioned at all beyond saying some of them are strange.   Better to link the Podesta&#39;s to Comet Ping Pong.  </p></li>
<li><p>Needs more artwork from Tony&#39;s house.   The alleged &quot;jeffrey dahmer&quot; statue is by sculptor Louise Bourgeois.   She has not claimed she was inspired by Dahmer, though the similarities are interesting.  </p></li>
<li><p>More of Jimmy&#39;s instagram should be featured.  </p></li>
<li><p>Luzzatto is absent.  </p></li>
<li><p>the punk rock posters prove nothing and are a waste of space.   Instead of showing those pictures they should show the kim noble poster and stills from Amanda Kleinman&#39;s music video &quot;The Neutered Noel.&quot;  </p></li>
</ul>

<p>I believe she is just referring to the pictures/footage. Like I can&#39;t imagine her opening Movie Maker to splice some footage up or photoshop to touch up the photos. The coverage is &quot;raw and uncut&quot;. Thinking the baby is a big deal she sets up the blog after its born and then clearly loses interest over time.</p>

<p>Otherwise good post</p>

    <div class="md"><p>see this was one of the few things you said that gave me pause to re-evaluate the situation.   but it turns out, like much of the &quot;evidence&quot; that it may be just misinterpreted/ misrepresented.</p>

<p>much of what you question whether or not it could be &quot;coincidence&quot; is being heavily leveraged by your interpretation.  if you really want to understand how people with the opposite opinion think, you have to step outside of your bias.</p>

<p>when you say that &quot;maybe it&#39;s a coincidence that the shops around comet use pedo symbolism&quot;, i say- that is too broad an interpretation of pedo symbolism.  the ampersand in the prose and politics sign?  crossed ping pong paddles?  it appears to me as pareidolia.  </p>

<p>again, when you think about cognitive bias- is your reaction to my perspective an emotional one?  as much as you can say &quot;why would the media be spending so much time debunking this if it wasn&#39;t true?&quot;, the same thing goes for how you interpret evidence.  If I tell you that I don&#39;t see most of these things as evidence of a pedofile ring, because I don&#39;t even see them as coincidences- i see people misinterpreting facts to suit a narrative they were already emotionally invested in, what&#39;s your internal response?  Is it to look at it from my perspective, or is it just to discredit me because it feels like I&#39;&#39;m attacking you.  I&#39;m not attacking you, but i suspect that this feeling about pizzagate is internalized, because i just don&#39;t personally see this investigation as very analytical.  And in this case- i don&#39;t even see it as cherrypicking so much as I see a lot of just plain misinterpretation.</p>

<p>The hastert thing is a bit of a red flag as far as I&#39;m concerned- though he&#39;s not necessarily a pedo as much as he is a predator/ sociopath.  the antinous profile picture is demonstrably a red flag which leaves less room for interpretation- but these point more to grooming gay teenagers than to satanic ritual child trafficking.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve viewed all of the facts over and over again, and given my critiques over and over again (this isn&#39;t my first reddit acct). For my own peace of mind, I&#39;m not going to dive too far into specifics. I&#39;m tired. But I do want to speak up and you can take it or leave it:</p>

<p>The investigation has uncovered evidence that these people are corrupt (shocker). It has uncovered that they are a bit fucked up in the head (another shocker). What it has not uncovered is evidence of child abuse. None.</p>

<p>I&#39;ll dig into one, just one thing: The entire case for interpreting the emails as pedophilia rests on the post of one person on one 4chan thread. It&#39;s obvious that pizza and handkerchief do not mean the dictionary definitions, unless someone types the most retarded emails when they&#39;re drunk. What isn&#39;t obvious is that our assumed definitions of these are true. If we assume that our definitions of pizza and handkerchief are possibly false, the ENTIRE narrative crumbles.</p>

<p>Now look, I&#39;m not saying that the investigation isn&#39;t worth performing. It is. But the trail has run cold and in the absence of new information, people started adding in really dumb shit like comparing drawings from crimes and saying &quot;looks similar, PROOF!&quot; This further undermined the entire investigation, especially when people started lumping the evidence together and included the dumb shit with it.</p>

<p>I love a good conspiracy theory, and I&#39;m very convinced that there is one to be found. I am not at all convinced that it is what people think it is. We don&#39;t know how they use code words and until we do, we don&#39;t know what we&#39;ve uncovered. Everything beyond that was confirmation bias.</p>

<p>If the investigation is to get anywhere, it needs to be restarted from the top in a small, closed group of people so that people cannot inject false information into the investigation and then propagate it as the narrative. The people holding intelligent conversation and legitimately investigating the data with an open mind were quickly drowned out by a flood of unreasonable voices. Maybe those were CTR, maybe they were someone else, maybe they were just a bunch of dumb kids. I don&#39;t know. All I know is I watched reasonable people downvoted and blatantly false information massively upvoted. The narrative was hijacked by someone, and so was the investigation.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Your complaints are valid.   However the food references are not particularly significant in my view.   They are only significant insofar as they led to Comet Pizza.   The reason people lept to the pedo conclusion is because of the article quoting (unnamed) NYPD sources who stated that Clinton was herself directly involved in underage sex with Huma and had traveled six times to Jeffrey Epstein&#39;s sex slave island.  </p>

<p>Now, it may well be that you&#39;re right: these are deeply disturbed individuals but not criminals.   Their strange response to the scandal does not appear to support this view, but perhaps you&#39;re right.   It would be quite easy to put the matter to rest if the people being accused just explained themselves.   Instead they are bizarrely claiming everything is &quot;fake news&quot;.   </p>

<p>If Comet turns out to be a dead end, which it probably will, I still think people should investigate potential child trafficking links to the Clinton Foundation.   Those efforts are underway as we speak on the Voat Pizzagate site.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Absolutely. That&#39;s why I think the investigation is of value and needs to continue. I just think it needs to be conducted more privately where outside influences cannot interfere (injecting theories with no credibility and then upvoting them, while downvoting logic). I also think it needs to be scrapped and it needs to be considered from a fresh, new perspective. That goes far beyond something I have time for, I&#39;m afraid, or I&#39;d gladly attempt to take a lead at it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve tried debunking several statements about PizzaGate before, but never this many. Hold on tight!</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The pedo symbols on the two businesses next to and across from comet, one of which works with &quot;at risk youth&quot;, are a coincidence.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So, I looked it up and this is what <del>fake</del> &quot;alternative&quot; news websites are claiming:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Speaking of at-risk youth, right across the street from Comet Ping Pong is non-profit called Terosol that specializes in “homeless and runaway youth.” Their homepage features a picture of Hillary Clinton. It also features their logo — a heart within a heart — which the FBI lists as a symbol for “girl lover”.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>First of all, Terosol is <strong>not</strong> a &quot;non-profit that specializes in at-risk youth.&quot; It&#39;s actually a Bistro &amp; artisan gallery. It describes it self as an &quot;Intimate cafe featuring traditional French cuisine &amp; a boutique selling artisan handcrafts.&quot;</p>

<p><a href="https://www.google.ca/maps/place/Terasol+Bistro+%26+Artisan+Gallery/@38.9551035,-77.0701924,20.1z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x89b7c9b9988325db:0x4cfe7adb0fcd6d8!8m2!3d38.9551394!4d-77.070151">Source</a></p>

<p>The claim that it has a picture of a heart in a heart as their logo is also wrong. <a href="http://www.terasolartisans.com/bg-1-25543.jpeg?u=2782170726">Here</a> is the above portion of their homepage. Just flowery stuff. But no heart-in-a-heart.</p>

<p>They <a href="https://archive.is/IQwRH">used to have</a> a heart in a heart symbol, but removed it from their homepage between November 6 and 14, judging from the archive links. But the heart in a heart symbol is actually quite commonly used. <a href="https://www.google.ca/search?q=heart+in+a+heart&amp;amp;client=safari&amp;amp;rls=en&amp;amp;source=lnms&amp;amp;tbm=isch&amp;amp;sa=X&amp;amp;ved=0ahUKEwi47sTqsNjQAhVK64MKHWTBDUoQ_AUICCgB&amp;amp;biw=1280&amp;amp;bih=739#imgrc=ru2okqLngkcn3M%3A">Just look.</a> Just because it&#39;s been used by a few pedos doesn&#39;t magically mean you can retroactively call all those who have some form of that image pedophiles. They most likely removed it due to the massive amount of backlash by, uh, &quot;concerned&quot; citizens.</p>

<p>The only true statement is that their homepage has a picture of Hillary. There&#39;s another picture of Madeleine Albright too. This is most likely for advertising purposes, like &quot;hey, look, famous people come here!&quot; </p>

<p>There are also claims that a charity across the shop, <a href="http://beyondborders.net">http://beyondborders.net</a>, is funded by the CF. I was unable to find any evidence of this.</p>

<p>Now, for the second of the two businesses. From the same &quot;alternative&quot; news website, it claims:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Incredibly, another pizza place on the same block, Besta pizza, also has a pedophile symbol as their logo, in this case, “boy lover.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That logo is a triangular logo, since pizzas are triangular. Google &quot;triangular logos&quot; are you&#39;ll find many such logos.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The pedophilic artwork created by Sasha Lord for rock performances at Comet...</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I looked this up, and there&#39;s more info <a href="http://www.washingtoncitypaper.com/arts/music/blog/13081294/what-comet-ping-pongs-show-posters-say-about-its-music">here</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“Post(er) Apocalypse,” a show at Wild Hand Workspace in Brookland, surveys a mess of flyers from the past two years of shows at Comet. The prints represent a collaboration between ubiquitous D.C. promoter Sasha Lord, who’s made the restaurant a destination on the local-music circuit, and Magickbat (aka Jourdan Betette), the artist Lord has tapped as her go-to flyer designer for most of Comet’s shows since 2012.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So, Sasha Lord is someone who basically creates posters for these performances and organizes them. Here is how she describes herself on her website:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>SASHA LORD IS A BOOKER AND PROMOTER WITH A GOOD EAR
AND EYE WORKING WITH EMERGING TO LEGENDARY BANDS IN THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Here is some of her poster art: <a href="http://www.sashalordpresents.com/poster-art/">http://www.sashalordpresents.com/poster-art/</a></p>

<p>It seems completely normal to me.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Sasha Lord working with &quot;at risk&quot; girls in juvenile detention is a coincidence.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Actually, she graduated with a degree in literally working with at-risk populations:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Sasha Lord worked at Black Cat 2001-2005, graduated from George Mason University in 2005 in <strong>Therapeutic Recreation specializing in working with At-Risk Populations.</strong> In 2003, Sasha Lord was a outdoor facilitator at Hemlock Overlook specializing in At-Risk Populations.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I mean, she spent years studying for this, so it doesn&#39;t seem strange.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The painting, now removed, of a guy jizzing while playing ping pong with an alien and the words &quot;Shut up and Fuck&quot; was inappropriate for an all ages establishment, but these guys are just sex crazed, not pedophiles.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That doesn&#39;t really indicate anything to do with pedophillia, I agree.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Having a sleepover at a pizza restaurant involving both children and adults isn&#39;t that unusual (?) It&#39;s a community place.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That seems normal.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Tony Podesta&#39;s art collection, which specializes in images of children, babies, abused children, dead children, cannibalism, pigs, pig-human hybrids, and photographs of naked kids..</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I debunked this already:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Marina Abramovic, whose &quot;art&quot; revolves around satanism, pedophilia and cannibalism, is just an attention whore. Shock art is her gimmick.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I believe Podesta declined to go to a dinner with her.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It is a coincidence that the painter Scott G. Brooks, associated with the Comet crew, paints pictures of babies and toddlers and half-pig-half human babies and toddlers being tortured, sexually abused, and fed excrement [warning NSFL]</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I don&#39;t see how Brooks is connected to Comet.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Tony&#39;s close life long friendship with pedophile &quot;Denny&quot; Hastert is a coincidence....</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If Tony was involved, then he would have been arrested too. </p>

<p>OK.</p>

<p>No, just food. The food references need context.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>The raw and uncut time is yet another one of the countless things that are so vague anyone can twist them into meaning anything. </p>

<p>As for the &quot;entertainment&quot; sentence, keep in mind she was talking about her own kids and was referring to their visit to a farm. Are kids entertaining at farms? Yes or no? I can personally attest to kids being entertaining at apple farms!</p>

<p>Vague references to food + no context to us outside observers + <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareidolia">Pareidolia</a> + Backmasking fallacy + hatred of Clinton/Soros conveniently expressed with this made-up controversy + winding down of U.S. elections and thus no boogeyman to bash anymore + narcissistic individuals looking to boost their egos by pretending they&#39;re &quot;saving children&quot; = </p>

<h1>PizzaGate</h1>

<p>As a sidenote, something you all should read:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backmasking">Backmasking has been a controversial topic in the United States since the 70s and popular during the 80s and 90s, when allegations from Christian groups of its use for Satanic purposes were made against prominent rock musicians, leading to record-burning protests and proposed anti-backmasking legislation by state and federal governments.</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>to be honest, I was riveted and thoroughly convinced about pizzagate since Podesta emails first started flowing. The moment I began losing interest was when the Abramovic/Spirit Cooking stuff first popped up. People talking hysterically about satanism and human sacrifice.. </p>

<p>I&#39;m not a fan of Abramovic in the slightest, but she is well-established and respected in the art world, and she got that way by doing edgy, avant-garde, controversial shit. A lot of the artwork related to pizzagate falls under that category. The edgier, the better for some people -- they eat it right up. But it&#39;s art -- and freedom of expression. Embracing works of art as evidence of pedophilia made the whole thing feel more like a witchhunt than anything, and it makes for an easy defense: people fear what they do not understand.</p>

<p>That being said, there&#39;s plenty of art-unrelated aspects of this investigation that are beyond compelling. I keep coming back because it&#39;s impossible to dismiss some of this stuff, and the consequences of being wrong and doing nothing here are too high.</p>

<p>Again, I&#39;m not a fan of the &#39;art&#39; that&#39;s been intertwined in this whole thing -- in fact, art mostly confuses me or pisses me off. I don&#39;t personally have an appreciation for it, but I respect that some people do, and that is their right to exercise. I just wanted to share where the investigation soured for me, and perhaps for others as well. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Lets entertain the idea that everything is true.  What makes you think that doing the investigation in a public forum is a good idea?  Can you imagine if criminals had access to police files as an investigation developed?  Sure would be easy to plant some misdirection up the path a little way.</p>

<p>About your 4 points at the bottom:</p>

<p>I don&#39;t have sources for some of this info so it&#39;s hard to evaluate in most cases.  </p>

<p>Did you verify DKIM on ALL emails related to the evidence you are presenting?  One big thing about all the emails is that only a portion of them are signed.  The news story about DKIM went a long way towards making people forget to check.  You have to throw out emails that don&#39;t have DKIM if you want verifiable info as there is no valid chain of custody.</p>

<p>Where do you get the info that John deleted his emails on date that McCan went missing?  You would have to show that he didn&#39;t delete email on other days to show the behavior as aberrant.  Even then it&#39;s very little to go on.</p>

<p>I did see the &quot;raw and uncut&quot; email and the ages.  It&#39;s definitely an abnormal statement, but how do you investigate that.  The only people with the kind of access to catch something like this would be the NSA.  I mean hackers could set up a trap of some sort but it would have to be an elaborate plan.</p>

<p>In the end what you have is a bunch of circumstantial evidence.  There are no bodies.  There is nothing that lets you prove to anyone anything but what you pointed out: these people say and look at some creepy shit.  The real problem comes when people who want to believe get a hold of this.  They are far more easily led down rabbit holes.  They could easily be led to something that gets them in trouble or that they jump the gun on and harass innocent people.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If a few wealthy folk get swept up in it by associating themselves with child molesters, so be it. It&#39;s like getting taken in for questioning because you were a friend or significant other of a high up crime organization like drugs, money laundering etc.. If the people that are &#39;innocent&#39; give valuable input that can put bad people away, what is the harm? </p>

<p>I think they should have chosen their friends more carefully if they&#39;re kicking it with pedos . . .</p>

<p>These are valid questions people are asking, and the MSM is completely ignoring so much of what has been presented and have not questioned for dug like they should as &#39;respected&#39; journos.</p>

<p>Do you recommend we just take this one at face value and blindly accept what the MSM and FBI tell/don&#39;t tell us? The implications of this are staggering. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well I doubt that any respected journalist would have had time to vet anything enough to print a full story on something like this.  This is something that should take a year to investigate and document in private before it goes public.</p>

<p>Again, the biggest point I&#39;ve made is that if you guys are correct about everything in pizzagate, then the strategy of doing an investigation like this in public is just going to feed the bad guys all of the info you are uncovering and then they can mislead you easily or avoid you entirely.  There is no way something as powerful as what is proposed goes down like this.  Their very existence would prove more competence than is needed to avoid something as obvious as an investigation that they can watch unfold.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Think for youself.</p>

<p>I can indeed think for myself.  </p>

<p>That I choose to question something that you believe does not mean that I am not thinking.  If you actually believe I cannot think for myself and am mind controlled somehow, that&#39;s just a way of propping up your own ideas in your mind and shoving out unwelcome thoughts, which is exactly what you are implying I&#39;m doing.  So basically I&#39;d just advise leaving off statements like this as it&#39;s circular and hostile.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes the crime is awful.  The claims about this particular crime are particularly awful and extravagant.  where are the victims in this case?  I realize that if the situation is as many claim, and pervasive, then the police would likely not be a safe route.  The issue here I have is that people are assuming guilt.  People often start responding to any criticism of methodology or fact gathering with emotive appeals to the nature of the crime.  That&#39;s not an argument for anything more than extreme vigilance and being careful not to dismiss something.  So yeah, I don&#39;t really think you just drop any thought that this is possible.  I just think that a responsible journalist would do a year long secret investigation and have overwhelming evidence before accusing someone of a crime of this magnitude.  That&#39;s the other side of your statement.  The crime is really really awful.  So we should also be careful about accusing people of it before we have enough solid evidence.</p>

<p>Julian got framed for &quot;rape&quot;,   and no matter how possibly guilty Podesta and the others may seem to be,   until you can show that a single law has been broken,   you are just as likely to have been played as to have found a real crime.    Maybe this would be a good time to learn about what is entailed in proper investigations,  because the victims out there deserve it,  but also innocent people like these who were wrongly put through hell:    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kern_County_child_abuse_cases">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kern_County_child_abuse_cases</a></p>

<p>As what?   If they didn&#39;t break the law,  what do you have?    Do you want new laws so that what they did,  the pictures they own for example,  become criminal?   Because right now,  what you got,  everything they did was legal.</p>

<p>If this is some big government cover-up, why not suppress the sketch that &quot;exactly matches&quot; the Podesta brothers?</p>

<p>I mean, if I was a rich and famous and powerful person and I was powerful enough to run a child pedo ring in the basement of a pizzeria and have the media more or less know about it, or at least know that they&#39;re covering something up, I wouldn&#39;t, like, allow someone to sketch me as a suspect. I would have that person killed or replace the sketch with a sketch of a minority.</p>

<p>I see links to emails where the links say &quot;If they&#39;re not speaking code then these emails make NO SENSE!&quot; Well, yeah. If you read my emails, you would probably find some that make no sense. I&#39;m not speaking code. I&#39;m just not writing <em>to you.</em></p>

<p>Someone actually went into that pizza place and fired a gun. A gun. While families were dining there, presumably with children. Does that bother you, like, at all? </p>

<p>And why should journalists have to work to prove that this isn&#39;t true? The burden of proof is not on them.</p>

<p>This is nothing more than a witch hunt, and the media did the right thing by ignoring the witch hunt for as long as they could. If they had focused on it, it would have been worse, not better. There&#39;s another conspiracy post right now where the top comment is sarcastically saying that we know pizzagate isn&#39;t real because NYT and other newspapers say it isn&#39;t. So obviously you conspiracy theorists don&#39;t really give a shit what the media says; in fact, the more mainstream, the less likely you are to trust it.</p>

<p>That&#39;s as much as I can write. Every time I think about this I become furious.</p>

    <div class="md"><p><strong>If they aren&#39;t suspicious, then showing them would help debunk this theory</strong></p>

<p>This is a <em>perfect</em> opportunity for Mr. Alefantis to stop all this. Explain what #hotard is</p>

<p>Or #murder #killroom</p>

<p>Jesus its not hard, its like he doesn&#39;t wan&#39;t to address the pictures in any specific manner.</p>

<p>If they really wanted to debunk it they would choose 2 or 3 of the most suspicious ones and include them along with some kind of explanation from mr alefantis, showing that this is all a big misunderstanding. Instead they are making ad hominems against the people raising the issues and saying their evidence doesn&#39;t even merit a response. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Absolutely. That&#39;s why I think the investigation is of value and needs to continue. I just think it needs to be conducted more privately where outside influences cannot interfere (injecting theories with no credibility and then upvoting them, while downvoting logic). I also think it needs to be scrapped and it needs to be considered from a fresh, new perspective. That goes far beyond something I have time for, I&#39;m afraid, or I&#39;d gladly attempt to take a lead at it.</p>
