        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>This is something that I feel a bit hesitant about a bit of backlash when posting about but I figured I would anyways with the hope for a healthy conversational debate. When 9/11 Truthers talk about the jet fuel not being hot enough to melt steel beams, though there may have been a multitude of other combustible agents within a massive building and the fact is that there is simply no way of testing these theoretical physics because nothing of the sort had ever happened before. </p>

<p>The question I&#39;ve always wondered is, if there were bombs involved, why would the government try to cover that up with, as has been claimed, poorly animated planes? I mean, really, instead of doing what has now allowed the terrorists to be linked back to our &quot;allies&quot; in Saudi Arabia, why wouldn&#39;t they just hire a few people who actually were from Iraq, offer to take care of their families for life, or threaten their families if they don&#39;t just strap on a suicide vest and bomb the towers? Somebody had already ran a van loaded with bombs into the building a few years earlier, it certainly wouldn&#39;t be difficult to believe.</p>

<p>That would seem to be much more easy to explain to everyone, it wouldn&#39;t require CGI, it wouldn&#39;t require millions of New Yorkers seeing the mirage of a fake plane, the terrorists would be captured on video and then they could directly link it to Iraq with their identification and country of origin and it would be much more difficult to disprove these allegations. Anyways, it&#39;s an honest question that I&#39;m actually quite intrigued to hear your opinions on with no disrespect intended I&#39;d like to hear as logical a response as you can provide to prove me wrong or mislead in some way.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t think the planes were animated or holographic in any way.  I think they were real, and that those claims were disinfo planted to muddy the waters; as was the tactical nuke hypothesis.</p>

<p>As for why the coverup; it was the same with JFK.  They knew that some people were going to question things, so they weren&#39;t trying to bury things completely.  All they were trying to do was make the truth look sufficiently outrageous that the hard materialist/pseudoskeptical atheist demographic would accept it, and then try and shove the government&#39;s version of things down everyone else&#39;s throats, which is what happened.  I got post banned from Above Top Secret for arguing with atheists about pancake theory.  Pseudoskeptics claim that they are performing a public service, but in this case and numerous others, they are actually committing acts of betrayal.  Belief in pancake theory requires deliberate, tenacious myopia as far as I am concerned.</p>

<p>The other major element that the psychopaths rely on when they do things like this, is the degree to which people psychologically need to assume good faith in the government, because most people can not tolerate the idea that their government, who they depend on as surrogate parents, actually consists of predatory, psychopathic monsters.  In reality, government is a crime syndicate and it has never been anything else.</p>

<p>The 9/11 demolition was perpetrated, via the use of nano-thermite cutter charges being placed at the base of the giant rebar trunks of the buildings, with smaller amounts of thermite and other, more minor explosives being placed higher in the buildings, in order to visually exaggerate the effect of the planes&#39; point of impact.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh, I have no trust or faith in my government whatsoever, they&#39;re out for their own interests and will achieve them by any means necessary, regardless of the will of the people in many instances. However, I still don&#39;t know why they&#39;d need the planes at all if they could just say &quot;a cell of Al Qaeda bombers infiltrated the offices of the WTC and strategically detonated suicide vests infused with thermite at key structural support areas, etc.&quot; Seems so much simpler to me. Also, what does Atheism have to do with anything? Atheists are certainly not the most trustworthy of our government, in fact, the vast majority of us are opposed to their daily dirty deeds.</p>

<p>In my experience, there tends to be an overwhelming abuse of Occam&#39;s Razor, to the point where I now cringe whenever I see the expression.  The advocates of pancake theory, for example, seemed to adamantly believe that it was somehow more parsimonious than the idea of controlled demolition with thermite; which I considered insane.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I still don&#39;t really see any correlation to Atheism, since when did the guidelines for simplistic scientific hypotheses become an exclusively Atheist-centric ideology? Just because someone uses the explanation that simple is better doesn&#39;t necessarily mean they&#39;re an Atheist, nor does that mean that is the view of any portion of the Atheist community, not to mention the majority. But I digress, I find both theories to be feasible, but I&#39;d be more easily convinced if there were traces of thermite recovered from the theoretical blast sites at said structural weaknesses, something I would think the government would be inclined to avoid collecting or investigating if they in fact perpetrated the acts.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I can think of five possible reasons why planes were used.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Crashing planes into the towers does not require as much on-site prep time as terrorists coming in and setting charges on multiple levels.</p></li>
<li><p>This allowed the general population to witness the events in real time, instead of just hearing that both towers were demolished by terrorists.  It was hours-long coverage of Americans suffering, instead of one quick moment of horror.</p></li>
<li><p>It allowed the government to implement strict security measures in airports, which gets the population accustomed to sacrificing privacy for &quot;security&quot;.  The Patriot Act and the recent rule 41 changes are more examples.</p></li>
<li><p>It gave the majority of people inside the towers time to get out (possibly).  IF this was a consideration, I think they assumed both towers would be immediately evacuated.</p></li>
<li><p>It was an easy explanation of how the terrorists also &quot;hit&quot; the Pentagon.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>In summation, planes were the most efficient method of creating a day full of media covered terror and implementing more security at the cost of privacy, all while still having a tenuous excuse as to why the towers collapsed.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That sounds like a pretty good Pentagon money &quot;loss&quot; cover-up and Iraq War/War on Terror intensifier/initiate to me, a coldly calculated course of action. I always found it a bit funny, in a dark sort of way, that both the descriptions of the Iraqi WMD&#39;s by the false flag &quot;inside source&quot; and the 9/11 attacks appeared to be inspired by 80s and 90s action films. John Carpenter&#39;s &#39;Escape From New York&#39; for the planes hitting the WTC and the unrealistic description of Saddam&#39;s &quot;spherical glass chemical weapon containers&quot; from Michael Bay&#39;s &#39;The Rock.&#39;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Your question does not come across as sincere, as it conflates fact and fiction, and is addressed at the no-plane crowd only, which is a vocal minority at best among independent researchers. </p>

<p>Forget the <del>jet fuel</del> <em>kerosene</em>, most of it burnt off within less than 10 seconds in the huge, dramatic deflagrations. The debate is all about what happens after initiation of collapse, assuming, <em>arguendo</em>, that initiation could occur in the first place despite the enormous redundancy of the towers&#39; structure. </p>

<p>The smaller, less dense portion of the tower can impossibly crush completely through the taller, denser portion unless there are vast amounts of additional form of energy stored in the system. The known laws of physics and the scientific method are abundantly clear on this. Maximum Impact depth = Length of Impactor x Density of Impactor / Density of Medium. Hence</p>

<blockquote>
<p>the fact is that there is simply no way of testing these theoretical physics because nothing of the sort had ever happened before. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>is a mere, baseless assertion, an appeal to ignorance. </p>

<p>This is the Archimedian &quot;fixed point&quot; from which to work and start to continue all investigation and come back to whenever you&#39;re stuck. Until you don&#39;t get that, or at least the free fall of WTC7, you should not worry your pretty little head about CGI planes, drones, holograms, directed energy weapons, steel-eating termites, tactical nukes or what hit the Pentagon. </p>

<p>Study the physics. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>My question was less about the physics than about the motivations behind complicating the cover-up with planes in the first place rather than simply having terrorist demolitionists be the explanation. I&#39;m not a physicist, but I was saying that no collapse of that sort had occurred before and that there were a vast multitude of factors, from office equipment to occupants to consider when assessing the weight of the upper floors in comparison to the lower floors and what other combustible agents may have been offset by the impact, along with the resulting fires and so on and so forth, not that there was no way of calculating, as I am unaware of and inexperienced with such things regardless. No animosity though.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>

<p>And I am telling you to become aware and experienced. The WHY and HOW don&#39;t matter as long as you don&#39;t understand the WHAT.</p>

<p>There is no &quot;vast multitude of factors&quot; to consider, only these: </p>

<p><code>Maximum Impact depth = Length of Impactor x Density of Impactor / Density of Medium</code></p>

<p>That means if the top portion has 20 floors, and since the top is less dense than the bottom, (Density of Impactor / Density of Medium) &lt; 1, the top cannot crush more than 20 floors of the bottom. It&#39;s that simple. </p>

<p>Otherwise, your question comes across as &quot;what motivation did the killer have, why did he not use a different weapon&quot; before you understand that a murder happened. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Exactly, if there were bombs planted by each of the support columns, why not just have suicide bombers be the bombs themselves and catch them on security cameras? Instead of the 20 or so attackers of the actual event, they could just get one guy per-support column and they&#39;d have a direct link to Iraq as the actual attackers rather than &quot;maybe WMDs.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>For the controlled demo theory, theres a lot more than just attacking a few control columns. If you just chopped the base out it could have simply fallen over like a tree, assuming you could even get enough explosive in to do that via suicide bombers.

However, purely for intellectual edification, I have read and watched a lot of material about 9/11. And as I understand it, the  controlled demolition theory was one of the first to pop up, independent of subsequent ones like replacement planes, fake planes, etc. The controlled demo theory simply states that the planes didn&#39;t take the towers down, but a controlled demo did. The core columns of the controlled demo theory (see what I did there?) basically state that there was a demolition. They don&#39;t necessarily question the existence of the planes, just that they didn&#39;t do the work the official story claims. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That makes sense, I just wonder if it were indeed the government and they wanted to demolish the buildings how would they have known that their demolition would coincide with the terror attacks and why wouldn&#39;t they just demolish it via their own agents without the added loss of life so they could better control the story. Essentially the government wouldn&#39;t need both the plane and the demolition, but if the terrorists had set some sort of explosives on the structural support that would seem to make much more sense. I don&#39;t deny that the government did some very shady, constitution-shredding things after the attack, via the Patriot Act, NSA, enhanced interrogation, Guantanamo and the like, but I think that if that attack hadn&#39;t happened they would have found some other occurrence with which to implement it anyways, though they may have known it was coming and simply allowed it to happen without a hitch.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Look up the dancing Isrealis. The mossad knew in advance without a doubt, and if they did we did. The plane plot was needed to blame the demo, as placing tons of controlled charges over quite a period of time would imply a large cover up and inside help.

    <div class="md"><p>The Freemasons in the United States evacuated New York beforehand, I have no doubt that there were those who were warned, but I&#39;m not sure if it was orchestration or the lack of action. I don&#39;t know why they&#39;d employ the Saudis to carry out the attacks though, either they weren&#39;t very thorough, or they weren&#39;t planning on any investigations whatsoever. Either way, it&#39;s still unforgivable.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Conspiracy theorists would say that the government knew about the attacks in advance or orchestrated them outright to advance an agenda. If you take that view, then the planes become almost a moot point, in that the demolition was planned regardless of actual events. Allegedly, the towers were in severe need of upgrades and asbestos removal, which would have cost billions. If they tried to demolish them outright, there would be serious concerns about air quality from the debris. Also, there would have been a serious outcry from the public, as the buildings were so iconic. But if there was foreknowledge of an attack, and the attack was allowed to happen, you kill several birds with two jets. You get rid of buildings that contain financial information, including incriminating evidence; you free up literally the most expensive real estate in the entire world; and you get to go to war. As for the loss of life, if such a cabal was as craven as all that, well then, those who died were collateral damage. Allegedly. According to conspiracy theorists. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>There are several different plane theories, and not everyone buys the holographic/cg plane theory. To me, it wouldn&#39;t make sense to <em>not</em> use real planes. Whether someone was in the cockpit doing the steering is something I&#39;m not sure of, we&#39;ve had the ability to remotely fly planes for at least half a century now.</p>

<p>Planes could have been used for greatest visibility, remember this was the narrative used in the Pentagon attack, as well. A place that is so well secured a terrorist could not enter with a bomb strapped to their chest. Security of the towers would be in question if infiltration was the public narrative, something the Bush&#39;s have a connection to.</p>

<p>A sudden explosion of two towers also wouldn&#39;t have enough eyes on it, there would need to be something else leading up to it which would bring it to everyone&#39;s attention. The planes crash into the buildings, give everyone an hour for it to spread through the vine and tune in, then start the main event.</p>

<p>When you say there may have been other combustible agents present you&#39;re on the right track, but give up by saying there&#39;s no way of testing the physics as it&#39;s never happened before.</p>

<p>Airplane collisions and fires have occurred in high-rise structures both before, and since 9/11. The act of using explosives for planned structural demolition has been around in America since mid-19th century (~1850). Fires, while unpredictable, have always been a constant subject of study. Accelerants, incendiaries and explosives most often leave chemical signatures.</p>

<p>It all has happened before to varying degrees, and if you were to say &quot;but never on this scale!&quot;, that&#39;s okay. Formulas and functions based on solid principles of scientific law scale indefinitely. You don&#39;t necessarily have to learn physics and thermodynamics, but it would help you see the same thing some of us are seeing.</p>

<p>A localized bomb on the ground floor of the WTC would have to be extremely powerful to do enough damage to the building to cause it to topple, which would have done substantially more damage to New York. Nearly all the core columns would have to be severed (some columns were 52&quot; x 22&quot;!), and at least part of the exterior columns. It would have been in a terrorists best interest to make it as messy as possible, so toppling would have been preferable. In fact, it would physically be easier to do so, rather than having it collapse the way that it was observed to.</p>

<p>Also, read &quot;allies&quot; as &quot;business partners&quot;, not &quot;friends&quot;. During damage control, you&#39;ll notice that limbs are often sacrificed to save the body. With the paper trail, it was easier to point the finger at Saudi Arabia publicly and cover for them behind the scenes. Allowing 9/11 victim&#39;s family&#39;s to sue Saudi Arabia is still being blocked... for now.</p>

<p>We&#39;re not even sure who these &#39;alleged hijackers&#39; were, or if they even existed in the capacity the commission wanted us to believe. Several of them are still alive (and not terrorists) and none were seen that day at the airports that the final flights took off from.</p>

<p>Yes, they could probably have forced/blackmailed some actually people to suicide bomb the towers, but that wouldn&#39;t be enough to bring them down...</p>

<p>They needed the horror of people jumping off the 90th floor and the towers being demolished...</p>
