        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Someone in another post claims there is &quot;literally zero evidence&quot; and challenged me to provide information suggesting otherwise, here is the result. </p>

<p>James Alefantis, owner of Comet Ping Pong pizza, is according to GQ one of the top 50 most powerful people in Washington. It is undeniably odd a pizza shoppe owner would be listed among the likes of Hillary Clinton, David Patreus, Chuck Schumer, Paul Ryan, Ben Bernanke and others. This alone could be explained away simply by the level of access he has to powerful politicians, considering many are regulars. That could be the case if it ended there, which it does not. Another notable fact verifiable by public record is he has visited the White House a handful of times between 2010 and 2014. </p>

<p>A powerful person in particular he is known to have multiple correspondences with via email is John Podesta. </p>

<p><a href="https://www.wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/?q=&amp;mfrom=&amp;mto=+jamesacorp%40gmail.com+&amp;title=&amp;notitle=&amp;date_from=&amp;date_to=&amp;nofrom=&amp;noto=&amp;count=50&amp;sort=6#searchresult">https://www.wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/?q=&amp;mfrom=&amp;mto=+jamesacorp%40gmail.com+&amp;title=&amp;notitle=&amp;date_from=&amp;date_to=&amp;nofrom=&amp;noto=&amp;count=50&amp;sort=6#searchresult</a></p>

<p>In one of them it is shown they are at the very least friendly, discussing doing something together(Alefantis suggests having dinner at his place) after an event to be held at Comet.</p>

<p><del>Additionally, Alefantis and Tony Podesta can be seen getting rather chummy. It is worth mentioning that Tony Podestas art collection is at best, questionable.

<p><del>There are many more, but I feel this is a sufficient subset to illustrate the nature of his &quot;artistic taste&quot;.</del></p>

<p>Edit: I am terribly sorry, he does not own those paintings. These are the ones he does own(<a href="http://pizzagate.wiki/images/thumb/0/01/Biljana_Djurdjevic_Seemingly_Deceased_Girls_in_Swamp.jpeg/1000px-Biljana_Djurdjevic_Seemingly_Deceased_Girls_in_Swamp.jpeg">http://pizzagate.wiki/images/thumb/0/01/Biljana_Djurdjevic_Seemingly_Deceased_Girls_in_Swamp.jpeg/1000px-Biljana_Djurdjevic_Seemingly_Deceased_Girls_in_Swamp.jpeg</a>)</p>

<p>Moving on to David Brock, founder of Media Matters and ex-boyfriend of Alefantis. Brock and Alefantis were defendants in a lawsuit by Brocks former domestic partner, William Grey. Grey threatened to contact the IRS and Media Matters donors with damning financial information regarding Media Matters, whos tax exempt status is a matter of debate to this day as a result of questionably partisan actions. The suit ended in a settlement, with Brock paying Grey $850,000.

<p>Representing Brock and Alefantis in this case was Max Maccoby, son of Michael Maccoby. We will come back to them in a moment, but first we must look at a man named Frank Winstead. In 2008 at an Advisory Neighborhood Commision meeting, then comissioner Mr. Winstead accused Comet Ping Pong owner(Alefantis) of wishing to turn the area into a haven for rape and murder only to be drowned out by a crowd of Comet Ping Pong fans. In the recording of the meeting found here:</p>

<p><a href="https://sites.google.com/site/mitalgandhi/anc3fmeeting">https://sites.google.com/site/mitalgandhi/anc3fmeeting</a> Filename: ANC3FmtgPart2-COMET.mp3 </p>

<p>Micheal Maccoby can be heard saying(Timestamp 32:40):</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I will personally remove anyone who opposes Comet Ping Pong!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Original story here: <a href="http://voices.washingtonpost.com/rawfisher/2008/06/dc_official_outdoor_seats_at_p.html">http://voices.washingtonpost.com/rawfisher/2008/06/dc_official_outdoor_seats_at_p.html</a></p>

<p>Michael Maccoby did volunteer work for a charity group. NPH USA, formerly known as Friends Of The Orphans. A member of the Board of Directors of FOTO being his son, Max Maccoby. This leads us to a man named Jorge Torres. </p>

<p>Jorge Torres, then going by the name of Jorge Puello, posed as the legal adivsor  to a missionary group(New Life Childrens Refuge) founded by a woman named Laura Silsby in a 2010 case regarding the attempted child trafficking of children belonging to a collapsed orphanage in Haiti, going by the name of Friends of The Orphans of Haiti. Laura Silsby, not having the proper authorization to transport orphans, served 6 months jail time in Haiti for &quot;arranging irregular travel&quot;, reduced from child trafficking. </p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Life_Children&#x27;s_Refuge_case#Jorge_Puello">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Life_Children&#39;s_Refuge_case#Jorge_Puello</a></p>

<p>Back to Jorge Torres-Puello. A man under investigation for sex trafficking in El Salvador, and wanted in the US for human smuggling across the US-Canada Border. An offense he ended up serving jail time in both the US and Canada for after being extradited from the Domincan Republic in 2010, following the arrest of the NLCR charity group he claimed to be legal representation for. </p>

<p>An internal document(dated 2008) from NPH(again, formerly known as FOTO) states the orphanage in question(Kay St. Helene Orphanage) was home to over 450 children, a number reported by an article submitted by FOTO(dated Jan. 2010) to be 350. </p>

<p>Now we look at a document present in the Clinton email leaks. It illustrates a plan for the rescue of Haitian orphans. Please review the section titled &quot;The Plan&quot;, specifically bullet points 2 and 4. </p>

<p><a href="http://archive.is/QBV6S">http://archive.is/QBV6S</a></p>

<p>Bullet point 2 suggests that on January 23rd, A bus will <strong>gather 100 orphans from the streets and collapsed orphanages</strong>, then return to <strong>The Dominican Republic</strong>. This is believed to be the discrepancy of 100 between the 2008(NPH doc), and January 2010 FOTO article written 10 days prior to the suggested date of the mission. </p>

<p>Bullet point 4, the &quot;Haiti Team&quot;, where Laura Silsby and the other members of NLCR that were arrested in 2010 are listed. </p>

<p>Enter the WJC Good Will For Haiti Award: <a href="http://archive.is/1Yo4l">http://archive.is/1Yo4l</a>
Recipient of the award for 2012 was Gena Heraty and the subject of a fund raiser launched by Bill Clinton, which raised $10 Million(<a href="http://archive.is/nmk2n">http://archive.is/nmk2n</a>). Her business in Haiti was Director of Special Needs Programs for NPH. In 2013, she was attacked at the St. Helene Orphanage(<a href="http://archive.is/77kjX">http://archive.is/77kjX</a>), aka Friends of the Orphans of Haiti. The same orphanage the children Laura Silsby and other NLCR members were caught with at the Haiti-Dominican Republic border belonged to. </p>

<p>A blog post(<a href="http://mollyinhaiti.blogspot.com/2009_09_01_archive.html">http://mollyinhaiti.blogspot.com/2009_09_01_archive.html</a>) belonging to a woman who doing charity work in Haiti(2009), coincidentally a woman who with her sister was scheduled to meet Bill Clinton at the school they were working at one day but never did(<a href="http://archive.is/Q75wg">http://archive.is/Q75wg</a>) mentions in the blog post Vern and Mary Sue, where she says Mary Sue works at the US embassy in the Dominican Republic at the time of the earthquake. </p>

<p>Page 67 of &quot;Inspection of Embassy Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic&quot; confirms a woman by the name of Mary Sue Conway holds the title of Consular at the relevant embassy.(<a href="https://oig.state.gov/system/files/168266.pdf">https://oig.state.gov/system/files/168266.pdf</a>)</p>

<p>Page 4 of &quot;Consular Corner, July 2011, by: Liam Schwartz&quot; under the section heading &quot;OIG Inspection Report of Embassy Santo Domingo&quot; 
further confirms this.(<a href="https://oig.state.gov/system/files/168266.pdf">https://oig.state.gov/system/files/168266.pdf</a>)</p>

<p>Page 23 of a conference participant list(Building On Success: Providing Todays youth with better opportunities for tomorrow) Mary Sue Conway is listed as &quot;Abduction Chief of The Office Of Childrens Issues&quot;.(<a href="https://www.juvenilecouncil.gov/2006nationalconference/participantlist.pdf">https://www.juvenilecouncil.gov/2006nationalconference/participantlist.pdf</a>)</p>

<p>Laura Silsby upon her arrest claimed an unspecified official in the Dominican Republic was the source of her &quot;authorization&quot; to transport children across the border.(<a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748703422904575039761361995340">https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748703422904575039761361995340</a>)</p>

<p>Page 7 here: <a href="http://archive.is/vNAAY">http://archive.is/vNAAY</a> under the section heading &quot;Thomas and Vern - Secret NPH Task Force for Special Operations&quot; illustrates a disturbing picture involving the use of Vern and Mary Sue&#39;s special needs son Thomas to identify other special needs children.</p>

<p>An alleged Packistani Intelligence File lists Mary Sue Conway as a CIA Operative out of the U.S. Consulate General, Johannesburg(<a href="http://archive.is/gJQk9">http://archive.is/gJQk9</a>)</p>

<p>Finally, Laura Silsby now known as Laura Silsby-Gayler as well as simply, Laura Gayler, is now part of the executive team for AlertSense. A company that handles Amber Alerts for the government.(<a href="https://www.alertsense.com/company/executive-team/">https://www.alertsense.com/company/executive-team/</a>)</p>

<p>You sure they aren&#39;t actually investigated due to some <em>crime</em>?  </p>

<p>How many people are investigated where there is no crime, but just because they <em>might</em> have done something, anything?</p>

<p>But surely you can acknowledge this circumstantial evidence is more than sufficient to elicit an investigation from those who do posses the legal power, no?</p>

<p>If that was the actual case it wouldn&#39;t be all that difficult to actually point to whatever law that agrees with what your writing, or to get an officer of the court to corroborate that this is the way that justice is served, no?  </p>

<p>Because it seems that you&#39;re either mistaken or confused about what justice is or how it works.<br/>
If the police was to go investigate without direct evidence pointing to a crime, they won&#39;t get to go investigate any further than your regular person, because the police would still need a warrant to actually enter any premises, and how would you get a warrant with only circumstantial evidence, but not of any specific crime? And if the police was to go investigate without the proper paperwork in place, well whatever evidence that they <em>might</em> find, would be inadmissible in court anyways.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Exactly! Now you are actually getting it.   </p>

<p>The police don&#39;t really have the resources to investigate everything and everybody that might look fishy either, that&#39;s why it&#39;s usually a good method to actually start with a crime, and then work your way from there. They especially don&#39;t have resources to investigate something that will have zero chance of reaching court, because the investigation was questionable to start with.</p>

<p>A pretty sad kind of irony to this whole thing would be if amateur investigators was to mess up the evidence and forever ruin the chance of getting it into court if something illegal had actually happened.  </p>

<p>It also seems pretty likely that any of the persons that already has been named in this, could be expecting to get investigated, and if they actually was involved in illegal activity, that all the attention would have made them get rid of incriminating evidence already.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Completely agree, definitely relevant. But I think the whole point of publicly posting this kind of stuff was to force law enforcement to take action if they haven&#39;t already/weren&#39;t aware of the more suspicious aspects.</p>

<p>The thing about that though, is that we would never be made aware of a current investigation into such things for the very reason you provided.  </p>

<p>But since we can&#39;t possibly know if an investigation exists or not, we&#39;re damned if we do and we&#39;re damned if we dont.</p>

<p>If we do, we risk spooking the people of interest and fucking up an ongoing investigation if there is one. </p>

<p>So by a risk management analysis, the cost of not doing anything means any potential wrong doing results in greater risk than pointing out something that may not even exist in the first place.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Since there are still no victims or evidence of any crime, as far as i know and as of yet only circumstantial evidence has been presented, this doesn&#39;t weigh very heavily.  </p>

<p>This then would have to weighed against the damage, that it does to named people getting accused publicly of child molesting. Plus the resources and time spend on an investigation - which if done illegally someone would need to be compensated for.   </p>

<p>And you would also have to weigh in the precedence it would set for future investigations, if this was investigated on only circumstantial evidence but no crime, what would keep people from getting anyone they didn&#39;t like investigated, because they might have done something.</p>

<p>It&#39;s not really possible to determine what weighs heaviest, that&#39;s more a matter of opinion. But there&#39;s no way in a democracy that circumstantial evidence should weigh heavier than peoples basic legal rights, just consider how many wars have been fought and how many people have died to secure those rights, they shouldn&#39;t be set aside just because of &quot;circumstances&quot;!</p>

<p>You have cirumstantial evidence of a theory. You do not have circumstantial evidence of a <em>crime</em>.</p>

<p>Examples circumstantial evidence of a crime:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Blood at his business/home</p></li>
<li><p>Strange, close, and/or volatile relationship with a missing child</p></li>
<li><p>A crime scene</p></li>
<li><p>A paper trail</p></li>
<li><p>An actual body</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Direct evidence of a crime would be:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>A victim or witness testimony, or an accuser under penalty of perjury</p></li>
<li><p>Video of the accused committing a crime</p></li>
</ul>

<p>These are examples of evidence <strong>of a crime</strong>. PG doesn&#39;t have <em>any</em> of these. A proper investigation starts with a crime, then finds suspects. PG is working backwards. They started with suspects, and are actively looking for evidence of an actual crime.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yep, agree with this. I don&#39;t think JA or Comet have much to do with anything. The insta posts and imagery at CP are suspicious, but it appears more like a homage to something that goes on within the elite circles, which JA may have found himself on the fringes of at some point due to his connections. If the PG investigators are trying to link CP to killrooms, underground tunnels and child rape in back rooms they&#39;ve lost the plot entirely IMO.</p>

<p>My point is that there won&#39;t be any trial without a crime.  </p>

<p>In a criminal investigation the police is investigating on behalf of the DA, and it&#39;s still the DA that has to open the investigation, and they wouldn&#39;t have legal reason to do so without evidence of a crime.  </p>

<p>But who says there isn&#39;t an ongoing investigation happening? It isn&#39;t like the police have to answer to the public about who they are or aren&#39;t investigating, how many investigations would be needed to actually <em>prove</em> this guys innocense*? Wouldn&#39;t you always be able to find circumstantial evidence if you don&#39;t have to connect it to a certain crime?   </p>

First, this: </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Michael Maccoby did volunteer work for a charity group. NPH USA, formerly known as Friends Of The Orphans. A member of the Board of Directors of FOTO being his son, Max Maccoby. This leads us to a man named Jorge Torres</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Is an incredibly tenuous connection. NPH (formally FOTO) is a large and well established charity that received high marks from charity watchdogs. Jorge Torres looks like a sleazeball who put himself forward as Laura Silsby&#39;s NLCR legal council in Dominican Republic.</p>

<p>Literally the only connection that I can see you making between Jorge Torres and NPH is that the orphans Silsby was trafficking were from a ruined NPH orphanage.</p>

<p>To get back to pizza you need Maccoby, a lawyer who you say sat on the board of NPH and also acting as legal council for  Brock and Alefantis (though you dont provide any source for that). </p>

<p>Alefantis and Brock are apparently at least on friendly terms with Podesta. </p>

<p>So you need 3 connections to get a child abuser associated with Alefantis.</p>

<p>Connection one involves two organizations (NLCR and NPH) &#39;interacting&#39; insofar as NLCR improperly absconded with children who were once housed in an NPH facility that was destroyed in an earth quake. Does not seem like a very strong connection to me.</p>

<p>Connection two involves a lawyer who represented a client and also sat on a board. Lawyers typically have hundreds to thousands of clients, none of whom are connected. Hell, Ive been represented by a lawyer who Id bet also has represented criminals. I would hope that doesnt tarnish me. Its also a very very weak connection.</p>

Such is the nature of circumstantial evidence. Multiple pieces used to corroborate each other. Thats how it works. That asside I have additional info about a direct connection Alefantis has to a registered sex offender. Cant share anymore without doxxing.</p>

<p>Agreed. But how many lawyers who sat on this oh so legit charity BOD have fathers that have been recording saying they will &quot;Personally remove anyone who opposes Comet Ping Pong&quot;?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No doubt. The bands that play at comet pizza, plus the people involved in the production of their music videos, plus the artists who painted the murals at the pizza shop, plus the artists whose work is collected by the podesta brothers; all of it is questionable because it depicts children as sexual objects, violent scenes, etc. there&#39;s a good reason this stuff is raising eyebrows.</p>

<p>On a different note, let&#39;s say that evidence were being collected and federal investigators were as convinced as we are that the podesta sand company are involved in human trafficking, etc, you and me would not hear about it until charges were brought up.

<p>James Alefantis, owner of Comet Ping Pong pizza, is according to GQ one of the top 50 most powerful people in Washington.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>How is GQ magazine the ultimate authority on who the most powerful people in Washington are, such that you can take a shitty click bait article from them as the Gospel on the matter? How does this defend pizzagate in any way whatsoever? Are you arguing that the author of that article was privy to the child sacrifices performed in the basement of his pizza restaurant, and knew the power this would give him over the political elite, and therefore put him on the list?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It is worth mentioning that Tony Podestas art collection is at best, questionable.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Much of this is objectively false. These paintings <strong>are not</strong> in Podesta&#39;s house.</p>

<p>It is a common misconception widely spread about the topic. One of the first pizzagate posts on reddit said, &quot;Keep in mind that this house contains art showing child abuse by Biljana Djurdjevic&quot; and it linked to <a href="https://twitter.com/northofdoom/status/795019411497177088">this tweet</a>, which says, &quot;Art by biljana djurdjevic, a fav of tony podesta&quot;. It was other art by Djurdjevic. If you actually open the article at <a href="http://washingtonlife.com/2015/06/05/inside-homes-private-viewing/">the bottom of this page</a>, the Djurdjevic paintings hanging in Podesta&#39;s home are <a href="http://i.imgur.com/DZ5XWux.png">Synchronized Swimming</a> and <a href="http://i.imgur.com/0vekdCZ.png">Garden</a>.</p>

<p>Podesta does not own the paintings you posted. That is objectively false. Now the question is if you genuinely didn&#39;t know, or if you&#39;re intentionally lying to try to trick people.</p>

<p>And the rest of your post, and the connections it makes, are insanely strenuous. You&#39;re insinuating, <em>literally</em>, that because James Alefantis&#39; ex boyfriend&#39;s lawyer&#39;s dad worked for a charity group where a woman who worked there also founded a missionary group that had a legal advisor who was implicated in a human trafficking case, it serves as evidence for the claims that James Alefantis rapes and murders children in the basement of his pizza restaurant.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I only took logical conclusions from what you said. </p>

<p>If a shitty click bait article from GQ magazine featuring Alefantis <em>doesn&#39;t</em>, in your mind, suffice as evidence that he rapes and murders children in the basement of his pizza restaurant, then why would you include it at all in your post detailing that there is evidence to pizzagate&#39;s credibility?</p>

<p>If James Alefantis&#39; ex boyfriend&#39;s lawyer&#39;s dad working for a charity group where a woman who worked there also founded a missionary group that had a legal advisor who was implicated in a human trafficking case <em>doesn&#39;t</em> serve as evidence that James Alefantis is a child rapist, then <em>why would you include it</em> in your post explaining that there is evidence for pizzagate&#39;s credibility?</p>

<p>You see this kind of shit with pizzagate all the time. People present a lot of things that any reasonable person knows damn well doesn&#39;t serve as evidence of any sort, circumstantial or otherwise, to defend the claims their making. But because they presented <em>so much stuff</em>, it&#39;s suddenly evidence for their claims. </p>

<p>Even though none of what they said is evidence for their claims, because they said a lot of stuff, they insinuate that this and this alone suffices as evidence even if nothing else does.</p>

<p>Either James Alefantis appearing in a shitty click bait article from GQ magazine does or does not suffice as evidence that he rapes children in the basement of his pizza restaurant.</p>

<p>If it doesn&#39;t, then <em>don&#39;t include it</em> in your presentation of all the evidence for this heinous accusation. If there is literally no way for you to explain, logically, that this defends your claims, either by itself or by its logical connections to other things that you can explain logically, then it has no business being in such a presentation of evidence.</p>

<p>The relevant passage describing the artwork:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Laura Wainman wrote a <a href="http://washingtonlife.com/2015/06/05/inside-homes-private-viewing/">piece</a> on Tony&#39;s home, published for Washington Life on June 5, 2015. In it, Tony lists Louise Bourgeois and Marina Abramovic (of &quot;spirit cooking&quot; fame, see first paragraph above) as among his top five favorite &quot;artists&quot;. But the first &quot;artist&quot; in Tony&#39;s collection mentioned in the article is Serbian painter Biljana Djurdjevic. Here&#39;s a selection of her work (more photos available here and on her website).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The article describes the pieces as other samples of the artist&#39;s work, not pieces that are part of Podesta&#39;s collection.  Does anyone have an image of the Djurdjevic piece that <em>is</em> in Podesta&#39;s collection?</p>

<p>The speaker (who I identifies himself as Michael Maccoby) is referring to stopping his elected official&#39;s <strong>attempt</strong> to stop what he perceives to be a benefit to the community. Stopping an attempt is completely different from &quot;removing&quot; someone.</p>

<p>Even if you want to believe it was a threat to a person, it would have been a threat to remove an <strong>elected</strong> person from their office. At worst, this is a threat to try to get people to vote against someone in the next election. Nothing wrong with that.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The entire Jorge Puello story is also misrepresented.</p>

<p>I outlined in another post exactly why that Fox interview shouldn&#39;t be taken as evidence with regards to PG:</p>

<hr/>

<p>The graphic tries to connect <em>Friends of the Orphans</em> (the above mentioned children&#39;s charity) with a Silsby&#39;s group. The problem here is that Puello <strong>faked his identity</strong> to the missionaries&#39; <em>families</em> (not the missionaries themselves) and the media. And he <em>never</em> officially represented the missionaries. <strong>He did not have the facts, or authority, to make the claims he made in the Fox interview.</strong></p>

<p>The timeline of events shows just how superficial this &quot;connection&quot; is:</p>

<ul>
<li>January 29, 2010: 10 American missionaries are jailed</li>
<li>January 31, 2010: &quot;Mr. Puello called up an Idaho church where five of the 10 Americans attend, offering <em>pro bono</em> legal services. <strong>Two relatives called him back and accepted</strong>, and Mr. Puello then began acting as the group’s lawyer, even though he lacked a law degree.&quot;</li>
<li>February 2, 2010: The Fox interview referenced above takes place.</li>
<li><p>February 11, 2010: The NYT figures out the that the lawyer was misrepresenting himself</p>

<p><strong>Sources</strong>:</p>

<p>The same <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/02/16/world/americas/16haiti.html">NYT article</a> referenced by OP that conveniently leaves out relevant facts,</p>

<p>and an <a href="https://www.ice.gov/news/releases/fugitive-who-posed-lawyer-following-haitian-earthquake-sentenced-3-years-federal">ICE press release</a> which corroborates all of the above information.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Even folks over at <a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1530630">voat</a> have noted that there is no connection between Puello and the children&#39;s charity, <em>Friends of the Orphans</em>, other than that he &quot;knew that it existed.&quot;</p>

<p><strong>TL;DR: Puello misrepresented himself to the <em>families</em> of <em>some</em> of the missionaries, and to the media. The missionaries themselves have NO CONNECTION to <em>Friends of the Orphans</em> other than the fact that the POS Puello knew of its existence. The graphic misrepresents the facts so that you believe in an alternative reality.</strong></p>

You haven&#39;t proven at all that they have anything to do with the child trafficking, at best you&#39;ve proven they are tenuously connected (not even directly) to people that have or may have engaged in child trafficking. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The last point is the most iffy, but I still find that the connection between Laura Silsby and James Alefantis/the Podestas is too tenuous. Alefantis is the owner of a very popular restaurant in a city more rich with powerful connections and networks than any other, besides maybe NYC. There are bound to be dots to connect whether or not those connections are meaningful. Podesta himself is a very powerful and connected man, so a &quot;connection&quot; isn&#39;t automatically damning, or even suggestive without something more.</p>

<p>Further, there&#39;s not even enough to label Laura Silsby a sex trafficker, though I&#39;ll admit she was mixed up in fishiness. THAT part of it might make an interesting conspiracy theory (that she was indeed trying to sex-traffic those Haitian children - supposedly with the consent of the ENTIRE FOTO organization there), but because we still don&#39;t have reason to label her a sex trafficker, any connection drawn to her (even direct) wouldn&#39;t be damning. </p>

<p>Also I just wanted to point out that the Frank Winstead piece of evidence really isn&#39;t strong at all. The article you linked makes it clear that he was overreacting about the outside seating CPP was trying to develop. </p>

<p>I dunno. Nothing more than a mild fish smell here as far as I can see. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>At the risk of getting my head chopped off, I just don&#39;t see it. I keep coming back to this conspiracy but cannot make the leaps others are making. With 9/11 theories, even the governments theory that Bin Laden did it, there is solid evidence of lies and cover-up. Pizza gate, at least so far, looks to me like wild speculation.</p>
