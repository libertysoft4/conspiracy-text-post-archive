<p>Trump is not an idiot, he won&#39;t ever touch foreign claims of USD as it would be REALLY, REALLY bad for his own personal business and others around him. Same reason why he is running an hypocritical foreign travel ban on some countries.</p>

<p>Is all fake nationalism and you are getting conned just like Obama supporters were conned by all the &quot;Hope.&quot; bullshit.</p>

<p>The ruling class hasn&#39;t changed they still are still basically the same capital globalists with a slight different flavor.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;There does exist, and has existed for a generation, an international anglophile network which operates, to some extent, in the way the radical Right believes the Communists act. In fact, this network, which we may identify as the Round Table Groups, has no aversion to cooperating with the communists, or any other group, and frequently does so. I know of the operations of this network because I have studied it for twenty years and was permitted for two years, in the early 1960s, to examine its papers and secret records. I have no aversion to it or to most of its aims and have, for much of my life, been close to it and to many of its instruments. I have objected both in the past and recently, to a few of its policies but in general my chief difference of opinion is that it wishes to remain unknown, and I believe its role in history is significant enough to be known.&quot; - Carroll Quigley, Tragedy &amp; Hope</p>

<p>Wilbur L Ross - Henchmen for the Rothschild banking dynasty. The Rothschild&#39;s bailed Trump out of bankruptcy in the late 1980&#39;s on Wilbur L Ross advice. Wilbur L Ross said in Bloomberg back in March 2016 that he would back Trump if he runs and that he would make a great leader. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Trump said the TPP and NAFTA were bad deals and that America should sign free trade with countries individually.  </p>

<p>This means Trump could sign a worse deals for the worker and better deal for the 1℅ then the TPP and NAFTA would have ever done with an individual country and not break his promise.</p>

<p>Clinton and Trump are both puppets of Wall Street. The only thing different is Trump wasn&#39;t for a military showdown with Russia like Clinton. </p>

<p>This is the reason why the neoconservatives war mongers in Congress and the Senate went so hard on the speculative Russian folder. They are deluded into thinking that a military showdown with Russia is the way to get their hands on Russian resources and have used this document to try and railroad Trump into a military showdown with Russia.</p>

<p>Reason the Democratic warmongers silence on Trump&#39;s economic plans have been deafening or protested about at times ensured to get as little publicity as possible. If these Neoconservative Democrats had put in half the effort they put into Russian dossier into the risks and pitfulls of Trump&#39;s economic plans then a whole lot more people would be in the streets protesting.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Where has possible ties to Tillerson and PizzaGate been addressed? I&#39;ve been following PG since the beginning and have been trying to keep an eye on Trump and his picks but I&#39;ve fallen behind. I know about one of his people having heavy ties with Dyncorp but it wasn&#39;t Tillerson. Any point in the right direction would be appreciated :)</p>
