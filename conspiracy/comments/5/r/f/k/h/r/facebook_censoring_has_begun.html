<p>The groups that are pushing the censorship on private companies such as (Facebook, Twitter, etc) are the SAME groups that pushed for and orchestrated the &quot;Blessings of Multiculturalism&quot; that Europe is currently &quot;enjoying&quot;.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53A5AJoRxF0">Barbara Lerner Spectre - on an Israeli News broadcast - 2010</a></p>

<p>QUOTING TRANSCRIPT: </p>

<blockquote>
<p>I think there is a resurgence of anti-Semitism because at this point in time Europe has not yet learned how to be multicultural. And I think we are going to be part of the throes of that transformation, which must take place. </p>

<p>Europe is not going to be the monolithic societies they once were in the last century. <strong><em>Jews are going to be at the center of that.</em></strong> </p>

<p>It’s a huge transformation for Europe to make. <strong><em>They are now going into a multicultural mode and Jews will be resented because of our leading role.</em></strong> But without that leading role and without that transformation, Europe will not survive.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Okay, thanks Barbara!</p>

<p>Who is pushing this censorship?</p>

<p><a href="https://archive.is/8AkOB#selection-445.1-445.90">EJC welcomes European Commission code of conduct on countering illegal hate speech online</a></p>

<p><a href="https://archive.is/7P14a#selection-1321.0-1321.36">Facebook, Twitter, Google, Microsoft vow to fight online hate in Europe. Why stop there?</a></p>

<p>From the latter:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>So a united front by Europe and social media elites against online hate is definitely a good thing.
However, this week’s announcement does not address the burgeoning online hate in the US. Hate speech in our country is not illegal but it is no less toxic.
Hate is hate. Why don’t the global social media giants apply the same standard against bigotry, wherever and whatever the source?</p>

<p>It appears from this week’s announcement in Brussels that hate postings, for example about the “Big Lie” of the blood libel (that Jews use the blood of Christian children for ritual purposes), would be removed in Germany within 24 hours, but would remain untouched if posted through a U.S. page.</p>

<p>Why? If the companies set their own terms of use, why not voluntarily expand it to take into account the red flag of hate emanating from sister democracies?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is long-planned end-run around First Amendment Protections on Free Speech in the US, and like the coordinated, FORCED &quot;Multicuturalization&quot; of Europe, Jewish groups are the instigators.</p>

<p>Those folks sure stay busy, don&#39;t they?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>science, nutrition, genetics, neurodevelopmental disorders. my favorite facebook group is &quot;biomedical healing/recovering kids&quot; where i can read posts from 27,000 members talking about treating autism and adhd symptoms with nutrition and supplements, and how the are addressing medical issues like seizures and neuroinflammation. i like some other groups too but i really like that one because of its broad focus and large membership. i read journal articles and talk about the same kind of stuff with people in real life with scientists and parents but where else can i learn from a group of 27,000 parents? i feel like i learn something every day from facebook groups. and being able to post my own thoughts and get feedback is helpful, and i&#39;m the kind of person that if i post &quot;the sky is blue&quot; afterwards in my head all day i&#39;m going to be self-conscious because &quot;actually, Stupid, the sky is pink when the sun is setting and grey when it&#39;s cloudy&quot;. so just being able to post things to strangers motivates me to pick apart my own thinking more, which is a good thing. </p>

<p>Is this all true? 1400% increase in rapes in Sweden? So if there was one in 2015, there were 1400 in 2016? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>100% is the base not 1%. So another way for saying it would be 14 times increase. Most outlets like using % because a large majority of people don&#39;t understand basic math. </p>

<p>&quot;Canada banks only see profit increase of 3%&quot; not a huge greedy number at first glance. Hence the only or just accompanying these phrases. But profit increased. 3% of profit means they have still made a shit ton of more money. </p>

<p>Using % should not be allowed in news because it can be deceptive and misleading. I don&#39;t doubt your an intelligent person, but you and every person who responded didn&#39;t see the major flaw in your argument. And man we&#39;re talking the most basic of math here. Do you see why % is misleading??</p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;Let that sink in for a moment. The neighbor to one of the most affluent, stable, and successful nations on the planet (or at least it was those things) is afraid that Sweden is on the verge of collapse. They’re worried that Sweden’s problems are so severe, that they’re going to spill over their border and wreck their country as well.&quot; </p>

    <div class="md"><p>i thought a large part of the large increase in rapes in Sweden was a change is what was classified as rape? For example, it&#39;s how Julian Assange was wanted in Sweden for &quot;rape allegations&quot; that were actually about consensual sex with a broken condom.  </p>

<p>This. We can&#39;t all abandon the zombified echo chamber. There is a war going on there between redpillers and sleepwalkers and some, like OP, are on the front digital frontlines.</p>
