        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>So another user who says he&#39;s a long time lurker has decided to bail. Why?</p>

<p>Because supposedly this subreddit has been taken over by Trump supporters.  They then go on to talk about Nazis and all that other shit.  So I want to take a change to rebut this. </p>

<p>First, I&#39;m not a Trump supporter. I think he&#39;s very polarizing and confrontational. People either love him or hate him, but nobody is able to ignore him. Just my opinion, but I see him as an independent who suckered the GOP and won by running as one of them. I also think he&#39;s a distraction. How so?</p>

<p>The media go after Trump and a very few of his policies (Wall, immigration) while ignoring the big stuff that&#39;s going on. Stuff like a former Exxon CEO for Sec of State... or all the former Goldman Sachs people in his administration.</p>

<p>People love associating Trump with Hitler and Fascism. But this is a trick and here&#39;s how it&#39;s working. First, the comparison itself is a form of deception. People are being deceived into seeing something that isn&#39;t really there. The fascism is real, but it&#39;s <strong>not</strong> coming from the Trump side. It&#39;s coming from his opponents. Yes, that sounds crazy... but it&#39;s true.</p>

<p>Remember that the Nazis were <em>not</em> conservatives. They weren&#39;t ever right wing. In fact, they were the exact opposite. They were all about social change. They practiced a union of government and business under government control. They introduced all kinds of social programs and new social attitudes (starting to sound familiar?)</p>

<p>Today, the people that are closest to the Nazis aren&#39;t the GOP or Trump. It&#39;s the politically correct SJW types. These are the people who want a union of Big Business and Big Government coupled with a huge platform of &quot;correct social attitudes&quot; to which everyone is expected to conform. These same people are also incredibly intolerant of anyone who does not conform to their ideology.</p>

<p>This is where Trump comes in. He&#39;s there to serve as a boogeyman. He&#39;s there to act as a threat and an opponent. He&#39;s there to energize these people into a much more cohesive and militant group.</p>

<p>I think the next 4 years are going to see the social Left go through some serious changes and President Trump will serve as a catalyst. Fascism is coming. But it&#39;s going to come from the Left. TPTB want to use opposition to Trump as a means of <em>accelerating</em> the rise of fascism while simultaneously acting as a distraction from the real source.</p>

<p>This is politics. Nothing happens by accident. If something does happen, you can bet it was planned to happen that way. So when I see a wide variety of people suddenly unifying against a perceived opponent, it makes me think that someone intended things to go this way.</p>

<p>That&#39;s what the user is encouraging man, why are you being so negative?</p>

<p>There&#39;s not so much to question when the answers are right there man, why do you ask for comments about me when I said the user is encouraging people to ask questions, not that I&#39;m the one that always asks, I like this type of encouragement because it reminds me I should never eat whatever they want me to.</p>

<p>Why did you get personal, though? asking for personal comments? We all know that&#39;s a stupid technique, I never said anything about me so that&#39;s irrelevant, you are only showing your true colors and you should feel bad.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Obvious fear-mongering seldom works here.</p>

<p>This is not 1975, the cold war is over. The Reds aren&#39;t a threat, we don&#39;t have to worry about those Commie Rat Ruskies.</p>

<p>Also, you are correct, this is a sub for conspiracies.</p>

<p>The fact that Trump is awful is brightly lit and out for everyone to see... literally the opposite of a conspiracy.
So we&#39;re disinterested in discussing that here.
We&#39;re more interested in the dark, hidden dealings of the corrupt officials. Trump&#39;s recent choices in his cabinet need to be talked about here, not Putin.</p>

<p>The problem is, we&#39;ve been shown the Democrats are corrupt liars, willing to ignore their constituents in favour of their personal friends. To the detriment of the entire nation, and almost the whole world. I&#39;m not trying to say the Republicans aren&#39;t corrupt in exactly the same way, but the Democrats just recently got Donald Fucking Trump elected with their backdoor, anti-democratic, bullshit shenanigans.
So when these proven liars with an axe to grind and face to save, start to tell me that the guy who embarrassed them is a traitor to his nation and an agent of them Big Scary Reds, without a shred of evidence, mind, it&#39;s really hard to take them seriously.</p>

<p>Also it starts to come off as a conspiracy in and of itself.</p>

<p>It definitely is a national crisis. Though, as a citizen of the world, I&#39;d much rather Trump-turmoil contained mostly within your nation, over Clinton-chaos spread over the whole world.</p>

<p>None of those things involve Russia, Putin, or hacking. The fact that he doesn&#39;t want to put profitable boots on the ground in Russia, doesn&#39;t mean he&#39;s a puppet of the Kremlin.</p>

<p>He campaigned on torture, not just waterboarding, but worse. He campaigned on &quot;taking out families of suspected terrorists&quot;</p>

<p>Yesterday his first strike killed 30 civilians including 10 women and children. Boots on the ground, bullet through an 8 year olds neck.</p>

<p>He&#39;s pissing off world leaders, he&#39;s making us a joke just like Bush did.</p>

<p>My problem is with this sub not discussing the russia connection, or the many stories around it like the mysterious death, or the now arrested Russian spies (very likely outed by Trump and his people)</p>

<p>I said the situation is contained to your country.</p>

<p>He&#39;s making you look terrible, definitely. But that&#39;s the thing. He&#39;s ruining YOUR country, making YOU look horrible. He&#39;s focused on America, rather than the rest of the world. Which is good for us.</p>

<p>I feel as long as there&#39;s an America, there will be American military personnel killing brown people to profit the rich, but if the world can avoid outright war by having America look (somehow) worse in the eyes of the global village, I&#39;m all for it.</p>

<p>As for the second one, the US has been increasing their stockpile since before the anti-proliferation treaty was signed. I assume Russia has as well, because they&#39;d be dumb not to if the US is...
This is no different than Obama or Bush did, or what Clinton would have done. This is a systemic, American political zeitgeist problem, not a Trump problem.</p>

<p>Not that you guys shouldn&#39;t be reducing your stockpile, that&#39;s never been policy.</p>

<p>Exactly. The DNC was corrupt and got their person in. Trump won <em>despite</em> the RNC&#39;s every effort to stop him. I was a big Ron Paul fan, and it&#39;s tiring to have to keep explaining why that &quot;dossier&quot; is way too convenient, considering the people behind it, to be worth considering it as proof of anything. McCain and Graham were the Republicans who supported the Russian narrative? Shocker..</p>

<p>Did you know that a 2% chance, is still a chance? That&#39;s what a long shot is. That&#39;s why when you bet on a long shot you get a higher payout, it&#39;s unlikely, but not impossible.</p>

<p>The unlikely happened, do to a few thousand people across 3 states.</p>

<p>&quot;nearly 50% of people who voted did so for Clinton or Trump&quot;</p>

<p>50% of people didn&#39;t vote for either of them? I think you&#39;re messing up your words.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t see how anyone can complain in a /conspiracy forum that the biggest Cabal candidate lost. Sure you may think Trump isn&#39;t clean either... but the Bushes and Clintons hate him. That should tell you all you need to know.</p>

<p>If Hillary had won, this forum would just be anti-Hillary. Same difference. We just see her as a non-player at this point. There is still work to do. No one should feel the need to defend Trump&#39;s every move, but if you want to cheerlead the Cabal narrative, do it somewhere else. </p>

<p>Here&#39;s a comment from a day ago I posted</p>

<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/5r2un4/sources_trump_executive_order_allowing_antilgbtq/dd3zv78/">&quot;It was bad enough under Obama watch OWS get crushed by corporate boots. Maybe now under a republican people will finally be pissed off enough&quot;</a></p>

<p>Another comment from yesterday</p>

<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/5r11he/donald_trumps_first_us_military_raid_kills_30/dd3nppa/">&quot;Under Obama collateral damage was bad, just like under any president. It was especially bad that we changed the way we count &quot;combatants&quot; to include any male of military age.&quot;</a></p>

<p>I had plenty of problems with Obama, ironically I posted this comment right when you were trying to call me out</p>

<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/5r7n4g/dear_democrats_please_stop_protesting_on_behalf/dd5g22e/">&quot;plenty of us made noise, plenty of us even refused to vote for him a second time and went 3rd party&quot;</a></p>

<p>So I&#39;d love to see what you&#39;re talking about.</p>

I do lean towards duped, but I&#39;m an unrepentact cynic. You have an interesting perspective but I don&#39;t quite see it. Do you agree the neo-liberals and deep state at war with him are also globalists? Are you saying his nationalism is a facade and he&#39;s in bed with them not at war?

    <div class="md"><p>Gestapo agents were duped too. They were also fanatical loyalists who attempted to suppress all desenters of the state at hand. </p>

<p>Neo-liberalism is innately a globalist economic and geo-political agenda (using its brother, neo-conservatism as its hammer)</p>

<p>Considering how much he is attempting to meld in the private corporate apparatuses that run this country with his rule of the state, its hard to tell. At times it looks like there is conflict but at the same time he represents a lot of neo-liberal economic policies, especially on the domestic frontier. Lets see how the next year pans out before I can further go on about that statement. </p>

<p>Well comments like these are intriguing.....</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It’s just one piece of Bannon’s ideological game of chess, rewiring the media landscape to clear the path for a radical reimagining of conservative politics in line with his own nationalist agenda. The president himself, Bannon has admitted in the past, is just one piece of the puzzle. Trump is a “blunt instrument for us,” Bannon told Ken Stern for Vanity Fair last summer. “I don’t know whether he really gets it or not.”</p>

<p>Trump is probably no more than a puppet at this point. It is Bannon that raises the alarm to me. </p>

<p>First, I&#39;m not a Trump supporter...but I see him as an independent who suckered the GOP and won by running as one of them. I also think he&#39;s a distraction. How so?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I think we need to get it straight that Trump couldn&#39;t find his way out of a cardboard box. </p>

<p>He is a useful tool (fool) of Bannon and Pence, the real power behind the throne. His antics and buffoonery distract us from the real nasty shit those two will do.</p>

<p>Again, <em>he is not independent</em> he had the full support of the Republican Party, he ran as a Republican, he is a Republican <em>not</em> an independent candidate in any way. </p>

<p>The fact that the whole of the GOP, barring a handful of elected officials, is supporting him demonstrates that he is in no way independent. He is a Republican.</p>

<p>I personally would argue that the idea of him being &#39;independent&#39; is simply another trick his campaign played on the American people. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree with the majority of what you are saying here.</p>

<p>Both the left and right are being radicalized. Although the left is more likely to become the fascists, the right is moving right along in lockstep with other extreme right groups in other nations.</p>

<p>It was the far right that was manipulated into insurrection in Greece and Ukraine, no? I&#39;m not saying the same scenario will play out in the US. I&#39;m just pointing out previous plays in the game.</p>

<p>I have been saying from the beginning that he&#39;s most likely an oblivious tool for the elite. He&#39;s being controlled by the same people he campaigned against.</p>

<p>When the situation is observed from a distance I see two opposing groups being pitted against each other. Even though Trump is a lightning rod for the left the anger generated is being channeled toward his supporters. It&#39;s not enough that the left has to hate Trump. They have to believe his supporters are SUBHUMANS incapable of empathy or love.</p>

<p>The supposed &quot;Alt-Right&quot;, on the other hand, doesn&#39;t have a lightning rod for their hatred any more in regards to a political figure. Obama, Clinton and team are out of the picture. What&#39;s left? Those in the media and Hollywood pushing the narrative regarding the perception of conservatives?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;Because supposedly this subreddit has been taken over by Trump supporters.&quot;</p>

<p>This is only a half-truth. I&#39;ve been around since 2009, the pre 50k sub days, and I can honestly say this sub is dead now, simply for the fact that we have to wade through so much bullshit to get to the rare good posts that it is no longer worth it. The sockpuppetry really kicked off about 2011, when the tech firms started making it packaged to order, but they kept it relatively low key and focused on front page subs (eg, not this sub as much). They had to wait to get rid of Swartz and take over reddit from the top, and in 2013 is when it really got out of hand, and it has literally been nothing but downhill for reddit and for <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> ever since. It&#39;s not just sockpuppets and shills, it&#39;s also just simply about popularity and numbers degrading the state of discourse. </p>

<p>In the old text only post days, many of us had discussions here that would rival the best posts on Hacker News. I specifically remember when we passed the 100k sub mark, and this was already becoming an issue and was being discussed. The fact of the matter is that there really aren&#39;t that many people who are have expereinced enough of the world, broken through their programming while managing to stay rational (as opposed to falling into the religious trap), so really only a handful (I&#39;d measure it in the few thousands) have the ability to speak on the kind of issues we should be discussing here in any rational and coherent way that is conducive to intellectual discourse that encourages learning and exploration in others.</p>

<p>Even without the sockpuppetry, we have seen it happen with slashdot, with digg, and many others. Reddit is simply falling victim to the double powwow of whatever name for that phenomenon is, combined with the relatively new tech of massive sockpuppetry and shilling manipulation there is almost no hope.</p>

<p>The foundation of mkultra, the manipulation of phschology for the powers that be purposes, has been cemented firmly in subsequent operation mockingbird variations shifted to take over the distribution of information on the internet. </p>

<p>As an old school 90&#39;s hacker, the thing is that we won the 90&#39;s cryptowars and then sat back and all the blackhats turned grey/white and made lots of money during and after the dotcom boom. I think the oligarchy simply underestimated the power of the internet because they didn&#39;t understand it... but they do now, and they are about to pull out all the stops because the internet and the power of decentralized communication among the masses is the number one threat to their power schemes, but due to the rapidly evolving nature of technology it has artifically accelerated their totalitarian dystopian plans, and they are being forced to show their hand before they were ready.</p>

<p>Reddit will fall, it is inevitable. The questions is now, what will take it&#39;s place? Voat is not good enough. Some of the blockchain based websites are intriguing but haven&#39;t manifested themselves properly yet. </p>

<p>I think the beauty is there is a new market about to open up for a good competitor to do it right, and the real discussion we need to be having is how to improve the voting system to prevent manipulations we have seen take over reddit. For example I like the idea of distributing upvotes/downvote ability randomly like slashdot used to, along with mod labelling like slashdot does, or perhaps only allowing limited posting until certain thresholds of community value contribution have been made, things like that. </p>

<p>Sorry bud, I&#39;ve been here since the old days, and honestly, while I still open new on conspiracy every few days, there is so little substance here the sub is essentially dead, and has been that way for a while, but it is now worse than ever. </p>

<p>On that note, the one thing that could save the sub would be a massive round-table by the mods and the community on how to save the sub with large changes to what they allow. Currently their dedication to so little censorship has become their weakness.</p>

<p>I&#39;m reminded of the time I setup a website about saying no to censorship, which I put a bb forum up and left it open for all to use. You know what happened? It turned into a spambot home, and all the original discussion was soon drowned out by the spammers and bots. </p>

<p>I mean, to give a small example, if it were me, I would immediately instate a rule that posts on certain subjects shown to be part of the forum sliding narrative be immediately removed, such as the one line posts that say stuff like &quot;Disprove to me X, or Debunk Y for me, or What do yall think about Z&quot; </p>

<p>No spite to the mods, but I have a feeling the mods of conspiracy have probably been slowly infiltrated over the years and are not likley to take the drastic moves they need to if they wanted to save the sub, so once again, we are back at the conclusion that <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> is dead.</p>

<p>The influx of trump supporters is but a small piece of the puzzle of it&#39;s death, so to simply attack just trump supporters (who aren&#39;t actually the problem when it&#39;s more the brigading Pedes of TD that are the problem) is to miss the big picture here.</p>

<p>This is a good point. Why? </p>

<p>Because the wrong people start paying attention to any sub that reaches a certain number of subscribers. Things weren&#39;t too bad at 100k and 200k. But during this last election, the sub went north of 400k and things got pretty bad.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thank you for saying this.  I was going to make a table comparing trump and hillary over nazism and I got distracted working on trasncribing George Webb&#39;s stuff.  When I get back to it, you&#39;&#39;ll see in a nicely formatted table who is the real nazi and it&#39;s unsurprisingly hillary.  trump hasn&#39;t mass murdered people on at least 3 continents.  Trump hasn&#39;t knowingly run a blood mining program to kill all hemophiliac children (eugenics).  Trump has controlled the media and run lie after lie until it becomes true.  Trump hasn&#39;t gaslighted the public with lies within lies by hiring people to shape a grand illusion through a network of agents.  While it&#39;s true hillary isn&#39;t really a socialist, she&#39;s actually very provably a fascist corporatist, and while she&#39;s running fr office, she&#39;s blackmailing heads of state and toppling countries with weapons stolen from previously toppled countries.  Her private army is gassing innocents, splitting up families and selling the women and children into sex slavery.  She&#39;s used her vast international powers to extort money from the state to enrich her friends, all the while creating a vertically integrated supply chain of human-rights-free human labor, sex slaves and bioproducts all around the world.</p>

<p>Trump may be a part of this, but he&#39;s a passive consumer like so many others involved as investors in the defense industry.  HIllary is directly involved, being that she&#39;s a political operative for the CIA, involved in a system that is doing absolutely atrocious things all over the planet and we can prove it, many many times over.  These things I&#39;m saying to you know may sound absurd to you, but there is proof, and though we&#39;ve only seen about 5-10% of that proof, we have public statements by federal investigators that are telling us that these things are true; and we are correlating them with information by international journalists all around the world; and correlating them with mountains of evidence of the same, collected over decades by intrepid journalists who were harassed, gangstalked and eventually murdered for releasing this information.</p>

<p>The shit is about to hit the fan, and it will happen all-at-once.  You will see a sea change of opinion and at that point, they are going to put every CIA and FBI agent in jail and then let them out one-by-one after a detention period.  Who knows what happens to the NSA, but they will probably have half of their toys taken away</p>

<p>Basically communism.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Basically this is the definition of Fascism.</p>

<p>In both cases the end goal is the same. More power and more control for the people at the top. I&#39;ve heard one criticism of capitalism saying that it just isn&#39;t compatible with democracy over the long run.</p>

<p>But I think the real problem is human nature. Some people always want more... no matter how much they already have. Doesn&#39;t matter what economic system is in place, these people use whatever advantages they have to increase their control over everybody else.</p>

<p>All long as human nature drives people to act the way they do, we&#39;ll always end up in the same situation... A tiny minority lording it over the vast majority.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well said. I try my best to stay neutral (easier said then done) and I&#39;m noticing big changes in the left. They seem to have adopted this hammer &amp; sickle persona. They&#39;ve also been easily provoked into violence and irrational behavior over the slightest questioning of there motives.</p>

<p>It seems really strange to be honest. I use to consider myself a leftist for a while back when Occupy was happening. Back then the lefts anger was poised towards wall street and the big banks. Now everyone is pissed at Trump and he just got elected for fuck sakes. </p>

<p>They can&#39;t seem to break this conditioning though. It&#39;s like tunnel vision. What&#39;s the endgame though? Forcing all these social justice issues down everyone&#39;s throats isn&#39;t going to happen overnight.</p>

<p>Although I have to say after watching that mayhem go down on hwndu I noticed a lot of good conversations being had on both sides. Maybe that&#39;s what needs to start happening more. </p>

<p>If any leftists reading made it this far then this is important for you to know this. You are acting like you are incapable of any compromise. By doing this you are dividing yourself from your fellow man. Trump is the elected president. He&#39;s doing exactly what he said he was going to do. Tighten security and get jobs back to America. It&#39;s been ten days and he&#39;s already got more done then Obama did in eight years. Give him a chance.</p>

The danger lies in the vehemence of the SJW set and the backlash that could come as a result of Trump&#39;s actions. That he is supposed to play this part makes his cabinet selection (is that what you call it in US?) much easier to understand. 
That said, I think he&#39;ll have to ramp up the intolerance to non-white males if he&#39;s truly going to give the SJW set power but maybe he will and is simply working to a timeline.</p>
