<p>No, he isn&#39;t. It&#39;s CLEARLY a PR stunt designed to hide his pivot AWAY from the Britain/Saudi alliance to overthrow the Syrian government, and TOWARD the Russia/Syria/Iran side in Syria.</p>

<p>We&#39;re less at risk of war with Iran than at any time in decades. Go ahead and downvote this post and then repeat your media-produced talking points a second time... OR, go do some research on your own.</p>

<p>Al-Qaeda was a faction of the Mujahadeen just like Ahmad Shah Massoud was one, too. That doesn&#39;t mean that all of the Mujahadeen were one and the same, because they most certainly were not.</p>

<p>The CIA had little motivation to fund al-Qaeda during those years. It isn&#39;t as if the US invaded some country and took their resources under Clinton, so the proof is in the pudding. </p>

<p>Al-Qaeda at that time was an emerging threat after the fall of the Soviet Union, but it wasn&#39;t a well-known one until later in the 1990s. </p>

<blockquote>

<p>Any &quot;lost&quot; nukes were probably grabbed by a state or we would have seen them used by this point, especially by al-Qaeda.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>I fully agree that the US, more specifically, the CIA, has been funding FSA Islamist groups, but they weren&#39;t necessarily al-Nusra itself (though some groups shift allegiance, such as the Islamists with Turkey&#39;s Euphrates Shield). Remember, while ISIS and al-Nusra were under the al-Qaeda umbrella at one time as ISIL, they&#39;ve been hostile enemies ever since they split. (I&#39;ve been following the Syrian Civil War for some time as a pro-YPG Redditor.)</p>

<p>BTW, that document you just showed made a point that I wanted to mention earlier. The Syrian government was allowing AQI to operate out of Syria against the US last decade, so it wasn&#39;t the CIA who were funding al-Zarqawi &#39;s group at that time but regional state actors hostile to the US invasion and occupation.</p>

<p>CNN talking points? Are you saying that Trump didn&#39;t launch a mission to attack al-Qaeda or he hasn&#39;t used bellicose language against Iran? Are you using Trump White House talking points? Is this Sean Spicer?</p>

<p>Which articles are you referring to?</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>That doesn&#39;t mean she was guilty by association. She was a little girl, though I know Trump did say that we have to kill terrorist&#39;s families, so maybe this is part of his strategy. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>If you want more fodder how about all the other women and children killed in the raid?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes, dozens were killed during the raid. That doesn&#39;t sound like a very clean operation with SEALS engaging in firefights killing civilians. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Did you read that the women shot back too? Do you honestly think they are innocent? They knowingly put themselves and their children in harm&#39;s way.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I haven&#39;t heard anything about the women shooting back, though it certainly would make the mission sound rather poorly planned if we are attacking a compound where people lived. How do we even know if they were terrorists?</p>

<blockquote>

<p>I am not talking about the sanctions. Trump has said that military force isn&#39;t off the table. Now, it&#39;s probably that military force wasn&#39;t off the table with Obama, either, but the Republicans have indicated a willingness to &quot;bomb, bomb, bomb Iran,&quot; and that desire doesn&#39;t seem to have subsided with Trump. </p>

If I told them that the current political climate, especially the public and mil support, is perfect for another surge that would not bode well with them. I wonder if there are some neutral folks among them that can analyze everything and deduce there is something afoot.</p>

<p>This guy is as bad as team pizza, in fact I&#39;m sure he&#39;s been implicated in similar shit in the past (previously accused of under age rape on Epsteins island). </p>

<p>This is rigid, &quot;always good or always bad&quot; thinking. It&#39;s incredibly dangerous when thinking about any person, much less a president. </p>

<p>Trump is pivoting away from the policy of supporting ISIS to topple the Syrian regime. I&#39;d read more into that than some shit-talking to Iran.</p>

<p>But it&#39;s best if you don&#39;t read tea leaves at all, and stick to primary sources.</p>

<p>Iran opposes ISIS. ISIS is supported by the US, Britain, and Saudi Arabia, primarily. And opposed by Russia and Iran primarily.</p>

<p>Trump shifted that, and is joining the coalition opposed to ISIS.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If CIA is supporting ISIS, is this intelligence agency civil war?</p>

<p>Not if. It&#39;s proven through leaked documents. &quot;Moderate rebels&quot; (which we supported) =ISIS=Al Qaeda</p>

<p>Sort of. The brass already openly rebelled against Obama&#39;s orders to support ISIS, and was helping Syria and Russia fight them.</p>

<p>I&#39;d prefer a REAL intelligence agency war (like killing every single senior official at the CIA for treason, nuking the building and salting the earth), but I don&#39;t see it happening.</p>

<p>&quot;For we are opposed around the world by a monolithic and ruthless conspiracy that relies primarily on covet means for expanding its sphere of influence--on infiltration instead of invasion, on subversion instead of elections, on intimidation instead of free choice, on guerrillas by night instead of armies by day. It is a system which has conscripted vast human and material resources into the building of a tightly knit, highly efficient machine that combines military, diplomatic, intelligence, economic, scientific and political operations.</p>

<p>Its preparations are concealed, not published. Its mistakes are buried, not headlined. Its dissenters are silenced, not praised. No expenditure is questioned, no rumor is printed, no secret is revealed.&quot; JFK</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Egypt was a world superpower starting from 3150 BC for about 1250 years. Archeologists and historians divide this time into the old kingdom, the middle kingdom and the new kingdom.</p>

<p>You may have heard of the Egyptians.</p>

<p>It was to Egypt that Abraham went to avoid famine. It was into Egypt that Joseph was sold. It was Egypt where Jacob sent Josephs brothers to get food when famine hit Palestine. It was Egyptians who enslaved these people called that history calls Jews till God freed them. It was Eygpt who put an end to Solomons empire after his death. It was Egyptians who probably broke the Judean kingdom at the battle of Megiddo where King Josiah was killed and allowed it to be conquered by the Babylonians.</p>

<p>It was the Egyptians who invented things like hieroglyphics, ink, calenders, make-up, sun clocks, papyrus the plow, breath mints, toothpaste, designed ships that sailed the rivers and in the oceans, worked with gold, glass, and bronze.</p>

<p>The Egyptians also built things like the Pyramids, the Spinx, temples in Karnak and Luxor, etc...</p>

<p>Where is Egypt? </p>

<p>In Africa. For 1250 and beyond it wasn&#39;t a backward shithole. And the way things are going I can&#39;t see U.S. lasting a hundred years let alone a thousand.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The government&#39;s &quot;pursuit&quot; of AIPAC and its predecessor was half-assed at best and corrupt at worst and the latest example is repugnant:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In the 1950s President Eisenhower&#39;s administration repeatedly demanded the leaders of the American Zionist Council register as &quot;agents of a foreign government.&quot;[35] In November 1962 Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy&#39;s Department of Justice ordered the American Zionist Council to register as a foreign agent because of FARA violations alleging it was being funded by the Jewish Agency for Israel and acting on behalf of Israel. The Department of Justice later withdrew its demand.[27]</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The American Zionist Council was reorganized as the American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC). In 1988 former Senator William Fulbright in the 1970s and former senior CIA official Victor Marchetti, unsuccessfully petitioned the Department of Justice to register the lobby under the Act.[36]</p>

<p>The 2005 case of United States v. Franklin, Rosen, and Weissman against United States Department of Defense employee Larry Franklin and American Israel Public Affairs Committee policy director Steven Rosen and AIPAC senior Iran analyst Keith Weissman[37][38] raised the possibility that AIPAC would come under greater scrutiny by the Department of Justice. While Franklin pleaded guilty to passing government secrets to Rosen and Weissman, as well as to an Israeli government official,[39][40] the cases against Rosen and Weissman were dismissed and no actions against AIPAC were instituted.[36]</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Bro as much as I hate bankers n shit, a lot of the bad stereotypes of Judaism come from <strong>international</strong> jews who are opposed (publicly, alas they still bias media towards israel) to Zionism. Anti-Zionist jews talk about non-jews in the most derogatory way in private, seriously check it out on youtube, and they have the banks/education stuff. I&#39;m aware the Rothchilds at one time helped form Israel, but in the context of their role compared to their overall power, it&#39;s not significant.</p>

<p>Anyways we have a unique opportunity with Zionist jews being focused on just living in their lives, I&#39;m not saying Israel is perfect by ANY stretch (USS Liberty, Mossad/Egypt/Sayanim false flag) but give the dude some credit for being open, it&#39;s not easy to willingly be a public target for all the anti-jewish sentiment. I&#39;m a patriotic American and I still hate the CIA with a passion</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Do people forget that when he was campaigning in the primaries when he was proclaiming loudly that he loved war and would have no problem using nukes when it came to terrorism?  </p>

<p>Trump loves saying that Obama &amp; Clinton are the founders of ISIS.   I wonder what the name of the next big terrorist organization that owes it&#39;s creation to Trump will be?   Because, with the poorly aimed ban and pissing war with Iran....he&#39;s well on his way to inspiring a whole new generation. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hillary supported the Iran Deal. She helped craft it before kerry. She wanted the no fly zone in syria. Trump didn&#39;t which is why I voted for him. Iran&#39;s problem is that they admitted too violating the deal. What&#39;s trump supposed to do? Also if we allow Iran to get a bomb that will lead too saudi Arabia wanting a bomb. Does anyone here want saudi Arabia too get a bomb? The next 9 11 with a nuclear saudi Arabia will leave the island of Manhattan a giant irradiated crater.... also look at North Korea Bill Clinton let them get a bomb by letting them develop nuclear power first. Does anyone here think it&#39;s a good idea that north Korea has a get out of jail free card too do what ever they want? When dictators get nukes they get a giant btfo too anyone who wants too try screwing with them. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Okay, so activate the treaty and demand inspections. Don&#39;t put up a red line on fucking twitter and wait for Iran to cross it so you can invade.</p>

<p>It&#39;s all bullshit. This isn&#39;t about preventing Iran from getting nukes. Nobody who pays attention to global politics gives a fuck if Iran gets nukes. They won&#39;t do anything with it. Iran isn&#39;t even anti-US, it&#39;s anti-Middle East intervention.</p>

<p>If I was Iran I would want one too.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I understand, But you missed my point. Do you want everyone in the ME to then want one? Saudi&#39;s are next. I dont blame Iran for wanting them either. Can you imagine if Syria had them? and ISIS got them somehow? Or If Iran does get them and some zionist in Isreal decieds first strike is better? ALOT of people die when the nukes start too fly. MAD stopped Russia and America, Do you think people with a death wish give a fuck about MAD? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m getting kinda sick of americans not waking up and realizing that their government is basically just an extension of the Israeli one. This has now been going on now for many decades but many americans are still oblivious to it. A lot of americans still think that Trump is the real deal because he shit talks muslims and talks about the dangers of islamic terrorism as if islamic terrorism is the number one threat to the american people and not the actions of their own government. It&#39;s just the same old crap that we heard after 9/11 only it&#39;s just more direct now from Trump. It&#39;s just the usual dehumanization of brown folks in the M.E so americans will be less resistant to bombing them. </p>

<p>They just keep getting duped every single election, thinking the person they elect will be different and will make good changes only to later realize that the current president was no different from the last one because the same interest were being pursued. And then the next election arrives and they get duped again...How many times can the same trick work? Just how stupid is the average american exactly?
Their ignorance and lack of action has ruined a whole region and it could even escalate to WW3. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I would also like to add that the dehumanization of the muslim world is way bigger and way more effective now then what it was a decade ago because it is more widespread now then before and that is mostly due to the migrant crisis. 
It was most likely the intentional plan of the EU to bring in as many people as they can from the muslim world without doing any background checks so that even the criminal bad muslims gets to live in some European country. We&#39;ve seen the effects of it, rapes, murder, theft and all of that has increased in Europe and a lot of the perpetrators are from the muslim world(Even though they do not represent the muslim world as a whole because in muslim countries they would be harshly punished) and the EU takes no action to combat it, instead they want to welcome more of them. Why? Because they know that the crimes will not only continue but they will also continue to rise.. This will just create more and more hatred towards muslims within the populations of Europe which is also why the popularity of the far-right is increasing. This is just another way of dehumanizing all of the muslim world as these barbarian thugs that deserves to be bombed and killed. So if America and its European allies would want to start a war against Iran, I’m sure they would get less resistance from the people because after all, it’s muslims that will get killed right? </p>

<p>When I read about the theory I was reading a book about Viking influence in Russia and it was a footnote.</p>

<p>Knowledge of Jewish population in Ethopia is on the internet.</p>

<p>My knowledge that there were Jews in India uInknown to the Jews of Europe I read in a history of the church in the east.

<p>Did you not listen to every single thing Trump has ever said about Iran and the people he has surrounded himself with?</p>

<p>The notion that Hillary Clinton wanted to bomb Iran more than Trump is so, so retarded. All you seriously have to do is listen to every single thing his admin has said in 2 WEEKS on this subject and there has been more sabre rattling and threats than anything Hillary Clinton has ever said about Iran.</p>

<p>It&#39;s now largely a for profit right wing propaganda machine. The most war-like faction of the World Order factions.</p>

<p>Even the stupid &quot;New World Order wants to rule through Socialism&quot; meme is a crock of shit. Oligarchs don&#39;t want socialism. It&#39;s the dumbest fucking thing I&#39;ve ever heard, but it&#39;s a conspiracy movement accepted gospel, because the paid think tanks gaming this movement want it that way.</p>

<p>This focus on a fictional New World Order that might occur, is it&#39;s own Psy-Op, because it makes people want to defend the existing World Order. It&#39;s part of why Trump was elected.</p>

<p>And oh look, it&#39;s business as fucking usual at the GOP mainstream Old World Order Swamp with Trump&#39;s appointees to cabinet.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, well I definitely think that there is a huge threat from the left. Not so much communists, but perhaps it&#39;s like Brave New World vs 1984- the left comes in and teaches people to censor themselves ala BNW, re: SJW. </p>

<p>The right comes in and uses might to enforce censorship ala 1984, re: Trump&#39;s libel laws. </p>

<p>Obviously there would be examples that oppose that &quot;theory&quot; but it just seems a tendency that the left does more brainwashing and the right just takes people already brainwashed and gives them more instructions. Which is why schools and media are left and the military is right. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Reading these comments I pick up it is bec of Israeli agenda. So, I will put out some Biblical prophecy that may give some clues to how/why Israel prominence.  </p>

<p>So JESUS is returning, that was His promise, and it will be to save self destructing world. Before this happens, these things will be in place- </p>

<p>The AntiChrist will come to power and lead a one world gov. that takes cash out of circulation and ppl can only buy and sell if the have a his mark on their hand or forehead (associated with number 666). </p>

<p>The Jewish Temple will be rebuilt. (Why is US embassy being moved to Jerusalem, where Temple is located? Hmmm)</p>

<p>The AntiChrist will sit in the temple to be worshipped as god. This is called &quot;the abomination that causes desolation&quot; in Revelation.  </p>

<p>A great army from the north (of Israel) will attack and the carnage will be unimaginable.  This is Armageddon. </p>

<p>JESUS will return to save world from total destruction. </p>

<p>Keep these in mind when watching powers align and move.  As you know, the cash prophecy is now unfolding before our eyes. </p>

<p>One thing I failed to understand previously, Israel government will be hijacked by NWO players to allow AntiChrist his attempt to usurp JESUS place. Many Christians support Israel, but are not realizing this, my opinion, therefore supporting unjust Israeli actions. </p>

<p>I can&#39;t believe this sub is naive enough to think that anyone who wasn&#39;t gonna play ball would be allowed to become president. seems this sub is in love with Donald and just like the rest of his supporters, are somehow blind to how obviously shady he is. if anyone considers themself a conspiracy theorists to any degree this guy has gotta set your bullshit detector off. </p>

    <div class="md"><pre><code>THE HEGELIAN DIALECT: FALSE CHOICES
</code></pre>

<p><em>One of the great lessons to be gleaned from the world of conspiracies is that of the Hegelian Dialect. In this theory, we are presented with options that inevitably put us where the puppet masters want us through a coordinated series of false events.</em></p>

<p>the choices were either trump or hillary, sadly both serve the same masters. </p>

<p>we were just believed to have a choice while in truth the agenda of the illuminati that was envisioned by albert pike in the late 1800&#39;s and is still right on track, even if they let you believe that you made a choice for the better by picking nationalism over globalism....</p>

<p>ignorance is bliss...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Egypt was a world superpower starting from 3150 BC for about 1250 years. Archeologists and historians divide this time into the old kingdom, the middle kingdom and the new kingdom.</p>

<p>You may have heard of the Egyptians.</p>

<p>It was to Egypt that Abraham went to avoid famine. It was into Egypt that Joseph was sold. It was Egypt where Jacob sent Josephs brothers to get food when famine hit Palestine. It was Egyptians who enslaved these people called that history calls Jews till God freed them. It was Eygpt who put an end to Solomons empire after his death. It was Egyptians who probably broke the Judean kingdom at the battle of Megiddo where King Josiah was killed and allowed it to be conquered by the Babylonians.</p>

<p>It was the Egyptians who invented things like hieroglyphics, ink, calenders, make-up, sun clocks, papyrus the plow, breath mints, toothpaste, designed ships that sailed the rivers and in the oceans, worked with gold, glass, and bronze.</p>

<p>The Egyptians also built things like the Pyramids, the Spinx, temples in Karnak and Luxor, etc...</p>

<p>Where is Egypt? </p>

<p>In Africa. For 1250 and beyond it wasn&#39;t a backward shithole. And the way things are going I can&#39;t see U.S. lasting a hundred years let alone a thousand.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hagee and AIPAC are illegal agents of a foreign government. As with the endless violations of the Symington amendment, they&#39;re given a pass by blackmailed, bought-off &quot;Presidents&quot;, because dufuses believe the Hate-State is needed &quot;to make Jesus come&quot;.</p>

<p>This will not last. The U.S. will not last, in large part because of the soul-destroying acts it&#39;s committed for <em>Israel</em>.
