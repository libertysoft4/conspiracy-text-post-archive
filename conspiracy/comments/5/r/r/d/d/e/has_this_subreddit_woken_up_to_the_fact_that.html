<p>The anti Christ will come in and be loved by all the people. This person is hated by all the people, they could vamp him and make him &quot;expose&quot; the corruption, reveal all the cures, drop the bait.</p>

<p>Once the bait drops you know 90% of the public is going to fall for it like cheese on a fucking trap. In 3 years if a massive fake coup is made it could be done.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Pizzagate is a symptom of a much larger disease. Pizzagate and pedophilia are merely used as the ultimate binding contract. The Illuminati, Elites, etc believe themselves to be a non human species, they have kept technology hidden from us and they have kept us in the dark for a very, very long time.  These Elites basically use us and keep us in the dark to further their own goals (mainly based around transcendence). </p>

<p>Look back to Trumps inauguration address, he said we are going to &quot;unlock&quot; the mysteries of space. He didn&#39;t say discover because they&#39;ve been locked away. You should check out the Joe Rogan Alex Jones podcast, it&#39;s pretty dope. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The Trump echo chamber is slowly being drowned out - but it will never fully die. I&#39;ve got nothing against his supporters and I, myself, was willing to give the man a chance. Unfortunately, the current administrations tone is becoming more war hawkish everyday e.g. putting Iran on notice, threatening NK, easing Russian sanctions, abusing allies and speaking derogatorily of the UN and NATO.</p>

<p>There&#39;s a few of us that are researching conspiracies related to Trump and his team, which as conspiracy theorists, is our duty - no matter who is in office.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>As someone that did vote for Trump I genuinely believe he is not like the evil elite half of you think he is.</p>

<p>First of all, his field of business is hotels and properties. Casinos, housing. Nothing inherently bad about that. There are the Hiltons, Marriot Hotels as well that are strong competitors. Of course there are global relations, but I believe this to be strictly business. </p>

<p>Second, he took his name dragged through the mud, shit on, dragged again by almost all media worldwide in his election. Why is this? The global powers and powers behind closed doors don&#39;t want him- it&#39;s obvious. He poses a huge threat. Clinton was quite literally pushed into competition and strung around like a puppet to bring down Trump, despite not being healthy enough to compose a debate hopped up on meds.</p>

<p>Third, he&#39;s a bold man and holds his personal views on immigration etc. These seem to be acts of personal interest for him as well as his love for the country (which has gone to shit under Democrats overall- domestically) </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Give the dude a fucking chance. Yes, there are very suspicious things surrounding him but he hasn&#39;t even been in office 2 weeks. That being said, George Webb made some Dyncorp connections with Trump that I&#39;m curious about. I&#39;m sure most people here are aware of the Erik Prince connection too. It&#39;ll be interesting but no, I personally have not reached the conclusion he&#39;s everything the conspiracy world has fought against. </p>
