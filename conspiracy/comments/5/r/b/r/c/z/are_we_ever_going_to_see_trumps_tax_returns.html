<blockquote>
<p>On Inauguration Day, Trump apparently filed his candidacy for 2020. Beyond being unusual, this opens up the ability for him to start accepting “campaign contributions” right away. Given that a sizable fraction of the campaign funds from the previous cycle were paid directly to the Trump organization in exchange for building leases, etc., at inflated rates, you can assume that those campaign coffers are a mechanism by which US nationals can easily give cash bribes directly to Trump. Non-US nationals can, of course, continue to use Trump’s hotels and other businesses as a way to funnel money to him.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It is very relevant, otherwise he would have released them, as he said he would &quot;happily&quot; do. If revealed, we would know who he is in debt to, if certain vodka-producing foreign powers (not Poland) have contributed to his coffers, and get a better picture of the enormous webs of potential conflicts of interest that will mar his presidency...all doubts which could be calmly resolved if he would release them. He said he would about a hundred times, then Kellyanne Conway said last week, of course he won&#39;t. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>His tax returns are literally nothing more than a talking point to stir people up.  Neither the Democrat or Republican or shadow elite or George Soros, or anybody who matters, give a literal shit about his tax returns.  The tax returns are a great little media device to stir some shit up in the public, and they were sort of fun to bullshit about during the debates.</p>

<p>Is there something amiss with his tax returns?  I bet.  Does anybody besides the public really care or plan to do anything about it?  Probably not</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Just had a thought. They will probably wait until they start to revise the tax code.</p>

<p>When they are ready they will release them. The MSM and people will go ape shit because he probably pays little to no tax (maybe even got a refund). </p>

<p>Then they will say - look the system is rigged! We need to change the rules!</p>

<p>This will force the establishment&#39;s hand to pass whatever tax legislation Bannon and Mercer have planned.</p>
