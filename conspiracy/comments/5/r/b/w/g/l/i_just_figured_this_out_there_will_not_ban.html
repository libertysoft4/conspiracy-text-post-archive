        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I posted earlier in the &quot;gay&quot; thread (on the top of this sub) after somebody was complaining it was a political post. I replied that that&#39;s fine because some conspiracies are political in nature.</p>

<p>My comments were met with some upvotes at first, then tons of downvotes.</p>

<p>The downvotes did not bother me, but I was surprised because even my most controversial comments usually don&#39;t get downvoted on this sub.</p>

<p>Thinking about it, I realized that banning political talk will be a way of censoring this sub without banning it all together. It will also eliminate a much-needed alternative perspective for Reddit. </p>

<p>This is one of the few subs that isn&#39;t completely against Trump, and while some of you dislike Trump, it still provides us a little opportunity for alternative viewpoints.</p>

<p>It is dangerous when we eliminate all alternative viewpoints. In addition, it&#39;s impossible to be perfectly unbiased. I have a strong feeling this subreddit will soon face a &quot;no politics&quot; rule.</p>

<p>Thoughts?</p>

<p>Edit: title got messed up...sorry.</p>

<p>First off - fph was never a &quot;place,&quot; it was a convenience - as is every other sub. It&#39;s simply an aggregation of words &amp; thoughts and the safety of never venturing outdoors to either state or collect an opinion from anything real. </p>

<p>Who knows where the conspirators will go if they shut it down? It&#39;s not exactly like there&#39;s a shortage of internet. </p>

<p>Balance. That&#39;s what&#39;s required here. Because who knows? u/spez could get caught in a hurricane tomorrow &amp; reading shit from that guy? He&#39;d probably demand Reddit beburied with him. </p>

<p>What does that even mean? Speaking practically, Reddit is your host &amp; you are a user. </p>

<p>Same as a physical space when someone hosts a party &amp; you attend. Host says it&#39;s over - you get out. </p>

<p>The more Reddit kicks people out of the party, the more they&#39;ll congregate elsewhere. It&#39;s pretty easy to work out. Basic human nature &amp; all. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It always catches my attention when benign posts are down voted.  It seems like people are actively trying to discourage you from participating when that happens.  This sub does an excellent job of pointing out manipulative voting, posting, and posters.  This is old news to you, though.  I am glad to see it didn&#39;t discourage you but I expected nothing less.  :)</p>

<p>Often, the most important conspiracies relate to politics.  I think that some people who are not aware of or dismiss the big conspiracy theories don&#39;t make the connection to how something tied to politics could be associated with a conspiracy theory.  Then, they call things out as pro-Trump, which is understandable from the amount of anti-Trump propaganda in the mainstream media, or call the sub a politics sub.</p>

<p>I also feel that it is more than just that.  We have a community here that goes beyond the topic of conspiracies.  I have even met someone who I share a special bond with here.  ;)  We are likeminded in that we are critical thinkers; attempting to see things from all angles.  I feel that the community should be valued above all else and I think it is safe to say that we are for politics posts.  We can then discuss the potential conspiracies involved.  It is quite a big difference in discussion than you would find in most places which in and of itself warrants the admission of the post into the sub in my opinion.</p>

<p>I agree that we should not censor alternative view points.  They should be addressed, not censored.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes exactly! I don&#39;t even get why I was met with so many downvotes because I wasn&#39;t even stating anything controversial.</p>

<p>Or they might make this sub like the others where there are 10,000 rules and that creates a level of censorship itself.</p>

<p>They&#39;re already replacing mods. This sub cannot last forever.</p>

<p>Idk what we should just accept, but I do know like minds like ours will continue to do what we do regardless of the forum. All I&#39;m saying is don&#39;t worry too much. </p>
