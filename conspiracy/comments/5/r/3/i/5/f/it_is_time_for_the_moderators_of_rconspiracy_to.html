    <div class="md"><p>I am not worried about any of these guys banning me. I have been posting here for years.</p>

<p>The only reason for any possible choosing of sides by the mods is <em>because</em> this sub has been allowed to be a dumping ground for political posts and it has infected this subreddit.</p>

<p>There is a legit quandry on the part of the mods here in that <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> has a proud tradition and policy of no censorship. It is a policy that matters to everyone who has been in this sub for any length of time. However, people are taking advantage of this subreddit&#39;s no censorship policy to the point where this subreddit has been taken over by people who want to post about politics and no conspiracies. </p>

<p>Three comes a point where these moderators need to look themselves in the mirror and decide what matters to them. When they start putting their own politics ahead of what this sub is supposed to mean then they have lost their way.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>While I understand and sympathize with you, I have to disagree.</p>

<p>One, most conspiracy theories have a government-coverup element to them and therefore is subject to being politically charged. I understand you said &quot;purely political non-conspiracy postings&quot; but it would be so subjective to implement. </p>

<p>Two, censorship is a slippery slope and it could cause more chaos than benefits.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t have an answer other than just to wait it out, upvote/downvote as desired, and contribute to conspiracy-related discussions. The mods here have been amazing. I&#39;m 92.3% sure they are human and I&#39;m sure they are struggling with a solution as well.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Upvoting and downvoting does not work against an army of brigading shills on both sides of the political spectrum. Conspiracy posts are getting drowned off the front page.</p>

<p>I have sat in the new queue and vigilantly tried to downvote political advocacy posts and upvote conspiracy posts and self posts, but it does not matter anymore. When the regular people are outnumbered by <em>thousands</em> of people upvoting political posts then we can vote til we are blue  in the face and it will not matter.</p>

<p>I do not think that the mods coming down hard and strict for a week  or two so people can move on to where they normally post in their political echo chamber and out of here is a slippery slope problem that censorship normally would be. This is purely about cleansing an infection, nothing more.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>True true.</p>

<p>What if there was an interim strategy of asking the mods to call out to the long-time conspiracy lurkers here to be active in the voting and discussion? I was one of them until I saw what was happening.</p>

<p>Try that for a few days. If that doesn&#39;t work, then a hybrid approach between OP and <a href="/u/Git_Off_Me_Lawn">/u/Git_Off_Me_Lawn</a> to minimize low-effort posts.  A temporary rule that each post needs to specifically list out:</p>

<p>1) Conspirators</p>

<p>2) Supporting Evidence</p>

<p>3) Conspiracy Theory</p>

<p>A big fear I have is Mod fatigue. OPs suggestion is only for a week so we are asking them to do more work for a week. Not unreasonable. However, they will be subject to all kinds of crap in that week. And what if we need more than a week... and so on.  I can&#39;t speak for the mods but at some point it becomes not worth it.  CTR/AB/CA is getting paid to do this.  Mods aren&#39;t. </p>

<p>This is how Mod coups happen. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You made a lot of good points and provided a reasonable framework for your hybrid idea. Nothing wrong with your first idea to get the loyal users to be more active, but unfortunately I see regular posters being downvoted to hell - but it&#39;d still be a good start. We&#39;ve definitely gotta do something. I absolutely loathe the idea of censorship (even for a short, temporary time) in a sub that&#39;s free to discuss things such as the holocaust, something that people in western europe aren&#39;t even free to do, but free speech won&#39;t really matter once this sub looks like r/politics.</p>

<p>As far as your understandable worry about mod fatigue if we went w/your hybrid idea, is there any way some subscribers (vetted by regulars) could help them out? Especially since it would only be for a pretty short period of time. I would volunteer to mod, but I have zero idea how to do that and I&#39;m not sure I&#39;m eligible anyway. I would be happy to volunteer to help in any way that the mods would have me help, though, like unimportant busy work or something. I have a flexible work schedule and this sub has always felt like a lifeline to sanity in a false-flag/holographic kind of world, and I want it to stay that way. </p>

<p>This subreddit is hard to recognize right now, and the election being over has not brought the correction that people  thought it would. This place is more <a href="/r/politics_uncensored">/r/politics_uncensored</a> than it is <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>. But you are relatively new and do not have the same frame of reference as I and many of the mods have.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve been struggling with the dichotomy of freedom of speech vs. censorship for a while during my private sessions of lamentation of this sub.  It is a similar debate to that of individual freedom vs. security, transposed to the sun that argues about that relationship most. I most strongly voiced my concerns of censorship last week regarding a hive of voting account worker bees, essentially a down-voting behemoth capable of ranking posts to into an early grave. </p>

<p>I love this sub for the same reasons it frustrates me; anyone can say just about anything they like, and no argument is too ridiculous. </p>

<p>One thing I will reiterate from previous arguments is the appeal for mutual cooperation. I remember when this sub was capable of logical debate upon which a group consensus could be amicably achieved. Logging on to PMs of being called a shill (or worse) by people who&#39;s post histories are nothing but partisan jargon and doublespeak parroted ad infinitum is discouraging and serves only to embolden the user to post responses from a place of emotion as opposed to logic. </p>

<p>The brigades are here to create rifts; I would have thought we could all see through this and overcome it together, though instead we&#39;ve allowed these outsiders to ruin what was once a bastion of hope for those who felt things are not always as they seem. I feel if we relearn how to cooperate collectively, we could more easily identify those suspect accounts and simply ignore them into oblivion. </p>

<p>They do not deserve out time, efforts, nor our creativity.</p>

<p>This, so...so...<em>this</em>.</p>

<p>I am not against people posting something related to politics if it is clearly something conspiratorial in it&#39;s nature, or if the person posting makes a plausible effort to tie it into an overarching conspiracy of some kind. You know, come up with a <em>theory</em> of their own as to why their post belongs in this sub.</p>

<p>It is the posts that are advocating a political position of one kind or another, low-effort political newsfeed links, or one side of a political spectrum or viewpoint bashing the other side, political posts that are not about a conspiracy at all that need to be culled from the subreddit. It is those kinds of <strong>non-conspiracy political postings</strong> that I see flooding the subreddit and are drowning out the real conspiracy posts, the posts where someone puts in their time and effort to research were the posts that were the backbone of this subreddit. </p>

<p>When you can  look and see that there are 5,000+ active users in the sub (ffs today there were over 7,000 active users here at one point!) when normally we are closer to 1,000 active users, or closer to 2,000 on a <em>really</em> busy day then something is off. That many users who are normally never here are the ones re-defining this sub, they are the ones brigading all the non-conspiracy political to the front page every day and mucking up the sub.</p>

<p>If the low-effort non-conspiracy related political posts that really do not add value to the sub, and are not related to the primary conspiracy theme of this subreddit, are diligently removed for a short period of time then people will move on and stop posting and brigading this crap on to the front page.</p>

<p>After a time the strict interpretation and deletions can stop once the sub regains it&#39;s equilibrium. I am not advocating a permanent change to this sub&#39;s no-censorship tradition. I am advocating that the moderators do their job and stop people from taking advantage of the spirit of our no-censorship policy here so they can advocate a political position that has nothing to do with conspiracies at all. </p>

<p>It is not <strong>all</strong> political posts we are talking about here, it&#39;s the lazy political advocacy or information posts, or posts where one side of a political spectrum is attacking the other or disagreeing with a  position of the other side, posts that are just echoing boilerplate MSM talking points, or political posts that are not even tangentially relating to conspiracies or trying to make a case for a conspiracy, that we are talking about. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree.</p>

<p>However - there are conspiracies about politics and those should be allowed.</p>

<p>Also remember - there is a report button beneath each post.  This is anonymous reporting to the mods.  It will flag the post in the moderator queue and make it easy for the mods to find and remove.  You can also report threads that aren&#39;t conspiracies.</p>
