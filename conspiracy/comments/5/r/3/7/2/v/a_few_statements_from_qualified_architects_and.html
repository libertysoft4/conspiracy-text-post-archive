<blockquote>
<p>“I&#39;m a chemical engineer with bachelors and masters degrees in engineering from the University of Michigan. I&#39;m an authority on the flammability of materials and I have testified in court on this subject. WTC 7 was demolished with explosives attached to the structural frame. Hardly anything in the building was flammable; it was mostly steel, glass, and masonry.” — <strong>Bruce Caswell</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<hr/>

<blockquote>
<p>“My experience has included being president of three different architectural firms in Michigan and New England. My outrage and shock at being asked to believe the net of lies surrounding this event matches the feelings of the founding members of AE911Truth. As I watched the towers fall on television, I knew the rapid destruction on display made no scientific sense. Though the tentacles of this subject run in every direction, this betrayal of our national confidence and honor as citizens must not be allowed to stand.” — <strong>Paul R. Bilgen, AIA</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<hr/>

<blockquote>
<p>“I&#39;m a licensed architect familiar with structural steel design. When considering the yield point of A36 steel and the redundancy factors included in all 21st century buildings, these buildings could not have been collapsed by an airplane of any kind. This was obvious to me at the time I saw the collapse on television. When the first building came down I told my wife that ‘airplanes cannot make that happen.’&quot; — <strong>John C. Heflebower</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<hr/>

<blockquote>
<p>“I have 30 years of diverse design and on-site experience in the engineering field. My most relevant credentials are my extensive experience in computer simulation of structures and mechanical components. I recently reviewed much of the documentation that AE911Truth has supplied and also other sources. My conclusion, based on my engineering experience and intuition, is that structures that are struck in a random nature do not respond with the type of symmetry we see in the WTC towers collapse. In fact, if one were hypothetically tasked to collapse these towers as symmetrically as they fell, it would be nearly impossible, at least for someone without expertise in demolition or other advanced techniques.” — <strong>Attilio Colangelo</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<hr/>

<blockquote>
<p>“I have twenty-seven years experience as an engineer, the past eighteen of which have been as an independent consultant. During my career, I have developed a specialty in analyzing and addressing residential and commercial buildings with structural problems. It’s taken a long time for me to come to terms with the real possibility that the true causes of the WTC collapses on 9/11 were obscured from the general public and perhaps much worse. We must know the truth, because what’s left of our democracy depends on it.” — <strong>Richard Herschiag</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<hr/>

<blockquote>
<p>“I have worked in almost every city in NY. I have been licensed 24 years doing a variety of work from residential to industrial. I was on the phone with another architect on 9/11. We both noted the flashes on the floors below the collapsing floor when the towers came down. Two years later I was involved in demolishing six buildings in Kodak Park. I realized it was like watching 9/11 all over again. I have no doubt that WTC was controlled demolition. If the mast was not controlled it would have been a sideways fall killing 10,000 more.” — <strong>James Myers</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<hr/>

<blockquote>
<p>“I&#39;ve been involved in construction all my professional life. I&#39;ve seen controlled demolitions, and from the day of 9/11/01 watching the towers come down, I knew it had to be a controlled demolition. For the government to not even investigate this possibility in a serious way is beyond unbelievable.” — <strong>Thomas Kahler</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<hr/>

<blockquote>
<p>“I have fifteen years experience in defense and private industry engineering and project management. Recognizing that the Twin Towers and WTC 7 were instances of controlled demolition is not the hard part. The hard part is overcoming the emotional hurdle that our government betrayed us. I went into shock and had to grieve when I accepted this. As a country we need to face this anger and grief if we are to come to terms with ourselves and leave a legacy we can reconcile with.” — <strong>Ben Werner</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<hr/>

<blockquote>
<p>“I have a Bachelor of Architecture and a Master of Architectural (Structural) Engineering. I remember being very surprised by the collapse of the Twin Towers after the planes struck. Despite the damage and fires, it did not seem possible. I also remember reports of Building 7 being evacuated because it was expected to come down from sustained damage. I accepted the explanations given by the media. It wasn’t until years later that I started examining the research of experts on this and other websites and rethinking my discomfort with the official account. From an understanding of steel failure, I would expect any collapse to be gradual and asymmetric. If the official story were true, it would be a major embarrassment to the US design and construction industry that these towers failed so catastrophically, especially Building 7. I want to stand on the right side of history. We all deserve a real investigation with subpoena power, that explores every possibility.” — <strong>Forrest Mertz</strong></p>

    <div class="md"><p>The two undeniable contradictions is the WTC 7 fell for no apparent reason - it was not only not hit, but a building between it and 1 and 2 was undamaged, and that the pentagon was hit by a jumbo jet that nobody saw and that wasn&#39;t recorded on camera, said jet piloted through a near-impossible flight path by a pilot who could barely pilot a Cessna.</p>

<p>What about the people who were killed at the Pentagon? Just a coincidence? Nope. The Office of Naval Intelligence was targeted specifically due to their investigations into the  9/12/2001 theft of the Soviet Treasury. The two banking offices in each of the towers that held documents related to the investigation were conveniently hit by the two planes in NYC</p>

<ul>
<li><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5IgqJXyLbg&amp;amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;amp;t=14s">Tom Sullivan - Former Explosives Loader for Controlled Demolition, Inc. (CDI) discusses the complex process of preparing a building for controlled demolition and explains the reasons why WTC Building 7 was a textbook controlled demolition.</a></p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJy7lhVK2xE">WTC Chief Electrical Design Engineer, Richard Huemenn P.E., shares his unique perspective inside the elevator shafts of the twin towers and how access to the core columns could have been gained for demolition. &quot;An international commission should be formed to look at this in an unbiased manner.&quot;</a></p></li>
</ul>

<p>And these engineers:</p>

<p><strong>Steven Dusterwald, S.E. - Structural Engineer</strong>: <a href="https://youtu.be/I7oti6KGEf4">https://youtu.be/I7oti6KGEf4</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Mr. Dusterwald presents contradictory evidence between the NIST model and the actual sequence of failures within all the WTC Buildings.</p>

<p><strong>David Topete, MSCE, S.E., Structural Engineer</strong>: <a href="https://youtu.be/v9WB1A9j8f8">https://youtu.be/v9WB1A9j8f8</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Mr. Topete discusses how WTC Building 7&#39;s column 79&#39;s failure could not have caused the symmetrical and simultaneous collapse into it&#39;s own footprint.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Kamal Obeid, C.E., S.E. – Civil/Structural Engineer</strong>: <a href="https://youtu.be/3WCcSHpvAJ8">https://youtu.be/3WCcSHpvAJ8</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Mr. Obeid, a 30-year structural engineer explains how NIST&#39;s analysis actually disproves it&#39;s own theories on how WTC Building 7 collapsed, thereby confirming the use of controlled demolition.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Ron Brookman S.E., - Structural Engineer</strong>: <a href="https://youtu.be/TM_l_4sJ-sY">https://youtu.be/TM_l_4sJ-sY</a></p>

<p>Mr. Brookman discusses his direct inquiries with President Obama and NIST on NIST&#39;s responsibility to find the cause of the collapse of WTC Building 7 and their responses.</p>

<p>Wonder why they wouldn&#39;t just crash the planes and leave it at that? Why would they go a step further into a theatrical type display? </p>

<p>Maybe bc huge explosions are normalised in film, tv, etc that they didn&#39;t think &quot;just the planes&quot; would be enough (which is incredibly sad)... not sure why they would make it so obvious? To have less collateral damage (if it was to fall naturally / random more people who have been hurt)?</p>
