    <div class="md"><p>Here is my line of reasoning. Your post is to deflect from the pedo investigation by labeling it as goofy. This passive aggressive attempt to dissuade others from digging further into researching the subject lends more energy to the subject.</p>

<p>Instead of complaining start posting more evidence of what you are researching and have found because your post on the front page makes CT look like a bunch of fools actually. Which includes you.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There is zero probability that the Podesta brothers resort to first-hand kidnapping.  They can afford handlers to do that dirty work for them.  Not only that, but to link them to a high profile case such as Madeleine McCann with police sketches is laughable and desperate.  It doesn&#39;t make any sense.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not saying that pizza and Epstein is bogus.  I&#39;m saying Madeleine McCann has nothing to do with Podesta and there are more important things to be promoting.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>While I generally agree with you,  I feel it&#39;s transposing too much of what we sane rational people would do in these situations. Well the fact is most of these people are raging psychopath who are anything but rational. With that said, is it really that much more of a stretch to think that an individual who is obviously highly into pedophilia and goes to Great Lengths to surround themselves with it, would not get off in their own sick way and enjoy the thrill of doing the kidnappings themselves? Of course our first thought is they have entirely too much money and power to get their hands dirty themselves, but who knows that could be part of the thrill for them for all we know. Reason and rational have long been lost on these people... And to understand and figure them out, we have to put ourselves in their mind. Not put their mind in ours and run it through our world views. </p>

<p>I think that the above scenario is probably unlikely, but to write it off completely is irresponsible to your own research and Knowledge. </p>

Heck, one frequenter of that Comet pizza place has literal pictures of a penis shooting out pizza, among many other blatantly sexual things on their Instagram such as a picture of fully nude men with pizzas covering their crotches. I think the fact that they keep associating pizza with sexual things is proof enough that they&#39;re not merely talking about pizza. There <em>is</em> a code.</p>

<p>Also, what the heck with the logo of that Besta Pizza place having a logo that resembles a known pedophile symbol. And across the street there is another place that ALSO has a logo that is extremely similar to another pedophile symbol. <a href="http://i.imgur.com/NkIPXwq.png">Link</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>what boost though? the MSM didn&#39;t touch it, and it&#39;s not a crime so it&#39;s a dead end in terms of getting Clinton or her staff indicted. It makes people who talk about it look like crazies when they say &quot;Clinton linked to satanic rituals!&quot;. I don&#39;t know of anyone&#39;s mind who was changed on who to vote for because of that meme.</p>

<p>The only news making the MSM over the weekend was &quot;Clinton cleared in 2nd FBI investigation&quot;, which only helps her going into the vote. Of course, that in itself is obvious corruption as there&#39;s no way they went through 650k emails in a week, it feels like the fix is in. </p>

<p>I definitely agree on this. </p>

<p>And to be fair, I&#39;m not trying to claim any particular predictions or analyses over others as I believe it to be impossible to know truth from fiction with any degree of certainty at this point. But in terms of this boost I mentioned, I was referring to an overall impression I got from obsessively observing the_donald over the last few days, where #SpiritCooking was treated as the most effective &quot;red pill&quot;, particularly among minority voters. They also cited a few polls, I think primarily the LA Times one, which had a pronounced uptick for Trump after the Spirit Cooking revelations.</p>

<p>Again, I realise that subreddit alone is a very narrow viewpoint, and as a European I am not as immersed in the mainstream culture as US citizens would be, but I still maintain the impression that CTR was not by any means promoting this particular story.</p>
