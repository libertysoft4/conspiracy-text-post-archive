<p>Wrong fucking answer, man.  That’s the best you can do?  Try to come back with a statement like that?  How exactly is that changing the fact that neither you nor I nor anyone else - like I already said - is coming together and DOING SOMETHING against this shit system?</p>

<p>Does saying something like that somehow make your ego feel better?  Well, good.  Unfortunately, however, it doesn’t do shit to the fact that, as I said above, there are exactly ZERO “cannons getting charged”, as you said above.  My point is don’t say those things because we haven’t charged ANY cannons as a population yet.  You haven’t done so as an individual, and we haven’t done so as a citizenry.  So that’s just <em>very</em> empty talk.</p>

<p>And I don’t give a fuck <em>who’s</em> “laughing at the Anti-hilary [sic] community”.  The Clinton, the Trump, the Obama, the GOVERNMENT community is fucked and corrupt…and literally <em>everyone</em> can “laugh” at me if they want for saying that.  It’s still the truth.  Doesn’t matter how anyone reacts to it.</p>
