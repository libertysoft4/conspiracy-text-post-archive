It always surprises me when I see comments like &quot;Trumps our only hope, he&#39;s anti-establishment/anti-globalist&quot; - If that was actually the case he wouldn&#39;t have gotten as far as he has. If he does win, he&#39;ll be controlled by the same shadow government that controlled the previous president. Same goes for Shilldog.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Because absolute power corrupts absolutely. While this may be true to some degree, let&#39;s not forget Qaddafi and other leaders that decided to push back. Even if someone truly good came along, the CIA could implement a strategy learned from MKULTRA such as blow scopolamine in Mr. Dogood&#39;s face and have him unknowingly molest a 3 year old girl on video or God knows what. Anything that can be used to blackmail an individual will inevitably corrupt them or finish them. Not everything requires a coup or assassination. I&#39;m not suggesting fear should prevent us from doing what is correct and upright. I am suggesting that TPTB will gladly turn you into a martyr for your cause. No weapon cache necessary.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>How much ego do we need to sift through before we can all admit that none of us really knows?  All we can do is make the best assumptions we can based off the information that we are given, which is laughable. </p>

<p>So in light of all of that I&#39;ve said and I propose that we act on things that we do know.  Information is power and meme magic is real.  We are just beginning to learn what weapons we have and speculating on failing is a complete waste of time and is counterproductive in the ongoing battle of good and evil that we are all part of whether we want to be or not.  </p>

<p>Confirmation bias is real.  Power of positivity is real.  Self fulfilling prophecies are real.  </p>

<p>Let&#39;s be accountable and responsible with our thoughts and energy and apply them to the seemingly impossible task of taking down this endless evil that we keep further unraveling through new information that will always come. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Operating on the assumption all that you say is a given, the public discourse is very useful.  Regardless of how broken the system is, the key to fixing it is getting people to become aware.  That&#39;s the first step.  There are prerequisites for systemic change, and those include public discourse and public agreement.  This election, kabuki or not, has a provided a public platform that has had quite a lot of engagement.  I think that&#39;s a good thing.  This election cycle has been fruitful.</p>

<p>And regardless of whatever shit hits the fan, there will come a time after that in which people have to come to agreement.  This is always how that cycle works.  Public dialogue, particularly polite and intellectually honest public dialogue make the change process smoother.  I&#39;m not advocating behaviour here - I&#39;m just pointing out how the Machine of Human Agreement functions.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think it was better to applaud the wars, I was young, and I was saying the wars are bullshit, and I got a lot of shit for it.  During that time period, you were not allowed by society to go against the war.  They even started a &quot;You must not support the troops then&quot; type meme, in a sense, where everyone would spout it.  Now, those same people, are saying what I said back then, you can support the troops while not supporting the war..hypocrites IMO.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Please learn the definition of conspiracy theory. Then tell us how theory is a fact. Realize also that things like evolution even are still called theories, not facts. </p>

<p>You may very well understand what the difference is. And I may be out of line, but I feel our group needs to be stringent on our use of conspiracy theory, lest we help people who lump conspiracy theorist with whatever is something not to be trusted. </p>

<p>Tl;dr, don&#39;t wildly say a theory is a fact - especially if it&#39;s a theory of a conspiracy - without proper evidence. Even with evidence, it&#39;s gotta be innocent until proven guilty. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Words in the English language can have more than one meaning, such as theory. Feel free to investigate the differences between scientific theory, that has withstood the rigors of peer review and the scientific process, and the more common use of the word. It&#39;s also true that the English language evolves, this creating even more confusion to the uninformed. We all are guilty of assuming a single definition for a given word, so please don&#39;t misunderstand my tone. </p>

<p>The reason I stated it&#39;s fact, and not conspiracy theory is that TPTB wrote a book about the ongoing formation of the NWO! Every President since Bush Sr has talked about it as well as various leaders including Kissinger, HRC, and even &quot;civilians&quot; like Bill Gates. It&#39;s not just US leaders saying this, but earth movers the world over. They aren&#39;t even hiding any more. Therefore, I can empirically call the movement towards a one world government a fact.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This argument always falls flat in its face when you actually get involved in leadership at the local or state level. </p>

<p>It&#39;s people trying their best to obtain power through the will of the people or through deals with those all ready in power. However, neither is a sure bet on a victory because voting matters at these levels.</p>

<p>How else do certain states vote for specific health care legislature or marijuana legalization? It&#39;s through voting. </p>

<p>Perhaps at the federal level, the machines are rigged and the deals with people all ready in power are much more crucial. I&#39;ll generously give you that. </p>

<p>But the notion that we don&#39;t choose any of our leaders is incredibly misleading and outright false.</p>
