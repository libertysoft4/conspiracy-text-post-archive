<p>Definitions of Terrorism in U.S. Code 
18 U.S.C. § 2331 defines &quot;international terrorism&quot; and &quot;domestic terrorism&quot; for purposes of Chapter 113B of the U.S. Code, entitled &quot;Terrorism.”</p>

<p>&quot;International terrorism&quot; means activities with the following three characteristics:</p>

<p>Involve violent acts or acts dangerous to human life that violate federal or state law;
Appear to be intended<br/>
(i) to intimidate or coerce a civilian population;<br/>
(ii) to influence the policy of a government by intimidation or coercion; or<br/>
(iii) to affect the conduct of a government by mass destruction, assassination, or kidnapping; and
Occur primarily outside the territorial jurisdiction of the U.S., or transcend national boundaries in terms of the means by which they are accomplished, the persons they appear intended to intimidate or coerce, or the locale in which their perpetrators operate or seek asylum.*      </p>

<p>At the same time we should return to plans to provide the FSA, or some group of moderate forces, with equipment that will allow them to deal with a weakened ISIL, and stepped up operations against the Syrian regime. This entire effort should be done with a low profile, avoiding the massive traditional military operations that are at best temporary solutions. While this military/para-military operation is moving forward, <strong>we need to use our diplomatic and more traditional intelligence assets to bring pressure on the governments of Qatar and Saudi Arabia, which are providing clandestine financial and logistic support to ISIL and other radical Sunni groups in the region.</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is hard evidence that the US destabilized Africa in order to get Clinton elected. This is how Secretary Clinton empowered ISIS. Assange outlines how Clinton committed Treason, not <em>merely</em> Pay-to-Play: </p>

<p><a href="https://youtu.be/_sbT3_9dJY4?t=4m16s">Now pay attention because it is far more subtle and not nearly as inflammatory as American audiences would like.</a> (Dartmouth Films). Clinton knew that Saudi Arabia and Qatar were arming ISIS while Secretary of State and they still gave weapons to Saudi Arabia and Qatar though we knew them to fit the FBI&#39;s definition of Terrorism (This is what FBIAnon was talking about). This is &quot;giving aid and comfort&quot; to an enemy of the state, <em>by using the state department</em>.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.heritage.org/constitution/#!/articles/3/essays/119/treason">Heritage.org sites the US Constitution defining Treason</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Treason against the United States, shall consist only in levying War against them, or in <strong>adhering to their Enemies, giving them Aid and Comfort.</strong> No Person shall be convicted of Treason unless on the Testimony of two Witnesses to the same overt Act, or on Confession in open Court.</p>

<p>CNN reported that <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2015/12/08/politics/amnesty-international-isis-weapons-u-s-/index.html">ISIS was armed with American Weapons</a> in December, 2015 just a few months after <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/jun/03/us-isis-syria-iraq">The Guardian reported</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>a recently declassified <a href="http://www.judicialwatch.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Pg.-291-Pgs.-287-293-JW-v-DOD-and-State-14-812-DOD-Release-2015-04-10-final-version11.pdf">secret US intelligence report</a>, written in August 2012, which uncannily predicts – and effectively welcomes – the prospect of a “Salafist principality” in eastern Syria and an al-Qaida-controlled Islamic state in Syria and Iraq. In stark contrast to western claims at the time, the Defense Intelligence Agency document identifies al-Qaida in Iraq (which became Isis) and fellow Salafists as the “major forces driving the insurgency in Syria” – and states that “western countries, the Gulf states and Turkey” were supporting the opposition’s efforts to take control of eastern Syria.</p>

<p>If you are a liberal ask yourself how you feel about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran%E2%80%93Contra_affair">Iran/Contra</a> and if you want to be the one defending it for <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/oct/31/refugees-problem-europe-identity-crisis-migration">the next 50 years</a> (The Gaurdian) because this mass migration taking place in Europe is the <a href="http://www.npr.org/2015/12/27/461173027/reflecting-on-a-year-of-europe-s-migrant-crisis">biggest thing to happen there since WW2</a> (NPR)</p>

<p>This has had significant effect on international relationships too that threaten <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pax_Europaea">the longest peace in western Europe</a> since Augustus Caeser.

<p>The US created the Refugee Crisis in Europe and is why <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/opinion/2016/07/turexit-turkey-leave-nato-160721105010182.html">Turkey may leave NATO</a>; This is why <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2014/09/04/world/europe/uk-nato-summit/index.html">Russia</a> may invade the rest of Ukraine.

<p>In short, Assange did not over-hype <a href="https://www.rt.com/news/319797-syria-depopulation-refugees-assange/">the ramifications of US involvement in Syria.</a></p>

<hr/>

<p>South Korea is forcing President Park Geun-hye to flee for her life for similar accusations <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/us-southkorea-politics-idUSKCN12T08V"><em>right now</em></a> (Rueters) (and another from <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2016/11/05/asia/south-korea-president-protests/index.html">CNN</a>). Can we at least get a march going?</p>

<hr/>

<p>Its worth noting that nothing in the Assange video suggests Assange is safe in the Embassy. Watch it again and you may see the edit where you dont see Pilger ask the question about the FBI investigation and Assange only makes a statement about the purpose of the FBI. Also Pilger makes a statement about the last week of the campaign and Assange never addresses that statement. There is no establishing shot. Do you remember the Daily Show interviews and how they were cut? The only dates tied to the video are <a href="https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/7243">10/13 referencing the Saudi Arabia funding</a>, Assanges internet <a href="http://www.politico.com/story/2016/10/julian-assange-internet-connection-cut-229875">being cutoff</a>, and the Moroccan King email released <a href="https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/22030">10/20</a>. Those dates are important because it is speculated that Assange was taken from the embassy on the 20th/21st of October. The only place the discussion is even <em>allowed</em> to happen is at <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>. For more information see <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/5ai563/reasons_to_believe_julian_assange_is_in_cia/">here</a>.

<p>That thread is time stamped &quot;21 days ago.&quot; That would place it on the 17th. I was following the flight at the time - you can see my comments in that thread. So, yes I can confirm that flight GLF5 was on 10/17/16 insofar as I watched it live on that day on Flightradar24.com.</p>

<p>This thread, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/595o8y/where_is_julian_assange/">Where is Julian Assange</a>, from two weeks ago also mixed up the flight&#39;s date, placing it on the same day you did, the 21st.

FBI ANON ON DYN DNS DDOS ATTAC(...)10/21/16(Fri)22:22:47 No.94069254</p>

<p>I have to use a canadian proxy as my end point because though some of this is marked U//FOFU, others not. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>background
There has a been quite a bit of talk today about the attacks on our cyber infrastructure. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>technical details:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>DNS are like phonebooks, they take a url and give you an ip. your computer then connects to the ip.
DNS servers, for big sites, provide not just the ip address, but distributes the traffic amongst many ip-addresses and has added features where if one of the ip-addresses goes down, the DNS server will point you to another one.
the time to live (TTL; that&#39;s how long the saved phonebook-to-ip is considered valid) for these sites is 5 minutes because they want to provide you a fresh lookup in case the previous ip goes down or if too much traffic goes to it.
to break DNS, the attackers need to persist attacks longer than this time to live. 
Normally for your basic website, like 4chan that lives at one data center, the TTL can be in hours or days.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>note: this last bit is a bit complicated, so read it over a few times
reliability for DNS is achieved by having valid records distributed and saved across many DNS servers. This isn&#39;t possible if the TTL is really short. Only big sites with multiple data centers are vulnerable to this attack because they need short TTL. 
today&#39;s attack is likely just a test run for a larger more sustained attack. 
the attack emerged from a distributed botnet of IP devices (IP cameras, the fridge, TV box tops)</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p>habbening:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>nov 8
critical internet infrastructure will brought to its knees in order cut people off from news/information about the elections results
sites that are vulnerable to this sort of TTL attack will be down, these are sites that require multiple data centers to distribute traffic (CNN, NBC, FOX, face book, reddit, twitter, youtube).
this would create an information vacuum around the election results
would you riot?</p>

<p><strong>The Assange Factor</strong></p>

<p>Assange wants to <a href="http://www.anonews.co/assange-on-hillary/">bring down Hillary</a> because he knows she won&#39;t pardon him or his friend Chelsea Manning, but he is also <a href="http://www.democracynow.org/2016/7/25/julian_assange_choosing_between_trump_or">not a Trump supporter</a>. COG (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuity_of_government">continuity of government</a>) wants to get Hillary or Trump elected, who would most likely renew COG <a href="http://rense.com/general92/coup.htm">like Obama has done the past several times</a>. They definitely don&#39;t want Bernie Sanders or Jill Stein, who would promptly throw their asses in the shitcan. Why do you think Bernie was stomped out like a used cigarette butt?</p>

<p>Now that Hillary is basically <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/casar-vargas/why-i-can-no-longer-suppo_1_b_12698874.html">done for</a> and Assange&#39;s main goal of exposing her treason for all Americans to see is complete, they took him out of the picture, so what do we have left? COG Plan B, the <a href="http://www.zerohedge.com/news/2016-10-21/assange-tweets-chilling-assessment-us-democracy-there-no-us-election-there-power-con">Pied Piper candidate</a> aka Donald Trump on the express lane to becoming POTUS, not much dirt in his way. Meanwhile Assange is unable to say or do anything about it.</p>

<p>I believe THIS is why John Kerry (<a href="https://www.intellihub.com/state-department-h-q-houses-secretive-shadow-governments-7th-floor-group/">7th Floor Group aka shadow government</a> aka COG) forced Ecuador to cut off Assange&#39;s internet. COG was worried that Assange would interfere <em>even further</em> with the election and push people away from Donald Trump as well. Assange was <a href="http://thehill.com/blogs/ballot-box/presidential-races/291763-assange-wikileaks-very-happy-to-get-trump-info">itching to get his hands on Trump leaks</a>? Where&#39;d that effort go? The crickets are starting worry.</p>

<p>If both Hillary and Trump were pushed out, COG would either get put on the backburner or dissolved, but COG had contingency Plan B in the works - <em><a href="http://heavy.com/news/2016/10/julian-assange-ecuador-internet-cut-john-kerry-hillary-clinton-statement-wikileaks-john-podesta-election-hack/">silence Assange</a> and <a href="http://www.redstate.com/brandon_morse/2016/10/08/leaked-emails-show-trump-tool-used-hillary-campaign-day-one/">elevate Trump</a></em>. It was even DNC&#39;s inner plan to elevate Trump. Think about it...Assange would have <a href="http://www.democracynow.org/2016/8/8/wikileaks_julian_assange_attacks_against_jill">pushed third party</a> if he had the chance, or possibly Bernie if he wasn&#39;t cheated out of the DNC.</p>

<p><strong><em>Conclusion - if Assange isn&#39;t allowed to interfere with the election, to the point where his internet is cut off at the Embassy, then why is he subsequently allowed to make a &quot;live&quot; teleconference call to CISL to discuss the election, and why is he allowed to do an interview with John Pilger and discuss the election just days before Nov 8th? AND why wouldn&#39;t Sweden let him make a public appearance at Gavin MacFayden&#39;s funeral for an hour, where he WOULDN&#39;T be discussing the election?</em></strong></p>

<p>And if he/they cut the video in a fashion we are fooled to believe that... it means that THEY WANT EXACTLY THIS! They want the world wonder about Assange whereabouts. I TRUST PILGER!</p>

<p>And if they (our friend Pilger and RT and their friends) want to keep low profile around Assange whereabouts... it means Assange is safe, and maybe he&#39;s FLED from the embassy with some foreign help. We will be told after the election.</p>

<p>This is not a stupid dream. This is true if you trust Pilger.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>4chan&#39;s AMAs aren&#39;t high on my radar of credibility at the moment, especially as it relates to the FBI. </p>

<p>Maybe I&#39;m unfairly grouping credible FBIanon with what happened in the subsequent days, but for the next <em>week</em> there was a rash of LARPers who whipped the community into a lather that arrests were <em>just around the corner</em> and there was <em>big news tomorrow</em>, that the <em>NYPD was going to come forward and release EVERYTHING if Comey didn&#39;t indict.</em> People fell for it. Including me, which is my own damn fault because I wanted to believe.</p>

<p>Nothing happened (as defined by no arrests and Comey clearing Clinton a second time with zero ramifications). Even now, I&#39;m guessing 4Chan&#39;ers have their tail tucked between their legs in that there haven&#39;t been subsequent LARPs of explaining the FBI or NYPD &quot;behind the scenes&quot; right now.</p>

<p>Nothing <em>also</em> happened on Nov 5th as it relates to a big data dump or hack of some kind.</p>

<p>And now, we&#39;re still trying to push the narrative that Assange is dead and WL has been compromised, in spite of the Pilger interview? I&#39;m not buying it. </p>

<p>The mainstream media is guilty of giving people half the picture, where people then have to go out and get the rest of the story. But 4Chan is guilty of giving the full picture with a steaming heap of bullshit on top of it, where people then have to use critical thinking (or in some cases, wait for time to pass) to discern the actual truth. </p>

<p>TL;DR: Maybe FBIAnon is legit; maybe they&#39;re not.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Nothing happens for justice at the level we are talking about without political will. Without marching and demanding answers we all know we need, nothing can happen. Nothing. We have in our hands actionable evidence. But the the people running this country do not have to act until we make them. Look at the Civil Rights Act of 1964 for evidence of that fact. The ball is in our Court and TPTB will never address our concerns if we ourselves will not. </p>

<p>FBIanon has &quot;published&quot; crazy alien UFO stuff, in my opinion, on a website where people will actually read the info if it is confirming any outrageous notion they already believe. /conspiracy and /pol/ are the places where people actively challenge the &quot;official&quot; narrative,  we are the ones that would actually find this information and spread the word. When the wikileaks subreddit is actively suppressing &quot;their&quot;  own leaks, we have reason enough to question their legitimacy just as much as to question FBIanon. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>We are also the ones most easily silenced, ignored, and removed. The term &quot;conspiracy&quot; has very negative connotations in mainstream society. It is considered unacceptable for a person to entertain ideas that contradict the official narrative. This has given birth to places like /pol/ and <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>. </p>

<p>Since there is no place in our ever so sophisticated society for such discussions, we are forced into the fringes to discuss our ideas and have honest conversations. This further alienates us from &quot;normal&quot; people and also lumps us all together in a neat little package they label as &quot;crazy&quot;. </p>

<p>The point I&#39;m trying to make is that we collectively have very little influence on the situation. People dismiss us as loony tin foil hat clad conspiracy theorists. We have to think outside of the box to figure out some way to red pill enough people to get anything of substance done. If we fail to do this first, win the hearts and minds of the general populace, whatever action we take will be in vain.</p>

<p>Just my 2¢.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This email isn&#39;t even negative for Clinton. </p>

<p>It shows that the US is working to contain ISIL throughout the area. </p>

<p>It does show the US knows Saudi and Qatar fund and supply ISIL, but US is engaging them to contain the radical threat. The implication that any assistance to the Saudis or Qatar is treason to the US is laughable as they are our allies. You may not like that, but they are. We have a complex relationship with them and don&#39;t agree with 100% of everything they do. It&#39;s clear here that the US wants to pressure them to cut off ISIL.</p>

<p>Against Turkey it&#39;s interesting, because they want to full on arm the Kurds now because the Turkish gov&#39;t is now Islamist and seen as not an ally to the US.</p>

<p>Nothing here is out of line official gov&#39;t policy. </p>

<p>Reminds me of Assange and Trump&#39;s strange claims that Obama and Clinton created ISIS, ignoring the complicated nature/history of all the infighting and proxy wars. It&#39;s like smears against Hillary for connections to the Saudis because of 9/11 or here ISIS, while ignoring they are one of our very closest allies (and yes, sometimes they take actions we don&#39;t agree with, and yes, not all in the royal family are allies).</p>

<p>It sounds like a terrible accusation but only if you don&#39;t understand any of the context--and being cynical, it&#39;s obvious Assange knows most people lack that context but doesn&#39;t mind confusing people to push his advantage.</p>

<p>Continuing to distribute weapons to SA knowing they are arming ISIS. </p>

<p>I dont think you read the rest of the post.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>not all in the royal family are allies</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Doesnt matter. Email sites the government of Qatar and SA. Links from the Guardian above show that ISIS was Al-Qaeda. We knew that the Saudis were arming Al-Qaeda and used them to overthrow Assad. Kind of like Saddam or Bin Laden or the CONTRA&#39;s.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Assange knows most people lack that context but doesn&#39;t mind confusing people to push his advantage.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I dont think what Assange is asserting is intended for anyone that <em>isnt</em> paying attention. He isnt a sensationalist. And what he is talking about takes a ton of context. Which is why you have a wall of text above to explain it, which in itself requires 34(!) different links to give proper context. This is not for the low information consumer. But your half hearted rebuttal is.</p>
