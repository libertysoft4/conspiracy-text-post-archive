    <div class="md"><p>He is in line with the Zionist agenda, his AIPAC speech shows he is fully compliant. Thus he will go to war in Syria. From his AIPAC speech:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>My number-one priority is to dismantle the disastrous deal with Iran. ... </p>

<p>The biggest concern with the deal is not necessarily that Iran is going to violate it because already, you know, as you know, it has, the bigger problem is that they can keep the terms and still get the bomb by simply running out the clock. ... </p>

<p>When I’m president, I will adopt a strategy that focuses on three things when it comes to Iran. First, we will stand up to Iran’s aggressive push to destabilize and dominate the region. ... </p>

<p>Iran is a problem in Iraq, a problem in Syria, a problem in Lebanon, a problem in Yemen and will be a very, very major problem for Saudi Arabia. ... </p>

<p>When I’m president, believe me, I will veto any attempt by the U.N. to impose its will on the Jewish state. It will be vetoed 100 percent. ... </p>

<p>When I become president, the days of treating Israel like a second-class citizen will end on day one. ... </p>

<p>We will move the American embassy to the eternal capital of the Jewish people, Jerusalem. ... </p>

<p>The Palestinians must come to the table knowing that the bond between the United States and Israel is absolutely, totally unbreakable. </p>

<p>He&#39;s a total Zionist sellout, and a warmonger, and WILL attack Syria if it is massively profitable for him. Which is easy to do since the Rothschilds Zionists possess legal money-creation abilities through the central banks. </p>

<p>I wouldn&#39;t say this is a foregone conclusion, personally. But I do think America is being set up as the fall-guy for WW3 similarly to how Germany was for WW2. Very few countries in the world really like the US right now, it seems like. And our government has done plenty to piss off tons of people around the world, in an effort to control more, which is often driven by a need to repay central bank debts. So the Rothschild Zionists drive us to war in the end, to overthrow the countries they want. If only 7 billion people realized this, it would end overnight</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The idea it all hinges on people understanding it gives me hope, it&#39;s not like we have to distribute 7 billion computers or anything, it&#39;s just an idea that has to spread an take root, then our enemy will be defeated, I find that encouraging. But it is a dire situation, and we are just individuals caught in a storm much bigger than ourselves. But maybe we wake up 1000 people in our lifetimes, and they each wake up 100... It&#39;s one of those things that goes exponential very quickly now that the cat is out of the bag. </p>

<p>When I’m president, I will adopt a strategy that focuses on three things when it comes to Iran. First, we will stand up to Iran’s aggressive push to destabilize and dominate the region. ... </p>

<p>Iran is a problem in Iraq, a problem in Syria, a problem in Lebanon, a problem in Yemen and will be a very, very major problem for Saudi Arabia. ... </p>

<p>When I’m president, believe me, I will veto any attempt by the U.N. to impose its will on the Jewish state. It will be vetoed 100 percent. ... </p>

<p>When I become president, the days of treating Israel like a second-class citizen will end on day one. ... </p>

<p>We will move the American embassy to the eternal capital of the Jewish people, Jerusalem. ... </p>

<p>This are AIPAC Trump speech quotes. He&#39;s going to go to war with Syria and Iran, because Israel wants him to. He is a warmonger. He is absolutely not against foreign intervention, at all. </p>
