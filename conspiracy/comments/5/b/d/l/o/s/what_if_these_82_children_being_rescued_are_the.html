        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Think about it. And then the FBI can have a much clearer conscience if that&#39;s what they&#39;re sitting on.... Infact a child pedophile ring, then the FBI agents would feel better getting the kids rescued, and then probably later quietly silenced for standing up to Hillary and the billionaires... And then There would be no more evidence tying to The  Clintons and they would be allowed to go on as normal
As threatened by her administration or the elites ... I wonder. </p>

What makes it more shady is these rescues happened 3 weeks ago but news doesnt break until today, almost like they were giving certain people time to distance themselves and cover their trail.</p>

<p>How does that work? - They cured the country of pedophilia everyone! Whoopee!!</p>

<p>No, they saved a couple lives and the satanic, child-sacrificing pedophilia ring will continue unabated.  </p>

<p>There is no justification for this (if your theory is correct).  Do not accept this cop-out narrative.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>ok, so this is the tenth year of operation cross country, so that should mean that this was going to happen regardless of leaked emails. </p>

<p>Operation Cross Country X Press Conference</p>

<p><a href="https://youtu.be/Ree8cK-pr7M">https://youtu.be/Ree8cK-pr7M</a></p>

<p>quite frankly, 82 seems like a drop in the bucket compared to the thousands of reports they claim to get. </p>

<p>i can see not publishing the names of the kids who were allegedly rescued, but there should be a public record of the names of those who were arrested. if we can&#39;t find a list of names, then we can safely assume that the FBI is full of shit, and that they didn&#39;t rescue any kids. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think he is saying that the kids rescued are involved in the Clinton and Epstein conspiracy. The FBI agents care more about saving the kids from the torture they&#39;re enduring than they do prosecuting the Clintons. On the condition that the Clintons walk free, the FBI is given the information to rescue these kids from the Clintons and Epstein. </p>

<p>Not saying I concur with the argument but it could make sense if I&#39;m understanding it correctly. </p>
