    <div class="md"><p>Guys...c&#39;mon. People gathering for an historic moment in sports like &quot;the cubs winning the world series&quot; should not discredit the corruption going on within our government. Maybe something like this great achievement in a city where homicide is part of daily life isn&#39;t exactly such a bad thing. Did anyone riot? No. Did anyone burn down half the city? No. People actually celebrated hand in hand and embraced something positive in their lives and city. Just because some of you have no interest in sports doesn&#39;t mean you need to bash the people who are interested in team building, strategic, physical activity. I follow a few sports teams closely and celebrate hard when my team manages to bring home the gold...but that doesn&#39;t mean I&#39;m not following whats going on in our country and trying to find ways to make a difference. If ya&#39;ll are fat and horny and haven&#39;t been laid...ever....thats cool, man. Im still here for you.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;d suggest you read-up a little bit on the history of present day China before you start slagging away and dumping on them for a mere five million of them gathering together to celebrate what is to them simply one of their favorite baseball teams, especially out of a population that is four times greater than that of the US where 3 million people set the first record for the same thing when they lined the streets of Boston to celebrate the Red Sox winning the World Series in 2004.</p>

<p>What&#39;s the real problem here friend? That the Chinese have and like their baseball and baseball teams almost as much as Americans do?</p>

<p>Now you can rail all you like about so-called &quot;life and death&quot; issues or human rights violations all you like but I&#39;d like you to consider what life would be like in the US if it had four times it&#39;s present day population... and four times the number of homeless or unemployed or four times the number of criminals running around or locked-up behind bars and then compare those projections to China&#39;s current stats that are already well below those of US, right now, today, on all of those counts.</p>

<p>And let&#39;s get real here about human rights getting violated as if the same and worse doesn&#39;t happen in the US, not at the hands of the US government or some far stricter legal system, but to everyday Americans at the hands of their very own fellow citizens!</p>

<p>I&#39;d say the public cowardice and apathy that lets that kind of shit happen, or worse, sees it as some kind of an expression of all the freedom and rights they presumably have and enjoy is a far more obscene and reprehensible sight to behold than anything that ever goes down in China these days.</p>
