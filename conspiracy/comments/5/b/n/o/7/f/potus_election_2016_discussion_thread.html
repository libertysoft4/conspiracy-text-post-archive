    <div class="md"><p>Well, some forms of rigging I think are well proven at this point: namely, the elite pour money, use their companies (Esp media ones) as proxies for the candidate, they sometimes fund both sides to ensure they can use both to further their objectives, etc. </p>

<p>But I also think they rig the voting machines themselves. So much so, that it doesn&#39;t matter if a person steps into the booth or not. </p>

<p>While I think there&#39;s some evidence pointing to this in the 2000 election and in the Sanders/Clinton primaries... this is the theory that hasn&#39;t been proven with overwhelming evidence. </p>

<p>They use decimals so like that movie Office Space they can shave just like you said. In a close race its all they need to tip it.  And very hard for anyone to notice it where as a huge deviation might spur outrage.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>All presidents are only symbols, bar-coded Tarot-card chessmen in the Conspiracy&#39;s ceremonial Monopoly Gameboard Earth. Elections don&#39;t need to be fixed; they are FIXES for the hopeless who are all too willing to deceive themselves into getting a sense of &quot;empowerment&quot; by standing in line for hours to put a little checkmark on a dead piece of the Amazonian Rainforest. Some reptile shoves a card in front of your face: &quot;Which vampire would you like to pay to suck your blood? Clone One, Clone One, or Clone One?&quot; And you Pink Boys and Girls lecture about apathy! I repeat: They see us as MEAT - nobody gives a flightless FUCK what you think - and all those trees did die for nothing. Yes, you are free - free to be a consumption-gratified meat sack, sleepwalking malls coast to coast, reflexively seeking out the hide wrapped around another mobile hamburger.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Consistent polling across the board is a much, much better indicator of who&#39;s winning than rallies. Any statistics course could show you why this is true (falsely polling in support of her would do nothing to help her btw, and would probably hurt her). </p>

<p>Showing the fervor of his supporters doesn&#39;t tell you anything about the opposition. Most of the democratic base isn&#39;t that excited about Hillary Clinton, it&#39;s just agreed upon that she&#39;s a much, much better choice than the alternative. A few thousand passionate supporters doesn&#39;t tell you much about the hundreds of thousands voting in each state. </p>

<p>For the rest of the population of America to start legitimately rioting there literally has to be no gas at the pumps, no milk or bread in the stores.  This isn&#39;t a speculation, it&#39;s historical fact. </p>

<p>When over worked people complain. And maybe unionize</p>

<p>When out of fuel (gas) people protest</p>

<p>When out of food, people riot </p>

<p>Then depending if the state oppresses they revolt</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I mean, Russia &amp; the US definitely have been butting heads in the middle east. And US and China have been on edge, too. I don&#39;t think that the US is the &quot;good guy&quot; by any means... The US is absolutely responsible for the unrest in the middle east. And we&#39;ve only been provoking Russia further. I don&#39;t know whether or not Russia would actually seek to attack on US grounds. It&#39;s possible. But it&#39;s just as likely that the US would stage an attack to gain support to go to war. Seeing that they&#39;ve done it successfully once before...</p>

<p>Poor Poland wanted their independence back and Russia stole it with Prussia, then they welcomed Napoleon and all his empty promises only to starve and freeze to death in retreat of his massive over reach into Russia. (I will never understand Hitler copying his mistake except people say he had been getting more and more erratic and irrational).  Then WWI and Nazi&#39;s.

<p>Now we have these rumblings and it felt like HRC was pushing for WWIII.  She certainly wanted Lybia destabilized thus destroying the only dam keeping the Muslim hoards out of Europe.</p>

<p>Now I can onky pray Trump surprises us all in a good way and puts rhr breaks on this runaway train, encourages Syria not to cave to banking cabal and makes trade not war with the world but without disgusting liberty destroying treaties like TPP. </p>

<p>Russia isn&#39;t out there trying to dominate the world, spread communism, and burn babies, for Christ&#39;s sake... They&#39;re just trying to make sure they don&#39;t get bent over by Americans overreaching across the globe. They don&#39;t necessarily have the most progressive human right stances, but they&#39;re far from being the worst place out there, and a good case can be made about the US having a pretty fucking shady track record as well.

    <div class="md"><p>I believe they can. Many are veterans and enthusiasts that are trained to use their weapons. If it was possible to stomp out such a movement we would have won in Nam and I feel like our soldiers are unlikely to drop napalm on small town Georgia.</p>

<p>As for the ban.</p>

<p>Guns are like Pandora&#39;s box. They are out in the country and will not be removed. Few gun owners would turn their property to the govt and attempts to confiscate would turn groups like the NRA into a militia.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What makes a crazy homeless person with no ambition off the street any different from a man with ambition and a pension for profit under current laws?</p>

<p>I really don&#39;t understand your logic. Who is an ideal candidate for president? A crazy, feeble, criminal woman pandering to feminists? A black savior with a thirst for war and death overseas?</p>

<p>To be fair, there is no one qualified to lead a large nation. Why should anyone be above others?</p>

<p>The fact is, you&#39;re choosing between a profiteering businessman operating under corrupt law who can&#39;t run a casino and a profiteering businesswoman who takes bribes, harasses people with federal agencies, and is a proponent for war using banks, women and minorities as a platform and supports policy against her platform. They are both fallible.</p>

<p>The difference is that Hillary is a career politician and has things in the works to further her and her sponsors agenda and has done things beyond Trump&#39;s league. She is also a proven failure in politics from all areas of her career.</p>

<p>So why would anyone vote for her unless they are brainwashed? She&#39;s being sensationalized as a feminist hero although she condones and defends rape and sexual assault of women and sexual affairs by her husband. She&#39;s being painted as a hero to minorities although her past policies all indicate she is a racist an doesn&#39;t care.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t get the Trump hate.</p>

<p>Why didn&#39;t the false flag event happen? </p>

<p>Well by &quot;shortly after the election&quot; I didn&#39;t mean 2 hours.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Why didn&#39;t Hillary win? </p>

<p>I suspect Hillary didn&#39;t &#39;win&#39; because Trump actually won by a larger margin than they could flip via rigged voting machines, fraudulent ballots, etc. without making it obvious.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Because they&#39;re not just used to win elections, they&#39;re also used to change laws, gain power, instill fear, and advance political and military agendas in other ways. Take a look: <a href="http://www.washingtonsblog.com/2015/02/x-admitted-false-flag-attacks.html">http://www.washingtonsblog.com/2015/02/x-admitted-false-flag-attacks.html</a> . Unfortunately it&#39;s not a matter of if it will happen, but a matter of when it will happen again, and of how large of a crisis they want to create. </p>

<p>Obviously I hope it doesn&#39;t happen under the next President. As you said, I was just being smug with my predictions. And I hope the chance of it happening is diminished with Trump, but realistically we don&#39;t know much about him. </p>

<p>And potentially get Trump assassinated. Trump wants peace. The Oligarch&#39;s want war. John F. Kennedy wanted peace. The Oligarch&#39;s from JFK&#39;s time wanted war. JFK was shot. The parallel is clear.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I could be off the mark, but I don&#39;t understand why Bernie is still involved in campaigning for Hillary. He&#39;s fundamentally against what she&#39;s about. Given that either he was threatened or at risk of senate seat removal, all he had to do was endorse her at the DNC and then peace the hell out. Why the further involvement? By my logic, it seems to increase the chances of him being a shill by a pretty big margin. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>She has blackmail against him. I posted a way long thread outlining my theory about Sanders/Clinton <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/5bsq3c/conspiracy_theory_on_bernie_sanders/">here</a>. Remember the Wikileaks where they said how he wasn&#39;t &quot;sticking to the agreement&quot; and how they could use &quot;leverage&quot; if need be?</p>

<p>I&#39;m pretty sure the terms were laid out clearly when he decided to run: Clinton/DNC thought he could be useful as a way to reach the Occupy/youth crowd so they indulged his run. But I&#39;m guessing Clinton said something like, &quot;but if I win the nom (knowing full well she would), you agree to endorse me and continue to campaign. If  I win the presidency I&#39;ll offer you &#39;x-token.&#39; If you don&#39;t do these things, then x info gets released.&quot; Plus, she&#39;d be the POTUS. You don&#39;t want to be a politician on the wrong side of her, especially as a Dem. Even if he&#39;s technically an independent, it&#39;d be like pissing off the popular girl in school who can make your life in school a living hell.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not talking about the sexual assault allegations. Those were too well-timed to be taken seriously. They&#39;re entirely believable, but they serve the Clinton campaign a bit too well to be taken as fact. I&#39;m talking about the multiple recordings of him saying shit that clearly exposes Trump&#39;s views on women (ie: grabbing women by the pussy, attributing any sort of behavior he doesn&#39;t like to PMSing, commenting about women&#39;s weight in the most demeaning way he can muster, etc.)</p>

<p>The guy is a sexist mother fucker who doesn&#39;t seem to believe women have any use other than looking god and cooking his dinner. It&#39;s not a reason to not support him when the only other option is Clinton, but anyone who argues that Trump considers women to be equal to men has their head pretty damn deep up their own ass.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>See I find this attitude disturbing.  They&#39;ve built up this narrative around trump with nothing to back it up other than meaningless words.  The right has built it up like trump is some underdog outsider who only cares about doing what is right, but the reality couldn&#39;t be further from that concept.  What we do absolutely know about trump is that he has a history of defrauding people and rubbing shoulders with the other wealthy and powerful people.  </p>

<p>It bothers me to see people act like trump is some victim, because that puts him in a position where he can blame others for anything he does that people don&#39;t like, and people will believe him and take his words at face value.  Maybe trump does only want peace, but we don&#39;t know what his true intentions are and it is foolish to take his words at face value when he has a history of lying to people.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>All we really know about Trump is that he sees normal people as pawns and couldn&#39;t give less of a shit about them, that the only reason he is running for office is the money he can siphon out of it, and that he comes from the exact same background and crowd as the Clintons and that they&#39;re friends behind the scenes.

<p>Do you really think one candidate is the good guy and one is the bad? Or that the choice of executive leader is given to... what exactly? A plurality of most completely uninformed people who happen to have been born in the USA? Or that if said people really for the choice, these two candidates - who happen to be BFFs - would have been the best two options?</p>

<p>Its sort of a universally accepted fallacy these days that its always Giant Douche vs. Turd Sandwich. I believe Trump is the first legitimately good candidate in our lifetime and people are too cynical now to see it. Hillary Clinton is literally a criminal and has already sold out our government from a lower office. Trump basically already won life. He&#39;s rich and famous with an incredible family and capable of doing whatever he wants whenever he wants. He&#39;s been saying for decades that he doesn&#39;t want to run for office, but he&#39;s finally doing it because he honestly believes its gotten so bad that nobody else is capable of doing it.</p>

<p>Its a once in a lifetime opportunity to elect somebody for president that does not owe anyone anything and does not need anything himself. He will be the very definition of a public servant, not the beneficiary of public office.</p>

<p>The argument of who deserves to vote is pretty stupid and irrelevant. Won&#39;t bother there... and no, they aren&#39;t BFFs. Unless your BFFs file frivolous rape lawsuits against you.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>That&#39;s an incredible leap of logic. He&#39;s saying that we&#39;re effectively all in this together in terms of economic prosperity, that economic turmoil crosses borders. How you tie that to a specific position on a specific piece of legislation is beyond me. One thing&#39;s for sure though: Hillary Clinton called TPP the gold standard for trade deals and her husband signed NAFTA.</p>

<p>That wasn&#39;t at all the point I was trying to make. What I mean is that from the perspective of the ruling class that&#39;s what we are, and they sure as hell aren&#39;t handing the reins over to us any time soon. If nothing else this election should have taught us that.. remember the DNC primary, after all. Which is part of why I think all this is immaterial anyway - I mean, I&#39;ll still vote, because it&#39;s kind of fun, but come on, we know how this is going to turn out, don&#39;t we? </p>

<p>It&#39;s not so incredible. If you were being incredibly reductionist you could argue that TOP/NAFTA enable global trade at the potential cost to local economies and jobs in the wealthier trading prtner country. Trump and Clinton are both globalist extremists. Maybe that&#39;s the only way forward that will work, maybe not, but they both bullshit and pretend to want limits on &quot;free trade&quot; and support elements of a protected economy, while just a couple years (or days, in Clinton&#39;s case) previous they went on the record with their ubprecedented love of globalism.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is pretty typical protocol. However, quite sly if this whole thing was done specifically to stop the NYPD investigation. I have my doubts about this because the NYPD probably weren&#39;t going to get anywhere with those emails anytime soon and they also weren&#39;t going to get anywhere in general because they weren&#39;t going to get access to the emails and other evidence the FBI already had. There would be no way to cross check anything. </p>

<p>If this is true, it may be a power move by the FBI to get the emails and other evidence in their position, and their position only. The FBI has a better ability to keep that stuff safe without anything leaking. There is probably more damning stuff in those emails other than a couple being classified. </p>

Wait till the information is leaked by the NYPD and have a situation where it looks like the FBI now has double the amount of emails they initially had and are trying to keep it on the down low, or give the appearance of being totally forward and transparent by announcing it before anyone else does, knowing fully well that you&#39;ll whitewash HRC a second time before the election?

    <div class="md"><p>I think more important than job security situations involved in protesting in the US is something that no one ever talks about: The US is enormous for one country, with an enormous population. We don&#39;t have a few major cities to protest in, we have dozens or hundreds spread out over several thousand miles and also seperated by wide gulfs of culture (relatively speaking).</p>

<p>Even if mass protests occur in the capital city, that&#39;s just one place representing a tiny fraction of the population. The coordination required is nigh impossible by itself, ignoring the motivation required.</p>

<p>It&#39;s the same reason the style of democratic socialism practiced in much of Europe is just <em>not possible</em> on the US scale, in my opinion.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I actually think live protesting is old fashioned and counter productive.</p>

<p>You know what they do at protests now? Collect surveillance on the protestors, plant false dissidents who break shit, and then use said incidence to delegitimize the issue at hand, and increase surveillance laws and further militarization of the police. No thanks. I don&#39;t feel like getting a faceful of pepper spray, water gunned, or arrested for expressing my first amendment right.</p>

<p>In the past, the goal of protests were to call attention to a subject, so that the media would report on it and get others to care. We no longer require the media to bestow importance on information, thank God. We also don&#39;t have to physically assemble in order to disperse information. </p>

<p>Ergo, protests are useless. We are not lazy for not engaging in them; we&#39;re just smarter.   </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Are you kidding me? What exactly would <em>protest</em> accomplish? If it were a non-violent protest we would be shrugged off &amp; dismissed as &quot;crazy sore losers&quot; by the media and the sheeple who believe the media. Not only that, but most people can&#39;t afford to take off of work to spend time &quot;protesting.&quot; Many of us have families to care for that need food and a safe place to live. If violent protest - the military is more than prepared for that, and the elite would love that more than anything because they would get to unleash their baby - martial law. That would be their dream come true. Sorry, but I don&#39;t advocate putting people&#39;s lives in danger just to most likely make the situation worse. The corruption is too severe and average Americans are <em>utterly incapable</em> of successfully rebelling against this nation&#39;s military. This isn&#39;t the 1800s. They have weapons far beyond what we&#39;re capable of attaining as average citizens. You don&#39;t know what you&#39;re talking about.</p>

<p>It would show them that there is zero fear in The People, which is all I can grasp from your comment - fear.</p>

<p>It would also accomplish much more than sitting at home liking and disliking Facebook comments or upvoting and downvoting Reddit threads and their comments.</p>

<p>Not happening. 1) I have 2 small kids to take care of, 2) I&#39;m 7 months pregnant, and 3) I refuse to put my safety at risk to &quot;protest&quot; (mainly because of the first 2 reasons stated)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Unfortunately we are victims of a society that tells our history operates in a most Carlylean way. &quot;Great men move history&quot; is what we are subliminally taught and being that we aren&#39;t one of them learned helplessness takes over as we wait for a hero. We wait for an MLK, we wait for Ghandi, we wait for Jesus Damn Christ when if we were to change the paradigms we simply need those willing to fight the good fight.</p>

<p>We need someone willing to die for the cause and those types are in short supply when the populace is well fed and entertained. You have too much to live for to be the spark, to preform that all important act. I don&#39;t believe I am the person to do it either due to cowardice or otherwise but every bit of me wants it to happen.</p>

They won&#39;t admit it, but the jails are overcrowded as it is. They can only &quot;arrest&quot; so many people before they have to start thinking of a better solution. Force the government to shut down. Block them from getting to their jobs, shut down the streets around government facilities and make them listen. The international media, corrupt or not, will have no choice but to cover it. Refuse to cease and desist until they take action. Do not get violent but don&#39;t back down. Make them call the police and then the Army. If they continue to escalate the situation with weapons and violence, the outside world, (Other first-world countries), will get involved. If there is enough outrage, they will have no choice but to give in.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not saying vote for Trump, but how can someone vote for:</p>

<pre><code>someone that is a complete LIAR
someone funded by SAUDI ARABIA (worst state in Middle East - funding lots of radicals)
someone who has HUMA ABEDIN (ties to Radical Islam) in the team
someone who funds personal things from her foundation
someone who was psycho-happy that Khadaffi was KILLED like a dog (I wonder what Americans would feel like if Obama was killed in the same fashion - no trial no nothing)
someone who wants war with RUSSIA

<p>You guys REALLY are either just stupid not to see it all, or just BLIND.</p>

<p>If she really wins we will see a WORLD WAR THREE in our lifetime...</p>

And even if they don&#39;t dismiss you, you have to inform them about so much &amp; about such complicated issues in a concise yet logical way that doesn&#39;t lean too partisan. Not playing Devils Advocate with you, but that&#39;s how hard it is. Most people don&#39;t even know about Qadaffi or about Wikileaks</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So many friends ( on Facebook and real life) are so upset right now about the way this election turned out. I am thinking of deleting Facebook for the mere fact that so many of these people refuse to see how much more evil hrc was and that she should of been thrown in jail months ago. Is it right that someone can be so vocal about hrc and not anyone else? Should I feel ashamed that I can&#39;t support/ join in their frustration that their corrupted messiah didn&#39;t win? In a way it&#39;s like hrc won the election considering all the posts im seeing on fb right now. I don&#39;t know who to side with or show compassion to. Shouldn&#39;t we all be happy that a criminal didn&#39;t take office? It&#39;s very depressing for me to see these people who I care very much about, who I call my closest companions, who I have shared life with, so lost and blind about the world around them. I have this yearning to share the posts  that i see up on r/conspiracy with these people but i don&#39;t want them to judge me and think I&#39;m some sort of traitor to my own country. Even though a criminal didn&#39;t win and knowing this time around that justice might finally be served, I can&#39;t share this relief amongst my social circle and this to me is even more defeating than a criminal taking office because I feel like I&#39;m the criminal even though I did not vote for either trump or Hillary. Tonight, I will fall asleep with an internal joy though bittersweet and especially silent because I was not born blind, but with an ability to see the world differently. The world works in mysterious ways and tonight was proof of that. Maybe tonight was planned, maybe it wasn&#39;t but it goes to show that we ought to start putting our belief, our strength, and our worries into something that&#39;s more true. What that truth is, I don&#39;t really know right now but at least we have 4 years to figure it out. Sorry for the long rant but I really had no where else to go or talk to. It&#39;s especially comforting to know that some of you might be feeling like this too. Thanks for listening. </p>

<p>In the end this whole drama soaked emotional campaign of psyops and mass misinformation will be glossed over by tomorrow or Thursday.</p>

<p>I really wish our vote could elect someone who could impart meaningful change, someone who has the best interests of the people at large. Centralized government is too disconnected from the people it rules, power needs to be disseminated in smaller pockets, where the people that have it can interact with those who support them at a community level.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s to 4 more years of increased debt, more wars, more taxes, bigger government, and more secret government cover-ups. In other words, business as usual, regardless of who gets elected, because guess what, the people we elect don&#39;t make the rules. They never have, and they never will, the president, and our elected representatives are slaves and PR men for the real rulers.</p>

You had Bernie, you stupid morons, and you chose the one everyone hates. Once again America can&#39;t be trusted with as much as a piece of string. Someone call the Queen, it&#39;s time to make that place a colony again. You lot are clearly unfit to self-govern and all of the CTR idiots, who so smuggly hjacked r politics and ruined the place for everyone have done their part towards this. Seeing them fail feels so good but seeing Trump and not Bernie win makes me sick. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Welp</p>

<p>It&#39;s finally here, and boy have I been dreading this day.</p>

<p>Tomorrow we will have a corrupt treasonous lying bitch as our new president despite it all.</p>

<p>The chosen one. </p>

<p>It is her turn after all!</p>

<p>I&#39;m not a Trump fan by any means, but thinking about Clinton being the next president after cheating her way to this point (not to mention everything else)  truly saddens me. The bitch should be in jail.</p>

<p>Feelings of change are enveloping the nation at the moment and it&#39;s hard not getting caught up in it all, but when you are honest with yourself and take a good look at the situation it&#39;s easy to see we are not headed towards any positive change and things will most likely be getting worse. Which sucks.</p>

<p>But hey, maybe Trump will win and he really is everything the people over at T_D say he is. I&#39;m not holding my breath though.</p>

<p>Many round here feel like voting is pointless, and it probably is. But the way I look at it that you&#39;re not really losing anything by going out and doing it, and on the off chance your ballot doesn&#39;t land on a small fire somewhere, well at least you cast your vote. </p>

<p>Grab some alcohol and sit back and enjoy the show. Good luck to us all.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I see one of three things that are almost guaranteed to happen when Clinton is installed as president:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>She will escalate things so bad with Russia that nuclear war will break out. She will keep pushing &quot;missile defense systems&quot; capable of launching missiles all the way to Moscow so close to their border that they will feel threatened and snap. I wouldn&#39;t blame them either. I can&#39;t imagine how Putin feels towards the West. Our leaders literally do not negotiate and use diplomacy. It&#39;s war first, talk later. Hillary has said herself several times that she will go hard on Russia. She is an evil war hawk, no doubt about it. At least Trump has talked about de-escalating tensions with them.</p></li>
<li><p>There will be massive reports and evidence of voter fraud which will make people so mad that they&#39;ll actually do something. Massive riots all over the country and a policeman will end up killing some unarmed kid which will then provoke retaliation. The Second American Civil War. Another more plausible scenario is that Clinton will go hard on the Second Amendment and provoke protests and riots that way.</p></li>
<li><p>Another 9/11 false flag attack on the USA to get people to forget everything and go back to the way things were. Another Iraq  War, millions more dead in the name of &quot;fighting terrorism&quot;. This cycle will continue, and decades later, through the use of new technology and more complex social conditioning, people will be so dumb and sedated that they&#39;ll give up all of their rights without resistance, starting with the 2nd. The few true patriots left in the country that fight back will be labeled as crazy evil terrorists and be shot down. Brave New World.</p></li>

    <div class="md"><p>The election will be &quot;pre-determined.&quot; The technology exists to do it, and so it will be done. 9/11 was the coup that started it all, the most perceptive among the intelligentsia caught on quickly and were outright co-opted or have generally independently accepted their condition as &quot;peons&quot; who are just along for the ride. Life is a spectacle decided and projected by the establishment elite and realized by the relevant sectors of the economy (media, Hollywood, Silicon Valley, etc.): so just enjoy the &quot;movie&quot; and hope at most for a well-enough paying job while doing it. &quot;Reality&quot; (that antiquated concept)--possibly not even the elites care for/can keep track of it at this point.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>“They say we need more money for education. That’s the big answer to everything, education. They say we need more money for books, more teachers, more classrooms, more schools, and more testing for the kids, and they’ll say, well we tried all of that, and the kids still can’t pass the tests. Don’t worry about that, because we’re going to lower the passing grades, and that’s what they do in a lot of these schools. They lower the passing grades so more kids can pass – more kids pass, the school looks goods, and the IQ of the country slips another 2 or 3 points. And pretty soon all you’ll need to get into college is a pencil. Got a pencil? Then get in there, it’s physics!</p>

<p>Then people wonder why 17 other countries graduate more scientist than we do. Education – politicians use that word, they use it on you. Politicians have traditionally hidden behind 3 things: the flag, the bible, and children – no child left behind, no child left behind. Oh, really it wasn’t too long ago you were talking about giving children a head start. Head start – left behind, someone’s losing ground here, but there’s a reason. There’s a reason for this. There’s a reason education sucks, and it’s the same reason it’ll never ever be fixed – it’s never going to get any better, don’t look for it, be happy with what you got, because the owners of this country don’t want that. I’m talking about the real owners now. The wealthy big business interests that controls things, and makes all the important decisions.</p>

<p>Forget the politicians, they’re irrelevant. The politicians are put there to give you the idea you have freedom of choice – you don’t. You have no choice. You have owners. They own you. They own everything. They own all the important land. They own, and control the corporations. They’ve long since bought, and payed for the senate, the congress, the state houses, the city halls, they got the judges in their back pockets, and they own all the big media, so they control just about all the information you get. They got you by the balls. They spend billions of dollars every year lobbying – lobbying, to get what they want.</p>

<p><strong>Well we know what they want. They want more for themselves, and less for everybody else, but I’ll tell you what they don’t want – they don’t want a population of citizens capable of critical thinking. They don’t want well informed, well educated people capable of critical thinking. They’re not interested in that – that doesn’t help them. That’s against their interests. That’s right. They don’t want people that are smart enough to sit around a kitchen table, and think about how badly they’re getting screwed by a system that threw them overboard 30 fucking years ago. They don’t want that. You know what they want? Obedient workers – Obedient workers, people who are just smart enough to run the machines, and do that paper work. And just dumb enough to passively accept all these increasingly shittier jobs with the lower pay, the longer hours, the reduced benefits, the end of overtime, and vanishing pension that disappear the minute you go to collect it, and now they’re coming for your social security money. They want your retirement money. They want it back so they can give it to their criminal friends on Wall Street, and you know something? They’ll get it – they’ll get it all from you sooner or later cause they own this place. It’s a big club, and you aint in it. You, and I are not in The Big Club.</strong></p>

<p>By the way, it’s the same big club they use to beat you over the head with all day long when they tell you what to believe. All day long beating you over the head with their media telling you what to believe, what to think, and what to buy.</p>

<p>The table has tilted folks. The game is rigged, and nobody seems to notice. Nobody seems to care. Good honest hard working people: white collar, blue collar it doesn’t matter what color shirt you have on. Good honest hard working people continue (these are people of modest being) – continue to elect these rich douchebags who don’t give a fuck about you. They don’t give a fuck about you – they don’t give a fuck about you. They don’t care about you at all – at all – at all, and nobody seems to notice. Nobody seems to care.</p>

<p>That’s what the owners counted on. The fact that Americans will probably remain willfully ignorant of the big red, white, and blue dick that’s being jammed up their assholes everyday, because the owners of this country know the truth. It’s called the American Dream cause you have to be asleep to believe it.”</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My apologies.  </p>

<p>I googled:  Voting Results 2016</p>

<p>A live Google feed will come up.  If you select:  President --&gt; Popular Vote, you can see how well they&#39;re doing.  It isn&#39;t a breakdown by state, but you can extrapolate from the numbers given and figure it out.  </p>

<p>In case you were wondering, 3rd party is getting crucified.  No matter how ridiculous the Dems and Reps get, somehow everyone still votes for them.  This is a herd mentality I&#39;ll never understand.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Never voted until this year&#39;s primary debates. Voted for Sanders , not because I believed in him, but because I thought maybe there was a chance they couldn&#39;t steal it if enough people voted against Hillary.</p>

<p>Voted Stein today.  Here&#39;s why...</p>

<p>Again, I don&#39;t believe in this candidate  (or my vote being counted for that matter)</p>

<p>I would love to believe Trump is the anti establishment Messiah,  but I don&#39;t.  </p>

<p>Hillary is an absolute monster but nothing we&#39;ve done, nor the mountain of evidence against her, has stopped her or swayed the lemmings that will vote for her.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve read on this sub that if the green party gets x% of votes they have to appear at the convention next time (or something like that)</p>

<p>Someone close to me specifically stated that they wouldn&#39;t vote green because they voted Nader during the Gore vs Bush election and they believe it cost Gore the election.  I&#39;m really not sure if a vote for Stein is a vote for Clinton or a vote for Trump. I don&#39;t know which of the two my vote is (hypothetically) helping but I hope my vote for Stein is hurting Clinton.</p>

<p>My hope is that my vote, if counted , will lead to this x% being met, forcing a third party into the limelight next time around.
I really can&#39;t believe in spite of everything we still couldn&#39;t get people to snap out of their A or B ONLY mentality this time around. There were SO many reasons to try something new.</p>

<p>Also worth noting, I live in CA and  I&#39;m fairly certain I was given a provisional ballot during the primary.  Me and a lot of friends (some who have voted and some who haven&#39;t in the past) were all mailed ballots back in May/June even though this had never happened to any of us before. A lot of us went to our polling places.</p>

<p>This is Reddit Conspiracy so I&#39;m pretty sure everyone is up to date on the theory that all of the Bernie votes that were provisional were tossed. Today I went to the polling place and was told that I had requested an absentee balot. The next three people who came in were also told this. Once again,  I was given a provisional ballot.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It is incredibly unlikely for Trump supporters to get the president they want. The first point to note is that, if Trump were truly anti-establishment and had any chance to win in fair elections, he would probably not have been allowed to run by the Republicans.</p>

<p>But more importantly, the American and international oligarchy has chosen Hillary, so a fair vote in honest elections is highly unlikely. If the elections are not rigged sufficiently and Trump does win (which is a giant if), AND he is actually anti-establishment, then he will probably be assassinated or neutralized in some other way.</p>

Elections aren&#39;t about winning everyone over, it&#39;s about winning just enough and throwing enough shit towards the other person to get by as their voters jump ship. Trump loses nothing by getting slandered by Clinton. There&#39;s a reason why the more popular he got, the more outlandish things he said. His job was never to try and win, it was just to destroy the credibility of the GOP (Jeb is ruined, Rubio probably wont win back his Senate seat, lying Ted is mostly tarnished) and make Hillary look good by comparison as he made himself look like a fool and took a bunch of shit. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>When people get on here and claim the NWO/Zionists/Illuminati run the world and that the election is already fixed do you <em>really</em> believe they only had one candidate and that Trump is some sort of messiah? It boggles my mind that one of the most fraudulent and arrogant men in the world has managed to convince large groups of people that he is a holy pariah, free of all political sin and that he&#39;s here to wash away the sins of the establishment and MAGA!<br/>
On the Hillary side I also find it interesting that people have so much faith in the FBI when they have been confirmed to have MURDERED MLK and all the dastardly deeds done in COINTELPRO including murdering Black Panthers.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Of course they still do. But let me give you some insight on something that will expose the contradictions on the other side. You know how you have all these Trump supporters or people against Hillary saying the DOJ is corrupt? How on one hand can they call them corrupt yet cite the FBI studies about blacks and crime? You would think that they would know that the stats they&#39;re citing are limited (because of the way the FBI collects and how they collect from) and that the BJS, which is a part of the DOJ, would have the most stats (and they do).</p>

<p>So the hypocrisy is uncanny with these people, I&#39;ve never seen anything like it before in my life.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Why It&#39;s Better for Clinton to Win:</p>

<p>For a long time I thought Trump would be better.  But hear me out why Clinton might actually be the better president.  Trump is pulling an Obama on us.  Once in he won&#39;t do what we hope, and then the &quot;left&quot; is going to rage and rage about social issues (sexism/race/lgbt) instead of government/war/corruption.</p>

<p>If Clinton wins then the &quot;left&quot; will magically think all the social issues are solved and have nothing else to focus on except war/corruption.  Scary Trump will no longer be a reason to turn a blind eye to Clinton.  So with Trump we will get a defusement of the population and only anger at trivial/divisive issues.  With Clinton the anger will stay directed at the real problems.  Because neither candidate will actually fix things, so I feel maybe we are being played with Trump as another Obama, to pacify the right this time.  Trump would actually be a brilliant move for the globalists if this is true.</p>

<p>(Disclaimer: I would never vote for a neocon like Clinton nor encourage you to.  Just reflecting on the benefits of the likely outcome.)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sam Wang via Princeton Election Consortium: &quot;11:44pm: The business about 65%, 91%, 93%, 99% probability is a sideshow. Instead, the key point here is that the entire polling industry – public, campaign-associated, aggregators – ended up with data that missed tonight’s results by a very large margin. There is now the question of understanding how a mature industry could have gone so wrong. And of course, most of all, there is the shock of a likely Trump presidency.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was sitting down talking with my mother about this few months ago. I remember saying that: &quot;In the event that Trump wins presidency and Hillary doesn&#39;t, HRC and every other Elite organization out there will have strings on him just as soon as he gets inaugurated, if not now. We were so busy worrying about Hillary&#39;s shit and exploiting her, we didn&#39;t stop and think maybe this what they want us to and this is how its going to be planned out.&quot; Not particularly worried if he wins, all race issues and ignorance aside, I&#39;m more so worried on the time span from now to January and the FFs, riots, and eventual martial law that&#39;s going to come with it, if a nuke doesn&#39;t happen first.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Here&#39;s my theory:</p>

<p>A shadowy figure is behind it all.</p>

<p><em>Someone</em> hacked the DNC.</p>

<p>This <em>someone</em> could easily have sown seeds of discord within the Dems.</p>

<p><em>Someone</em> provided Wikileaks with that data.</p>

<p><em>Someone</em> got the FBI to announce the second email batch right before election, despite complete peer discouragement.</p>

<p><em>Someone</em> is an evil mastermind who got Clinton to kill off Bernie&#39;s campaign, and the US to elect a potentially impeachable PotUS.</p>

<p>Mike Pence is basically living the plot of House of Cards.</p>

<p>Trump did not look happy. A few possibilities.</p>

<p>A. Hillary made the elites mad. So they decided to give it to Trump.
B. Trump made them mad. So they decided to give it to Trump.
C. Possibly a third-term for Obama, so it won&#39;t matter.
D. A bizarre combination of all of the above</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My theory.</p>

<ul>
<li>   PA was TRUMP&#39;s 1-2 hours before they called it. You had commentators saying things like, PA is going to go TRUMP&#39;s way, but we&#39;re not calling it yet.</li>
<li>   The NYT suddenly changed their percent of vote counted in PA from 98% to 89% about 1/2 hr before they called it</li>
<li>   hillary did not concede.</li>
<li>   The Dow Jones was down 800 pts.</li>
</ul>

<p>Then TRUMP got a call from the Rothchilds or other global elitist political donor insider oligarch.</p>

<p>They said, we have people in PA who will turn the election for us. We will tank the stock market.</p>

<p>And TRUMP had to cut a deal.</p>

<p>That&#39;s why the 1-2 hour delay in calling PA. TRUMP was deal-making with the global elites.</p>

<p>They would rather cut a deal with TRUMP than have hillary.</p>

<p>HRC: DJT sucks<br/>

In Hillary, we have the perfect node to link up all the interlinking pieces. And it&#39;s for that and that alone that I thank her. I hope she wins... that&#39;s the only way she&#39;ll be held to account. Think about it - Hillary Clinton. President of America. Getting grilled in congress about the CF. You have ambitious republicans with careers to launch, as well as older heads with scores to settle. Not to mention Bernie. I need one of you guys to tell me I&#39;m not just being wilfully naive when I say that the real reckoning will come once she&#39;s won. Just lay it on me .. I can take it. </p>

The Democratic party through the magic of predictive analytics not only anticipated, but created the main strategic geography of this election, right down to the ex-nihilo “Pied Piper” persona of Donald Trump (again per Wikileaks’ revelations). The purpose, besides winning of course, is twofold, use the creation of the strategic geography to control, indeed “drive” the election to the desired outcome; to present said strategic geography as alibi in the case of an even more controlled and technically pre-determined outcome–in which case the aforesaid alibi of the magic of predictive analytics serves to mask the outright falsity of the election results.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>A few questions: How does a presidential pardon work? Can Obama pardon Hillary if she loses (not likely, just entertain the idea), in order to try and cover his own ass because he is, at the very least, implicated in the server scandal? Or can the president only pardon people if they have charges against them?</p>

<p>If Hillary does win, I don&#39;t think Obama will pardon her at all because she&#39;ll be able to pardon herself once she&#39;s in and pardoning her would only make him look suspicious. </p>

<p>Is it possible at all that the rank and file of the FBI know this and are planning on letting her steal the election so that they can have evidence of intent and then also execution, and then timing her arrest for the moment of transition of power, so that Obama can&#39;t pardon anyone, and she won&#39;t have had any time to pardon herself?</p>

<p>These are just my random, probably too hopeful thoughts this morning. </p>

<p>This election is one big distraction. Everyone is focused on it. Guess what happens when you aren&#39;t looking. Atrocity. There will be no news of the DAPL protest today. They don&#39;t want you to hear it. But it will be a great time and excuse for them to take out people who oppose them through death or prison. Just wait. If and when they are heard from again, it will have gotten much worse.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Would be an interesting 4 years of Trump wins. I&#39;m from the UK, so with us leaving the EU and Trump being in power over in the US, it will make for chaos. In an odd way (if trump wins), I think it shows that the people are slowly starting to turn away from doing what we are told. Politics aside, the fact that million will go out and vote for things to be different (actual difference, completely unthinkable) gives me a small bit of hope for the planet. Perhaps we are not nations of drones?</p>

The Hillary voters are DC, by large majority, Maryland, LA and SF, Seattle...and Hispanic areas in Texas, Az, Ca...  So some opinion.  DC is the core of corruption in the US, and radiates out, eg MD.  the LGBT and Hispanic vote accounts for the West coast Hillary vote.  Maine and Michigan? dk.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The narrative usually implies that there is a secret behemoth pulling the strings behind the curtains and that regardless of vote or hope their puppet will always win, today that narrative was dismantled. Many times did I hear that Hillary was fixed to win, drummed in my ear, bought and paid for etc. Bottom line, there is no boogeyman fixing the vote, people are just either smart or stupid. Most of the times stupid (dnc), but so is human nature. Let&#39;s see how this plays out.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The only reason she didnt win is because we caught all the vote manipulation and machine &quot;malfunctions&quot; during the election process. She needed waayy more than the homeless and deceased votes, and those were due to come from the corrupt machines. Look at the states they held off on calling forver last night - AZ, MI, PA, WI - all of these states had massive machine malfunctions and ballots thrown out. The race was ridiculously close, she lost by 1-2% in these locations and those are the votes they had to rig to win. You cant rig an election and win by +5-9 pts in battle grounds, its too &quot;coincidental&quot;. Thats also why they were refusing to call it for trump, they literally recounted PA because they couldnt believe we out voted their &quot;fix&quot;. No damn way it took an east coast state til 2:45am to count votes and release the electoral winner. This race was over when she lost FL and OH. At the end they were just clinging for a sweep in hopes of a 269 tie. </p>

<p>What do you make of</p>

<ul>
<li>   PA was TRUMP&#39;s 1-2 hours before they called it. You had commentators saying things like, PA is going to go TRUMP&#39;s way, but we&#39;re not calling it yet.</li>
<li>   The NYT suddenly changed their percent of vote counted in PA from 98% to 89% about 1/2 hr before they called it</li>
<li>   hillary did not concede.</li>
<li>   The Dow Jones was down 800 pts. then suddenly it was only down 300 pts.</li>

    <div class="md"><p>They definitely were trying to fix the election and I saw all the same fluctuations of vote% and DOW#&#39;s across Fox/CBS/NBC/PBS. When they showed the counties of PA that were &quot;undecided&quot; I actually knew of 3 that are legitimately redder than Texas. Surprisingly, or not, all 3 of these counties are major union/industrial areas for blue collar crowd. Fix the election or we fuck your retirement type fears. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>All kinds of funny business was going on.  Trump was ahead in Virgina and Hillary surged ahead 6% in the last 8% reporting.  NH counts were just not coming, leaving a path open for hillary.  Maybe they were waiting for everybody to go to sleep and find some more votes that were &#39;missed&#39;.  Counties all over the us map were holding out reporting, playing a wait and see game trying to figure out how many ballots they needed.  CA was called for Hillary 1 minute after the polls closed giving Hillary an artificial momentum.<br/>
There was so much bullshit! the media just stalling waiting for a miracle. while the vote counters tried to get it close enough to go for a recount.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m glad everyone else noticed the PA stuff and I wasn&#39;t just seeing things.</p>

<p>Around 1:45-2 am eastern, I was watching the fox stream in bed. At that point I was just waiting for them to call PA and NYT had Trump at &gt;95% to win. </p>

<p>I <em>knew</em> he was going to win but I was just trying to stay awake until it was official. Then Podesta went in front of the Clinton supporters telling everyone they&#39;re not doing anything until all the votes were counted and CNN kept acting like there was still some kind of chance Hillary would win, so I didn&#39;t want to miss it somehow if it did happen.</p>

<p>At about 2 am, I saw that PA was 98% and fox said they didn&#39;t want to call it yet, but some other websites and stuff had already called it for Trump. I figured I&#39;d find out any second now since they only had 2% to go.</p>

<p>5 or 10 minutes later, fox shows the PA graphic and somehow it said 68%? I was absolutely confused and kept trying to think how the fuck I saw it so wrong just 10 minutes earlier. I checked NYT and somehow his percentage fell all the way down to like 70 something.. so I said fuck it at around 2:15, really confused and wondering if there was some sort of fuckery afoot or if I was just too tired to read properly.</p>

<p>So I went to sleep. I wake up later and see that my mom had texted me at 2:45 am from work saying they called it for Trump. About 20 mins after I said fuck it and went to sleep because PA had somehow dropped 20-30% in counts like they just lost votes somehow.</p>

<p>The whole thing was bizarre and I&#39;m glad other people were noticing things got weird.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>i mean people got the clinton loss so many were pushing for, but the question now is at what cost and why.  the very nature of elections in the US have so many people believeing that its all a show and voting is rigged anways so what is trumps purpose in this system?  hes clearly not the outsider people want to imagine him being, hes been involved with the elites ,even looking awfully friendly to the Clintons for most of his life.  you can go back 20 years or only just a handful of years back and hes said positive things about many of the people he &#39;ran against&#39;.  many of the people i have seen on lists of potential cabinet members are still the same corporate elite / establishment members.</p>

<p>im just amazed at how slow people have been to try and grapple with the idea that we voted a corrupt businessman(who has always used his money to sit at the edges of politics) in instead of a corrupt politician   </p>

<p>trumps possibly a puppet and was picked to win( of russia or god knows who else) or the grand conspiracy about voting being rigged is not true ( and then likely many others connected to it)</p>

<p>his temperament should scare everyone, look at how much the past few presidents aged during their terms and now imagine a man so impulsive that openly basically said comey was a partisan hack, a hero to his country, and then a partisan hack within the span of a few days.  now apply that sith mentality all day everyday for years</p>

<p><strong>tldr i know for many the celebrations of a non clinton presidency are still going but i wonder what is to happen when the reality of a trump presidency sets in</strong></p>

<p>Well, he would essentially be the republican version of Obama. False hope, no change. However, what&#39;s interesting is that if this were the case (which my gut tells me it is) it could reveal to a larger population - a population starting to wake up and is getting involved in populist movements - that leaders of these movements can be shills and controlled by the same system (or &#39;the powers that be&#39;), essentially cut from the same cloth. If that&#39;s the case....fuck, we&#39;ve got a long way to go.</p>

<p>It might be a waste of a vote but screw it, if I&#39;m voting then I&#39;m voting for the alternatives to these candidates, it&#39;s not like voting Clinton or Trump is any less of a waste in this sham.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you got enough people to do it sure, but you won&#39;t. The best course of action is mass organized protest on the capital. They won&#39;t admit it, but the jails are overcrowded as it is. They can only &quot;arrest&quot; so many people before they have to start thinking of a better solution. Force the government to shut down. Block them from getting to their jobs, shut down the streets around government facilities and make them listen. The international media, corrupt or not, will have no choice but to cover it. Refuse to cease and desist until they take action. Do not get violent but don&#39;t back down. Make them call the police and then the Army. If they continue to escalate the situation with weapons and violence, the outside world, (Other first-world countries), will get involved. If there is enough outrage, they will have no choice but to give in.</p>
