I&#39;m honestly not sure what to think in this case.

<p>It&#39;s a rabbit hole that can&#39;t be proven. How do we know that it&#39;s not all just a big diversion being hoisted upon us to make us look bad? And of course, if you point any of this out you are obviously CTR and no real discourse happens on the subject.</p>

<p>It&#39;s the same tactic with the &quot;HUGE REVELATIONS COMING&quot; that this sub has been saturated with every day. We are being brigaded by agent provocateurs and pied pipers.

<p>Look at Bill Clinton. He assaulted more women than we&#39;ll ever know about. Twenty plus women came forward and identified him as an abuser. All they got was criticism from the press, a ton of Monica Lewinsky jokes, and that was the end of the discussion. Now his wife is running for the same office that he formerly held. </p>

Many users here are are concerned about the saturation coverage of  this issue, being pushed by new accounts, and are questioning the apparent lack of actual evidence. It looks like a deliberate McAlpine distraction (see my other comment below).</p>

<p>So stop casting aspersions on other peoples&#39; motives, when your hysterical rants are equally open to question. Start collecting hard evidence. At this point, mentions of pizza in emails are not sufficient until evidence comes forward which actually connects this &quot;fast food&quot; hidden code with evidence of child abuse or child abductions.</p>

<p>By making a stickied mega thread, the information would all be in one convenient place.  I don&#39;t think there&#39;s anything there, however, since so many of you are determined, why not make it a megathread?  This way, all the information is nicely compiled, and the rest of us watching new don&#39;t have to see repeat pedophile threads that offer no new information.  It&#39;d be a win-win.

    <div class="md"><p>As a general rule we don&#39;t do megathreads, because it looks like an attempt to dampen discussion of the topic (which it is, of course). Unfortunately, it also means that we get situations like we have currently. Elite paedophile networks are very real, but the current batch of stories look like deliberate &quot;McAlpine disinfo&quot;.</p>

<p>Lord McAlpine was part of the British parliamentary paedophile network, but he deliberately allowed (perhaps even encouraged) a story which the media ran with, about him abusing young boys in a <del>Chester</del> Wrexham orphanage. He did this because that particular accusation was a case of mistaken identity, and he was able to PROVE it was somebody else with a similar name. Several newspapers and the BBC had to pay significant damages to him. Didn&#39;t mean he wasn&#39;t a paedophile. </p>

<p>I strongly suspect that the &quot;Madeleine McCann was abducted by the Podestas&quot; story  may be a McAlpine plant, and the Podestas could easily prove the story is false (eg because they were in the US at the time). Again, it wouldn&#39;t prove the Podestas were NOT involved in child abuse, just not this particular incident.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, but the man in the picture apparently was the cousin of Lord McAlpine, Jimmy McAlpine, who was already dead, so a safe limited hangout (the UK establishment is happy to throw dead paedos to the wolves to make it look like they are tackling the problem. The paedos who are still alive are protected.)</p>

<p>The media got their fingers burnt, and have been ultra cautious ever since. Their refusal to name Lord Brittan (also &quot;dead&quot;) has been particularly shameful.</p>
