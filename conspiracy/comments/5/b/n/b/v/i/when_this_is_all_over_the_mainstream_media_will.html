        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>After this is all over and the queen is crowned, please at least remember how our own media worked together to install their chosen candidate, the CORPORATE CANDIDATE, the military industrial complex candidate.  All of these pricks have been caught red-handed colluding.  The DNC has been PROVEN to be corrupt from top to bottom, even after they fired three heads <em>with</em> the Debbie Wasserman Schultz debacle.</p>

<p><strong>The media in the weeks ahead will attempt to go back to business as usual.</strong>  For the love of whatever you hold dear, turn off your TV.  Stop giving these people your attention, which gives them huge advertising dollars.  Turn off the lies that you have the privilege of paying for.  The propaganda no longer works.  They&#39;ve forced fear into your life, cajoled you, lied right to every americans face.  The media is supposed to protect the interests of americans, but has been sold to the highest bidder.  The 24 hour news cycle is subtle brain washing for the masses, for the benefit of the super rich.</p>

<p>In the future, please ask that CNN be turned off if playing in a public space.  Turn it all off.  They lie to you, all day, every day, and they count on your participation. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ah, but we are learning that CNN, NPR, AP, et al is also corrupt. In fact, it seems like exactly what we thought it was all along, two opposing sides facing off in an Info War. (I really hate to use that term. Thanks AJ.) I listen to all mainstream media. When looking at MSM you have to see the take on the same story from both perspectives, look at the differences between the two reports, and determine how their take fits into their agenda. You also have to review the source yourself, and the different connections those infer. Knowing who the MSM report to, and knowing which ones in specific, is an invaluable too to the entire conspiritard community.</p>

The media gives the people what they want, and they don&#39;t want truth, they don&#39;t want their reality changed, they certainly don&#39;t want to have pricing admit they have been fools this whole time and were dumb enough to fall for it. They simply want entertainment. Until we changed the schools and educate people the media will continue to get worse.</p>
