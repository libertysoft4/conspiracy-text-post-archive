    <div class="md"><p>Agreed, I&#39;m from Singapore and some people here were following the elections pretty closely too, though they were blinded by the biased pro-Shrillary/anti-Trump reporting by our government-owned TV station + newspapers, as well as the one-sided &#39;news&#39; on FB that demonised-Trump and made Hillary seem faultless.</p>

<p>And now all my social media feeds are filled with very angry youths (mostly females) who keep trashing Trump like it&#39;s gonna magically change the outcome (I&#39;m also a young female, but I would&#39;ve voted Trump over Hillary). They&#39;re the demographic who either don&#39;t know about Hillary&#39;s dishonesty or choose to ignore it, and who wholeheartedly lap up biased propaganda without questioning the truth.</p>

Generally speaking, all politicians are ass hats and the people who put blind faith in any one are only setting themselves up for despair.

<p>I want to ask though, are cases she was tasked to win as relevant as what Trump says and does in the hear and now? </p>

<p>Facing these candidates myself Trump is almost comically bad. Ultimately when it comes to policy every candidate will compromise, that&#39;s how ruling works. I&#39;m mostly concerned with the electorate and how its affected. It&#39;s just far too similar, to me as a European, to any right-wing election where fear is in the driver&#39;s seat. </p>

<p>*Her and her team actively attempting to frame Julian Assange as a pedophile, which, by the way, should prove that what he is saying about her is true. </p>

<p>*Clinton&#39;s campaign bribing the national media to favor her, which eradicates any trust in our media to give us unbiased facts and opinions so we can make an informed decision at the polls. </p>

<p>*Then there was the time she helped arm al-Qaeda, and ISIS</p>

<p>*And the time she knew the Saudi&#39;s were shipping weapons to terrorists in Syria...yet still accepts funding from the Saudis. </p>

<p>*Rigging the primaries against Bernie. </p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEQvsK5w-jY">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEQvsK5w-jY</a></p>

<p>*Multiple former Secret Service agents have gone on record of saying how rotten of a person she is, and how they were treated with no dignity or respect. If she treats Secret Service that way, what makes anyone think she gives a shit about any of us??</p>

<p><a href="http://www.msfanpage.link/record-hillarys-filthy-fking-potty-mouth-puts-trump-shame/">http://www.msfanpage.link/record-hillarys-filthy-fking-potty-mouth-puts-trump-shame/</a></p>

<p>*She supports fracking unabashedly, arguably one of the worst things we could be doing to our environment. </p>

<p>*30,000 classified emails transferred and deleted from an insecure server while she was S.o.S (which would be a felony for me and you by the way). </p>

<p>*Has accepted more donations from the arms industry than any candidate in history. </p>

<p>*Accepting more donations from the Saudi Royal Family than any candidate in history. </p>

<p>*Has helped Bill sweep his sexual misdeeds under the rug time and time again. </p>

<p>*CNN feeding the DNC chair the questions for debates..ya know, because teachers always gave me a cheat sheet when I had a test. </p>

<p><a href="http://vesselnews.io/wikileaks-cnn-caught-sharing-debate-questions-dnc-chair-passed-hillarys-campaign/">http://vesselnews.io/wikileaks-cnn-caught-sharing-debate-questions-dnc-chair-passed-hillarys-campaign/</a></p>

<p>*Was removed from her job as staff attorney for the House Judiciary Committee during Watergate by lifelong democrat Jeffrey Siefman, reason? He said &quot;because she is a liar. She was an unethical, dishonest lawyer, she conspired to violate the constitution, the rules of the House, the rules of the Committee, and the rules of confidentiality.&quot; </p>

<p>*And then there is Shahram Amiri. Who was an Iranian Scientist providing us with intel on Iranian nuclear activities as a spy, Hillary shared emails from him with staffers, and those emails got back to Iran. He was executed on 8-7-16 for helping the United States keep tabs on Iran&#39;s nuclear programs, he was executed as a direct result of Hillary&#39;s negligent actions, and as a result we now have no contact inside Iran regarding their nuclear activity. </p>

<p>*She put the national security at risk with her emails. She shared classified top secret documents on an insecure server that any hacker could find. And they have. </p>

<p>*The Clinton Foundation has been outed as basically being nothing more than organized crime. Raking in $128m last year, while only $5m went to Charity, $35m went to &quot;salaries&quot;, $30m to &quot;travel&quot;, and $50m to &quot;other&quot;. </p>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/LucidHurricane_/status/782698712392871936">https://twitter.com/LucidHurricane_/status/782698712392871936</a></p>

<p>*Leaked Colin Powell emails stating she isn&#39;t fit to run a nation. </p>

<p>*Pay to play. </p>

<p>*Has taken an ABSURD amount of donations from Wall Street. </p>

<p>*And these...</p>

<p><a href="http://www.thecanary.co/2016/10/10/5-explosive-clinton-campaign-emails-just-released-wikileaks-must-read-tweets/">http://www.thecanary.co/2016/10/10/5-explosive-clinton-campaign-emails-just-released-wikileaks-must-read-tweets/</a></p>

<p>*But wait, there&#39;s more! Here is her legal team literally advising her on how to break the law and not get caught. </p>

<p><a href="https://www.unformers.com/wikileaks-clinton-lawyers-advise-hillary-how-to-break-law-and-not-get-caught/">https://www.unformers.com/wikileaks-clinton-lawyers-advise-hillary-how-to-break-law-and-not-get-caught/</a></p>

<p>*Here she is sympathizing with Goldman Sachs (the bank which nearly, and probably will have a part in the economic collapse of this country). </p>

<p><a href="https://theintercept.com/2016/10/11/behind-closed-doors-hillary-clinton-sympathized-with-goldman-sachs-over-financial-reform/">https://theintercept.com/2016/10/11/behind-closed-doors-hillary-clinton-sympathized-with-goldman-sachs-over-financial-reform/</a></p>

<p>And don&#39;t forget, she also owes arms manufacturers a lot of favors..<em>cough cough war cough cough</em>..</p>

<p>So please, tell me again, how is this satanic bitch the lesser of two evils??  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Just reading the first few &quot;unbiased&quot; sources and there&#39;s no actual content. One even says how the New York Times even went ahead with an unredacted email. So much for biased media. </p>

<p>And those tweets about emails and warnings about Benghazi? They&#39;re not even emails. Just a screen cap of a pastebin saying Hillary did or didn&#39;t do this but what the heck makes that different from some Reddit post you or I type up here? It&#39;s serif so it&#39;s true?</p>

<p>And Trump, the republican candidate asking for email donations outside the US, supposedly never got any donation from any weapons company or gun lobby groups? Kay. </p>

<p>Why is all the anti Hillary news sites are these click bait sources with no real structure or evidence, and read like cheap tabloid rather than an investigative report? One of these is comparing what Trump said live on tape about assaulting women to quotes in anti Hillary books that are meant to be taken verbatim? Ok. </p>

<p>Hillary is for fracking? So is Trump. Though &quot;states and municipalities should choose&quot; which would raise eyebrows in the energy community but placate voters. It&#39;s an post sale comment and a deception, not an electoral promise or part of a manifesto. </p>

<p>I&#39;m not that invested here. I&#39;m not interested in GOP vs DNC. I&#39;m a foreigner, I&#39;ve seen my fair share of political scandals up close and people dressing up as Donald Ducks to ask about why he&#39;s ducked tax returns is about as vanilla as you can get. (It&#39;s a valid question, btw, given the vast amount of off shore shell companies he has set up at Mossack Fonseca. Not necessarily a bad thing, but definitely not straight and narrow)</p>

<p>This really isn&#39;t about the political machine. If anything, Trump is everything wrong with the political machine, and it is so fitting that he won via electoral college and not popular vote. </p>

<p>Is Hillary politic-Jesus? No, but neither is Trump. They&#39;re both political animals playing the game, one just has an idea about tact and what&#39;s possible in the Whitehouse. I mean, Trump couldn&#39;t keep the story on him ridiculing a disabled reporter straight. So he isn&#39;t even a &quot;tell it like it is&quot; guy, he&#39;s just a rude person that isn&#39;t clever enough to lie well. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hes owned by NBC now. I kind of think (polyanna me) Stewart wanted to stay above it. When Podesta hosted the off-the-record dinner for all the pundits and publishers Stewart was off the list but interestingly the email was sent on the 8th of May, 2015, (maybe 10?) two days later was the dinner and Jon Stewart announced retirement on the 20th. After retirement he did an (interview with David Axelrod)[<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Da5VYSPsoE0">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Da5VYSPsoE0</a>] at the University of Chicago where Axelrod teaches. And Stewart laid into him in front of the Student body. It was pretty great.</p>

<p>*30,000 classified emails transferred and deleted from an insecure server while she was S.o.S (which would be a felony for me and you by the way).</p>

<p>*Has accepted more donations from the arms industry than any candidate in history.</p>

<p>*Was removed from her job as staff attorney for the House Judiciary Committee during Watergate by lifelong democrat Jeffrey Siefman, reason? He said &quot;because she is a liar. She was an unethical, dishonest lawyer, she conspired to violate the constitution, the rules of the House, the rules of the Committee, and the rules of confidentiality.&quot;</p>

<p>*And then there is Shahram Amiri. Who was an Iranian Scientist providing us with intel on Iranian nuclear activities as a spy, Hillary shared emails from him with staffers, and those emails got back to Iran. He was executed on 8-7-16 for helping the United States keep tabs on Iran&#39;s nuclear programs, he was executed as a direct result of Hillary&#39;s negligent actions, and as a result we now have no contact inside Iran regarding their nuclear activity.</p>

<p>*She put the national security at risk with her emails. She shared classified top secret documents on an insecure server that any hacker could find. And they have.</p>

<p>*The Clinton Foundation has been outed as basically being nothing more than organized crime. Raking in $128m last year, while only $5m went to Charity, $35m went to &quot;salaries&quot;, $30m to &quot;travel&quot;, and $50m to &quot;other&quot;.</p>

<p>*Leaked Colin Powell emails stating she isn&#39;t fit to run a nation.</p>

<p>*Pay to play.</p>

<p>*Has taken an ABSURD amount of donations from Wall Street.</p>

<p>*And these...</p>

<p>*But wait, there&#39;s more! Here is her legal team literally advising her on how to break the law and not get caught.</p>

<p>*Here she is sympathizing with Goldman Sachs (the bank which nearly, and probably will have a part in the economic collapse of this country).</p>

<p>No personal attacks? On a Subreddit predominantly based on personal attacks? You fucking hypocrite. Censorship for difference of opinion is a disgrace. I hope the world is flat!! then perhaps one day you can drag you troglodyte mass to the edge and fall the fuck off the planet :) have a good day</p>

<p>*Multiple former Secret Service agents have gone on record of saying how rotten of a person she is, and how they were treated with no dignity or respect. If she treats Secret Service that way, what makes anyone think she gives a shit about any of us??</p>

<p><a href="http://www.msfanpage.link/record-hillarys-filthy-fking-potty-mouth-puts-trump-shame/">http://www.msfanpage.link/record-hillarys-filthy-fking-potty-mouth-puts-trump-shame/</a></p>

<p>*She supports fracking unabashedly, arguably one of the worst things we could be doing to our environment. </p>

<p>*30,000 classified emails transferred and deleted from an insecure server while she was S.o.S (which would be a felony for me and you by the way). </p>

<p>*Has accepted more donations from the arms industry than any candidate in history. </p>

<p>*Accepting more donations from the Saudi Royal Family than any candidate in history. </p>

<p>*Was removed from her job as staff attorney for the House Judiciary Committee during Watergate by lifelong democrat Jeffrey Siefman, reason? He said &quot;because she is a liar. She was an unethical, dishonest lawyer, she conspired to violate the constitution, the rules of the House, the rules of the Committee, and the rules of confidentiality.&quot; </p>

<p>*And then there is Shahram Amiri. Who was an Iranian Scientist providing us with intel on Iranian nuclear activities as a spy, Hillary shared emails from him with staffers, and those emails got back to Iran. He was executed on 8-7-16 for helping the United States keep tabs on Iran&#39;s nuclear programs, he was executed as a direct result of Hillary&#39;s negligent actions, and as a result we now have no contact inside Iran regarding their nuclear activity. </p>

<p>*She put the national security at risk with her emails. She shared classified top secret documents on an insecure server that any hacker could find. And they have. </p>

<p>*The Clinton Foundation has been outed as basically being nothing more than organized crime. Raking in $128m last year, while only $5m went to Charity, $35m went to &quot;salaries&quot;, $30m to &quot;travel&quot;, and $50m to &quot;other&quot;. </p>

<p>*Leaked Colin Powell emails stating she isn&#39;t fit to run a nation. </p>

<p>*Pay to play. </p>

<p>*Has taken an ABSURD amount of donations from Wall Street. </p>

<p>*And these...</p>

<p>*Her and her team actively attempting to frame Julian Assange as a pedophile, which, by the way, should prove that what he is saying about her is true.</p>

<p>*Clinton&#39;s campaign bribing the national media to favor her, which eradicates any trust in our media to give us unbiased facts and opinions so we can make an informed decision at the polls.</p>

<p>*Then there was the time she helped arm al-Qaeda, and ISIS</p>

<p>*Rigging the primaries against Bernie.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEQvsK5w-jY">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEQvsK5w-jY</a></p>

<p>*Multiple former Secret Service agents have gone on record of saying how rotten of a person she is, and how they were treated with no dignity or respect. If she treats Secret Service that way, what makes anyone think she gives a shit about any of us??</p>

<p>*She supports fracking unabashedly, arguably one of the worst things we could be doing to our environment.</p>

<p>*30,000 classified emails transferred and deleted from an insecure server while she was S.o.S (which would be a felony for me and you by the way).</p>

<p>*Has accepted more donations from the arms industry than any candidate in history.</p>

<p>*Accepting more donations from the Saudi Royal Family than any candidate in history.</p>

<p>*CNN feeding the DNC chair the questions for debates..ya know, because teachers always gave me a cheat sheet when I had a test.</p>

<p>*Was removed from her job as staff attorney for the House Judiciary Committee during Watergate by lifelong democrat Jeffrey Siefman, reason? He said &quot;because she is a liar. She was an unethical, dishonest lawyer, she conspired to violate the constitution, the rules of the House, the rules of the Committee, and the rules of confidentiality.&quot;</p>

<p>*And then there is Shahram Amiri. Who was an Iranian Scientist providing us with intel on Iranian nuclear activities as a spy, Hillary shared emails from him with staffers, and those emails got back to Iran. He was executed on 8-7-16 for helping the United States keep tabs on Iran&#39;s nuclear programs, he was executed as a direct result of Hillary&#39;s negligent actions, and as a result we now have no contact inside Iran regarding their nuclear activity.</p>

<p>*She put the national security at risk with her emails. She shared classified top secret documents on an insecure server that any hacker could find. And they have.</p>

<p>*The Clinton Foundation has been outed as basically being nothing more than organized crime. Raking in $128m last year, while only $5m went to Charity, $35m went to &quot;salaries&quot;, $30m to &quot;travel&quot;, and $50m to &quot;other&quot;.</p>

<p>*Leaked Colin Powell emails stating she isn&#39;t fit to run a nation.</p>

<p>*Pay to play.</p>

<p>*Has taken an ABSURD amount of donations from Wall Street.</p>

<p>*And these...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hes owned by NBC now. I kind of think (polyanna me) Stewart wanted to stay above it. When Podesta hosted the off-the-record dinner for all the pundits and publishers Stewart was off the list but interestingly the email was sent on the 8th of May, 2015, (maybe 10?) two days later was the dinner and Jon Stewart announced retirement on the 20th. After retirement he did an (interview with David Axelrod)[<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Da5VYSPsoE0">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Da5VYSPsoE0</a>] at the University of Chicago where Axelrod teaches. And Stewart laid into him in front of the Student body. It was pretty great.</p>
