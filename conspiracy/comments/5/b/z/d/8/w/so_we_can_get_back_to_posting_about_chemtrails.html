<p>Say for example your brother got arrested for fraud but got off with it, the whole time telling you and family he didn&#39;t do it. Everyone outside your family think you all know the truth but in reality you have no idea, the evidence was there and he was acting suspicious for a few months, your mom will have another theory, your dad might have been in on it but is keeping quiet.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Clinton is one of the people on the inside, the reason it wasn&#39;t rigged is because 1. It would have been waaaay to obvious, I mean after all the scandals we are supposed to believe she actually could win? And I see people typing shit like &quot;If Trump wins expect riots&quot; It&#39;s the other way around if Hillary would have won everyone would know how bad the system really is. Also remember the rigged voting when it was Bernie vs Hillary? that popped up and lingered for weeks after the election. </p>

<p>Also 2, it doesn&#39;t really matter who is POTUS until the person elected goes against their views. That&#39;s when it becomes a problem for the &quot;Insiders&quot; and it just so happens Trump is a huge fan of Netanyahu so that means they still got their fix in the middle east vs Israel conflict. Regarding Federal Reserve/TPP/NSA(whistle blowers)/FBI&amp;CIA etc, we still have to see how he handles those issues and if it aligns with their wishes.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>School shootings are an interesting topic that should get more attention. Ive been looking into columbine, a lot of strangenesses connected to that one....the rabbit hole goes pretty deep. People died, but there were other shooters. Ambulances were not allowed near the school, victims were left unattended, the hospital workers all had to sign confidentiality agreements.... something stinks about the whole thing. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have read quite a lot about columbine too, the actual event is what bothers me but the build up to it seems pretty realistic if you ever read Klebold&#39;s diary. I mean the guy was deeply depressed and suffered from extreme anxiety rendering him suicidal for almost 3 YEARS before the event. That state of mind can really fuck with you and if you get it into your head that you are suffering because of bullies/class mates that don&#39;t understand you etc. Taking a bunch of them out before committing suicide is not hard to fathom.</p>

<p>I have seen the videos broadcasting from outside the school during the shooting and there are some strange occurrences indeed. I haven&#39;t read about the &quot;additional shooters&quot; theory, got any link?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My view on this....and I doubt you or most here will like it:</p>

<p>Trump is one of them. He is as pro-establishment as they get, but was playing an anti-establishment card to get elected. I doubt he&#39;ll even care enough to govern. Mike Pence, his VP, is probably going to be calling most of the shots, so it may be a situation similar to Bush/Cheney . 
And Mike Pence has pretty much the worst far right policies you can imagine. Just looking at him, to me, the guy looks even more evil than Hillary</p>

<p>Again, I could be wrong, but this is my perspective.</p>

<p>However, I do feel a lot of people have been (perhaps inadvertently) awoken by this election. People have, through Trump, begun realizing the true extent of the corruption and sickness of the elite. </p>

<p>I just hope people wake up even deeper than just seeing Clinton as the root of all evil (and understanding that she is just a head in the many-headed hydra) as well as see that only compassion, respect, understanding and cooperation, unity between all beings on this planet, will actually get us the Earth and the society we so dearly desire.</p>

<p>I wonder if he is actually going to do this. I guess time will tell. It&#39;s just that he has said so many contradicting things one can&#39;t help but think that everything he said up to now was just part of the plan to get him into office.</p>

<p>And I still feel like the elite would somehow prevent him from taking office if he was truly the man to enact real change for the better...</p>

<p>As I said, time will tell. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree with this sentiment wholeheartedly. I am a Liberal from MA (sharpen those pitchforks ladies and gentlemen) however I believe, along with many in this subreddit, that the election and its awful media coverage has been abominable.  I also believe that the corruption runs deep in the US and worldwide governments, however just because the liberal media was so anti-Trump and untruthful doesn&#39;t mean this subreddit has to devolve to partisan fingerpointing and flame wars. I hope that we can return to a place of open minded discussion, because I believe that this sub and America as a whole has the responsibility to think critically and independently without drawing party lines in the sand. And that is one of the reasons that I dig this subreddit. Keep it weird people! </p>

<p>I saw some really hard core chem trails today. Extra special. Lots of lines with rainbows. Strangely arcing and streaky clouds all over. Lots of crisscross action. Defiantly out of the ordinary for my area, not usually this active, is this way. Something was in the air today. Typical, I got no pics.</p>

<p>Still haven&#39;t seen a UFO. Friend and his dad totally saw one though.</p>

<p>I didn&#39;t spend hundreds of hours digging through wikileaks emails just to keep the Clinton Mafia out of office. I want them to go to prison. I want them to be held publicly accountable for their crimes. I&#39;d love to hear about UFOs and Chemtrails but I&#39;m going to keep dedicating my efforts to digging up the truth.</p>
