    <div class="md"><p>NEVER comply.  They absolutely do realize the power the citizens hold over them.  They constantly try to reinforce how powerless you all are, but it&#39;s purely a charade to keep you feeling impotent and afraid.  Their desperation is on full display.  The near endless FAKE false flags they&#39;ve been running for years, including ALL of the critical failures they made EVERY SINGLE TIME says far more than they ever could have hoped to with the amateur nonsense they pulled repeatedly.  Every single attempt to divide and conquer our minds has failed.  It only serves to further expose their plans to a far wider audience.  Far more eyes have been opened to the truth than they would ever admit, or allow their puppets to admit. They&#39;ve already lost and are in full damage control.</p>

<p>Again, never comply.  Never go willingly.  Never give up.  Always know that far more or your fellow man exist, are &quot;illuminated&quot; to these truths, and are just as ready to do whatever is necessary.  Whey they pull the &quot;look over there&quot; with ISIS or pretend aliens, know exactly what they are pulling.  They fully exposed their hand with Sandy Hook, Boston, Orlando, etc.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In 2011 and 2012 the Kochs were at the center of a new controversy over their role in funding the American Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC), an organization that disseminates corporate-written model legislation on a wide range of issues (such as paid sick leave) to state legislators.</p>

<p>In 1974 Koch was one of four oil companies accused by the Federal Energy Administration of overcharging customers by some $58 million. In 1980 Koch Industries was fined $50,000 by a federal court for manipulating a Bureau of Land Management lottery of oil and gas leases. That same year, the Carter Administration’s Council on Wage and Price Stability chastised Koch for refusing to cooperate with a price survey designed to assist a program to combat inflation (AP, March 7, 1980)</p>

<p>As part of his feud with his brothers, William Koch hired private investigators to document claims that Koch Industries had engaged in fraud while purchasing oil from Indian reservations. A Senate committee looked into the matter and in 1989 found some validity to the charges. It submitted its findings to the Department of Justice, but a grand jury declined to issue indictments. In 1999 a federal jury, acting in a whistleblower case that had been initiated by William Koch, found that Koch Industries had underreported the amount of oil it obtained from federal and Indian leases. In 2001 the company agreed to pay $25 million to settle the case.</p>

<p>In 1995 the U.S Justice Department, the Environmental Protection Agency and the United Stated Coast Guard fileda civil suit against Koch Industries and several of its affiliates for unlawfully discharging millions of gallons of oil into the waters of six states. In one of the largest Clean Water Act cased ever brought up to that time, the agencies accused Koch of being responsible for more than 300 separate spills in Alabama, Kansas, Louisiana, Missouri, Oklahoma and Texas. The largest incident occurred in Nueces Bay and Corpus Christi Bay in 1994 along the eastern coast of Texas.</p>

<p>Also in 1998, the National Transportation Safety Board found that the failure of a Koch subsidiary to protect a liquid butane pipeline from corrosion was responsible for a 1996 rupture that released a butane vapor. When a pickup truck drove into the vapor it ignited an explosion that killed the driver and a passenger. In a wrongful death lawsuit a Texas jury awarded the father of one of the victims $296 million in damages.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The list goes on and on and on.  They take in 575 million dollars in subsidies per year just in their petrochemical business ventures.  They are literally paid by the taxpayer to pollute, bribe, cheat, murder and steal.</p>

<p>Bribing and lying to government isnt that bad to me. Government should have NOTHING to do with business, then bribery would go away - taxes? Theyre libertarian minded and might think: fuck government - we know how to spend our money better --  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Libertarians, at least classical libertarians, would not take in 575+ million in subsidies per year from the same taxpayers they claim to be the best friend of.  It&#39;s absolutely insane to lobby for low or no taxes then take nearly a billion dollars worth of taxes as a subsidy to your highly profitable business, not to mention being extremely hypocritical.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/news/blood-and-oil/">http://www.cbsnews.com/news/blood-and-oil/</a></p>

<p>Whether you do or don&#39;t believe in government involvement in regulating things like clean water and air is immaterial, Koch Industries runs exceptionally unsafe and unprotected refineries and pipelines.  I worked for nearly 5 years on a contract as a Non-Destructive Testing technician doing ultrasonic thickness, magnetic particle, and radiographic testing of their pipes, vessels, exchangers, and boilers in one of their refineries.  A normal corrosive inhibition program, called a Risk Based Inspection (RBI) program, has each piece of equipment listed in a risk matrix made up of likelihood to corrode versus risk to equipment and manpower.  We routinely tested vital equipment to the profitability of the plant.  We did not routinely test secondary systems.  Strangely enough, the steam lines and condensate lines are secondary and also have the highest risk of corrosion and a significantly high risk to manpower.  But they have a low risk to impeding the refining process and thus a low risk to losing money if they rupture.  One of my co-workers was burnt in the arms and face when a condensate line with a hole through sprayed him while we were climbing a scaffold to inspect another line.  This was a fairly normal occurrence at this plant and many others in their network.  Our company did most of the on-site inspection as well as the turnaround inspection for all of their North American refineries, from Alaska to Texas.</p>

<p>The simple fact is they have ripped off their customers, their producers, the American taxpayer, and even their own workers and contractors, not to mention having two settlements for wrongful death in separate explosions.  Shrewd business is one thing; what they perpetrate is shameful, illegal, and un-American lack of regard for human life.  They lobby so hard for deregulation not because they feel so strongly about libertarianism, but because they feel so strongly about profit at any cost, including your life and your tax money, as evinced by their yearly subsidy money grabs.  Why do we as taxpayers need to add a half billion dollars in subsidies to an already very profitable business every year?  If they are truly dyed in the wool libertarians, let&#39;s see them act like it and stop taking my money while polluting my air and water and telling me how great their bribing Congress is.</p>
