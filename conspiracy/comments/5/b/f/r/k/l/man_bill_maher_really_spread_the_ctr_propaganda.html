        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>It was disgusting. His entire monologue was DNC talking points. &quot;Russia is trying to influence the election&quot;, &quot;Russia is faking documents&quot;, &quot;,Russia has compromised the FBI&quot;, &quot;why is the FBI not looking into Trump&quot;, &quot;Trump pays no taxes&quot;, etc</p>

<p>No different than the CTR bots and trolls, same exact talking points used the exact same way. I mean it&#39;s obvious all of these hosts push agendas, but this was just overly blatant.</p>

<p>Doesn&#39;t help that he also had Hopebama on to speak about his proposed Ministry of Truth. The pre-conditioning for this fuckery is real</p>

<p>He said &quot;I was wrong for criticizing Bush, Romney, McCain etc&quot;. (so now lying WMDs, torture programs, blocking legislation and all the progressive messages he has harped on don&#39;t matter?) He was basically graveling to his audience to convince them that trump is the anti-christ. </p>

<p>It was pretty crazy to see him go back on the years of arguments he has been making. He seemed desperate. And it was not persuasive.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Its what they know/understand. Vast majority still think that your major sporting events are 100% legitimate events instead of the glorified sports entertainment they are. Extremely difficult pill to swallow, especially if you&#39;re a life long sports fan who put all your energy into it. Turns out people aren&#39;t interesting in breaking the illusion and would rather violently lash out then face reality.  Even considering that NFL/NBA/NFL/FIFA are illegitimate organizations closer to circus shows then competitive events is enough to brand you as a heretic.  But this is exactly why America can do a Clinton v Trump election and people buy it like its legitimate. They don&#39;t know legitimacy at all, its all a glorified Truman show. </p>

<p>If you&#39;re one of the types who get offended by what I&#39;ve written (speaking generally here, not directly to you) really take a look at underground gambling. Only reason its illegal is that if it was legal it would require league oversight to fixed games. You can still gamble fairly easily, but its very shady. Tennis alone is filled with people fixing their own games because its the only way to make money off playing tennis if you&#39;re not in the top 20. </p>

<p>Edit: Now that i&#39;m back off mobile, for example game 3 Hendricks vs. Tomlin the commentators ran a strike-zone analysis and found 16 favorable calls to the Cubs and none to the Indians. The Cubs however were shit and the Indians won 1-0.</p>

<p>With regards to basketball, look to the constant controversy regarding Draymond Green&#39;s actions and the suspensions/lack thereof. </p>

<p>The stupid people eating it up</p>

<p>I see this on the internet and on tv a lot, (and maybe I just live in a place without &#39;stupid people&#39;) but irl, I don&#39;t know anyone who is eating it up. In fact everyone seems to see right through it. I can&#39;t help but think its just propaganda meant to make everyone feel like they&#39;re the only one who sees it.</p>

I say this because the day after the MSM news announced Bernie proposed a bill to federally decriminalize pot, Maher had nothing at all to say about this very big news. </p>

<p>Keep in mind, his show is live, so there would be no way he could miss this info.  He straightup ignored it.  So his endorsement of Hillary trumps his endorsement for pot, which means he&#39;s a pot hangout or a shill.... maybe both </p>

<p>OR maybe he knew the game was rigged for Hillary so there wasn&#39;t a chance bernies shit would go thru</p>

<p>Last week NBC had a story about &quot;cyber hacking&quot; and fake data dumps they expect to see coming. NBC is about as deep into bed with the DNC as CNN is, so I think NBC may have overplayed the strategy with that one.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think a combination of him getting worse, but also you becoming more awake. Me personally I didn&#39;t realize how brainwashed I was by &quot;liberal media&quot; until I saw the treatment Bernie got, and realized they used the same tricks on him they&#39;ve done forever, but I ignored because I viewed them as my &quot;default&quot; representatives. Now seeing a criminal investigation written-off as nothing because &quot;sexism&quot; when my candidate of choice is Jill Stein made me realize how the &quot;Isms&quot; are weaponized and used to discredit, something I&#39;ve done to many conservatives in the past but I felt I was in the right in doing.</p>
