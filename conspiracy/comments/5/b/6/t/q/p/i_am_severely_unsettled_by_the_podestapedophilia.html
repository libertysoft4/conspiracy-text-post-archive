To see concrete evidence of such an abhorrent conspiracy is probably the worst thing I came across (used to be the North Korean modern concentration camps but even that is from unreliable provenance and tinged with Western propaganda.)</p>

<p>The worst thing is that I can&#39;t even discuss this with my friends and family without sounding cuckoo. The way the mainstream media is so blatantly ignoring this (because they&#39;re in on it) makes me feel like I&#39;m in an alternate universe.</p>

<p>Just need some confirmation that I&#39;m not going crazy.</p>

<p>No,  you are not crazy.    The Podesta thing needs more investigation.    But it looks like people want to think the Catholic sex abuse scandal was unique and want to bury all of this.</p>

<p>So,  I am surprised this is &quot;new&quot; to you.   Most people have had plenty of time to either bury it or assimilate it.   Its not easy to assimilate the denial though.</p>

<p>The dude is talking about pizza and pasta. Maybe out of context it COULD be construed as nefarious, but in context it&#39;s completely benign.</p>

<p>You just talked about sticking to facts of corruption (I agree!), and in the very next sentence recommended showing people this benign communication, as if it&#39;s OBVIOUSLY sinister and anyone can see that. No, it&#39;s not. There&#39;s enough real shit to get up in arms about....take your own advice and stick to the facts.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, you would have thought that the South Korean government being run by a cult was a joke, and yet it appears to be true. You know that Weiner and Huma are in for some serious shit, with ties to pedophilia. We heard that there is a &quot;shadow government&quot;, and then you wonder once more: wtf was that speech Comey gave about recommending no charges? We know that podesta is a nutjob and shows great interest in cults, but that is it. The rest is speculative. If you send tens of thousands of emails over years, some of them will be about pizza parties. When he gets busted and they find evidence, then we can go nuts over it, for now there&#39;s not enough evidence, just some weird connections.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Okay, I do have to agree with the fact that it isn&#39;t concrete evidence, and these all may be innocent comments about food.  I do feel that some of the things said do warrant a discussion, even if they are innocent. For example: &quot;Hi John, The realtor found a handkerchief (I think it has a map that seems pizza-related. Is it yours?&quot; Either he had a map to Little Caesar&#39;s on a snot rag or something&#39;s up.</p>
