    <div class="md"><p>I am returning to jesus because of this. I don&#39;t believe and have no faith but our government is a satanist pedocult. Like, really? I was driving and Jay-Z (involved with spirit cooking lady) comes on the radio and I switch stations, then it&#39;s Katy Perry(said she sold her soul to get fame) and she is singing some SJW bullshit and I change that station. Then an ad comes on telling me to get out the vote on iheartradio. Turns out after some digging that company is a backer of Clinton. I just said fuck it and found some Jesus music. This is all so fucked. I am probably wrong and there probably is a God. I guess I was brainwashed into thinking there is no God. I&#39;m just going to assume I am wrong for a while and even if I ain&#39;t and there is no god it&#39;s still better than being influenced by them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Catholicism is not christianity...read the bible..catholism is pagan rituals mixed with elements of christianity...which means its not christianity.</p>

<p>Rome was losing followers of paganism when christianity came along....so they converted worshipping multiple gods for everything ( like the god of water, the god of love, the god of fire) to calling them saint....and catholocism was born.  Now its the saint of water..patron saint of fire..etc.   Also they continued the worship of samiramus (nimrods wife from the tower of babel) and made samiramus into mary....who was not immortal or special...a normal sinner that God used to fulfill scriptures.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It makes no sense if you want to be a Christian to go to Catholic service.  </p>

<p>Better read your bible ( at least the gospels and the nt) and read acts and find a church that is non denomenational and look like acts.  If you cant find one nearby i can share you great sermons online till u find one.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The Greek Orthodox Church (aka early Catholic Church) compiled and canonized the first Bible in the first place. They literally picked and chose which books would make it in the Bible. Catholicism and Greek Orthodoxy were the only forms of Christianity up until the 1600s, nothing Christian existed outside those churches until Protestant reformation which was only a couple hundred years ago. The &quot;Bible Believing&quot; movement makes no sense because you are using a book to condemn the people who made it. You are basically implying that for the first 1500 years of Christianity they were all doing it wrong! Which contradicts the prophecies in the book of revelations that foretells the church falling further and further away from God. Makes no sense. The non denominational church movement didn&#39;t even exist till the 1800s! After the Protestant reformation Christianity in all forms was still steeped in rituals and catholic traditions (formal confession of sins thru a priest in order to be forgiven, praying to Mary) for a long time.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thank you, I was aware of catholic roots in paganism. I was born a catholic and now choose to follow this religion for exactly that reason.</p>

<p>To give a criminally small summary of the two - Christianity is a belief in a benevolent God. Paganism is the worshipping of nature. </p>

<p>Those are two messages I believe in and will gladly use as values to guide my life. I do believe that God and nature are intermingled.</p>

<p>Do you have any research you could point me to that would show when Occultism started separating into factions? Or is Occultism a faction of something bigger? </p>

For 2000 years the Bible has talked about a one world government and it would be headed by an antichrist who is under Satan&#39;s control. Talks about a cashless society with the mark of the beast,  but the worst part is that it talks about a tribulation period after the church is raptured out.

    <div class="md"><p>Please dont get angry at flat earthers.</p>

<p>Long ago i found flat earth society website and went looking around. They had a chat feature so i started chatting. I went in assuming i would teach them something but instead i was faced with a lot of inconvenient facts and  unanswerable questions.</p>

<p>Instead of getting mad at a flat earther, just change it around and ask yourself, why do some people believe the earth is flat? Try to find and understand the underlying model that flat earthers think upon. </p>

<p>Basically to understand a flat earther, you have to become a flat earther, and by that i mean that you have to have a robust, working model in your mind, similar to how you conceptualize a ball earth, solar system, milky way galaxy.</p>

<p>This is not to say you have to remain a flat earther. I can go between the two models at will and argue from either side of the debate.</p>

<p>To me, it is important to be able to conceptualize alternative models. For example we are all taught the Bohr model of the atom, even though later they admit the Bohr model is wrong but they teach it anyway because kids are too stupid to understand the correct model, whatever that is.</p>

<p>To me, learning to think in both models is as important as learning to add as well as subtract, learning to multiply as well as divide. </p>

<p>The two models are different sides of the same coin, so to speak. You are missing out on a mind-blowing experience to have these two conflicting modelscco-exist within your mind. </p>

<p>Just youtube flat earth and start watching videos. Theres endless content. Dont seek to debunk flat earth, instead seek to understand flat earth, and thereby also understand flat earthers. </p>

<p>I spend a lot of time learning a lot of interesting things online,  and id say flat earth was worth my time and is worth your time. </p>

And considering they control the modern world it doesn&#39;t matter whether you believe it or not, because of their actions in service of it affect your life.  And considering these are the richest and most powerful people on the planet and yet they still believe in this crazy shit, you could probably infer that they might know something we don&#39;t.  Despite the fact that we live in a three-dimensional world there are things that go on beyond our sight and comprehension on the spiritual plane that we don&#39;t understand.  That&#39;s why individuals like these people thirst and are obsessed with &quot;secret&quot; knowledge, that&#39;s why they go into secret societies.

Jesus body was never found and historically he appeared to his followers and up to 500 after his death...meaning he resurrected and was God.

<p>I ask them, do you see a lot of churches around?</p>

<p>They reply yes.</p>

<p>I ask, do you think some of the people in those churches are sincere?</p>

<p>They reply yes.</p>

<p>I ask, do you think some people practice Satanism?</p>

<p>They reply yes.</p>

<p>I ask, do you think some of those people are sincere?</p>

<p>They reply yes.</p>

<p>So, what im saying is that just because you dont take Satanism seriously doesnt mean Satanists dont take Satanism seriously.</p>

<p>Just because you are an atheist doesn&#39;t mean Satanists dont exist. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I love how words get hijacked. Fine. I mean gender as the sexual classification of male and female. In humans, XX=Female XY=Male. Two becoming one (sexual reproduction) in flesh to create life. </p>

<p>There are rare (very rare. Like almost never happening and if so they are sterile so they can&#39;t reproduce) exceptions in nature. No matter who cooks the food in whatever culture, the man is the father and the woman wants a good man to be the father and take care of his kids. </p>

<p>Satanists/Illuminati/powerhungry-idiots want all good to be confused or hidden or outright demonized (you got married then had kids? How archaic!) so there bullshit can be pushed on weak minded ignorant people. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think I must be an autist because I haven&#39;t felt <em>any</em> of those emotions except for maybe anticipation.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve been in this since, oh, 2006?  I mean I got angry when I saw the videos of the riots in Toronto for the G20 event a few years back, and how that one cop said &quot;You have no rights&quot;.  Yeah, that made me see red.  Thankfully he got reprimanded.</p>

<p>But really, that&#39;s been my emotional high during my time as a &quot;truther&quot;, conspiracy nutter, whatever.  So now I don&#39;t keep up with police abuse and brutality because I get uncontrollably angry.  Everything else?  I pretty much <em>expect</em> it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Of course the label &quot;Conspiracy Theorist&quot; was coined by the CIA to shed discredability on anything said that might prove the &quot;Elite&quot; are into suspect situations.  So the &quot;Theorists&quot; aren&#39;t necessarily coming from left field as they would like the masses to believe. That is just a psyop to lump together accusations that they do not wish to answer to.  Since FOIA and the Internet have proven so many times that there are devious motives and cover-ups involving so many recognizable politicians, businessmen, and so called &quot;Elites&quot;, the issue becomes informing the public without sounding &quot;too crazy&quot;. Even though the evidence largely can be found easily, it is not easy to sell truth to those who wish to think our &quot;higher-ups and power-players&quot; would never be involved in such filth. Unfortunately, they are. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>There&#39;s nothing in the Bible that condones pedophilia as being sanctioned by God, guaranteed. However the stories told in the Bible are all about humans with various flaws, who sometimes obey God and sometimes do not. So if one of them (or all of them) happened to practice this or that behavior, it doesn&#39;t automatically mean it&#39;s a reflection of God&#39;s rules.</p>

<p>As far as the clergy goes, the Roman Catholic Church is control grid. The Roman state made every effort to extinguish Christianity and failed, and after enough failure, took another approach, which was to co-opt Christianity and call itself the church. That&#39;s the story of the Roman Catholic Church, the same guys who sanctioned things like the Inquisition and the Crusades</p>
