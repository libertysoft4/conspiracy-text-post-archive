<p>There are four emails that have been released referencing &quot;expenses&quot; for the Waverly group. All this is back in 2008. But they seem to still be in operation as of 2016 if you google the various names and locations you find as you go.</p>

<p>Current site: <a href="http://archive.is/2016.11.04-175947/http://www.waverlygroup.com/">http://archive.is/2016.11.04-175947/http://www.waverlygroup.com/</a></p>

<p>Archived site from March this year: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160308222626/http://waverlygroup.com/">https://web.archive.org/web/20160308222626/http://waverlygroup.com/</a></p>

<p><a href="https://i.sli.mg/iRlnLx.png">Everyone that works for the company</a> is listed as having top secret security clearances and everyone appears to have extensive military backgrounds but is working for some vague business consulting that seems like a transparent front for arranging shady deals between defense contractors and the Clinton campaign and CGI and CF.</p>

<p>There also seems to be a relationship between the people running that business and <a href="http://articles.baltimoresun.com/2002-09-16/news/0209160169_1_columbia-restaurant-albert-open-the-restaurant">the local franchise</a> of the restaurant &quot;Eggspectation&quot; <a href="http://eggspectation.com/history/">http://eggspectation.com/history/</a> which does business in Qatar, India, and Dubai, and has private business areas separate from the main dining area.</p>

<p>All of this is easily searchable on google and evident from the wikileaks excerpts and they have clearly been doing brisk business for the last eight years but as far as I can tell I&#39;m the first person calling it out on the internet as a shell company for something.</p>

<p>Can anyone help confirm any of this is as shady as it looks? Has anyone heard theories about this group before?</p>
