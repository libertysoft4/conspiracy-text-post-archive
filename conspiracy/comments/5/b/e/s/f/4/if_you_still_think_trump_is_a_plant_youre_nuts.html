    <div class="md"><p>Are you aware trump was prochoice and for universal health care when he was a democrat before 2010 ? 
In 2009 he donated to the Clinton foundation upwards of 101k. In 2007 he donated to her campaign and spoke extremely highly of her saying she was a great women.
In 1999 the Clinton and gore administration was interested in trump running third party. And a week before trump announced running bill Clinton called Donald trump right after hillary clinton announced she was running, and it was said bill Clinton was upbeat and encouraging trump to run.
Chelsea Clinton and Ivanka trump are best friends and both trump and Clinton have business addresses in the same building for tax evasion. Plus the hundreds of photos they have of them at fundraisers and some that the national archives are not releasing even though there is a foia request.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No one is nuts for being skeptical, especially in today&#39;s climate. </p>

<p>Trump may very well be for the people, and I certainly hope he is, but that&#39;s also the exact type of mentality and fervent support TPTB have manipulated entire countries into many times before. </p>

<p>Trump, to his credit, does seem to be exposing certain things that if I were TPTB, I wouldn&#39;t want him saying, but maybe that&#39;s their tactic? Get the person we all know is corrupt indicted and put an anti establishment &quot;savior&quot; esque person in their place to give the population the illusion of a victory? Wouldn&#39;t be the first time methods like that were used. </p>

<p>Anyway, like I said, I hope he&#39;s legit. But part of me also thinks it&#39;s impossible to be this high up and influential and still be legit, given how powerful TPTB has proven time and time again to be. I&#39;m certainly hopeful, and MUCH prefer Trump over Hillary, but will remain cautious either way. </p>

<p>Or they could have done it more subtle &quot;here Donald files on a bunch of potential running mates if you want info on anyone let me know&quot; </p>

<p>Or did Trump find Pence on his own?
or do they have History?</p>

<p>Maybe Trump and Pence are the Relegious Plants. Its all a game just have to figure out the players.
I mean Trump in his speech announcing Mike Pence had a long tangent on relegion meniong a Lyndon B Johnson ruling hed change. Tax Exempt status...etc</p>

<p>But watching him talk. I feel like he legit just studied everyone and based it on who he thinks was best for the job. I guess Indiana must have done really good as a state can any americans verify the status of Indiana right now comparative to other states? Edit: nevermind trump just started talking about what he did.</p>

<p>I def know why he picked Pence. Pence pretty much achieved Donalds Platform. Cut taxes, Create Jobs, Balance the Budget. Invest in Education, Infastructure, Veterans...etc Pence impressive achievements</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have the same feeling. Either HRC or Trump&#39;s vp will take control and somehow be worse than anyone could have imagined the candidates them self could have been. I have a suspicion Pence or Kaine is ultra nationalist and will bring fascism or neo-fascism full swing in this country.</p>

<p>Theory # 1,032,293a hes the Pedo ring leader thats how he was picked by Hillary blackmail. He is a Aryan Brother who leaked all the DNC info to Wikileaks thats why you dont see him in too many Emails even though hes the fucking VP. Because hes protecting his own ass.</p>
