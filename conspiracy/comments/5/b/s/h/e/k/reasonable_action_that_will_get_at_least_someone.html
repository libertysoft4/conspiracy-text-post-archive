        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Idk what the rules are for drilling your basement in a restaurant or what permits you have to ask for but wouldn&#39;t a simple call to the health department asking them to check the place for fucking tunnels underground?  If someone called my old work and said someone was smoking we would have health department there the next day to check.  Speaking of health department has anyone checked possible ties they might have there?  </p>

<p>Was just some thoughts i had,  thanks</p>

<p>Grew up in Belgium with the Dutroux case and An&#39;s Uncle was my teacher. 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marc_Dutroux">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marc_Dutroux</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>A number of shortcomings in the Dutroux investigation caused widespread discontent in Belgium with the country&#39;s criminal justice system, and the ensuing scandal was one of the reasons for the reorganisation of Belgium&#39;s law enforcement agencies.</p>

<p>Allegations of cover-up[edit]
There was widespread anger and frustration among Belgians due to police errors, the general slowness of the investigation and the disastrous outcome of the events. This suspicion that Dutroux had been, or was being, protected was raised when the public became aware of Dutroux&#39;s claims that he was part of a sex ring that included high-ranking members of the police force and government.[14] This suspicion, along with general anger over the outcome, culminated with the popular judge in charge of investigating the claims, Jean-Marc Connerotte (fr), being dismissed on the grounds of having participated in a fund-raising dinner for the girls&#39; parents.[14] The investigation itself was wrapped up on the grounds of conflict of interest. His dismissal and the end of the investigation resulted in a massive protest march (the &quot;White March&quot;) of 300,000 people on the capital, Brussels, in October 1996, two months after Dutroux&#39;s arrest, in which demands were made for reforms of Belgium&#39;s police and justice system.[15]
<strong>On the witness stand, Jean-Marc Connerotte (fr), the original judge of the case, broke down in tears when he described &quot;the bullet-proof vehicles and armed guards needed to protect him against the shadowy figures determined to stop the full truth coming out.[14] Never before in Belgium has an investigating judge at the service of the king been subjected to such pressure. We were told by police that [murder] contracts had been taken out against the magistrates.&quot; Connerotte testified that the investigation was seriously hampered by protection of suspects by people in the government. &quot;Rarely has so much energy been spent opposing an inquiry,&quot; he said. He believed that the Mafia had taken control of the case.[16]</strong></p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think the FBI, or a faction within the FBI, is trying to reach out to online communities asking them to submit actionable tips relating to Alefantis, and company.
On 11/6 they tweeted a link to ongoing kidnapping investigations seemingly outta nowhere, but at the same time as #PedoGate/ #PizzaGate was picking up steam:

<p>Here is my comment from a different thread complete with image comparison links in edit 4:</p>

<p>Lisa Irwin bears a strong resemblance: <a href="https://archive.fo/YJJnJ">https://archive.fo/YJJnJ</a></p>

<p>She even has blue eyes, and blonde hair.</p>

<p>That image was posted on Instagram 126 weeks ago.
Baby went missing in 2011, and was born 11/11/10. 
This was posted around 2.5 years ago when Lisa Irwin would have been 3 and a half. </p>

<p>They want us to give them a reason to get in there, and go after Alefantis.</p>

<p>Contact the FBI with a tip. 
Instagram acct @JimmyComet, real name James Alefantis. Runs pizza place Comet Ping Pong: <a href="http://www.cometpingpong.com">http://www.cometpingpong.com</a></p>

<p>Good post on his associates:

<p>Edit: More on Lisa Irwin &#39;s kidnapping, perp may have been paid to commit the kidnapping: <a href="http://www.foxnews.com/transcript/2015/01/05/look-back-at-baby-lisa-mystery/">http://www.foxnews.com/transcript/2015/01/05/look-back-at-baby-lisa-mystery/</a></p>

<p>Edit 2: There are signs that indicate Comet Ping Pong&#39;s website is run from European server (would need to check the pol thread)..... and this happened shortly after the kidnapping: <a href="http://www.today.com/id/47502881/ns/today-today_news/t/missing-baby-lisa-debit-card-fraud-clue/#.WCGKcS0rLDc">http://www.today.com/id/47502881/ns/today-today_news/t/missing-baby-lisa-debit-card-fraud-clue/#.WCGKcS0rLDc</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>Couldn&#39;t you just tip off OSHA that they&#39;ve got unsafe freezer door locks or electrical run without conduit? OSHA doesn&#39;t fuck around and they come in unannounced. Or maybe a fire marshal to check occupancy because &#39;some of the doors won&#39;t open&#39;, forcing them to open all the secret ones. I dunno. </p>
