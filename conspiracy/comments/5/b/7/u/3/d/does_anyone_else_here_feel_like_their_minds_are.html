<p>But Im having a hard time wrapping my mind around all we&#39;ve witnessed as a result of Wikileaks and especially the last couple weeks.  </p>

<p>Its everything every conspiracy theorist has said ever, and more.  A confirmation of every single fucking one of them.  </p>

<p>How the fuck is this all possible?  </p>

<p>I was deep into conspiracies before, but this is like how the fuck do we integrate this into our world views?  </p>

<p>The elites are as sick as we all imagined and 100 times worse.  </p>

<p>How can we even understand all this?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>People who want to abuse others seek positions where they will be able to do so.  Anyone who grew up trapped in religion, especially on the mission field, would recognize all of this.  It is painful and intensely sad, but familiar.  Mission kids are very, very often abused by the same mission people left in control of them and no matter how blatant the abuse is, no one will openly acknowledge the abuse exists.  They want to cling to the illusion that &quot;god&quot; exists and protects them so they refuse to see the abuse happening to their own children.  In this case, it is the entire country refusing to see what is clearly corruption and abuse.  Hillary will likely win and get away with all this because too many people will chose to ignore it.  Too many people lack the courage to face it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Can you imagine how Assange must feel? The guy knows the contents of his own dead man&#39;s switch, which he states could lead to WWIII (and I believe it). </p>

<p>The elites&#39; view of reality is so radically different than our comprehension of it. I like to think a conspiracy theorist&#39;s interpretation is closer to it than most, but it has indeed been a wild ride. </p>

<p>I feel so fortunate to be sitting front row to a show that so few people get to watch. On the other hand I&#39;m somewhat looking forward to the election being finished so I can return to my own truth.</p>

<p>If there&#39;s one thing I&#39;m also seeing, it&#39;s the sheer misery of people in this field. The documentary &quot;Weiner&quot; is worth watching because it gives an inside glimpse into the life of a politician and his wife, Huma Abedin. It&#39;s a comedy, but a very dark one. I&#39;ve noticed the miserable energy when I went to school in DC. This game takes a serious toll on people, and there&#39;s only so much energy that a person should lend to this. </p>

<p>I&#39;m only half joking when I say that I&#39;ll need a good bath and a meditation retreat the day after the election.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>We should bare in mind that much of what these douches in power perpetrate is a little on the plain as day side.   But since they own nearly every major media outlet, the chatter about how fucking obvious it is gets seriously dampened if not totally suppressed. </p>

<p>Personally, I&#39;ve found it to be very confirmational.  And it reassures my thought process around these things.   It gives weight and credibility to this sub.</p>

<p>Don&#39;t think the RNC doesn&#39;t do this very same shit btw.   They just didn&#39;t get their shit hacked/leaked.</p>

<p>And none of my friends even know or take the time to research..&amp; just how much this is impacting us.. i just typed a message trying to explain what the fuck is happening then just deleted it all because I feel nutty omg</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not that mindfucked tbh. It&#39;s pretty much what I expected from a modern politician. If anything, I&#39;m surprised there isn&#39;t much damning to come out of it. We&#39;ve had an incredibly unprecedented look behind the scenes of a presidential candidate, and there really isn&#39;t much that bothers me next to minor things (debate question leak, for example). Every other so-called &quot;bombshell&quot; has had pretty reasonable explanations within context. </p>

<p>Like, this is supposedly the epitome of corruption, and while I do think she is corrupt either by intention or associations, this is all we can find? After countless leaks and investigations? If anything it&#39;s made me think she&#39;s not that bad.</p>
