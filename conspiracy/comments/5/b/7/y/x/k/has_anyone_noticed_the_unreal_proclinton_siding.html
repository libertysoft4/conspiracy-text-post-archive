    <div class="md"><p>Ok.  Let me break this down for you.</p>

<p>First off, I am not a Hillary supporter.  I didn&#39;t vote for her.</p>

<p>Donald Trump isn&#39;t an elite?  He&#39;s a billionaire.  If he wins, the elites will continue to get away with awful things, just different things than the ones that Hillary has gotten away with.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t think you&#39;re crazy for worrying about it.  I don&#39;t think the Democrats think so, either.  They were asking for the emails to be released, and I think that request was genuine.  </p>

<p>There was a lot of collusion in the DNC to get Hillary elected.  This doesn&#39;t necessarily reflect on the government.  The DNC is corrupt as shit, but they&#39;re a separate entity, and will continue to run things however they want unless they&#39;re put under a microscope.  I think they should be completely overhauled, but in a way that makes sure people who play fair will be put in their place.  I think that&#39;s very important.</p>

<p>To make it about Red vs Blue is stupid, nothing is ever going to change if these parties continue to get the majority of the votes.  They will expect that the next election will be the same, and will put up a corrupt-as-shit candidate knowing that the other party will do the same.  </p>

<p>Don&#39;t get sucked in to the us vs them narrative, and downvote me for stating facts.  Both candidates suck ass, and anyone who thinks that theirs is good just because the other is worse is just fooling themselves.  If Hillary gets elected, I will be among the first to line up outside the White House pressing for her impeachment.  If Trump wins, I&#39;ll just move.</p>

He&#39;s the only opportunity for substantial change we have ever received. Every candidate is a gamble. We don&#39;t know what to expect, but with Hillary we have a pretty good idea with her extensive political record. Plus, she&#39;s being investigated by the FBI! She can potentially be charged with TREASON, yet some people still think she&#39;s good for our country. That is mind-numbingly stupid.

</blockquote>

<p>Deleting emails and pleading the fifth?  You think that&#39;s third-world level?</p>

<p>I&#39;d be much more inclined to believe that the slanderous tactics of the Trump campaign, paired with the calls to <strong>jail his political opponents</strong> might make you think of third world countries a little more.  I mean, that&#39;s military dictator 101.</p>

<p>Not to mention the calls on his side to limit freedoms of the press, slanderous speech, and internet rights, as well as the &quot;stop and frisk, then take the guns away from the bad guys&quot;, personal attacks against critics, speech of &quot;being able to get away with anything&quot;, shooting someone in the street, and taking liberties with women.  </p>

<p>Those might make you think of a despot, or Kim Jong-un type figure.</p>

<p>edit - Plus, if you really think he&#39;s the only anti-establishment candidate we&#39;ve ever had, you&#39;re a freaking lunatic or you turned 18 this election cycle.  He isn&#39;t even really anti-establishment, he loves anyone who supports him, and he&#39;ll be thoroughly pro-establishment as soon as he&#39;s a part of it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Okay, <em>first-world</em> dictatorship... Is that better? Not many of those around.</p>

<p>Trump isn&#39;t the only one calling for Clinton to be imprisoned. Hell, he wasn&#39;t even the first person to say it... But most importantly, she actually does deserve to be imprisoned, or at the very least disqualified from taking office. He&#39;d resemble a dictator if such a call for an imprisonment were unjust, but she has certainly broken the law and most definitely lied under oath. And anyways, saying she&#39;d be in jail if he were president was just a snappy comeback during the debate. What he actually threatened her with was the announcement that if he is to be elected, he is going to appoint a special investigative team to look into her emails.</p>

<p>Limit freedom of the press? With the exception of Fox News and a few small conservative outlets, Clinton essentially <em>owns</em> the press. Not only are they blatantly anti-Trump, but they won&#39;t report on most of Clinton&#39;s wrongdoings, and those that they do mention, they try to portray as baseless and silly. A nation in which guns are banned and the media is controlled by the government, is very similar to a dictatorship. North Korea, for example, has those same characteristics. Trump recognizes that the media is already largely controlled by a single party, and wants to change that by basically saying, &quot;play fair or don&#39;t play at all.&quot;</p>

<p>As for limiting slanderous speech, the left (Clinton) are already censoring those who oppose them. Have you been on <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a> lately? Post something negative about Clinton and see what happens. Facebook is censoring right-wing news sources. Twitter is removing anti-Hillary hashtags. YouTube is limiting the view count on anti-Hillary videos. The amount of censorship and propaganda we&#39;ve seen this election cycle is unbelievable, and it&#39;s not coming from Trump&#39;s side. If she has this much power as a <em>candidate</em>, just imagine what she could do as president.</p>

<p>Stop and Frisk is essentially profiling. In other words, somebody looks suspicious, so they are treated accordingly. People don&#39;t like the sound of it, but it&#39;s useful. Appearance says a lot about a person. Also, how they act, how they talk, what they say, what they listen to, who they hang out with, etc. If somebody looks like trouble, is it really better to wait until they commit a crime and then later on say, &quot;Ya know, I had a feeling he&#39;d do something like that&quot;? If somebody who is stopped and frisked has done nothing incriminating, then they have nothing to worry about. Now, can this method be abused? Yes, as can just about anything, in one way or another. </p>

<p>Personal attacks against critics... Well, uh... Yeah. Most of them are fucking assholes. I&#39;ve lost so much respect for so many different people this election who are critical of Trump, and it&#39;s often because they&#39;re either hypocrites, liars, or propagandists. They call Trump a bully and then proceed to make fun of his appearance or his supporters. Hillary herself called us &quot;deplorable.&quot; Real unifying words there, huh? </p>

<p>Trump is (or was) a womanizer. Did anyone actually think otherwise. He even publicly confessed in an interview years ago (with Howard Stern, I think) to having committed adultery in the past. After that bus tape came out, he stated, &quot;I never claimed to be a perfect person.&quot; Think about this for a second... Trump openly confessed to having committed adultery in the past, where as Bill Clinton lied to the American people (numerous times) about his affairs, and was subsequently impeached. Hillary Clinton chose to stay married to Bill, the serial adulterer, yet still attempts to shame Trump. Either way, an adulterer is going to be in the White House. I mean, people like JFK, and he was probably a worse adulterer than both Bill and Trump... Well, maybe not Bill.</p>

<p>As for me being a lunatic, I&#39;m not the one pretending to be some sort of psychic. If he were pro-establishment, he&#39;d have more support from his own party.</p>

<p>Dude, you basically agreed with me on at least 3 out of 4 points.  I already said, you didn&#39;t give a counter argument, just stated that the other side has done worse.  That&#39;s not an argument, and I&#39;m not even voting for the dems.  You&#39;re arguing with a different person.</p>

<p>Wake the fuck up is starting to sound really ironic.</p>

<p>Stop and frisk is not constitutional, so even though you have deemed it useful, though you are a great and wise leader, it&#39;s not legal.  It&#39;s like waterboarding, it might get useful results sometimes, but it&#39;s not worth the loss of rights.  I&#39;ll never agree with it, so next &quot;point&quot;.</p>

<p>Womanizing argument is against Bill, so though it&#39;s kinda funny that you&#39;re reaching that far, still not applicable in my case.  Next... (yawn)</p>

<p>lmao.  Hyperbole much?  Does he have an anti-establishment running mate?  So, the ticket is at least 1/2 establishment.  LOL you&#39;re an idiot.</p>

<p>I&#39;m on <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a> all the time.  Mostly posting anti-Hillary stuff.  I&#39;ve never gotten banned, because mostly I bash her actual policies instead of making ad-hominem insults.  I would insult Donald&#39;s, but he doesn&#39;t have any besides a wall and immigration policy that he&#39;s not really sure about, deportation squads that would cost fucking enormous amounts of taxpayer money, public works (yes, that&#39;s helpful, and specific.  Great words, Donald.  And very conservative, almost FDR conservative), and ISIS is bad.</p>

<p>I could do this all day.  Honestly, he&#39;s the easiest fucking person to insult in the world.  Except for the people who support him, they have to be fucking braindead, paid, or huge trolls to actually believe the guy.  Clinton is godawful, but I guess there is actually someone in the world who can make her look like a genius.</p>

<p>Just so you know, I&#39;m smiling intensely at your anguish right now, and will celebrate your personal feeling of loss when he loses.</p>

<p>Shit for brains.  Lol.  You must be like over 40, too.  You should be ashamed, have you no sense?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Stop and frisk absolutely <em>IS</em> constitutional as is proven by the 8-1 vote from <em>Terry v. Ohio</em> in 1968. Hillary Clinton and Lester Holt, the second debate moderator, were both incorrect in their statements that it is unconstitutional. Stop and Frisk is known as a &quot;Terry Stop&quot; within the law enforcement community.</p>

<p>The womanizing argument is not solely against Bill. Hillary has been attacking Trump&#39;s womanizing past while simultaneously choosing to remain married to a womanizer herself. In other words, she&#39;s being a hypocrite by acting like his past actions are unforgivable.  </p>

<p>Pence is a politician, sure... But he seems to be more of a strategic addition than anything. Two non-politicians on one ticket would have likely resulted in even less support from the GOP than they are already receiving.</p>

<p>I&#39;d like some links to your anti-Hillary posts on <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a> (actually, I might look myself and report back to you).</p>

<p>Trump has more policies than you give him credit for. I assume you probably don&#39;t look too in depth to them though, considering you&#39;ve already made up your mind about him. How about his plan to impose congressional term limits? A move that would certainly help prevent the continuation of government corruption and idleness. </p>

<p>You say Donald&#39;s supporters must be paid, but Clinton has CTR, and recently, popular YouTubers have been coming out saying that the Clinton campaign offered them money to make pro-Hillary/anti-Trump statements in their videos. There is also video evidence that the Clinton campaign has paid homeless and mentally unstable people to incite violence at Trump rallies, and more video evidence in which the Clinton campaign is offering $300 rebates to  people living in halfway houses if they vote for Clinton, and if that&#39;s not disgusting enough, they claim that they will only receive the money if Clinton wins. Also, there is actual financial record of the Clinton campaign paying protestors. </p>

<p>You say you&#39;re not for Hillary, but you are certainly leaning her way. If you&#39;re not for her, then who are you for? </p>

<p>You&#39;re smiling &quot;intensely at my anguish&quot;? Jesus. You don&#39;t have a boner too, do you? </p>

<p>I love that you address my insults, and then try to counter them with an insult of your own... Followed by desperate attempts to convince me that you are smarter than I am by following your comments up with &quot;lol.&quot; Am I supposed to believe that you&#39;re so intellectually superior to me that my &quot;ignorance&quot; is literally making you laugh? And how arrogant does somebody have to be to type out the word &quot;yawn?&quot; Also, how&#39;d you go from thinking I was 18 to thinking I&#39;m 40? </p>

<p>I agree. I&#39;m sure some people might try but not nearly as many people who say they&#39;re going to.</p>

<p>Same stuff happened during Bush&#39;s 2nd term election against Kerry. I had so many friends saying they were going to move to Canada if Bush won, and not 1 of them actually did.</p>

<p>Same thing probably happened during his first election against Gore, but I was 16 at the time and since I couldn&#39;t vote anyway I didn&#39;t pay a ton of attention. </p>

<p>I only really started paying attention to politics a year later when I was 17 and 9/11 happened.</p>

Read this: <a href="http://www.inquisitr.com/3570774/dont-like-trump-blame-hillary/">http://www.inquisitr.com/3570774/dont-like-trump-blame-hillary/</a></p>

<p>If not for Clinton making it happen, the Republicans probably would have nominated someone else. They almost managed it even with unprecedented free advertising from the Clinton-controlled media. </p>

<p>9/11/2016, HRC drunk or sick and passes out in a near coma on video, has to be picked up and thrown into her black ambulance/hearse, this was seen by 100s of millions both domestically and worldwide.</p>

<p>then they bring out Teresa and the other woman to play HRC for the camera, its 100% obvious that HRC is sick, too sick to run for POTUS, let alone be POTUS. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t think so. I&#39;ve been listening to him since he was on shortwave and selling DVDs on a site that looked like it was made on geocities. His message has always been good.</p>

<p>You can generally tell the good in something by the content of the message. Alex tells you to go research yourself. CNN says don&#39;t listen to anyone but us. Alex&#39;s message tells you to be active and think, prepare for the worst, hope for the best. Just common sense shit.</p>

<p>Some people like to call that fear mongering, though. For those people, if the fear finds them, they will be helpless.</p>

<p>I doubt very many people would be questioning 9/11 if it weren&#39;t for Alex. Despite the fact that people still believe the obviously absurd official story. He&#39;s done a lot of good work to be called a &quot;fucking joke.&quot; What have you done?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I believe that all the rumors are true. Too many predictions have been too accurate for it to make sense that somehow only these latest ones are false.</p>

<p>Those same sources are saying that despite the DOJ being totally corrupt, there are apparently NYC DA&#39;s and investigators who are prepared to indict or release all evidence. If either of these options were to occur, there would be serious potential for unrest in the country, due to how explosive and irrefutable the evidence apparently is, and how asleep most of the country has been. Therefore, the faction of disaffected law enforcement and other agents who have coalesced under Trump would logically prefer not to take this road since the more peaceful transition would involve Hillary stepping down.</p>

<p>The fact that Brett Baier and others had sources saying &quot;indictments were imminent&quot;, then went radio silent for close to 24 hours, then completely walked back their statements, to me says that a deal was made, and they have decided that, for the time being, the right decision is to continue the charade for the useful idiots in order to usher in a peaceful transition of power.</p>

<p>My prediction is that Hillary will resign for &quot;health reasons&quot;, potentially within hours. Negotiations are likely ongoing about details like who exactly gets thrown under the bus.</p>

<p>This is not the end though, other fights loom, depending on how much the Trump/law enforcement coalition actually does insist on cleaning house.</p>

<p>At any rate, unlike most predictions, these ones will be definitively confirmed or not in short order.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Has anyone considered that it&#39;s not a &quot;there&#39;s 2 sides to it&quot; kind of thing, but that it&#39;s a standard corrupt politician running against an insane corrupt business celebrity who doesn&#39;t know what he&#39;s doing and is making things up as he goes? Like pretty much every reasonable person saw through this a year ago, but now that it&#39;s a 2-person race we have to be positive about him to be balanced? </p>

<p>Can you please take a step back and look at this? Most of the Bernie supporters (like myself) are begrudgingly voting for Hillary because it&#39;s the only realistic option to prevent potential disaster, but all these people who realized Trump was an idiot when he started running are now passionately supporting him when he hasn&#39;t changed at all. I don&#39;t see what&#39;s Orwellian about pointing out that we probably shouldn&#39;t make an incredibly incompetent overgrown child the leader of the free world. If Jared Fogle (while still imprisoned) were running against Trump, there wouldn&#39;t be two sides to it either. There&#39;s an obviously better option. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The one thing I do agree on is that Trump disrupts a political system that needs to be disrupted. But there are far, far better ways that could be done and people it could be done through. There&#39;s limits to that if that&#39;s what you want, and Trump should exceed that limit. </p>

<p>Hillary&#39;s a continuation of what we already know goes on. At least with her as president, the status quo can be maintained and we can protest and fight against her. We know how things go with her type in charge, and we can put up someone better to beat her in 2020. A Trump presidency is not just a protest to the political elite, it&#39;s potential ruination of domestic and foreign policy with someone in charge who consistently demonstrates an unprecedented blatant level of ignorance and incompetence. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>How could Trump ruin foreign relations? By exactly what you&#39;re saying. We keep careful alliances with middle eastern countries for more reasons than oil and small donations. I don&#39;t like it either, but have you considered the ramifications of breaking them? </p>

<p>The level of corruption we&#39;ve seen from Hillary is pretty much what I expected, and if anything less than I expected, considering the extent to which we&#39;ve been able to look at her behind the scenes. </p>

<p>Yes I understand we&#39;ve been active in bombing campaigns. I think the right thing to do is temporarily ally with Assad and fight him through diplomatic means later. But ISIS is also on the verge of collapse, and it&#39;s looking to happen without an all-out invasion. Hillary, at most, is only leading us to diplomatic breakdowns with Russia. Neither her or Putin are interested in a war. She&#39;s experienced and politically intelligent, a no-fly zone would likely not lead to anything if actually implemented. Trump, on the other hand, goes to the extreme in our fight against terror. Whether or not he&#39;s used in recruiting videos (afaik, he has been recently), he&#39;s exactly what drums up anti-American support among terrorist groups. The tactics he wishes to use are the same things we&#39;ve tried and know only make things worse, except in movies. Not to mention he could be easily provoked by empty threats by powers like North Korea. </p>

<p>I agree with congressional term limits. Trump wouldn&#39;t have sole power to change that. </p>

<p>Hillary/Kaine wouldn&#39;t reboot the system. But the point isn&#39;t to reboot the system into chaos and turn our country into a joke. We can fight against them while they&#39;re in office, elect the right people in congress, and kick them out when the time comes. Disrupting the system is a positive I will admit came out of the Trump campaign, but we now have a movement to continue it, and we&#39;re not forced to put literally one of the most incompetent, idiotic, and easily-influenced people like him in office to make things happen. </p>

<p>In my view the only realistic option to prevent potential disaster is to NOT elect Clinton. Trump is an idiot beyond any doubt, but Clinton is a proven psychopath and mass murderer. Between the idiot and the psychopath, I choose the idiot easily.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Clinton probably never actually had political/legal/whatever opponents killed. We know Clinton isn&#39;t the literal butcher of Benghazi, you can take a reasonable look at what happened there. The only actually proven thing about her is that she&#39;s a mildly corrupt establishment politician who panders to things she doesn&#39;t care about and has some bad high-profile allies. She&#39;s exactly the type we should get out of our political system, but she&#39;ll get us by. (are we going to ignore the rumors about Trump, too? there are enough stories with flimsy evidence to portray him as a literal psychopath as well)</p>

<p>But even disregarding all that, let&#39;s call Hillary a psychopath and murderer - no, I strongly disagree. A psychopath is selfish but rarely actually chaotic. An idiot can mess with more than our freedoms. Not to mention being strongly susceptible to manipulation by the exact type you&#39;re worried about. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>She probably used the email server for convenience. It&#39;s almost impossible for someone in such a position to do their job in the modern era without that. I really, really don&#39;t care about it that much. I don&#39;t see how anyone who&#39;s been in a coma for the past few years, without any media or social influence, could wake up and hear that and not be like &quot;ok did anything important happen?&quot;</p>

<p>We don&#39;t even know if her email has been breached, it&#39;s still only rumors. What isn&#39;t a rumor is that the state department servers have been breached. Everything is susceptible (gmail, btw, is actually pretty strong on security if the user has the right practices). In the end it&#39;s a matter of protocol so long as she didn&#39;t directly allow someone access who shouldn&#39;t have it. I don&#39;t really care about that. </p>

<p>Even if you DO think this thing (which multiple high-level people on both sides in our government have done) is that important, she&#39;s still an infinitely better option than the alternative. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think there&#39;s a collective guilt building up about who will get empowered in this country/internationally if Trump were to win, the social freedoms and equality that might recede, the fact that ISIS, the european far right, and his American supporters all seem to be coming from the same anti-US establishment school. His campaign has thrived on labeling big media as untrustworthy, in Hillary&#39;s pocket, rendering truth itself unstable...instead, here, get the real scoop from such bastions of partisan-free, objective thought like Foxnews, breitbart, fucking Alex Jones, and a man who&#39;s been the figurehead of a hacker group bent on destabilizing any situation they don&#39;t like, good old Julian. </p>

<p>I too voted Sanders in light of Clinton&#39;s neoliberal centrism, and now find myself somehow defending her and her clan against the cynicism of everyone else. I want to believe all the conspiracies, but even then I know that a guy like Trump, with all the types who support/have created his whole campaign/will run his policy, basically represents a perfect nightmare...one the rest of the world seems to happily want.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thank you for a reasonable post. We&#39;ve gotten to the point where Trump and his supporters can literally just say shit and make stuff up, and non-partisan fact checks are considered attacks and part of the liberal media paid by the Clinton campaign. </p>

<p>The end of your statement is where I don&#39;t understand why no one else here sees this. We know Trump is an idiot. Even if Clinton is guilty of half the accusations against her, the same types who are like her (and even worse) are standing behind Trump. Trump can be manipulated and influenced by made-up graphs/pictures from random twitter accounts. You think the republican establishment can&#39;t do that to him with ease?</p>
