    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t think so. Him doing that would make him look like a poor sport right away. The only way that would have work is had she refused to consent (challenging her to being a poor sport). He has to unify a very divided US, and spending months convicting Hillary would lead to riots.</p>

<p>People don&#39;t care about the WikiLeaks as much as they care for who wins. It&#39;s solely our responsibility to reveal the rest of the leaks, and make the information public. It&#39;s solely our responsibility to keep the Clinton&#39;s (and anyone else corrupt, out of politics). Whether Clinton&#39;s in prison or Saudi Arabia, she still has a hand in US politics. Seeing what she has done already, i&#39;m concerned about continued violence being incited.</p>

<p>There&#39;s a small victory today in slamming the face of one globalist movement, but Trump is still guilty until proven innocent. The responsibility on our shoulders is as heavy as it ever was.</p>

<p>Edit: Glad to see this discussion. It should really be its own thread. I want her to be held accountable to. I&#39;ve been anti-Hillary the whole way through. As I said before, we need to continue digesting these leaks, and distribute them into something easy to reference/understand.</p>

<p>I think <a href="/u/-Toms-">/u/-Toms-</a> right. He needs to let the FBI and DoJ do its job. I&#39;m sure Obama will be pressuring them before he leaves office. There&#39;s a likelihood Trump may end up putting someone like Giuliani (whom hates the Clintons) in the DoJ, and just letting them handle it. Perhaps then she will just flee the country, egging on the continued investigation.</p>

<p>Someone else needs to fill the role she mounted for the Democrats though (please Bernie), or she could guilt trip/fund the public into doing some stupid shit. It seems counter-intuitive, but if I was in Trumps shoes, i&#39;d reach out to some of the more honest people in the Democratic Party now, and ask them to step up and take the reigns.</p>

<p>If we can get the info out there, some of the subreddits will be the backbone to dispersing this divisiveness of this country. Shedding its scales into a peace, through revealing the sheer criminality of these crime families. This does not just include the Clintons, although it starts with them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>the only thing Trump needs to do in regards to prosecuting Hillary is to just let the DOJ and FBI do their job instead of backdoor pressuring them. It seems pretty apparent to me they have stuff to move forward on. Like the email scandal, she DID send classified emails over an unsecured server, she DID send classified emails to people who didnt have clearance. The laws governing that DONT say anything about intent, which is why Comey said he didnt want to indict, she didnt INTEND to break the law. Well nobody gives a flying fuck, the law doesnt give a fuck about intent. </p>

<p>Bottom line is she did it, the FBI knows it, the DOJ knows it. Get Loretta Lynch and the handful of other people shown to be in with the Clintons out of the DOJ and get Comey out of the FBI. Then let the chips fall where they may when people do their jobs. </p>

<p>A few months ago, I was interviewing Trump by phone and I recommended that he not pick a vice president whom the mainstream of the Republican Party liked too much. If he did, I told Trump, they might help get him elected and then get rid of him.</p>

<p>And by that I meant impeachment — not the other thing.</p>

<p>Trump scoffed and said, “Don’t worry, we have some pretty smart people working for us, too.” OK, Donald, I thought, have it your way.</p>

Through corrupt presidents and government officials being out into place through the years and pulling the wool over people&#39;s eyes it has slowly eroded to the point where it was becoming more of a dictatorship. The American constitution was founded on just that though, keeping the power with the people. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;If the American people ever allow private banks to control the issue of their currency first by inflation then by deflation the banks and corporations that will grow up around them will deprive the people of all property until their children wake up homeless on the continent their Fathers conquered... I believe that banking institutions are more dangerous to our liberties than standing armies... The issuing power should be taken from the banks and restored to the people to whom it properly belongs.&quot; </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s not so much that the polls are faked, it&#39;s that the media worked to demonize Trump so much that people didn&#39;t want to admit that they were voting for him. They&#39;d say they were undecided, independent, or straight up Clinton. </p>

<p>I think that the DNC legitimately thought they had it in the bag, especially Pennsylvania, because of the polls showing their victory as the most likely scenario. They thought they&#39;d have record turnout because people were afraid of a Trump presidency, but it appears that the opposite was true. </p>

<p>On top of disenfranchising the primary voters, they got complacent, and failed to recapture all of those blue collar and union voters who were such staunch supporters of Bernie. </p>

<p>If Hillary had campaigned as if she was losing, she might have won. The DNC&#39;s and Hillary&#39;s arrogance lead to this, and they have no one to blame but themselves. It&#39;s going to be at least 2-4 years of a Republican majority Congress combined with a Republican President...a lot is going to change, for better or worse. </p>

<p>he has little to gain by pleasing them</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What?!  I just listed the things he can gain by playing ball!  </p>

<p>Every president wants an easier job, and being able to spread the narrative that you want affords a leader an enormous amount of power.  Hillary promised news outlets exclusive stories in exchange for choosing how they were written, and somehow still gained about 50% of the vote despite this, and her rampant corruption, being exposed.  Spin is in huge demand in politics.</p>

<p>Trump will be president now, he doesn&#39;t need the private sector to help distribute stories.  Paired with the fact that Obama repealed the laws prohibiting the US government from making propaganda, Trump already has an effective mouthpiece for his narrative.  Anything he gave to news companies would be eaten up, and spun however he wanted in exchange for the exclusive rights to the story.  </p>

<p>His history with the media will have no bearing on his presidency, if he&#39;s smart.  Plus, he&#39;s already talking about coming together as a country, I doubt he&#39;ll even press for justice in the Clinton case.  He&#39;s in power, he doesn&#39;t need anyone else&#39;s approval now, until he runs for re-election, or needs the senate&#39;s favor upon impeachment.</p>

<p>You&#39;re a fucking jackass for interfering in other countries&#39; elections, and especially for backing such a dumbfuck.

<p>I used to entertain the thought of moving there if this was the outcome, but knowing stupid fucks like you live there has thankfully made me reconsider. </p>

You don&#39;t know he&#39;s a habitual liar, cheat, con man, megalomaniac, pompous, crass windbag. You don&#39;t know the majority of the country views him as a joke. You wanted to be a centipede because it made the other cucks on 4chan notice less that you only post boring prattle. </p>

<p>News media in America has been discredited, biased, and outed for collusion in our country so many times, that people either ignore it or just get news from social media. And because of stupid, bored, unproductive, fucking attention seeking little shits like you, they have a completely wrong picture of what they&#39;re getting over the next 4 years. </p>

<p>If I could, I would give you my spot in this country as punishment for forcing this on people too young to vote. Since this isn&#39;t possible, I guess I&#39;ll just have to be satisfied that you&#39;re you, and you will have to be for the rest of your life. You truly are a piece of shit, and you deserve that the only thing people came to your shit island to see is now dying. Fuck yourself, hard. </p>

<p>So they are comparing Trump to Aurelian? (The Roman emperor who took power in AD270: famous for temporarily halting the decline of Rome: he conquered the lost eastern provinces and ended the crisis of the third century.) I think that&#39;s being very kind to Trump, and is probably over optimistic.</p>

<p>And I couldn&#39;t be happier as a result. I have zero problems shedding preconceived notions in light of facts. It&#39;s the very definition of being open-minded.</p>

<p>In this case, I made a post theorizing the general was rigged (especially because god knows the DNC primaries were). The fact that Trump won is the biggest symbolism that our votes may still matter for reform. </p>

<p>I love the election results for the single reason that it proves to me that the will of the people still determines who gets the presidency. </p>

<p>With that said, truth plays out alongside events. Trump could no doubt be a monster--most of us are saying he&#39;s a terrible candidate with terrible policies--but the crux of this election for most of us here is whether or not a corrupt candidate with every possible advantage could swindle her way into the white house. The answer to that question was no.</p>

<p>Now, of course our attention will turn to Trump, his actions, and if he&#39;s at all honest (he probably isn&#39;t). Maybe it&#39;ll be discovered that Soros funded Trump and other more powerful factions actually appointed him for president--this theory isn&#39;t likely, but the main point is, <em>we will stay open minded</em>.</p>

<p>Man, that&#39;s the thing making this so much less exciting. Nothing was &quot;won&quot; today. Good job america. Out of fear and hatred for <strong>one small example</strong> of how shitty our system is, we voted in a differently awful individual. Trump will of course be a disaster, but in the chaos real opportunities for change might accidentally spring up, and it will be entertaining as fuck. But people need to realize Hilary was just one ugly head of the hydra, and the elites will probably learn a lot of lessons from this so it only gets shittier from here unless people really wake up to what is going on. </p>

<p>As far as nobody thinking Trump would win, well, nobody predicted the wikileaks. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t think so. The man knows how to bring in a team of experts to manage the areas he doesn&#39;t know about and that&#39;s how he banked in Business and licensing. Its not that hard to be President, you literally just have to surround yourself with geniuses and manage them.</p>

<p>Because he runs a multi-billion dollar Real Estate and Licensing company. Sure he made some bad moves/decisions, but always came back and learned from it. The biggest thing is that Trump has said a few years ago that we are undergoing a Deindustrialization and slow collapse that is destroying the country (Thanks NAFTA/Bill Clinton/Globalists) and that he would consider running for Pres in the Future to undo this, so he has his own empire on the stake as well.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>His company is literally a team of experts: construction/development partners/financing/lawyers/etc that help run a number of companies with Thousands of employees. Running the U.S. is somewhat similar in that you have a board of directors in place and you manage them. Pence also brought in big time incentives in Indiana that convinced a number of businesses/factories to move there and create jobs.</p>

<p>Of course there is a chance for that, and Dems cock blocking any bills he tries to pass. But I doubt it. I&#39;m sure this man understands the Brevity of what is at hand. He&#39;s had a ton of interviews directly calling out the elite/1% globalists, George Soros, Banksters, etc and No One has run for President and lived, talking in this manner.</p>

<p>I think you&#39;re going to see the bankers tank the markets and try to blame it on him starting tomorrow</p>

<p>This last point for me would = a successful presidency and reset the DNC. If Clintons/Foundation/Pedosta&#39;s are all jailed/broken up, then its a 100% win in my book</p>

<p>He already had money and connections thanks to his family. And during the decades he built his name, real estate prices were going crazy. Pretty much anyone could have had a successful business starting out the way he did and just buying random land. I do agree that we need to bring back production to the country, so maybe he will help with that. I don&#39;t think being president and being CEO are very much alike other than that they are figureheads. Companies and a world power are not run the same way. If we start worrying about quarterly financial reports that only allow growth over growth(i.e. what shareholders want the CEO to do) then this country is fucked, because we&#39;ve seen what kind of horrible HR situations that causes in the big companies. </p>

<p>Dems won&#39;t cockblock him because the republicans took congress. What do you suppose he will actually do against the 1% though? He isn&#39;t gonna bust up Monsanto or the telecoms or energy companies. He isn&#39;t gonna go after the money guys and Wall Street, unless they make him look really bad and it bruises his ego. I do agree they will probably blame him for the market crash(which would have happened under Hilary as well, every 4-8 years as we all know), and unfortunately that will be a boost for globalism if they convince people his isolationism caused the crash. Lets see if he can get all the international corporations and Cayman island bullshit actually taxed, eh? (I&#39;m not betting on it). </p>

<p>Resetting DNC would be nice since they need it after all the decay from shitty liar neocons like the Clintons and Obama. But that&#39;s not 100%, not even 10% win. With Hilary gone there would still be a ton of bad guys in DC. Congress, all the agencies and contractor companies and stuff between defense, energy, fda etc etc etc. And, again, he won&#39;t be able to(or probably even try) to do much about the corporations that are above international law at this point. Knocking out Hilary, Podesta and another dozen people from the leaks is nice(and mandatory) but it&#39;s token; the corruption is still all around and now they know to keep it subtle. Stepping on a few cockroaches versus poisoning or starving the whole swarm, you know? Or even burning the house down. </p>

<p>Trump <em>might</em> not be a complete waste of time if we get lucky and he gets the right information but there is no reason to expect that given what we know about how the world works. </p>

<p>I agree, it&#39;s much more than economics, but what&#39;s awesome is that we need to put us first for a change and start pulling all the financing/AID to other countries, reinvest in ourselves, infrastructure, get off Saudi oil, garbage non-gold-back currency.

<p>Put Hillary/Podesta/DNC crooks in jail, pull out of middle east, cut ties with Saudi&#39;s. If he just does those 3 things, the we are at war successfully instead of outright losing as has been the case..</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You... You&#39;re the type of person that doesnt understand how being filthy fucking rich is (when you didn&#39;t initially try). You can fuck up every single time in life if you were born into money, and still be alright. You were born with connections, and born with a plan laid out for you. All he did was follow it, and he still fucked up a ton on the way to stability (like investing in the housing market right before 2007, for one). </p>

<p>Being a &quot;multi billionaire&quot; does not imply shit. Rich people can basically buy luck, and luck is all takes to get there. Luck in keeping your connections, meeting the right people, and the luck to have your investments work out. Life is determined soo much more by chance than by choice. </p>

<p>But no, most people on reddit have a hard time accepting that life is Almost completely out of your control. All he knew was business, so of course he never pussied out. When you&#39;ve got that much luck, all you got to do is keep trying and its a matter of time. </p>

<p>I hope that a makes sense.
 it&#39;s similar how it just comes down to chance where you&#39;re born: People in poverty didn&#39;t strive to be poor their whole.lives, most were born into it. Don&#39;t believe its always their fault. Don&#39;t believe its always rich people&#39;s fault that they&#39;re rich, either. </p>

<p>From another comment of mine: during the decades he built his name, real estate prices were going crazy. Pretty much anyone could have had a successful business starting out the way he did(money and connections from family) and just buying random land.</p>

Pretty simple strategy, the Clintons just couldnt produce enough to counter wikileaks, but I knew it was coming, they said this stuff would be released from the start.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>As an outsider, this sub has gone from a kinda goofy place where people still think Bush did 9/11, WTC 7 yada yada, to a de-facto Trump/Rep echo chamber. Of course it&#39;s not my place to dictate what the content of this sub should be, but I would&#39;ve thought that it should look at and discuss possible conspiracies wherever they may be and whoever they involve.</p>

<p>If this sub was true to it&#39;s original cause we&#39;d see, for instance, discussions on Trump&#39;s alleged links to the Mafia while building his business empire; and if Hillary had refused to release her tax returns and was accused of tax avoidance we&#39;d see no end of references to how, at the very best, it&#39;s immoral, and at worst, completely inappropriate for a presidential candidate. But all I see is a whole lot of cognitive dissonance surrounding his past.</p>

<p>Also, I&#39;ve seen a whole lot of accusations of CTR taking over <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a>. Well, if you think that Trump didn&#39;t hire people to do similar work for him - maybe even here in <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> where 2/3 of all mods were appointed 1 year or less ago - then you need to take a long hard look at yourself.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>vote for what? A clinton (the second) the president&#39;s wife &quot;versus&quot; a clinton donor and family friend, TV personality and WWE Raw actor / slumlord Donald Trump, such democracy, wow. people&#39;s democratic republic of america over here. No worries everyone this is how we have our say in how the country is run!</p>

<p>next time we&#39;ll get a president&#39;s son &quot;versus&quot; his own frat brother, like it was when Bush the Second &quot;ran&quot; for president. does not matter in the least who you vote for. It&#39;s the american equivalent of Putin&#39;s wife and Putin&#39;s donor/golfing buddy being set up to &quot;run against each other&quot; for president in Russia, it&#39;s totally and utterly meaningless and is only there to control the national political narrative, legitimize the Putin mafia regardless of who &#39;wins&#39;, and keep the Russian poor thinking they&#39;ve got a voice or a &#39;vote&#39; so that they stay in their houses and don&#39;t make trouble for the ruling class out in the streets - and so the ruling class can use violence against everyone else in society while hiding behind a legal framework they pretend is based on democracy, meanwhile claiming &#39;peaceful transfer of power&#39;, when really we see people in our country seize power over others with violence every day.</p>

<p>When 2 families are passing the highest offices and appointments back and forth between themselves and their own wives, sons, frat brothers, and donors, there&#39;s something very obviously wrong here, and you are contributing to the problem by pretending otherwise, and by pretending everything is normal and &quot;go vote&quot; etc. etc. The fact that so few people even bring that up is another sign of a North Korea level social management scheme. Everyone wants to believe in whatever ideals make them feel good about themselves and empowered, nobody wants to deal with the horrendous realities, here in the US or in DPRK or Russia or China or anywhere else. Watching the whole &quot;go vote&quot; thing is like watching a parade of people in North Korea crying over dear leader. it&#39;s just for show and everyone should know it by now.  </p>

<p>Maybe some day people will quit all the pretending and start dealing with facts, and with the facts as they are, how anyone can keep pretending that the voting actually matters is beyond me.   Nothing can improve if people don&#39;t recognize that there&#39;s anything going wrong.  People in positions of power can do <em>whatever they want</em> for as long as a majority of us just don&#39;t question what we can see is wrong. They can get away with murder, fraud, mass murder, repeated mass murder, mass theft, tax theft, confiscation and suppression of information, kidnapping, false imprisonment, etc. - until people go &quot;wait a minute.. something is wrong here.&quot;</p>

<p>the voting literally does not matter in this instance. voting would matter if people took it seriously on a local, state, and congressional level. The presidential elections are given such media hype <em>specifically because</em> they don&#39;t really matter and they are symbolic of &#39;power&#39;, not actually where the power lies. The 2 candidates can be picked/pre-selected so that nobody who will rock the boat can get in, and here we are, watching all the things I&#39;ve described above take place over and over.</p>

<p>Voting would matter if people cared about it for more than just a single office once every 4 years.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You can rig a primary, but you can&#39;t rig a general election, at least not in the sense that people think. It&#39;s simply not feasible in an election of over 100 million votes to use voter fraud or rigged voting machines without drawing too much attention, and the penalties are so great that it&#39;s not worth the risk. You have to do it by winning the hearts of people and by getting them fired up to vote for you, even if your policies aren&#39;t 100% in line with their views. Clinton failed to do that, and unsuccessfully swayed voter opinion enough to win her those key swing states. All of those deplorables and basement dwellers vote too, and theirs count just as much as everyone else&#39;s. </p>

<p>There simply wasn&#39;t the drive to get out and vote for her like there was for Bernie and Trump. After the primary, it seemed like most left-leaning voters were either begrudgingly voting for Clinton, not voting at all, or voting for Trump out of spite. That&#39;s no way to win a general election. </p>

<p>If one side has a candidate that voters are fired up about, and the other is simply depicted as the lesser evil by their constituency, I&#39;d bet on the one that voters are fired up about every time. Those are the voters who will definitely be in line to support their candidate and who will convince undecided and middle ground voters to vote for them. </p>

<p>To call her supporters traitors because they passionately and sometimes violently oppose Trump is rdiculous. Which is why I ake if he also is the few violent Trump supporters as traitors. </p>

For weeks r/Conspiracy has pushed the narrative over and over that the voting machines were owned by so and so that was somehow related to Hillary and that they were calculatedly manipulating her win illegally.

<p>I don&#39;t think the middle class think that at all.  I think much of the vote for him is an anti-hillary vote.  We will never know.</p>

<p>In fact, if we had a legit 3rd party participating from the start in all debates and activities, we might have a 3rd party president.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I for one am VERY excited that Trump won. Though I didn&#39;t vote for him, or anyone. I was one of those, votes don&#39;t matter guys. (Which is true to an extent.) I was hopeless and thought no matter what we did TPTB would pick our leaders for us and continue fucking us over. This proved me wrong and I LOVE it!</p>

<p>This election proves, beyond a shadow of a doubt, that if the people rally hard enough behind a candidate they can win. The establishment piled heaps of shit on Trump. They called his followers all kinds of nasty things. If you support Trump you are an uneducated racist misogynistic bigot! They just kept piling the shit up and piling it up. So what did the people do? They saw through the bullshit, elected Trump, and shoved the shit right back into the face of the establishment! Oh what a day to be American!</p>

<p>I have never been more proud of my countrymen. Trump is not perfect, by anyone&#39;s standards, but he&#39;s a damn sight better than that corrupt puppet Clinton. I am sorry for not believing sooner and taking my ass to the polls, but to those of you that voted, THANK YOU!</p>

I&#39;m so happy he won. Hillary is the living embodiment of evil and I refused to believe Trump was as shitty as everyone was saying. There were DIRECT COMPARISONS to Adolph Fucking Hitler.

    <div class="md"><p>I was actually not going to vote until I saw a Hillary ad. The ad in question showed a little boy (who wouldn&#39;t be able to vote for what seemed like the next two elections) watching a commercial for Donald speaking and it infamously cuts to the part where he says &quot;I would tell them to go fuck themselves&quot; and then a few more things that were anti-Trump. I didn&#39;t know it was an ad campaign until the end when it said &quot;paid for by Hillary Clinton&quot; or whatever it says. I had a few thoughts. The little boy was irrelevant and pandering, Clinton is a bitch because it&#39;s pure smear and nothing positive, I respect anyone that can have the balls to tell someone to go fuck themselves in front of thousands live and millions watching. It backfired and I decided then and there I will vote and that vote will be for Donald Trump </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Nah bro, the best part will be watching the US fall from grace off the world stage. Russia will go full tilt in Syria and the Ukraine. Turkey will wipe out the Kurds and try to invade Iraq. China will take over the South china sea and won&#39;t hesitate using military force. Iran will fire up it&#39;s nuke program. Israel will probably &#39;cleanse&#39; Palestine. NATO/UN will have no power.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Dude, Shilldog would&#39;ve continued the status quo of Obama&#39;s legacy. Which means the world would have stayed stable. Not to mention she is well versed in world politics. Corrupt as fuck but well versed none the less.    </p>

<p>Trump is a fucking reality TV star. Who was saved from bankruptcy by the Rothschild dynasty in the late 80s. He has some big promises to fulfill. I&#39;d say he&#39;ll be feeling more terrified than anyone else at the moment.  </p>

<p>Think about that for a minute. You have a 70 year old man that has never done anything unless it was in his self interest. Dude isn&#39;t even aware of what&#39;s taking place in the world.  </p>

<p>America has just elected a senile joke. World leaders are going to take advantage of this. I can just imagine the parties happening in political circles around the world. Vlad is probably erect, without the help of viagra, for the first time in years.  </p>

<p>My advice, to those of you in the US, is to buy gold. Your dollars not going to be worth shit in a year - in fact it&#39;ll probably be on parity with the peso.</p>

<p>&quot;Wikileaks has a 10-year record of never releasing a single falsified document, and is not connected to Russia. Everything they released were the actual e-mails of Hillary Clinton and her campaign staff. You had the opportunity to look through a window into the Hillary Clinton campaign, but you didn’t.
By ignoring the leaks, you ignored reality.
By not listening to your fellow Americans, and accusing them of being “conspiracy theorists” and trusting the corporate media, you ignored reality. By only following other liberals on social media, and only reading liberal or corporate news, once again ignoring reality. When Hillary Clinton was caught rigging the primary against Bernie Sanders, and Democrats nominated her anyway they ignored reality.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have a theory about that, I think the vote was rigged, maybe even as much as twenty percent, but Trump supporters came out in droves to vote, more than they predicted. That is why we don&#39;t have any recounts going on because then the investigations would show the mass corruption.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>NBC, ABC, and CBS all stopped reporting the progress, both LIVE and on the net. It was hours at a &#39;standstill&#39; when clearly Trump was the winner yet they &#39;refused&#39; and LIED about the numbers being too close. BS.
One could easily find the LIVE voting counter for each state. You could see which state Trump would easily win and vice versa. The last few hours was bought out media corruption. You could feel their uneasiness and they were all pro-Clinton. Regardless, she needs punishment for all the crimes she has committed.</p>

<p>I have a website idea,. actually, but unsure of its legality. Basically, you call it something like realfakenews.com. It trolls all of the major news outlets and by some smart algorithm takes short, highly accurate snippets of that sites content. When a story hits, realfakenews is first on google (somehow) and takes hits away from  the major news sites. It&#39;ll smartly itemize content based on political leanings, potential business influence, etc. Any metric desirable can be measured and highlighted to show agendas. We can view their biased nonsense for giggles and restrict ad revenue and page hits all at the same time.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Likely not, but the underlying principle has some merit. The media is supposed to report the news. They used to, then decided they&#39;d toss in their own opinions. Before long, it&#39;s just another arm of the government. They don&#39;t even report actual news. That wikileaks/hillaryforprison stuff wasn&#39;t just happening on some sleazy pocket of the internet. It was huge, and the media kept it hush. Luckily for us, we beat them at their own game.

    <div class="md"><p>the only thing Trump needs to do in regards to prosecuting Hillary is to just let the DOJ and FBI do their job instead of backdoor pressuring them. It seems pretty apparent to me they have stuff to move forward on. Like the email scandal, she DID send classified emails over an unsecured server, she DID send classified emails to people who didnt have clearance. The laws governing that DONT say anything about intent, which is why Comey said he didnt want to indict, she didnt INTEND to break the law. Well nobody gives a flying fuck, the law doesnt give a fuck about intent. </p>

<p>Bottom line is she did it, the FBI knows it, the DOJ knows it. Get Loretta Lynch and the handful of other people shown to be in with the Clintons out of the DOJ and get Comey out of the FBI. Then let the chips fall where they may when people do their jobs. </p>
