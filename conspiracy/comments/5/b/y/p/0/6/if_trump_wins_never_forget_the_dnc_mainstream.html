    <div class="md"><p>Exactly. I&#39;m watching the PBS coverage right now and they&#39;re trying to explain what happened and talking about &quot;soul searching&quot; as if they&#39;re unaware of all the scandals. The simple fact is Bernie Sanders was more likable, had better policies, and was not a fucking straight up cocky liar like Hillary. I have hope for Trump. I think if he gets good people around him, he could do very well. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Looking at the numbers in each state it seems like if the DNC had picked Bernie they would have won because it was as close as 75,000 votes in some places. The way I see it, each scandal lost them at least that much. Bernie would have easily brought that many more people out just based on the fact that he was likable. The email scandal alone probably lost Hillary that much. Having a dead fish of a VP like Kaine probably lost her that much. I have always leaned left and I really don&#39;t like Trump&#39;s policy on abortion, for instance, and that would make me vote Bernie if it were Bernie, but like you I think most people are sick of the lies from the DNC, and those of us who have been paying attention to the latest revelations absolutely could not vote for her in good conscience. The only solution for democrats is just a complete reform of the DNC, but don&#39;t lose hope on Trump yet because he could surprise everyone again.</p>

My issue with her was she was talking about 9/11 conspiracies while she could have been focusing on the DNC conspiracy which was more relevant at the time. She could have gathered a lot more support for third parties. </p>

<p>It&#39;s fact and there is evidence of it. 
Pollsters have a 5 point margin of error (they say) the problem is every poll had Bernie WAY outside of that  margin. 10+ points on every candidate. </p>

<p>There&#39;s no apples to oranges he was the choice. Short of him declaring his determination for a fourth Reich but he is Jewish so idk how that would work. </p>

<p>He stuck to issues, that would have destroyed Trump because there&#39;s no banter to have Trump would have made a fool of himself and Sanders would have been stoic and on message. 
His honesty and pedigree made him the choice. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve never trusted either thing. This election just made sure I NEVER will. It has also shown me in stark terms that at least 47.3 percent of my country is retarded and has no concern for responsible behavior. And that, more than the president, is disturbing.</p>

<p>On a slightly bright side, most of that stupidity is confined to the East Coast and West coast and state capitals. The trendy areas of the country which depend upon the working class to exist.</p>

In there you find recently released foia documents from the national archives had 5000 pages of documents pertaining to the Clinton administration and trumps organization. One finds the Clinton administration flirting with the idea of trump running as a third party in 1999.
Bill Clinton called Donald trump weeks before he announced running and right after hillary Clinton announced running last year in may. </p>

<p>The one thing the US media knows without a doubt about the American public is that the vast majority of them do not trust the media. They know that if the media says one thing, most people will believe the opposite.</p>

<p>So how do the powerful use the media to their advantage when that is the situation? They simply get the media to support the <em>opposite</em> of what they actually want.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hillary won California by a million votes, my vote for Gary Johnson had no effect on Hillary or Trump and supported neither, I voted 3rd party because I don&#39;t support war, nor do I support Hillary or Trump. So again you are wrong to say voting 3rd party resulted in Trump winning.</p>

    <div class="md"><p><em>You</em> are the real problem with American politics.</p>

<p>When people like you convince others that a 3rd party candidate can&#39;t win, you perpetuate the corrupt two party system.</p>

<p>On one hand you have people that would prefer the Libertarian candidate voting for the Republicans, and on the other you have people that would have preferred the Green Party candidate voting for the Democrats.</p>

<p>If all those people actually voted for the candidate they preferred, rather than settling for &quot;second best&quot;, a 3rd party candidate might actually win.</p>

<p>But instead people like you convince them that voting against their interests is in their interests.</p>

<p>It&#39;s retarded.</p>
