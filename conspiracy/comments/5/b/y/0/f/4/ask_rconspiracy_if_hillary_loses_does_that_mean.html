Billions of dollars, dozens of reputations, and uncountable biased articles trying to hypnotize/force everyone to vote for her.  There seems to be some special reason that they feel they <em>need</em> to have her in office.  If Trump &quot;wins&quot;, I&#39;ll expect something very terrible and dramatic to happen between now and January.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>They over played their hand . They are extremely powerful but not in total control. They put their faith in media collusion and smear campaigns on msm but msm is not used utilized they way it was . The internet is what the newspaper was since msm died we all became journalists and political analysts   problem is they can&#39;t pay or kill us all.  Now they will engineer financial system meltdown and blame trump mite take 4 years but establishment try promiss you stability after that with a bush or Clinton type.  They still have players inside that government.  Its not a total loss for them it just make things a little difficult and set back some plans.  The potus is only one guy  any choices or plans he wishes to institute must pass threw congress. don&#39;t worry im sure the illuminate  will be ok  . hope he drones them all but lol. </p>

<p>yeah thats is. Its unfortunate that mindless bullies who are charming can get to these positions. I have experienced it on personal level but now i know its on a much bigger level.</p>

<p>With that said i am a huge skeptic and maybe this is where we should start.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>well watching it in the rec room on black &amp; white tv it was funny....
how did they get offa the moon .... especially given the level of tech was at in 1969 no n no we boasted and we had to do something cuz  the decade was almost over and so we were never there and  kubrick filmed it...[the rocks had numbers just like a stage set....</p>

<p>im not a kook i am an empathet i think science should be open minded to allow the seen and the unseen thats to me quantum all the way trusting that the math is gonna take you in the right direction....</p>

<p>and there is still so much more to understand......[ps has trump won? or not offiial yet?</p>

<p>My thoughts have always been that of course both candidates ate selected by the NWO/Illuminati/cabal whatever you want to call it.</p>

<p>That being said, the cabal is split into factions that are fighting each other for control.</p>

<p>So the answer is both. Yes they win, and yes they lose. Which factions win or lose is the real question.</p>
