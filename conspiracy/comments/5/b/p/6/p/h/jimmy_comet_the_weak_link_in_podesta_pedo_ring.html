        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>For some strange reason, a pizza joint owner named James Alefantis is listed as the 49th most powerful man in Washington DC.   How did this happen?   </p>

<p>James Achilles Alefantis aka &quot;Jimmy Comet&quot; is the ex-lover of David Brock, who runs Hillary&#39;s propaganda super-pac &quot;Correct the Record&quot;.   He also owns Comet Ping Pong, which bills itself as a family friendly hipster pizza joint with ping pong tables and live performances by (often satanic) rock bands.   </p>

<p>Internet sleuths discovered numerous references to pizza, cheese, pasta and hotdogs in the Podesta emails that seemed to make no sense.   For example &quot;The realtor found a handkerchief (I think it has a map that seems pizza-related&quot;), or a man dreaming of &quot;your hotdog stand in Hawaii.&quot;   One pizza place in particular kept standing out: Comet Ping Pong.  </p>

<p>Hillary&#39;s campaign is run by John Podesta.  He previously served as chief of staff to President Bill Clinton and Counselor to President Barack Obama.   He is famous for his &quot;pizza parties.&quot;  One such party was attended by the Pope.  </p>

<p>John Podesta has strange taste in art.   <a href="http://stateofthenation2012.com/?p=55508">Here&#39;s</a> a picture hanging in his office at Clinton campaign headquarters.     </p>

<p>“The image shows two men hunched over a dining room table, bearing knives and forks. On the table lays a man in a suit, who looks vaguely like Podesta.”</p>

<p>&quot;Podesta’s painting is incredibly <a href="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CwbYyouWQAEgTDl.jpg">similar</a> to one of Abramović’s art displays in which she and pop star Lady Gaga eat off of a mock bloodied body.&quot;</p>

<p>Abramavic refers to Marina Abramović, a &quot;performance artist&quot; who cooks with...well, Wikileaks tweeted the secret recipe: </p>

<p>The Podestas’ “Spirit Cooking” dinner?
It’s not what you think.
It’s blood, sperm and breastmilk.
But mostly blood. </p>

<p>If you have the stomach for it you can watch videos of Abramavic&#39;s &quot;performance art&quot; online.  </p>

<p>The Podestas are apparently into this stuff, judging from the email exchange with Abramovic.   </p>

<p>Liberal blogs have responded to the revelation by claiming that backwards Christians are persecuting a cutting edge &quot;artist&quot; and that it&#39;s perfectly normal to mix blood, sperm and breastmilk with food.  Whatever.  </p>

<p>And now we go from the bizarre to the deeply disturbing.    </p>

<p>An article about John Podesta in the Washington Post, which has since been removed, notes that his taste in art doesn&#39;t end with cannibalism: </p>

<blockquote>
<p>“Folks attending a house tour in the Lake Barcroft neighborhood in Falls Church earlier this year got an eyeful when they walked into a bedroom at the Podesta residence hung with multiple color pictures by Katy Grannan, a photographer known for documentary-style <strong>pictures of naked teenagers in their parents’ suburban homes.</strong>” </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Archive of article:</p>

<p><a href="https://archive.fo/vddrO">https://archive.fo/vddrO</a></p>

<p>Jeffrey Epstein, Bill&#39;s pedophile buddy, also had pictures of naked teenagers hanging on his walls.   Apparently they&#39;re pretty open with this stuff.   Their ruling class friends don&#39;t seem to blink and eye.  </p>

<p>Here is John Podesta referring to a <a href="https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/56492">torture chamber</a></p>

<p>If you think John has sick taste in art, wait till you get a load of his brother.  </p>

<p>Tony Podesta&#39;s favorite artist is <a href="https://i.sli.mg/dBY95x.jpg">biljana djurdjevic</a> who specializes in art with blatantly pedophilic themes, and more than that, <em>sadistic pedophilic themes.</em>  The term for this, in child pornography circles, is called &quot;hurtcore.&quot;   </p>

<p>Tony Podesta is also a life-long friend of Dennis Hasterd, disgraced pedophile and former Speaker of the House.   Hasterd was a Republican.  This is a bi-partisan affair.   </p>

<p>Now back to that pizza place and James Achilles Alefantis aka Jimmy Comet.   Here is <a href="https://media.8ch.net/file_store/61a7bab1f585b3e72a160c7d2659e55f92c184a0253edea67253de96c489213f.png">Tony Podesta</a> with Alefantis, celebrating the former&#39;s birthday at Comet Ping Pong.   This obscure DC pizza joint has hosted numerous Democratic Party fundraisers, including for Hillary Clinton.  </p>

<p>Here is a <a href="https://archive.fo/Jeh0X">letter</a> from Hillary herself thanking Jimmy.  </p>

<p>Another day on the campaign trail? </p>

<p>Apparently not.   </p>

<p>Here is Jimmy at the White House with <a href="https://archive.is/4uB5R">President Obama</a> (POTUS is playing ping pong with a boy), and here is Jimmy admiring a <a href="https://archive.is/LIHTn">statue</a> (supposedly modeled after one of Jeffrey Dahmer&#39;s victims) in Tony Podesta&#39;s home.   Obama had phone banks at Comet Ping in 2012.   </p>

<p>Jimmy has made <a href="http://imgur.com/Ia1lLQK">several tripst</a> to the White House.  </p>

<p>And we wouldn&#39;t be complete without a George Soros link: Soros&#39; American Bridge Pac sent this <em>pizza joint</em> $21,864.25.</p>

<p><a href="http://search04.fec.gov/vivisimo/cgi-bin/query-meta?input-form=advanced-fec&amp;query=Alefantis&amp;v%3Asources=Administrative_Fine&amp;v%3Asources=Advisory_Opinion&amp;v%3Asources=Alternative_Dispute_Resolution&amp;v%3Asources=Audit_Reports&amp;v%3Asources=Matters_Under_Review&amp;v%3Asources=Matters_Under_Review_Archived&amp;v%3Asources=Rulemaster&amp;v%3Asources=Candidate_Summary&amp;v%3Asources=Committee_Summary&amp;v%3Asources=fec.gov&amp;v%3Asources=Disbursements&amp;v%3Asources=Receipts&amp;v%3Asources=Other.Transactions&amp;v%3Aproject=fec_search_02_prj">Here</a> is a list of other donations made by Hillary Pacs to Alefantis.  </p>

<p>Speaking of birthday traditions, here is Jimmy Commet&#39;s: cutting a <a href="https://media.8ch.net/file_store/96c3c350173407d4892681a30b769d6c52590ad9aeba03398361116fe57c7461.png">&quot;flaccid penis&quot;-shaped cake.</a>  </p>

<p>Okay.  So far we have two pedophiles, John and Tony Podesta, at the center of the Clinton campaign.   These figures are also linked to Jeffrey Epstein.   And we have a third person, James Achilles Alefantis aka &quot;Jimmy Comet&quot;, who runs a pizza joint.  </p>

<p>What goes on this pizza joint?   As mentioned, Comet Ping Pong bills itself as a &quot;family friendly&quot; hangout.   Which is odd, since among the various pictures of kids eating pizza on their instagram, they also have photos like <a href="https://media.8ch.net/file_store/90de43239a739b0f4ea8c6054465b5639d4b3515abcd59008200fddf1eb87697.png">this</a>.

<p>What kind of music shows do they put on?  Well, here&#39;s one example: </p>

<p><a href="https://i.sli.mg/kHXqhi.jpg">Here</a> is another poster for a rock concert at Comet Ping Pong.  It shows, well, look for yourself. </p>

<p><a href="https://i.4cdn.org/pol/1478529885895.jpg">By the same artist</a></p>

<p>Not only are kids welcome at this place, they sometimes host <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0BzzKlTLarZr8eWlCeE9DOUZtX00/view">sleepovers</a></p>

<p>Now we get to Jimmy&#39;s instagram, and where the real horror begins.   He has since set it to provide, but sleuths on 4 and 8chan managed to archive much of the material.   Jimmy responded to the allegations about Comet Ping Pong by saying there’s no truth to the bizarre allegations: &quot;The whole election has really just been insane.&quot;   In typical fashion the corporate media is referring to &quot;conspiracy theories.&quot;   </p>

<p>Take a look at the following, and judge for yourself.   Alefantis was the weak link, the Achilles heel of the operation.  While most of the people involved were content to use code language, Alefantis was completely open about his pedophilia.  He couldn&#39;t resist making repeated, obvious sexual references accompanied by pictures of children and even babies.   </p>

<p>(Warning: this is disturbing stuff.)   </p>

<p>&quot;Ping Pong in London sounds tempting!&quot;  </p>

<p>One of Jimmy&#39;s pals on Instagram is Cboutlier.   </p>

<p>Here is a photo posted by Christopher Boutlier which <a href="https://i.sli.mg/S0dWca.png">bizarrely</a> contains the words &quot;gaybaby.&quot;  </p>

<p>Here is an <a href="http://abovethelaw.com/2010/07/lawyerly-lairs-an-associate-and-an-art-collection/">article</a> about Boutlier.   </p>

<p>Wouldn&#39;t you know it?  He&#39;s also into pedophilic art.  </p>

<p>And finally, here is the most sickening of all of Jimmy&#39;s posts...</p>

<p><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0BzzKlTLarZr8OXJGdWtFRktVcXc/view">&quot;Yum...Baby&quot;</a></p>

<p>I want you to think long and hard if you, as a grown adult, would ever look at a picture of a baby and say the word &quot;yum.&quot;  </p>

<p>The Event Organizer for Comet Ping Pong is Sasha Lord.   <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0BzzKlTLarZr8SVQwVkFNVDNpdzA/view">Here</a> is her bio.   She works with &quot;at-risk&quot; youth, &quot;Girl Scouts Beyond Bars,&quot; and &quot;running an outreach Girl Scout Troop at the Prince William Detention Center.&quot;  </p>

<p>Speaking of at-risk youth, right across the street from Comet Ping Pong is non-profit called Terosol that specializes in &quot;homeless and runaway youth.&quot;    Their homepage features a picture of Hillary Clinton.   It also features their logo -- a heart within a heart -- which the <a href="https://i.sli.mg/TcMOz6.png">FBI</a> lists as a symbol for &quot;girl lover&quot;.   </p>

<p>Incredibly, another pizza place on the same block, Besta pizza, <em>also</em> has a pedophile <a href="https://i.sli.mg/1XVf9d.png">symbol</a> as their logo, in this case, &quot;boy lover.&quot;  </p>

<p>There is now abundant circumstantial evidence that the Clintons are involved in a pedophile ring.   If the FBI fails to act, we should consider them complicit and act accordingly when arrests are finally made.   </p>

<p>I&#39;m embarrassed for not picking that up earlier.  I didn&#39;t even look at dr.nwo&#39;s name.  These people just seem so blatant in what they do, I thought they would have the audacity to say something like that within their circle... but you&#39;re right. shit.</p>

<p>Very probable that it was a autchanner shit posting on it.  In my defense, he was way early vs. when we were learning about this stuff.  drNWO was like 5 days ahead of everyone else, assuming he wasn&#39;t one of the pedos.</p>

<p>Is this the reason they overstated the damage of Hurricane Matthew?  So that they could steal children?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m all for people looking into this, but there&#39;s one thing that always bugs the shit out of me when people &quot;investigate&quot; the lives of public figures.</p>

<p>&quot;Oh look, a college hipster that&#39;s into niche and edgy &quot;art,&quot; just like other people that you commonly find in art schools. What do you think of him? Nothing, just another edgy hipster college student.</p>

<p>Now take that exact same person, but it&#39;s the future and they&#39;ve grown up to become a public figure. What do you think of him? He&#39;s a satanic cannibal pedophile!!!&quot;</p>

<p>You see this exact stuff from students all across art schools. People shoving shit up their twats while recording, eating fake bodies, using period blood for some &quot;deep statement,&quot; on and on and on. Yet, surprise surprise, some of these people actually go on to become famous, rich, or public figures, and you think their interests and quirks change deep down? Fuck no.</p>

<p>Jack Parsons, one of the biggest figures in American rocket science. A nerd that was obsessed with mysticism and the magician, Aleister Crowley, in his younger years. You think that came to a halt in adult years and career life? Hell no. He&#39;d chant the Hymn to Pan at rocket launch, along with other Thelemite rituals.</p>

<p>If I become a big time politician later in life, you think I&#39;m gonna stop holding absurdist grill-out parties, where we wear goat masks and eat extra bloody steaks to freak out my neighbors. I damn well won&#39;t. The fact that some Alex Jones-type person might witness it, and immediately think its some big political conspiracy, makes me want to do it that much more.</p>

<p>Investigate it, scrutinize them over weird behavior, and who knows, maybe you&#39;ll find some legitimate wrong-doing. It&#39;s better to investigate and be wrong, than to let scumbags slide by. But please, PLEASE, just remember that people are just people, whether they&#39;re young, old, rich, poor, loners, or socialites. Sometimes they have edgy or niche interests, but just because Old Rich McGee holds a satanic birthday party with a baby cake, doesn&#39;t make him a criminal. He could just be an old bastard who knows how to party.</p>
