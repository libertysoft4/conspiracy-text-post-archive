        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I believe Kanye was taken, forcefully reprogrammed and on a bunch of meds now. He was taken a shortly after giving a 20+ minute rant against the establishment, Hillary Clinton, Facebook, Google, and Obama for fake news and algorithm manipulation.<br/>
Full 20 minute speech:
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKoe_GteC2I">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKoe_GteC2I</a></p>

<p>In that speech he believed that people including his former friend Jay Z who aligned himself with Hillary, would assassinate him or attempt it.</p>

<p>He was admitted by his doctor while at his trainers home. His trainer was questioned after Kanye was forcibly taken by police, handcuffed to a gurney. This was his interview 
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykjKEATjCDU">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykjKEATjCDU</a></p>

<p>The hospital he was taken to, Resnick psychiatric is owned by Lynda and Stewart Resnick. They own companies including The Wonderful Company, POM Wonderful and FIJI Water brands, the Teleflora floral wire service company, Wonderful Pistachios, and other businesses.. The hospital itself has mixed reviews.</p>

<p>They&#39;re were included in a &quot;top donors&quot; list I found in Wikileaks Podesta e-mails. (top link in the xls document) <a href="https://search.wikileaks.org/?q=stewart+resnick">https://search.wikileaks.org/?q=stewart+resnick</a> </p>

<p>&quot; Here is the list of top $1M + prospects. I have sent it before, but it seems you never get it. please let me know that you received it.&quot; This was in regards to the donor list to Podesta, Resnicks are in the xls attachment.

<p>Of course they&#39;d take Kanye forcefully to a hospital funded by Hillary&#39;s billionaire friends after speaking out. Not to mention, Lynda is godmother to Ariana Huffington of the Huffington Post&#39;s daughter.
The Resnicks have been called evil people by various independent journalists for their greed.

<p>None of the Kardashians asked for prayers or positive support on twitter etc. for Kanye (makes me think they&#39;re in on it). When Lamar Odom went to the hospital they asked everyone to pray for him. The Kardashian clan largely supported Clinton over Trump other than Caitlyn Jenner. Kendall had an interview in which she was asked if she was praying for Kanye. She says yes, but her body language is uncomfortable and suggests otherwise.  </p>

<p>He looks drugged up to me. </p>

<p>I&#39;d also like to point out Kim hasn&#39;t done anything since the Paris robbing. </p>

<p>The Paris robbing happened after the media told stories about Caitlyn Jenner trying to get Kim to vote for trump. The illuminati can&#39;t have that. So they fucking &quot;robbed&quot; her and Kanye got fucking woke and pissed and spoke and got locked up.</p>

<p>If you&#39;re a black man in Hollywood/&#39;music you get treated like shit for speaking the truth.</p>

<p>Michael Jackson, prince, Tupac, biggie, dmx, Kat Williams, Dave chapelle. </p>

<p>I&#39;m praying Kanye will get woke again </p>

<p>&quot;most men with nefarious intentions such as hurting / robbing Kim Kardashian would, given the opportunity also rape her, circumstances permitting&quot;.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>well in any case, were discussing the 2nd point. </p>

<p>what the poster thinks about peoples choices or preferences in non criminal / violent situations is not really part of the topic / conspiracy. </p>

<p>nor am i interested tbh in discussing it, its their problem / point / issue / thoughts.  were discussing the actions of the criminally motivated actions against Kim that day. </p>

<p>but then again - who knows. maybe nothing even happened and it was all stage.</p>

<p>on the other hand ive heard that all of Kanyes staff were actually killed - hence no video evidence leaked. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The problem with that is he/she said the majority of men, if they had her in a room, wouldn&#39;t just tie her up. We already know their intentions are nefarious due to the fact they robbed her and held her against her will. </p>

<p>Why do I think murderers or hard core criminals won&#39;t stoop to that? Some will. The type who want to send a message or when you have a rapist that fits one of the four rapist types will. However, these things are not applicable to all criminals. In addition, if you&#39;re there to get in and get out, or your entire plan is to get the money and not get caught, then committing another Type 1 crime, that will leave trace evidence linking you to the crime, is a big no no. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree. I suppose I was kind of playing devils advocate because OP made a good post. </p>

<p>I bet the percentage of men who would commit a rape is higher when the pool is all robbers, but probably still not a majority. OP check your friends, you guys may be degenerates. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah that would make sense. This guy seems to be saying the majority of guys would be willing to do both. If you care little enough about hurting and traumatizing someone to tie them up I can see it being a shortish jump to rape.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah. I mean presuming this writer isn&#39;t completely autistic (no disrespect just realism) I doubt he poses this question to every man he meets.

    <div class="md"><p>There&#39;s probably selection bias that leads to you getting so many responses like that, probably selection bias that makes the idea to me so unthinkable. I&#39;m not arguing with you about whether it happened or not, and I am totally willing to entertain the possibility that most men are would-be rapists if you (presumably a man) are telling me that, but I gotta say I really highly doubt it. I know men are statistically more likely to commit violence and rape but I just fundamentally believe in their humanity...other men reading this please tell me if you think this guy&#39;s assessment is on point, it would shake my view of my fellow human beings but I guess if it&#39;s inaccurate it needs to be shaken.</p>

<p>This reminds me of when theists say &quot;you need religion to provide a moral code and enforcement&quot; and then others (like myself) respond &quot;you mean you&#39;d seriously hurt other people if you thought you could get away with it?&quot; to which the answer is usually &quot;of course not&quot;. Which, you know, obviously no one&#39;s going to say &quot;yep I&#39;d be out there raping and murdering like there&#39;s no tomorrow&quot;...but I still kinda believed most people wouldn&#39;t actually want to enact serious violence on others even if they could.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Imo the fact that you&#39;re mostly talking to men with an interest in BDSM definitely affects the responses you&#39;re getting. Even if someone is a sub/dom they&#39;re really two sides of the same coin (there&#39;s a little bit of switch in most of us). I think it goes without saying that people who are already into mixing sex and violence/power play would be more into this.</p>

<p>There was never a &quot;socio-economic meaning&quot; behind the word. The word &quot;nigger&quot; wasn&#39;t just some term someone made up for poor people and then was later applied to all blacks.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Ok, let&#39;s ask the Irish about slavery. Let&#39;s see if over 20 million Irish died while being brought here against their own free will. In addition, let&#39;s see if the Irish have an infrastructure in Ireland that they could fall back on today. The black man does know what the white man, the Mayans, the Natives, etc knows. The black man knows no real identity or culture. The Irish you mentioned? They know their culture and can trace it back to generations regardless of how poor they were. The Natives? Despite the hardships they endure they still have some type of connection to their roots and culture. Now let&#39;s look at blacks in the U.S. and see if the same holds true. What culture do blacks have that is their own? What infrastructure do blacks have or can rely on outside of this country?</p>

</blockquote>

<p>So if it&#39;s not about the haves and have nots, then why are you talking about socio-economics and comparing and contrasting different groups?</p>

You&#39;re ignorant regarding the continuous disenfranchisement they have suffered yet place the blame on &quot;black communities&quot;.

<p>Um, I just did.  I claimed you didn&#39;t believe in space, you lied and said there wasn&#39;t evidence for that, then I backed up my claim.  Again, are there multiple people running your account?  How do you explain not remembering something from a week ago?</p>

<p>If you need evidence about your ignorance regarding indentured servitude vs. slavery I would suggest reading Irish historian Liam Hogan&#39;s piece: <a href="https://medium.com/@Limerick1914/the-imagery-of-the-irish-slaves-myth-dissected-143e70aa6e74#.n96i069bt">https://medium.com/@Limerick1914/the-imagery-of-the-irish-slaves-myth-dissected-143e70aa6e74#.n96i069bt</a> .

<p>Goes to me clearly stating my opinion, up to today. I never said space isn&#39;t real, just perhaps not how we&#39;ve been told, same with ET&#39;s. My Opinion. I think space is different, along with ET&#39;s. I think they are inter-dimensional beings... If so, space would have to not exist, as we know it.. Damn, you&#39;re pretty daft.

<p>i&#39;ve said before that i thought the K&#39;s might seek a way to &quot;get rid of him&quot;, if anything negatively effected their cash flow. have read that Kim doesn&#39;t want to say anything about splitting, as she wants him to &quot;get better&quot; (<em>first</em>). </p>

    <div class="md"><p>And there&#39;s the cuck. I&#39;m just saying you could convince a lot more people to join your cause if you weren&#39;t so childish about it. 
So I&#39;ll bite; I stand by the art of Biljana Djurdjevic because, as a fellow artist I think her paintings portray a lot of pain and suffering in a way only a Serbian who was likely affected by Clinton&#39;s war could react to what has happened in her country. Are you asking that we start banning and burning art because the pieces fit into some six degrees of Kevin Bacon theory that some collector who might be a pedo likes the art because he likes to see tortured children? I can like her art for the quality and message. I&#39;m not getting a boner from it. Are you? It&#39;s funny that you&#39;re here on a forum that stands for free speech yet you&#39;re got some kind of attitude against it. Do you believe Biljana Djurdjevic was commissioned to do these pieces for Podesta as wank material or perhaps he happened to collect her work because she&#39;s a renowned artist? Art is an expression and Biljana Djurdjevic&#39;s art is a reflection of a world torn apart by circumstances that arose thanks to American intervention in her country. Part of that result is human trafficking, torture, and crime. If you&#39;re to say we are no longer allowed as human&#39;s to express that pain through art you need to push your fascist agenda further. Maybe it&#39;ll stick</p>

<p>As I will continue to say to deaf ears. I am all for having a civil discussion about ALL of these theories but if you&#39;re only agenda is to come here and be accusatory and childish about it, why waste your energy?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Wow how did this get into a rape post?</p>

<p>In one of the videos during his rant someone is trying to pull him off the stage and he&#39;s trying hard to not let it happen which is odd. Everything he said was real shit. Not crazy IMO. So wtf? OP I&#39;ve been wondering why myself the whole Kanye thing was so strange cause I&#39;m not a big Kanye fan but this was some crazy stuff that went down. To bad we will never know what truly happened when he was sent to the hospital because it couldn&#39;t have been from his rant which was pure sanity for once. </p>

<p>I do like how someone commented and linked the robbery to when Kim came out confused if she should go for Trump after speaking to Bruce/Caitlyn. Never thought of that. Can anyone source the timeline cause that would make this story much more interesting. </p>

<p>I do think Kanye got woke with everything going on with the election. Someone slipped him the woke pill. (Woke pill to me is not like the red pill but someone woken up to what they call conspiracies) I&#39;m impressed with this actually cause I used to just think Kanye is an egomaniac dipshit musical genius. </p>

<p>Best Kaney quote ever &quot;It&#39;s a new world Hillary! Google lied to you! Facebook lied to you!&quot;</p>

<p>I do not think he meant in his rant that Jay Z was really gunna kill him. He said &quot;J I know you got killaz don&#39;t send them at my head&quot;. So don&#39;t fuck with my head and shit see Jay Z and Dash made this kid called Yeezus so if Jay Z wanted too he could kill his career. </p>

<p>Now onto the Trump meeting today. In one of Kanye&#39;s twitter rants he wanted Facebook CEO to fund him cause (in kanyes words) &quot;I have the vision bro&quot;. He thinks he can changed the world I guess one good album and a sucky runway show at a time is not enough or some shit. Anywho Zuckerberg wouldn&#39;t give him money so now he&#39;s on to Trump cause well I guess he thought &quot;It&#39;s a new world Zuckerberg&quot; and Trump is where the money is. </p>

<p>Look the guy is a musical genius and getting the word out about the fuckery happening is great coming from someone the people will listen too the only problem is people only want to listen to his music and not his mouth run but can&#39;t blame a brother for trying right? </p>

<p>Just my 2 cents sorry it&#39;s so long. Hell he could just be a nut job but his rant was the truth. So it got me interested. He sure does look drives out now though for sure. </p>

<p>He asks her how everyone&#39;s doing, she volunteers the stuff about praying. She looks slightly awkward but that&#39;s to be expected when an interviewer&#39;s inquiring about a family member who&#39;s just been forcibly hospitalized in a psych ward. I like your theory otherwise, nice work.</p>
