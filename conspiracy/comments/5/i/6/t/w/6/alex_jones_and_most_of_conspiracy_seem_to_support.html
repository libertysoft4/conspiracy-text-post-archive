    <div class="md"><p>Trump said he was going to drain the swamp. He also said he was going to destroy the establishment. So far he has done nothing but fill it with Globalists and pro-establishment figures. Lets take a look at a few of them...  </p>

<p>Commerce: Wilbur Ross - Former managing director of Rothschild Inc. and a former senior adviser to Rothschild family members. Saved Trump from bankruptcy in the late 1980&#39;s.  </p>

<p>Sectary of state: Rex Tillerson - outgoing chairman of ExxonMobil after 41 years with the energy giant. Has a history of close business ties to Russian president Vladimir Putin, who bestowed the Order of Friendship on Tillerson in 2013.  </p>

<p>Treasury: Steven Mnuchin - Former Goldman Sachs, hedge funder and Hollywood producer (Sully, American Sniper, The Legend of Tarzan). Son of Goldman Sachs employee, Yale grad. Swooped on doomed IndyMac bank as it sunk in the 2008 housing crash, acquired it and scored when the federal government bailed out the bank.  </p>

<p>The above people still refer to the middle and lower class as peasants. They, along with Trump, are all billionaires. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh, I agree that he does not &#39;give a single fuck about it&#39;, as you put it.  </p>

<p>Though citizens of the United states should. They thought they were getting an anti-establishment/anti-globalist candidate that was going to bring about real change and reform.  </p>

<p>Instead they got a puppet president who has filled his cabinet with some of the most dangerous men in the world. Men, whom for a long time, have been working toward what is commonly referred to as the new world order.  </p>

<p>In case you don&#39;t recognise those names. The above three men have also attended Bilderberg conferences. That should be enough to make people question their allegiances to the globalist movement aka the establishment.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>When it comes to geo-politics, nothing is ever simple.  </p>

<p>As for Hilary itching for war on US soil? I don&#39;t think so. I&#39;m happy to be proven wrong here and genuinely interested in reading more about this.  </p>

<p>Trump&#39;s actions so far are going to make Hilary&#39;s corruption seem pale in comparison... and he hasn&#39;t even hopped in the big chair yet!  </p>

<p>As for Trumps buildings - Imagine the insurance policies Trump has for each of his businesses. In fact, I would not be surprised if one of his own buildings gets destroyed in a bombing by &#39;foreign terrorists&#39;. Could be a great way to pave the path for a new war on foreign soil.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You make no sense. The people weren&#39;t appointed by the media but by Trump himself. Also the, &#39;everything is fake on the media&#39; cop out is already used by the majority of this sub. I&#39;m not saying that MSM is truthful, because it certainly isn&#39;t, but isn&#39;t it a bit too easy to just say &#39;everything is fake&#39;? This sub has lost its flair ever since the Trump shills came flooding in.</p>

<p>Also, it wasn&#39;t either Trump or HRC, there were enough third party members. People here act like they know and see through everything, but then go on debating Reps vs Dems, which are the two sides of the same damn coin.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Right, and there is no way that Trump was lying right. Just like Trump never invited establishment people and bankers into his cabinet, amirite? The US will be involved in another war by 2020, I guarantee it. That&#39;s how the US military complex makes its money, it&#39;s not going to change. Just like it didn&#39;t change in the last 50 years.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not bitching about politics, but the fuckfest some people made this sub into. I&#39;m not saying that all people on this sub are involved, but a great part of this sub just engages in Trump circle jerks, while completely ignoring the facts. That&#39;s not discussing politics, that&#39;s being a sheeple and a retard.</p>

<p>Lastly, I&#39;m not even from the US (and boy am I happy I&#39;m not), so you don&#39;t have to tell me to go somewhere else.</p>

<p>the attitude here is that pizzagate has to be 2000% true because team of Random people from the Internet &quot;did the research&quot; and found some &quot;funny sounding&quot; emails that mention Food, and decided it couldn&#39;t be anything at all except code for child trafficking, yet theres was no interest when the people who real intelligence work, say there may be evidence of foreign influence in our election, why we waste time discussing it?  pizzagate has to be real because people on the Internet said so, while Russia influencing our election has to be fake because actual intelligence agencies said so, let that sink in for a min............. </p>

<p>seriously, you say everyone is welcomed, but It seems a like this page has become less concerned about discussing conspiracies lately, and more about specifically attacking one single side of the political spectrum......</p>

<p>And maybe I&#39;m wrong but I feel like this page use to try and do quasi-legitimate independent investigations, into things that were actually plausible; and but now it feels like that same cult is on a witch hunt for the other side, I was all for people picking through those leaked emails, I wasn&#39;t gonna do it, I have a life and better shit do with my time but I felt like someone needed to do it, that changed when  they couldn&#39;t find anything  juicy, so they just started making shit up....... look, if you have what like 60k+ emails from one relatively small group of people, of course you&#39;ll be able to find certain topics that normal people talk about with their friends &amp;amp;co-workers,  things like idk maybe food? I bet they talk about meetings a lot too, what could that be code for? Maybe every time someone makes &quot;weekend plans&quot; that&#39;s secret code for something also? This was so obviously b/s that was intentionally crafted to make absolutely nothing sound like the most vile shit possible, and as long as it&#39;s about a democrat everyone will accept it as gospel, and parade it around as undeniable proof......</p>

<p>Trumped tweeted about a taco bowls earlier this year? Is that his coded way of saying they sell Mexican child sex slaves trump tower? Or was that just about taco bowls? I think it 110% has to be code, or what about the pictures of Him and Sarah palin at a pizza place together!!!.... they had to of been been finalizing a child slave deal, why else would they be at a pizza place?! Let me guess they were simply eating a slice of pizza?? Yea right that&#39;s what they want you to think, </p>

<p>This page is already fighting an uphill battle being r/conspiracy, but it losing its last shreds of credibility  because of a certain political cult turning it into its private political weapon, I honestly can&#39;t come on here anymore and expect to read anything interesting anymore,  just that democrats want to sell everyone&#39;s kids into sex slavery before they blow up the world....
Seriously, Im sorry for the long winded rant but /conspiracy needs to figure out a way to at least mix up the post a little or something because it&#39;s it&#39;s just basically alt-right propaganda machine at his point </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is an idiotic way to ask the question, honestly, since absolutely no one is supporting Trump because of some cult of personality. Trump is the only political figure in modern times that has threatened the power that the establishment has had over basically all aspects of national policy. He has revealed just how marginal the support for their rule truly is and also called out the media for being nothing but a dishonest propaganda machine. </p>

<p>The question is not about supporting Trump, by itself, but if he can deliver on at least some of his promises. </p>

<p>Trump policies, such as restoring our borders, are huge attacks on the globalist agenda. </p>

<p>Not going to war in Syria, huge blow to the neocon globalist agenda. </p>

<p>Not having conflictive relations with Russia, huge blow to the globalist agenda. </p>

<p>That&#39;s why the establishment hates him. </p>

<p>So you should stop thinking in terms of &#39;love or hate Trump.&#39; Also, mmost of the people that work on Wall Street are not part of the NWO, though they work without its basic logic and institutions. Trump is a billionaire, but not part of the NWO. </p>

<p>The NWO is a faction of very wealthy individuals, particularly those who control the central banks, who dominate governmental policy and culture --though education and media. They are not all or most of the wealthy. </p>

<p>A lot of the support from Trump comes from very wealthy individuals who know the game is rigged, not just against the average person, but against wealthy people who are not members of the club and not part of the agenda. Get it? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I disagree completely. I absolutely think he&#39;s part of it. I would venture to say they would rather him in than Clinton. He&#39;s filled his cabinet with billionaires and will certainly make a lot of people richer. That, to me, would be absurd to overlook.</p>

<p>Also, Bernie was much more threatening to the establishment and still is. Trump is the establishment. If you don&#39;t think that there is any trace of cult of personality in his followers, I don&#39;t know what to tell you, bruv. His entire campaign was soaked in it. </p>

<p>I mean you said it yourself, the central banks are in control. If you don&#39;t think he&#39;s had dealings with them, again, I&#39;m at a loss. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Here&#39;s the problem: you are too paranoid, you give the NWO too much credit. You think they are some interdimensional beings with some kind of power beyond those of simple men. They are not. </p>

<p>If you are going to use the Establishment, please give me a definition of what the establishment is? Like, what does it actually mean? </p>

<p>If Trump is the establishment, show me specififically how he is, as oppose to just saying &#39;he&#39;s rich.&#39; All rich people are part of the establishment. </p>

<p>Yes, I mentioned the central banks. What is the purposse and goal of the central banks? And in what way is Trump either playing to them or going against them? </p>

<p>The central banks are not abstract principles or institutions, they are vehicles that express very specific interest and policies. So, elaborate on what you mean if you actually want to have a meaningful exchange. </p>

<p>So you think that everything in politics is theater, scripted and preplanned. But you know what you do then, you give up your own ability to shape your world. </p>

<p>The fact that you think they would go to the trouble of putting Trump into office over Clinton shows tells me you are just dealing in conspiracy theory and not paying attention to actual facts. </p>

<p>How does Trump benefit them? More and more people are awake to the manipulations of the media, to the divisive and rule policies of the elite. The elite are now ruling without the tacit and passive consent they once had. </p>

<p>The American people are now harder to control. As are the British after Brexit. Hell, the EU thought it would secure its power with the immigration crisis, but that&#39;s actually going to be its undoing. </p>

<p>The elites have made a number of enormous miscalculations. </p>

<p>Bernie was never a threat to the establishment. You know how I know that? Bernie didn&#39;t even have the guts to stand up for a fair election within the Democratic party. You think this push over, who allows Hillary to rig the election, has the guts to go after the true power elites in the country? Please. </p>

<p>Bernie is just a professor type, a coffee house moralist who likes to be in the spot light, likes to say nice things, and push the political process towards a more humane direction. But a revolutionary? Absolutely not. His own actions prove my point completely. </p>

<p>Trump has far bigger balls than any other political figure I&#39;ve ever seen in the US. Ever. </p>

<p>Trump is not trying to completely remake the world or the US, he&#39;s trying to restore some of the fundamental practices that made this country a true country and one that was prosperous. </p>

<p>Every charasmatic leader has a &#39;cult of personality.&#39; He becomes the embodiment of the hopes and aspirations of the people. In a very real way, Trump is no more a &#39;cult like figure&#39; than Obama was when he first won. But Obama was only a plastic, marketed produced prophet who could not even pick his own cabinet members. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Did you just tell someone on /conspiracy that they are too paranoid? I&#39;m not saying you&#39;re wrong but could i start doing that on any of the Hillary or DNC post here? it&#39;s getting ridiculous that anytime trump is brought up in a negative tone, of sudden the trump cult shows up to belittle anyone that questions anything, and insist they are, as you put it, &quot;too paranoid&quot; since when was this page suppose to be an extension of t_d?  I was under the impression this page was suppose to be a relatively non-partisan page? if you like Donald good for you, congrats on the win, but how about sticking to the DNC related conspiracies, I won&#39;t come in and tell you you&#39;re being &quot;too paranoid&quot;, but for those of us that don&#39;t like trump, let us have our discussions about trump, he is about to be president and does do things in a very different way that most of us haven&#39;t seen, we don&#39;t need you telling us how OUR conspiracies are simply excessive paranoia.........it seriously feels like every page that use to be worth a shit on Reddit is being brigaded by this cult......... </p>

    <div class="md"><p>(See name). I am an enthusiastic trump supporter, in fact went to see him yesterday in wisc. I also like alex jones. So take this with a grain of salt, if you like.  Im tired of globalist and special interests controlling the masses. Its a rigged system.   My personal opinion is trump is just surrounding himself with the best and the brightest in their fields to make america great again. Too legit drain the swamp AND unleash american energy. My personal feelings is global cooling/global warming/climate change is a hoax. A terrible one at that for power, creed, control and global interest. To stifle american production while foreign competition strives. Also, through green initiatives the government now regulates (controls) food, transportation, resources and even private property. Imo, theres no greater threat to the US and the world than fake news and the climate change hoax. Though, not directly related, they are both to serve a greater purpose of power and controlling the people. Im all for being good to the planet, also love the idea of newer technologies, but i am pragmatic and suspicious for the intentions of a lot of these people. </p>

<p>The exxon choice i took as a really successful businessman that knows the business really well. Trump has been really upfront about &quot;unleashing&quot; american energy. Gas, oil, clean coal. Very open about this and the crowds go wild when he talks about it. So the people are excited, too. Im very suspicious of the media and the pile on. Like washpo owned by amazon&#39;s Jeff Bezo, who stands to lose money if trump goes after china trade. Amazons no online tax and import of chinese goods, theres serious money at stake. So, washpo has been putting out hit piece after hit piece. A similar thing with NYT. Carlos Slims owns shares in NYT and saved them from bankruptcy with a $150million loan. It is said the average mexican cant go a day without buying a carlos slim product in mexico and a lot of the money being spent comes from people sending it home from the US. Anyways....</p>

<p>People have underestimated Trump at every step of this election. All the bankers and world elites hate trump. They do. Forbes top 100 ceo&#39;s are never trumpers. The hollywood, banking, media establishment have fought him every step of the way and continue to do so, besides kanye, of all people. I think Trump is filling his cabinet with people with the know with all and the best sharks america has to offer. A glorious time. Until theres reason to be suspect, im not gonna be alarmed. Stay frosty, but bare in mind the enormous amount of power trying to take him down, including the CIA, ffs. </p>
