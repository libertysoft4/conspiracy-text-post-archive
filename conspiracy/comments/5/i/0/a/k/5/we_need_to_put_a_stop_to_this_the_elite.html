<p>Newspeak is a fictional language itself, and is much more complex. The idea behind newspeak is to create a <strong>new</strong> language which only allows communication so that people can work, but not articulate (and therefore develop) ideas that are anti-party. It is to strip down the soul from the human language so that people can only use it for performing mundane duties.</p>

<p>I&#39;m sure there are some pedophiles who are elites. I mean, there are pedophiles at every level in society. The ones who are elite can get away with it. There&#39;s even decent evidence that there are &quot;rings&quot; of pedos among the elites. </p>

<p>There just isn&#39;t any evidence that it&#39;s going on in the damn pizza shop. All the &#39;proof&#39; being posted is that they have some mildly weird art that isn&#39;t even that weird in the scope of modern art. It&#39;s tamer than a Marilyn Manson video. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>So you&#39;re definitely agreeing, yet for some reason trying to normalise, that there are paedo rings among the elite, but still somehow missing the point of pizzagate. No, of course Hillary Clinton isn&#39;t raping, murdering, and eating babies in the basement of Comet all in the name of Moloch. That&#39;s the dumb fucking narrative that the MSM says pizzagate believers believe. Comet is obviously tied in with the paedo ring in DC, and James Alefantis is definitely a high roller in the ring. The pizza places are just a front on which to launder money through, while giving easy opportunity to speak in code through innocent pizza terminology. Pizzagate extends far past that though. It&#39;s a global blackmail ring to make sure that those who are in power, and are wanted in power by those &quot;behind the scenes&quot; (big oil, banks, Rothschilds, Rockefeller, Soros et al.) shall stay in power. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, I am not agreeing. </p>

<p>I agree there are pedos in the world. Some are bound to be elites. </p>

<p>Where I <em>stop</em> agreeing is the point at which you condemn people of being pedos without any proof. That&#39;s unfair, immature, and downright silly. It makes you look like a nutjob, and you&#39;re trying to ruin some person&#39;s life based on wild conjecture. THIS BS HAS ALREADY LEAD TO A MAN GOING INTO THE BUSINESS WITH A MACHINE GUN TO KILL THEM. It&#39;s time for you guys to shut up and grow up. </p>

<p>What&#39;s lacking is proof. There is NO proof. You have some mildly creepy art - but so what? That&#39;s basically every hipster food joint on earth. Have you ever been outside? Have you ever been to an art museum? That&#39;s what artists do. It&#39;s like heavy metal musicians and television. Shocking stuff sells. </p>

<p>You&#39;re just like the old ladies in the 80&#39;s and 90&#39;s who claimed that all rock and roll bands were the work of the devil. You&#39;re creating links where none exist. </p>

<p>I totally can believe that there are powerful people who blackmail each other with stuff like child sex. Just like the CIA blackmails their enemies by putting CP on people&#39;s computers. But that doesn&#39;t mean I can just point to anyone I dislike and claim they are part of it. YOU HAVE TO HAVE EVIDENCE. And by evidence, I mean more than just &quot;if you remove 5 letters from his name and add 2 more, it says something in another language that sounds like something a pedo would say&quot;. Or that you can find a logo that has one or two things in common with the child love logo or whatever. </p>

<p>Look at the Trump/Pence logo. It&#39;s a T penetrating a P. Does that mean they are secretly a cabal of transgender/pedo sex ring? Or maybe it&#39;s just a T and a P for Trump and Pence. And the Comet Ping Pong logo is two ping pong paddles. Look at <a href="http://www.channel-one.al/wp-content/uploads/845.jpg">Trump&#39;s apartment</a> - there&#39;s a statue of underage looking girls making out. There is a flower sculpture with four leaves that looks as much like the butterfly pedo symbol as the Ping Pong logo. Are you ready to admit <em>he&#39;s</em> the leader of a satanic pedo ring now? There&#39;s every bit as much proof as there is that Alefantis is. </p>

<p>These are REAL PEOPLE whose lives you are trying to ruin. Reddit already did this with the Boston Marathon bombing. Then did it again with that daycare center. One of you idiots already showed up with a fucking machine gun at Comet Ping Pong. </p>

<p>You have to use logic and rationality when talking about conspiracies, or you make us look exactly like what they say we are to discredit us - wackos who will believe absolutely anything that follows a chosen narrative. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re missing the point. Still. But first off, let me just mention that that guy who went into comet with a machine gun (while the only traffic camera watching the place conveniently wasn&#39;t there), who never even fired the weapon - he is not a pizzagate investigator. He&#39;s just another one of America&#39;s conditioned masses who read a bit about pizzagate from some shitty sources, and based on an emotional reaction went there himself to put a scare into James Alefantis. Either that or it was a false flag. (orchestrate a near disaster situation, blame it on fake news, and voila - you&#39;ve got the people asking for Internet censorship like it was their idea the whole time. Classic honey pot.)<br/>
Anyone seriously investigating this isn&#39;t focused on the anagram of a name in another language. No. That&#39;s stupid. Anyone who really researches it looks into actions and history of Clinton Global Initiative (CGI) and the Clinton Foundation (CF). We look at their donors, who lobbies for them, where they are active, etc, and follow trends in those areas and of those people who associate with them. We look at the continuing increasing number of missing children in Haiti, where CGI operate and have done for now decades. We look at how many children go missing from poorer states like Virginia and also in DC. Those two places have some of the highest rates of missing children in america.<br/>
Also, yes I would very well accept that trump is leading the paedo ring if sufficient evidence came to light that would suggest so. But so far it hasn&#39;t. We don&#39;t even know who is the &quot;ring leader&quot; or if there is only one. But we can name those who are in high positions and seem to have the most to lose by being involved in this. Would you suggest that everyone stops investigating and we just go back to mindless life as the system says we should live while they carry on doing what they do under a veil of secrecy? Or would you suggest a full, formal investigation and to get to the very bottom of it. Politicians are not above the law. Politicians are public servants. They should work for us, so therefore we have a right to know if they are following the laws they write. Here comes a classic: if they have nothing to hide then they should have nothing to fear. It&#39;s the line they&#39;ve used on us countless times to slowly break down our privacy rights and give the governments permission to spy on us for their own benefit. Well we the people believe everyone should be treated equally. So now it&#39;s our turn and now we deserve to see what they do behind closed doors. If it&#39;s really nothing and it turns out these people are just useless at their job - kick them out of office. If they turn out to be the paedos they&#39;re currently shaping up to appear as - may God have mercy on them. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>True, and it should be under construction now.</p>

<p>U.S. Senators Rob Portman (R-OH) and Chris Murphy (D-CT) today announced that their Countering Disinformation and Propaganda Act – legislation designed to help American allies counter foreign government propaganda from Russia, China, and other nations – has passed the Senate as part of the FY 2017 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) Conference Report. The bipartisan bill, which was introduced by Senators Portman and Murphy in March, will <strong>improve the ability of the United States to counter foreign propaganda and disinformation by establishing an interagency center housed at the State Department to coordinate and synchronize counter-propaganda efforts throughout the U.S. government.</strong> To support these efforts, the bill also creates a grant program for NGOs, think tanks, civil society and other experts outside government who are engaged in counter-propaganda related work. This will better leverage existing expertise and empower local communities to defend themselves from foreign manipulation.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Constitution are not worth the paper their are written on when the power is in private hands that do not have to abide by it. People on Reddit are very quick to remind everyone that Reddit, Facebook or Twitter filtering stuff is not an attack on free speech because they are free to do what they want with their product.</p>

<p>While everyone was so busy worrying about their governments, about their constitutions, they forgot to look at the real threat of our time, the corporations. They make their own rules, they operate on fascist principle and the general population is ready to defend their right to do so. </p>

<p>Governments have not been in power since WW1, corporations have, yet nobody is looking at them seriously because we&#39;ve all be told they have the right to do as they please. They break law, they ravage the environment, they cause death, they sponsor wars, with no accountability for anyone. </p>

<p>I for one am tired of people fighting the wrong enemy, governments are a mirage at best, a tool made by corporations to give an illusion of freedom to the general population. Trying to fight corporations with governments is like trying to stop a fire with more fire, ain&#39;t gonna work (I am aware of the edge cases of stopping fires with explosions, though that could still apply...).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Disinformation causes people to hurt themselves.  That&#39;s unconsititonal because per the very beginning sentence of the constitution--the preamble--a social contract between citizens to abide by it is formed, and therefore the constittuion&#39;s jurisdiction is based upon popular sovereignty.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>We the People of the United States, in Order to form a more perfect Union, establish <strong>Justice</strong>, insure <strong>domestic Tranquility</strong>, provide for the <strong>common defence</strong>, promote the <strong>general Welfare</strong>, and <strong>secure the Blessings of Liberty</strong> to ourselves and our <strong>Posterity</strong>, do ordain and establish this Constitution for the United States of America.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Therefore I can tell you that disinfo does the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>It inhibits Justice, if people don&#39;t know what the truth is, or have been given counterfactual information or have been inhibited from facts.</li>
<li>Disinfo in the form of making riots, disasters, slayings bigger than they are to sensationalize or manipulate people has the effect of <strong><em>greatly undermining domestic tranquility</em></strong></li>
<li>Disinfo makes us much less safe because it manufactures consent for WAR, which then only causes more TERRORISM later.</li>
<li>Disinfo destroys the common good (general welfare) because it causes neighbor to go to war with neighbor, it causes racebaiting, genderbaiting, trannybaiting, bigotry, anger, hostility, infighting, militiamaking, cultmaking and other forms of social tension.</li>
<li>Disinfo destroys the posterity of americans because people learn incorrect information and pass it down generationally, injuring their children&#39;s success in making wise, cautious, informed decisions.  Disinfo screws up education, history, and ruins our connection to the past, and without a past there is no future.</li>
</ul>

<p>I&#39;ve satisfactorily demonstrated all the ways that disinformation is injurious to the public.  Any government that thinks it is legitimate can guess again.  I do not abide or respect any law that legalizes disinformation.  I will not accept it because I believe it to be against the highest law of the land and prima facie violation of common law and popular sovereignty.</p>

<p>I always thought my dad sounded like a crazy lunatic. I was a liberal. He wanted Trump. He called Hillary Satan, etc, told me American news is propaganda and try to smear Russia. I didn&#39;t listen. After pizzagate, I went up to him and told him Hillary Clinton is as close to Satan as she can possibly wake up. And in Russian he was like &quot;OH REALLY&quot;. </p>

<p>No guys it&#39;s real. They&#39;re trying so hard to blame Russia for swaying the election. If anything their hackers found Kiddy Porn on the Democratic Party and have known for years, that&#39;s why they probably don&#39;t let Americans adopt from Russia. If they spoke about it before Trump won, a war against Russia would&#39;ve started. Clinton would&#39;ve loved that. I&#39;ve really opened my eyes since this investigation. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You know that scene in Princess Bride where the intelligent bad guy kept saying &quot;Inconceivable!&quot;? You say &quot;They can&#39;t censor...&quot; and I wonder the same thing the Dred Pirate Roberts wondered, Perhaps you do not know the meaning of CAN&#39;T because the THEYs of this world can and do whatever THEY want. Unfortunately. I agree with your basic premise, however, and think enough is enough.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You are indeed mistaken. The constitution had been suspended in 2001 following the attack. The sitting president has continued suspension. Furthermore, despite laws no longer being enforceable, laws were passed allowing use of propaganda. This is done for public perception and to provide basis for unjust prosecution (despite the fact that laws aren&#39;t legally enforceable under continuity plan). They are pushing more now along the faux news line. Sure, you and I, and every other citizen will still be treated as if the constitution was in effect, but the gov gets a free pass. IMHO, the constitution cannot be suspended under any circumstance without following the procedures the constitution allows. The government is run amok. But who cares anyway? 1963 is still relevant.</p>

<p>But I suspect that this election cycle has really thrown them for a long one and they got a huge shock from the outcome despite the huge amount of money they threw at it. </p>

<p>Now they&#39;re in panic mode and realising that their grip is slipping and this damn internet thing is a real threat to them.</p>

<p>I&#39;m expecting some sort of challenge to Donald before Jan 20 comes around. They&#39;re doing their darnedest to ensure he isn&#39;t POTUS come then. I hope not because I think it could be a destabalising event if it comes to it.</p>
