    <div class="md"><p>The point is he is just as much for the &quot;little&quot; man, as is Hillary (not - leech - whore politician).

News flash,  government doesn&#39;t have money, they TAKE money. They provide/produce nothing, to the markets. So, Trump has an honest day of work by contributing wealth and development to the economy, while politicians, like Sanders steal from those creators, to redistribute.

<p>That&#39;s absurd.  You know what they provide?  They provide muscle.   Capitalism has never existed without a strong state to protect the robber barons.

<p>Since I&#39;m not a communist I&#39;m not sure what relevance this has.   However, since you&#39;re the one defending an ideology, let&#39;s look at the atrocities of your camp.  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Overcoming amnesia, suppose we now apply the methodology of the Black Book and its reviewers to the full story, not just the doctrinally acceptable half. We therefore conclude that in India the democratic capitalist &quot;experiment&quot; since 1947 has caused more deaths than in the entire history of the &quot;colossal, wholly failed...experiment&quot; of Communism everywhere since 1917: over 100 million deaths by 1979, tens of millions more since, in India alone. The &quot;criminal indictment&quot; of the &quot;democratic capitalist experiment&quot; becomes harsher still if we turn to its effects after the fall of Communism: millions of corpses in Russia, to take one case, as Russia followed the confident prescription of the World Bank that &quot;Countries that liberalise rapidly and extensively turn around more quickly [than those that do not],&quot; returning to something like what it had been before World War I, a picture familiar throughout the &quot;third world.&quot; But &quot;you can&#39;t make an omelette without broken eggs,&quot; as Stalin would have said. The indictment becomes far harsher if we consider these vast areas that remained under Western tutelage, yielding a truly &quot;colossal&quot; record of skeletons and &quot;absolutely futile, pointless and inexplicable suffering&quot; (Ryan). The indictment takes on further force when we add to the account the countries devastated by the direct assaults of Western power, and its clients, during the same years. (Chomsky)</p>

<p>Communism is, but Capitalism is not. Capitalism requires a non-lazy populace. Both are Utopias, sure. But, one kept in check, has brought the world into where we are now. The other, simply kills millions (for the greater good - theft - usually a dictator). Free Market Capitalism is the only solution, but it requires you to not be lazy, and you (and others) seem to be. Communism requires a benevolent dictator and his/her heirs being the same. Not gonna happen. Capitalism has better recourse, Communism, not so much...</p>

<p>Again, more people died in capitalist India during a short period than every communist country in history.   The Indian state was <em>highly</em> laissez faire during this time period, taking a &quot;hands off&quot; approach to the economy.   The data simply doesn&#39;t support your utopian ideas.   The idea that &quot;hard work&quot; = success under capitalism is also laughable, since inheriting wealth is by far the most important indicator of further wealth accumulation.   There is very little social mobility in capitalist societies (ironically there is much more social mobility in capitalist-socialist hybrids like Norway).   The hardest work is done by people who are the paid the least.  </p>

<p>Communism is also utopian and leads to centralized power, social dysfunction and atrocities.   </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re thinking of the wrong time period, and, in any case, there has never been a powerful capitalist state that didn&#39;t engage in some form of imperialism or extraction from less powerful states.   </p>

<p>It&#39;s possible we&#39;re talking about two different things.   The bottom line is that I find the <em>idea</em> of a &quot;free market&quot; to be quite compelling.   Who would object to the free exchange of goods and services?   The problem, like communism, is in the execution.   </p>

<p>Take a look at the mining towns at the turn of the century US.   They are fairly similar to the hypercapitalist export zones in the third world.   Workers had no rights.   Private armies killed them or broke their legs if they tried to unionize, even just for trying to achieve a modicum of dignity or a non-starvation wage.   The judges were bought and paid for.  The school curriculum had to be approved by the local robber baron.   Doctors conspired with corporations to prevent employees from receiving damages.   Etc.  </p>

<p>Also, human nature being it what it is, capitalists are not content to rest on their laurels.  As Kropotkin wrote several hundred years ago, &quot;competition kills competition&quot;, which results in monopoly.  It is utopian to imagine that corporations not attempt to capture the state to protect their monopolies.  </p>

<p>Any actual solution is going to have to involve much more bottom up power than top town power.   When you have a few dozen plutocrats owning more wealth than billions of people that&#39;s just obscene.   It makes Ancient Egypt look like an egalitarian society.   Power corrupts.   </p>

    <div class="md"><p>So is life. Cannot have the beauty without the ugly. Socialism is not the answer. Maybe noble in cause/on paper, but it doesn&#39;t work without theft. Free market capitalism is the only true solution. But, it comes with a heavy price on the populace. We must be educated, and vigilant.</p>

<p>What is wrong with me and you trading goods, voluntarily? Why must the State be involved? They just rob both of us, and take a cut. You have a product? I have a service. We trade, voluntarily. That is all Capitalism is. I&#39;m far more generous than my &quot;Socialist&quot; acquaintances.. I make an effort to donate, and educate myself on the best charities (imo). I cannot tell you how many times I&#39;ve given 10,20,50,100 $ to a person asking on the streets. I do it, because I care, and have the means... This is different than State forced robbery, and usually that person, who needs it, never sees it...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>While I agree with some things you say, I do fear for the future of the US when capitalism reaches its limit. Just to let you in on a little secret, if Trump decides to bring back all the jobs from China, he&#39;s not going to replace all those Chinese workers with Americans. They&#39;ll most likely be robots. And the trend will only increase. Eventually, most workers will be deemed useless. It&#39;s already been seen in China (as in my case, I plan to have everything fully automated within a couple years). In fact, the US already has more automation than China, in terms of percentage. Most jobs in the US Trump has been claiming are going to Mexico and China are actually being taken by robots. When Apple starts making iPhones in the US, Trump might claim this as his &quot;victory&quot;, but that&#39;s not a victory for the people. It&#39;s a victory for Apple. We&#39;re in a whole new industrial revolution. Industry 4.0. Cool, but also scary stuff.   </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Aye, so have I, and still do. I contemplate the bigger things in life, and the more abstract. I&#39;m glad we had this convo, though. Actually turned out to be a lovely conversation (I honestly do not get many on here). It&#39;s just something to think and contemplate about. I don&#39;t think people are inherently &quot;evil&quot;, I do think there are &quot;evil&quot; people using those of us who are good, for the wrong means, by the wrongs means. Hence, Socialism. </p>

<p>I just want us all to be free. You have honey? I have some milk. Want to trade? abso.fuckin&#39;.lutely! We trade. No more needs to be known. We are private individuals. No third parties... I&#39;ll donate, with my money to actually help people. You know, that guy/gal on the corner, down on her/his luck? I&#39;ll help, my community. I know I helped. Even if she/he just gets their fix, maybe that would stop a burglary, or killing. </p>

<p>Life is funny, and we truly do not know how we help others. A smile, may just convince someone to not off themselves, later that night.  Be good, as individuals. We do not need government..</p>

<p>The Deep State is, sure. I talk about this all the time, most don&#39;t want to listen, though. It has very little, per se, to do with Israel, but Rome and the Tri-Sovereign States. Zionists, are mercenaries of Rome.. Put that in your pipe and smoke it...</p>

<p>I agree with you that it was a binary choice.  However, that doesn&#39;t mean that one must <em>like</em> turnips but rather it&#39;s possible to hate turnips just a bit less than carrots.. and still end up with something less than satisfying.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Aye, so have I, and still do. I contemplate the bigger things in life, and the more abstract. I&#39;m glad we had this convo, though. Actually turned out to be a lovely conversation (I honestly do not get many on here). It&#39;s just something to think and contemplate about. I don&#39;t think people are inherently &quot;evil&quot;, I do think there are &quot;evil&quot; people using those of us who are good, for the wrong means, by the wrongs means. Hence, Socialism. </p>

<p>I just want us all to be free. You have honey? I have some milk. Want to trade? abso.fuckin&#39;.lutely! We trade. No more needs to be known. We are private individuals. No third parties... I&#39;ll donate, with my money to actually help people. You know, that guy/gal on the corner, down on her/his luck? I&#39;ll help, my community. I know I helped. Even if she/he just gets their fix, maybe that would stop a burglary, or killing. </p>

<p>Life is funny, and we truly do not know how we help others. A smile, may just convince someone to not off themselves, later that night.  Be good, as individuals. We do not need government..</p>

<p>Peace and love :) </p>
