<p>This is probably legit: WIKILEAKS GUY TRYING TO GET THROUGH. I FINALLY FIGURED OUT WHAT IS GOING ON</p>

<blockquote>
<p>There has been a guy messaging me saying &quot;the blockchain is compromised&quot;. I assumed Bitcoin, but now I know it is Julian assanges dead man switch blockchain, for the huge releases he said he&#39;d do if anything happened. This would obviously confirm he&#39;s in trouble because he is not here to correct the breaches. Here are a few of the messages sent:
&quot;Here are the tools to get Assange&#39;s information out of the blockchain. We are about to get gagged. Or worse. Pls do the right thing. These tools won&#39;t be around for long. FULL DISCLOSURE, let the people have the truth. No matter how damming. Sir, this information is dangerous. They killed Jean, and group one is missing. We need this public asap. We need more people involved. Be safe, sir. Thank you for being a true patriot. The tools will be improved if we can.<a href="https://github.com/WikiLeaksFreedomForce">https://github.com/WikiLeaksFreedomForce</a>. And here is the bot link to the archived conversation as we built this. You will need the conversation to understand what to do. <a href="https://blargbot.xyz/logs/#3cvppr">https://blargbot.xyz/logs/#3cvppr</a> this is time sensitive. Thank you.&quot;
&quot;I hope that if you have the resources available, you have people looking into the blockchain. The massive ddos was 10/21. We have found things, and others have reported finding full files and keys. We are working on discord in the open. Members of my team have gotten gag orders, and I&#39;m sure my time is coming soon. Pls don&#39;t let this be for nothing&quot;
Also. We are unsure of if the blockchain was altered on Oct 27 2016. We have been using a local for our tests. U can find it on the darkweb. These tools... They are not perfected, but if u get your people on them. It will be more then enough to get you to the files. We still haven&#39;t combined the torrent magnets. And transmission of enclosed data seems to get people vanned. There has been multiple attempts to make this public for the past two months. Now, we have so many people doing this, I don&#39;t know if it can be stopped without shutting down the internet. This is what alot of people died for Jim. We&#39;re giving it to u first. And we will continue to share it with anyone interested. These kid fucking old guard types need to meet justice. And Julian deserves a legacy after this. The fact that his dms triggered indicates terrible things. My name is A___ K_____s. I live in Canada. I&#39;m not the one who made this, I only helped. I&#39;m not a spook. Nor a terrorist. Just a person who has had enough of the bullshit&quot;

Yes, the header could be split up, however its unlikely it would split up to the point we wouldn&#39;t be able to tell that its a header and for what file type. Past that point it doesn&#39;t matter if the rest of the data is part of the header or just normal data.

If you had a blockchain database like his, what would you query to pull up all the transactions from this example: </p>

<p>WL -&gt; SPEAKING ADDRESS -&gt; MESSASGE ADDRESSES -&gt; WL </p>

<p>We need to figure out how we can tie in the &quot;SPEAKING ADDRESS -&gt; MESSAGE ADDRESSES&quot; transaction when we pull from the database. once we do that, we will have established a method where we can pull all the transactions that have ever touched the same money as WL.</p>

I should have the list of blockchains and item numbers compiled in 3 hours time. Will include posting times and dates in case they are numerically relevant. Most notably, similar blockchain events went out over the course of november but not prior, and on any given date no more than 5 posted. Theee has not been any single date in which a release consisted of 18 blockchains, no consistency with the dates, so i dont believe this is an autogenerated script

Like if we got a random FLI header from a transaction, it makes sense that we could generate a FLI file by following the example of cablegate

If you had a blockchain database like his, what would you query to pull up all the transactions from this example: </p>

<p>WL -&gt; SPEAKING ADDRESS -&gt; MESSASGE ADDRESSES -&gt; WL </p>

<p>We need to figure out how we can tie in the &quot;SPEAKING ADDRESS -&gt; MESSAGE ADDRESSES&quot; transaction when we pull from the database. once we do that, we will have established a method where we can pull all the transactions that have ever touched the same money as WL.

<p>I would use line breaks if I could, but the list is way too long and way too many characters to post the entire thing. It&#39;s honestly to messy, I would highly recommend if you guys are interested to just head on over to it and check it out. Like I said earlier, use epic privacy browser if you want some extra protection.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The site attempts to use javascript to load the logs, im not going to spend my time parsing javascript to find out what the code is doing. Javascript is not a good idea if the guy wants this information to spread. He could easily use pastebin or a simple compressed zip file on a ftp containing all the logs.</p>

<p>You could have easily posted some of the logs with line breaks man its not hard, why are you making it complicated for us to preview this info?</p>
