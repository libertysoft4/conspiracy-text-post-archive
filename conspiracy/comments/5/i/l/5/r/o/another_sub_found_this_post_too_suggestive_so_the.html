<li>the shadow cast on the moon is the shadow <strong><em>of</em></strong> the earth. it is crescent. and, that comes from what? i pyramid shape? a turtle shell? it&#39;s pretty damn obvious if you would spend a few minutes processing information rather than rattling off dumb objections.</li>
<li>just curious. since it&#39;s night in hong kong and day in new york, what is your brilliant idea for how a flat planet would accommodate that? giant curtains? and how does the sun set over this giant plate of a world when people in new york are looking at a sunset and in hawaii it&#39;s noon?</li>

    <div class="md"><p>A crescent moon is caused by the moon&#39;s own form shadow, according to globe earth theory. 
Even for the theory of which you are a proponent of, you don&#39;t even have the details straight.</p>

<p>day night cycles on a flat earth could be caused by a relatively low moving sun close to the earth&#39;s surface, which would give rise to perspective convergence as the sun moves away from you. also intensity of the sun light could factor, as light has exponential falloff of intensity the further from the source you are.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>sigh. when they post stuff like this you know they&#39;re not even trying.</p>

<p>From the article:</p>

<p><strong>Shadows and Sticks</strong></p>

<p>If you stick a stick in the ground, it will produce a shadow. The shadow moves as time passes. If the world had been flat, then two sticks in different locations would produce the same shadow.</p>

<p>Imagine the Sun&#39;s rays hitting two sticks, some distance apart. If the Earth were flat, the resulting shadows would be the same length, no matter how far apart you place the sticks.
But they don’t. This is because the earth is round, and not flat.&quot;</p>
