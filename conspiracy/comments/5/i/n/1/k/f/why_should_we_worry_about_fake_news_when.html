        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>It&#39;s not new news that the NDAA (national defense authorization act) of 2012 repealed the Smith-Mundt act which in essence made it legal for the US government to use propaganda techniques against the US population. It&#39;s not new news, but it hasn&#39;t changed, it&#39;s a well documented event that hasn&#39;t had any changes over the last four years. </p>

<p>I used to give human intelligence a lot of credit, but I&#39;m doubting myself now. How hard is it for people to look back and see what their government has described as legal action? I&#39;m guilty of this myself, like why the fuck am I just learning about this now a week ago in 2016? </p>

<p>It just goes to show, &#39;fake news&#39; is hardly the problem. really the problem ought to be considered as an enforced culture of ignorance. But I feel like I&#39;m preaching to the choir here, like how the hell do I respond to my friends and peers and loved ones dismissing pizza hate offhand as &#39;fake news&#39; when they can&#39;t even imagine their government running propoganda against them? </p>

<p>Is it really such an unusual thing to be aware of this kind of stuff? In my heart of hearts I pray that this culture of ignorance exists only or at least merely primarily in the USA, does anyone have any indication that things aren&#39;t so bad in other places around the world??</p>

    <p class="byline text-muted mb-0"><a href="javascript:;" class="score"><span class="badge badge-secondary">15</span></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a class="author" href="../../../../../../../../user/Karl_Magnus_Verum.html">Karl_Magnus_Verum</a> 2016-12-16</p>
    <div class="md"><p>You sort of answered your own question. Let me ellaborate;</p>

<p>News are (supposed to be) reports of what happens.</p>

<p>Journalism is investigative reporting, revealing (as far as humanly possible) the What, How, Who, Where, When, and ultimately Why will be self-evident. If not, the Why can be analysed, and an argumented thesis may be derived and presented, and a dialogue may take place, giving room for discussion, even a debate on the issue.</p>

<p>Propaganda is just the oposite; It present a <em>version</em> of what happens that does not nescessarily reflect what actually took place. And all the talk about the Government attempting to help &quot;ban fake news&quot;, is not only a bad talking point, but can ultimately become extremely dangerous in the future (which it already is). It also happens to coincide that the US Government wants to control what is news or not, right after the election of a new president that so avidly has been open and critic about the media and it&#39;s perspective on reality, because it is pretty self-evident that the media (MSM) does not reflect the opinions of the American people, but support a version of reality few reckognize as truth anymore. So what does Government do? They want to strangle any alternative. This should be a self-evident red flag of major proportions. </p>

<p>The Human Mind thrives on information, and regular rational humanbeings need only facts to arrive at a conclusion. We need the &quot; What, How, Who, Where, When&quot; to arrive at the Why, and thus make a rational explanation for what took place.</p>

<p>When you are living in a place where information is <em>restricted</em>, you are per definition not able to make a complete and coherent decision, because you may lack the factors as to arrive at the proper conclusion based on facts. </p>

<p>This is partly why the internet can be a confusing place to begin with, because we humans are pr. biology depended upon information that derives from all of our senses, and the internet does not give you a human face for example, from which you can analyze the person giving you the information in a natural fashion.</p>

<p>That is why information can be very disinformative, because humans lying on the internet, would rarely do so straight to your face, as it can be very hard to disguise your intentions, and even harder on your reputation if you get caught either red-handed, or later on, in a lie. If you are caught lying amongst fellows, you are usually elligible for expulsion from that social circle in the future, and no-one would easily trust you in future information-exchanges.</p>

<p>The important perspective of this, is that the Government(s), around the World actually, are cooperating to keep the &quot;official narrative&quot; as coherent as possible. The long planned narrative for this is called &quot;Agenda 21&quot;, which you should get thoroughly intimate with if you want to understand the Big Picture. And remember, &quot;Sustainable Development&quot; include HUMANBEINGS (yes <em>you</em>), so think about that when you see calculations regarding &quot;surplus&quot; and &quot;overpopulation&quot;.... </p>

<p>Check out <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B0DbgfmRSAQ">this video by Alan Watt</a> to get an in-depth overview. It&#39;s ~2hrs long, though <em>well</em> worth your time, I promise you. (Disregard Alex Jones in the beginning, it&#39;s the best version out there. It&#39;s the words of the man that counts, not who introduced him).</p>

<p>Go to the Middle East for example, and get their story of what the Western Forces are doing there, and it would not be long before you would understand why the Muslim world is fucking pissed off at the West, because they <em>live</em> the results of a War that you only hear <em>one side of</em>. </p>

<p>To be blunt, the bubble is bursting, and the NATO alliance may soon turn out to become a split unit, because people around the world are &quot;waking up&quot; to the fact that this war is all based on lies, lies and more lies. An interesting observation to the role of NATO, is how the Norwegian Government about a week ago asked Obama what stand to take regarding Russia after Trump was announced pres. elect, which goes to show that per definition, the Norwegian Government has given up their sovereignity to the President of The United States - and this, as a fellow born in this territory, makes me incredibly furious.</p>

<p>I won&#39;t go too far down any rabbit holes here, but suffice it to say that the moment you give Government the right to decide what you will interpret as reality, you can per definition no longer be acknowledged as a self-tought and rational individual, and when the population is divided into two this way, you end up with one part of the population who has given up their own common sense for a Government Narrative, who in turn are turned against the other half of the population who can see with their own two eyes what is happening (and have lived much longer too, to see the development long-term), but are &quot;forbidden to speak out&quot;, because the other half goes along with what Big Daddy has decided, so to speak, and the entire apparatus is thus turned against those who can think for themselves. The young are thus (inadvertently being) used as a tools against the &quot;old&quot;, in turn breaking up basic family values along the way. (This is a receipe of communism, now coined officially as Globalism).</p>

<p>The election you have just witnessed is testimony to this reality, and now the part of the population who effectively have been forced into silence for decades, have finally had a voice through Donald Trump. That is why both the youth are confused, and Mainstream Media desperate to cover the hole in the Titanic, because now their white asses are so visible, it must be quite embarrassing, I can imagine.</p>

<p>So a long story short; Trust you own two eyes, follow your own heart, and you will know truth. Government should be a reflection of this, and if it is not, it is per definition tyrannical, and a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaWSqboZr1w">Despotism</a>. It is time all of y&#39;all face to reckognize this, lest you want Government decide what you have for dinner tomorrow.</p>

<hr/>

<p>EDIT: Added the part about strangling, Norway, Agenda 21 + link, and fixed some spelling.</p>

<p>Also, I want to ellaborate on my own narrative; Do not misunderstand, I am not mad at any of you. We are all being throwed hither and tither for the sake of Globalism. A One World Governement is a great idea, but like many ideas, they may prove to be an utter catastrophe in reality.</p>

<p>The forced vaccinations recently is a testimony to this, in times when it becoming increasingly evident that vaccines may do much harm to the human nervous system. I myself are suffering as a cause of this, but this is not the topic at hand, just be aware that humanity is being played big time atm, and you should be very cautious in you daily affairs. </p>

<p>EDIT 2: </p>

<p>The only way out of the darkness is through knowledge. Don&#39;t stop searching for answers - you will thank yourself later down the line, and you will be able to shine some light upon the darkness for others too. </p>

<p>-Just hang in there.</p>

<p>EDIT 3: Grammar again. And put Alan Watt as a stand-alone column.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>norway&#39;s inquiry is motivated by article 5 of the NATO treaty, which requires all signatories and NATO protectorates to retaliate to any attack on another signatory/protectorate, regardless of which party initiated the conflict.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.nato.int/cps/en/natohq/official_texts_17120.htm">http://www.nato.int/cps/en/natohq/official_texts_17120.htm</a></p>

<p>i.e. the US could fire the first shot, provoking a military response, and article 5 is still triggered, which starts WWIII. a no-fly zone over syria is begging for article 5&#39;s activation, as are US troops on the russian border.</p>

<p>NATO began massing troops along russia&#39;s border from the baltic to the black sea over 2 years ago. </p>

<p>norway, canada, finland, and the US have been conducting war exercises in the artic circle, as has russia, ever since the northwest passage began to be increasingly more navigable in the summers. </p>

<p>all have been getting increasingly more beligerant about whom &quot;owns&quot; the arctic, esp. canada (so much for their sainthood).  people forget that canda wasn&#39;t even a proper country until after 1945, and has never had to have a miltary presence because they could always count on us to defend this continent. but now they are getting greedy....</p>

<p>WWI was the world&#39;s stupidest war ever. it was caused soley by reciprocal treaties of aid in response to agression.</p>

<p>austria attacked serbia triggering russia&#39;s obligation to come to serbia&#39;s aid. </p>

<p>russia declared war on austria in response, triggering germany&#39;s obligation to austria. </p>

<p>austria and germany declared war on russia in response, triggering france&#39;s obligation to russia. </p>

<p>france declared war on germany and austria in response, triggering germany and austria&#39;s obligations to each other.</p>

<p>germany and austria declared war on france, triggering brittain&#39;s obligation to france. </p>

<p>brittain declared war on germany and austria, who reciprocated, and voila, one of the most horrible events in human history, for nothing but a serbian nationalist&#39;s poorly considered bullet.</p>

<p>the US, by saying russia installed trump, is saying in code designed to confuse the public, that russia committed an act of war. </p>

<p>norway knows this. the US has not tried to walk back its rashness, but escalate it. norway also knows it is a direct target due to its own saber rattling with and proximity to russia.</p>

<p>4000 US troops were just deployed to poland.</p>

<p>obama just threatened russia by saying we will retailiate against it for fucking with our election.</p>

<p>putin responded immediately, in no under certain terms, saying put up or shut up and walk back that threat. we double down again in response.</p>

<p>this has nothing to do with vaccines or pizzagate. this has been coming down the pipeline for several years.</p>

<p>you&#39;re right about the fake news narrative--it&#39;s just plain old, straight up orwellian newspeak propaganda: war is peace, freedom is slavery, ingnorance is strength. </p>

<p>and boomers, like my dad, are falling for it hook, line, and sinker. he even accused me--magna cum laude in philosohpy, 4.00 grad information theory MS, jd from top ten law school, and a research atty in a &quot;big law&quot; law firm, of not knowing anything but fake news bullshit.</p>

<p>i don&#39;t think any of this it is about pizzagate, i think pizzagate is just a coincidence. i think it is about silencing RT and counter-govt information sources. </p>

<p>briebart and infowars weren&#39;t the only fake news targets, so were the most respected leftist counter-govt online publications, who all immediately threatened to sue and who were dropped from the list immediately because they have pultizer prize winning contributors and former NYT editors on their staffs.</p>

<p>i think the hysteria right now is because trump has repeatedly said he&#39;s got no beef with russia and the clock is ticking for the puppet master&#39;s puppets. john mccain has said he will stop the exxon CEO state dept pick, who also is friendly with russia, just because he is friendly with russia. </p>

<p>think about that. exxon owns the GOP, and the GOP are saying one of their biggest donors is unacceptable...because of russia.</p>

<p>i think everything is on overdrive right now to make it impossible to derail a hot war with russia. </p>

<p>exposing pizzagate is admirable,  but most pizzagaters, most on this forum, most on reddit, FB, twitter, youtube, etc are the ones who&#39;ll get the call to duty, because our little, stretched too thin all volunteer army can&#39;t handle a hot war with russia and china and north korea (china and north korea have recirprocal aid treaties with russia)...and it looks like japan is getting antsy because it&#39;s opened talks with russia.</p>

<p>they are targetting the means for your generation to effectively counter not only a war, but the draft...to not only disallow discussion, but the spread of counter-propaganda &quot;fake news&quot; information about it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Note that these articles <em>of faith</em> are set forth in an order determined by certain other pre-stated and pre-existent legal precedents and priorities whose conditions must be duly recognised and legitimately upheld in order to invoke any said Articles or for any actions to be undertaken as described in them, all of which are also supposed to be subject to the dictates of International Law. </p>

<p>Arcticle 1 which is the first principle stated, is subject to the first principles and priorities of the UN. So it should only be invoked if it is consistent and fully compliant with those UN principles and priorities as given in the preamble to the Alliance&#39;s own charter.</p>

<p>Within Article 1 it also clearly states that all NATO members agree to settle any international disputes in which they may be involved &quot;by peaceful means in such a manner that international peace and security and justice are not endangered, and to refrain in their international relations from the threat or use of force in any manner inconsistent with the purposes of the United Nations.&quot;</p>

<p>That doesn&#39;t mean that the Alliance can&#39;t or won&#39;t unilaterally bend or break the law against making war in what it alone considers to be an emergency or some immediate threat to one of it&#39;s members but it leaves any within that alliance itself a legitimate way for any of them to refuse to co-operate or not involve themselves in it if by their own interpretation of that, or that of the UN charter, indicates that the reasons being given for either those actions or their most likely outcome are inconsistent with the Alliance&#39;s own legal and moral obligations as they understood them to be upon agreeing to sign and become a member of it, or to abstain under protest if they feel the same way about even the UN&#39;s own reasons vs. it&#39;s legal and moral obligations even if it does agrees with what NATO wants or decides to do. </p>

<p>Moreover their right to do that cannot be challenged. It is the right of every sovereign nation state as well as the right of that nation&#39;s people to determine that for and among themselves and to have that decision respected especially if that is a decision to remain neutral until such time as there is no other course or recourse but to resort to as much force as that nation and it&#39;s people deem are necessary. </p>

<p>In the simplest of terms, we can&#39;t protect our own sovereignty or that of any other nation state by surrendering or having it marginalized or compromised by the will of any foreign power or foreign agency, irrespective of whether it claims to be friendly one or not. Period. </p>

<p>Any government that permits that has not only ceased to speak for a &quot;sovereign nation&quot; but ceased to speak for that nation&#39;s people who only agree to abide by any laws that government enacts because they actually come from a genuine sovereign authority that strictly represents them and their best interests not some watered-down and compromised excuse for one that is more beholden to some foreign power or other foreign agencies and their dictates than it is to them.</p>

<p>There is no more egregious or reprehensible claim than that any nation&#39;s sovereignty needs to take second place to nothing more than the mere convenience and increased profitability of international and multi-national banking, business, and investment interests that are solely interested in that and nothing more in how they deal with any country or it&#39;s people for whom that sovereignty is the only thing that stands between having themselves and all the rest of their nation&#39;s resources exploited for less than what it is worth to them or placed in position where they have no other choice but to submit to it which entails an involuntary surrender of their right to self-determination. Their sovereignty and that of their nation is a one and the same thing, any compromise to one equally compromises the other.</p>

<p>That actually is the battle we are all facing and in turn must fight. It&#39;s not just or sovereignty that&#39;s at stake but our ability to maintain our national identity and character and to choose what changes to it that are clearly in our own best interests as well.</p>

<p>The fight to preserve our planet on which all of our lives depends begins with an understanding of the absolute necessity of all of the natural diversity that exists upon it and maintaining and promoting as much of it wherever we happen to be on it as we conceivably can. We ourselves are social creatures and despite whatever trappings and adornments or lack thereof any of our various societies and cultures have there is an organic quality to them that directly relates to the land we live on and happen to call home. That&#39;s the bottom line and the end of the game if we lose it.  </p>

<p>KINDOF...  Propaganda has always been used against the american people.  Now we&#39;re talking about propaganda specifically meant to target foreign audiences- by the BBG and State Department.</p>

<p>When the Church Committee investigated the CIA and highlighted that project mockingbird was putting CIA agents in positions of journalism- they technically outlawed it.  But what does that really mean?  When you&#39;re running cointel for the CIA, you don&#39;t have to be on CIA payroll.  Agents on payroll get a &quot;cover&quot; job.  There are actual agents working in every industry and every large company.  At a certain point, it&#39;s no longer necessary to keep you on payroll- you&#39;ll keep doing your job.  Anderson Cooper &quot;interned&quot; at the CIA in college before becoming a journalist.  He has probably never been on CIA payroll beyond that.  So TECHNICALLY, he doesn&#39;t work for the CIA.  But the reality is that he probably DOES, in a sense.  Just not in a sense that is illegal according to the letter of the law.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>how the hell do I respond to my friends and peers and loved ones dismissing pizza hate offhand as &#39;fake news&#39; when they can&#39;t even imagine their government running propoganda against them? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>it&#39;s kindof isolating.  I personally dismiss &quot;pizzagate&quot; after having looked at the &quot;evidence&quot;- but I agree with you on the communication issues.</p>

<p>At the holidays, I know it&#39;s going to be a lot of people talking about Russian Hacks and fake news and so on- and I know I need to keep my mouth shut, because somehow I look like the CRAZY one for not accepting, sans any evidence, that it was PUTIN who leaked the DNC emails to julian assange.  Now I&#39;m a Russian apologist because I think the mess in the middle east- Syria, Libya, Iraq, ISIS, etc- is absolutely 100% our fault.  I haven&#39;t seen a valid argument against it, but I&#39;m a negative nancy for having questioned the WMDs in Iqaq story from the get go. When I said that there was no way a movie prompted the attack on the benghazi consulate, I was the idiot.  It&#39;s upsetting to watch, because it&#39;s used to justify all sorts of terrible things.</p>

<p>Maybe if it was an honest discussion- someone said to me &quot;Here is why we need to stop Asiatic Russia/ Eurasia from forming an alliance with France/ Germany...  These are the reasons we need to fuel Sunni/ Saudi extremism to keep Iran/ Syria in check...  This is why its important to support Israel as a jewish state in an Arab region...&quot;  If you could have a logic fueled conversation with me and explain to me the ideological necessity that drives this, I would be more than open to listening to you.  But it&#39;s just lies and propaganda to support certain groups and justify murdering hundreds of thousands of people while destroying entire cultures and driving them towards extremism.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>Is it really such an unusual thing to be aware of this kind of stuff?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes. I didn&#39;t begin seeing the bigger picture until watching <a href="http://thoughtmaybe.com/the-century-of-the-self/">&quot;The Century of the Self”</a> and began to suspect things I heard from the mainstream media. From that I started looking more into the documentary&#39;s focal point, Edward Bernays, who is considered one of the pioneers of modern advertising, public relations, and propaganda and in Time/Life&#39;s list of the 100 most influential people of the 20th Century - that most people have never heard of until recently. </p>

<p>I download one of his works <a href="http://www.whale.to/b/bernays.pdf">&quot;Propaganda&quot;</a>, written in 1928. It gets right to the point and this shocking very first paragraph is what greets you;</p>

<p><em>“The conscious and intelligent manipulation of the organized habits and opinions of the masses is an important element in democratic society. Those who manipulate this unseen mechanism of society constitute an invisible government which is the true ruling power of our country.”</em></p>

<p>Bernays and Walter Lippman&#39;s <a href="http://monoskop.org/images/b/bf/Lippman_Walter_Public_Opinion.pdf">&quot;Public Opinion&quot;</a> (1922) helped the government form a policy of how to deal with the public. Bernays, working as a consultant, was instrumental in softening public opinion against the US entering WWI.  </p>

<p>It&#39;s a no-brainer to believe the public is more pliable believing they&#39;re not being manipulated. </p>

<p>Here&#39;s a quote from Bernays&#39; 1947 work <a href="http://classes.dma.ucla.edu/Fall07/28/Engineering_of_consent.pdf">&quot;The Engineering of Consent&quot;</a> which after the 2016 election cycle should seem all too familiar;</p>

<p><em>&quot;Freedom of speech and its democratic corollary, a free press, have tacitly expanded our Bill of Rights to include the right of persuasion. This development was an inevitable result of the expansion of the media of free speech and persuasion, defined in other articles in this volume. All these media provide open doors to the public mind. Any one of us through these media may influence the attitudes and actions of our fellow citizens.&quot;</em></p>

<p>These techniques are known worldwide as a normal part of statecraft. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>What&#39;s this about an anti Russian propaganda department?</p>

<p>But the thing about &quot;propaganda in the US&quot; is completely disingenuous. They still can&#39;t create material for US audiences, they&#39;re just allowed to disseminate the material made for foreign audiences in the US.</p>

<p>It was an out of date restriction because of both the internet and the fact that any news service could, and did show it to US audiences anyway.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Note that these articles <em>of faith</em> are set forth in an order determined by certain other pre-stated and pre-existent legal precedents and priorities whose conditions must be duly recognised and legitimately upheld in order to invoke any said Articles or for any actions to be undertaken as described in them, all of which are also supposed to be subject to the dictates of International Law. </p>

<p>Arcticle 1 which is the first principle stated, is subject to the first principles and priorities of the UN. So it should only be invoked if it is consistent and fully compliant with those UN principles and priorities as given in the preamble to the Alliance&#39;s own charter.</p>

<p>Within Article 1 it also clearly states that all NATO members agree to settle any international disputes in which they may be involved &quot;by peaceful means in such a manner that international peace and security and justice are not endangered, and to refrain in their international relations from the threat or use of force in any manner inconsistent with the purposes of the United Nations.&quot;</p>

<p>That doesn&#39;t mean that the Alliance can&#39;t or won&#39;t unilaterally bend or break the law against making war in what it alone considers to be an emergency or some immediate threat to one of it&#39;s members but it leaves any within that alliance itself a legitimate way for any of them to refuse to co-operate or not involve themselves in it if by their own interpretation of that, or that of the UN charter, indicates that the reasons being given for either those actions or their most likely outcome are inconsistent with the Alliance&#39;s own legal and moral obligations as they understood them to be upon agreeing to sign and become a member of it, or to abstain under protest if they feel the same way about even the UN&#39;s own reasons vs. it&#39;s legal and moral obligations even if it does agrees with what NATO wants or decides to do. </p>

<p>Moreover their right to do that cannot be challenged. It is the right of every sovereign nation state as well as the right of that nation&#39;s people to determine that for and among themselves and to have that decision respected especially if that is a decision to remain neutral until such time as there is no other course or recourse but to resort to as much force as that nation and it&#39;s people deem are necessary. </p>

<p>In the simplest of terms, we can&#39;t protect our own sovereignty or that of any other nation state by surrendering or having it marginalized or compromised by the will of any foreign power or foreign agency, irrespective of whether it claims to be friendly one or not. Period. </p>

<p>Any government that permits that has not only ceased to speak for a &quot;sovereign nation&quot; but ceased to speak for that nation&#39;s people who only agree to abide by any laws that government enacts because they actually come from a genuine sovereign authority that strictly represents them and their best interests not some watered-down and compromised excuse for one that is more beholden to some foreign power or other foreign agencies and their dictates than it is to them.</p>

<p>There is no more egregious or reprehensible claim than that any nation&#39;s sovereignty needs to take second place to nothing more than the mere convenience and increased profitability of international and multi-national banking, business, and investment interests that are solely interested in that and nothing more in how they deal with any country or it&#39;s people for whom that sovereignty is the only thing that stands between having themselves and all the rest of their nation&#39;s resources exploited for less than what it is worth to them or placed in position where they have no other choice but to submit to it which entails an involuntary surrender of their right to self-determination. Their sovereignty and that of their nation is a one and the same thing, any compromise to one equally compromises the other.</p>

<p>That actually is the battle we are all facing and in turn must fight. It&#39;s not just or sovereignty that&#39;s at stake but our ability to maintain our national identity and character and to choose what changes to it that are clearly in our own best interests as well.</p>

<p>The fight to preserve our planet on which all of our lives depends begins with an understanding of the absolute necessity of all of the natural diversity that exists upon it and maintaining and promoting as much of it wherever we happen to be on it as we conceivably can. We ourselves are social creatures and despite whatever trappings and adornments or lack thereof any of our various societies and cultures have there is an organic quality to them that directly relates to the land we live on and happen to call home. That&#39;s the bottom line and the end of the game if we lose it.  </p>
