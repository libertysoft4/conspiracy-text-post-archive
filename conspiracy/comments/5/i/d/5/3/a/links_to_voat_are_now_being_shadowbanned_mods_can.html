        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Earlier, I was responding <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/5icmku/what_exactly_is_the_evidence_for_pizzagate/">to a post about pizzagate</a>. A guy asked for evidence, and I provided a link to a compilation of information over at Voat. Little did I know, but my posts with links to Voat were being shadowbanned automatically. I also attacked <a href="/u/Yum_Kaax">/u/Yum_Kaax</a> for ignoring my link, so thank you Reddit for making me look like an ass.</p>

<p>Mods, can you explain the source of this censorship? Is it specific to this sub or did Reddit admins implement it site-wide?</p>

<p>Edit: We have an answer thanks to Sabremesh.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I can confirm that if you post a link to /v/pizzagate in a comment anywhere on reddit, it will not be visible - it is automatically redirected to the modqueue of the relevant subreddit. This is a decision by the admins, nothing to do with the mods of <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>.</p>

<p>However, the mods here can see these comments as they appear in the modqueue, and if the voat link is not a doxx, it can be manually approved, at which point it will appear in the thread it was posted to.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Edit 2: I just discovered that Reddit is also blocking these links in private messages, which seems to prove that Reddit isn&#39;t simply trying to protect themselves against any legal liability. They want to do everything they can to hide this information from the public.</p>

<p>Amazing that they&#39;re actually looking at content on other sites to see if links can be posted here. And only with pizzagate stuff. I think a lot of the more lurid pizza stuff is nonsense, but media and govt reaction says there&#39;s something huge in there somewhere..</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No. The point is precisely that Reddit is censoring pizzagate talk. They banned every sub linked to it. Most of them had not been involved in any doxxing. Even then, it&#39;s not normal practice to ban a sub for the actions of individual members. </p>

<p>But for them to be banning links to another website where doxxing may or may not be happening is a step beyond that again. I&#39;ve never heard of anything like it, except where links are blatantly illegal.</p>

<p>Effectively, Reddit moderators are now moderating voat. And the fact that it&#39;s only the pizzagate section on voat that gets this treatment further confirms that there&#39;s a concerted effort to suppress any and all pizzagate related content... </p>

<p>However evidence often contains names etc.</p>

<p>That is what evidence is. For example an email or something.</p>

<p>So if people want to show that there is evidence they have to show names such as the email on wikileaks but if they show the names then moderators are not allowed to link to it so then everyone runs around saying there is no evidence? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Reddit (admins and it&#39;s users) have long taken a stance on not doxxing people, even linking to publicly available information. I&#39;ve been here 8 years, this is how things have always been. Do you remember when <a href="/u/violentacrez">/u/violentacrez</a> was doxxed by Adrian Chen of Gawker, and basically all the moderators of the website (not the admins) banned gawker and related sites from being submitted?</p>

<p>Personal views aside, the admins, and users, don&#39;t like doxxing.</p>

<p>I think the admins especially cared when reddi concluded that someone who wasn&#39;t a Boston bomber, was. Which got media airplay that was bad. Bad PR for the site.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You are banned from a sub by the subs mods. You are shadowbanned from the site by the admins. Looks like links to the voat subreddit automatically shadowban (autospammed), admins just put a filter on. Using a workaround would probably not result in a full shadow or permaban, because they never explicitly stated why the links are shadowbanned in the first place </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I should point out, that we will only find out if someone does get banned, creates an alt, and discloses that they were banned.</p>

<p>But when your account is permabanned, you lose access and can&#39;t even see your recent posts, so it would be very difficult to say someone was banned specifically for using a work around. Shadowbanning is a different story, their posts would still be visible.</p>

<p>We don&#39;t normally hear anything about the admins doing something like that, but there will be little evidence to prove or disprove that it happens.</p>

<p>Guess I&#39;m trying to say I doubt they will, but if they did, it would be very difficult for us to find out.</p>

<p>But the fact they still allow PG discussions (minus doxxing and harassing) shows me they don&#39;t care about controlling PG talks. I really think it&#39;s all about the doxxing and harassing and them covering their own asses and not wanting reddit to be associated with that aspect of PG </p>

<p>Can you promise that all of the mods will actually double check <em>every</em> voat link prior to approval? Seems to me a lot of stuff gets through that shouldn&#39;t.</p>

<p>(You should sticky your comment to the top)</p>

<p>Edit: Crickets. Then I guess we can expect voat links to be approved <em>without</em> mods checking to make sure they don&#39;t contain personal info or incite harassment/violence.( <a href="http://www.reddit.com/rules">http://www.reddit.com/rules</a> ). Now that we understand that we&#39;ll know the reason when this sub gets banned and who is responsible. Henceforth I <em>will</em> be reporting such content here to the admins. Previously I&#39;ve  just reported it to the mods here but they still regularly approve such posts. If you guys don&#39;t want to follow Reddit&#39;s rules then you&#39;ll deserve a ban.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thats kind of bad logic.  First of all, pizzagate is a conspiracy theory - if there is a new major development in the investigation, it is absolutely relevant in this sub.  Secondly, you are worried about the risk of pizzagate getting this sub banned.. thats censorship!  There isnt really anything inherently wrong with the investigation of pizzagate that it should have ever been censored, or mentions of it being censored.  You are basically saying blaming the topic for the censorship, rather than blaming the reddit admin who are censoring the speech. Makes no sense</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Wrong, it&#39;s angle was normal before it was moved to a specific position before the shooting. Someone literally caught them moving it hours before the shooting.

    <div class="md"><p>And the camera still didn&#39;t point at CPP before it was moved the first time. I am willing to believe you, but I saw those threads and not a single one had the view of the camera before it was moved. For other people who have no idea, the camera is a dome type camera that can be moved/rotated remotely.</p>

<p>There&#39;s nothing proving it was ever monitoring CPP. Just speculation. It is a traffic camera and the last I saw it was pointed at the intersection after it was moved again.</p>

<p>Amazing that they&#39;re actually looking at content on other sites to see if links can be posted here. And only with pizzagate stuff. I think a lot of the more lurid pizza stuff is nonsense, but media and govt reaction says there&#39;s something huge in there somewhere..</p>
