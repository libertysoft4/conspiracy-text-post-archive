<blockquote>
<p>At reddit we care deeply about <strong>not imposing ours or anyone elses&#39; opinions</strong> on how people use the reddit platform. We are adamant about <strong>not limiting the ability to use the reddit platform even when we do not ourselves agree with or condone a specific use.</strong> We have very few rules here on reddit; no spamming, no cheating, no personal info, nothing illegal, and no interfering the site&#39;s functions. Today we are adding another rule: No suggestive or sexual content featuring minors.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>In my country several pedophiles have come forward in the media that they were born with this disposition but never want to hurt anyone nor posses media for which children were hurt. Together with a doctor some of them decided to have themselves treated by hormone therapy, removing their sex drive entirely. As a result, they are not harmful, and they can engage in a dialogue with broader society how to treat their affliction.</p>

<p>Imho, this is the best possible outcome. And we still need to engage more of these people in the dialogue, to root out child sexual abuse entirely. Stigmatization of those who try to make things better even if it means outing themselves isn&#39;t going to solve anything.</p>

<p>I am sorry that you read that into my comment because I did not!</p>

<p>Im not saying that society will one day learn to tolerate people who are pedophiles, but rather that they will realise one day that it&#39;s far more helpful to try and deal with the problem by methods like chemical castration or something rather than just waiting and hoping that they commit a crime so that they can be identified and thrown in jail. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I came here to post something exactly like this. </p>

<p>It&#39;s easy to have a knee jerk reaction to someone committing an absolutely horrific crime. I can understand the desire to just brand them for life and to kick the shit out of them/castrate them. </p>

<p>But just like the war on drugs, brute force won&#39;t mitigate the harms or continuance of this problem. Unfortunately this is a historically recurring urge some humans exhibit. It&#39;s not going to stop for a very long time. </p>

<p>What I&#39;m getting at is that we need to allow places like that sub to exist because it allows dialogue. I&#39;m not a fan of them sharing CP or arranging offline illegal activities, but if their discussions entail with emotional support and resources, I&#39;m okay with that. I can&#39;t tell because there is no way in hell I want to end up on a list somewhere by clicking into that sub. </p>

<p>I feel (but don&#39;t have data to back it up) that most people with these urges know how wrong it is. They know what happens if they get caught. They don&#39;t want their lives ruined. </p>

<p>spaces for them to privately handle their urges without harming or endangering children are necessary. as disgusting as I find their sexual urges I would rather have a million non violent private creepers than 500 active ones comitting illegal sex crimes in the real world. </p>

<p>Harm reduction works with drugs. There&#39;s a solid chance it can work with other parts of humanity&#39;s vices.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>In theory it sounds reasonable,  and I&#39;d agree.  In theory. </p>

<p>I absolutely agree with harm reduction. I agree that giving help to pedophiles mitigates more damage than simply ostracizing them.  I do believe that pedophiles probably are not even at fault for their own desires- actions certainly, but desires not so much.</p>

<p>In practice, in context, and in specifics... I&#39;m not sure that giving pedophiles a platform to speak with other pedophiles in an anonymous and uncontrolled format is harm reduction. </p>

<p>Pedo&#39;s anonymous? I&#39;m sorry,  but I think a group of pedophiles is capable of far more harm and damage than the same number of pedophiles working alone. Sum greater than whole of its parts,  and all. I&#39;m not sure that the people I&#39;d want giving pedophiles support are other pedophiles. In fact,  I&#39;d believe the last people they should be around are people with the same urges. </p>

<p>Prison inmates don&#39;t have access to outside information.  Most of them don&#39;t even know the time.</p>

<p>EDIT:  In order for another inmate in the jail to find out what you actually did, they would have to enlist an outside party to research your name.  They would have absolutely no reason to do this unless they thought you were lying, and they would have very little reason to suspect you of lying since they would have no outside information to cross-reference in the first place.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;d suggest you go talk to some CO&#39;s from state level penitentiaries. Information from the outside travels readily from watching news stations, talking to people on the phones, and from new inmates. People also have cell phones smuggled in on the regular.</p>

<p>Yes, it&#39;s customary. In low security prisons people talk to each other all the time. People who are doing small stints don&#39;t talk to other inmates but when they are looking at more than a year there&#39;s plenty of socializing going on. Maybe your friends were in county or local prison which typically involves inmates keeping to themselves. </p>

<p>Sometimes the correction officers will actually let it slip to an inmate on purpose. And jail/prison is worse than high school when it comes to things like gossip, or any other useful information they could use against someone later. The information spreads like wildfire in there.</p>

<p>If the information doesn&#39;t come from a CO and you want information about someone inside with you, all you need to do is ask someone during a phone call to look the person up. If they&#39;re a sex offender, they&#39;re very easy to find (at least in my state.)</p>

They aren&#39;t psychiatricaly qualified to help each other, that&#39;s what a licensed therapist aught to be doing. A pedo meeting another pedo (off the internet) to discuss pedophillia is just going to end up in both of them rationalizing pedophillia as being OK.</p>

<p>It&#39;s just common sense 101: pedophiles meeting each other online isn&#39;t for self improvement, it&#39;s for pedophillia.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well if you actually read the Admins statement explaining why those subs were banned you&#39;d understand why that wasn&#39;t an option.</p>

<p>r/Jailbait was a very active subreddit with a very large amount of pictures being uploaded daily. The amount of moderation that was required e.g removing and reporting CP to the feds was just to much to handle so it got shut down. The actual Jailbait itself wasn&#39;t illegal but the line between JB an CP is thin so an additional rule was required.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Isn&#39;t this likely more of a legal thing? They&#39;re not likely to get in trouble for hosting &quot;questionable content&quot; unless they do so knowingly in a provable fashion. They can pretty much ignore the small pedo subs because they&#39;re miniscule, they tread the line (but never actively cross it) because there&#39;s no threat to the company as a whole.</p>

<p>On the other hand, pizzagate was enormous and in the media. It was a very big sub and, at the very least the admins claimed, there was the rampant posting (and poor control) of personally identifying information. If someone were to act on that information, it would open them up to one <em>hell</em> of a lawsuit. They couldn&#39;t claim ignorance in that case. It was &quot;ban or get sued&quot;.</p>

<p>Mind there may or may not be an actual conspiracy here but the business answer is the most direct and complete one. Nobody is going to sue them or threaten them for <a href="/r/pedo101">/r/pedo101</a>. Pizzagate was aiming to identify government employees; the types who have the resources to shove a lawsuit so far up Reddit&#39;s ass that spez himself would be eating shit as a result. The threat of a lawsuit was very real and, conspiracy or not, it&#39;s not surprising that a ban happened.</p>

<p><strong>To articulate it simply</strong>: Reddit&#39;s administrators acted rationally. If there was a conspiracy, it may very well have been orchestrated externally in order to put legal pressure on the website. Whether the legal pressure originated from legitimate or manufactured scenarios Reddit would still be liable.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>But over time, Digg changed. Redesign after redesign unnerved loyal users. Finally, one new version, v4, was so atrocious that there was a mass exodus from the site altogether. The new site was a disaster both visually and content-wise, <strong>as “sponsored links” were thrust onto the front page and users felt like they were being packaged and sold to companies.</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Digg pushed a narrative the users did not agree with and they migrated to Reddit as the new aggregate news/lolcats site.</p>

<p>Reddit today is pushing their own narrative and sites like Voat are in place to repeat those same events.</p>

<p>&quot;If you are in a muslim country you can have fun with a young girl based on muslim law, after she has had her first period, in fact Muhammad married female girls as well, look at child brides, you can express yourself freely in such an area. Just don&#39;t break any laws and stay safe my pedo friend.&quot; Sick, disgusting bastards</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Those pedophile subs were banned because the work that was needed to moderate those subs became to much, distinguishing between what posts were Jailbait and those that could be considered child pornography became much harder when those subs gained popularity.  I believe the Admins said so in the statement you&#39;re referring to. (There was of course the issue with investors not being happy with Reddit being thought of as Jailbait site).</p>

<p>r/pizzagate got shut down because of the &quot;no personal info&quot; rule, moderators couldn&#39;t keep up with the doc dropping so it got shut down. Simple really, but I think you&#39;re right when you say that Aaron wouldn&#39;t be proud of what Reddit has become.</p>

<p>and pedo101 is banned.</p>

<p>In a world where being labled a pedophile is pretty much social and career suicide, places like these need to exist.</p>

Gimme a fucking break! Stop parroting the bullshit cover stories and either actually read into it, or shut up about it. If this is real this is going to come out sooner or later, with our without your input. If it&#39;s not, then nothing will come of it but maybe the mild humiliation of those digging, but moreso the relief that just maybe the elites aren&#39;t raping and murdering kids.

    <div class="md"><p>Or maybe it was banned because it&#39;s a manufactured, coordinated conspiracy. Obviously people with money are trying to control the more impressionable among our population. Liberals call anyone they don&#39;t like &quot;rapists,&quot; and conservatives call all of their enemies &quot;pedophiles.&quot; It&#39;s weaponized propaganda that&#39;s going to destroy this country, and very fast. I imagine the runners at reddit must be able to analye their traffic to know that pizzagate is being directed from some collection of entities. Maybe they banned it to do damage control on psych ops propaganda. It&#39;s crossed my mind at least.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>In theory it sounds reasonable,  and I&#39;d agree.  In theory. </p>

<p>I absolutely agree with harm reduction. I agree that giving help to pedophiles mitigates more damage than simply ostracizing them.  I do believe that pedophiles probably are not even at fault for their own desires- actions certainly, but desires not so much.</p>

<p>In practice, in context, and in specifics... I&#39;m not sure that giving pedophiles a platform to speak with other pedophiles in an anonymous and uncontrolled format is harm reduction. </p>

<p>Pedo&#39;s anonymous? I&#39;m sorry,  but I think a group of pedophiles is capable of far more harm and damage than the same number of pedophiles working alone. Sum greater than whole of its parts,  and all. I&#39;m not sure that the people I&#39;d want giving pedophiles support are other pedophiles. In fact,  I&#39;d believe the last people they should be around are people with the same urges. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>A friend of mine was in jail for a few months last year. We&#39;d talk on the phone a few times a week and this was actually brought up in the conversation. </p>

<p>Sometimes the correction officers will actually let it slip to an inmate on purpose. And jail/prison is worse than high school when it comes to things like gossip, or any other useful information they could use against someone later. The information spreads like wildfire in there.</p>

<p>If the information doesn&#39;t come from a CO and you want information about someone inside with you, all you need to do is ask someone during a phone call to look the person up. If they&#39;re a sex offender, they&#39;re very easy to find (at least in my state.)</p>
