        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>As far as conspiracies go, to me it seems far more likely that the Russians would want to interfere with the election. They have a lot to gain from Trump being President - and therefore a lot to lose if he isn&#39;t i.e. a loss of a potential gain is a loss even before considering the actual losses that would come with an HRC Presidency for Russia. </p>

<p>It also seems like people who believe in Pizzagate are the least likely to believe in Russian election interference. </p>

<p>Can anybody explain this? It seems like a conspiracy itself. 1) there is a continued attempt to focus Trump supporters on things like pizzagate, which at this point, even if true, would be scandals of those who lost and aren&#39;t in power 2) if Trump supporters/standard conservatives/Republicans/alt right are having their primary media sources aimed at pizzagate and still focusing on HRC-related scandals, their attention is being driven away from foreign interference in the Presidential election. 3) if fake news sites are still promoting 3) some of the deep connections between the Trump team and Russia, including with Breitbart, a top cited news source, would leave open the possibility that even these US-based news sources are compromised. </p>

<p>Considering the amount of pizzagate-related stories upvoted to the top of this sub and the lack of Russian election interference posts, I can only be led to believe that the propaganda has been successful at even driving the interest of people interested in conspiracy theory away from considering this issue. To me, this is frightening, because there seems to be an incredible amount of evidence piling up about the Russian conspiracy to undermine US elections yet the Russian influenced media has convinced people to pay attention to less relevant or irrelevant issues.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>but the other side of the coin is that the people who are pushing pizzagate are the most dishonest sources who published heaps of unverified pieces or outright lies throughout the campaign. and these are the sources who are also denying any remote involvement in Russia, who has a clear national interest to be involved.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Seriously, I haven&#39;t really looked at &quot;sources&quot; and the evidence is admittedly circumstantial. This is tactics straight out of the ctr handbook that was passed around.</p>

<p>Make controversial statement. Try to create a straw man argument from unsubstantiated evidence. Try to flame up the audience! </p>

<p>The CIA would not comment on this topic of hacking. Not to claim nor to disprove. Not their job. As a matter of fact the claim is exactly what their role is in other countries. This push by the legacy media is hypocrisy.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Geopolitically, the U.S. has a very tense relationship with Russia. Our involvement with the Ukraine as well as in Syria have been about trying to protect our oil interests, and accordingly, the value of the dollar. The U.S. has a vested interest in conflict with Russia. </p>

<p>That this evidence is coming almost exclusively from the CIA is the biggest warning sign. The FBI and the highest echelon of national intelligence, the ODNI, are not corroborating this story. Further we know that the CIA has a history of utilizing public media for deception. Operation Mockingbird took place from the 50s through the 70s, but there&#39;s no real reason to think that it stopped. That Jeff Bezos, the owner of Washington Post, received a $600 million contract from the CIA should be ample evidence enough. Additionally, this latest bout of Russian fear-mongering started last Friday with an article from, you guessed it, the Washington Post.</p>

<p>Finally, the only government agency with the forensic capability to ascertain without doubt the source of any hacking is the NSA because of XKeyscore. They have been silent on this issue. That anyone is taking seriously the proclamations of anonymous sources in the CIA based on secret evidence, to me, is the greatest mystery here.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>i mean, this sounds more like anti-conspiracy theory to me.</p>

<p>and you&#39;re not addressing one of the main questions i asked: why believe pizzagate, which has far less reliable data about it and which is far less relevant as a subject, while not believing something as important as Russian campaign interference? </p>

<p>it&#39;s interesting you mention the ODNI: would the ODNI stating Russians <em>did</em> interfere change your opinion?</p>

<p>while you discuss the history of the CIA using public opinion for deception the FBI, the other agency you mention, also has a long history of the same behavior. </p>

<p>while the CIA can&#39;t necessarily divulge a lot of intel to the public without compromising sources of both the US and allies, do you at least agree that the Electoral College should be briefed on the intel?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re right, and I absolutely agree that the Electoral College should be briefed on the intel. I just find it very interesting that the intelligence community doesn&#39;t seem to be in agreement at all, but the entirety of the media establishment has picked up the story and is running with it. In actuality, they&#39;re simply publishing uncorroborated assertions that are having a discernible impact on public opinion.</p>

<p>In terms of why more people would believe pizzagate: because this type of behavior is, without a doubt, happening in the world. There are countless cases of pedophilia and abuse in the highest levels of government and business throughout the world, and this seems to fit into that larger picture. I think the focus on Comet and the Clintons is myopic and erroneous, but it&#39;s certainly something which deserves attention to some extent. </p>

<p>It&#39;s certainly easier, for me at least, to understand why people feel strongly about the possibility of children being abused on a massive scale than it is to swallow the, thus far, baseless assertions of an organization that has a sordid history of providing questionable intelligence that leads to war, particularly when it seems that the establishment wants a confrontation with Russia. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>well, your approach in this response is very level headed. i wish more people agreed the EC needs to be briefed with all available intelligence. </p>

<p>the media is in a bit of a pickle. they can&#39;t really publish names of CIA officers or foreign intelligence officials without compromising them, but i hope the full investigation does see the light of day. we can&#39;t have a tainted election result.</p>

<p>i think this type of pizzagate-esque behavior i.e. pedophilia happens throughout the world; Epstein was proof that it happens among the elite. however, i haven&#39;t seen anything that has convinced me of the Comet/Clinton/child sex connection despite a lot of people working hard to make the link, so that&#39;s why i think it&#39;s a distraction from other more serious issues.</p>

<p>with the direction of US/Russia relations for the past 16 years and the trajectory of the Russian economy, i think it&#39;s clear that Russia has at the very least the motivation to be influence the US elections. and even before considering direct election hacks and before considering hacks/release of one political party&#39;s information and not the other, before considering that Russia has the hacking capabilities, at the very least, Russia&#39;s support of fake new proliferation as part of a propaganda campaign has quite a bit of evidence: <a href="http://warontherocks.com/2016/11/trolling-for-trump-how-russia-is-trying-to-destroy-our-democracy/">http://warontherocks.com/2016/11/trolling-for-trump-how-russia-is-trying-to-destroy-our-democracy/</a> starting from that standpoint, it makes sense that they would at least try to take it further, and i think they have.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree the motive is there for Russia, especially given how harsh Clinton&#39;s rhetoric was during the election. As far as the CIA sources are concerned, The Intercept is using their secure drop to encourage whistleblowers within the intelligence community to provide the evidence anonymously that proves Russian involvement. Surely if evidence did exist, it could be done in such a way to protect the sources.</p>

<p>I&#39;d also like to note that this entire dialog about Russia is taking place in the midst of this &quot;fake news&quot; blitz. It&#39;s already being used as a boost to push censorship which is another reason a lot of people are being skeptical. </p>

<p>It&#39;s the most relevant subject because pedophilia is covered up and used worldwide to get blackmail material to be used to control politicians and others. It&#39;s offered as a clandestine &#39;perk &#39; and  details are kept for leverage. If you aren&#39;t  first compromised then you don&#39;t get to run for office. Here is a list of politicians who were suddenly charged with sex crimes and taken down.</p>

<p>Pizza Gate is just one part of the story of worldwide sex crimes against children and you are only listening to people with something to hide who are desperate to deflect blame and belittle the subject. Read  ALL of  this and then get back to us.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The entire 650 000 insider emails that were leaked by Wikileaks,  exposing  clear crimes that  have never been refuted are somehow irrelevant because &quot;Russia did it&quot;.</p>

<p>If I knew your psychology as they clearly do
 I could manage to say that too to get my neck out of a noose.</p>

<p>There is absolutely no proof or even an allegation   that Russia WROTE those emails there&#39;s just the false unsupported claim that they hacked them. </p>

<p>They are uncontested  criminal   evidence. I&#39;ll listen to any provider of the truth but you have your overblown bias. Pizzagate is one piece  of it all. It involves satanic and pedophile ritual abuse that has not been investigated because &quot;Russia leaked it&quot;</p>

<p>OK you&#39;re right who in their right mind would ever think this guy is a sexual pervert who would be involved in this kind of thing? He&#39;s obviously just a victim.</p>

<p>I pointed out  in the picture that the man you are defending is of the correct mindset to be all that is alleged.</p>

<p>Julian Assange  who is responsible for Wikileaks who published the emails is missing and presumed dead after his internet connection was ordered cut by John Kerry. </p>

<p>The  emails you continue to ignore contain evidence of treason. election rigging by the DNC. and selling favors to enemies  in a pay to play scheme. </p>

<p>The list goes on and on but you automatically ignore and deny because, Russia.  The sources of your knowledge about this have helped tremendously.</p>

<p>These emails are not challenged as not being real there&#39;s just this finger pointing at Russia.</p>

<p>Here are 500 of the emails since I know  you have never read a word in them.  These are from before the Podesta emails that brought you here. but the Podesta emails are more damning. This information was leaked by an outraged staffer, not Russia.</p>

<p>These emails are not challenged as not being real there&#39;s just this finger pointing at Russia.</p>

If you made a statement that did not have your own personal bias added I would be willing to hash this out. Pissa gate is more than substantiated by historical precedent. The Russia hack theory. Almost all computer savvy people use a VPN that routes to Europe. Most notably this idea was purported originally by a person that lied to congress under oath and made lucrative deals with Russia while garnering influence from a US Govt position that she was unqualified for. *spitsatthethoughtofsayingthename</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I wouldn&#39;t qualify him as establishment simply because he&#39;s president-elect. Remember that he overcame basically all odds to win the election. The DNC was against him, the media launched one of the biggest smear campaigns we&#39;ve seen to discredit him, and most of the GOP even refused to support Trump. </p>

<p>As for the FBI, we&#39;re usually against such agencies because they help cover up (or are responsible for) much of the corruption we&#39;re opposed to. Now, however, it appears that there are white hats working behind the scenes to help clean things up. We absolutely welcome this. If they fail to act in the near future, then I guarantee you won&#39;t see many positive FBI posts here. The same logic holds for Trump. If he doesn&#39;t implement any real changes, then this sub will quickly turn on him.</p>

<p>Russian hacking &quot;conspiracy&quot; is not about if Russia did it or not, but the overall impact of the hacking in the elections. Which obviously as a boomerang returns to the establishment figures packaged in the &quot;nothing to hide nothing to fear&quot; paradigm.</p>

<p>though TBH I still do not believe in PG, and consider it akin to David Ike&#39;s reptilian theory</p>

<p>The media just lied and told everyone Hillary had a 95% chance of winning when Vegas was way lower than that.</p>

<p>The CIA lies, the media lies and we know it.</p>

<p>They are also telling us Pizzagate is fake news, without bothering to address the thousands of known victims in protected political pedophilia.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>i mean, this sounds more like anti-conspiracy theory to me.</p>

<p>and you&#39;re not addressing one of the main questions i asked: why believe pizzagate, which has far less reliable data about it and which is far less relevant as a subject, while not believing something as important as Russian campaign interference? </p>

<p>it&#39;s interesting you mention the ODNI: would the ODNI stating Russians <em>did</em> interfere change your opinion?</p>

<p>while you discuss the history of the CIA using public opinion for deception the FBI, the other agency you mention, also has a long history of the same behavior. </p>

<p>while the CIA can&#39;t necessarily divulge a lot of intel to the public without compromising sources of both the US and allies, do you at least agree that the Electoral College should be briefed on the intel?</p>
