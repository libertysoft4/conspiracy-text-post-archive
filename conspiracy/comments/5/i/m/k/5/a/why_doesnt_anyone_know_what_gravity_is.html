    <div class="md"><p>The word gravity is a noun, it is what is known in physics as a &quot;force&quot; which is defined as a vector acting on an object causing acceleration inversely proportional to the object&#39;s mass. </p>

<p>A vector is a mathematical entity with a magnitude  (e.g. 46.5), a unit (e.g. Newton), and a direction (e.g. toward the ground).</p>

<p>Gravitational attraction exists between all objects with mass. </p>

<p>The exact mechanism driving gravitational attraction is not fully understood. </p>

<p>Einstein&#39;s General Theory of Relativity provides a mathematical model for understanding gravity as the bending of spacetime by massive objects (think a bowling ball sitting on a rubber sheet, but in 4 dimensions). </p>

<p>This theory is mathematically useful for predicting astronomical phenomenon, and was further vindicated with the discovery of gravitational waves earlier this year at LIGO (gravitational waves were predicted by Einstein 100 years ago... look into LIGO it&#39;s pretty cool).</p>

<p>But Einstein&#39;s equations conflict with the equations of quantum mechanics, so there must be a gap in our understanding somewhere. But they&#39;re workin on it.</p>

<p>I think it is, but we&#39;re not ready to discard our current erroneous theory. Also I think Einstein was a shill who did not meaningfully contribute to science. His theories are basically based on Lorentz transformations.</p>

<p>Gravity is an effect, and the fact that we ignore electromagnetism in our cosmology when it is a much stronger force than gravity should hint at what&#39;s actually in control. Consider that matter is held together by electromagnetic bonds, both ionic and covalent. Consider plasma is the most common state of matter.</p>

<p>Also the only way to explain gravity waves is if we also accept the existence of an &#39;ether&#39; because waves cannot travel in a vacuum.</p>

<p>But I&#39;ve said enough unpopular opinions.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It is easy to see that the dominant effect influencing astronomical bodies is gravitational, and not electromagnetic. The gravitational force is only attractive. This explains the motion of the astronomical bodies we can see: moons bound to planets, planets bound to stars, and many stars bound together into galaxies.</p>

<p>However, electromagnetism can be attractive or repulsive. Two objects are attracted if they have opposite charge and are repelled if they have negative charge. Taking this into account, electromagnetism could be used to explain the motion of a two body system, such a a planet and its moon. You could just say that the two bodies have opposite charge. </p>

<p>But when you expand to a three body system, you see there is no possible way that all three could be attracted together under electromagnetism. There is no value of charge that the third object could take on to be attracted to both of the other two. And yet we observe systems of many bound astronomical bodies all over the universe i.e. the solar system.</p>

<p>Thus, the force governing the interacting in the example system must be only attractive (gravity).</p>

</blockquote>

<p>This is specious reasoning when chemistry clearly says otherwise. Furthermore, we can use a simpler observation, the magnetic field of a cosmic object is directly proportional to it&#39;s gravitational field where equipped. Black holes emit intense magnetic fields, whereas the moon emits a tiny almost insignificant magnetic field. Jupiter&#39;s magnetic field is stronger than Earth&#39;s, but weaker than the Sun&#39;s. So on and so forth.</p>

<p>Also current gravitational theory can&#39;t explain the fact that the stars at the tips of a spiral galaxy move faster than the stars near the center without inventing things like dark matter and dark energy. But are perfectly accounted for with the electrical model.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Almost every sentence of your post is false. </p>

<p>Chemical bonds are not in any way similar to the gravitational attraction between stars. If stars and planets were bound in probability wavefunctions, then you would have a point, but they are not, and you don&#39;t.</p>

<p>Magnetic fields are not directly proportional to an object&#39;s mass. If you believe they are, then tell me the numerical ratio to convert from mass to magnetic field.</p>

<p>Modern astronomers explain the faster-than-expected motion of stars at the edge of a galaxy through a distribution of &quot;dark matter&quot;, matter which does not interact electromagnetically, but still interacts gravitationally, and possibly weakly. The dark matter still obeys general relativity like all other mass. Extra mass has been observed through gravitational lensing (look up Bullet Cluster), but the particles themselves have not been individually detected.</p>

<p>No &quot;electrical model&quot; can hope to explain the faster-than-expected motion of stars at the edge of a galaxy, because as I stated in my first comment, it fails totally at explaining orbits of many body systems. The stars would simply pair off with oppositely charge stars, and not experience any kind of net attraction into a galactic shape.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There is no direct relationship between an objects mass and the magnetic field it produces. It is entirely possible for a less massive magnet to produce a stronger magnetic field than a more massive magnet. Or for a massive object to have no net magnetic field at all.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Really anything with mass has a gravitational pull. F=G[(m1*m2)/r<sup>2]</sup></p>

<p>G=gravitational constant</p>

<p>M1=mass of object 1</p>

<p>M2=mass of object 2</p>

<p>R=distance between obects</p>

<p>So you have a gravitational pull yourself. Anything with mass does. Just the more mass you have, the more pull you have   </p>

    <div class="md"><p>So is gravity a gradient force or a discreet force? In other words how far away must you be to release yourself from the gravitational influence of a mass? For example we don&#39;t feel the gravity from the sun, yet it&#39;s strong enough to resist the centrifugal force of the Earth as it rotates around it and maintains it in orbit. That doesn&#39;t make much sense to me.</p>

<p>Also consider that 300 miles above the surface of the earth gravity still applies, in other words the ISS is falling back to Earth, much like a zero g plane that simulates weightlessness. The difference is that it&#39;s traveling fast enough for it to fall into the curvature of the earth, in other words it travels fast enough to fall into the horizon.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It is easy to see that the dominant effect influencing astronomical bodies is gravitational, and not electromagnetic. The gravitational force is only attractive. This explains the motion of the astronomical bodies we can see: moons bound to planets, planets bound to stars, and many stars bound together into galaxies.</p>

<p>However, electromagnetism can be attractive or repulsive. Two objects are attracted if they have opposite charge and are repelled if they have negative charge. Taking this into account, electromagnetism could be used to explain the motion of a two body system, such a a planet and its moon. You could just say that the two bodies have opposite charge. </p>

<p>But when you expand to a three body system, you see there is no possible way that all three could be attracted together under electromagnetism. There is no value of charge that the third object could take on to be attracted to both of the other two. And yet we observe systems of many bound astronomical bodies all over the universe i.e. the solar system.</p>

<p>Thus, the force governing the interacting in the example system must be only attractive (gravity).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Almost every sentence of your post is false. </p>

<p>Chemical bonds are not in any way similar to the gravitational attraction between stars. If stars and planets were bound in probability wavefunctions, then you would have a point, but they are not, and you don&#39;t.</p>

<p>Magnetic fields are not directly proportional to an object&#39;s mass. If you believe they are, then tell me the numerical ratio to convert from mass to magnetic field.</p>

<p>Modern astronomers explain the faster-than-expected motion of stars at the edge of a galaxy through a distribution of &quot;dark matter&quot;, matter which does not interact electromagnetically, but still interacts gravitationally, and possibly weakly. The dark matter still obeys general relativity like all other mass. Extra mass has been observed through gravitational lensing (look up Bullet Cluster), but the particles themselves have not been individually detected.</p>

<p>No &quot;electrical model&quot; can hope to explain the faster-than-expected motion of stars at the edge of a galaxy, because as I stated in my first comment, it fails totally at explaining orbits of many body systems. The stars would simply pair off with oppositely charge stars, and not experience any kind of net attraction into a galactic shape.</p>
