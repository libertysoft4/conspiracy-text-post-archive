<p>UNLESS your name is Mike Pence. If you are THAT particular pedo-defender, you go to the White House as VP of the United States:</p>

<p>Quotes:</p>

<p>&quot;Like many Americans and many of my colleagues, I have concerns about how this matter was handled, but speaker Hastert should not resign,&quot; Pence said&quot; regarding the CONVICTED CHILD RAPIST.</p>

<p>&quot;Mike Pence&#39;s statement yesterday supporting House Speaker Hastert is drawing a sharp response from our friend Barry Welsh, another candidate&quot; PENCE called CONVICTED PEDOPHILE DENNIS HASTERT, &quot;A man of integrity.&quot;</p>

<p>Pence then called on Hastert AGAIN to NOT resign and doubled down: Hastert is &quot;a man of integrity that should not resign.&quot;</p>

<p>All his own words, from his local news sources and others.</p>

<p>Pence is so close to pedophilia, and has been given a pass.</p>

<p>So many times, those who claim the most morality have the least.</p>

<p>This is our VP, people.</p>

<p>Pence should be in PRISON, and what the hell does that say about Trump, who chose this Molester Defender to be VP?</p>

<p>This is very ugly.</p>

<p>We will not go away, there are children at stake. I don&#39;t give a flying fuck. Trump and Pence can imprison me and all the others, but the truth will be told. They CANNOT abuse the Children of this Great Nation.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hastert most definitely violated numerous children.</p>

<p>You are incorrect about his indictment, conviction &amp; reasoning behind his jail sentence. <a href="http://apps.washingtonpost.com/g/documents/politics/indictment-of-former-house-speaker-dennis-hastert/1565/">http://apps.washingtonpost.com/g/documents/politics/indictment-of-former-house-speaker-dennis-hastert/1565/</a></p>

<p>I do not support politicians, but I wanted to help your cause, as you are extremely confident in your legal assessment and you are factually incorrect with respect to John Dennis Hastert and the crimes indicated on his indictment.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In October 2015, Hastert entered into a plea agreement with prosecutors. Under the agreement, Hastert pleaded guilty to the &quot;structuring&quot; charge (a felony), and the making false statements charge was dropped. In court submissions on sentencing considerations filed in April 2016, federal prosecutors made allegations of sexual misconduct against Hastert, saying that he had molested at least four boys as young as 14 while he worked as a high school wrestling coach decades earlier. At the sentencing hearing later that month, Hastert admitted under pressure from the judge that he had sexually abused boys. The judge in the case referred to Hastert as a &quot;serial child molester&quot; and imposed a sentence of fifteen months in prison, two years&#39; supervised release, and a $250,000 fine. Hastert is &quot;one of the highest-ranking politicians in American history to be sentenced to prison.&quot; He entered the Federal Medical Center prison in Rochester, Minnesota on June 22, 2016. <sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dennis_Hastert">1</a></sup></p>

my question is time frames of defense, by Pence, of said child molester.
was he convicted at the time of Pence defending him publicly?
or was it directly related to this conviction of pedophila?</p>

<p>regardless, they are all full of shit. 
this whole political bias on this sub is too strong.
too many people have been lead astray by propaganda from both sides.
they are all in it together.

<p>The Instagram pictures they showed were the same two or three that are on every pizzagate thread. The comments were meaningless, as most of them came from other people.

<p>What parts of any of that were wrong?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, she&#39;s a bit of a hypocrit, because she was a big deal during the presidential debates. She built herself up to be this powerful, strong woman who asked Donald Trump the tough questions as a debate moderator and they marketed her as a warrior of truth. Then, when the time <em>really</em> calls for tough questions, she&#39;s all sympathetic to this poor pizza shop owner who is one of the wealthiest and most powerful men in the city, and glazes over his scandal. She&#39;s so full of shit, it&#39;s obvious, and I believe she is well aware of what she is covering for. You can see her fake/overacting in her responses and her handling of the conversation with James...Sick.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, they showed that one and he said it was innocent and that was his goddaughter. </p>

<p>One of the things they like doing is indignantly stating the relationship they have to their alleged victim, scoffing at the question, as though the nature of the relationship makes any accusations totally absurd and fantastical.   Anyone can look up the most basic information about child abuse and figure out it&#39;s most frequently perpetrated by someone that has access to the child, that the parents trust and has a relationship with the child.  You&#39;d think they&#39;d bother to look this shit up and adjust their lies but I guess they are sticking to what&#39;s been proven to work.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s an interview with a sexual offender where he first gives his cover story so you can see him spin his lie then admits and talks openly about his crimes.  <a href="https://youtu.be/0sEqWlJbEX4?t=36s">sex, lies and sex offenders</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>None of the tweets from the people there mentioned hearing shots till after police said there were shots and they were referenced as such.  So there was some thought here that he never fired a shot because people would have been tweeting that if he did, or hell even if he knocked over something that made a loud bang; AR-15s are loud as hell, if that is what he had on him. That being said the place holds a lot of concerts so they may have some decent sound proofing and he did have a sidearm that may have been fairly silent too.</p>

<p>Systems of control. Used to be you were a commie. Later on, you could be exposed as gay. Now, the stakes are raised even higher.</p>

<p>Just playing devil&#39;s advocate a bit. But yeah, if he really angered the powers that be, there would be no way to hush things up.</p>
