<p>And that is the <em>very</em> reason why we need to keep doing everything we possibly can to blow this wide open and expose <em>everyone</em>.  If we&#39;re wrong? then we look &quot;stooopid&quot;.  Big fucking deal.  I don&#39;t give a fuck about that, because if we&#39;re <em>right?</em> then that means that literally <em>the</em> most absolutely valuable and vulnerable members of the entire human species - its children - are getting their lives destroyed by these elite pedophile pieces of absolute filth...and putting a stop to that is worth almost any sacrifice that can be made as far as I&#39;m concerned.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I would have to agree with you. The weird thing is that I can&#39;t believe that one doesn&#39;t wants to take this into consideration.

That was reported by Anderson Cooper. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>So do you instead mean in your above sentence that the weird thing is that you can&#39;t believe one DOESN&#39;T want to take this (i.e. that pizzagate just might in fact have to do with actual pedophilia) into consideration?</p>

<p>If so, then yeah.  On one level, I don&#39;t disagree.  For the record, there are indeed more and more people that are in fact beginning to take seriously where all the incriminating information seems to be leading.  On another level, however, I can also see how many are still blind (willingly or otherwise) considering that the (possible) perpetrators of these crimes are amongst the most powerful corporate entities on the planet - entities who own the mainstream media and all but control the public&#39;s mind and perception.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sorry I should of proof read, because I meant to put doesn&#39;t. I fixed it though. I agree that this is something a lot of people are starting to take serious.

<p>Can&#39;t agree more.  Again, it&#39;s vitally important.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>I&#39;d certainly hope so, but I think the rabbit hole is SOOO deep on this one, and the powers involved and implicated are <em>so</em> powerful, that they might just be capable of starting WWIII just to distract and take attention away from more deeply investigating this issue rather than allow too much information to be revealed.</p>

<p>This is why, as you&#39;ve just said above here, we need to remain <em>very</em> concentrated and vigilant about getting to the bottom of this and NOT lose focus.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ya the rabbit hole could go very deep into this one. It could almost be just on a total global scale too. Who really knows. I mean it&#39;s not like these practice haven&#39;t been around before. This was prevalent in greek culture. That&#39;s what Antinous story is all about. Then you have people who get really weird with it like Aleister Crowley. He&#39;s one interesting character to say the least. We need to keep spreading a discussion on this.

<p><em>Could?</em>  Oh it absolutely <em>is</em> global.  100% no questions asked.  People from all over the world are victims of a deep racket of exploitation.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Yes.  Absolutely.  Agreed.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Then we will finally shut up about it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Well…it depends on what that truth ultimately is actually.  If the ACTUAL truth is that there is no pedophilia racket and it’s just occasional, random, unrelated criminals events that take place, then okay.  Prosecute and punish the criminals, and we’ll “shut up” about it.  However, if the truth is that there is an organized pedophilia racket being perpetrated by some of the most powerful figures on the planet? then I don’t think we should shut up about it <em>at all.</em>  I think the entire human population needs to come together as one and fucking RID the planet of these figures.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I never said any of this was evidence that could be used to bring them down. This is just more to provoke thought of what actually could be happening. There is just huge amount of weirdness going on with this story. The reason we are saying we want an investigation is because we want to know the truth. The emails seem like they are talking in code. Podesta is friends with Hasting who was busted for pedophilia. James Alafantis twitter picture is of Antinous who was a greek child used for pleasure of high greek members. I mean doesn&#39;t that seem a little too coincidental. Also with places like Canada, Norway, and Australia being busted with these practices shouldn&#39;t we at least look into this a little further.</p>
