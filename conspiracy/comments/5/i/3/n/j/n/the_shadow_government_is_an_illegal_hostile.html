<ol>
<li>) They were declared a universal-fascist, foreign national intelligence contractor on 9/11 when the Continuity of Government plan was set into action by Richard Clarke and Dick Cheney.</li>
<li>) This COG plan makes the Intelligence community extraconstitutional</li>
<li>) Extraconstititonal means foreign.  No longer part of the public government.<br/></li>
<li>) <a href="https://webbrain.com/brainpage/brain/2E468BC6-2D8A-9E60-A281-E96CA47AD83E">Continuity of Government Research Nexus</a></li>
<li>) Congresspeople and SCOTUS who have been cuckholded by this are not allowed into the COG meetings.</li>
<li>) These people are told &quot;don&#39;t ask about COG&quot;.  It&#39;s under &quot;secret law&quot;.<br/></li>
<li>) &quot;Secret law&quot; is code word for &quot;they are not operating under the Constititon&quot;, and therefore they are &quot;a foreign government&quot;---a &quot;Shadow Government&quot;.<br/></li>
<li>) Because in the US &quot;secret law&quot; is not legal or legitimate.<br/></li>
<li>) In the US, the Constitituon and the bill of rights (amendments) is the <strong><em>highest law of the land</em></strong>.  Secret law isn&#39;t higher than the Constitution.</li>
<li>) There is no constitutional &#39;executive orders&#39; that can declare &quot;secret law&quot; as legitimate.  Our president isn&#39;t some kind of space emperor or god-emperor.</li>
<li>) &quot;Secret Law&quot; being legitimate is as laughable as me claiming to be be a magistrate of <em>interdimensional law</em>, and claiming ultimate dominion over all other dimensions.  Btw, I hereby claim dominion and sovereignty over all other dimensions. </li>
<li>) The Constititon has jurisdiction because of Popular Sovereignty, it&#39;s a social contract.  We agreed to it like it&#39;s a EULA for citizenship.<br/></li>
<li>)  <strong><em>Secret law is not in that contract!</em></strong></li>
<li>)  Popular sovereignty on wikipedia:</li>
</ol>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;The American Revolution marked a departure in the concept of popular sovereignty as it had been discussed and employed in the European historical context. <strong><em>With their Revolution, Americans substituted the sovereignty in the person of King George III, with a collective sovereign—composed of the people. Thenceforth, American revolutionaries generally agreed and were committed to the principle that governments were legitimate only if they rested on popular sovereignty – that is, the sovereignty of the people.</em></strong> (bitch!) [c] This idea—often linked with the notion of the consent of the governed—was not invented by the American revolutionaries. Rather, the consent of the governed and the idea of the people as a sovereign had clear 17th and 18th century intellectual roots in English history.[5]&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>15.</strong>) We didn&#39;t agree to secret law, we didn&#39;t even know about it!  And they won&#39;t tell us about it.  We had to find out..  That means it&#39;s illegitimate.  There is no popular sovereignty basis for something we don&#39;t even know about!</p>

<p><strong>16.</strong> ) This means that the CIA/NSA cannot declare psychological operations against the US Citizens, nor can it wage psychological warfare against the US, nor can it attack and kill US citizens, nor can it spy on them illegally as it had done and be Constitutional.</p>

<p><strong>17.</strong> ) Therefore, the US intelligence community is NO LONGER A PART OF THE PUBLIC US GOVERNMENT.  </p>

<p><strong>18.</strong>) It is a &quot;shadow government&quot; (by the FBI&#39;s own words), and that doesn&#39;t mean they are <em>&quot;hiding inside our government&quot;</em>, it means they are <em>&quot;hiding OUTSIDE of our government&quot;</em>.  It means they are their own government, not unlike Israel, or Saudi, or Canada.  They are the united states of global intelligence.  They are basically Odessa.</p>

<p><strong>19.</strong> ) This also means that the US Government have been at perpetual war with the US Intelligence Community, and that the US Government, by approving their funding, has been giving money to a hostile enemy government, so the whole government is a guilty of treason, not the CIA/NSA.  They are actually a foreign hostile nation that has attacked civilians, which means they are guilty of International War Crimes, Human Rights Abuses, and should be dismantled immediately and every human person, software agent, system or hardware who participated in making them a shadow government arrested / dismantled for high treason.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Mossad is an israeli branch of british intelligence.  Israel being only 80 yrs old is not richer than an empire that&#39;s run an opium/sugar/spices/etc-mercantile trade for 2000 yrs and was itself at that point an annex of rome.</p>

<p>And british intelligence is a branch of the vatican; given that Queen Elizabeth II is a knight.  Oh?  you didn&#39;t know?  She&#39;s a Knight of Malta.  To become a knight you have to bend the knee and so that means she bent her knee to the Vatican.</p>

<p><em>Empire of the City</em> is real.  London, DC, Vatican.  With satellite cities.  Russia is to be Rome4  then it will be globalrome.  This is a follow the money type situation.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>At the very top is the Khazarian Mafia from what I have been researching here. This mafia includes a lot of big boys from all those countries you mentioned including the Bushs, Rothschild, Netenyahu, and I&#39;m pretty sure the Pope but I haven&#39;t found much about the Pope so far. This group hails from the ancient country of Khazar and fakes being a different religion to fit in with the world and infiltrate its positions of authority. They have Israel, the UK, and US easy right now plus they hold power in every other country to some extent. I&#39;m just not sure if Trump is one of theirs or if he really is one of us. </p>

<p>Also, word is that they are in panic mode. 2016 was a hell of a bad year for business according to the Khazarian Mafia. Unveiling them is the death of them so we need to keep digging into this until all is known. </p>

<p>Exactly.  This kind of thing is absolutely unheard of, and is intolerable.  It&#39;s giving them <em>carte blanche</em>.  You can&#39;t give people getting trillions in funding carte blanche and expect them to not to abuse it, and you, in the very worst possible ways.  They&#39;ve had a long time to prove their trustworthiness and judging from the &#39;list of confirmed conspiracies&#39; in the sidebar, they&#39;ve utterly failed that measure.  I see that their accomplishments are only death, destruction and ruin of the world around them, making the global everyperson much less safe, much less happy, much less propserous or enlightened.  Their &#39;great work&#39; will be total technocracy / technoneofeudalism if you let them do it.</p>

I&#39;m not aware of the exact wording of the order that begins cog but it seems they feel they have found a loophole with the state of emergency declared on 911 and continued by executive order every year. So I believe the cog will remain until the acting president decides to discontinue. </p>

<p>But that&#39;s part of the problematic next step. They are planting every president as well. They will not even allow a non-establishment campaigner to get close to the main election! Look what happened to Bernie Sanders. He was obviously psyopped into actually announcing his support for Hillary under gritted teeth and steaming frustration.</p>

<p>Trump was buddies with Hillary and Netanyahu before he ran, but I suspect he still had a bit of innocence/naivete. I think deep down he convinced himself that he could <em>drain the swamp</em>, lying to himself in the process. </p>

<p>He knew how these sick elite operate. They had Obama deliver the protocol when Trump was welcomed to the White House, on NATIONAL TV. Trump ain&#39;t no actor, so couldn&#39;t hide his shock.</p>

<p>Speculation: Trump was likely told, <em>this is how it&#39;s going to go whether you like it or not. Don&#39;t worry if you follow their program, you and your family will be rich beyond belief and you&#39;ll be above the law.</em> </p>

<p>Check out the photos, post-meeting, Trump looks like a deer in headlights. Obama is smiling and thinking &quot;keep it together man&quot;.</p>

<li>Truth about 9/11 and how you can&#39;t do anything about it.</li>
<li>Something really weird like alien disclosure and how you can&#39;t do anything about it.</li>
<li>Nazis, and you can&#39;t do anything about it.</li>
<li>Obama reveals to Trump was right about Obama&#39;s birth certificate (CIA) and can&#39;t do anything about it</li>
<li>Obama reveals to Trump that Obama has been used as Cheese Pizza his whole life and that he loves his molesters because they made him president, but now he&#39;s sorry it did a bad job and wants Trump to help him stage a final psyop / win so he can leave in non-disgrace.  Trump just sighed and put his head down.</li>

    <div class="md"><p>I suspect that you are somewhat right.  That the constitution exists as lip service and that there have been loopholes determined within it or that nullify it.</p>

<p>Certain contents of the NDAA and Patriot Act (215, for instance) lead me to believe that there are a set of legal documents which currently supercede the constitution according to the courts.  Perhaps we are living under military law.  It&#39;s not a surprise that the majority of people in high levels of unelected government happen to be a lawyers.</p>

<p>But at the same time- law and government, like the markets, require the trust and BELIEF of the people (like a religion).  I&#39;m not an anarchist, and I believe in the concept of government and in many of the people in our government- but a government that is untrustworthy becomes a problem.  If you don&#39;t want people to know about Rex84, then there should be no such thing as Rex84:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The plan was first revealed in detail in a major daily newspaper by reporter Alfonso Chardy in the July 5 1987 edition of the Miami Herald. Possible reasons for such a roundup were reported to be widespread opposition to a U.S. military invasion abroad, such as if the United States were to directly invade Central America.[1][2][3] To combat what the government perceived as &quot;subversive activities&quot;, the plan also authorized the military to direct ordered movements of civilian populations at state and regional levels, according to Professor Diana Reynolds.[4]</p>

<p>I think that&#39;s the other suggestion of COG, is that martial law was declared and that they (media) simply doesn&#39;t know or doesn&#39;t advertise it.  This would mean a media blackout on the idea for 16 yrs.  Think about that.</p>

<p>Also, good on you for the rex84.  I believe that&#39;s the first article that led me to know about the continuity of government.  </p>

<p>If you watch &quot;Orange is the New Black&quot; in one of their season the prisoners are given a &quot;garden plot&quot; which is the subject of a &quot;garden plot&quot;, with a reference to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Garden_Plot">&quot;operation garden plot&quot;</a> (martial law/state of emergency plan similar to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rex_84">rex84</a>).  You know about this because that &#39;garden plot&#39; episode involved one &#39;crazy conspiracy theorist&#39; on the show, played by &quot;tank girls&quot;&#39;s Lori Petty, who was in jail for attacking people she thought were &quot;government agents that were after her&quot;, always looking around her for drones.  </p>

<p>She whistleblew on Rex84, the garden plot, in orange is the new black, which I though was remarkably <em>subversive</em>, given the censors.  I was delighted because most of what Lori Petty&#39;s character said was actually true, but people were treating her like she was crazy (well, she was in fact)...and I thought this was interesting because they whisleblew some truth mixed with anticonspiracy theorist attack propaganda at the same time, giving you a kind of red pill blue pill moment.</p>

<p>wow- i didn&#39;t even make that connection!  of course that&#39;s a reference to &quot;Garden Plot&quot;! That show is terrible after season 1, but there are some good subversive references in it, in particular to the issues regarding prison privatization.</p>

<p>she was clearly a bit paranoid schizophrenic.  conspiracy theories bring out a lot of them, who associate macro conspiracies with their own micro-paranoias.  Even on this sub, we have many &quot;targeted individuals&quot; who offer a lot of good insights, but should probably stick to their meds.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>True about your last point, but we need to get to a place where we can provide people with a formal process to determine if they are targetted or crazy.  You see, you can&#39;t prove a negative, and therefore the absence of evidence is not evidence of absence.  In this context, we know that they have electrical weapons that can affect people&#39;s biology, that can induce seizures, directed energy weapons to cause paranoia, hallucinations, etc.  So how do you distinguish between the source of these manifestation (ie ones own biology versus a weapon)?  You can&#39;t at present.  That&#39;s the problem </p>

<p>We need to have scientific processes for helping people discover if they have something in the environment causing them to have these problems.  Maybe they have an electrical sensitivity like that guy on Better Call Saul.  Maybe they have a bad bearing in their HVAC system causing &#39;bad physical vibrations / mechanical resonances that are at a frequency that negatively impact a person biologically&#39;.</p>

<p>Targetted energy weapons are real, we know this.  We know they&#39;ve had limited deployment.  We know they&#39;ve the ability to target 10cm<sup>2</sup> on the earth from space, perhaps better than that.  </p>

<p>I wish we could all have a grown up conversation about these types of weapons and create tools to detect their usage upon us and possibly countermeasures if we find that their use is random and/or widespread.</p>

<p>&quot;If people need to hear that there are particular programs that are achieving that objective, I suppose that&#39;s desirable,&quot; she added. <em>&quot;But for them to think that there&#39;s something conspiratorial, or that there&#39;s something underhanded about [COG], or that there&#39;s something circumventing the Constitution, would be a great disservice. This is done, I think, by the book — as it should be.&quot;</em></p>

<p>In other words: &quot;If you suspected that we were doing what some people involved fully intend on doing, that would greatly hurt their aims.&quot; </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Wait and hope and see what Trump does.  If he does nothing, then then next person to go to court ought to challenge the courts jursidiction on the basis that the constitution has been superceded by the cia, and so there are either 1) no laws / courts that are legit if the CIA is NOT a private group and secret law has been illegitimately legitimized and therefore you&#39;re free to go, 2) laws are in place which means that the court system and the entire US government has committed acts of terrorism and therefore they&#39;re in breach of public contract and thusly dissolved: either way, laws won&#39;t apply to you or anyone else in america, if they don&#39;t apply to the government itself, and so you make that legal argument.</p>

<p>But you know another thing can be done which is that someone can make a corporation that declares itself a microstate outside of the US, and then all US citizens can be shareholders of it, but it&#39;s a true democracy and built into their charter is equal and fractional ownership which guarantees protections.  Then you no longer have to pay taxes because every time you do anything publicly or financially you can be &#39;doing business as&#39; the microstate corporation....this is basically what corporations do, currently, to invert and avoid taxes.  Everything you buy woudl be through that. Also it might provide you legal protections under maritime admiralty law, by superceding or allowing pepole to &#39;opt out&#39; of common law system altogether by being &#39;agents of the corporation&#39; and relinquishing their citizenry and corporate definiton of themselves (all caps name)--that&#39;s the whole freeman thing</p>

<p>So essentially if Trump doesn&#39;t get rid of inversion, everyone should create their own people&#39;s union outside of the US and then enjoy the same exploits that businesses enjoy.</p>

<p>Then he&#39;ll have no choice to retract and legislate it.</p>

<p>You see the way you break the control is to compete with it.  Time to stop being a pussy everyone and start using the same underhanded, unethical but totally legal contrivances that corpoprations enjoy.  Because when there&#39;s a sea change and people use these services <em>en masse</em> it totally breaks the government.</p>

<p>That&#39;s the only way you can do it.  Is to go towards legal means that break stuff and deprive them from funding</p>
