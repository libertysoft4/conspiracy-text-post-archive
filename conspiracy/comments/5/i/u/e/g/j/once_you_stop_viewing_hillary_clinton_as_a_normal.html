<p>If you know you&#39;re going to jail, you have nothing to lose by attempting to overturn a fairly won election or incite public hysteria by suggesting Trump&#39;s a Russian plant. Who cares this could cause a civil war when you&#39;re going to jail anyway?</p>

<p>How does that relate to the previous analogy?  I still don&#39;t understand the point of the analogy and how they relate?</p>

<blockquote>

<p>No, it does not.  I already believe this to be the case though, for many years.  I find it non-coincidental that when I start working on music Hulu plays an add me and my roommates have never seen about a new laptop with special music apps.</p>

<p>Or that when my girlfriend comes over it starts playing adds about boyfriends buying their girlfriend lingerie.</p>

<p>Or when I talk about a game, and then my laptop gets a bunch of ads for said game that is years old.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No. That is not exactly what happened.</p>

<p>Honest people have looked into leaked emails, and figured there is a code system regarding pizza.</p>

<p>From there they followed the pizza place most often mentioned in the emails.</p>

<p>This led to the pizza place owner&#39;s Instagram account, which seemed to have many vague and coded references in regards to children. Children who aren&#39;t even eating pizza in the pics. The pictures are weird, especially if they are supposed to be normal marketing social media pics for a normal family pizza place.</p>

<p>JimmyComet is disturbing. Every single comment on his IG uis disturbing. #killroom? #chickenlover on the pic of a man holding a baby in the backroom/kitchen of the restaurant - not eating chicken? There are thousands of comments sigh as these connected to this - </p>

<p>Don&#39;t act like this shit came out of nothing.</p>

<p>Oh yeah - and where is the nightly news evidence for ANY of the shit being reported these days. R/conspiracy has more facts and  verification than r/politics or any MSM program. I guarantee it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I realize there is a tendency for some people to accept theories as facts, especially given the election season and whatnot. But this brand of concern trolling is toxic and disruptive and it does not have much of a place on this board.</p>

<p>No we should not accept theory as fact, and we should also not dismiss theory offhandedly. </p>

<p>The only people who could deny that there has been a hostile presence on this forum recently are members of that hostile presence and very new members. This presence quite often takes the form of comments dismissing any conspiracy theory based on lack of evidence or the seeming absurdity of the theory. Particularly noticeable with pizzagate threads.</p>

<p>I believe this hostility could be reasonably attributed to perfectly innocent factors, but I also believe that it is absolutely not impossible that it is organized as part of a conspiracy.</p>

<p>That is what this forum is all about - protecting the rights of an organized group to discuss these things openly. And these kinds of priveleges are easy to abuse by meddling outsiders who want to shut down conversation about a certain topic. This is not in the spirit of this sub.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Dude, fuck these guys. This is a place for all thoughts and opinions to be heard. This is a place where nothing is absolute. No one knows what is really going on except the elites responsible. </p>

<p>At this point, it <em>is</em> <strong>undeniable</strong> that the public is being fed a load of bullshit and lies. This sub is dedicated to speculating the reality behind the curtain. Any and every theory could be possible until proven false. That&#39;s what this sub is about.</p>

<p>We have seen a growing hostility from the MSM and elites toward some recent, popular, and very convincing conspiracies. They refuse to acknowledge anything that goes against their agenda, and they have a terrifying record of silencing dissenters. We are reaching a point that the MSM, proven to be the propaganda front of the Democratic party by Wikileaks, is attempting to define &quot;truth.&quot; This is very dangerous, and you are right to feel &quot;crazy&quot; or afraid. But it&#39;s up to us to remind them that we&#39;re not as stupid as they think. We&#39;re not falling for their bullshit. We&#39;re not falling in line. And until they take every last one of us, there will always be a voice for reason and logic and free thought.</p>

<p>Everyone is stuck in their echo chambers and are unwilling to accept any idea that goes against their agenda, and feel the need to silence different opinions. Keep speaking out. </p>

<p>Your &#39;it fits&#39; logic is nonsense.  So is your &#39;but we were right about something in the past&#39; logic. </p>

<p>You need to make two major changes in your life if you want to be better at identifying actual conspiracies instead of just taking stabs in the dark:</p>

<p>1) You need to start noticing things that don&#39;t happen as much as things that do happen.  Humans didn&#39;t evolve to notice non-connections and non-patterns, this isn&#39;t as easy as it seems, but it&#39;s truly what separates the boys from the men.</p>

<p>2) You need to separate your sense of identity from your beliefs.  So if you believe something and new evidence comes to light that no longer supports that belief, it&#39;s easier for you to modify that belief.</p>

<p>Give us evidence, not this &#39;but it fits&#39; nonsense.</p>

<p>It is far fetched but there is nothing to disprove it and it has not been disproven despite what Snopes and Poltifact tell you. Nothing is dead to rights obviously but the coincidences still exist. Their are sex trafficking rings all over the world including the United States.

<p>Show me the evidence. Anything I can find about it is just the WaPo saying they have unnamed sources. </p>

<p>The CIA and the FBI declined to comment on Brennan’s message or on the classified intelligence assessment that CIA officials shared with members of the Senate Intelligence Committee earlier this month, setting off a political firestorm.</p>

<p>A few days after the Senate briefing, a senior FBI counter­intelligence official briefed the House Intelligence Committee but was not as categorical as the CIA briefer about Russia’s intention to help Trump, according to officials who were present. The FBI official’s more cautious presentation of the intelligence to the House panel left some Republican and Democratic lawmakers in the room with the impression that the FBI disagreed with the CIA.</p>

<p>FBI disagreed with the CIA.</p>

<p>Julian Assange has verified that it was not state actors that leaked the emails to him but would not go any further than that. John Podesta pretty much calls out Eric Braverman for being the leaker in his emails and now Braverman has been missing for 30 days. Julian Assange and wikileaks have a flawless record. They have never lied or been wrong for the ten years they have been out. Sorry if I believe them more than the CIA whose sole purpose is to deceive. </p>

<p>Julian Assange does say though that all governments are constantly hacking eachother for various purposes. So I am not saying that Russia isn&#39;t actively trying to penetrate our information, just that there is no evidence that this was them. John Podesta clicked on a shady &quot;change your password&quot; email. You didn&#39;t a state sponsored hacker group to get in. The guy is an idiot with zero sense of cyber security. </p>

<p>Secondly, the DNC was hacked/leaked way before Trump was considered a serious candidate for president. </p>

<p>Thanks. I am just pointing a double standard. People will somehow still believe the true/false verdicts of the media just because they are the media. Most of these journalists have no more access to information that the average person anymore. It is not enough to just take someone&#39;s word for it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I said &quot;If there really is no evidence...&quot; so if there is evidence then it&#39;s fine to put on the frontpage of whatever paper. I assume there is probably some way to determine where the hack originated from and multiple govt agencies have said the evidence points to Russia. Of course if this is propaganda then we shouldn&#39;t act on it but that&#39;s a different matter. I have yet to see even remotely convincing evidence supporting &quot;pizzagate&quot; so it&#39;s in a totally different ballpark</p>

    <div class="md"><p>One doesn&#39;t justify the other though. The DNC, for better or worse, is an independent organisation that can <em>and will</em> work towards the benefit of its key members.

<p>What you&#39;re suggesting is high treason that would involve hundreds of people, some of whom would consider themselves decent patriots. Do you honestly believe that&#39;s what&#39;s going on behind closed doors? Has Hilary Clinton committed crimes? Probably. Is she pulling the strings behind the scenes, trying to frame a country and overthrow a democratically elected president? Probably not. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That wasn&#39;t a silly conspiracy, it was obvious. We just didn&#39;t have proof until the hacks </p>

<p>But why anti Hillary still? Even if the electoral college goes against Trump, it won&#39;t be for Hillary.</p>

<p>Oh, right, this is a distraction post from all the criminal enterprises and conflicts of interest of TRUMP.</p>

<p>Because &quot;omg hill gave secret wall Street speeches&quot; doesn&#39;t work as an argument when Trump appoints well Street execs to his cabinet.</p>

<p>&quot;Omg crooked Hillary on bed with oil lobbyists&quot; doesn&#39;t work when Trump appoints the CEO of EXXON to his staff, who praises Putin and stated he doesn&#39;t have the USA interest as top priority, just his own.</p>

<p>So how about stfu about how bad Hillary is, because the REAL info on her is bad enough that the BULLSHIT isn&#39;t necessary.</p>

<p>How about focus on the CRIMINAL THAT WON</p>

<p>Fucking disinfo if I ever saw it. One year ago you tell this sub that the Russians will infiltrate our elections and y&#39;all have a conspiracy boner. It happens, and it was Trump they choose to support, and suddenly &quot;why do we even think Russia is so bad?&quot;</p>

<p>Lol u lost, Libfag, see u in 4 years!! </p>

<p>Some of us actually care about the tangible results that effect people in real life.</p>

<p>And now that you can&#39;t bash Hillary anymore, you got nothing. Fucking nothing. But go on and bash Hillary for the entire 4 years of Trump while he fucks over everyone you know. Yeeeeeehawww librul tears!!!!</p>

<p>Hillary was the worst candidate ever, literally the only person that could lose to a con man like Trump.</p>

<p>So get over it, and deal with the reality of the crook that DID win rather than the crook that DIDN&#39;T Win.</p>

<p>3) Are you kidding? I&#39;m going to love making fun of Trump. The &quot;unpresident&quot; tweet today is a good start. But what is there to focus on right now? What if his &quot;terrible&quot; cabinet picks turn out to be awesome? Who the hell knows how this is going to turn out with the way this has all went down.

<p>2) my point was: all of this bizarre shit going on right now would be explained by Hillary being afraid she&#39;s going to jail. </p>

<p>when have we ever seen someone push for the Electoral College to flip in a fair election? We&#39;ve had the internet for years, but suddenly FAKE NEWS is a problem we need addressed? Who the fuck accuses the FBI of working with Russia? Hillary Clinton does. This Russia boogeyman shit out of nowhere is a stupid fearmongering tactic to scare the public from supporting Trump. And it&#39;s all pathetic desperation that can be explained by her fearing she&#39;s going to jail for her Clinton Foundation bullshit.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t agree with this post either (Trump isn&#39;t going after Clinton now that he won), but it is also true that having a hypothesis is useful even if it is wrong. When you have a theory you can look at the weakest part and test it rather than trying to put all the peices together at once. The real question is how geniuses form their hypotheses, which I don&#39;t think is ever going to be fully understood.</p>

<p>Regarding the media hysteria of the past few weeks: it seems to me to be just hot air with no actual purpose other than distraction from a loss that was embarrassing to the political establishment, the media, intelligence agencies, and the donors. A lot can be learned from this election (chiefly that the electoral college needs to go, as even Trump concedes) and they are invested in keeping the system intact through division.</p>

I&#39;d say to quit troubling yourself with politics since things are insane right now but I&#39;ve been finding it difficult to take that suggestion myself.  I&#39;m pretty sure most people share some of the same sentiments if we were somehow able to refocus on our own realities.  Theres a war on truth and it should be pretty obvious if you consider wikileaks for a moment with a skeptical mind.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Exactly! I find the Hilary&#39;s corrupt argument doesn&#39;t really hold any water when it&#39;s compared to Trump. His conflicts of interest are 10x worse than hers. She is an awful candidate and represents everything that is wrong with the American political system but she still isn&#39;t as bad as trump. I would really love to be proven wrong and have a civil meaningful discussion about this. If anyone disagrees with me explain why. </p>

<p>What I want people here to understand is that they are smarter than us at hiding things.  The only thing that we can do is follow the money and trust that the people over our heads are doing the same.  The circumstantial evidence is just that--circumstantial.  But if you look how deep some of it goes it is enough for an intelligent mind to entertain without dismissing entirely.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s funny how you&#39;re assuming that because I loathe Hillary Clinton, I must think Trump is the shit. Trump is a fucking moron who swept into power because in 2010 SCOTUS ruled that money is the same thing as free speech. Without the fucking disastrous Citizens United decision, the Koch brothers wouldn&#39;t have been able to create the Tea Party movement, and without the Tea Party movement, the extremist views that got Trump elected would not have become so popular. </p>

<p>Citizens United also helped to create the Hillary nomination. She is an awful, unlikable, and thoroughly unappealing politician--the only reason she managed to secure so much support is because wealthy string-pullers like Soros were able to legally spend unlimited sums of money to put her in a spoon, make airplane noises, and force her down the throat of the cringing democratic masses. Fucking crazy. </p>

<p>So to answer your weird question: to make America &quot;great again&quot; I would start by repealing Citizens United. If Americans are given back the right to choose their own leadership without the influence billions of dollars of special interest money, then a lot of things would sort themselves out. </p>

<p>Edit: I&#39;m not even a US citizen and I find the whole thing deeply offensive. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I wasn&#39;t really trying to take a side, only wanted to point out that you can frame the discussion in different ways to make each side look worse in turn.  I mean you even did that in your comment:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I&#39;d argue that governmental corruption at the highest level is a little worse than some offensive speak in private or shady business practices, but each person has their &#39;team&#39; to step up to bat for.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I mean come on, obviously the problem with Trump and what&#39;s going on right now goes a <em>little bit</em> deeper than &quot;some offensive speak in private or shady business practices.&quot;  That&#39;s framing, you made the argument about something other than what the mainstream argument is and tried to pass your version off as the real one.  If all I&#39;ve done is proved both sides have an argument then shit I&#39;m happy because they <em>do</em> both have an argument.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>no that&#39;s just my personal opinion about it. It is no more valid than anybody else&#39;s and i&#39;m sorry if I came off differently. That&#39;s why I said &#39;I&#39;d argue&#39; - I wasn&#39;t saying i was right.</p>

<p>Also, I don&#39;t quite what you&#39;re getting at and maybe i&#39;m missing something. What do you mean going a &#39;little bit deeper&#39;?</p>

<p>It&#39;s pretty clear what&#39;s going on if you actually read articles and look at what people who matter are saying. Trump may have spoken with Russian intelligence and they may have worked together in some capacity, but they had a common enemy. Hilary Clinton had stood on a platform of aggression towards Russia in regards to the Syrian conflict and I don&#39;t think it should be held against them that they preferred Trump as she was openly intimating towards war with them.</p>

<p>The FBI and CIA agree that the most likely source of the hacks was the Russian government, but considering the missteps that Clinton, Podesta, and the DNC took in having unsecured servers and insufficient security on their communications means that almost anybody could have gotten access to this information. The leaked info has not been debunked or proven false at all. Russia uncovered dirt and delivered it for Trump&#39;s benefit - I totally agree with that.</p>

<p>As far as &#39;fairness&#39; and dirt on Trump, i&#39;m honestly starting to wonder if we&#39;ve heard the absolute worst of it. This guy has been a joke in the public eye for almost 20 years. When it came time for the Dems to take a real shot at him, the worst they could do was some &#39;locker room talk&#39; that was abhorrent but we&#39;ve all said some stupid things that we&#39;d probably not like repeated. My point is more that claims against Clinton are not relate-able to a regular person nearly as much as Trump&#39;s gaffes.</p>

<p>On top of that, there is a good reason that the FBI didn&#39;t reject the information about Clinton as well. The FBI is there to protect the country, and it seems pretty clear that Clinton used the DNC to ensure her nomination in the election. This is one small step away from trying to steal an election, so you have to to believe the FBI was interested in seeing what was going on. I think Clinton has been fairly well protected over the years, but Trump has always been free season to slam ever since he said he wanted to run for president back in the 90s. There is not much ammo left to shoot at Trump, while Clinton seems to have an endless supply left to go through...  But again, just my opinion.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>To be completely fair, we don&#39;t know how much of that was true and how much was ridiculous posturing. Considering the context, taking that conversation overly seriously is a bit of a stretch (again, in my opinion). That does not excuse what he said or the views that he expressed, but I can also understand if there was some hyperbole there. So fair enough - rather than &#39;locker room talk&#39;, what would we call it tho? Bragging over things that may or may not have happened? Do people always tell the truth when they&#39;re bragging about their sexual exploits? </p>

<p>The uncertainty goes both ways. If we shouldn&#39;t jump to indict Clinton, then we should wait for some legitimate charges towards Trump too before we start calling him a sexual criminal. However, they are totally different charges, which was more my original point. Trump has only actually be proven guilty of some shady business practice and paying people off in the court systems - whether that means he was guilty of things before is not certain as we know people get extorted as well. Maybe some were legitimate and others were not. All we can know for sure is what is on record. Trump&#39;s not a great person and certainly not of the character we&#39;d wish for in a president, but Clinton had shown a clear willingness to try to usurp power and I think people are grossed out by that today. The USA was founded in rejection of oligarchy and monarchy - the idea that you had to be born from a certain stock or family to make a difference in the world. If Clinton had won, the last 30+ years of the US Presidency would have been held by 3 family names, and when people started to see her as corrupt, it was over. Corruption is no joke - it even overpowers gender discrimination and racist appeals with its vileness. The 21st Century world is allergic to it, IMO, but that&#39;s a larger discussion....</p>

<p>In the end, I hear your point on both sides being a perspective. I just don&#39;t think there&#39;s a right one of the choices available.</p>

I personally don&#39;t like using locker room talk because I think it&#39;s deceptive, as a male I have never experienced anything close to that in a locker room or in &quot;guy talk&quot; or whatever, no one casually talks about sexual assault even as a joke.  I mean is Trump an evil serial sex abuser?  Hell no.  Is he a sociopath who doesn&#39;t always keep himself in check?  I mean probably, just like Clinton honestly.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think the &#39;locker room talk&#39; is more to say that it was probably exaggerated speak to make himself look more like a &#39;bro&#39; or masculine with other guys around. I think psychologically most &#39;locker room talk&#39; comes from a place of insecurity, and I think Trump&#39;s comments that were recorded were probably very similar. Also, sometimes people are saying things in those settings like a stand-up comedian might... the context is implied that they are joking around and it gets too lewd, but when you record it and present it in different context... All these things.</p>

<p>I can&#39;t say for sure tho - he may be a very dark creepy dude who makes it very hard to actually come after him, so i&#39;m probably best not sticking up for anybody :P</p>

<p>I totally agree, but in terms of the rest of the world, I think Trump&#39;s isolationist policies will (hopefully) lead to less provocations and more peace world-wide. If he takes that military spending back  home, the American people will benefit greatly with both the infrastructure and the work, and now that it&#39;s a Republican president doing it, Congress might actually not shoot themselves in the foot for once and let it happen. For the record, I don&#39;t think all of that is likely to come true, but &#39;business as usual&#39; is definitely what Hilary was selling, and I don&#39;t know how that was working out either. As gross as Trump is, I&#39;m intrigued by the &#39;shake-up&#39; factor; if it is minimal, then we are all worse off with the same shitty system and an even worse administrator of it. However, if he can make some major changes in how the money of government is used, it might be an interesting result. Again, i&#39;m not exactly encouraged, but i&#39;m a hopeless optimist by nature....</p>

<p>He uses fallacious phrases like &quot;A lot people ___ (think/believe/say)&quot; to appeal to the herd mentality. Asks rhetorical questions with the intention to plant ideas:  &quot;Don&#39;t you think _<em>__?&quot; or &quot;wouldn&#39;t it be a shame if _</em>_?&quot;</p>

<p>Then he tops it off by fanning the flames of nationalism. &quot;We are going to make America great again&quot;, &quot;we&#39;ve got to do something about flag burning&quot;, &quot;it&#39;s time for America to start winning again&quot;, &quot;we love our country&quot;.

<p>If you think there&#39;s one smoking gun, post it. But most of the anti Bernie stuff was mild. I think the super delegate support and media time played a bigger role than the DNC. They&#39;re still stupid for running her though.</p>

The Uranium One deal was not Clinton&#39;s to veto or approve</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Among the ways these accusations stray from the facts is in attributing a power of veto or approval to Secretary Clinton that she simply did not have. Clinton was one of nine cabinet members and department heads that sit on the CFIUS, and the secretary of the treasury is its chairperson. CFIUS members are collectively charged with evaluating the transaction for potential national security issues, then turning their findings over to the president. By law, the committee can&#39;t veto a transaction; only the president can. According to The New York Times, Clinton may not have even directly participated in the Uranium One decision. Then-Assistant Secretary of State Jose Fernandez, whose job it was to represent the State Dept. on CFIUS, said Clinton herself &quot;never intervened&quot; in committee matters.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>We can no longer tell what is going on.  A common narrative is now impossible, and its because of the internet.  </p>

<p>So the question is what happens to a society when a common narrative is no longer possible.  Human societies have always had a central narrative.  First religion was destroyed as a central narrative (your opinion may vary on whether that is a good thing or a bad thing), but now even political and economic narratives are no longer possible.   </p>

<p>Central narratives are no longer possible for modern societies.  There are no longer &quot;truths&quot;, even made up ones.  This makes society as a concept entirely break down.  We are all now simply individuals with no guiding narratives.  It&#39;s anomie on a scale that has never been seen before.  </p>

<p>Am I wrong?  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, I already believe that. I also view with suspicion things like Trump&#39;s refusal to put his assets in a blind trust (and reluctance to talk about it, as evidenced by his postponement of the discussion). He doesn&#39;t want to talk about it because he doesn&#39;t want to change it. He wants his kids to be in charge of the family business, and he doesn&#39;t have any qualms about powerful world leaders and business execs being forced to keep in mind that whatever they do to Trump&#39;s business will be discussed with Trump over dinner, and thus affect them. </p>

<p>Remember when Trump cited his son as a computer expert in a speech? I sure remember. In this subreddit I can actually say that and it won&#39;t sound ridiculous. :D</p>

<p><a href="/r/the_donald">/r/the_donald</a> is all super tight with Putin now. But like remember when Republicans gave Obama such a hard time for not being tough enough on Russia. Boom the script is flipped. And with Democrats, trying to frame the election as a Russian hack job. Even though they were just dogging Trump for claiming the election was rigged to begin with(and maybe it was, but for him. Idk?!?). </p>

<p>Everyone is just soooo much about beating the other side. &quot;Liberals are fucking scum&quot;, and &quot;Republicans are racist bigot assholes&quot;</p>

<p>Then the Republicans claim the Democrats are so out of touch and that they&#39;re falling apart. Democrats were saying the same shit in 2008!!! It&#39;s like rinse and repeat while the rest get away with all our cash. </p>

<p>It bums me out that none of them will see it. Everyone is more interested in either jailing that bitch or impeaching Drumpf. Sigh. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>What I was thinking is that many can see that in the email server case Hillary is in the wrong, so branding her as a criminal, in the sense of breaking laws, along with other cases that make people dislike her. Like the Benghazi case where multiple requests of increasing security had been sent, but apparantly never reached her office.</p>

<p>While Trump may be very shady and doing borderline illegal things, as long as he has not done an illegal thing he is not a criminal in the same sense as Hillary. And he being a private company, nobody has set expectations of him working for the people, unlike politicians.</p>

<p>From how I understood the original post it assumed Hillary is a criminal based on the conspiracy theories around her, which include way more shady stuff imo than Trump and her having way more detrimental cases against her than Trump. So in my mind you can&#39;t count on Trump being a criminal, since he hasn&#39;t been close to being convicted as one in court, while one email from Hillarys server has the potential of getting her arrested.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>She was a lawyer initially, which tends to be a pretty lucrative profession. I&#39;d imagine she was also born into some wealth, as her father had successful textile businesses. More recently she&#39;s made money from special interests, you can see it all on opensecrets.com and on her tax returns. She has supposedly profited from the CF, getting tons of money from Russia and Saudi Arabia, something I really wouldn&#39;t doubt. Along with a number of other scandals and shady dealings they&#39;ve done a great job at covering up.</p>

<p>Trump was born into wealth. His father had a successful real-estate business that was subject to multiple investigations regarding profiteering during WWII, and racial scandals. Trump used these connections, and a $50,000,000 loan from his father, to expand this real-estate empire, create a media personality for himself, and to branch into many other businesses (many of which are/were surrounded with scandals and lawsuits). More recently, we don&#39;t know because he refused to release his tax returns, something I personally find very worrying,  because unlike Clinton, we don&#39;t know to where his money has been going or coming. All these scandals, shady dealings, and just plain fucking people over (eg. Stiffing his workers and Trump &quot;University&quot;) is out there for us to see. </p>

<p>They&#39;re both in the 1% and doubtfully have average Americans&#39; interests at heart. The difference is Clinton knows how the country works (and might have done the bare minimum to keep the middle class from totally dying out just to keep the status quo), while Trump only knows how upper management business works. All this &quot;Trump isn&#39;t part of the establishment&quot; is bogus because the establishment is not just a public sector entity, it&#39;s the unholy union of wealthy folks in the public and private sector looking out for each other over the good of average Americans. Trump is not a champion of the working class, he is an establishment elite who&#39;s known nothing but affluence his entire life.</p>

<p>Jesus said, &quot;Do not cast your jewels before swine.&quot; Best things to do is drop tiny gems here and there. An article every once in a while, a simple &#39;Did you know that.....&quot; comment wrapped in humor, a fact wrapped in meme clothing, etc. That&#39;s how you do it and you have to understand a lot of this is too big for most people who simply want to numb themselves from our existence here via: TV, alcohol, Drugs, Cuckbook, Pron, etc.</p>

<p>And that, ladies and genitals, is the biggest conspiracy of them all, the fact that we aren&#39;t even from here. We are Spirits, trapped in a prison shell flesh suit on a prison planet enslaved by debt, currency, propaganda, wage, 40-60 hour work weeks, etc. And you won&#39;t get to go on any retirement until its time for your suit to die anyway.</p>

<p>And this is why there is universal need/want to numb ourselves from this existence, is because its an artificial simulation and not our real home</p>

<p>That&#39;s the thing, if it is, you wouldn&#39;t know it and it would be a preposterous idea to propose, and yet you can&#39;t prove that it&#39;s not. Have you ever been in a dream and you become lucid and realize that it&#39;s not real? What just moments prior, you thought/felt 100% sure was real, now becomes unreal, and yet the brain created everything it needed to fool you. Same deal with waking life.</p>

<p>Its a combo of energy that is living inside of a meat suit...but I&#39;ll tell you what, if you say we only are limited because we believe in these limits, then by all means prove me wrong by substantiating some sort of act to support this theory.

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not saying there&#39;s no correlation between matter and consciousness. But matter is a byproduct of consciousness. Math and science are a way of looking at the universe. Look how much we HAVEN&#39;T progressed in science. Our theorems are on the verge of being proven wrong. Obviously I can&#39;t give you an equation like that, because I know that math and science is a secondary way of looking at the universe. Why specialize in something that isn&#39;t the best aspect of it? Why be a vet tech when you can be a vet? Why be a nurse when you can be a doctor? I could study these equations and attempt to prove them wrong, OR I could not waste my time. Other people will figure out that our equations don&#39;t add up. That isn&#39;t a job I chose to do. I&#39;m not here to say that my opinion is the ultimate truth, because it isn&#39;t. Everyone&#39;s thoughts and opinions create their reality. More and more people are being led to choose science or spirituality. These are connected, but are still opposing poles. Most people are in the middle, but as people choose a side, our collective reality will have to split in some way. War could be this. Depending on your beliefs, an event can put you in one or the other reality.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Whether or not this reality is a simulation is greatly obscured by the fact that we ONLY ever experience the simulation of reality that is produced by our minds. I tend to think that&#39;s where the idea comes from – because yes, there is a very computer-simulation motif going on here, one that&#39;s extremely noticeable on high doses of psychedelic drugs. We <em>are</em> seeing – I believe – a 3D construct filled with procedurally-generated objects (I have witnessed their construction). </p>

<p>The counterpoint to this would be that the simulation isn&#39;t actually inside our biological brains but on some alien computer somewhere, and the brain is just an illusion to lend legitimacy to the idea that the world is as it appears.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know who said it – maybe Alan Watts? – but I really like the notion that we have two heads. We have the head that we feel when we touch it with our hands, but there&#39;s also the other head that is reality as we perceive it, because all that – including what we consider to be our physical head – is actually inside our head, generated by our brain. So you&#39;ve got a head inside a head.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t think these views are incompatible, or even necessarily different. From the perspective of a soul incarnated in a world which it is not of, does it really matter whether this world was created bit by bit in a vast computer, or created within the mind of God? Both of these hypotheses are but crude and wholly insufficient metaphors to grope at a reality that we cannot even begin to grasp with language. And if it is some being(s) who created this as a &quot;simulation&quot; of sorts, would they have put us here with no purpose? I can&#39;t imagine why they would go through the trouble. </p>

There is also no way you could know or prove that our souls came here with purpose, or that we even have souls. Humans have legitimately no clue where they are, who they are, or even what they are. Infinite things are happening inside infinities inside infinities, any reality or all realities or no realities could be simulated or not and it wouldn&#39;t make any difference, because realities are just individual eternities inside individual eternities inside eternal individual eternities, but then again, no they&#39;re not.

    <div class="md"><p>Well said. People who think reality isn&#39;t reality tend to believe the universe is simulated or a dream-like world. This being a simulated reality would conlict with our free will, which you could argue we do not have because simulations don&#39;t have free will. The test then would be to see how far our Will stretches. This is largely undocumented in science because of &quot;unreplicable&quot; results (because the same will/intent is not there). </p>

<p>I don&#39;t mean to come off as arrogant, it&#39;s just that in comparing those two options, simulation seems highly unlikely. A lot of prole propose the simulation but don&#39;t go further than that. Whats the purpose? Who is the creator? Why do anything if you knew you were in a simulation?</p>

<p>That last question leaves a gap in the theory. Unless the purpose of the simulation were to see how we react in the face of that Truth? Simulation seems out of the question, and of course that could just be a reaction to not being able to accept that Truth, but so many people wouldn&#39;t have knowledge and memories of past lives and other dimensions were that not actually the Truth.</p>

<p>I&#39;m really wanting to find holes in either theory. I&#39;d want to know whatever the Truth was</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Why would you assume that a simulation couldn&#39;t have free will? There&#39;s no real theoretical limit to how powerful a computer could be, especially when you take into consideration that we&#39;re already dabbling in things like organic computer technology or quantum computing, as well as decoding our own genome and theorizing electronic data storage on DNA strands. Computers in the future may very well share our very DNA. They could be so powerful that they could not only &#39;sim&#39; a human brain, but millions of them, and could maybe actually &#39;sim&#39; an atom, or an electron, or a quark or an entire universe of atoms and molecules. Suppose it could &#39;sim&#39; the behavior of zillions of subatomic particles; &#39;sim&#39; a totally functional universe comparable to our own in every way right down to the smallest indivisible particles. Math is math, energy is energy. It doesn&#39;t really matter if it&#39;s flowing through a galaxy or a circuit board, I&#39;d struggle to see how energy is any different inside of a simulation than in a &#39;real world&#39;. What is a &#39;real world&#39;, anyway in this context? I mean, in the context of ETERNITY, does a &#39;real world&#39; by default hold more importance or value or meaning or significance than a &#39;simulated world&#39;? Why would that be? If the two worlds are both complex mathematical realities made up of some combination of energy and matter and integers, then I&#39;d have trouble distinguishing what makes one more real than the other at all. I feel like there&#39;s this Matrix misconception that simulation = fake/bad/scary. I think that&#39;s a narrow way to look at it.</p>

All those things you just talked about Facebook, TV, alchohol, etc... Those distractions that try and pull us put of the real world. That&#39;s what religion is for. That&#39;s it&#39;s sole stated purpose. Religion is saying don&#39;t worry if your life sucks now because it&#39;s all just a test and then when you die that&#39;s when you get the good stuff. Religion is saying if you&#39;re oppressed don&#39;t worry about it because you won&#39;t be when you die. You know who benefits from that? The elites. The elite have always been the oppressors, the people with the money get all of the power. However in history the oppressed always eventually rise up in some violent revolution. So how do you fix that? You either do one of two things. You remove the oppressing class. (Which would be true Marxist communism) or you make the oppressed think that they aren&#39;t oppressed or that their oppression is a good thing. That&#39;s what religion does. It presents these true world theories. That this isn&#39;t the real world and you don&#39;t need to worry about suffering while you&#39;re here because after death you get to the &quot;true world&quot;. Don&#39;t buy into that. Don&#39;t suffer on the hope that their is life after death because it doesn&#39;t really matter until after you die so why fucking worry about it? Be the best person you can be and be kind to people and give to charity if you can but do it because you want to help people not because you think God wants you to. And if God is real after you die and he is the correct God not one of the thousand other gods.  I&#39;m sure it&#39;ll go well. Hope this explains why you shouldn&#39;t think that way. </p>

<p>You&#39;re partially correct, in terms of Religion used to control masses, I agree. However, that does not negate that we are Spirits as our true identity.</p>

<p>Also, Religion hasn&#39;t prevent the uprising of violent revolutions which have continued throughout history and still continue today.</p>

<p>Also you can take religions like Buddhism, which aren&#39;t about controlling masses but instead is like a Science of Self investigation and the maps of the inner territory, basically a set of Blueprints to find your true self.</p>

<p>Also, I remember existing before being born in a body, as Pure Spirit, bodiless. There are others like us:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.prebirthmemories.com/prebirth_memories.htm">http://www.prebirthmemories.com/prebirth_memories.htm</a></p>

<p>So in a sense, the partially correct muddled idea that &#39;Religion&#39; is to control the masses, also works to keep people from discovering their own true self and Spiritual strength/power. Its a double edge sword</p>

<p>The high point in our reality is soul cultivation with experiments inside experiment programs within meta-experiments. We are flesh vessels living through that, but it&#39;s an amazing time to be alive, observing change get acceleration in technology and spirituality.</p>

<p>We must remove our mind from this negative realm, but we can still keep pushing a loving, service to others attitude, this includes communicating in this same way with our density superiors.</p>

<p>It depends.....you can love your prison or hate it. Many of the Mystery schools, Buddhism, Bon, Dzogchen, etc of antiquity which have as their main premise that of Spiritual Enlightenment, eventually gain the ability to OBE at will, and what do they find on the other side?</p>

<p>That we are imprisoned within a cycle of reincarnation over and over and over again and the only way out is to attain Enlightenment. </p>

<p>So technically speaking, you can justify this earthly existence in as many ways as there are people and religions......but what I want to know is what&#39;s true, not what justification will work for me. Because if its undoubtedly true that we are imprisoned in reincarnation, then for all of us here, the number 1 priority should be to escape it</p>

<p>I&#39;m still all for love, change, service, helping, upliftment, etc....but I still think, feel, am leaning towards the reincarnation prison</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The glaring fallacy here is thinking that Russia has our (America&#39;s) best interest at heart. That a leader who spent his entire career as a KGB official with the US as the counterweight / bad guys now just wants to be friends. That global politics is not a zero-sum power game and that for Russia to further their power on the global level, the US must be weakened and withdraw. </p>

<p>This is not a situation of &quot;informed Americans siding with Russia&quot;. It&#39;s a situation of Americans facing extreme cognitive dissonance, and now choosing to believe Putin is suddenly a <em>benevolent force with America&#39;s interest at heart</em> rather than accepting that US public opinion was manipulated by a foreign power to elect an isolationist and comparatively unqualified candidate that will weaken the US on a global stage and open space for Russia&#39;s global power to grow. </p>

<p>Russia&#39;s loyalty is only to Russia, and Putin&#39;s loyalty is only to himself and his country. That&#39;s it.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t have kids, and honestly I&#39;m not sure if I want to given what I see coming, but to some extent, shielding them will make it harder for them to navigate the world they will be handed at adulthood. I know you want them to have a happy childhood, and I&#39;m not suggesting you inundate them with all the worst you&#39;ve learned of this world, but if you want them to be able to turn some of it around when they&#39;re old enough, now is the time to teach them the critical thinking skills which they will certainly not learn in common core schools. </p>

<p>Well, yeah. Because it&#39;s not realistic. I mean are you going to <em>shoot your wife</em>?

<p>I&#39;m certain we&#39;re 100% on opposite sides of nearly every major issue facing the body politic right now. But I have a hard time believing you&#39;re prepared to camp out in the cold and shit in a cathole just for the chance to shoot me in the face. I&#39;m sure as hell not gonna. I have a hard time believing you&#39;d start by firing on your wife or that she&#39;d start by firing on you. I mean your marriage is <em>living proof</em> that no civil war is coming, because if you and her were prepared to finally resolve these disputes with force you&#39;d start with each other.</p>

<p>But you haven&#39;t. And won&#39;t. It&#39;s not <em>necessary.</em></p>

<p>And yours from Reddit (or Breitbart)? How do you think that makes her feel? I agree with you - it&#39;s <em>really concerning</em> how it seems like there&#39;s two camps of people who fundamentally can&#39;t seem to articulate <em>any</em> shared truth about the world around us. But the reason that&#39;s not going to lead to <em>actual civil war</em> is because of your marriage. I mean, not <em>only</em> your marriage, but what it represents - you and I don&#39;t recognize almost any shared feature of reality, but somehow we both still recognize a society that has us both in it. As bad as some of the eliminationist rhetoric got during the election, I never heard Trump say anything like &quot;you know, we&#39;d really all be better off without all these Democrats.&quot;</p>

<p>And where do you get your news? Drudge? Infowars? Breitbart? Consider that that&#39;s just as scary to other people as her getting her news from Facebook is to you. If you get your news from sites of that ilk, you have to consider that there is a political spin there that you don&#39;t see because it reinforces your worldview and confirmation bias. You look as insane to other people as your wife looks to you. I mean, I feel like it&#39;s a madhouse when known conservative shills like Sean Hannity are sidling up to Julian Assange like they <em>didn&#39;t</em> think Chelsea Manning was a traitor and trying to embrace a narrative that leaks are patriotic, when they&#39;ve argued just the opposite for years.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think most people know deep down but don&#39;t want to acknowledge it. I had a friend I used to try to explain things too and he would vehemently deny it no matter how much proof was given. He finally told me one day he knew I was right he just didn&#39;t like thinking about that stuff and would rather be ignorant to it. I think that&#39;s how most people feel</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I just had one of these conversations with a buddy of mine yesterday.  He completely believes that everything on TV is reality.  Hillary was proven innocent.  There is no pedophilia going on in Washington.  There is no way they could cover all this stuff up.  Snopes is right 100&amp;% of the time.  I could go berserk.  But, one thing I have learned when trying to talk to people about these topics now, is to just ask the important questions to get them thinking, and then they don&#39;t feel so threatened.  They feel that they are in control of thinking about it. Then the seed will grow and they will hear about it elsewhere and hopefully they will start researching it and start falling into some rabbit holes.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hey man I was feeling the same way until I talked to a younger guy yesterday which restored a little faith in humanity for me. This guy is 19 and i assumed he was just like all the other kids of our generation because of the way he carried himself and because he sells weed/party/be the class clown at work etc. But he told me he likes to read books which caught me off guard since I don&#39;t know anybody who still reads a book. Anyways, he starts talking to me about how his friend at a local grocery shop recommended it from their book section and when he described what it was about, it sounded similar to The Finders cult group/PizzaGate and i asked him was this book based on true events and he said yeah. Then I said how that sounds like this group called The Finders and how they were a pedophile cult, to which he got excited and said that THAT was the name of the book but he couldn&#39;t remember the whole name but that THAT is what was going on in the book.</p>

<p>I was fucking surprised. This kid has stumbled upon the rabbit hole without even knowing and I&#39;d like to think that whoever his friend was at that store who recommended the book, he was just nudging him towards it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;d be surprised. A silent majority of us Gen Y kids are woke af. We feel the sense of impending dread in this world because we&#39;ve been connected to it for our whole lives short as they may be. And it would be us who is left to pick up the pieces. A lot dabble in plain illuminutty conspiracy theories but only because we see how fucked up the world is. We &quot;party&quot; because we don&#39;t really know what our future is in store for us, and all things considered how could we ever know? It&#39;s obvious so many were brainwashed to never think about something past surface level. And that&#39;s why we don&#39;t share how we feel about this unless we know you&#39;ve seen it too. Because this used to be the type of shit that gets you sent to the psych ward if you weren&#39;t careful. 
Kind of like an old time alchemist I know of didn&#39;t trust anyone who didn&#39;t smoke cigarettes too. It seems to be the culture. Some embrace it better than others. Others are doomed to never see it coming. Such is life</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve noticed this in your younger generation (i&#39;m right between GenX and Millennials myself)... Very aware compared to previous generations, and the &#39;lazy unmotivated&#39; trope is only there because so many of you refused to play &#39;the game&#39; that the older generations prize so much.</p>

<p>As far as sharing information, for me personally I have come to the realization that you don&#39;t get anywhere with people by giving them answers to questions they aren&#39;t asking. I try to be hyper-aware of anybody who wants to engage on these subjects and explore the mystery along with them if they&#39;re open to it, but if somebody is not asking &#39;why?&#39; then these ideas and realizations are not important to them. On top of that, they are generally kinda uncomfortable things to think about as well if you don&#39;t see the bigger picture of it all or don&#39;t have hope that we can pull ourselves through it.</p>

<p>I think there will be events in the future where those people will starting asking &#39;Why?&#39; more than they do now, and I think it is going to be our role to help them understand some of these things and deal with the aftermath. I think people will be very surprised with how much compassion the younger generations have for the world. I believe they are just less particular with whom they show that compassion for. The world is connected like never before.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m right there with you. Didn&#39;t really hit me until I read your comment. It definitely feels like I&#39;m on another planet. My whole family are Hillary supporters (probably Bernie for most but switched when he didn&#39;t get the nomination. That&#39;s a whole other thing). I didn&#39;t support her or trump. And when I talk about anything regarding emails or criminal activity I&#39;m met with fierce resistance or flat out denial from everyone but my sister (probably most level headed). I even fee the same way with my wife who is a trump supporter.</p>

<p>We&#39;re definitely being fed an alternate reality and it&#39;s infuriating seeing that people are denying it believing everything the media is throwing at them. It doesn&#39;t take much to do a bit of research or be critical of what you see and hear.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I know a couple people that went Stein after supporting Bernie. Otherwise they stayed with the party. But why...the one I saw most outspoken about it is anti-third party. If Bernie represented real change and anti-establishment type politics why move support to someone that keeps the status-quo and is the establishment? Makes no sense. I never supported Bernie because my views/beliefs are pretty much the exact opposite of his but I did admire his honesty and integrity, something you don&#39;t see a lot in politics now. I was sad to see how he was being treated and the emails and everything else just put the final nail in the coffin regarding any possible support for Hillary I had (it was about the millionth nail).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The majority of the population <em>doesn&#39;t know.</em> You&#39;re all being fed lies and not thinking about it for yourself. WTC 7 could not have physically fell in the way it did according to the story we were given. An unhindered freefall occurs, as it did on all three towers, under the conditions of a controlled demolition. That alone is evidence of inconsistencies. I could go on. The fact that &quot;fake news&quot; is an issue to the Democratic party is frightening. They are labeling anything against their agenda as false. </p>

<p>Back to the point. No one is right, no one is wrong. That&#39;s your first mistake. There are only facts. If you look at the facts and stop blindly trusting the opinion of the supposed majority, you&#39;d see the inconsistencies. Also, I don&#39;t think the &quot;majority&quot; really give a fuck. And that&#39;s the problem. They are OK with a proven corrupt DNC, but instantly point the finger at Russia without any evidence, while <em>ignoring</em> evidence suggesting, not proving, that Seth Rich among other DNC insiders were responsible for leaking information. It&#39;s time to stop blindly agreeing with public opinion. The war in Syria is going to be won by Assad. I don&#39;t think anyone is happy about it, but the fact that the US has been supplying weapons to Islamic militants to overthrow a democratically elected government is a sign that the Democratic Party does not have the intentions of the people in mind, but have a larger agenda. I know you&#39;re probably just CTR by your argument strategy, but I hope you consider some things that may scare you. It&#39;s not okay that these things are happening. We are the only opposition of the mainstream bullshit. And we&#39;re growing. Be a part of the change, be accepting of new ideas. Don&#39;t silence others or shut out opinions just because they make you feel bad.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I admit that I used to be one of those people. When you boil it down, the more the person trusts the MSM to give them accurate information, the more hostile they are to the actual truth. </p>

<p>I was a big time BernieBro, and the first clue I got that the media might be a bit more biased than I thought was when he called out Hillary for skimming off the Hillary Victory Fund (she took nearly <em>everything</em>) and rather than investigate, they all piled on him and ran a week&#39;s worth of hit pieces. Until it was shown he was absolutely right. </p>

<p>Then the DNC leaks popped up, and they showed just how rigged the process had been against Bernie. Did the MSM cover that? Nope, not with the veracity that it should have, because they were all in bed with Hillary (which the Podesta emails eventually showed).</p>

<p>This got me thinking, if their coverage of Bernie could be so terrible and biased, and they&#39;re the <em>liberal</em> media, what was their coverage of Trump like? (at the time I still hated him, because I trusted the media). What I found took my breath away. This guy has been so maligned by the media it&#39;s borderline criminal, or possibly should be. I think everybody has been referring to this moment as being &quot;red-pilled,&quot; and it hit me like a fucking freight train. Sure, Trump has his gaffes, and the media certainly has a right to report on them, but then they make up lies based off of them. That&#39;s the troubling part.</p>

<p>And now the media is trying to help Hillary steal the election since she couldn&#39;t win it legitimately, by reporting the &quot;Russian hacking&quot; lies as truth, as Julian Assange <a href="https://youtu.be/zsZjXijcPbU">will attest</a> (everybody should listen to that).</p>

<p>Once you see the propaganda in the media, there&#39;s no going back. The amount of lies being passed off as truth is staggering. I&#39;ve always been a critical thinker, so conspiracies don&#39;t usually last long in my head, but I truly feel like I&#39;m in bizarro-world right now.</p>

<p>Your OP is about how you take a decision to view reality from a distorted angle, and then you conclude that lots of things &#39;make sense&#39;. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, she actually is <strong>not</strong> a criminal.</p>

<p>A criminal, by definition, is someone who has been convicted of a crime. Hillary Clinton has not been convicted of anything.</p>

<p>I presume that you believe she has committed criminal offences, and that&#39;s where the problem starts. In order to confirm your belief, you have viewed the evidence in the light of your conclusion, and naturally your prejudice is confirmed. </p>

<p>It&#39;s not often that you nincompoops will admit that this is what you do, but you are red-handed - you did that in your OP.</p>

<p>The problem for you is that this is called rationalisation, and it is the exact opposite of logical argument.</p>

<p>What you <em>should</em> do is consider the evidence, including evidence that points in other directions, allot an appropriate weight to all the evidence you have, and then see if the preponderance of evidnece compels a conclusion, or if not, makes a conclusion more likely than not.</p>

<p>Not that you are going to do any of that, because it would involve admitting that you&#39;ve been a gullible nitwit up to now.</p>

<p>Once they convince you that you can&#39;t trust what you see around you - that the evidence of your own eyes and your own experience is actually constructed by those who mean you harm - then they can basically sell you anything they want, because any contradictory evidence is &quot;constructed reality&quot; and any skepticism is &quot;being a sheep.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>As much as I am annoyed by the overused &#39;red pill&#39; term and others like it, there is something to it. Most people are drones. They don&#39;t know any better, and they are perfectly happily going about their lives in blissful ignorance of all the insanity going on around them. They merrily cling to the happy lies that are fed to them every day. It&#39;s frustrating to witness but the reasoning for it is perfectly understandable. Most people just don&#39;t care enough to investigate things. They deal with what is in their immediate vicinity and don&#39;t worry about the rest. It could be considered a form of base pragmatism I suppose.</p>

I was so outraged beyond reason I latched onto anything that gave me hope for small business at all.  So I took Hillary as &quot;the next best thing&quot; and started to bellow against Trump supporters.  But the fight was all staged.  Hillary was laying smoke screen over smoke screen and the only thing I&#39;m mad at now is myself for getting distracted by it all.

<p>Well it must be nice to have enough free time to come here and mock all of the people being slaughtered in Syria as just paranoid delusions that don&#39;t really exist. Just lump it altogether into one pot, put it on the same level as lizard people which are rarely ever actually discussed here.</p>

<p>You worthless sociopaths are all the same.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hillary Clinton isn&#39;t an everyday person like you. Her days are filled learning how best to present herself, and sell herself. She carefully molds her positions and agenda (and I don&#39;t necessarily mean agenda in a negative way. We all have an agenda) in order to advance her and those she wants supporting her.</p>

<p>Perhaps not unlike a professional actor, I imagine she practices speeches, and how she is going to appear in front of crowds. Down to microscopic details, her day is planned, and precisely coordinated.</p>

<p>Can you remember what it was like to be you a week ago? Hillary Clinton can&#39;t remember what it is like to be an &quot;everyday American&quot; because eternities have come and gone for her, a blur of half baked memories of political races, opponents, scandals in which she carefully puts her emotions and public reactions in the backseat.</p>

<p>Psychologically, she is almost unrecognizable to the 9-5ers. She has not worried about money or comfort or health care most likely her whole life. She eats what is catered or brought to her. She compliments and plays the social engineering game exceptionally well. She is politically correct, respectful when needed, and I do believe she has a temper she is quite good at managing.</p>

<p>But that is the reality I imagine* for Hillary. Maybe you are right, and she is just a good person caught in extraordinarily inauthentic ways of living, and trying to think of all the unrelateable people her decisions and actions impact. I think she discarded useless feelings like compassion and empathy a long time ago in favor of public approval.</p>

<p>When I told her that, I could tell something clicked, but she is certainly one of those people who chooses to ignore the things of which we at R/conspiracy discuss, because it would make her outlook&quot; too negative and too difficult to live with&quot;- which I view the opposite.

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s been pretty obvious that CTR is still active. Vote manipulation is more of a problem now than ever. They have bots that recognizably downvote key words. CTR has an argument strategy that is to deflect attention and trigger conflict. Any rational person, strictly given facts, would not have any reason to believe or argue that Russian intelligence and <em>putin himself</em> carried out the dnc leaks. But that seems to be the narrative they&#39;re pushing. Defecting attention from the unaddressed corruption, instead assigning blame to an outside influence and exploiting the public&#39;s emotion. It&#39;s pretty clear what their plan is. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t like to be partisan, but trump has covered his tracks well enough that no one knows his secrets. The Clintons, especially Hillary, however, have a record of carelessness. They have been caught many times, but weaseled out because they had friends. Podesta fell for a phishing scheme. Any 15 year old could have gotten access to his emails. Hillary used an unsecured server and it was a matter of time before someone got into it. If anyone is to blame, it should be them for being that careless. The US has intervened in hundreds of &quot;elections&quot; and if it did turn out that there was evidence that the leak was Russian, I don&#39;t think it should be given much attention because in the end, they only exposed the truth that he dnc is corrupt. The people at fault are the ones who <em>let it happen</em>. </p>

<p>Trump is an establishment billionaire that has been in a position of power his entire life yet he&#39;s never brought up in any of the pizzagate conspiracies. There is far more direct proof of his pedophile tendencies than misquoted excerpts about cheese pizza but somehow none of it matters. To the point where he has said disgusting things about his own daughter when she was a baby and where different underage girls have directly claimed that he would ogle them. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Love your thinking. Only problem is, it works both ways. The AGW people started off thinking AGW was real. They built computer models to prove that. The models got further and further away from actual reality. So they fudged the date to agree with the models. Remember the &quot;Hide the data&quot; scandal? Oh you forgot. </p>

<p>Hillary started out with Trump loves Putin. Then morphed that to &quot;Trump is a Putin Puppet&quot;. From there she went to Putin is Helping Trump. Then it was Putin is hacking to help Trump. To Putin influenced the election. And now we know it was a huge hoax of fake news. </p>

<p>The reality is, Hillary is a criminal. She realizes Trump might very well make appointments that would come after her and she could end up in jail. Stripped of her wealth. Powerless and alone. Her husband in jail and at very least her daughter paying serious fines and reputation ruined. All her cronies who committed crime could also end up in deep trouble. And the Clinton murders could become exposed. The blow back could ruin things for Obama as well. </p>

<p>So, yes, at this point, they will do anything to save their necks. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>So all the evidence that is so easy to find if you just google it means nothing to you? Hillary directly supported inciting riots and violence at Trump rallies. Bob Creamer is on tape boasting that he gets his marching orders directly from the Hillary campaign. Just what the hell would you consider proof? After Vince Foster committed suicide Hillary rushed to his residence and took loads of documents. Right after. Before there was an investigation. They later found those documents at Hillary&#39;s residence with her fingerprints. All over them. Ron Brown supposedly died in a plane crash. Special ops were spotted leaving the area right after the crash. Ron Brown was found with a contact bullet wound .45 on the top of his skull. I saw the bit map when it used to be online right after the incident. You could see lead fragments around the hole. You could see the contact imprint of a Desert Eagle .45. The investigation claimed that it was a wound that was incurred during the plane crash. The man who did the original autopsy was killed a day after the work was done. The air traffic controller was killed two days after the crash. Ron Brown&#39;s attorney was killed three days later. You just can&#39;t make this shit up. </p>

<p>Wasn&#39;t she only accused of wanting to use some stupid costumes during a Trump rally? None of which violated any laws. Hardly riots or violence. </p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Whitewater? Clinton didn&#39;t personally go and steal documents out of Fosters residence. White House counsel was present when the FBI searched the house and documents were given to them and then on to Clintons lawyers and then to Justice Department investigators. FBI concluded there was no way of knowing when Clintons fingerprints could have gotten onto the documents(possibly 1992 when it was in the news as she testified). </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Ron Brown supposedly died in a plane crash. Special ops were spotted leaving the area right after the crash.</p>

<p>There&#39;s a Mayday episode about this, I don&#39;t remember anything about &quot;special ops&quot; in it. I&#39;d love to see some sources for that. </p>

<p>Personally I think I&#39;m going to trust the investigators and multiple military pathologists over your recollection of an image you saw online.</p>

<p><a href="http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1998-01-11/news/9801110008_1_x-rays-steven-cogswell-commerce-secretary-ron-brown">http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1998-01-11/news/9801110008_1_x-rays-steven-cogswell-commerce-secretary-ron-brown</a> and <a href="http://articles.latimes.com/1997/dec/25/news/mn-2268">http://articles.latimes.com/1997/dec/25/news/mn-2268</a> good articles that go into some of the things you mentioned including the supposed bullet wound. But honestly why would commandos shoot his corpse? Or how would they shoot him in front of dozens of passengers and then escape an aircraft before it crashes? It doesn&#39;t add up. </p>

<p>Also about Barbara Wise:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>There was no pool of blood, and Barbara Wise&#39;s death was never ruled a suicide by anyone. She was discovered in her Commerce Department office on 29 November 1996 after having last been seen alive on 27 November 1996, the day before Thanksgiving. A thorough investigation uncovered no evidence of foul play or suicide. Wise had a history of frequent and severe health problems, including liver ailments, and her death was attributed to natural causes.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>snopes via <a href="http://articles.baltimoresun.com/1996-12-01/news/1996336009_1_wise-foul-play-washington-police">http://articles.baltimoresun.com/1996-12-01/news/1996336009_1_wise-foul-play-washington-police</a></p>

<p>Again it&#39;s all a bunch of speculation with very little damning evidence, especially compared to the claims attributed against her. </p>

<p>Very true but context is everything!</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The photo I saw actually came from the investigation. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes, correct but there was an explanation for that if you read the linked news article. </p>

<p>From the Tribune: </p>

<blockquote>
<p>True, Cogswell admits he did not examine Brown&#39;s body. He only saw the X-rays and photos of Brown and other documents in the institute&#39;s files. Still, his observation that the injury &quot;appeared&quot; to be a bullet wound was supported by Lt. Col. David Hause, who said he saw Brown&#39;s corpse. </p>

<p>Meanwhile, military pathologists found another explanation for the &quot;bullet-fragment&quot; images. They found identical patterns of particles on other X-rays, not just Brown&#39;s, that were taken with the same X-ray cassette. They blamed the particles on a faulty X-ray cassette.</p>

<p>Col. William T. Gormley, the Air Force pathologist who did examine Brown&#39;s body, ordered additional X-rays after finding the head injury. As for the hole that looks like a gunshot wound, closer examination revealed no bullet, no bone fragments, no metal fragments and, even more telling, no exit wound.</p>

<p>Right, you believe snopes. We&#39;re done. Obviously it&#39;s a useless conversation.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But the information is from the Baltimore Sun and DCPD, not from Snopes. :\ </p>

<p>AGW --- Most of the people who say that they &quot;fudged&quot; the data are not correct. I haven&#39;t seen much data fudging. 99% of that data showing evidence of human impact of climate change is not corrupted. </p>

<p>Next, the trump and Putin thing... why did you bring that up? super random. Second... that is some of the only news that is not fake... did Russia actually change votes? No, there is no evidence of that.... But did they try to influence public opinion? yes they definitely did. You can see it on their propaganda TV channel in Russia. Also the CIA and FBI has backed this up.  </p>

<p>Finally... I don&#39;t see Hillary as a criminal. I don&#39;t understand what her daughter did that would require fines. Why would husband be in jail? What are you even talking about??The private server was not illegal at the time she set it up... using it when she started office was not illegal either. All the emails she sent were emails that she SHOULD HAVE SENT! There are no murder emails from pizzagate. lol</p>

<p>While as citizens there&#39;s not a lot we can do if the govt make more war again, we will not be manipulated into fighting each other.
While I do see the potential for some conflicts to arise, most people will not participate. Some of it is complacency, it&#39;s hard to watch GoT while shooting and looting your local grocery store. </p>

<p>More than that, is love. It&#39;s easy to hate people when they&#39;re abstract concepts, or dickhead drivers, funny looking.Its a lot harder to look another human in the eyes and not understand that so much more is the same than different. There are no clear lines to be fought over, no uniforms.

<p>I feel some might want a race war, but fuck them, they&#39;re fucking stupid.( including extremists on both sides there, while I agree with some of the BLM points, there are def racists in that movement as well) </p>

<p>Edit. you don&#39;t have to be an agent to stir dissent. Things ARE crazy. There are agenda at play, on many sides. Some people have no idea , they&#39;re just doing what their view says fits and is right.

<p>A Local news commenter praised his civil disobedience, calls him a hero, etc. do any of you think that was heroic? I dismiss as a troll, but who knows anymore, some people are so hate filled. Then of course, on the flip side, some one called for their arrest over said statements, which is almost as bad, and would be as bad, if they had authority to do so. </p>

<p>If more than half of the people do praise killers, ( NOT ADMINISTRATIVE/military level, that&#39;s another issue entirely) then maybe I&#39;m wrong, and the reality disconnect is so strong that a bunch of Christians would murder each other in their homeland, commiting terrorist acts against their brethren, in the name of &quot;freedom&quot; </p>

<p>Its never going to come to fighting. Which is a good thing. But never underestimate the &quot;other side&quot;. There are many responsible gun-owning liberals. And I personally know conservatives who don&#39;t want guns. Liberals and conservatives are not as different as the news makes it seem. We&#39;re all human beings and we all want what is best for ourselves and for our loved ones. And the opposite of that would be &quot;war&quot;. If there are people out there who <em>do</em> want civil war, I never want to meet them. I don&#39;t want them anywhere near America, let alone living inside the borders. We are waaaaay past that point in American history. Let&#39;s keep it that way.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Actually, it makes more sense when you realize that she was a fantastic candidate for president: brilliant, extremely hard-working, admired by everyone who worked with her (including republicans), with hundreds of coveted endorsements from around the world and in the U.S., with detailed policies and how to implement them posted... if she got elected into the White House with Bill at her side, she would have been one of the truly great presidents.</p>

<p>It took a cascade of dirty tricks, slander, and unsavory actors and their corrupt schemes in order to make a monster and loser out of her.  And that&#39;s what the Trumpsters and the GOP came up with, with a lot of help from the Democratic-party-bashing progressives (e.g. Sanders &amp; Nader) who love to spoil elections whenever their pick loses the primary.  You can literally trace the escalation of misconduct and dumpster fires thrown at her as the general election progressed.</p>

The establishment wanted the establishment candidate over the guy who opportunistically joined the party to use as a political platform, big surprise. She had the connections, and those connections worked for her, and it&#39;s not the idealized beautiful version of democracy one might hope for but it&#39;s the political reality one has to adapt to. Clinton adapted, and it gave her a 3mil vote win. Argue for changes to the policial process, that&#39;s great! There&#39;s definitely room for improvment.

<p>And you don&#39;t understand how polls work. Some poll aggregators had shitty methodology, inferring a conspiracy from that is what you&#39;d expect from a forum like this but nonetheless redundant and stupid. 538 was pretty accurate though. They gave him like a 30% chance of winning and said from the start that &quot;fundamentals&quot; predicted a close race. They also predicted Clinton pop vote win with Trump EC win as a very possible scenario well before the election.</p>

<p>There&#39;s no massive conspiracy encompassing hundreds of different pollsters to promote an agenda. If the democrats had that sort of power you&#39;d have a democratic president coming up. The polls were within standard MoE, statistical deviations is a much simpler and more believeable explanation than your armchair conclusions about the evil media.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Lmao this post gave me cancer. If you need someone to explain all the ways Hillary is corrupt then you don&#39;t belong on this subreddit. Go back to your echo chambers in r/politics, buddy. Hillary would have done anything to win the election, even if it meant tearing her party apart to become president. </p>

<p>Bernie should have won the nomination. If Hillary would have thought for the better good and not her own selfish aspirations we wouldn&#39;t have Donald as a president. It&#39;s funny how now she&#39;s complaining about voting fraud when it clearly wasn&#39;t an issue to her when it helped her beat Bernie. Seriously, did you just plug your ears this entire election cycle and ignore all the corruption she shamelessly displayed? </p>

<p>She used every damn dirty trick in the book trying to win this election <em>and she still lost</em>. <strong>Thats how unelectable she was and how much the American public hated her.</strong> she couldn&#39;t even win against Donald trump for Christ sakes. The man grabbing people by the pussy. How terrible of a candidate do you have to be to lose to someone like that? </p>

<p>The American public won&#39;t be fooled by people like you who think saying a couple nice things about a corrupt individual will change how people view her. </p>

<p>she was a fantastic candidate for president: brilliant, extremely hard-working, admired by everyone who worked with her (including republicans), with hundreds of coveted endorsements from around the world and in the U.S., with detailed policies and how to implement them posted... if she got elected into the White House with Bill at her side, she would have been one of the truly great presidents.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, she lost because she did not put in the work. She spoke to the public for maybe 15 minutes a week. She disappeared for days at a time. Mostly, she just went to fundraisers with the ultra rich and famous. She didn&#39;t bother visiting Wisconsin for 7 months before the election. She called a quarter of the voters deplorables. Trump was speaking to the public for over 2 hours a day for 18 months. He had hour long policy speeches on each of his positions. Hillary never talked policy once. In order to get a crowd, she had to employ Jay Z, Beyonce and Michelle Obama. It was the white voters in Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin who voted for Obama last time around that went to Trump. It has nothing to do with race or sex. It has to do with feeling included. She was the establishment candidate picked by the 1%. America did not want that. </p>

<p>This GIF sums up why she lost.</p>

We hear &quot;Well she was under investigation by the FBI for nearly her entire election&quot;. Which means it worked.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yep, she was found guilty of not following the security protocol. Which is not a crime. Which is why I (and the person you originally responded to) argue that people who call her a criminal are fueled by partisanship rather than any objective analysis. Which you felt the need to object to. </p>

<p>Look I can understand where you&#39;re coming from, but just don&#39;t make this one mistake: Don&#39;t use wealth of investigations as implication of guilt.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Calling someone a racist is fairly subjective though. Criminality is not. I don&#39;t call someone out when they call Clinton crooked, or evil, or &#39;bought by wall street&#39;, because while i may disagree at times those things are open for interpretation. Criminality is defined by the law, and the highest agencies of criminal justice in the US have said that it doesn&#39;t apply.</p>

<p>Find me one time where she talked about her potential policies for more than 5 minutes. You will be hard pressed to find it. Meanwhile, I can find an hour long speech on on ten separate issues. </p>

<p>I listened to Hillary everytime she spoke because I do believe that knowing both sides is important and I also need the cannon fodder to use fighting with her supporters. It wasn&#39;t hard, she would give me week long breaks between speeches. I voted Kerry, Obama, Obama, Trump btw. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I could equivalently just reduce any of Trump&#39;s policy speeches to him standing around saying &quot;We will make america great again and bring back manufacturing jobs, <em>believe me</em>.&quot; Plus you posted that 6 minutes after I linked a 40+min video, so you could not possibly have watched it.

    <div class="md"><p>If Hillary is dirty enough to rig the DNC, why not the whole damn thing?</p>

<p>Besides, it really doesn&#39;t matter who is in the hot seat, as long as we&#39;re playing red vs. blue, we lose.  The truth is, both sides are playing for their own benefit, which in many cases means they&#39;re working together behind closed doors.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t have proof, just a gut feeling.  We pretend those gut feelings aren&#39;t real, but they&#39;re sometimes more real than anything a news outlet can tell us.  After all, they are the ones who get to decide what news is &quot;real news&quot; and what news is &quot;fake news.&quot;</p>

<p>This whole thing, no matter who is the president, is going to have us with less and the elites with more.  Freedom, money, land, whatever.</p>

<p>We&#39;re fucked, and people who pretend Trump cares about them are sadly mistaken.  None of them care about any of us except for where our slave labor is useful to them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The next month won&#39;t be a very dangerous time for us... You don&#39;t want the populace to be in fear... they should stay aware, but not afraid. All the worst parts of the WWIII script have been avoided... NSA knows all... and leaked to all the right people in all the right ways... they don&#39;t want war on American soil and everyone on the level has coordinated to block everything in the playbook. </p>

<p>There was a lot of dirty tricks planned because HRC doesn&#39;t play by the rules... she was compromised for years... people were watching her every move... and she was planning some horrific stuff. But she got put into custody on election night... along with her whole posse... only allowed out for special highly controlled events. Shes gone dark to her international backers that paid for a US/Russian war to go down... cause both nations were getting a little too &quot;uncorrupt&quot; to be safe. </p>

<p>Comey&#39;s FBI &amp; Friends cockblocked every single terrorist act on American soil from a day or two before the election... WWIII was already supposed to be mounting right now... WJC and HRC out of the picture keeps the US safe... cause all the &quot;terrorists&quot; on the payroll are broke and see what just happened... so they are too scared to act when there is no one to protect them. </p>

<p>Soros has a lot of money tied up in destabilizing America right now, but for as much as a total fuckhead that he is... he plays by rules... not like HRC... he won&#39;t break laws. Manipulating humanity is like a game of chess to him... he won&#39;t cheat because it is all about prestige and honor and self satisfaction. He won&#39;t be a poor loser like HRC. He will keep the organizations he has funded already going... since he has no morals. But he won&#39;t get too crazy... he never does. </p>

<p>We&#39;re in the clear... don&#39;t be scared... but stay vigilant... we&#39;re not out of the woods yet, but the worst is behind us. The White Hats out there in the world have control of the ship now... seas are still a bit choppy but the perfect storm is over. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>When all you have is a hammer, everything looks like a nail.</p>

<p>Now ask yourself who benefits from having hardline militarists, and corporatists in the executive wing. It sure as hell isn&#39;t likely to be the guy on the street wondering when that pothole is getting fixed, or when their local school will be getting new books, and that&#39;s really the problem over the last 50 years.</p>

<p>Corporatists have largely stopped any investment in the United States proper, hospitals, schools, libraries, sewer systems, roads, electrical grids, all date from the 1950&#39;s or 1960&#39;s, when the corporate elite figured there were greener pastures overseas and figured the United States wasn&#39;t worth investing in.</p>

<p>Germany, France and other countries can have social support systems, but fuck it, the US and her people DEFINITELY don&#39;t deserve that. So we don&#39;t have it. Taxes in real terms are negative for most corporations of appreciable size. Exxon,Walmart, Comcast, and all manner of other large firms receive subsidies for any investment they make domestically. </p>

<p>Manufacturing, for it&#39;s part, has undergone the same sort of automation that farming underwent 100 years ago. So in the near term instead of 30 or 40% of &quot;real&quot; jobs being in Manufacturing everyone should expect that number to be 4-5% because that&#39;s EXACTLY what happened in Agriculture. </p>

<p>So how exactly do you employ 30% of the US population, a problem to be sure.</p>

<p>Of course we&#39;re long since sold on the idea the social support systems, welfare, re-education, etc, are socialism and bad, as opposed to the cost of living in a civilization that&#39;s advanced and subject to radical shifts as technology improves. </p>

<p>So when fusion reactors come online (as the fusion demonstrator in Germany says can happen), who employs the coal-miner, or the pipe-line guys when you can pull your energy supply straight from the air, or from seawater.  </p>

<p>Of course being a bunch of militarists is money in the bank if you mean to kick up another war in Iraq or Iran or where-ever.</p>

<p>The fact that China and Iran and Russia have a military alliance - is not mentioned in polite GOP circles because it&#39;s a non-starter in terms of a war. It&#39;s BAD.</p>

<p>So we start dicking around with Iran, because we&#39;re strong, right, sounds right, they want nukes, and our Israeli allies would rather they don&#39;t.</p>

<p>Too fucking bad, all China has to do, to - impress upon the American people is any one of a dozen things, from suddenly running out of DIMM chip memory, to calling our debt (roughly 3-4 trillion dollars) or impose a tariff on any number of our commodities, or worse, pick an industry and swamp this or that marketplace with cheap knockoffs. Economic warfare is no joke. </p>

<p>So blowhard politics are not appropriate, I may not like it, but this isn&#39;t checkers , it&#39;s that wonderful 4d chess everyone keeps harping on about. </p>

<p>And we&#39;re gunning up to play the most kick-ass checkers game, ever it&#39;s gonna be huge.</p>

<p>Even just forgetting conspiracy theory stuff, just look at issues that are settled fact, public record. Bill fucking around with his damn intern in the Oval Office. Hillary lying about the Youtube video in Benghazi (yes, it is a confirmed lie). The way they just took millions and millions from foreign governments through the CF. The fucking email server which should not have existed in the first place.</p>

<p>It is not merely that they did these things with total disregard for consequences, but that they consistently lie about everything they do, even after they&#39;ve been caught, and instead pressure their surrogates to go into full spin mode to do damage control.</p>

<p>This whole Russia thing is the absolute apex of their manipulative bullshit and is doing INCREDIBLE damage not only to this country, but to Obama too! Because Hillary fucked this election up so badly Obama is flushing his legacy down the toilet by tainting the last days of his presidency with this new Red Scare bullshit.

<p>Otherwise you have to believe that despite being the most incompetent criminal conspirators of all time - they lost money in Whitewater, &quot;everybody knows&quot; Vince Foster was murdered to look like a suicide, she somehow &quot;stole&quot; an election that she lost and conceded, Comet Ping Pong is the world&#39;s most famous pedophilia ring that neighborhood families have rallied around in support - they&#39;ve never fucked up such that they can <em>actually be shown to have broken the law.</em></p>

Somehow they make all these mistakes and get outsmarted by whoever the Republican <em>belle du jour</em> is that day (and every right winger who winks to his buddies and says &quot;I&#39;m too smart to fall for Clinton&#39;s schemes!&quot;) but yet they&#39;re <em>so wily</em> that nobody can catch them doing it. How does that work? The Silk Road guy couldn&#39;t stay out of the hoosegow on account of, what, his chat logs? But the FBI <em>and fucking WikiLeaks</em> has every email that Clinton ever sent to <em>anyone</em> and there&#39;s nothing they can arrest her for?</p>

<p>In the 90&#39;s everyone I knew called him &quot;Slick Willy&quot; on account of how easily Bill Clinton seemed to slip right out of all these scandals. Gosh, maybe the reason that the Clintons &quot;slip out&quot; of all these seemingly career-ending, seemingly <em>deeply criminal enterprises</em> is because those &quot;scandals&quot; are always <em>fucking fantasies</em> engineered by the right-wing to make the diarrhea-frosted fart sundaes running on the Republican side seem more appetizing by comparison? But naw, emails.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Shillary is bought and paid for; we all know this because we all know that politicians in general are bought and paid for.  They are Nascar vehicles, we just don&#39;t have the stickers to show <del>ownership</del> sponsorship.  But what very few seem to be thinking of is who owns Trump?  I think with the number of Big Oil execs and Big Banking execs in his cabinet and thinktank, it&#39;s quite clear that the same good ol&#39; boys own him as well.  If we go to war with Russia, who gains?</p>

<p><strong>The Military Industrial Complex</strong></p>

<p>With war, comes profits.  The biggest profiteers will be those providing the arms, which, at least since the 80&#39;s, are a very limited group of corporations, most of which are American and European.  Do you think they won&#39;t slobber all over themselves at the prospect of a new Cold War?</p>

<p><strong>Big Oil</strong></p>

<p>Or, more exact, Big Gas.  Russia provides huge amounts of natural gas to Europe, but it is <em>state owned</em>, not in the hands of the biggest western companies.  What would happen if the might of the west actually put the final, finishing blows to the Russian state that was severely weakened in the late 80&#39;s?  Likewise, Russia still has a lot of sway with the Oil providing states that are not wrapped around America&#39;s finger, like Syria (where we failed to overthrow the gov&#39;t), Brazil (a large part of the BRIC economies), etc.</p>

<p><strong>The BRIC</strong></p>

<p>If the Elite are hedging their bets, and if America loses or fails to cripple Russia should a war, even a Cold War, be kicked off, the BRIC economies will grow unchecked and America will lose its place atop the world economies.  Business which have sunk capital deeply into these economies (Brazil, Russia, India, Indonesia, and China) will reap huge rewards.  Is this why, before even taking over as president, Trump is busy spitting in China&#39;s face with the Taiwan call and twitter BS?</p>

<p>There are countless other winners and countless other reasons, but these three are the first things that came to my mind.  This sub, at least since T_D swooped through this year, has been VERY concentrated on Shillary as the spark for every bad thing that can happen, but has given Trump a pass even as he selects Cabinet members who are CLEARLY not the choices he swore he&#39;d make (remember his constant harping on Shillary&#39;s speech to Goldman Sachs, what the fuck happened?) throughout his election run.  What I&#39;m saying is that I&#39;m thinking it&#39;s all a long con from the elite like it always has been before.  Trump isn&#39;t a new outsider here to clean up the gov&#39;t, he&#39;s just another chess piece in their arsenal of &quot;Divide and Conquer&quot; and they are winning by doing exactly that.</p>

<p>It&#39;s the Kansas City Shuffle, people.  Everyone&#39;s lookin&#39; left...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>YES! at least the haters/libtards can wait until he makes his cabinet picks to judge him. trump will pick true outsiders who will shake up the establishment and properly represent the working-class people of america (FINALLY!). hillary would have picked corporate insiders like goldman and exxon execs who don&#39;t have the working class interests in mind. once we drain the swamp, we will finally start to see real change and the cucks will have no choice but to admit they were dead wrong. </p>

I&#39;m sure you haven&#39;t noticed that Russia is the leading supporter &amp; supplier of Iran of military and economic aid.

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s not like it&#39;s that hard to find. </p>

<p><a href="https://youtu.be/nUBrZItwVy4">In the effort to prove the credibility of the undercover donor featured in the videos and to keep the investigation going, Project Veritas Action made the decision to donate twenty thousand dollars to Robert Creamer’s effort. Project Veritas Action had determined that the benefit of this investigation outweighed the cost. And it did. In an unexpected twist, AUFC president Brad Woodhouse, the recipient of the $20,000, heard that Project Veritas Action was releasing undercover videos exposing AUFC’s activities. He told a journalist that AUFC was going to return the twenty thousand dollars. He said it was because they were concerned that it might have been an illegal foreign donation. Project Veritas Action was pleased but wondered why that hadn’t been a problem for the month that they had the money. </a></p>

<p>Part one </p>

<p><a href="https://youtu.be/5IuJGHuIkzY">In this explosive new video from Project Veritas Action, a Democratic dirty tricks operative unwittingly provides a dark money trail to the DNC and Clinton campaign. The video documents violence at Trump rallies that is traced to the Clinton campaign and the DNC through a process called birddogging.</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>A shady coordinated communications chain between the DNC, Clinton Campaign, Hillary Clinton’s Super PAC (Priorities) and other organizations are revealed. A key Clinton operative is on camera saying, “It doesn’t matter what the friggin’ legal and ethics people say, we need to win this motherfucker.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I really like the second video. Scott Foval looks right into the little spy lens and doesn&#39;t realize what he is seeing. Goes right on spilling all his most treasured secrets. No wonder they fired him. </p>

<p><a href="https://youtu.be/hDc8PVCvfKs">In the second video of James O&#39;Keefe&#39;s new explosive series on the DNC and Hillary Clinton campaign, Democratic party operatives tell us how to successfully commit voter fraud on a massive scale. Scott Foval, who has since been fired, admits that the Democrats have been rigging elections for fifty years</a></p>

<p>Part Three
<a href="https://youtu.be/EEQvsK5w-jY">Part III of the undercover Project Veritas Action investigation dives further into the back room dealings of Democratic politics. It exposes prohibited communications between Hillary Clinton’s campaign, the DNC and the non-profit organization Americans United for Change. And, it’s all disguised as a duck. In this video, several Project Veritas Action undercover journalists catch Democracy Partners founder directly implicating Hillary Clinton in FEC violations. “In the end, it was the candidate, Hillary Clinton, the future president of the United States, who wanted ducks on the ground,” says Creamer in one of several exchanges. “So, by God, we would get ducks on the ground.” It is made clear that high-level DNC operative Creamer realized that this direct coordination between Democracy Partners and the campaign would be damning when he said: “Don’t repeat that to anybody.” The first video explained the dark secrets and the hidden connections and organizations the Clinton campaign uses to incite violence at Trump rallies. The second video exposed a diabolical step-by-step voter fraud strategy discussed by top Democratic operatives and showed one key operative admitting that the Democrats have been rigging elections for fifty years. This latest video takes this investigation even further.</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>she was a fantastic candidate for president: brilliant, extremely hard-working, admired by everyone who worked with her (including republicans), with hundreds of coveted endorsements from around the world and in the U.S., with detailed policies and how to implement them posted... if she got elected into the White House with Bill at her side, she would have been one of the truly great presidents. It took a cascade of dirty tricks, slander, and unsavory actors and their corrupt schemes in order to make a monster and loser out of her.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think we need less uninformed speculation on this sub.  I don&#39;t mean to put down the OP for his opinions, but the fact this post has nearly 1500 upvotes and includes no sources of information does not reflect well on the users here.  Are there better subreddits that cover similar material out there?  I noticed r/WikiLeaks seems to have good quality posts, but they&#39;re often specific to only &quot;wikileaked&quot; material.</p>

<p>I am starting to think that the best way to get good information on reddit is to add people as friends who give informed views and who don&#39;t overstate their own opinions.  But reading comments with random subjects isn&#39;t all that edifying either.  I don&#39;t know.  Does anyone have any good strategies for quickly cutting through the bullshit?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well you mentioned a lot of things so I will pick some to talk about. &quot;Fake news&quot;: You don&#39;t really say in what way this has to do with Clinton, that&#39;s what I mean by vague. There is always talk about her and the media conspiring over something but you never pin it down on anything specific. &quot;Fake news&quot; is a topic that&#39;s being discussed right now because their influence grows a lot due to facebook etc. Not only in the US, this is an international debate. I don&#39;t see how Clinton can a German newspaper or tv-channel to focus their attention on this.<br/>
&quot;Trump is with Putin&quot; Well, this is negative campaigning against Trump, so it is in favor of Clinton, at least during the election these debates were useful to her. But is it really because Clinton is telling the media to report this? The thing is, that Putin was pro-Trump, this is not a secret. Is it far fetched to then say that Trump in some way is &quot;with Putin&quot;? Given that Trump expressed more than once his love for strong leaders, sometimes dictators, like when he quoted Mussolini or said Hussein was great against terrorists?  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I would be looking for some of the following :</p>

<p>Content source: opinion rag (HuffPo, Bretibart) or one sensitive about accuracy (Economist, FT). </p>

<p>How close the reporters are to the event, and how soon they report (this could be a stream of tweets from people experiencing the event, or journalists from unconnected, non partisan orgs who are there when it happens).</p>

<p>Data sources (I work with primary research so this is my bread and butter): scientific approach which should be in its methodology i.e. purpose was discovery, not reinforcement of predetermined belief.</p>

<p>A lot of newspapers cite polls which are inevitably BS (Daily Mail in particular) - Flat Earth News by Nick Davies explained how many newspaper sources are now PR - think of how many times you&#39;ve read that something will cause cancer - there&#39;s inevitably someone pushing a brand that&#39;s behind the story. </p>

<p>Secondary sources are cited.</p>

<p>Experts not commenting outside their field; their credentials are clear.</p>

<p>In all above cases, they are sceptics and ready to correct themselves if evidence proves them wrong. Also: transparency, particularly valid when government sources can be challenged (am thinking of the judicial enquiries we&#39;ve had in the UK where the authorities were savagely criticised and the witnesses validated).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>These things happen all the time. There were a unique set of circumstances that led into the great war, that had been permeating for years. For starters countries had a whole bunch of new industrial aged weapons they wanted to try out, cultural diversity segregated munch of Europe, infinitely more then the racial tensions of today do. The most important factor though, that&#39;s missing from today, is Bismarckian diplomacy. You could argue that certain treaties do the same job, but you&#39;d be wrong. Bismarck created a spider Web of alliances that were so difficult to untangle that the only option was war. Treaties today always have a get out clause. NATO&#39;s article 5 might seem like a line in the sand for starting WW3, but you can be damned sure if a signatory was attacked by a nuclear power America would find a way out of it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Very interesting, I am just now getting to the Bismarck era. The documentary is implying that he set up a system that could not be sustained after other, less wise, people took the reins after his departure.</p>

<p>I was interested in WW1 because my grandfather served in Europe.</p>

<p>I really know very little about it. The politics, though seems similar throughout history. Inept or overzealous &quot;leaders&quot; make a mess of things, then contrive some ideological or patriotic justification for another round of casualties, graves and further destruction of property.</p>

<p>Thank you.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Exactly. This is my point. Take out Hillary by putting her in jail for her very real crimes and this stack of cards will begin to fall. When a political machine gets this big where it can operate with impunity against laws, you can&#39;t take it out from the bottom. Every effort will get crushed, quashed, silenced or marginalized. A clean strike to the head is what&#39;s needed. Obama is on his way out. He&#39;s stacked the decks in favor of this sort of criminal unconstitutional activity. There was no whisper of alarm from his administration when Bill Clinton colluded with his AG appointment on an airport tarmac to protect Hillary from an investigation. You never heard a whisper about Comey and his huge conflicts of interest. The man should not even have that position. Just putting him there is a huge problem. </p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>But Geraghty said investigators can tell the difference between someone who deliberately downloaded such images and someone who may have inadvertently downloaded perhaps thousands of images because of a virus or misdirected Web site.</p>

<p>&quot;A good forensics expert would try to determine how (the images) got on the computer and who was responsible for putting them there,&quot; he said. &quot;That would be determined by looking at the totality of the evidence, not just the fact that there were images there.&quot;</p>

<p>Things a good investigator would look into include whether the suspect was sitting at the computer at the time the images were downloaded. Was he using the computer to send e-mail or visit other Web sites at the time? &quot;There is always some type of trail we can follow to determine if the person were likely actively involved in the process of downloading the material,&quot; Geraghty said.
Investigators can usually figure out if an image was downloaded intentionally, based on other activity that took place on the computer at the time.</p>

<p>Another indicator is the time lapse between image downloads. A virus or Trojan horse is likely to download multiple images at a time, sometimes faster than might be humanly possible to do manually. A person who collects child pornography typically acquires it over a period of time, and a forensic investigation of the computer should reveal that.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have a question. It&#39;s maybe naive but it bothers me. Why would a person download stuff to his computer like child porn that if found will ruin his life? Discredit him and maybe he ends up in jail? Why do that? Do they get that much pleasure from photos of kids being abused? </p>

<p>Say if I was into animal cruelty, (I&#39;m not). But just say I was, why would I store such things on a hard drive knowing if it gets out I could be ruined.? I&#39;m just trying to understand the motivation to do something so stupid. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>And when shit hits the fan, everyone is going to look around the room and wonder how we got here.. It is frustrating to think I am the only one that thinks like this. The thing is, I&#39;m not the only one. But when I talk about this topic with others like family members or my roommate, they give me a look like, &quot;What the hell is this guy talking about?&quot; So the feeling is lonely in my immediate area, however, I know there are people out there that know something is going on, it&#39;s just an eerily small number of people. </p>

<p>It gets to the point where you just go, &quot;Oh well.&quot; I mean, What the fuck can we do! Things are only going to get worse, I have this feeling like there is going to be some large scale event soon that is going to turn the world upside down and it&#39;ll be conducted by the US government.(or the secret society I.e illuminati, Bilderberg group, whatever you call them) </p>

<p>Can we please conduct our own plan to spread the word. In a way that can keep people&#39;s attention, a list of factual evidence that can open people&#39;s eyes. Like for example, I&#39;ve always wanted to go out to some busy intersection and hand copies of Operation Northwoods.(If you don&#39;t know what that is, Google it) This is something that is real, and in any non-corrupt country, this would lead to the government conspiring to commit treason. But I&#39;m always afraid something would happen to me or something. I don&#39;t know. Maybe I&#39;m crazy. </p>

<p>Oh well</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Fuck no, I don&#39;t make excuses for Hillary. I didn&#39;t vote for her in the primaries because I thought Bernie was the candidate was needed. I saw her faults and I acknowledged them realistically. She&#39;s comes across as super fake and unrelatable and she&#39;s old, but as far as corruption she&#39;s nothing special. She&#39;s been scapegoated for every bad thing that&#39;s ever happened and some that didn&#39;t.</p>

<p>The real conspiracy is that a good proportion of Americans have been brainwashed, not by fluoride or chemtrails, but by simple cognitive  psychology. Ever wonder why Trump always addresses his opponents with his chosen insult, CROOKED Hillary, LYING Ted Cruz. It&#39;s fucking branding, and of course both sides do it, but it&#39;s usually positive. Trump&#39;s entire campaign was a feast of gaslighting and fondling the conservative base. He had a better campaign but it had nothing to do with him actually being president. </p>

<p>Look what he did with the media. He made them look like fools while taking advantage of them for views by acting like a buffoon, then claimed that because comedy shows are hitting his tee balls, the media must be colluding with the Democrats. </p>

<p>Right wing sites blatantly make shit up, but it&#39;s REALLY BAD shit. Secret murders, pedophile rings. If you believe it, Clinton must be a monster but most people don&#39;t bother to find out that it&#39;s bullshit. Then the real media starts reporting on fake news and now everything is fake. Videos, taxes, privacy, laws, the FBI and CIA - none of it matters. Because if you just BELIEVE that Clinton is guilty of murder, well then it all comes together, and our government falls apart.</p>

However when someone threatens the power-hold the &quot;establishment&quot; has, as Trump did, their true sinister colors come out, and they&#39;ve shown us that just as quickly as they&#39;ll use the CIA to corrupt elections and push regime changes in other nations, they&#39;ll lie to us, corrupt their own internal campaigns, and push fake narratives like &quot;fake news&quot; to keep us under their thumb.</p>

<p>The establishment should forever more be seen with utter disdain by anyone with their eyes and ears open.  Anything less is paramount to completely self-imposed ignorance.</p>

<p>Could these be the actions of a desperate woman? Sure.</p>

<p>More likely the actions of a network of desperate criminals... elements within the government/elite that have had power for too long.</p>

<p>Civil War? War with Russia? Nah.</p>

<p>0.009% Chance of electoral college not voting Trump on Monday.</p>

<p>0.0000009% chance of elected Republicans in the house going against the will of the same voters that reelect them.</p>

<p>Brew some tea, have a cookie, and relax man.</p>

<p>Even if Trump is a shit president, we at least have the best chance of doing damage to the shadow government with him elected.</p>

<p>He is definitely not establishment - as evident by nearly every fucking element (including his own party) teaming up against him.</p>

<p>Also, even if the EC or the House went against Trump.. it would lower the citizens trust in the Government and Media even more than its current historic lows. They wouldn&#39;t be able to regain power. The cats out of the bag.</p>

<p>Sorry to tell you this but, that&#39;s what it feels like to be brainwashed by cult politics and conspiracy theories while surrounded by normal people.  I spent a few years checking out online conspiracy theory people.  What you experience is normal for them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hey man I was feeling the same way until I talked to a younger guy yesterday which restored a little faith in humanity for me. This guy is 19 and i assumed he was just like all the other kids of our generation because of the way he carried himself and because he sells weed/party/be the class clown at work etc. But he told me he likes to read books which caught me off guard since I don&#39;t know anybody who still reads a book. Anyways, he starts talking to me about how his friend at a local grocery shop recommended it from their book section and when he described what it was about, it sounded similar to The Finders cult group/PizzaGate and i asked him was this book based on true events and he said yeah. Then I said how that sounds like this group called The Finders and how they were a pedophile cult, to which he got excited and said that THAT was the name of the book but he couldn&#39;t remember the whole name but that THAT is what was going on in the book.</p>

<p>I was fucking surprised. This kid has stumbled upon the rabbit hole without even knowing and I&#39;d like to think that whoever his friend was at that store who recommended the book, he was just nudging him towards it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, she lost because she did not put in the work. She spoke to the public for maybe 15 minutes a week. She disappeared for days at a time. Mostly, she just went to fundraisers with the ultra rich and famous. She didn&#39;t bother visiting Wisconsin for 7 months before the election. She called a quarter of the voters deplorables. Trump was speaking to the public for over 2 hours a day for 18 months. He had hour long policy speeches on each of his positions. Hillary never talked policy once. In order to get a crowd, she had to employ Jay Z, Beyonce and Michelle Obama. It was the white voters in Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin who voted for Obama last time around that went to Trump. It has nothing to do with race or sex. It has to do with feeling included. She was the establishment candidate picked by the 1%. America did not want that. </p>

<p>This GIF sums up why she lost.</p>

But now I feel exactly how they want me to: I don&#39;t care about any of it. It all seems like a lie, they aren&#39;t going to stop lying to us, and they&#39;ll kill us all to preserve their power, even if they finally get caught. I just won&#39;t fight for them.

<p>I do think it&#39;s best that we stop calling what Trump said &quot;locker room talk&quot; though because it wasn&#39;t.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>To be completely fair, we don&#39;t know how much of that was true and how much was ridiculous posturing. Considering the context, taking that conversation overly seriously is a bit of a stretch (again, in my opinion). That does not excuse what he said or the views that he expressed, but I can also understand if there was some hyperbole there. So fair enough - rather than &#39;locker room talk&#39;, what would we call it tho? Bragging over things that may or may not have happened? Do people always tell the truth when they&#39;re bragging about their sexual exploits? </p>

<p>The uncertainty goes both ways. If we shouldn&#39;t jump to indict Clinton, then we should wait for some legitimate charges towards Trump too before we start calling him a sexual criminal. However, they are totally different charges, which was more my original point. Trump has only actually be proven guilty of some shady business practice and paying people off in the court systems - whether that means he was guilty of things before is not certain as we know people get extorted as well. Maybe some were legitimate and others were not. All we can know for sure is what is on record. Trump&#39;s not a great person and certainly not of the character we&#39;d wish for in a president, but Clinton had shown a clear willingness to try to usurp power and I think people are grossed out by that today. The USA was founded in rejection of oligarchy and monarchy - the idea that you had to be born from a certain stock or family to make a difference in the world. If Clinton had won, the last 30+ years of the US Presidency would have been held by 3 family names, and when people started to see her as corrupt, it was over. Corruption is no joke - it even overpowers gender discrimination and racist appeals with its vileness. The 21st Century world is allergic to it, IMO, but that&#39;s a larger discussion....</p>

<p>In the end, I hear your point on both sides being a perspective. I just don&#39;t think there&#39;s a right one of the choices available.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Lmao this post gave me cancer. If you need someone to explain all the ways Hillary is corrupt then you don&#39;t belong on this subreddit. Go back to your echo chambers in r/politics, buddy. Hillary would have done anything to win the election, even if it meant tearing her party apart to become president. </p>

<p>Bernie should have won the nomination. If Hillary would have thought for the better good and not her own selfish aspirations we wouldn&#39;t have Donald as a president. It&#39;s funny how now she&#39;s complaining about voting fraud when it clearly wasn&#39;t an issue to her when it helped her beat Bernie. Seriously, did you just plug your ears this entire election cycle and ignore all the corruption she shamelessly displayed? </p>

<p>She used every damn dirty trick in the book trying to win this election <em>and she still lost</em>. <strong>Thats how unelectable she was and how much the American public hated her.</strong> she couldn&#39;t even win against Donald trump for Christ sakes. The man grabbing people by the pussy. How terrible of a candidate do you have to be to lose to someone like that? </p>

<p>The American public won&#39;t be fooled by people like you who think saying a couple nice things about a corrupt individual will change how people view her. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m right there with you. Didn&#39;t really hit me until I read your comment. It definitely feels like I&#39;m on another planet. My whole family are Hillary supporters (probably Bernie for most but switched when he didn&#39;t get the nomination. That&#39;s a whole other thing). I didn&#39;t support her or trump. And when I talk about anything regarding emails or criminal activity I&#39;m met with fierce resistance or flat out denial from everyone but my sister (probably most level headed). I even fee the same way with my wife who is a trump supporter.</p>

<p>We&#39;re definitely being fed an alternate reality and it&#39;s infuriating seeing that people are denying it believing everything the media is throwing at them. It doesn&#39;t take much to do a bit of research or be critical of what you see and hear.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It is a presupposition according to the original statement.  To date HRC has never been charged and convicted with a crime.  She may be guilty as sin but this has yet to be proven and even if it was true about some crimes it would not be evidence for other crimes she is accused about doing.  Critical thinking 101.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m fine with the fact that most people are quite happy to be sheep plugged ivy the matrix.</p>

<p>What&#39;s gotten insanely scary to be lately is how my once Libertarian and skeptical friends have recently fallen back into the mainstream media trance simply because they don&#39;t like Trump. I don&#39;t ask that you love  Trump, but I do ask that you stay clear eyed.</p>

<p>Smart people are willingly re-inserting themselves because it&#39;s all just gotten so confusing and overwhelming. That&#39;s a terrible thing. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I keep trying to buffer my &quot;crazy conspiracy theory talk&quot; with jokes about my tin foil hat and a future standing outside the mall with a bullhorn and a cardboard peace sign talking about what &quot;they&quot; are really doing.</p>

<p>Amazing how absolutely fking angry people--and I&#39;m talking actual friends and family--can get at me for questioning the narratives were told. Like the media is divine gospel. Makes me so sick. Makes me furious... but of course I can&#39;t get angry back or I discredit entirely any ounce of progress I may have made convincing them, not of my perspective, but just that there are gaping holes in the narrative that it would be worth looking into.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m deeply embarrassed by my post history from right after Bernie lost.  I&#39;m a small business owner with a Leftie bent so he was my guy.  The kind of person who wants to pay above minimum wage to give his subordinates dignity, you know.  Anyway.  I was so outraged beyond reason I latched onto anything that gave me hope for small business at all.  So I took Hillary as &quot;the next best thing&quot; and started to bellow against Trump supporters.  But the fight was all staged.  Hillary was laying smoke screen over smoke screen and the only thing I&#39;m mad at now is myself for getting distracted by it all.  And I&#39;m disappointed in others for continuing to fall for the fumbling shenanigans of a fallen Nazi idiot and the hisses of all her greedy, shameless shills.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well said. People who think reality isn&#39;t reality tend to believe the universe is simulated or a dream-like world. This being a simulated reality would conlict with our free will, which you could argue we do not have because simulations don&#39;t have free will. The test then would be to see how far our Will stretches. This is largely undocumented in science because of &quot;unreplicable&quot; results (because the same will/intent is not there). </p>

<p>I don&#39;t mean to come off as arrogant, it&#39;s just that in comparing those two options, simulation seems highly unlikely. A lot of prole propose the simulation but don&#39;t go further than that. Whats the purpose? Who is the creator? Why do anything if you knew you were in a simulation?</p>

<p>That last question leaves a gap in the theory. Unless the purpose of the simulation were to see how we react in the face of that Truth? Simulation seems out of the question, and of course that could just be a reaction to not being able to accept that Truth, but so many people wouldn&#39;t have knowledge and memories of past lives and other dimensions were that not actually the Truth.</p>

<p>I&#39;m really wanting to find holes in either theory. I&#39;d want to know whatever the Truth was</p>
