<p><strong>We do not advocate vigilantism, and suspects are considered innocent until proven guilty.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Disinformation Warning</strong>:  Beware &quot;black propaganda&quot;, a tactic used to disrupt and discredit our investigation. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_propaganda">Black propaganda</a> involves statements or actions which are made to appear to come from one side of a conflict, but actually come from the other side, like political ventriloquism.  Disinformants, or &quot;shills,&quot; anonymously promote intentionally fake evidence and claims, which can then be used to paint our central thesis as false.  People familiar with debate can think of it as a &quot;straw man.&quot; This is not to say that legitimate researchers do not make mistakes, but to caution all readers that disinformants are actively attempting to disrupt this forum&#39;s efforts.  <strong>However, all evidence included in this summary is directly verifiable through embedded weblinks.</strong></p>

<p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY AND EXPLANATION OF PIZZAGATE</strong></p>

<p><strong>Introduction</strong></p>

<p>This investigation was sparked by strange emails leaked from John Podesta&#39;s email account, some of which make bizarre references to food.  These references make sense when we discover they involve known <a href="https://i.sli.mg/3tJhM5.png">pedophile codewords</a> like <a href="https://archive.is/QsLdx">cheese pizza</a>.<br/>
<strong>The suspected use of &quot;pizza&quot; as a codeword led us to investigate a pizza restaurant mentioned in one of Podesta&#39;s emails, namely Comet Pizza and Ping Pong, owned by an associate of the Podestas.  We have found considerable evidence that Comet is a front for child sex trafficking.</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Exhibit A: Evidence Pertaining to Comet Pizza and Ping Pong</strong></p>

<p>Comet owner <a href="https://i.sli.mg/h6EHML.jpg">James Alefantis</a> had a statue of <a href="https://archive.is/J3lUH">Antinous</a> as his Instagram profile picture.  Antinous was the boy lover of a Roman Emperor, and is considered a symbol of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pederasty">pederasty</a>.  On his &quot;jimmycomet&quot; Instagram account, Alefantis posted a picture of a baby, calling her <a href="https://i.sli.mg/2FyXrV.png">sexually promiscuous</a>.  He also posted another <a href="http://archive.is/DLjk7">baby picture</a> and made <a href="http://archive.is/uvDYq">a clear pedophile reference</a>.  The brother of Jeffrey B. Smith (&quot;werkinonmahnightcheese&quot;), who commented on several of the suspect Instagram photos, referred to a friend as <a href="https://i.sli.mg/Ri9pxk.jpg">&quot;my favorite pedo&quot;</a>.  </p></li>
</ul>

<p>Alefantis posted a photo of <a href="https://i.sli.mg/0woG5J.png">a child taped to a ping pong table</a>, and a photo of a <a href="http://archive.is/oRj63">walk-in cooler</a>, to which he commented &quot;#murder&quot; and to which Jeffrey B. Smith commented &quot;#killroom.&quot; Alefantis also posted a picture of Tony Podesta’s <a href="https://archive.is/LIHTn">sculpture modeled after a Dahmer victim</a>, a picture of <a href="https://archive.is/JidYE">satan</a>, and spiritcooking queen herself <a href="https://i.sli.mg/laESt4.png">Marina Abramovic</a>.  In their washroom, Comet had a painting of a man playing ping pong, to which graffiti had been added to show him <a href="https://i.sli.mg/lu0Uf9.png">ejaculating on the table and wearing a Satanic upside-down cross</a>.  Comet had <a href="http://archive.is/UOnP9">paintings of children with their heads cut off</a> and murals in their restaurant of <a href="http://archive.is/uOy6R">heads cut off</a>.  </p>

<p>Listed first on Comet&#39;s website under <a href="http://archive.is/Yogml">&quot;friends of comet&quot;</a> is the band <a href="http://archive.is/hMfkx">Heavy Breathing</a>, which performs at Comet.  Heavy Breathing leader &quot;Majestic Ape&quot; wears a ski mask and sunglasses, and uses a voice modulator, hiding his or her identity.  Majestic Ape joked about pedophile Jared Fogle and said <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vlhBn_zSIro&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=1m23s">&quot;we all have our preferences, hee hee hee&quot;. </a>, bringing laughter from the audience.  In another video, Majestic Ape <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9itWsqzFMVo">talks about killing a baby</a>.  Majestic Ape also <a href="https://i.sli.mg/1SYxRM.png">referenced pedophilia in a caption on a music video</a>.  Heavy Breathing&#39;s website features art involving both <a href="http://archive.is/hMfkx">children and sex</a>.</p>

<p>An employee of Comet posted many images <a href="http://archive.is/mKH6M">portraying pizza in a sexual way.</a>, further fueling our suspicion they are using &quot;pizza&quot; as it is commonly used by pedophiles: a symbol and codeword for sex with minors.  <a href="https://i.sli.mg/r1x646.jpg">Another example</a>.</p>

<p>Please examine these <a href="http://archive.is/vNEnH">symbols</a> designated by the FBI as pedophile symbols.  Besta Pizza, which is <a href="https://i.sli.mg/bJwpuH.png">three doors down</a> from Comet, <a href="http://archive.is/25DMq">had a logo</a> that is a near-exact match of <a href="http://archive.is/PUWFe">the boylover symbol</a>.  Another nearby business, Terasol, had a <a href="https://i.sli.mg/xaRHyg.png">girl-lover symbol</a> on their website.  No direct connection to Besta or Terasol has yet been uncovered, but the logos seem quite a coincidence.  With that in mind, take a look at Comet&#39;s logo.   It also resembles a <a href="http://archive.is/vNEnH">pedophile symbol</a>.  </p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Exhibit B: Evidence Pertaining to John and Tony Podesta</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>John Podesta is the former Chief of Staff to President Bill Clinton, and was the Chair of Hillary Clinton&#39;s presidental campaign.  Tony Podesta runs The Podesta Group, a major lobbying firm.
The Podestas are associates of James Alefantis, as detailed in Exhibit C.  They are also <strong><a href="http://archive.is/8F945">good friends</a> with known and admitted pedophile, former Republican congressman <a href="https://archive.is/VJ9Gz">Dennis Hastert</a></strong>.  John Podesta received en email suggesting that Hastert shoud <a href="http://archive.is/lHCPi">vanish to an undisclosed Japanese island</a> after the news of Hastert&#39;s pedophilia broke.  </p>

<p>Now, let&#39;s discuss the specific emails that led to our investigation of Comet.  </p>

<p>John Podesta received an email from Tam Luzzatto saying that children of ages 11, 9, and 7 will be &quot;in the pool for further entertainment&quot; and stating that the children <a href="http://archive.is/lgD3l">&quot;will definitely be in that pool&quot;</a>. </p>

<p>In another email, Podesta was told that he left behind a <a href="http://archive.is/JJC1o">black-and-white handkerchief &quot;with a map that seems pizza-related&quot;</a>.  A handkerchief with a &quot;pizza-related&quot; map?  What the...?  It begins to make sense when we discover that handkerchiefs are sometimes used as <a href="http://archive.is/MfPCc">code for sexual preferences,</a>, and victims of pedophilia express that it’s collected as a souvenir after being placed <a href="https://i.sli.mg/kHXqhi.jpg">under the victim</a>.  Black and white symbolize bdsm/domination and pedophilia, respectively.  Furthermore, as discussed previously, &quot;pizza&quot; is a common codeword for child sex abuse.  The meaning of &quot;map&quot; here is unclear.</p>

<p>In another suspiciously cryptic email, a friend complained that Podesta had changed &quot;strategies that have long been in place&quot; and remarked that Podesta sent him &quot;cheese&quot; instead of &quot;pasta,&quot; asking if Podesta thought he would do better <a href="http://archive.is/JBft7">&quot;playing dominoes on cheese than on pasta&quot;</a>.  Why would Podesta regularly send this person pasta, why would there need to be a strategy long in place for doing so, and who plays dominoes on cheese or pasta?  &quot;Cheese&quot; is a known pedophile codeword for little girls, whereas &quot;pasta&quot; is a known codeword for little boys.  &quot;Dominoes&quot; seems likely to be code for domination/bdsm, especially given other evidence pertaining to the Podestas, as detailed below.</p>

<p>Tony Podesta sent John Podesta an email titled &quot;Last night was fun.&quot; The email read simply <a href="http://archive.is/9PcWi">&quot;still in the torture chamber&quot;</a>. </p>

<p>One could argue this could have been a metaphor, but consider it in light of the fact that Tony Podesta collects art by Biljana Djurdjevic, which references or depicts <a href="http://archive.is/xyW2L">extreme physical and sexual abuse of children</a>.  He also collects <a href="https://archive.fo/vddrO">photos of naked teenagers</a>, and he has a taste for art portraying cannibalism and murder, such as his <a href="http://archive.is/9aq42">headless Arch of Hysteria statue</a> which seems to reproduce <a href="http://archive.is/tAsqV">one of Jeffrey Dahmer&#39;s decapitated victims</a>. John Podesta also likes artwork portraying cannibalism, such as <a href="http://archive.is/LEKyL">this piece is in his office</a>.  </p>

<p><strong>Also, consider the above in light of numerous references to Satanism and the Occult surrounding Comet Pizza and Ping Pong.</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Exhibit C: Alefantis&#39; Connections to the Podestas and Clintons</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>James Alefantis himself was deemed one of the <a href="https://archive.is/f7tAX/56dbfa7c950595f6268da07c508278d2e0aad852.png">50 most powerful people of Washington D.C</a> by GQ magazine.<br/>
He was the <a href="https://archive.is/WoJJY">romantic partner</a>of <a href="https://i.sli.mg/p58Eks.png">David Brock</a>.  David Brock is the <a href="http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2012/02/27/media-matters-boss-paid-former-partner-850g-blackmail-settlement.html">Chief of Media Matters</a>, a major instrument of the Democratic Party.  Brock is also the founder of Correct the Record, a Super PAC that supported the Clinton campaign.</p>

<p>James Alefantis is seen with Tony Podesta <a href="http://archive.is/FvXp0">here</a> and<a href="http://archive.is/QOZgU">here</a>.  An email from Alefantis to Tony Podesta, which <a href="https://archive.is/1mlFy">Tony Podesta forwarded to John Podesta</a> had an attached file which was an <a href="https://i.sli.mg/ETRtRT.png">image of Hillary’s Logo with a pizza slice in it, above a Comet logo</a>.  Alefantis also <a href="https://i.sli.mg/7eXBLj.png.">made desserts for a Clinton campaign event</a>  (Notice another photo with Alefantis and Tony Podesta together, and that Alefantis visited the White House on at least five occasions.)  Clinton <a href="http://archive.is/vX6AT">personally thanked Alefantis</a> for cooking for one of her fundraisers.  </p>

<p>Comet also received donations of over $20k from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Bridge_21st_Century">American Bridge 21st Century PAC</a>, a primary funder of which is billionaire Clinton-backer George Soros.  Donations can be seen <a href="http://docquery.fec.gov/cgi-bin/fecimg/?14960793887">here</a>, <a href="http://docquery.fec.gov/cgi-bin/fecimg/?13941306270">here</a>, and <a href="http://docquery.fec.gov/cgi-bin/fecimg/?13940775420">here</a>.</p>

<p><strong>All this, yet Alefantis claims he has NEVER MET Hillary Clinton.  Was he ordered to distance himself from Clinton after this scandal went viral?</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Exhibit D: Additional Evidence Implicating the Clintons Specifically</strong><br/></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>NOTE:  All previously cited evidence implicates the Clintons, as John Podesta has been their right-hand man, and as James Alefantis is closely associated with the Clinton Campaign and major Democratic Party leaders.</strong></p>

<p>Bill Clinton is known to have flown multiple times on the <a href="https://archive.is/B6nnX">&quot;Lolita Express&quot;</a> of disgraced billionaire pedophile <a href="https://archive.is/vVTYC">Jeffery Epstein</a> to visit Epstein&#39;s private &quot;pedophile island,&quot; Little St. James.  Hillary Clinton also joined him on occasion.  Bill Clinton even <a href="https://archive.is/5o7Zl">ditched the Secret Service to make these trips</a>  Interestingly, Jeffrey Epstein <a href="https://archive.is/PCN83">claimed to be a co-founder of the Clinton Foundation</a>.  </p>

<p>A woman named Laura Silsby was caught trafficking children in Haiti, and Hillary was sent <a href="https://archive.is/QBV6S">emails regarding her updates</a>.  Laura Silsby was let <a href="https://archive.is/O3sUC">off the hook</a> by a Clinton-appointed <a href="https://archive.is/ZMN5U">convicted sex trafficker</a>.  </p>

<p><a href="https://www.clintonfoundation.org/about/board-directors#FrankGiustra">Frank Giustra</a> owner of the Radcliffe Foundation is on the board of directors for the Clinton Foundation, and is a major Clinton Foundation donor.   <a href="https://i.sli.mg/jg6KfI.jpg">The logo of Elpida Home</a>, a refugee center founded by the Radcliffe Foundation, happens to be almost identical to the pedophile <a href="http://archive.is/PUWFe">boylover symbol</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Now we must reveal a spark, before Podesta&#39;s strange emails, that fueled this investigation.</strong></p>

<p>A purported FBI leaker posted claims on 4chan&#39;s &quot;/pol/,&quot; an anonymous poltical forum.  Admittedly, the forum he chose is not exactly reputable.  However, this fits with his claim that he wanted to surround himself with noise in order to prevent his FBI superiors from detecting him, and it fits because he knew many in that anti-Clinton audience would take him seriously and investigate, employing what the forum&#39;s users call &quot;weaponized autism.&quot;  The alleged leaker&#39;s central claim was that the NYPD and FBI had discovered immensely scandalous information about Hillary Clinton through Anthony Weiner&#39;s laptop, but the FBI is not yet acting on the information for reasons we will not discuss here.  For our purposes, the relevant allegation is this:  The purported leaker alleged that <strong>the Clinton Foundation is a front for human trafficking, including child sex trafficking.</strong> He told us, &quot;Dig deep and you will find it. It&#39;s sickening.&quot;  Well, we&#39;ve been digging, and we seem to be finding it.</p>

<p>Summaries of the leaker&#39;s claims can be found here: <a href="https://churchmousec.wordpress.com/2016/11/02/fbi-anon-speaks-part-1/">Part 1</a>; <a href="https://churchmousec.wordpress.com/2016/11/03/fbi-anon-speaks-part-2/">Part 2</a>; <a href="https://churchmousec.wordpress.com/2016/11/04/fbi-anon-speaks-part-3/">Part 3</a>.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Exhibit E: Media Coverup Efforts</strong></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>The same establishment elites who try to control politics also control the mainstream media (this includes Fox News).  They do not want corruption of this magnitude to be exposed.</strong>  As soon as word of Pizzagate went viral, the mainstream media began a coverup campaign.  They began denouncing the allegations as &quot;false,&quot; &quot;hoax,&quot; and &quot;fake news,&quot; without directly addressing the evidence.  </p>

<p>Prima facie, the media have no basis for labeling an <em>ongoing investigation</em>, which is entirely rooted in real evidence, as &quot;fake news.&quot;  In fact, Pizzagate is not an allegation of a specific, individual crime (e.g. the abuse of a specific child on a specific day and time).  Rather, it is an <em>investigation</em> into the possibility of certain individuals being involved in certain kinds of criminal activity.  Therefore, labeling Pizzagate &quot;false/hoax/fake&quot; is patently absurd and dishonest, especially considering the media&#39;s refusal to address the evidence directly.</p>

<p><strong>Reddit CEO Steve Huffman banned the Pizzagate research community from Reddit on bogus grounds</strong>, accusing us of engaging in a &quot;witch hunt,&quot; even though we only used publicly-available information, and never called for vigilantism or harrassment of any kind.  While we understand Reddit may have had legitimate concerns of legal action, there is plenty of reason and evidence to believe the decision was politically motivated. </p>

<p><strong>Bot accounts denying Pizzagate have been discovered on Twitter.</strong>  Twitter has also been suspending users who discuss Pizzagate, and Facebook has plans to censor what it deems &quot;fake news.&quot;</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Exhibit F: Further Supporting Evidence and Historical Precedents</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>There was a 1994 <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY-F5JoHoho">Discovery Channel Documentary</a> that covered pedophilia rampant in our government, but it was banned and never aired.  </p>

<p>Washington Post <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/sex-slavery-isnt-just-a-problem-overseas/2016/01/15/bc3acb04-badd-11e5-829c-26ffb874a18d_story.html?utm_term=.c80f9d44978a">reported that sex slavery is a big problem in D.C.</a></p>

<p>A leaked government email in which  pizza is obviously a code word: <a href="https://wikileaks.org/gifiles/docs/18/18817_re-headcount-for-pizza-.html">&quot;Who all is in the Austin office today who is going to want pizza? We only have one slice and we need to know how thinly to slice it.&quot;</a></p>

<p>The largest pedophile ring ever discovered was <a href="https://truthkings.com/days-recovering-weiner-hard-drive-fbi-makes-large-child-sex-trafficking-raid/">exposed by the FBI</a> coincidentally after Anthony Weiner&#39;s laptop was taken.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Four sets of questions for pizzagate believers:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>What happened to the real evidence that the NYPD supposedly had and was going to leak?</p></li>
<li><p>Gag orders come from judges, and the FBI don&#39;t just take cases from jurisdictions (refer to the faq on their website), so when is the NYPD going to leak the evidence you and others claim exist? In addition, obstruction of justice wouldn&#39;t be applicable as the party accused would have had to lie while speaking with investigators.</p></li>
<li><p>Considering pizzagate is now worldwide, why aren&#39;t the NYPD or FBI corroborating your claims? Why aren&#39;t they asking for anyone with public information to come forward like they would do in any investigation that is known to the public?</p></li>
<li><p>If the FBI is doing an investigation, there is no doubt that the investigation will come into play in Welch&#39;s trial. So, why would the FBI charge Welch before their investigation is complete? </p></li>
