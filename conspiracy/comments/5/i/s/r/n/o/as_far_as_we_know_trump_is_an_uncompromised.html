It&#39;s really shocking how many GS, CFR, Bilderberg guys he can meet with and appoint, yet we still have these morons. &quot;Give him 100 days&quot;, imagine people saying that about HRC as she&#39;s appointing obvious insiders.

<p>It sucks but it is what it is - elderly can&#39;t always contribute the way that they did when they were younger.  And if you&#39;ve busted your ass to contribute to society for 50-60 years, frankly you deserve to be taken care of when your body is no longer capable.  Also, its important to remember that we really do have the resources to make it work- the reason we don&#39;t is because we are being squeezed dry by a greedy elitist and banking class that has no accountability for the bullshit that they pull with funds</p>

<li>Resort to working (not a 9-5, what ever their skill is)</li>

<p>It would be no different under Socialism. What can you contribute, or are you just a worthless mouth to feed. </p>

<p>We do not have the money, the government does not have the money. They rob from others. The government produces nothing, yet you think we should give the government the responsibility to allocate funds to people? They are complete shit at it. </p>

<p>I&#39;ll ask you. How much of your own money, have you made a consciousness decision to donate? If you say none, well your a problem, and do not contempt me. I donate and pay taxes. My donations go to good causes and people I meet in my community, my taxes go to politician&#39;s slush funds and are widely misappropriated. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Lots. </p>

<p>Reallocate some bureaucracy to issues more beneficial to the whole, strengthen a colonial constitutional right. Perhaps raise morale a tad overall, but the other side (idealists, not realists imo)  will still not see why expansion is necessary. </p>

<p>If you are familiar with firearms and &quot;cans&quot; as they call them then you know a silencer doesn&#39;t really muffle much. It&#39;s still loud and the percentage of them being found in a crime scene are extremely low. Only a subsonic round will get that &quot;din&quot;. </p>

<p>Perhaps grow a market a little. </p>

<p>Just some thoughts. I believe society has not tapped into that special thing yet, and until that moment happens, guns are pretty necessary. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m from one of those &quot;strange&quot; areas of the USA that leans democratic but loves guns.  If the US could manage more than a two-party state it would probably be libertarian.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t feel that there&#39;s much more of a legitimate private market for silencers than there is now.  The era of parlor shooting is pretty much gone, and unlike concealed carry I don&#39;t see much reason that an average citizen needs more access to a silenced weapon than they do now.  Hell, one of my ex-girlfriends has a class-3 license.  They&#39;re not hard to come by legally</p>

<p>None of what you&#39;ve said has given a viable reason for removing silencers.  Honestly I think that unregulating them would cause an upspike in violent crime due to people thinking that it would conceal the crime.</p>
