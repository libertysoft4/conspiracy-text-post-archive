<p>Excerpt:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I shall not say their names right now but I have many big plans to expose all of you disgusting, sadistic fucks. okay? that is all, I shall save that for another time. but however, I shall REPEAT...that was just an introduction to the reptilian family leading all the way back. <strong>they call themselves The Black Nobility</strong>. now that is just one part of it. alright? The Black Nobility, the reptilian family ??? all the way back from ancient times. so which they think, they feel like they are the divine chosen ones. from whom may I ask? definite definitely not God, our creator of the world. reptilians. <strong>they feast on blood, children the pedophilia ring, recently busted. ohhh it’s been going on for centuries.</strong> parents listen to me carefully.... <strong>hundreds of missing children come up every year. you wonder...why? how? how could this be? and then there’s this so-called CPS or whatever they’re called they they come and take your children just for nothing.</strong>  alright? not to discredit everybody cuz not everybody’s bad. some are the bad people. and they take your kids...they take them as this...they treat them like...I can’t even say the word. disgusting, it’s sadistic....anyways, so there are these CLONING CENTERS where they take your children and do sadistic things to them. I’m not even talking about child molestation here.... it is so highly sinful....they take your children: they not only molest them, mindfuck them and...make them shoot each other. they give them guns. it’s either you shoot him or I’m gunna shoot you. they’re mind you they’re children.... do you know how long this has been going on? <em>sigh</em> alright, I’m gunna calm down but...as a parent and I love parents out there...in the end, you shall all know why I am so passionate about exposing every single one of these scumbags. okay? the truth shall prevail and you all will know why. so as for you parents, there are no words to describe. but let me just expose because you can’t just...there is a point where you cannot just turn the other way. you know this stuffs going on and you go oh well y’know that’s there problem. lets just turn the other cheek. how long are you gunna turn the other cheek until it happens to your own freaking children... so pick one: you’re either one of us, the good guys or your part of the others. that is, simple as that. two choices: good guys, bad guys... <strong>you know why they love children? because they’re innocent souls, they’re innocent...they’re they’re they’re the most innocent pure beings in this planet. they’re not harmed by anything. they are new to the world, bright-eyed pure innocent children. that is why these disgusting pedophile and these clone rings, cloning centers, satanic rituals, Brownsville, Texas. there are many of the cloning centers where they take your children that go missing</strong>. and you wonder why what happens to them? I’m sorry to break this to you but that is what happens. now either go you want to know what happens to them or do you want to turn the freaking cheek? that is all. tune in to my next show. I am gunna upload stuff, I have an arsenal ready to blow up. okay? I have reason behind this. you all should know my personal reason soon. but this has nothing to do with me right now. but just know that I I’m I am back, I am back with a vengeance.... I’m gunna end it at that. and to all the parents family and children out there, I love you so much. I...have to maintain composure because that is what I do. that is all. over n out.</p>

<p>Celebrity Tila Tequila: Missing Children &amp; Cloning Centers
Tila Tequila talks about missing children and cloning centers on November 7, 2012. This is the only time that she mentioned cloning centers </p>

<p>Tila Tequila said all that a little after her &quot;brain aneurysm&quot; and &quot;overdose&quot; in 2012: <a href="http://radaronline.com/exclusives/2012/03/tila-tequila-hospitalized-brain-aneurism-drug-overdose-almost-died/">http://radaronline.com/exclusives/2012/03/tila-tequila-hospitalized-brain-aneurism-drug-overdose-almost-died/</a></p>

<p>She had been whistleblowing about the iIluminati before her hospitalization: 
<a href="http://theydontseethroughus.blogspot.ru/2012/03/tila-tequilas-dangerous-crusade-against.html?m=1">http://theydontseethroughus.blogspot.ru/2012/03/tila-tequilas-dangerous-crusade-against.html?m=1</a></p>

<p>You can see in the excerpt from her blog she is rationally and articulately talking about the satanic imagery in gaga&#39;s music videos and the media, hollywood and establishment&#39;s plans for a new world order.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Now I was hesitant to write this blog as I know they are forever watching and are very POWERFUL. But I feel as a HUMAN BEING, people have a RIGHT to know what is happening to them and I am here, God sent me here, to fight this War against the Darkness and these people who practice Satanic Rituals, that is now being shown on our TV for even CHILDREN to watch! I mean, Lady GaGa hung herself at one of the music video awards with blood dripping everywhere! Now on her new “ALEJANDRO” cover there is a devil-like man carrying her naked, lifeless body, with a HUGE SLIT on the side of her and blood. Yet people think that’s ok just because it’s “ART?” no.</p>

<p>Ok well if you guys are interested, i will tell you more. This is just the first level, i can take you deep, deep, deep into this and teach you so much more about the crazy mad poop that has been going on, and who is in alliance with who. You would be SHOCKED to know. But just know, they “THEY” have been lying to you guys for a VERY LONG TIME!</p>

<p>I gotta go now, don’t wanna cause too much commotion about this before they come and do me wrong again. I will tell you one day how they did me wrong because I knew stuff about them. MAJOR stuff about them and once they found out that I knew, the did some fracked up poop. They own the majority of the media. They can do and say whatever they want, Anyway, enough for now….</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Now, Something obviously happened to her. she tweets crazy shit all the time, including stuff about how she descended from an alien race that comes from the stars: <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2016/01/tila-tequila-claims-shes-an-alien-the-messiah-and-human-crack-co/">https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2016/01/tila-tequila-claims-shes-an-alien-the-messiah-and-human-crack-co/</a></p>

<p>My theory: she got mk ultra&#39;d or cloned for talking too much.</p>

<p>Remember they won Eurovision too. Perhaps the European elites are the most powerful satsnists if they can get them to win Eurovision... </p>

Progressives hate GWAR, and their only appearance on mainstream media was an episode of Redeye and some talk shows and stuff. They were pretty apolitical and more into the joke and putting on their ridiculous shows. Also, I&#39;ve been to a GWAR show. There weren&#39;t any kids there.</p>

<p>Plus no one has given a shit about GWAR since their frontman died a couple years ago. </p>

<p>And eh I&#39;m not saying he didn&#39;t really OD. But I definitely see a difference in his music. Listening to to slim shady LP to the marshal matters 2 LP there&#39;s a huge difference. And it could have easily been used as a cover story for his change in actions. Recovery was not that great IMO. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>lol sorry, I&#39;m multitasking at the moment. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t think his overdose was suspicious in the slightest. He struggled with alcohol and drug abuse for years prior. Also attempted suicide several years before he met Dre. As people get older, styles change. He was a lot older when he released Recovery, with adult daughters. Not uncommon for musicians with career longevity. </p>

<p>His feud with the government was never based on conspiracy theories. It was based on their attempt to censor music due to its content and language. </p>

<p>And yeah I agree that people change as they age. And that he was really just angry at those trying to censor him.. But the government didn&#39;t take that message as only to them. Eminem almost &quot;preached&quot; it in White America. Calling out there treatment of the first amendment. </p>

<p>Stand alone songs is kinda hard to say. DOOM as an artist goes amazing when listening to his album in its entirety. </p>

<p>I&#39;d try Accordion, Figaro, Rhinestone Cowboy, beef rapp (intro is about 1:00 or so long, feel free to skip it), mr. Clean, Fazers.... Also, for fazers it&#39;s under King geedorah, and mr clean is under viktor Vaughn. </p>

<p>If you want albums lemme know. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Google the LIDA machine. A POW from Korean war says he was tortured using that. It basically induces a sleep+dream like state in the target, making them more susceptible to torture because they are mentally defenseless. So you can induce via satellite (using same EMR wave frequencies as LIDA machine used) artificial dreams where information is projected into the mind like a movie, such as movies of rape and torture. Directed energy weapons can be used to create pain sensations.</p>

<p>Often it won&#39;t be done just via satellite but also stalking (like how scientologists stalk dissidents - called &quot;fair game&quot;) to create stress. That&#39;s why so many victims refer to it as &quot;gangstalking&quot;.</p>

<p>So for example Tila getting a bottle thrown at her head could just be a random act of violence, or something the CIA arranged. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you believe that MK ULTRA programming exists (and who doesn&#39;t after doing thorough research?), then you should understand why these mind control slaves lose it.</p>

<p>Look around and see the patterns that emerge of celebrities breaking from their programming. Either the things they say are real, or these horrors have been coded into them as reality. TPTB have the tools to make anyone lose it; and these are fragile people with broken minds, already. Drugs are a big part of the programming, and also the only way these people have to escape from the nightmare. We should understand that when we criticize them for addiction. Hard drugs are given to children at very young ages (infants, even). How could they not become addicted?</p>

<p>I look back at the &quot;Leave Britney Alone!&quot; incident and have a lot more sympathy for that person, now. Making fun of the torture these people endure is extremely cruel.</p>

<p>I mean, we are over in pizzagate trying to &quot;save the children&quot;, and then mocking the ones who survived into adult slavehood. We should think about that.</p>

<p>The programmers (such as celebrities) are only successful because of their programming. When they try to break free, we should help them, not hate them for it.</p>

<p>By the way, we are all subject to the programming (yes, even you!). Consider the way you felt when you learned that Bill Cosby was a sexual predator, and how it tarnished his legacy and made his comedy so much less funny. Now, apply that to most every celebrity and sports figure that you idolize; because most of them have joined allegiance with the darkness, in one way or another; or are tools of the darkness from childhood. If it hurts you to imagine giving up your sports fandom, your favorite music, TV and movies, then you are a victim of Mind Control.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Don&#39;t know if you&#39;re a Pizzagate denier or only asking a legit question. So I&#39;ll answer anyway. Pizzagate is not about a secret basement in Comet Pizza where people gather and do nasty things. No, that&#39;s only MSM trying to get control of the narrative and make the believers look like idiots. Pizzagate is about a sistemic problem in our society - pedo sex rings funded by government figures that do (allegedly) some of the stuff described in this post.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I wouldn&#39;t say I am a Pizzagate denier, but I will admit am a skeptic of it. I do believe there are pedophilia rings run by elites...not too convinced by the connections to alefantis and the podesta (yes, I am well-initiated on the evidence, I just don&#39;t feel fully convinced).</p>

<p>Anyway, my question was sincere, but I should explain what I am thinking. Pedophilia sex rings are not a new conspiracy, nor are reptilians, clone centers, etc. I have been noticing a trend on this sub to label everything that has even a slight connection to pedophilia conspiracies (sometimes no pedophilia, but just a conspiracy) as &quot;Pizzagate&quot;. I&#39;m going to have to disagree with you, and say Pizzagate <em>is</em> the conspiracy for podesta/alefantis/comet connections to pedophilia rings, and shouldn&#39;t be the label for all pedophile ring conspiracies.  IMO from the get-go Pizzagate had a branding issue, if you will, because it went viral under a pretty dumb name, and IMO with pretty tenuous proof. I think a lot of people who are just getting into conspiracy theories via Pizzagate are the ones who are tying all of these things together and wanting to unite under the Pizzagate banner, but IMO that is putting all your eggs in one basket.</p>

<p>So, I would actually say it is a disservice to pull more conspiracies into Pizzagate. This post talks about reptilians and clone centers alongside brief mentions of pedophilia... you mention MSM using comet to make the theory sound crazy, but I would argue it is dubious connections to the craziest of conspiracies (i.e. reptilians and clone centers) that will discredit Pizzagate if they are considered part of the same conspiracy. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Pretty much.  As much as I think that having a reptilian humanoid species on this planet would be cool, it&#39;s not happening.</p>

<p>And hey, here&#39;s some science for it: there are no bipedal reptiles on the planet.  None.  The closest descendants are a handful of bipedal land-based birds, of which most are sadly extinct.  These species diverged from reptiles so long ago that it&#39;s ridiculous.  There&#39;s also no morphology in reptiles or birds that allows for a truly upright-walking bipedal organism with useable upper limbs.  Bird limbs (ie - wings) are either vestigial or bound to an elongated breastplate.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>People take that theory way too literally. I see it this way:</p>

<p>The reptilian section of the brain is theorized to be dominant psychopaths and sociopaths. These types of people tend to rise to prominence through their willingness, and perhaps need, to commit evil. In that sense, reptilian predators of humanity are very real.</p>

<p>Pushing this narrative a little further, let us say some people with &quot;broader&quot; senses beyond what most humans can normally detect, may see such people manifest as a reptile. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Then why do you call it a &#39;cloning facility&#39; and why do you talk about &#39;reptile people&#39;. You could say &#39;sociopathic people&#39; and &#39;mind control&#39; if that&#39;s actually what you&#39;re getting at.</p>

<p>And if we&#39;re going back to David Ike here- no, he literally believes in reptilian humanoids. There is no second-layer metaphor to that. He&#39;s very blunt.</p>
