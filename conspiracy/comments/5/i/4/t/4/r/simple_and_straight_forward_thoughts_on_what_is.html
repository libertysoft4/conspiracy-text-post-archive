        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>There is much wrong with the happenings and public mindset right now.  <em>I&#39;ll try to illustrate a couple points simply.</em></p>

<p><strong>DNC:</strong> &quot;Russia hacked us and exposed all our corruption; this led to trumps win.  This isn&#39;t right.. we must deny Trumps win.</p>

<p><strong>Reality check:</strong>  Whether or not Russia did the hack... the DNC&#39;s bad behavior and corruption was exposed either way.  Russia being the source or not SHOULD NOT OVERSHADOW the fact that the DNC/Hilary campaign are proven to be very very dirty.  There should be no argument for their favor here. Yet in smoke and mirrors we disregard the exposed corruption and still listen to the DNC narrative.</p>

<p><em>Another absurd stance on things:</em></p>

<p><strong>General HRC supporters and or Trump haters:</strong>  &quot;Wikileaks just hacked Hilary and not Trump.  This isn&#39;t fair and caused trump to win.&quot;</p>

<p><strong>Reality check:</strong>  This inherently is a broken mindset suggesting that you believe and accept corruption on BOTH sides.  Instead of reacting appropriately to the corruption exposed on the DNC we wonder where the exposure is on the RNC... Why do you accept corruption from the DNC? Why is your argument &quot;well, we should have exposed the corruption on the RNC side to be fair.. but we didn&#39;t.. so Hilary should still win..&quot;  What if there is no comparable corruption on the RNC side?  Accept the DNC corruption; react accordingly.</p>

<p>Don&#39;t let your personal distaste for trump outweigh your understanding that the global elities controlling the DNC are corupt af!</p>

<p>Stop living in a world where you accept corruption from both parties in your two party system.</p>

<p>Convert &quot;Why wasn&#39;t the RNC hacked tooooooo&quot;  Into &quot;Fuck, the DNC and Hilary are nasty... we need an alternative solution.&quot;</p>

<p><em>This whole moment in time is very confusing:</em></p>

<ul>
<li><p>-MSM/DNC made the general public fear and hate trump prior to election.</p></li>
<li><p>-DNC/Hilary exposed for being corrupt and players in the global elitist narrative prior to election.</p></li>
<li><p>-Trump wins, traditionally, democratically.</p></li>
<li><p>-General public (taught to fear and hate trump) freak out.</p></li>
<li><p>-DNC &quot;align&quot; with the general public and try to secure their win with a failed recount attempt (displays that Trump has MORE votes than originally counted)</p></li>
<li><p>-DNC&#39;s control over the narrative weakens as alt media and communities unravel the thread in this VERY messy situation.</p></li>
<li><p>-DNC pushes propaganda/censorship/fake news. (legislature including)</p></li>
<li><p>-DNC/MSM label real news as fake and fake news as real.</p></li>
<li><p>-Everyone in the country is confused.</p></li>
<li><p>-A complete undermining of Democracy (peoples choice) underway as the DNC try to take the victory using an electoral change of heart.</p></li>
<li><p>-Our democracy is on the verge of a literal failure.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Further more, if the DNC are trying to change the outcome and be reconsidered due to &quot;rigging&quot; of the outcome... CAN WE JUST INCLUDE BERNIE SANDERS IN THE MIX?  THE PRIMARIES WERE RIGGED BY THE DNC... if we are going to reconsider and take &quot;rigging&quot; into account... lets start with the primaries and hold another election with Sanders and Trump.</p>

<p>Personally, I hope Trump and his cabinet of generals are just &quot;playing nice&quot; at the moment.  I hope that if/when he takes office they lay the smack down on evil/corruption in this country and prosecute Hilary/Podesta/and other global elitist puppets.</p>

<p>Stay woke.

<p>EDIT: formatting
EDIT2: Removed all caps sentences; replaced with standard letters.  Sorry for that! &lt;3
EDIT3: Adding the actual conspiracy thoughts lol vvv</p>

<p>&#39;[9  &lt;--------- THIS was my cat typing...</p>

<p>But thats not the conspiracy! Is it fake news?  ugh.. what a trip that whole piece is.</p>

<p>Hey peeps thanks for all the thoughts.  This thread rocks.  I didn&#39;t really realize that I was suppressing all the real good conspiracy meat from the picture of the game above... so lets kick it!</p>

<p>Ok, so <em>An Tart I CA</em> (I guess I should try to be safe but lets face it.... <em>who is tarting in California!?</em></p>

<p>WTF is going on down there?... closed off for public excursions... 35 year treaties to stop fishing the waters (no witnesses)... Base 211, was it?  Nearly wiped out everyone in an american investigation A LOT of german submarine traffic and possible base.  An account of the event was that ships came straight up out of the water and flew faster then anything the americans had. ( relevant link: <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/5i7v02/with_antarctica_trending_new_conspiracy_interests/">https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/5i7v02/with_antarctica_trending_new_conspiracy_interests/</a> )</p>

<p><strong>Btw while were on the subject of UFO&#39;s.. does anyone have anything the likes of space/military/ufo/major deals/project blue beam/firesign on that last super full moon?</strong></p>

<p>Is there some kind of meeting/arrival/awakening that has happened or is happening or is gunna happen in <em>An Tart I CA?</em></p>

<p>Buzz Aldren being the face of a first big jigsaw moment when we discovered whats on the dark side of the moon?  Some sort of old business face deal maker?</p>

<p>Did that whole Buzz Aldren <em>~something is fucking evil</em> in <em>An Tart I CA?</em> tweet post and quick deletion get debunked? Or was that some real human quick tweet of warning?</p>

<p>Jeeze people, what if there is a big ass fight/business deal/sacrifice/contact between some Atlantian Aliens possibly based in <em>An Tart I CA/the dark side or inside of the moon</em> with humans and possibly another alien population riding in fast on Planet 9?</p>

<p>Im personally hoping that there has been secret mind control illusion bull over us... So that way I will be blown away by our existence when a righteous species of Aliens rides into the skies on chariots of fire and remove the whole illusion.  It will feel so amazing restoring our most awesome human bodies and spirits to regain effectiveness in a whole new world of wonder, magic, and galactic communities.  <em>bring your mixtape.</em></p>

<p>Yo so, whats up with these markets?  Dow nearly clearing 20,000 today?  Does this seem inflated?  Those global elites love a good market crash... well, looks like we have to rebuild it? Ah yes this &quot;one world&quot; currency idea.</p>

<p>Is gold part of this?  Ok I&#39;m reaching... but I recall like a decade ago while researching Nibiru (might be our Planet 9?) that a race of aliens have a natural home where the atmosphere is made of gold.  Was there a &quot;booby trap&quot; on the moon to alert some alien race that space travel was achieved by a lifeforms on earth and thus have refined the gold.  Was fort knox cleared out for a deal with these Aliens?</p>

<p>Oh snap guys!! <em>Peter Beter</em> (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Beter">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Beter</a>) had a Conspiracy that all the gold had been cleared out of Fort Knox at prices below market value in 1974... Public news 5 years after 1969 (Moon trigger)  Beter claimed that:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Vice President Lyndon B. Johnson was involved in the Kennedy assassination.</p></li>
<li><p>Several important public figures such as David Rockefeller, Henry Kissinger, and Jimmy Carter are actually dead, and are being impersonated by organic &quot;robotoids&quot;</p></li>
<li><p>Patty Hearst was kidnapped by the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) after the Hearst newspaper chain published secret Congressional testimony. This testimony revealed that America&#39;s atomic secrets were handed over to the Soviet Union - not stolen by Soviet spies, before America&#39;s first atomic bomb was finished, and that the Rockefellers were directly involved in this plot.</p></li>
<li><p>The CIA was responsible for the secret death of General George Scratchley Brown because he simply knew &quot;too much</p></li>
<li><p>The Jonestown massacre was staged to camouflage a joint U.S.-Israeli military operation to destroy a Soviet missile base in Guyana. The Jonestown incident explained the movement of U.S. military personnel into Guyana and concealed the real count of casualties from the attack on the Soviet base.</p></li>
<li><p>Particle beam weapons and other advanced aerial weapons under secret development had the power to change the weather. Both the U.S. and the Soviet Union had developed such weapons.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Whoa... this guy was onto something... Im going to say it.. he looks like Alex Jones ( <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Beter#/media/File:Peter_David_Beter.gif">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Beter#/media/File:Peter_David_Beter.gif</a> )</p>

<p>Ok so, &quot;Robotoids&quot; maybe <em>reptilians?</em> Maybe clones or actual robots?  Is Kanye one of these?  A &quot;robotoid&quot; or <em>reptilian?</em> either would have a hard time impersonating the likes of Kanye.</p>

<p>Whats with this huge <strong>space weather</strong> event thats approaching supposedly on December 26 2016? ( <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0isfkb0duN4&amp;t=07m33s">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0isfkb0duN4&amp;t=07m33s</a> )
Are the global elites being replaced by robots and the &quot;out of line&quot; sheeples like Kanye are as well?</p>

<p>Are the global elites leaving earth and leaving us with Trump?</p>

<p>I just want righteous aliens, to live to our full potential, and to become part of a galactic community.</p>

<p>Im out for now peeps.
_orion</p>

<p>THE FAR SIDE SLEEPY YARD: what if we can see some galactic happenings at certain times in certain places as the sun goes down.... The elite want to mask that so they we have chemtrails dropping the material for a canopy projection screen.  Im not talking your bulb loaded cinema projector... Im talking a <strong>Project Bluebeam</strong> something very much like what is used at the Starfire Optical Range for lidar and laser guide star experiments.  (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starfire_Optical_Range">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starfire_Optical_Range</a> &lt;---Really cool tech to see here btw)  They have a Lidar that is tuned to the sodium D2a line and used to excite sodium atoms in the upper atmosphere.  Seems easy enough to fake the stars at night... Maybe some <strong>chemtrail</strong> conspiracy leads there.  Pair it with a nice touch of <strong>HAARP.</strong>  *oh yeah, datz real guud.  What was it today?  An aerosol in the atmosphere could cause a cool in temperatures...
&quot;Yeah, we can&#39;t have any backlight for our projection screen.  oh? You&#39;re cold? Yeah the sun was nice there for a bit huh? Well why don&#39;t you just go put a coat on sweetheart!  The projection show is starting!&quot;</p>

<p>EDIT4:Tagging <a href="/u/Yum_Kaax">/u/Yum_Kaax</a> cause he was looking for the conspiracy in the original post.  :D

    <div class="md"><p>Trump is a part of the same system as Hillary.  That&#39;s the only disagreement I have with you.</p>

<p>I think that the whole Trump vs. Hillary is being used to disguise the fact that there is no REAL difference in left vs. right.  Just what lies they tell their supporters they care about, when in reality, they&#39;re making backroom deals and inflating eachothers&#39; pocketbooks and egos.</p>

<p>The truth is that whoever is president will preside over an economic disaster the likes of which have never been seen.</p>

<p>The truth is that the longer we spend time fighting Trump vs. Hillary, the less time we spend trying to fix a broken system that doesn&#39;t give a fuck about you and yours or me and mine, regardless of party lines.</p>

<p>The truth is, this is all reality TV meant to keep you entertained and placated and to give you something to talk about that&#39;s not the coming resource squeeze and economic crash.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The establishment rigged the election.  Trump won anyways.  </p>

<p>Over this period, we&#39;ve learned that the establishment has their hands in child sex rings, regime changing soveriegn nations, and have been exploiting the US public for two or three decades.  Also, the establishment has ~1 billion in bribe payments from this election season alone they need to start getting square on that failed when Clinton lost.</p>

<p>Besides that, everyone is playing it cool like they aren&#39;t going to be going to jail, but then behind the scenes they are doing everything they can to stop Trump because they know exactly how much trouble they are in.  First the recounts failed, now they are saying the whole process was &quot;hacked&quot;.  </p>

<p>Now you know why they are playing it cool in the media but doing everything they can to stop him from actually taking office.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, you do have a point.  I must say I&#39;m a fan of <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> ...</p>

<p>I&#39;ve been addicted to this thread.  I want more than anything for Aliens and Zero Point Energy to be real/etc... </p>

<p>Much of the current Conspiracy&#39;s are surrounding the global elite..  There is much surrounding &quot;fake news&quot; conspiracy&#39;s and &quot;Russia propaganda&quot; conspiracy&#39;s.</p>

<p>I had some thoughts on the grounds of these conspiracy&#39;s.. thus it has political points.</p>

<p>I feel you.  Sorry to add to the torrent that is distracting us from the more fun conspiracy&#39;s.</p>

<p>ONTO THOSE:</p>

<p>Are Aliens about to be disclosed?  Is there a energy wave &quot;space weather&quot; emergency approaching!?</p>
